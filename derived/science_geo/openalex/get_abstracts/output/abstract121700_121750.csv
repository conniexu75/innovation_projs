The present studies were undertaken to test if different classes of muscle proteins are degraded by this pathway. In extracts of rabbit psoas muscle, the complete degradation of soluble proteins to amino acids was stimulated up to 6-fold by ATP. Peptide aldehyde inhibitors of the proteasome or the removal of proteasomes markedly inhibited only the ATP-dependent process. Addition of purified myosin, actin, troponin, or tropomyosin to these extracts showed that these proteins served as substrates for the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. By contrast, degradation of myoglobin did not require ATP, proteasomes, or any known proteases in muscles.When myosin, actin, and troponin were added as actomyosin complexes or as intact myofibrils to these extracts, they were not hydrolyzed at a significant rate, probably because in these multicomponent complexes, these proteins are protected from degradation. Accordingly, actin (but not albumin or troponin) inhibited the degradation of 125I-myosin, and actin was found to selectively inhibit ubiquitin conjugation to 125I-myosin. Also, the presence of tropomyosin inhibited the degradation of 125I-troponin. However, neither actin nor tropomyosin inhibited the degradation of 125I-lysozyme or soluble muscle proteins. Thus, specific interactions between the myofibrillar proteins appear to protect them from ubiquitin-dependent degradation, and the rate-limiting step in their degradation is probably their dissociation from the myofibril.

Thus, specific interactions between the myofibrillar proteins appear to protect them from ubiquitin-dependent degradation, and the rate-limiting step in their degradation is probably their dissociation from the myofibril. In both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, the degradation of most proteins requires ATP (1Gronostajski R. Pardee A.B. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol.

In eukaryotes, this energy requirement is primarily due to the ATP-requiring proteolytic system, involving the polypeptide cofactor ubiquitin (Ub), 1The abbreviations used are: UbubiquitinATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)GSTglutathione S-transferaseDTTdithiothreitolPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideBSAbovine serum albuminCbz-benzyloxycarbonyl. and the proteasome (3Ciechanover A.

Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). In this pathway, protein substrates are initially conjugated covalently to Ub by an ATP-requiring process (4Finley D. Chau V. Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol. 1991; 7: 25-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 5Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). This modification marks the proteins for rapid degradation by the ATP-dependent 26 S (2000 kDa) proteasome complex (6Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar, 7Goldberg A.L. Ross S. Adams J. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 503-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The proteolytic core of this large structure is the 20 S proteasome, which contains multiple peptidase activities. Ub conjugation is believed to be the rate-limiting step in this pathway (3Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar, 5Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar), in which most substrates are completely hydrolyzed to free amino acids. It has generally been believed that the primary role of this pathway is to degrade abnormal proteins and short-lived regulatory components (8Etlinger J. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 9Hershko A. Eytan E. Ciechanover A. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13964-13970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent studies using proteasome inhibitors (10Rock K.L. Gramn C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L.

Chem. 1985; 260: 3344-3349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that this pathway also catalyzes the breakdown of most long-lived proteins in cultured mammalian cells. In addition, various studies of isolated skeletal muscles suggest that the rapid loss of muscle protein in fasting (11Medina R. Wing S.S. Goldberg AL.

In addition to the Ub-proteasome system, skeletal muscles contain at least three other proteolytic systems that can contribute to intracellular proteolysis. 1) Lysosomal proteases are responsible for degradation of endocytosed proteins and many membrane proteins (19Furuno K. Goldberg A.L. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 20Dice J.F. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 21Lardeux B.R. Mortimore G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14514-14519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2) A still poorly defined nonlysosomal degradative system that functions independently of ATP (1Gronostajski R. Pardee A.B. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3344-3349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wing S.S. Goldberg A.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: E676-E688Google Scholar). In red blood cells, this system appears to be responsible for the rapid degradation of oxidatively damaged hemoglobins (23Davies K.J.A. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8227-8234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Fagan J.M. Waxman L. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5705-5713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is conflicting evidence whether this process involves the proteasome (25Giulivi C. Pacifici R.E. Davies K.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) or a distinct proteolytic system (26Matthews W. Tanaka K. Driscoll J. Ichihara A. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2597-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), such as the insulin-degrading enzyme (27Fagan J.M. Waxman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23015-23022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3) The cytosol also contains two Ca2+-activated proteases, calpain-μ and -m, whose in vivo function in normal cells remains unclear (28Demartino G.N. Goldberg A.L. Enzyme. 1981; 26: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The precise roles of all these degradative systems in the breakdown of different muscle proteins are yet to be determined. Knowledge about the physiological importance of the Ub-proteasome pathway in mammals has advanced slowly largely because of the lack of effective inhibitors. Recently, competitive inhibitors of the 20 S proteasome that block protein degradation in intact cells have been identified (6Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar, 10Rock K.L. Gramn C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar). For example, certain peptide aldehydes (e.g. Cbz-Leu-Leu-leucinal, MG132) inhibit the chymotryptic and peptidylglutamyl peptidase activities (10Rock K.L. Gramn C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar), and thereby reduce the degradation of Ub-conjugated proteins. In lymphoblasts, these agents reduce the degradation of the bulk of cell proteins and similarly inhibit the breakdown of short- and long-lived proteins (10Rock K.L. Gramn C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar). The system that degrades the long-lived contractile proteins of the myofibrils had long been unclear. Recently, proteasome inhibitors have been shown to decrease the overall proteolysis in incubated rat muscles and especially the enhanced degradation characteristic of atrophying muscles, in which breakdown of myofibrillar proteins is accelerated (29Bailey J.L. Wang X. England B.K. Price S.R. Ding X. Mitch W.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). 3N. Tawa, S. Brandt, R. Odessey, and A. L. Goldberg, manuscript in preparation. These studies suggesting an important role of the Ub-proteasome pathway in muscle have all been indirect and have not utilized specific muscle proteins as substrates. Of particular interest is the proteolytic system that degrades myofibrillar proteins, which comprise the majority of muscle proteins. In the sarcomere, such proteins are in an insoluble, highly ordered structure. The rate-limiting steps in their degradation and the responsible proteases are unknown. These studies were undertaken to investigate the capacity of the ATP-proteasome pathway in skeletal muscle to degrade soluble muscle proteins and the major myofibrillar components, and to explore the conditions that may favor their degradation. Protein substrates and reagents were purchased from Sigma. The monoclonal antibody against the insulin-degrading protease was kindly provided by Dr. R. A. Roth (Stanford University, Stanford, California). The proteasome inhibitors MG101 (N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal) and MG132 (Cbz-Leu-Leu-leucinal) were kindly provided by ProScript, Inc. (formerly MyoGenics, Inc., Cambridge, MA). Myofibrils were isolated in bulk from fresh rabbit psoas muscles and purified as described previously (31Perry S.V. Corsi A. Biochem. J. 1958; 68: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Myosin, actin, and troponin were labeled with 125I using the chloramine-T procedure (32Ciechanover A. Heller H. Elias S. Haas A.L. Hershko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1365-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), and myoglobin was labeled with [14C]formaldehyde (33Dottavio-Martin D. Ravel J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Male New Zealand White rabbits (3-4 kg) were killed by lethal injection of sodium pentabarbitol, and the extracts from psoas muscles were prepared as described earlier (34Fagan J.M. Waxman L. Goldberg A.L. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Homogenates were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min to remove myofibrils. “Crude extracts” were prepared by centrifuging the supernatants at 100,000 × g for 1 h and were either studied directly or fractionated on DEAE-cellulose (34Fagan J.M. Waxman L. Goldberg A.L. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) into Fraction II, the resin-bound material, which contains the proteasomes and most of the enzymes required for Ub conjugation; and Fraction I, the flow-through, which contains Ub and certain enzymes required for ubiquitination and degradation of N-α-acetylated proteins (35Gonen H. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19221-19231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Gonen H. Smith C.E. Siegel N.R. Kahana C. Merrick W.C. Chakraburtty K. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7648-7652Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Both crude extracts and Fraction II were then dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 2 mM DTT, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 20 mM potassium chloride, and 10% glycerol and stored at −70°C until use. All assays of proteolysis were linear with time for up to 2 h. The data in a specific figure or table were obtained in a single experiment and are the averages of triplicate determinations, which agreed within 10%. All experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. However, the specific activity of the degradative system varied from preparation to preparation. Protein content was measured using BSA as the standard by the Bradford method (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The proteasome's peptidase activity was measured by following the hydrolysis of fluorometric substrate, Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-MCA, as described previously (38Driscoll J. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 787-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Degradation of soluble proteins in crude extracts and Fraction II was measured by assaying the free tyrosine in the trichloroacetic acid-soluble supernatant (34Fagan J.M. Waxman L. Goldberg A.L. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Since muscles neither synthesize nor degrade this amino acid, its accumulation reflects the net degradation of proteins (39Fulks R.M. Li J.B. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 290-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments with Fraction II, the degradation of endogenous proteins was measured upon addition of Ub (100 μg/ml reaction mixture), since removal of Fraction I from the crude extracts eliminates most of the Ub (34Fagan J.M. Waxman L. Goldberg A.L. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Breakdown of 125I-labeled proteins or [14C]myoglobin in the crude extracts was measured by following the release of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity using a γ or liquid-scintillation counter. Alternatively, 50-75 μg of the non-labeled protein substrates were added to the reaction mixture containing 1-2 mg of soluble crude extracts in 0.1 ml of buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 2 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 5% glycerol), with or without 2 mM ATP. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 90 min, and to terminate reactions at the end of the incubation period, trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration) was added to all reaction mixtures. The total amount of tyrosine released from proteins was measured fluorometrically (39Fulks R.M. Li J.B. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 290-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of tyrosine generated by breakdown of the exogenous protein substrate was then calculated by subtracting from the total amount of tyrosine generated (i.e. total proteolysis) the amount of tyrosine released by breakdown of the endogenous soluble proteins measured in a parallel incubation, in which no exogenous substrate was added to the extracts. As reported previously (34Fagan J.M. Waxman L. Goldberg A.L. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the soluble extracts of muscles after dialysis (to remove free amino acids) degraded endogenous proteins completely to amino acids, as shown by the appearance of free tyrosine. This process was linear for 2 h at 37°C and was stimulated 3-6-fold by ATP (Fig. 1, top). To test if proteasomes are required for the ATP-dependent process, two approaches were used. First, most of the proteasomes were removed from the crude extracts by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 6 h (40Hegde A.N. Goldberg A.L. Schwartz J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7436-7440Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To confirm that the proteasome content was in fact reduced, we assayed the hydrolysis of Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-MCA, a preferred substrate of the proteasome (41Fisher M. Hilt W. Richter-Ruoff B. Gonen H. Ciechanover A. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This activity was 60-70% lower after ultracentrifugation than in the whole extracts before centrifugation. This loss of proteasomes did not alter the proteolysis seen in the absence of ATP, but reduced the ATP-stimulated breakdown of soluble proteins by 70% (Table I).Table IRequirement of proteasomes for the ATP-stimulated degradation of soluble and myofibrillar proteinsProtein substratesCrude extractExtract depleted of proteasomesInhibitionpmol of tyrosine%Endogenous proteins5509083Myosin3950100Actin4707085Tropomyosin3853092Troponin4304090 Open table in a new tab In addition, we tested the effects of the peptide aldehyde inhibitors of the proteasome, MG101 (N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal) and MG132 (Cbz-Leu-Leu-leucinal). Both these inhibitors competitively inhibit the peptidase activities of the 20 S proteasome (10Rock K.L. Gramn C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar) and reduce proteolysis in isolated rat muscle (29Bailey J.L. Wang X. England B.K. Price S.R. Ding X. Mitch W.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar).3 Addition of either agent to the crude extracts inhibited the ATP-stimulated breakdown of endogenous proteins, while the much lower ATP-independent activity was largely unchanged (Fig. 2). MG132 is a much more potent inhibitor of the 20 S and 26 S proteasomes than MG101 (10Rock K.L. Gramn C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar). Accordingly, 50% inhibition of the ATP-stimulated proteolysis was observed with MG132 at 40 μM and at >100 μM for MG101. Although both agents can also inhibit lysosomal proteases and calpains, under these experimental conditions (pH 7.4 in the absence of Ca2+), these enzymes should be inactive. Thus, the proteasome is necessary for the ATP-dependent degradation of soluble muscle proteins. To test whether this ATP-proteasome-dependent process also requires Ub, DEAE-cellulose chromatography was performed. The fraction that did not bind to the column (Fraction I) contained Ub (34Fagan J.M. Waxman L. Goldberg A.L. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), while the bound fraction (Fraction II) contained proteasomes and certain Ub-conjugating enzymes (3Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar, 42Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1992; 33: 19-56Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Both fractions were essential for reconstitution of the ATP-dependent process. Addition of ATP alone to Fraction II did not stimulate tyrosine production, but Fraction I and ATP restored the protein degradation (data not shown). The active component in Fraction I appeared to be Ub, since addition of purified Ub to ATP-supplemented Fraction II stimulated up to 6-fold the degradation of endogenous proteins (Fig. 1, F-II), which occurred at a linear rate for 2 h. Thus, degradation of soluble muscle proteins involves the Ub-proteasome pathway. Subsequent studies tested whether the ATP-proteasome pathway also catalyzes the degradation of individual myofibrillar proteins added to these soluble extracts (from which myofibrils had been removed). Addition of purified myosin had little effect on tyrosine production in the absence of ATP, but in its presence caused up to a 3-fold increase in tyrosine production (Fig. 3). Thus, native myosin appeared to be a substrate for this degradative pathway. In order to verify that this effect of myosin is, in fact, due to its degradation (rather than to a stimulation of the breakdown of some protein(s) in the extracts), 125I-myosin was used as a substrate. In the presence of ATP, 125I-myosin was hydrolyzed 2-3 times faster than in its absence (Fig. 3). This result was observed consistently, although the rate of myosin degradation varied in different preparations of extracts. The degradation of native as well as 125I-myosin was linear for up to 2 h. By contrast, at 25°C, no degradation of either myosin was observed in 2 h, even in the presence of ATP (data not shown). Thus, the increase in tyrosine production is due to myosin degradation. Similarly, addition of native actin, troponin, or tropomyosin individually to the crude extracts increased production of tyrosine, especially in the presence of ATP, apparently because these proteins were degraded in an ATP-stimulated manner (Table II). Accordingly, 125I-actin and 125I-troponin were also hydrolyzed, and ATP stimulated this process up to 6-fold. Moreover, the increase in tyrosine production was proportional to the added amount of actin or troponin or tropomyosin (up to 1 mg/ml) (data not shown). Therefore, the extent of hydrolysis of the non-labeled exogenous substrate added (i.e. the amount of tyrosine generated by its hydrolysis) could be determined simply by subtracting from the total free tyrosine production, the amount produced by breakdown of endogenous proteins (i.e. in the absence of an exogenous protein). This non-labeled approach could also be used to follow the degradation of non-myofibrillar exogenous substrates, such as lysozyme, which was hydrolyzed in an ATP-stimulated fashion similar to 125I-lysozyme (data not shown)Table IIMyofibrillar proteins are degraded rapidly in an ATP-dependent manner when isolated, but not when associated in myofibrilsSubstratesProteolysis+ATP/−ATP−ATP+ATPpmol of tyrosineMyosin1504152.75Actin1106305.7Tropomyosin2206803.1Troponin4158452.0Actomyosin75901.2Myofibrils24401.6 Open table in a new tab To follow the degradation of native myosin, the amount of myosin substrate added to the extracts was critical. At low concentrations (<0.3 mg/ml), no significant increase in tyrosine production could be measured, while at high concentrations (>1 mg/ml), myosin aggregates and precipitates in the low ionic strength reaction buffer. Addition of myosin at concentrations above 1 mg/ml inhibited total proteolysis, probably due to the coprecipitation of some components of the degradative pathway with the myosin (unfortunately, the high-salt concentrations that maintain myosin in solution inhibit the ATP-dependent proteolytic activity). Unlike myosin and actin, which were degraded efficiently only in the presence of ATP, troponin and tropomyosin were degraded significantly in the absence of ATP, although this process was stimulated further when ATP was added (Table II). To confirm that proteasomes are essential for the ATP-dependent degradation of these myofibrillar proteins, we examined the effects of proteasome depletion by prolonged ultracentrifugation, as described above. This treatment did not alter the ATP-independent activity against these various substrates; however, the ATP-stimulated degradation of myosin, actin, and troponin was reduced by 70%. The high molecular weight component(s) necessary for this ATP-stimulated degradation process are probably proteasomes (Table I). Further evidence for the involvement of proteasomes in the breakdown of 125I-labeled myosin, actin, and troponin was obtained by studying the effects of inhibitors of various proteases (Table III). Addition of proteasome inhibitors MG101 and MG132 significantly reduced the ATP-stimulated degradation of these myofibrillar proteins, while the ATP-independent activity remained unchanged. By contrast, E64 (which covalently inactivates several cysteine proteases present in muscle, e.g. cathepsins B, H, and L, as well as the calpains), or leupeptin (a reversible inhibitor of these enzymes) had negligible effect on the degradation of myofibrillar proteins (Table III). The insulin-degrading metalloprotease had been proposed to play a role in later steps in an ATP-dependent proteolytic pathway (43Kirschner R.J. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol.

However, complete removal of this metalloprotease from the crude extracts by immunoprecipitation did not affect either the ATP-independent or -dependent degradation of myofibrillar proteins to amino acids (data not shown).

After removal of Fraction I by DEAE-chromatography, no degradation of these proteins was observed, unless Fraction I was added back to the Fraction II. Addition of purified Ub and ATP to Fraction II did not stimulate the degradation of any of these myofibrillar proteins. Some factor(s) in Fraction I, in addition to Ub, are therefore required specifically for degradation of these myofibrillar proteins. As shown below, Ub could be conjugated to myosin in an ATP-dependent manner in crude extracts, but not in Fraction II alone (see below). Furthermore, recent studies (35Gonen H. Schwartz A.L.

We investigated one possible mechanism of neurotoxicity, namely Aβ-membrane lipid interactions. We find that Aβ disrupts membranes containing acidic phospholipids. This disruption is greater at slightly acidic pH (characteristic of endosomes) than at neutral pH (characteristic of the extracellular space). This pH dependence suggests that Aβ has the capacity to disrupt endosomal and plasma membranes, and this disruption could account, at least in part, for the observed neurotoxic effects of the peptide. We also find that gangliosides induce Aβ to adopt a novel α/β conformation at neutral pH. Increasing evidence implicates Aβ peptides as neurotoxic agents in Alzheimer's disease.

The major component of the amyloid deposits is Aβ, a family of 39-43-residue peptides. Insoluble Aβ in AD brains exist either as amorphous deposits called diffuse amyloid or as dense cores of deposits called senile plaques. Diffuse amyloid and senile plaques can be distinguished by their differential staining patterns obtained with Congo Red (1Selkoe D.J.

Many in vitro studies have demonstrated that Aβ can be neurotoxic but only when it forms fibrils (11Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J.

Possible mechanisms for Aβ neurotoxicity include (a) alterations in Ca2+ homeostasis, (b) activation of specific receptors affecting cellular homeostasis, (c) direct disruption of membrane integrity, or (d) a combination of two or more of the above mechanisms. Several studies indicate that Aβ neurotoxicity may be mediated, at least in part, by direct interactions between Aβ and membrane lipids. Arispe et al. (16Arispe N. Pollard H.B. Rojas E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10573-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Aβ40 forms cation-selective channels in membranes and have speculated that these channels disrupt ion homeostasis and thus cause toxicity. Terzi et al. (17Terzi E. Holzemann G. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7434-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 18Terzi E. Holzemann G. Seelig J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) investigated the interaction of phosphatidylcholine (PC)/phosphatidylglycerol (PG) vesicles with Aβ peptides using biophysical techniques. Both Aβ25-35 and Aβ40 were shown to form β-sheet structures upon addition of PC/PG vesicles at pH 7.0; however, supraphysiological concentrations of Aβ, 200 μM, were required for the conformational transition. Terzi and co-workers (18Terzi E. Holzemann G. Seelig J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) also state that the techniques they employed could not determine whether the Aβ peptides penetrated into the lipid membrane or aggregated on the membrane surface. Recently, a novel ganglioside-bound Aβ species was isolated from AD brain homogenates (19Yanagisawa K. Odaka A. Suzuki N. Ihara Y. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1062-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). This form was identified as Aβ42 and speculated to be localized on the cell surface where it can act as a seed for amyloid fibril formation. The experimental studies summarized above provide evidence suggesting that Aβ neurotoxicity stems from interactions of Aβ with membrane proteins or lipids. In the present study, we investigate the nature of the interactions of Aβ with phospholipids and gangliosides. Some of the questions we have addressed include the following. Does Aβ aggregate into fibrils and then partition into the membrane or is the interaction mediated through some other mechanism? Do membrane interactions differ between Aβ40 and Aβ42? And finally, do Aβ-membrane interactions at slightly acidic pH (characteristic of endosomes) differ from those at neutral pH (characteristic of the extracellular space)? Aβ40, Aβ42, and Aβ25-35 were purchased from Bachem Biosciences Inc. (King of Prussia, PA). Peptides were initially dissolved in 0.5 ml of 100% trifluoroacetic acid (Aldrich) diluted in distilled H2O and immediately lyophilized. The lyophilized peptide was then dissolved in 40% (v/v) trifluoroethanol (Aldrich) in H2O and stored at −20°C until use. Aβ9-25 was synthesized on a Milligen 9050 Pepsynthesizer (Bedford, MA) and purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Purity of peptide was confirmed by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. Nucleation seeds were removed from peptide stock solutions by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min on a Beckman Airfuge (Beckman, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The supernatant was diluted immediately into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 6.0 or 7.0. Samples were incubated with continual stirring for the indicated periods. Fibril formation was followed at 400 nm by 90° light scattering on a Photon Technology International Fluorimeter (South Brunswick, NJ). Pure phospholipids, mixtures of bovine brain PG, PS, PA, PC (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), the mixed ganglioside fraction of bovine brain, and pure gangliosides (Sigmas) were dissolved in either chloroform/methanol (1:1 v/v) (50 μg/ml). Mixed ganglioside fractions are composed of predominantly GM1, and the remainder consisting of GM2, GD1a, GD1b, and GT series. All mixtures of lipids were at a 1:1 ratio by weight. All lipid aliquots were dried under a stream of nitrogen, lyophilized overnight, and suspended in PBS, pH 7.0, in the presence or absence of a saturated solution of 5-(and −6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). Lipid suspensions were carried through 10 cycles of freeze-thaw in an acetone:dry ice bath. Small unilamellar vesicles were then prepared by sonication for 20 min in a bath sonicator (Branson Ultrasonic Corp., Danbury, CT). Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared by passage through 100-nm polycarbonate membranes with the Liposofast system (Avestin Inc., Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). Column chromatography on Sepharose 4B (Sigmas) (1.5 × 12 cm) was used to separate free dye from dye-loaded vesicles. Concentration of the phospholipid vesicles was determined using the Bartlett assay (20Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dye-loaded vesicles were diluted in PBS, pH 6.0 or pH 7.0, to a final lipid concentration of 20 μM. After 50 s incubation (with continual stirring), Aβ peptide samples, bee venom mellitin (Sigmas), or solvent controls were added at a 1:20 peptide:lipid ratio. The final peptide concentration was 1.0 μM. To monitor dye leakage, we used a Photon Technology International Fluorimeter. Excitation was at 506 nm and emission was monitored at 524 nm with a 4 nM bandwidth. Data were collected at a rate of one data point every 5 s. At the end of the experiment, 10% Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.3% to obtain complete dye release and measure total fluorescence. Vesicles were not used unless the total fluorescence was greater than 200% of the initial fluorescence. The percentage of total dye release was defined as: %dye release=100%×( observed fluorescence − initial fluorescence )( total fluorescence − initial fluorescence )(Eq. 1) To control for artifacts arising from light scattering, the dye release assay was also performed with vesicles free of dye. CD spectra were recorded on an Aviv Circular Dichroism Spectrometer Model 62DS (Lakewood, NJ) at 25°C. Spectra were obtained from 200 to 260 nm, with a 0.5-nm step, 1-nm bandwidth, and 20-s collection time per step. Peptide:lipid ratios were maintained at 1:20 with a final peptide concentration of 10 μM. The effect of various lipids on peptide conformation was determined by adding an aliquot of stock peptide solutions to lipid vesicles suspended in PBS with continual stirring. The contribution of lipid vesicles to the CD signal was removed by subtracting the CD spectra of pure lipid vesicles from the CD spectra of peptide-lipid suspensions. Stock peptide conformations were determined in TFE/H2O under the same conditions. The ability of Aβ to disrupt lipid membranes was assessed using a dye release assay. This assay involves encapsulating a self-quenching fluorescent dye in lipid vesicles and monitoring the increase in fluorescence upon addition of a membrane disrupting molecule. We used 5-(and 6-) carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein as the dye because its fluorescence is independent of pH above 5.7. We found identical results when vesicles were prepared as either large or small unilamellar vesicles (data not shown). The integrity of the vesicles was determined by monitoring spontaneous diffusion of dye over time (Table I). If the spontaneous dye release exceeded 10% of the total release vesicles or if bee venom mellitin, a 26-amino acid cytotoxic peptide (21Kempf C. Klausner R.D. Weinstein J.N. Van Renswoude J. Pincus M. Blumenthal R. J. Biol.

To simulate this process, we prepared concentrated stock solutions of peptides in 40% trifluoroethanol (TFE), conditions that maintain Aβ in monomeric helical form (22Barrow C.J. Zagorski M.G. Science. 1991; 253: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), and then diluted the stock solutions into assay medium containing dye-loaded vesicles. The final concentration of TFE in a typical assay was 0.4%. This amount of TFE did not compromise the integrity of the vesicles (Table I). All experiments were done at physiological salt concentrations and at 1 μM peptide concentration unless otherwise stated. Although still supraphysiological, this peptide concentration approaches physiological levels more closely than previous studies. Experiments were performed at pH 6.0 and pH 7.0 to simulate the endosomal and extracellular environments, respectively. The ability of Aβ40 (Fig. 1) and Aβ42 (Fig. 2) to disrupt phospholipid vesicles composed of either PG or PC was examined. When Aβ40 was added to PG vesicles at pH 6.0, a dramatic release of dye was detected (Fig. 1A), indicating that Aβ40 disrupts the bilayer, allowing approximately 80% of the encapsulated dye to escape. Aβ40 induced a more modest disruption of vesicles composed of phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylserine (PS) at pH 6.0. 2J. McLaurin and A. Chakrabartty, unpublished data. Aβ40 also disrupted PG vesicles at pH 7.0; however, the extent was decreased to 20% release of the encapsulated dye (Fig. 1B). Unlike the effect we observed with acidic phospholipids (PG, PA, and PS), Aβ40 did not disrupt PC vesicles at either pH 6.0 (Fig. 1A) or pH 7.0 (Fig. 1B). Thus, the membrane disrupting activity of Aβ40 displays a specificity for acidic phospholipids. Membrane disrupting activity and phospholipid specificity of Aβ42 (Fig. 2A) were similar to Aβ40 at pH 6.0; however, at pH 7.0 Aβ42 was inactive (Fig. 2B). The error associated with light scattering, from Aβ-induced aggregation of lipid vesicles, was found to be approximately 4% of the total fluorescence from the dye release assay and therefore negligible to the interpretation of our results.Fig. 2Dye release assay from phospholipid and ganglioside vesicles by Aβ42. Peptide was added to lipid vesicles in a 1:20 peptide to lipid ratio with a final peptide concentration of 1 μM. Dye release was measured at pH 6.0 (A) and pH 7.0 (B). Vesicles were composed of PG (∘), PC (▴), mixed gangliosides (“), GM1 (♦), or asialo-GM1 (▵). Mellitin was used as a positive control for membrane disruption at both pH values (□). Data points were collected continuously at a rate of one point every 5 s, and the symbols are used to differentiate the curves. S.D. were calculated from at least five experiments for each lipid system.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although the physiological concentration of Aβ is not strictly known, it is present under normal conditions in the cerebrospinal fluid at 0.5 nM and in cell culture at 1 nM concentrations (23Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Esch F. Lee M. Dovey H. Davis D. Sinha S. Schlossmacher M. Whaley J. Swindlehurst C. McCormack R. Wolfert R. Selkoe D. Lieberburg I. Schenk D. Nature. 1992; 359: 268-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). Decreasing the concentration of peptide decreases the percentage dye release from acidic phospholipid vesicles. Our data, at 100 nM concentrations, indicate that Aβ40 is still able to release dye from PG vesicles above the 40% TFE control (Fig. 3). Aβ42 is unable to induce dye leakage at these low concentrations. To locate the region of Aβ40/42 which is responsible for disrupting membranes, we examined the Aβ fragments, Aβ9-25 and Aβ25-35; neither fragment disrupted PG nor PC vesicles (Fig. 1, A and B; Table I). These results imply that at low micromolar concentrations the entire Aβ40/42 sequence is required to disrupt phospholipid membranes and allow passage of dye. In addition, these peptides serve as negative controls for the dye release assay (Table I). Gangliosides are sialic acid containing glycosphingolipids that are important in biosignaling and memory function. Recently, a ganglioside-bound form of Aβ was isolated from AD brain (19Yanagisawa K. Odaka A. Suzuki N. Ihara Y. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1062-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Pure gangliosides do not form stable vesicles, and they are commonly mixed with PC for vesicle studies. We have examined the ability of Aβ40 (Fig. 1) and Aβ42 (Fig. 2) to disrupt vesicles composed of a 1:1 mixture (by weight) of PC and gangliosides from bovine brain. We have shown above that neither Aβ40 (Fig. 1) nor Aβ42 (Fig. 2) interacts with PC vesicles at pH 6.0 or 7.0; consequently, any effects observed with mixed ganglioside/PC vesicles must result from Aβ-ganglioside interactions alone. Of all the lipid vesicles tested here, the greatest disrupting activity was seen when either Aβ40 (Fig. 1C) or Aβ42 (Fig. 2A) was added to mixed ganglioside/PC vesicles at pH 6.0. In addition, the percent dye release, 90%, of Aβ40/42 from mixed ganglioside/PC vesicles at pH 6.0 approached that of bee venom mellitin (Fig. 1, Fig. 2B). At pH 7.0, on the other hand, Aβ40 released 48% dye from mixed ganglioside-containing vesicles (Fig. 1D), whereas Aβ42 possessed no activity (Fig. 2B). We examined the specificity of the ganglioside-disrupting activity of Aβ40 and Aβ42 using monosialoganglioside GM1 (the major component of brain mixed gangliosides) and asialoganglioside. At pH 6.0, GM1/PC dye release was less than that observed with mixed ganglioside/PC vesicles for both Aβ40 (Fig. 1C) and Aβ42 (Fig. 2A), 35 and 26%, respectively. At pH 7.0, Aβ40 released approximately 23% of the encapsulated dye from GM1/PC vesicles (Fig. 1D), whereas Aβ42 was inactive (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that GM1 alone cannot account for the total disrupting activity observed with mixed gangliosides. Aβ40 disrupted asialo-GM1/PC vesicles at pH 6.0 only marginally and was inactive at pH 7.0 (Fig. 1). Aβ42 was inactive at both pH 6.0 and pH 7.0 (Fig. 2). Thus, sialic acid appears to be critical for Aβ-ganglioside disruption. The differences in the ability of Aβ40/42 to release dye from acidic phospholipids versus acidic gangliosides may involve the presence of the complex sugar moieties that are part of the ganglioside headgroup. Neither Aβ9-25 nor Aβ25-35 disrupted mixed ganglioside/PC vesicles (Fig. 1, C and D; Table I). Thus, as found with Aβ-phospholipid interactions, it appears that the entire Aβ40/42 sequence is also required for disruption of ganglioside membranes. The dye release curves in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 plateau before reaching 100% dye release. This may be the result of multiple vesicle types present in our system, one of which is accessible to Aβ40/42 disruption and another which is inaccessible. Alternatively, Aβ40/42 may have a strong interaction with a limited number of lipid molecules where it becomes “trapped,” thereby leaving a number of vesicles untouched. To investigate this, the dependence of dye release from lipid vesicles on peptide concentration was examined using Aβ40/42 and PG vesicles as a model for acidic phospholipids. Increasing concentrations of Aβ40/42 resulted in a monotonic increase in dye release. The addition of 5 μM Aβ40 induces virtually 100% dye release from the PG vesicles at pH 6.0 (Fig. 3A). Aβ42, on the other hand, did not reach 100% dye release even at 5 μM concentration at pH 6.0. Thus under the conditions tested, the entire intravesicular pool of dye is susceptible to release by Aβ40 but not by Aβ42. The dye release curves for GM1/PC vesicles demonstrate a lower and more pronounced plateau at pH 7.0; the effect of increasing peptide concentrations was also investigated in this system. Increasing concentrations of Aβ40 produced a monotonic increase in the percent dye release from GM1/PC vesicles; at the highest concentration tested, 10 μM, the percent dye released was 45% (Fig. 3B). Aβ42 was unable to induce dye release from GM1/PC vesicles even at 10 μM concentrations. The concentration dependence of Aβ40/42-induced dye release suggests that when Aβ peptides are added at low concentrations to dye-loaded vesicles, they bind and disrupt the lipid vesicle; however, after disruption they remain associated with the vesicle and are unavailable for further disruption. Mellitin, on the other hand, induces 100% dye release at 5.8 nM concentrations for all lipid systems tested. The ability of mellitin to induce dye release has been well characterized and has been shown to be dependent on both peptide concentration and lipid composition (21Kempf C. Klausner R.D. Weinstein J.N. Van Renswoude J. Pincus M. Blumenthal R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2469-2476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results provide evidence that the differences in Aβ40/42 induced dye release caused by specific peptide-lipid interactions rather than variability in the vesicle types present in the different preparations. The above studies indicate that Aβ40/42 possess a pH-dependent membrane-disrupting activity that is specific for acidic phospholipids. To determine whether there is a structural basis for this activity, we analyzed Aβ40 (Fig. 4) and Aβ42 (Fig. 5) in the presence of various phospholipid vesicles by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. While CD measurements were performed on peptide-lipid suspensions, control measurements using pure lipid suspensions were used to eliminate the contribution of the lipids to the total CD signal. Thus the data in Fig. 4, Fig. 5 represent the CD signal originating from the peptides only. Aβ40/42 were stored in 40% TFE, under these conditions their CD spectra exhibited a strong minima at 208 nm and a weaker minima at 222 nm (Figs. 4A and 5A). These spectra are indicative of partially α-helical structures (24Chen Y.-H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar) and are consistent with previous NMR studies on Aβ40 in TFE (22Barrow C.J. Zagorski M.G. Science. 1991; 253: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Upon dilution into PBS at pH 6.0 or 7.0, both Aβ40 (Fig. 4A) and Aβ42 (Fig. 5A) became unstructured. In the presence of PG vesicles at pH 6.0, however, Aβ40/42 both possessed a strong CD minima at 218 nm which is indicative of β-structure (Figs. 4B and 5B). At pH 7.0, the extent of β-structure formation was reduced (Figs. 4B and 5B). Unlike the effects seen with PG vesicles, Aβ40/42 remained unstructured in the presence of PC vesicles (Figs. 4C and 5C).Fig. 5Secondary structure determination of Aβ42 in the presence or absence of various lipids using circular dichroism. Lipids were present at a 1:20 peptide to lipid ratio with a final peptide concentration of 10 μM. CD spectra of Aβ42 in PBS pH 6.0 (dotted line), PBS pH 7.0 (dashed line), and 40% TFE (dashed, dotted line) are shown in A. CD spectra of Aβ42 in the presence of PG (B), PC (C), mixed gangliosides (D), GM1 (E), and asialo-GM1 (F) at both pH 6.0 (dotted line) and pH 7.0 (dashed line).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Combining the results of the dye release assay with the CD data, a structure-function relationship emerges. Aβ appears to be unstructured in aqueous solutions at low micromolar concentrations. However, if acidic phospholipids are present and the pH is slightly acidic, Aβ disrupts with the bilayer in a β-structured conformation. At pH 7.0, Aβ40/42 disrupted ganglioside vesicles to a greater extent than phospholipid vesicles (Fig. 1, Fig. 2), thus the structure-function relationship in the presence of ganglioside vesicles might differ from that in the presence of phospholipid vesicles. To investigate these possible differences, we examined the secondary structure of Aβ40 (Fig. 4) and Aβ42 (Fig. 5) in the presence of ganglioside/PC vesicles. As with the phospholipid studies, the contributions of the gangliosides were removed from the CD data. Similar to that seen for phospholipids at pH 6.0, mixed ganglioside/PC vesicles induced significant β-structure for Aβ40 (Fig. 4D) and Aβ42 (Fig. 5D). At pH 7.0, on the other hand, the CD spectra of both Aβ40 (Fig. 4D) and Aβ42 (Fig. 5D) exhibited a strong CD minimum at 220 nm and a weaker one at 208 nm; these spectra are suggestive of a novel α/β conformation (24Chen Y.-H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). Deconvolution of these spectra using the method of Yang et al. (25Yang J.T. Wu C.-S.C. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar) yielded the following results: Aβ40 was comprised of 10%α-helix, 16%β-sheet, and 74% non-α/β structure; Aβ42 contained a higher percentage of β-sheet structure, 20%, and a concomitant decrease in α-helix content, 6%. Similar results were seen for Aβ40 (Fig. 4E) and Aβ42 (Fig. 5E) in the presence of GM1/PC vesicles. Asialo-GM1 (Figs. 4F and 5F) could not induce the unique α/β conformation; therefore, the sialic acid moiety of gangliosides is critical for formation of this structure. The CD spectra of Aβ40/42 in the presence of ganglioside/PC vesicles were significantly different from the spectra in 40% TFE, with respect to the positions and magnitudes of the CD minima. Analysis of the CD spectra of Aβ40/42 in 40% TFE reveals that Aβ40 is 22%α-helical and 78% non-α/β structure, whereas Aβ42 is 16%α-helical. Comparison of the CD spectra of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the presence and absence of TFE reveals an isodichroic point at 201 nm, this is indicative of a mixture of α-helical and random structures only (26Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar). The same analysis of Aβ40/42 in the presence and absence of gangliosides does not reveal this isodichroic point, therefore, indicating the presence of non-α-helical structure (26Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar). Thus, the three-dimensional structure of Aβ40/42 in the presence of gangliosides is different from the structure in 40% TFE. The results with ganglioside-containing vesicles demonstrate that the structure-function relationship of Aβ40/42 exhibits a strong pH de"

These findings implicate caveolae in signal transduction and suggest that many of the molecular components for cell signaling are localized in this relatively small area of the plasma membrane. We have recently shown that in Madin Darby canine kidney cells, a large proportion of the total cellular PtdIns 4,5-P2 1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns 4,5-P2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphatePtdInsphosphatidylinositollyso-PtdInslysophosphatidylinositolPtdInsPphosphatidylinositol monophosphateDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumEGFepidermal growth factorMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. resides in detergent-insoluble lipid domains enriched in caveolin (14Hope H.R. Pike L.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Given this observation, the question arises as to whether the PtdIns 4,5-P2 present in caveolae is subject to turnover in response to growth factors and hormones. We now report that, in A431 cells, at least 50% of the PtdIns 4,5-P2 is present in caveolae, and this pool of phospholipid is reduced in cells treated with EGF or bradykinin. Polyphosphoinositides present in the plasma membrane fraction are not altered by hormone treatment. These findings suggest that PtdIns 4,5-P2 is highly compartmentalized within cells and that caveolae are the primary site of agonist-stimulated PtdIns 4,5-P2 turnover. phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate phosphatidylinositol lysophosphatidylinositol phosphatidylinositol monophosphate Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium epidermal growth factor 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. Anti-caveolin antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-actin antibodies were from Chemicon (El Segundo, CA). The polyclonal anti-EGF receptor antibody, DB1, was described previously (15Schuh S.M. Newberry E.P. Dalton M.A. Pike L.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). myo-[3H]Inositol and the Enhanced Chemiluminescence kit were from Amersham. EN3HANCE was from DuPont NEN. EGF was prepared by the method of Savage and Cohen (16Savage R.C. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7609-7611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other chemicals were from Sigma. A431 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 7% newborn calf serum and 3% fetal calf serum. A431 cells were plated in 150-mm dishes, and, 24 h later, cultures were labeled with 50 μCi of myo-[3H]inositol in DMEM:inositol-free DMEM (1:1) containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. Cells were grown in labeling media for 48 h at which time the cultures were confluent. For hormone stimulation, EGF or bradykinin was added directly to the culture medium at final concentrations of 50 nM or 10 μM, respectively. Incubations were for 5 min at 37°C. Monolayers were washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 25 mM MES, pH 6.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM benzamidine, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were incubated for 10 min on ice with frequent agitation. One ml of lysate was mixed with 1 ml of 25 mM MES, pH 6.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA containing 80% sucrose by passing the sample through a 22-gauge needle five times. Six ml of 25 mM MES, pH 6.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 30% sucrose, and, subsequently, 4 ml of 25 mM MES, pH 6.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 5% sucrose were layered on top of the sample. The tubes were centrifuged for 3 h at 4°C at 175,000 × g in an SW41 rotor. Fractions of 1.2 ml were collected beginning from the top of the gradient. The pellet was resuspended in 1.2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Aliquots (800 μl) of each fraction were removed, extracted with chloroform/methanol, and analyzed by thin layer chromatography on silica plates as described previously (14Hope H.R. Pike L.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Following autoradiography, bands corresponding to PtdIns, lyso-PtdIns, PtdInsP, and PtdIns 4,5-P2 were identified by co-migration with standards, scraped from the plates, and counted for 3H. For analysis of phosphoinositide turnover, A431 cells were plated in 6-well dishes and labeled for 48 h with myo-[3H]inositol as described above. Cultures were preincubated for 30 min at 37°C with 10 mM LiCl and subsequently incubated with vehicle, 50 nM EGF, or 10 μM bradykinin for the times indicated. [3H]Inositol phosphates were isolated on Dowex columns as described previously (17Downes C.P. Michell R.H. Biochem. J. 1981; 198: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). A431 cells in D60 plates were labeled for 2 days in myo-[3H]inositol to ∼50% confluence. Cells were treated with 50 nM EGF or 10 μM bradykinin by direct addition of the hormone to the labeling medium. After the indicated period of time at 37°C, the plates were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Three ml of Triton extraction buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 250 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100) were added to each plate which was then incubated for 10 min on ice with gentle rocking. At the end of the extraction, the Triton-soluble supernatant was collected and 3 ml of stop solution (methanol:concentrated HCl, 10:1) were added to the sample. The plates containing the Triton-insoluble material were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and the residual cell material was scraped into 1 ml of stop solution. Lipids were extracted and analyzed as outlined above. Aliquots of 50 μl of each fraction were separated on either a 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel or a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blotting for caveolin, actin, and EGF receptors was carried out as by Hope and Pike (14Hope H.R. Pike L.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the precipitation Lowry method (18Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7141) Google Scholar). A431 cells were subjected to extraction in Triton X-100 followed by analysis of the lysates by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Caveolae have been shown to be resistant to extraction in Triton X-100 and are separable from bulk cellular lipids and proteins by density gradient centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 1A, relatively little protein was found in the upper, low density fractions of the sucrose gradient. However, the vast majority of caveolin, the protein marker for caveolae, appeared in fraction 4 (Fig. 1B), a position corresponding to the interface between the 5% and 30% sucrose layers. A low and variable amount of caveolin was associated with the pellet fraction and is probably due to the association of caveolae with cytoskeletal elements or the presence of some unbroken cells. These findings identify fraction 4 as the fraction containing caveolae. The bulk of the cellular protein was present in fractions 9, 10, and the pellet. Fractions 9 and 10 correspond to the position of the original lysate (mixed with sucrose) at the bottom of the gradient and would be expected to contain cytosolic proteins as well as any membrane proteins or lipids that were solubilized by treatment with Triton X-100. To substantiate this assignment, the gradient fractions were analyzed for the presence of actin, a cytosolic/cytoskeletal protein, and the EGF receptor, an integral membrane protein. Although some actin and some EGF receptor were found in the fraction enriched in caveolin, the bulk of both proteins appeared in fractions 9 and 10. These results confirm the conclusion that fractions 9 and 10 contain both soluble cytosolic proteins as well as detergent-solubilized integral membrane proteins. Fig. 1, C through F show the distribution of various phosphoinositides in this same gradient. Relatively little PtdIns or lyso-PtdIns was present in the low density, caveolin-enriched fraction. The majority of these lipids was present in fractions 9 and 10 indicating that PtdIns and lyso-PtdIns fractionate primarily with solubilized membrane protein. By contrast, both PtdInsP and PtdInsP2 were well-represented in the caveolar fraction. Approximately half of the total PtdInsP2 recovered in the gradient was present in fraction 4. An additional ∼15% of the PtdInsP2 fractionated with the plasma membrane in fractions 9 and 10. On average, 52 ± 5% of the PtdInsP2 appeared in fraction 4 and 13 ± 7% in fractions 9 and 10 (n = 5). The distribution of PtdInsP was similar to that of PtdInsP2, although roughly equal amounts of PtdInsP were found in the caveolar fraction and the original lysate layer (fractions 9 and 10). Both the initial lysate and the sucrose gradient buffers contained EGTA to inhibit metabolism of the phosphoinositides by phospholipase C during preparation of the subcellular fractions. To determine whether the lipid profiles observed in the sucrose gradients were representative of the levels of lipids initially present in the cellular lysate, the total amount of PtdIns, lyso-PtdIns, PtdInsP, or PtdInsP2 recovered in the gradient was compared to the amount of that lipid present in an aliquot of the original lysate. Recoveries of PtdIns, lyso-PtdIns, and PtdInsP2 were found to range from 80 to 100% (n = 5) with no consistent loss among any of the lipids. Occasionally, greater than 100% recovery of lyso-PtdIns was observed suggesting that this lipid was being generated during sample preparation, presumably due to the activity of a phospholipase A2. By contrast, recovery of PtdInsP was always approximately 20%. These results indicate that inclusion of the chelating agent largely prevented the metabolism of PtdIns, lyso-PtdIns, and PtdInsP2 but did not block the breakdown of PtdInsP. Thus, the observed distribution of PtdInsP may not accurately reflect the cellular distribution of this lipid. In cells, the effects of EGF are mediated by the EGF receptor, a member of the tyrosine kinase family of growth factor receptors. Bradykinin stimulates biological responses via a seven transmembrane domain, G protein-coupled receptor. Treatment of A431 cells with either EGF or bradykinin resulted in a time-dependent increase in the production of inositol phosphates (Fig. 2). EGF stimulated a 2-fold increase and bradykinin a 3-fold increase in inositol phosphate production. These results indicate that, in A431 cells, PtdIns turnover can be stimulated either through a receptor tyrosine kinase or a G protein-coupled receptor. To determine the subcellular location of the PtdInsP2 that is hydrolyzed in response to hormones, A431 cells were labeled with [3H]inositol for 48 h and subsequently treated with vehicle, EGF, or bradykinin for 5 min at 37°C. The cells were then solubilized in Triton X-100 and subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Fig. 3, A and B, shows the distribution of PtdIns and PtdInsP2 in these gradients. The results are presented as the total counts of each inositol phospholipid recovered in the fractions. C and D compare the levels of PtdIns and PtdInsP2 present in fraction 4 (the caveolar fraction), fractions 9 + 10 (the cytosolic/solubilized plasma membrane fraction), or the pellet (cytoskeletal fraction) after normalization to the protein present in the control sample from each fraction. Neither EGF nor bradykinin induced a significant change in the level of PtdIns or lyso-PtdIns in any of the subcellular fractions. By contrast, both hormones promoted a substantial decrease in the PtdInsP2 present in the caveolar fraction. Surprisingly, neither hormone appeared to induce a loss of PtdInsP2 from the solubilized plasma membrane fraction (fractions 9 + 10). In four separate experiments, EGF induced an average decrease of 47% in PtdInsP2 in fraction 4 with a range of 30% to 60% (p < 0.05, paired t test). In the same experiments, bradykinin also stimulated an average decrease of 47% with a range of 40% to 50% (p < 0.01, paired t test). The decline in PtdInsP2 levels seen in the presence of agonist cannot be attributed to decreased recovery of this lipid as analyses indicated 80%, 92%, and 100% recovery of PtdInsP2 in the gradients derived from control, EGF-, and bradykinin-treated cells, respectively. In addition, treatment with hormones did not alter the distribution of protein, caveolin, actin, or EGF receptor in the gradients (not shown). Because the use of sucrose gradients to separate caveolar lipids does not permit the simultaneous analysis of large numbers of samples, an alternate method of sample preparation was devised to permit further characterization of the effect of hormones on phosphoinositide levels in the caveolin-enriched fraction. This involved incubation of cell monolayers with Triton X-100-containing buffers on ice for 10 min followed by the recovery and analysis of lipids in the Triton-soluble supernatant and the Triton-insoluble pellet. As shown in Fig. 4A, extraction of unstimulated cell monolayers with Triton-containing buffer resulted in the release of approximately 50% of the total PtdInsP2 into the Triton-soluble supernatant with the retention of ∼50% of this lipid in the Triton-insoluble pellet. This compares favorably with the observed distribution of PtdInsP2 between Triton-soluble and Triton-insoluble fractions isolated by sucrose gradients. Under these same conditions, only 3% of the PtdIns and 6% of the lyso-PtdIns were retained in the pellet. Approximately 20% of the PtdInsP remained in the Triton-insoluble pellet. The inset in panel A shows a Western blot for caveolin in total cell lysate as well as the Triton-soluble and Triton-insoluble fractions. The data demonstrate that essentially all of the caveolin was retained in the Triton-insoluble pellet. Thus, the distribution of caveolin and phosphoinositides in the Triton-insoluble fraction mirrors the distribution of these components in the low density, Triton-resistant fraction from the sucrose density gradients. Using this procedure, the time course of EGF- and bradykinin-stimulated PtdInsP2 turnover was examined. The data in Fig. 4B demonstrate that both EGF and bradykinin stimulated a time-dependent loss of PtdInsP2 from the Triton-insoluble pellet. The level of PtdInsP2 in the Triton-soluble supernatant (total minus Triton-insoluble) remained essentially constant throughout the time course, indicating that the loss of PtdInsP2 was principally from the Triton-insoluble compartment. The results presented in this report reveal two important features of the biology of cellular PtdInsP2. First, PtdInsP2 appears to be largely compartmentalized within A431 cells. At least half of this polyphosphoinositide is contained within a low density, detergent-resistant, caveolin-enriched fraction that almost certainly corresponds to caveolae. Less than 20% of the PtdInsP2 fractionated with plasma membrane components. The phosphoinositides are not uniformly concentrated in caveolae as these domains contain only about 10% of the cellular PtdIns and lyso-PtdIns. Nonetheless, the fact that, in most cells, caveolae represent less than 1% of the plasma membrane, indicates that even PtdIns and lyso-PtdIns are highly enriched in these domains. In addition, the higher abundance of PtdIns in cells as compared to PtdInsP2 means that in absolute terms there is more PtdIns than PtdInsP2 in caveolae. Our results suggest that these domains contain an order of magnitude more PtdIns than PtdInsP2. Caveolin has been shown to cycle between the Golgi, the plasma membrane, and the endoplasmic reticulum (19Conrad P.A. Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Anderson R.G.W. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1421-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Since the endoplasmic reticulum is the site of PtdIns synthesis, the high levels of PtdIns in caveolae may be derived from this source. As such, caveolae may play a role in the transport of PtdIns from its site of synthesis in the ER to the plasma membrane where it is presumably phosphorylated and used for signaling. The second important observation is that the PtdInsP2 localized to the caveolae appears to turn over in response to EGF and bradykinin. No consistent decrease in PtdInsP2 levels was observed in any other gradient fraction suggesting that caveolae are the primary site of PtdInsP2 hydrolysis. The time course of PIP2 turnover in the caveolar fraction was consistent with the rate of hormone-stimulated inositol phosphate production observed in these studies as well as in previous work (20Wahl M.I. Sweatt J.D. Carpenter G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 688-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Tilly B.C. Van Paridon P.A. Verlaan I. de Laat S.W. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem.

Similar to other reports (23Augert G. Blackmore P.F. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

The observation that both EGF and bradykinin stimulated PtdInsP2 turnover in caveolae indicates that pathways involving the activation of phospholipase Cγ via tyrosine kinases and the activation of phospholipase Cβ by G protein-coupled receptors converge in caveolae and lead to the turnover of lipids in this compartment. The finding that EGF and bradykinin-stimulate PtdInsP2 turnover in caveolae is consistent with reports that G protein-coupled receptors (24Chun M. Liyanage U.K. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl.

In our studies, EGF receptors were definitely present in the caveolar fraction; however, they represented only a small proportion of the total cellular EGF receptors. This may be due to the fact that A431 cells possess an extraordinarily high number of EGF receptors (1-3 × 106/cell) and their number may exceed the capacity of the caveolae. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the detergent extraction method for isolating caveolae used in our studies and the detergent-free procedure used by Mineo et al. (12Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) lead to the different recoveries of EGF receptors in this fraction. Previous experiments in a variety of cell types have indicated the presence of metabolically distinct pools of inositol phospholipids. In many cases, the pools have been identified as being hormone-responsive or hormone-unresponsive (reviewed in 25Monaco M.E. Gershengorn M.C. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 707-718PubMed Google Scholar). The findings reported herein provide a framework for understanding this body of work. The data suggest that metabolic compartmentalization of PtdInsP2 may result from the sequestration of a portion of this lipid in caveolae which is then subject to hormone-stimulated hydrolysis. The remaining PtdInsP2, present within the plasma membrane and perhaps other cellular membranes, would appear to comprise the hormone-unresponsive pool of this polyphosphoinositide. Our findings document the physical compartmentalization and turnover of PtdInsP2 in caveolae. The observation that the inositol trisphosphate receptor is also concentrated in this domain (26Fujimoto T. Nakade S. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Ogawa K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1507-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) indicates that both the production of and response to InsP3 is highly compartmentalized within cells. This suggests that the localization of signaling is an important aspect of intracellular communication."

We have cloned the 5′-flanking region of the gene encoding human SREBP-2. Characterization of this region shows the minimum 50-base pair segment, which contains a 10-base pair sterol regulatory element 1 (SRE-1) identical to the one in the human LDL receptor promoter, confers sterol responsiveness when fused to the luciferase reporter gene. Enforced expression of the truncated SREBP-2 protein (amino acid residues 1-481) also shows that this upstream segment contains the information required for transcriptional activation. The luciferase assays using mutant versions of the reporter genes reveal that the sterol-dependent transcriptional regulation is mediated by two nearby motifs, the SRE-1 and the NF-Y binding site (the inverted CCAAT box, ATTGGC); the latter is reported to play a critical role in sterol-dependent regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase and farnesyl diphosphate synthase genes (Jackson, S.

In this study the site-specificity of the mature cross-links in human bone collagen was examined. Peptides containing fluorescent pyridinoline cross-links and Ehrlich's-reactive pyrrole cross-links were isolated from a bacterial collagenase digest of demineralized bone matrix. The digest was fractionated by molecular sieve chromatography, monitoring for peptide absorbance, pyridinoline fluorescence, pyrroles by Ehrlich's reagent, and immunoassay for cross-linked N-telopeptides. Individual cross-linked peptides were resolved by ion-exchange and reverse-phase HPLC. Structures were established by NH2-terminal microsequencing, cross-link analysis, electrospray mass spectrometry, and immunoassay. Two, about equally occupied, sites of pyridinoline cross-linking were identified, N-telopeptide to helix and C-telopeptide to helix. Pyrroles were alternative cross-linking products at the same sites, but concentrated (85%) at the N-telopeptide end. Only one combination of chains was cross-linked by pyridinolines at the C-telopeptide to helix site, [α1(I)C]2α1(I)helix. Several peptide combinations arose from the N-telopeptide to helix site, but the main source of pyridinolines was from the locus, α1(I)Nα2(I)Nα1(I)helix. Pyridinolines linking two α1N telopeptides were a minor component. Pyrroles were concentrated at the locus, α1(I)Nα2(I)Nα2(I)helix. The cross-link ratio of hydroxylysylpyridinoline to lysylpyridinoline differed between N-telopeptide and C-telopeptide sites, and between the individual interchain combinations. Cross-linked N-telopeptides accounted for two-thirds of the total lysylpyridinoline in bone.

The chemistry of lysine-mediated intermolecular cross-linking in the fibrillar collagens is understood in some detail (1Tanzer M.L.

The three principal collagens, types I, II, and III, have four cross-linking sites at equivalent locations in their molecules, one in each telopeptide and two others at sites in the triple-helical domains at or close to residues 87 and 930. The initial intermolecular cross-links in new fibrils are borohydride-reducible residues that are condensation products between aldehyde side chains formed on the telopeptides by lysyl oxidase, and hydroxylysine or lysine residues in helical domains of adjacent molecules. Both N-telopeptide-to-helix and C-telopeptide-to-helix cross-links occur (5Kang A.H. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 1828-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 6Miller E.J. Robertson P.B. Biochem.

HP is widely distributed in the collagens of most internal, vertebrate connective tissues, whereas LP, although widely distributed, features most prominently in bone and dentin. The pattern of cross-linking in bone collagen is also strikingly different from that of soft tissue collagens in other respects, including retention of a significant pool of the borohydride-reducible, initial cross-links throughout adult life (4Eyre D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 115-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The distinctive pattern of cross-linking interactions in bone collagen may be a result of or, as proposed, a necessary requirement for its mineralization (11Yamauchi M. Katz E.P. Mechanic G.L.

In recent years, the pyridinoline residues HP and LP have become widely adopted in clinical studies as urinary markers of bone resorption. The molecular sites of origin of HP and LP in human bone collagen are, therefore, important to define. Pyridinoline residues have been proposed to form by a condensation reaction between two divalent keto-amine cross-links (17Eyre D.R. Oguchi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 92: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), with the resulting structure effectively incorporating one divalent cross-link and one hydroxylysine aldehyde (18Robins S.P. Duncan A. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The pyridinoline residue, therefore, links three collagen α-chains, two telopeptide and one helical domain, each in a separate collagen molecule (17Eyre D.R. Oguchi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 92: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 18Robins S.P. Duncan A. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 19Hanson D.A. Weis M.A.E.

Thus, in the homotrimeric type II collagen of bovine articular cartilage, there are only two molecular sites of pyridinoline cross-linking, between the same residues that initially formed borohydride-reducible cross-links in the immature collagen (18Robins S.P. Duncan A. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Wu J.-J. Eyre D.R. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1850-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Reports on type I collagen of bone, dentin, and tendon, however, present inconsistent results on the molecular sites of the pyridinolines, with respect to the α-chains involved and the functional importance of these residues in stabilizing the collagen fibrils (10Kuboki Y.

They proposed (29Kuypers R. Tyler M. Kurth L.B. Jenkins I.D. Horgan D.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) that the Ehrlich's chromogen was a tri-substituted pyrrole that was formed from ketoamine and aldimine cross-links in an analogous fashion to pyridinoline cross-link formation, except that one aldehyde donor came from a telopeptide lysine and the other from a telopeptide hydroxylysine, rather than from two hydroxylysine aldehydes. A recent report concluded that pyrrole cross-links were as abundant as pyridinolines in human bone collagen (31Risteli J. Eriksen H. Risteli L. Mansell J.P. Bailey A.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9 (Suppl. 1): S186Google Scholar). In the present study, the interpeptide sites of mature cross-links in human bone collagen were sought. The approach was to resolve peptides chromatographically from a bacterial collagenase digest of the mature tissue protein. Pyridinoline-containing and Ehrlich's chromogen-reactive peptides were traced by their respective fluorescence and p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde reactivity. Isolated peptides were structurally identified by NH2-terminal sequencing, pyridinoline cross-link analysis, electrospray mass spectrometry, and immunoreactivity with a monoclonal antibody specific to collagen type I cross-linked N-telopeptides (19Hanson D.A.

Human cortical bone (male, aged 25 years, banked tissue, Northwest Tissue Center, Seattle, WA) was excised from the mid-shaft of the femur, washed at 4°C in phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM benzamidine) and defatted at 4°C with methanol/chloroform (1:3, v/v). Bone was then manually splintered, desiccated, and powdered under liquid N2 in a SPEX mill (SPEX Industries). Bone powder was demineralized at 4°C with two changes of excess 0.5 M EDTA, 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, over 2 weeks. The demineralized bone powder was washed thoroughly with cold distilled H2O, lyophilized, and stored at −20°C before use. Demineralized bone matrix was suspended in 0.1 M CaCl2, 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.001% (w/v) thiomersalate at 10 mg/ml, heated to 70°C in hot water bath for 10 min, transferred to a 37°C water bath, and allowed to equilibrate. Crude bacterial collagenase (Sigma type 1a, from Clostridium histolyticum) was added (1:50, enzyme:substrate, w/w) and digestion allowed to proceed for 24 h. Digests were acidified to 1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and loaded onto a preconditioned C-18 reverse-phase Sep-Pak (Millipore). The cartridge was washed with 5% (v/v) acetonitrile, and bound peptides were eluted with 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, and freeze-dried. The freeze-dried digest was dissolved in 10% (v/v) acetic acid, and the supernatant applied to a Bio-Gel P-10 (200-400 mesh, Bio-Rad) column (2.5 × 90 cm or 1.5 × 100 cm) and eluted with 10% (v/v) acetic acid at a flow rate of 10 ml/h. Fractions (2.5 ml) were collected and read for absorbance (280 nm) and fluorescence (excitation, 297 nm and emission, 395 nm). Aliquots of column fractions were assayed for Ehrlich's chromogen reactivity. Aliquots from serial fractions of chromatographic runs were brought up to 0.75 ml with distilled H2O and reacted with 0.125 ml of 5% (w/v) p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in 4 M HCl04 (25Scott J.E.

Peptide samples to be hydrolyzed were dried in new glass Kimax tubes with screw tops on a rotary evaporation unit. One ml of 6 N HCl (Sigma Ultrex) was added to each tube, capped with Teflon-lined screw top, and hydrolyzed for 24 h at 110°C. After hydrolysis, samples were dried and dissolved in 1% (v/v) n-heptafluorobutyric acid (Pierce sequanal grade) and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC as described (4Eyre D.R.

Lyophilized pools of P-10 fractions were chromatographed on a Bio-Gel DEAE-5PW column (7.5 × 75 mm, Bio-Rad) using a Rainin two-pump system, collecting 1-min fractions. The two buffers were identical in composition, 0.02 M Tris-HCl in 10% (v/v) acetonitrile, pH 7.5, except buffer B contained 0.5 M NaCl. The initial column conditions were 2% buffer B at 1.0 ml/min. Samples were dissolved in buffer A and eluted using a two-stage gradient: buffer B held at 2% for the first 2 min then increasing linearly to 40% over the next 28 min. Effluent was monitored for UV absorbance (220 nm) and for fluorescence (excitation, 330 nm; emission, 395 nm) (4Eyre D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 115-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Lyophilized pools of DEAE-5PW fractions were fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC on an Aquapore RP-300 column (C8, 5 μm beads, 4.6 mm × 25 cm, Brownlee Labs) using a Rainin two-pump system. Samples were dissolved in 1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and eluted using a linear gradient (usually 0-45%) of acetonitrile/1-propanol (3:1, v/v) in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Effluent was monitored for UV absorbance (220 nm) and fluorescence (excitation, 297 nm; emission, 395 nm) (4Eyre D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 115-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). One-min fractions were collected and those corresponding to fluorescent peaks were pooled for analysis. Immunoassay of cross-linked α2(I) N-telopeptide was essentially performed as described previously (19Hanson D.A. Weis M.A.E. Bollen A-M. Maslan S.L. Singer F.R. Eyre D.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 1251-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Briefly, dried samples were dissolved in 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 μl was applied directly to a well of a previously prepared antigen plate. After all wells of the plate contained either sample, dilutions of a standard, or buffer, 100 μl/well of appropriately diluted 1H11 ascites was quickly added. After 1 h at room temperature, the plate was washed with 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma), and patted dry. Bound mAb 1H11 was determined by sequential addition of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), wash buffer, and TMB substrate solution (0.1 mg/ml tetramethylbenzidine in 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, containing 0.01% (w/v) H2O2). Color reaction was stopped with 1.5 N H2SO4 and absorbance was read at 450 nm using a Titertek Multiskan PLUS plate reader. Relative immunoreactivity values for samples were calculated from a semi-log plot of the relative concentration of a standard versus absorbance. A Porton model 2090E instrument with on-line reverse-phase HPLC detection of phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives was used to obtain NH2-terminal sequence data from the enriched cross-linked peptides. Individual purified peptides were structurally identified from their molecular masses deduced from their ions on electrospray mass spectrometry using a triple quadrupole instrument (Sciex Model API III). Fig. 1 shows the UV absorbance and fluorescence profiles of a collagenase digest of human bone collagen fractionated by molecular sieve chromatography. Two prominent fluorescent peptide peaks, labeled A and C, with a shoulder labeled B in between, were recovered, eluting between the void volume (∼60 ml) and total bed volume (∼200 ml) of the column. Most (85%) of the Ehrlich's chromogen (pyrrole) reactivity, with a peak of absorbance at 572 nm, coeluted with fluorescent peak C. Peak C was also shown previously to be the major source of reactivity to mAb 1H11, an antibody which specifically recognizes cross-linked type I collagen N-telopeptides that contain a cleaved 8-amino acid α2(I) N-telopeptide sequence, cross-linked in a ternary peptide complex (19Hanson D.A. Weis M.A.E. Bollen A-M. Maslan S.L. Singer F.R. Eyre D.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 1251-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Fractions corresponding to pools A, B, and C (Fig. 1) were combined and freeze-dried for further analysis. (The peak of Ehrlich's reactivity evident at about 220 ml was of low molecular weight and did not behave as a cross-linked collagen peptide.) Table I shows the results of pyridinoline cross-link analysis by HPLC for the three major pools fractionated by molecular sieve chromatography. Two points emerge. First, total pyridinolines are about equally distributed between N-telopeptide and C-telopeptide sites. Monitoring fluorescence alone (Fig. 1) can underestimate the N-telopeptide contribution because of fluorescence quenching, observed also for cross-linked N-telopeptides from urine (36Eyre D.R. Acta Orthop. Scand. 1995; 66: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The tyrosine residues in the N-telopeptides may be responsible for the quenching. Dilution in organic solvent can unmask the quenched fluorescence (36Eyre D.R. Acta Orthop. Scand. 1995; 66: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Second, two-thirds of the LP is at the N-telopeptide site and one-third at the C-telopeptide site. The HP/LP ratio of the cross-linked N-telopeptide pool from the bone digest is similar to that of the pool immunopurified from human adolescent urine using mAb 1H11 (19Hanson D.A. Weis M.A.E.

Pool A gave a series of fluorescent, pyridinoline-containing peaks (Fig. 2A). Pool B gave one main and one smaller fluorescent peak (1 and 2 in Fig. 2B). Pool C gave two main fluorescent peaks (3 and 4 in Fig. 2C), collected as shown by the bars. Also shown in Fig. 2C is the profile of pyrrole reactivity by p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde reagent given by pool C. Individual peptides were resolved by reverse-phase HPLC. Purified pyridinoline based cross-linked peptides were characterized by HP and LP analysis, reactivity with mAb 1H11, direct NH2-terminal sequencing, and electrospray mass spectrometry. Fig. 3 shows the reverse-phase HPLC elution profile for fraction 15 from Fig. 2A and the structure of the isolated peptide determined by sequence analysis and mass spectrometry. All flanking fluorescent subcomponents in Fig. 2A gave very similar elution profiles with essentially one peak in this same region of the chromatogram (not shown). All contained primarily HP, were not mAb 1H11 reactive, and gave two running sequences. The dominant one was of the α1(I) C-telopeptide (32Bernard M.P. Chu M.-L. Myers J.C. Ramirez F. Eikenberry E.F. Prockop D.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5213-5223Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) beginning at phenylalanine. The second sequence was seven residues in length, at about half the molar yield of the C-telopeptide sequence, and came from the α1(I) N-helix cross-linking site at residue 87 (33D'Alessio M. Bernard M. Pretorious P.J. de Wet W. Ramirez F. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The counterpart peptide containing the α2(I) chain cross-linking site at residue 87 (34Kuivaniemi H. Tromp G. Chu M.-L. Prockop D.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was not found in any of the DEAE-5PW column fractions (Fig. 2A). The most prominent cross-linked peptide from this series of peaks (fraction 15, Fig. 2A) was analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry yielding a mass greater by 162 daltons than the mass of the peptide sequences and cross-link alone (Fig. 3). This finding can be explained if a galactose residue is attached to the hydroxyl group on the ring-nitrogen side arm of the hydroxylysyl pyridinoline residue. This is consistent with galactosyl hydroxylysine being the main form of glycoside on human bone collagen (35Pinnell S.R. Fox R. Krane S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 229: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and a prior study which showed a glycosylated ketoamine cross-link in a peptide from this same, α1(I) residue 87 to C-telopeptide, site in bone collagen (7Eyre D.R. Glimcher M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 52: 663-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The different peak fractions seen in Fig. 2A appear to be both post-translational variants (LP, HP, and glycosylated HP) and different proteolytic cleavage products of this same peptide. Based on amino acid compositions (data not shown), the heterogeneity was also due in part to missing tyrosine residues from the COOH termini of the telopeptides. Pools 1 and 2 (Fig. 2B) each gave two main fluorescent peptides on reverse-phase HPLC, labeled a, b, c, and d, respectively (Fig. 4, A and B). Shown in Fig. 4, pool 3 gave one major (e) and one minor (f) fluorescent peak (Fig. 4C) and pool 4 gave a similar pattern with peptides labeled g and h. It was evident in the original chromatograms, however, on aligning the coincidence of UV absorbance and fluorescence for peptides e and g, that the fluorescence of g was sharper and more concentrated in the first half of the UV peak. The second half aligns more with the pyrrole reactivity given by Ehrlich's reagent. This suggested two forms of the same peptide that differed only in their cross-linking residue, later borne out by amino acid compositions, sequencing, and mass spectrometry (see below). Fig. 5 summarizes the mass spectra and predicted structures of peptides a-h resolved from the pool of pyridinoline-cross-linked N-telopeptides. Peptides a-d (from Pool B, Fig. 1) are all slightly larger versions of peptides e-h, explaining their earlier elution on molecular sieve chromatography. They clearly represent less complete proteolysis products from the same molecular site of cross-linking. For each peptide, molecular ions that differ by 16 mass units and represent HP and LP versions, are evident in a similar ratio to that measured directly by analysis of HP and LP after acid hydrolysis (Table II). In addition, a molecular ion 16 mass units greater than that of the predicted HP ion was consistently observed. This we interpret to be the photolysed form of HP produced during UV exposure on chromatography (4Eyre D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 115-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In structures shown with NH2-terminal glutamine residues, the glutamine was present as pyroglutamic acid which blocked NH2-terminal sequencing of that chain component. Deblocking with pyroglutaminase was partially effective with some peptides, helping confirm the identities, and mass spectrometry established the basic structures. From the data, it is not possible to predict which way round the α1(I) and α2(I) N-telopeptides are placed on the pyridinium ring. Interestingly, none of the peptide structures identified had galactose or glucosylgalactose attached based on the mass spectral data, in contrast with the C-telopeptide structures. From the HP/LP ratios of the individual peptides, reported in Table II, lysine α1930 is less hydroxylated than lysine α2933 as evidenced by the consistently lower HP/LP ratio found in peptides recovered from this site.Table IIThe molar ratios of HP to LP determined on isolated cross-linked N-telopeptidesPeptideIntermolecular originHP/LP molar ratioaα1(I)Nα2(I)Nα1(I)9301.6bα1(I)Nα2(I)Nα1(I)9301.3cα1(I)Nα2(I)Nα2(I)9332.8dα1(I)Nα1(I)Nα1(I)9301.8eα1(I)Nα2(I)Nα1(I)9301.7fα1(I)Nα2(I)Nα2(I)9332.5gα1(I)Nα2(I)Nα2(I)9334.6hα1(I)Nα1(I)Nα1(I)9301.9 Open table in a new tab Fig. 6 shows the mass spectrum and an interpreted structure for the pyrrole-containing peptide found in the later portion of peak g (Fig. 4D). The mass spectrum is consistent with a mixture of forms of peptide g that differ only in the mass of the cross-linking residue. We interpret these as the HP and LP containing structures (LP, m/z 1426.1; HP, m/z 1434.1 shown in Fig. 5G), the UV photolysis product of HP (m/z 1441.6) and two additional molecular ions (m/z 1437.1 and 1445.1) that differ from each other by mass 16 and are larger by mass 22 than the HP- and LP-containing ions. The latter two ions can be accounted for by the pyrrole structure shown, if the ring were oxidatively cleaved and two water molecules were added. In order to verify further the origins of the major"

https://openalex.org/W1520247753,"Although there are multiple potential collagen-binding proteins on platelets, the contribution of each to collagen-induced signaling events and platelet activation is unclear. We investigated which early platelet signaling events, if any, could be attributed specifically to the binding of collagen to one of its receptors, the α2β1 integrin. Treatment of platelets with collagen induced a rapid activation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Syk, as measured by an increase in phosphorylation and kinase activity. Collagen also induced the rapid phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2). The phosphorylation of both Syk and PLCγ2, as well as platelet aggregation, was blocked by an anti-α2β1 integrin monoclonal antibody (P1E6), demonstrating that collagen binding to α2β1 is necessary for signaling. Cross-linking of the α2β1 integrin with stimulatory monoclonal antibody against either the β1 or α2 subunit stimulated the phosphorylation of both Syk and PLCγ2. However, antibody stimulation was dependent on co-stimulation of the FcγII receptor (CD32) since specific F(ab′)2 fragments did not induce Syk and PLCγ2 phosphorylation. Thus, these results suggest that occupancy of α2β1 by collagen is necessary, but that a co-receptor, in addition to α2β1, is required for these collagen-induced signaling events. Moreover, the P1E6 antibody did not inhibit all collagen-induced tyrosine phosphorylation events, demonstrating that collagen also induces phosphorylation events that are independent of the α2β1 integrin. In addition to Syk and PLCγ2, we identified the FcγII receptor (FcγRII) as being rapidly phosphorylated in response to collagen stimulation, even in the absence of antibodies. Finally, to determine if Syk activation precedes and directly contributes to the phosphorylation of PLCγ2, platelets were preincubated with the Syk-selective kinase inhibitor, piceatannol. A concentration of piceatannol that inhibited the phosphorylation and kinase activity of Syk, but had no effect on Src kinase activity, blocked the collagen-induced phosphorylation of PLCγ2 and also inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation. Our results begin to delineate a signaling pathway whereby occupancy of the α2β1 integrin is required, but not sufficient, for collagen-induced activation of Syk and the subsequent phosphorylation of PLCγ2.

The expression of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V, which contains 17 exons and spans 155 kilobase pairs, is expressed in a tissue- and cell type-specific manner and is regulated at the level of transcription by multiple promoters (Saito, H., Gu, J., Nishikawa, A., Ihara, Y., Fujii, J., Kohgo, Y., and Taniguchi, N.

To elucidate the mechanism by which the GnT-V gene is expressed in a cell- and tissue-specific manner, cell-restricted expression was analyzed using the 5′-upstream regions of the human GnT-V gene spanning base pairs −2760 to +23 in a human bile duct carcinoma cell line, HuCC-T1. We characterized two cis-acting elements that are potentially important in HuCC-T1 cell-specific expression. The two elements each contain an Ets-1 binding site, 5′-GGA-3′. Specific binding of Ets-1 to the respective elements was demonstrated by competition analysis as well as by antibody supershift experiments. Cotransfection of an Ets-1 expression plasmid along with a GnT-V promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid revealed the participation of Ets-1 in the regulation of the GnT-V gene transcription.

Menne T. Stollewerk A. Scholz H. Klambt C. Cell. 1994; 78: 149-160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), whereas c-ets-2 appears to be important in cartilage/bone development and is one of the major factors of Down's syndrome (28Sumarsono S.H.

The expression of c-ets-1 is associated with the invasion of tumor cells in both in vitro and in vivo systems (29Vandenbunder B. Queva C. Desbiens X. Wernert N. Stehelin D.

Pathol. 1992; 140: 119-127PubMed Google Scholar). One possible mechanism by which Ets-related proteins promote invasion of tumor cells is that they enhance the transcription of matrix metalloproteinase genes (31Liabakk N.B. Talbot I. Smith R.A.

In contrast, Suzuki et al. (35Suzuki H. Romano-Spica V. Papas T.S. Bhat N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4442-4446Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) reported that overexpression of Ets-related protein in colon cancer cells reversed the transformed phenotype and tumorigenicity. These reports suggested that complicated systems of gene regulation may be mediated through Ets proteins. In this study, we focused on verifying the possible mechanisms related to transcriptional regulation of the GnT-V gene in human bile duct carcinoma HuCC-T1 cells. GnT-V, a glycosyltransferase related to tumor metastasis, has many Ets binding sites in its 5′-upstream regions. There is a possibility that Ets regulates the metastatic potential of tumor cells by enhancing or suppressing the GnT-V gene. In the present study, we investigated the role of Ets-1 in GnT-V gene transcription by gel mobility assaying, mutation analysis, and cotransfection assaying, and we identified specific cis-regulatory elements. These results show that the corresponding Ets-1 transcription factor was found to be potentially involved in the expression of the HuCC-T1-restricted GnT-V transcripts. The human bile duct carcinoma HuCC-T1 cells were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank. They were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Nakarai Tesque, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 50 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 50 units/ml penicillin. A fragment encoding the full-length sequence of Ets-1 was obtained by polymerase chain reaction and then cloned into the pSVK3 vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The nucleotide sequences were confirmed by general sequence analysis. This plasmid was digested with XhoI/SacI, and then the Ets-1 cDNA was subcloned into the XhoI/SacI site of the pET19b vector (Novagen), in which proteins were expressed under the control of a T7 promoter in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). 5′-Upstream regions of the GnT-V gene were inserted in front of the promoterless luciferase gene in the XhoI site (Klenow-filled) of the pGV enhancer vector (Toyo Ink Co., Ltd., Japan). The constructs were termed pGV−2760/−440 (SalI/XbaI, Klenow-filled), pGV−600/+23 (XbaI/PuvII, Klenow-filled), and pGV+23/+1123 containing 2.2 and 0.6 kb of the upstream regions of exon 1, and 1.0 kb of intron 1, respectively. A series of 5′-unidirectional deletions of pGV−2760/−440 and pGV−600/+23 was generated by the nested deletion method as described previously (36Henikoff S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The deleted nucleotide sites were confirmed by general sequence analysis. The plasmids, pGV−243/+23 and pGV−123/+23, of the upstream of exon 1, 200 and 100 bp in length, respectively, were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using a pair of oligonucleotide primers (sense, 5′-ggacgcgtTCTTACCATATAGAAC-3′, 5′-ggacgcgtGCCTAGATGATCAGTC-3′; and antisense, 5′-ggctcgagGCCTCTTACTGTTTTC-3′). The polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into the pT7 Blue-T vector (Novagen), sequenced, and then their sequences were compared with that of the 2.76-kb fragment. Each fragment was digested with the combination of MluI and XhoI, followed by subcloning into a pGV enhancer vector (MluI/XhoI site), which only contains a SV40 enhancer element. The DNA fragment containing the putative Ets binding sequences of the upstream regulation regions of the GnT-V of Ets-1 consensus binding sequence was synthesized as follows: E266, 5′-GGGAGTGAGGATGATGTAG-3′; E565, 5′-CTTGTTAAAGGATAGGCAGT-3′; E728, 5′-GGGGCAGAGGAACTTACGTT-3′; and EB, 5′-CGGCCAACCGGAAGCATGTGC-3′. The mutant sequence was also synthesized as mE266, 5′-GGGAGTGAGTATGATGTAG-3′; and mE728, 5′-GGGGCAGAGTAACTTACGTT-3′. Complementary oligonucleotides were annealed and used as probes or competitors. The probes were labeled at their 5′-extended ends with [γ-32P] dATP (Amersham Corp.) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara, Osaka, Japan). For the gel mobility shift assay, DNA (10,000 cpm, 32P-labeled) and nuclear extracts or proteins that had been prepared by in vitro transcription/translation were mixed, in a total volume of 20 ml, with a buffer comprising 65 mM KCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 6 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol. Two μg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma) was also added to each reaction mixture. For competition analysis, proteins were incubated in the presence of excess unlabeled oligonucleotides. For the supershift assay, anti-Ets-1 IgG (Cambridge Research Biochemicals), which does not cross-react with the Ets-2 protein, was added to the reaction mixture, followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were loaded on to 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 29:1), 0.5 × TBE (1 × TBE = 89 mM Tris, 89 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA), and then electrophoresis was carried out at 4°C at 150 V for 1 h. After the electrophoresis, the gels were dried with a gel dryer and then exposed to x-ray films (Kodak, Japan). HuCC-T1 cells were plated at 1.7 × 105 cells/60-mm dish for 1 day before transfection. They were transfected with a lipofectoamine reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 2-5 μg of various expression vectors containing 2 μg of reporter plasmids, various expression vectors, and pCH110 (Novagen), a β-galactosidase expression vector being used to measure the transfection efficiency. Briefly, 2-5 μg of diluted DNA and 5 μl of lipofectoamine reagent were mixed with 200 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 to form a DNA-liposome complex. After incubation for 30 min, 800 μl of serum-free medium was overlaid on the prerinsed cells. The cells were incubated with the complex for 6 h, followed by the addition of 1 ml of 20% fetal calf serum medium and incubation for a further 18 h. After the complex had been removed by washing, the cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h. Luciferase activity in cell lysates was determined with the use of a PicaGene™ Luminescence Kit (Toyo Ink Co.). The β-galactosidase activity in cell lysates was determined as reported previously (37Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) and used as an internal control for variations in transfection efficiency. The results represent the averages of three to five independent experiments. We demonstrated previously that the 5′-upstream regions of both exon 1 and intron 1 exhibited promoter activity when they were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells (16Saito H. Gu J. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Fujii J. Kohgo Y. Taniguchi N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). HuCC-T1 cells were also found to transcribe two types of message on 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA end (RACE) analysis (16Saito H. Gu J. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Fujii J. Kohgo Y. Taniguchi N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To elucidate the transcriptional mechanism for the human GnT-V gene in more detail, in particular to identify functional elements necessary for this cell line-restricted expression, GnT-V activity was measured (64.5 pmol/mg/h), and two types of transcripts of GnT-V were confirmed as well as previously (16Saito H. Gu J. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Fujii J. Kohgo Y. Taniguchi N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To examine the 2.76-kb SalI/PuvII upstream regions of exon 1 and 1.0 kb of intron 1 (Fig. 1A), which were isolated from a genomic clone of HuCC-T1 cells (16Saito H. Gu J. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Fujii J. Kohgo Y. Taniguchi N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we inserted the 2.76-kb SalI/PuvII fragment and 1.0 kb of intron 1 into the reporter plasmid pGV enhancer upstream of the luciferase gene to generate constructs PGV−2760/+23 and pGV+23/+1123 (Fig. 1A). We only detected luciferase activity for construct pGV+23/+1123 (Fig. 1B), detecting no luciferase activity for pGV−2760/+23 (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that the genomic insert in the pGV−2760/+23 construct included negative element(s), two additional pGV constructs containing smaller genomic fragments were analyzed (pGV−2760/−440 and pGV−600/+23). Although both constructs expressed luciferase activity, the pGV−2760/−440 one showed lower promoter activity compared with the SV40 promoter vector as a control. However, the corresponding deleted construct, pGV−1460/−440, showed strong promoter activity (313-fold) compared with that of the control plasmid (Fig. 2A). Among these constructs, pGV−600/+23 proved to be the most active because it showed 182-fold luciferase activity, pGV−2760/−440 and pGV+23/+1123 showing 124-fold and 169-fold luciferase activity, respectively, compared with the promoterless vector. These results strongly suggest that these two fragments act as promoters and that a negative element is present in the −2760/−1460 pGV construct.Fig. 2Transcriptional activity of the GnT-V promoter and its deletion constructs linked to the luciferase reporter gene upon transfection into HuCC-T1 cells. The relative luciferase activity of each deletion mutant derived from pGV−2764/−440 (panel A) or pGV−600/+23 (panel B) is expressed as a percentage of the activity of the pGV enhancer vector in HuCC-T1 cells, means ± S.D. for three to five independent experiments being presented.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To characterize further potential regulatory domains including Ets binding sites within the 5′-untranslated region of exon 1, we prepared a series of 5′-deleted constructs of the GnT-V 5′-untranslated region using plasmids pGV−2760/−440 and pGV−642/+23 and then transfected the deleted constructs into HuCC-T1 cells for luciferase activity determination (Fig. 1A). HuCC-T1 cells express endogenous GnT-V activity, which suggests that the cells contain the nuclear factors required for GnT-V promoter activity. The results are shown in Fig. 2, A and B, the pGV−1460/−440 construct exhibited a 2.5-fold increase in luciferase activity compared with pGV−2760/−440, indicating that the proximal region is more active than the full-length of the distal region. Further deletion, to nucleotide −710 bp, removes a potential Ets-1 binding site (position −728) and results in a 3.4-fold decrease in luciferase activity. Compared with construct pGV−642/+23, pGV−362/+23 exhibited more promoter activity, showing that this region could function as a core promoter of the GnT-V gene. The deletion in this region, extending to nucleotide −243 bp, removes another Ets-1 binding site (position −266), resulting in a 13.2-fold reduction in luciferase activity. Therefore, the most proximal region (−362/−243) is about 3.9-fold more active than the distal region (−1460/−710), showing the extremely high luciferase activity in the upstream region of the GnT-V gene. These results strongly suggest that the proximal region (−362/−243) and the distal region (−1460/−710) act as positive regulatory elements that up-regulate the promoter activity of the GnT-V gene in HuCC-T1 cells. However, further deletion of approximately 100-bp (pGV−112/+23) results in an 8.3-fold increase in activity in HuCC-T1 cells, suggesting the presence of negative regulatory elements in the −243/−112 region which may down-regulate the transcription of GnT-V in HuCC-T1 cells like the −2760/−1460 element. The deletion analysis described above indicated that the −1460/−710 and −362/−243 regions of this promoter act as cis-acting elements for HuCC-T1-restricted transcription. We have shown that several putative binding sites for LBP-1 (positions −1334, −1038, −935, and −932), AP-2 (positions −1264 and −227), nuclear factor-interleukin-6 (positions −1385, −1005, −965, and −255), c-myb (position −287), and Ets-1 (positions −728 and −266) are included in these two elements (16Saito H. Gu J. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Fujii J. Kohgo Y. Taniguchi N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We chose to focus our analysis on three putative binding sites for transcription factor Ets-1, which is a product of proto-oncogenes related to the malignant transformation and metastasis of tumors (31Liabakk N.B. Talbot I. Smith R.A. Wilkinson K. Balkwill F. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 190-196PubMed Google Scholar, 32Higashino F. Yoshida K. Noumi T. Seiki M. Fujinaga K.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2241-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). To determine whether or not the Ets-1 protein can bind to these putative binding sites of the GnT-V gene regulatory regions, gel mobility shift experiments were performed using 23-bp GnT-V promoter-derived oligonucleotides E266, E565, and E728, corresponding to the three putative Ets binding sites in the 5′-untranslated regions of the GnT-V gene (Table I). At first, we confirmed that the in vitro transcribed/translated truncated Ets-1 protein and nuclear extract of MOLT4 cells indeed bind to the Ets-1 consensus sequence (Fig. 3A). When radiolabeled E266, E565, and E728 were incubated with the in vitro transcribed/translated Ets-1 protein, as described under “Materials and Methods,” protein-DNA complexes were retarded in the cases of both E266 and E728, but not that of the E565 oligonucleotide (Fig. 3B, lanes 2, 7, and 12). Competition analysis was performed using excess unlabeled E266, E565, and E728 oligonucleotides, as shown in Fig. 3B. The unlabeled E266 and E728 oligonucleotides were found to compete with proteins binding to the labeled E266 and E728 probes, indicating the specific and high affinity binding of the Ets-1 protein to the Ets binding site of the GnT-V regulatory regions. The protein-DNA complex could be efficiently cross-competed with an excess of either E266 or E728, whereas oligonucleotides mE266 and mE728 containing a mutated Ets binding sequence did not compete (data not shown). These findings suggest that the in vitro transcribed/translated truncated Ets-1 protein recognizing the Ets consensus sequence can bind to the GnT-V promoter sequences, 5′-GGAGTGAGGATGATGTAGGGAAG-3′ and 5′-ATGGGGCAGAGGAACTTACGTTAT-3′, at positions −266 and −728Table IOligonucleotides used in gel mobility shift assayNameSequencePositionEB5′-CGGCCAACCGGAAGCATGTGC-3′Consensus Ets-1 siteE2665′-GGAGTGAGGATGATGTAGGGAAG-3′−278 to −255E5655′-CTTGTTAAAGGATAGGCTGTGGAC-3′−578 to −554E7285′-ATGGGGCAGAGGAACTTACGTTAT-3′−741 to −718mE2665′-GGAGTGATGAGTATGTAGGGAAG-3′Mutant of E265mE7285′-ATGGGGCAGAGTAACTTACGTTAT-3′Mutant of E728 Open table in a new tab To determine whether or not GnT-V promoter-derived Ets binding sites are associated with nuclear factors in the cells expressing Ets-1, we performed a gel mobility shift assay using the same GnT-V promoter-derived Ets binding sequence incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from MOLT4 cells, which highly expressed the Ets-1 protein. As shown in Fig. 3C, when the radiolabeled E266 and E728 oligonucleotides were incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from MOLT4 cells, retarded protein-DNA complexes were detected, and specific binding was identified on competition analysis (Fig. 3C, lanes 3 and 7). Binding of Ets was confirmed by an Ets-specific antiserum. The addition of anti-Ets-1 IgG resulted in competition with the protein-DNA complex (Fig. 3B, lanes 4 and 8), whereas the mE266 and mE728 oligonucleotides containing a mutated Ets binding sequence did not compete (Fig. 3D, lanes 4 and 7). These results revealed of the binding of an Ets-related factor to the 23-bp Ets binding site of the HuCC-T1-restricted promoter region of the GnT-V gene. To confirm the importance of Ets-1 in the regulation of GnT-V transcription in living cells, Ets-1 cDNA was subcloned into the pSVK3 vector, in which the SV40 promoter drives the expression of c-Ets-1 cDNA in mammalian cells. To determine whether or not the GnT-V gene can be activated by exclusive Ets stimulation, construct pGV−1460/−440 was cotransfected into HuCC-T1 cells along with an Ets-1 expression plasmid, SVETS-1. As shown in Fig. 4A, after HuCC-T1 cells had been transiently cotransfected with SVETS-1 and pGV−1460/−440, the luciferase activity increased more than 2.1-fold in the presence of 1 μg of the Ets-1 expression vector, whereas promoter activity decreased in the presence of 2 μg of the Ets-1 expression vector. However, we could observe a dose-dependent increase in the promoter activity when SVETS-1 and pGV−362/+23 were cotransfected into HuCC-T1 cells (Fig. 4B). Although the cause of this differential effect is unclear, this trans-activation result suggests that Ets1 may activate the GnT-V promoters that contain its binding sites. To investigate the regulation function in more detail, we used antisense Ets-1 mRNA to block the formation of Ets-1, which would interfere with the promoter activity of the human GnT-V gene in HuCC-T1 cells. This construct (SVETSA) was transiently cotransfected with pGV−1460/−440 and pGV−600/+23 into HuCC-T1 cells. However, as shown in Fig. 5A, pGV−1460/−440 caused a 60% decrease in luciferase activity when cotransfected with 1 μg of antisense expression plasmid (SVETSA), and a 100% reduction in luciferase activity was observed on cotransfection with 10 μg of anti-Ets-1 expression plasmid, whereas no change was observed in the promoter activity of pGV−600/+23 when it was cotransfected with the antisense expression vector (Fig. 5B). These findings may suggest that the transcription factor Ets-1 protein might positively regulate GnT-V gene transcription mediating complicated transcription mechanisms.Fig. 5Repression of GnT-V promoter expression by the antisense Ets-1 gene. HuCC-T1 cells were cotransfected with 2 μg of either the pGV−1460/−440 (panel A) or pGV−660/+23 (panel B) construct and increasing amounts of antisense Ets-1 expression plasmid SVETSA. The relative luciferase activity is represented as the means ± S.D. for three to five independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In most human epithelial tissues, the β1-6 branching of both N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides controls the polylactosamine content, which may be followed by sialic acid addition as a terminal sugar residue (38Yogeswarren G.

At present, liver transplantation is the only definitive treatment for Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I. Because the liver is structurally normal, substitution of the mutant gene to correct the metabolic abnormality would be an attractive alternative treatment.

Recombinant retroviruses and adenoviruses are being used for somatic gene therapy (7Raper S. Wilson J.M. Boyer J.L. Ockner R.K. Progress in Liver Disease. Vol XIII. W. B. Saunders, New York1995: 201Google Scholar). Retroviruses integrate into the host genome, providing long term gene expression, but retroviral gene transfer requires cell division, which is infrequent in hepatocytes in vivo (7Raper S. Wilson J.M. Boyer J.L. Ockner R.K. Progress in Liver Disease. Vol XIII. W. B. Saunders, New York1995: 201Google Scholar). In contrast, recombinant adenoviruses are highly efficient in transferring foreign genes to quiescent cells, can be generated at high titers (8Jaffe H.A. Danel C. Longenecker G. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), and are potentially useful for gene therapy (8Jaffe H.A. Danel C. Longenecker G. Nat.

Furthermore, we and others have shown that after systemic administration, recombinant adenovirus 5 (Ad5) localizes preferentially to the liver, and can express the transgene in over 90% of the hepatocytes (8Jaffe H.A.

Raven Press, New York1990: 1679Google Scholar). First generation replication-defective recombinant adenoviruses are generated by disrupting the E1 region. These vectors achieve a high level of gene transfer, but integration into the cell genome is rare (9Horwitz M.S. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Virology.

Virol. 1989; 70: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and the transgene expression is of short duration. Studies in immune-deficient mice indicate that the duration of gene expression may be limited by host immune response (13Yang Y. Li Q. Ertl H.C.J. Wilson J.M. J. Virol. 1995; 95: 2004-2015Crossref Google Scholar, 14Dai Y. Schwarz E.M. Gu D. Zhang W.W. Sarvetnick N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1401-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Moreover, neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL) that develop in the host after the initial injection of the virus prevents transgene expression upon subsequent administrations (13Yang Y. Li Q. Ertl H.C.J. Wilson J.M. J. Virol. 1995; 95: 2004-2015Crossref Google Scholar). In an attempt to prevent any possible viral gene expression in vivo, “second generation” vectors were produced using an adenoviral strain with a mutated E2a gene that expresses a temperature sensitive DNA-binding protein (15Yang Y. Nunes F.A. Berencsi K. Gonczol E. Engelhardt J.R. Wilson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 7: 362-369Google Scholar). These viruses caused less liver and lung inflammation, but long term gene expression was difficult to achieve (15Yang Y. Nunes F.A. Berencsi K. Gonczol E. Engelhardt J.R. Wilson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 7: 362-369Google Scholar). It is possible that antigens present in the input virus may be sufficient to evoke the immune response. Administration of antigens during the neonatal period induces tolerance by several mechanisms, including clonal deletion of antigen-specific T cells, T cell-mediated suppression of regulatory cells (e.g. helper T cells), and secretion of factors that suppress the generation of antigen-specific effector cells (16Matriano J.A. Socarras S. Streilein J.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1505-1514PubMed Google Scholar, 17Matriano J.M. Socarras S. Streilein W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1515-1523PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we show that injection of recombinant adenoviruses into neonatal Gunn rats prevents the development of neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic lymphocytes, thereby permitting long term gene therapy by repeated injection of the vector. Homozygous Gunn rats were bred in our colony at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, maintained on standard laboratory chow, and kept in 12-h light/dark cycles. Newborn and adult rats of both genders were used for these studies. pJM17, containing the sequences of adenovirus Type 5, was kindly provided by Dr. F. L. Graham, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada. pRC/CMV (Invitrogen) was partially digested with PvuII, and BglII linkers (Boehringer Mannheim, IN) were inserted at nucleotide position 1290. The NotI-SpeI fragment of pSVK3-hBUGT1 was subcloned into pRc/CMV-BglII. The resulting expression cassette including the promoter and enhancer sequence for the immediate early gene of cytomegalovirus, the structural region of human BUGT1, and the polyadenylation signal from bovine growth hormone was cloned into a shuttle vector, pAd-BglII, generating pAd-BglII-hBUGT1. The recombinant adenovirus Ad-hBUGT1 was generated by cotransfection of pAd-BglII-hBUGT1 and pJM17 into 293 cells as described (18Graham F.L. Prevec L. Murray E.J. Methods in Molecular Biology. The Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1991: 109Google Scholar). Briefly, 293 cells were seeded at 70-80% confluence in 24-well plates and transfected for 20 h with 250 μl of transfection mixture containing 2 μg of pAd-BglII-hBUGT1, 3 μg of pJM17 mixed with 1 ml of OptiMEM containing 20 μl of Lipofectin® (Life Technologies, Inc.)/well. After transfection, 293 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 2% fetal calf serum until a cytopathic effect was observed. Ad-hBUGT1 was plaque-purified, and the integration of hBUGT1 cDNA was confirmed by Southern blotting using viral DNA prepared by a modified Hirt procedure (19Wilson J.M. Grossman M. Cabrera J.A. Wu C.H. Wu G.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11483-11489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ad-LacZ, a recombinant adenovirus expressing Escherichia coli β-galactosidase with a nuclear localization signal, was generated in the same manner. Recombinant adenoviruses were grown on 293 cells, a human embryonic kidney cell line that supplies the product of the E1 region in trans, allowing the recombinant vectors to propagate (18Graham F.L. Prevec L. Murray E.J. Methods in Molecular Biology. The Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1991: 109Google Scholar). The 293 cells were grown in suspension culture at a cell density of 5 × 105/ml using calcium-free essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% calf serum. The cells (1.6 × 109), were then infected by suspending them in 3 liters of supernatant from adenovirus-infected 293 cells that had been allowed to lyse completely. Cells were harvested 72 h after infection and resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Recombinant adenovirus was purified from the cell lysate by two consecutive CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugations on preformed gradients, and stored in 30% glycerol at −20°C. Virus was dialyzed overnight at 4°C against an isotonic solution containing 135 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 10% glycerol, and sterilized by filtration through 0.2-μm filters before use. Six groups of 10 rats each were studied (Table I). Group A were Gunn rats that received three intravenous injections Ad-hBUGT1 at the ages of 1-3, 56, and 112 days, respectively. Group B Gunn rats received Ad-hBUGT1 injection intravenously as newborns, and the second and third injections, at ages 56 and 112 days, respectively, into the portal vein. Group C were newborn Gunn rats injected with Ad-LacZ intravenously. Group D were adult Gunn rats injected intravenously with Ad-hBUGT1. Group E were newborn normal RHA rats injected intravenously with Ad-hBUGT1 virus. Group F included newborn Gunn rats injected intravenously with Ad-hBUGT1 for the first injection, followed by Ad-LacZ intravenously for the second injection. Newborn rats were injected 1 × 108 pfu of the recombinant adenovirus into the right jugular vein. All other injections (3 × 109 pfu) were given into tail veins or intraportally where indicated (Table I).Table IExperimental groupsGroupRat strain and age at first injectionVirusRoute of injectionANewborn GunnAd-hBUGT1IntravenousBNewborn GunnAd-hBUGT1Intravenous for the first injection; intraportal injection for the second and third injectionsCNewborn GunnAd-LacZIntravenousDAdult GunnAd-hBUGT1IntravenousENewborn RHAAd-hBUGT1IntravenousFNewborn GunnAd-hBUGT1 for the first injection followed by Ad-LacZIntravenous Open table in a new tab Four adult Gunn rats injected with Ad-hBUGT1 were killed 4-48 h after virus administration. Various tissue samples were snap-frozen in acetone/dry ice baths. To determine the distribution of the transgene, Southern blot analysis was performed as follows. The tissue was homogenized in 1.2 ml/100 mg tissue of 10 mM Tris HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 25 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, pH 8.0, for preparation of DNA. The lysate was incubated overnight with 200 μg/ml proteinase K at 37°C. After three extractions of phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol, RNA was removed from the lysate by RNase treatment, followed by phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction. DNA was precipitated with ethanol. DNA samples (10 μg) were digested with HindIII, separated by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane (GeneScreen R, DuPont NEN) by capillary blotting. The filter was hybridized with a 32P-labeled 2.1-kilobase pair NotI to SpeI fragment of pSVK3-BUGT1 or a 5881-base pair EcoRI fragment of adenovirus type 5. The filter was reprobed with rat albumin cDNA to correct for small variations in DNA loading. The blot was washed under high stringency conditions according to standard protocols and exposed to x-ray film. β-Galactosidase and human BUGT1 expression were determined as described below. Rats were anesthetized with ether and surgical wedge biopsies (50-100 mg) of the liver were performed from two different lobes through a midline incision. The specimens were frozen in tissue freezing medium (Triangle Biomedical Sciences, Durham, NC) on methyl butane baths cooled on dry ice. Cryostat sections (6 μm) were fixed at room temperature in freshly prepared 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 5 min. β-Galactosidase activity was determined by immersing the section into 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indole-β-galactopyranoside staining solution (5 mM K4FeCN6, 5 mM K3FeCN6, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mg of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indole-β-galactopyranoside/ml) for 8-15 h at 37°C. Sections were briefly counterstained with eosin, dehydrated, and mounted. The bile ducts of four adult Gunn rats were cannulated with polyethylene catheters under ether anesthesia. A separate cannula was introduced into the duodenum, and the rats were placed in a restraining cage. After the body temperature returned to normal, bile was collected on ice in a darkened room. Samples were collected at 30-min intervals, and the remaining bile was returned via the duodenal cannula to avoid bile salt depletion and dehydration. Bile samples were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a μBondapak C-18 column (Millipore-Waters, Milford, MA), as described previously (20Roy Chowdhury J. Roy Chowdhury N. Wu G. Shouval R. Arias I.M. Hepatology. 1981; 1: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In brief, the HPLC column was equilibrated with 50 mM ammonium acetate/acetic acid (pH 4.5) and 50% methanol. Following injection of 0.2 ml of a 1:1 mixture of bile and methanol, the pigments were eluted with a linear gradient of 50-100% methanol in ammonium acetate over 60 min at 1 ml/min. Peaks were detected by absorbance at 436 nm, identified by retention time using authentic pigment standards, and quantitated by integration of the peak areas. Surgical wedge biopsies were performed as described for β-galactosidase assay and stored at −80°C until use. RNA was extracted, and a segment of the 5′ domain of human BUGT1 mRNA was amplified by reverse transcription-primed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as described previously using the following primers: sense, 5′-AAGGAAAGGGTCCGTCAGCA-3′ (nucleotides 141-160 from the translational start codon), and antisense: 5′-CCAGCAGCTGCAGCAGAGG-3′ (nucleotides 441-462 from the translational start codon) to amplify a segment of the unique amino-terminal domain of human BUGT1 mRNA. RT-PCR was performed as described previously (1Bosma P.J. Seppen J. Goldhoorn B. Bakker C. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Chowdhury J.R. Chowdhury N.R. Jansen P.L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17960-17964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (denaturation: 94°C for 30 s, annealing 58°C for 30 s, extension 72°C for 60 s, 30 cycles). A fragment of the biopsy specimens was homogenized in 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, using a glass homogenizer fitted with a motorized Teflon pestle. Proteins (100 μg/lane) were resolved by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. Human BUGT1 bands were visualized using a monoclonal antibody WP1 directed at the common carboxyl-terminal domain of UGT isoforms expressed by human ugt1 gene (4Ritter J.K. Chen F. Sheen Y.Y. Tran H.M. Kimura S. Yeatman M.T. Owens I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3257-3261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a goat anti-mouse IgG Fab′ fragment second antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma Diagnostics). Tissue homogenates were prepared from liver biopsy specimens from two different lobes of the liver and UGT activity toward bilirubin was determined by a sensitive HPLC-based method as described previously (1Bosma P.J. Seppen J. Goldhoorn B. Bakker C. Oude Elferink R.P.J. Chowdhury J.R. Chowdhury N.R. Jansen P.L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17960-17964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Roy Chowdhury J. Roy Chowdhury N. Wu G. Shouval R. Arias I.M. Hepatology. 1981; 1: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Approximately 0.3 ml blood samples were collected from tail veins every 6-10 days in all groups, and serum bilirubin concentrations were determined (21Jendrasik L. Grof P. Biochem. Z. 1938; 297: 81Google Scholar). For definitive evaluation of bilirubin glucuronidation, selected rat were provided with a polyethylene bile duct cannula and pigments excreted in bile were analyzed by HPLC using a μBondapak C-18 column (Millipore-Waters, Milford, MA) as described (20Roy Chowdhury J. Roy Chowdhury N. Wu G. Shouval R. Arias I.M. Hepatology. 1981; 1: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Humoral and cell-mediated immune response to the initial and subsequent injections of the recombinant adenoviruses were determined as described below. In addition, biochemical and histological evidence for liver damage were evaluated. Liver biopsy specimens collected at 3-4-week intervals were fixed in 10% formaldehyde. Paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin by standard procedures and examined by light microscopy. The sections were graded for hepatic inflammation as follows: Grade 0, normal; Grade 1, mild periportal or focal lobular lymphocytic infiltration; Grade 2, extension of lymphocytic infiltration into the lobules and “piece-meal necrosis”; and Grade 3, disruption of the lobular architecture by “bridging necrosis” and extension of lymphocytic infiltrates from portal to central, portal to portal, and central to central zones. As a measure of hepatic inflammation, ALT levels were quantified using a commercially available kit (Sigma). Rat anti-adenovirus-neutralizing serum antibodies were measured every 3-4 weeks. 293 cells were seeded at 3 × 104/well in 96-well plates, and cultured until 90% confluence. Ad-LacZ was diluted in cell culture medium to 3 × 105 pfu/10 μl. Serum samples were heat-inactivated at 55°C for 30 min and diluted in medium in two steps. 0.1 ml of each serum dilution was mixed with 5 × 105 of the recombinant virus, incubated at 37°C for 90 min, and applied to the nearly confluent 293 cells for 10-14 h. The medium, containing serum and virus, was then replaced by RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum. After 18 h, the cells were fixed and stained for β-galactosidase expression. In the absence of neutralizing antibodies, all of the cells stained blue. The neutralizing antibody titer for each serum sample was reported as the highest dilution at which less than 25% of the cells stained blue. Adenovirus-infected primary hepatocytes, obtained as described above, were plated on collagen-coated dishes with Chee's medium (22Kass-Eisler Falck-Pederson E. Elfenbein D.H. Alvira M. Buttrick P.M. Leinwand L.A. Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 395-402PubMed Google Scholar) (2 × 106 cells/well in six-well plates) and were used as target cells for the effector lymphocytes. Two rats from each group were studied for CTL activity, on days 28, 56, 112, and 140 after the first injection. Inguinal and paraaortic lymph nodes were removed and gently disrupted using a rubber policeman. Red blood cells were removed using lysis buffer containing 8.3 g/liter NH4Cl, 1 g/liter KHCO3, 100 μl of EDTA at pH 7.4 (1 ml/spleen or 5-10 lymph nodes) for 2 min. Lymphocytes were pelleted by centrifugation and plated at 5 × 107/5 ml in RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were restimulated with Ad-hBUGT1 with at a multiplicity of infection of 10, for 4-5 days. The stimulated effector cells were harvested, counted and added to the primary hepatocyte cultures at a ratio of 50-100:1, and incubated at 37°C for 5 h. Hepatic cell lysis was estimated by measuring ALT levels using a commercial kit (Sigma Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that the reagent and the test samples were mixed at equal volumes and the incubation was for 90 s. Product formation was proportional to the duration of incubation. ALT levels were expressed in international units. ALT levels in the medium of culture dishes containing adenovirally infected hepatocytes with the addition of CTLs from naive animals ranged from 110 to 200 IU (150 ± 41, mean ± S.D.; n = 20) and were considered background. CTL activity was expressed in IU of ALT averaged from six wells after subtraction of background. Maximum possible ALT release from the cells was estimated by incubating the cells with 5 mMD-(+)-galactosamine overnight, which resulted in ALT levels of 3500-4000 IU. Two tolerized rats from each group were injected with wild-type adenovirus 5 (1 × 109 pfu), 132 and 142 days after the third injection. All rats were reexamined for serum bilirubin levels, the appearance of neutralizing antibodies and CTL response 4 days after each injection of the wild-type virus. Four hours and 24 h after the injection of Ad-hBUGT1, adenoviral DNA in various tissues was examined by Southern blot analysis using a probe for the hBUGT1. The Ad-hBUGT1 DNA was detectable predominantly in the liver, with only traces being present in other tissues (Fig. 1). Based on the assumption of a body weight:liver weight ratio of 25:1, 90-95% of the injected viral dose was estimated to be recovered in the liver. Liver specimens of two rats in Groups C and F were examined 10 days after each Ad-LacZ injection. Nearly all hepatocytes showed positive nuclear staining for β-galactosidase activity following each injection (Fig. 2). In addition, liver biopsy was performed in two rats immediately before the third injection (day 108); only 1-2% of the cells in these specimens showed positive staining. After glucuronidation, bilirubin is excreted in bile almost immediately, which permitted the determination of the time required for the expression of functional bilirubin-UGT activity in Gunn rat livers after the injection of Ad-hBUGT1. HPLC analysis of bile samples showed that significant amounts of bilirubin monoglucuronide and diglucuronide began to be excreted in bile 3.5 h after the virus injections. After 6 h, the pigment composition of bile resembled that in normal rats. By Southern blot analysis, positive signals for hBUGT1 were identified in Group A after each of the three injections, while positive signals were found only after the first injection in Group D (data not shown). Biopsy specimens collected before the third injection (day 108) showed that the DNA was barely detectable by Southern blot. RT-PCR of RNA extracted from liver biopsy specimens (Fig. 3) showed the expected 321-base pair amplicon of the human BUGT1 mRNA after each injection of Ad-hBUGT1, in Groups A and B, but only after the first injection in Group D. Liver biopsy specimens from two rats in each groups 14 days after each injection showed immunoreactive 52-kDa bands, corresponding to human bilirubin-UGT1 in the treated Gunn rats in Groups A and B (Fig. 4). In Group D, the protein was expressed only after the first injection. BUGT activity was not detectable in the liver of untreated Gunn rats or Gunn rats that received Ad-LacZ (Group C). Two days and 56 days after the first injection of Ad-hBUGT1 in newborn Gunn rats (Groups A and B), hepatic bilirubin-UGT activities were 80 ± 28 and 27 ± 5.8 nmol/mg liver wet weight·min (mean ± S.E., n = 6), respectively. Ten days after the third injection in Groups A and B, hepatic BUGT activity again increased to 90 ± 25 and 108 ± 45 nmol/mg liver wet weight·min (mean ± S.E., n = 6), respectively. In Group D (rats receiving the first dose as adults), comparable levels of hepatic BUGT activities were detected in the liver 2 and 56 days after the first injection (70 ± 22 and 6.8 ± 0.77 nmol/mg liver wet weight·min (mean ± S.E., n = 6), respectively), but no BUGT activity was detectable after the third injection. Hepatic bilirubin-UGT activities achieved in Gunn rat livers after Ad-hBUGT1 injections were comparable to those in normal Wistar rats (75 ± 20 nmol/mg liver weight·min; mean ± S.E., n = 6). HPLC profiles of pigments (Fig. 5) in the bile from rats in Groups A and B 3-4 weeks after each Ad-hBUGT1 injection resembled that in congeneic normal Wistar RHA rats. Bilirubin monoglucuronide and diglucuronide constituted 53% and 46% of the pigments, respectively, only 1-1.4% being unconjugated bilirubin. Ad-LacZ-injected rats did not excrete detectable amounts of bilirubin glucuronides in bile, and more than 98% of the pigments was unconjugated bilirubin. In Group D, after the first injection, the bile pigment profile resembled that in Groups A and B, but only minimal amounts of bilirubin glucuronides were excreted after subsequent injections. In initial experiments, four newborn Gunn rats were injected with Ad LacZ and four were injected with Ad-hBUGT1 24 h after birth. Four additional newborns were injected with normal saline (control). All groups were killed by exsanguination 48 h after the injection. Serum bilirubin levels, 48 h after the injection, in the control group and the Ad LacZ-injected pups were 9 ± 1.3 and 9.1 ± 1.1 mg/dl (mean ± S.D.), respectively. In the Ad-hBUGT1-injected pups, serum bilirubin concentrations were reduced to 2.0 ± 0.12 mg/dl (Fig. 6). In Groups A, B, and C (newborn Gunn rat recipients), bilirubin levels were studied every 7-14 days starting on day 21 in the newborn rats. In Group D (adult Gunn rat recipients), serum bilirubin levels were determined from the beginning of the experimental protocol. Newborn Gunn rats have distinctly yellow skin color within 24 h of birth and are easily distinguishable from normal or heterozygous pups. Twenty-four hours after the injection of Ad-hBUGT1, the skin color of treated Gunn rat pups resembled that of normal pups. The skin color did not change in pups that received Ad-LacZ. Marked decrease in serum bilirubin levels occurred after each Ad-hBUG"

In contrast to other plant RLK, the kinase used an intra- rather than an intermolecular phosphorylation mechanism. After protein cleavage with formic acid, most of the radioactivity was in a 14.1-kDa peptide located at the end of the kinase domain.

All RPK contain an extracellular domain connected by a membrane-spanning amino acid (AA) stretch to the intracellular kinase domain. The proteins can be subdivided into two groups that autophosphorylate on Ser/Thr or on Tyr residues, and oligomerization appears to play an important role in the regulation of enzyme activity (1Ullrich A.

Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar). receptor protein kinase receptor-like protein kinase amino acids circular first strand cDNA-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends C. roseus RLK1 epidermal growth factor maltose-binding protein polymerase chain reaction deoxyadenosine 5′-O-(1-thiotriphosphate) kilobase pair(s) base pair(s). Several plant cDNAs and genes for RPK homologs sharing the same basic domain structure have been described. They were called receptor-like kinases (RLK), because the ligands are unknown and their function as receptors has not yet been demonstrated. Several groups are presently distinguished, and the classification is usually based on the sequences in the extracellular domain (reviewed in 2Braun D.M. Walker J.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 70-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar): (a) the S-domain type, with similarities to the S-locus glycoproteins in Brassica; these proteins also contain ten or more cysteines in conserved positions; (b) the leucine-rich repeat type, with 9-26 Leu-rich repeats; and (c) the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like type that contains several EGF-like repeats. Very recent data suggest two additional types, with the extracellular region related either to plant defense proteins (3Wang X. Zafian P. Choudhary M. Lawton M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2598-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) or to lectins (4Swarup, R., Dumas, C., Cock, J. M., (1996) Plant Physiol., Plant Gene Register PGR 96–022.Google Scholar), but the investigations have not been extended much beyond the sequences. The physiological functions of plant RLKs are unknown, except for the S-domain type RLKs from Brassica that appear to be involved in the self-incompatibility phenotype (5Stein J.C. Howlett B. Boyes D.C. Nasrallah M.E. Nasrallah J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8816-8820Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 6Goring D.R. Glavin T.L. Schafer U. Rothstein S.J.

There is considerable interest also in the other RLK because they are thought to be involved in extracellular signal perception, in particular in plant development, plant/microbe interactions, and disease resistance phenomena (reviewed in 8Hammond-Kosack K.E. Jones D.A. Jones J.D.G. New Phytol. 1996; 133: 11-24Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies after heterologous protein expression in Escherichia coli showed that autophosphorylation of the plant RLK is on Ser and/or Thr, with the possible exception of a Petunia RLK that uses Ser and Tyr residues (9Mu J.H. Lee H.-S. Kao T.-H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 709-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation appears to occur predominantly by intermolecular phosphorylation (trans), and it has been suggested that oligomerization may be involved in the regulation of the kinase activity (10Horn M.A. Walker J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1208: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The sites of autophosphorylation have not yet been identified in any RLK. CrRLK1, the protein kinase from Catharanthus roseus described in this work, is interesting for several reasons. It represents a novel RLK type, and in contrast to other plant RLK it autophosphorylates predominantly with an intra- rather than with an intermolecular mechanism. We also report the first identification of a Thr residue in a RLK that is important for both autophosphorylation and the activity of the kinase to phosphorylate other proteins. The Thr is conserved in some other related plant kinases, suggesting that these may follow the same activation mechanism. The cell suspension culture of Madagascar periwinkle (C. roseus L. G. Don, line CP3a), its maintenance on MX medium, and the nutritional downshift by incubating the cells in an 8% sucrose solution have been described (11Knobloch K.-H. Berlin J. Z. Naturforsch. 1980; 35c: 551-556Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 12Schiel O. Witte L. Berlin J. Z. Naturforsch. 1987; 42c: 1075-1081Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Poly(A)-enriched RNA was isolated (13Schröder G. Brown J.W.S. Schröder J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) from C. roseus cell cultures treated for 7.5 h with a change from MX medium to 8% sucrose (14Vetter H.-P. Mangold U. Schröder G. Marner F.-J. Werck-Reichhart D. Schröder J. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 998-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The Northern blots were performed according to published procedures (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The cDNA library was constructed using 5 μg of poly(A)-enriched RNA and cDNA synthesis kits from Amersham Corp. (cDNA Synthesis System Plus, Catalog No. RPN1256Y) and Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc. (You-Prime cDNA Synthesis Kit No. 27-9273-01). After addition of EcoRI linkers and digestion with EcoRI, the cDNAs were ligated to EcoRI-digested phage λNM1149 (13Schröder G. Brown J.W.S. Schröder J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and packaged with a kit from Amersham Corp. (Lambda In Vitro Packaging Kit No. N334L). The screening procedures have been described (13Schröder G. Brown J.W.S. Schröder J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 14Vetter H.-P. Mangold U.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The 5′ end of the mRNA was obtained with the cRACE technique that uses the circularization of single-stranded cDNA and polymerase chain reaction amplifications with two sets of primers (16Maruyama I.N. Rakow T.L. Maruyama H.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3796-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The position of the primers in the first cDNA were 396 → 375 (first strand cDNA synthesis), 215 → 198 and 254 → 272 (first amplification of circularized cDNA), and 103 → 81 and 327 → 348 (nested primers for second amplification). The DNA fragments were cloned blunt-end into the SmaI site of vector pTZ19R. The Southern blots were performed with published procedures (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). They identified a 8.3-kbp EcoRI and a 2.5-kbp Asp718 fragment (see “Results”), and both were analyzed. For the EcoRI fragment, the fragments in the range from 7-10 kbp were eluted from the gel and cloned into the EcoRI site of λNM1149 (13Schröder G. Brown J.W.S. Schröder J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The fragment was recloned into vector pTZ19R after its identification by screening with the cDNA. With the Asp718 fragment, the 5′ end of the gene was obtained by inverse PCR (17Hengen P.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 372-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with the circularized 2.5-kbp genomic Asp718 fragment, using oligonucleotides corresponding to the positions 348 → 327 and 969 → 990 of the cDNA. The blunt-ended fragment was cloned into vector pTZ19R. The cDNA and the gene were sequenced on both strands by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination technique using vectors and phages as described in 18Von Lintig J. Zanker H. Schröder J. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1991; 4: 370-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. The pTZ18R and pTZ19R system, helper phage M13K07, E. coli strain JM109 (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc.), and the reverse sequencing and the universal primers (Boehringer Mannheim) or custom-synthesized oligonucleotides were used with subcloned cDNA fragments. DNA polymerization reactions were performed with [35S]dATPαS (37 TBq/mmol, Amersham Corp.) and modified T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase, Biochemical Corp.). The protein motifs were identified according to 19Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2013-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar and 20Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2296) Google Scholar. TBLASTN (21Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) was employed for similarity searches in the data bases. We used translational fusions of the 42.7-kDa maltose-binding protein (MBP, expressed from vector pMAL-c2; New England Biolabs) (22Maina C.V. Riggs P.D. Grandea A.G.I. Slatko B.E. Moran L.S. Tagliamonte J.A. McReynolds L.A. Guan C. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) with polypeptides encoded in the first cDNA. The expression was carried out with the complete coding region in the cDNA (MCPK0, fusion = 126 kDa), with the N-terminal 55.3-kDa (MCPK2, fusion = 98 kDa), and with the 43.2-kDa catalytic domain (MCPK1, fusion = 86 kDa) (see Fig. 1C for overview). To express MCPK0, the cDNA was excised with EcoRI, the single-stranded ends were filled in, and the blunt-end fragment was inserted into the XmnI site of pMAL-c2. MCPK2 was obtained by deletion of the sequences downstream of the Asp718 site. MCPK1 was constructed by using the EcoRV site in the putative membrane-spanning region (position 1071 in the cDNA). The MBP part in the fusion proteins allowed a one-step affinity purification on amylose-resin columns (22Maina C.V. Riggs P.D. Grandea A.G.I. Slatko B.E. Moran L.S. Tagliamonte J.A. McReynolds L.A. Guan C. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The procedures followed the protocol provided by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). In some cases, the E. coli strain PR745 (New England Biolabs) was used for protein expression because it provided a higher yield of the fusion proteins and less degradation products. The mutagenesis was performed with suitable subfragments in vector pTZ19R and single-stranded DNA obtained with helper phage M13K07 in E. coli strain RZ1032 (23Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). In all cases, the original fragments in the pMAL-c2 expression constructs were exchanged against the mutated fragments after verification of the changes by DNA sequence analysis. The expression of the correct size fusion proteins was confirmed, and the proteins were affinity-purified as described above. The essential Lys (position 499) in the phosphotransfer site was changed to Arg with the oligonucleotide 5′ GTA GCT GTG AGA AGA GGG 3′ (mutated base underlined), and the proteins containing the mutation were called MCPK0* and MCPK1* (Fig. 1C). A subclone containing the 3′-terminal Asp718 fragment was used to exchange the four Thr residues in the C-terminal 14.1-kDa polypeptide (positions 720, 734, 767, 795) to Ala with appropriate custom-synthesized oligonucleotides. The standard incubations (60 μl) contained 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 10 mM MnCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20 μM unlabeled ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (>185 TBq/mmol, Amersham Buchler, Braunschweig), and they were started by the addition of 6 μg of purified MBP-protein kinase fusion. Assays with dephosphorylated β-casein (Sigma) contained 5 μg of the substrate protein. After 25 min at 25°C, the incubations were stopped by addition of 4.2 μl of 0.1 M unlabeled ATP. The proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (28% final concentration) for 30 min on ice. The pellets obtained after centrifugation were washed three times with ice-cold acetone, solubilized in 60 μl of sample buffer (0.16 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol) for 10 min at 95°C. The proteins were separated in 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore) or nitrocellulose sheets, and autoradiographed. In most cases, the radioactive band was, in addition, excised, and the radioactivity was quantified by scintillation spectrometry (Cerenkov counting). The incubations followed the standard assays except for the following modifications. The amount of MBP-protein kinase fusion was raised to 10 μg, the [γ-32P]ATP was increased to 10 μCi, and the incubations were carried out at 37°C for 40 min. The radioactive proteins from 10 assays were analyzed by gel electrophoresis, blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane, and stained with Ponceau S red (0.5% solution in 10% acetic acid). The 126-kDa bands were excised and treated with 6 ml of 70% formic acid for 48 h with vigorous shaking at 37°C to cleave the protein between Asp-Pro residues (24Landon M. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and to solubilize the polypeptides (25Anderson P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 148: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose membrane was removed, and the extract was dried by vacuum centrifugation. The residue was dissolved in 70 μl of sample buffer and subjected to Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (26Schägger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Labeled polypeptides were detected by autoradiography. For phosphoamino acid analysis, the polypeptides were blotted to Immobilon membranes. The most heavily labeled peptide (14.1 kDa) was excised and hydrolyzed under nitrogen for 90 min at 110°C in 6 N HCl (27Kamps M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The hydrolysate was dried in a vacuum centrifuge and washed twice with distilled water. The residue was dissolved in 10 μl of distilled water, spotted onto a thin layer cellulose plate, and analyzed by ascending chromatography with a solvent consisting of propionic acid, 25% ammonium hydroxide, and isopropyl alcohol (45:17.5:17.5; v/v/v) (procedure modified from 28Neufeld E. Goren H.J. Boland D. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled AA were detected by autoradiography. Standards with authentic phosphothreonine, phosphoserine, and phosphotyrosine (Sigma) were run in separate lanes and visualized with a ninhydrin spray (Sigma). A fragment containing the complete 2667-bp cDNA, but with the Lys in the phosphotransfer site mutated to Arg, was inserted into the NcoI site of the expression vector pQE-6 (29Crowe J. Henco K. The QIAexpressionist. Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA1992Google Scholar), thus providing a start codon and the signals necessary for regulated protein expression. The plasmid was maintained in E. coli strain M15[pRep4] (29Crowe J. Henco K. The QIAexpressionist. Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA1992Google Scholar). The cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani medium (1% Bacto-tryptone, 0.5% Bacto-yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, 0.2% glycerol, 0.02% MgSO4 (pH 7.5)), and protein expression was induced with 2 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37°C. The protein (CPK0*) was isolated with the techniques detailed in Strebel et al. (30Strebel K. Beck E. Strohmaier K. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1986; 57: 983-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and then used to raise antibodies in a hen. The immunoblots (14Vetter H.-P. Mangold U. Schröder G. Marner F.-J. Werck-Reichhart D. Schröder J. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 998-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) were performed with the IgY fraction (BioTools, Denzlingen, Germany) and a secondary antibody (rabbit anti-chicken) coupled with alkaline phosphatase (Sigma). The first cDNA was identified fortuitously during a screen of a library from cell cultures transferred from the standard growth medium to an aqueous 8% sucrose solution. This nutritional downshift was originally used for the induction of alkaloid biosynthesis (11Knobloch K.-H. Berlin J. Z. Naturforsch. 1980; 35c: 551-556Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 12Schiel O. Witte L. Berlin J. Z. Naturforsch. 1987; 42c: 1075-1081Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and more recently for the cloning of induced cytochrome P450 (14Vetter H.-P. Mangold U. Schröder G. Marner F.-J. Werck-Reichhart D. Schröder J. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 998-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The cDNA contained 2667 bp and an open reading frame of 750 AA that started in the EcoRI site and terminated at position 2251 (see scheme in Fig. 1A). Similarity searches in the data bases indicated that the C-terminal 300 AA represented the catalytic domain of a protein kinase that was separated from the large N-terminal region by a putative membrane-spanning stretch. This suggested that the cDNA encoded a RLK. The expected N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence was absent in the cDNA, and the size of the mRNA (3 kb, Fig. 2B) suggested that the cDNA lacked the 5′ end of the mRNA. The RNA blots also showed that the mRNA was of very low abundance and that it was in fact not induced by the nutritional downshift of the cultures. The 5′ end was obtained with the cRACE technique, and several independent clones indicated that the mRNA started at least 336 bp upstream of the EcoRI site. The first AUG was 159 bases upstream of the restriction site, and this increased the size of the protein by 53 AA. The genomic blot revealed a simple pattern of strongly hybridizing fragments (Fig. 2A), suggesting a single copy gene. The 8.3-kbp EcoRI fragment was cloned and analyzed. The kinase sequence was located at the end of the fragment, terminating in an EcoRI site that corresponded to that at the 5′ end of the cDNA. No introns were detected in the protein coding region, but the cDNA and genomic sequences diverged in the last 109 bp of the 3′ noncoding region in the cDNA. A repeated data base search showed that the sequences in the cDNA were from E. coli (x in Fig. 1A). The genomic DNA contained at the point of divergence an almost perfect direct repeat of 43 bp (rr in Fig. 1B). The junction with the E. coli sequences was precisely between the repeats, suggesting that the repeat was responsible for the recombination. The 5′ end of the gene was obtained by inverted PCR with the 2.5-kbp Asp718 fragment indicated by the genomic blot (Fig. 2A). It also contained no introns. The deduced protein CrRLK1 (Fig. 3) contained 803 AA (calculated size 90.2 kDa). Its predicted domain structure followed the definition of the RLK type kinases (2Braun D.M. Walker J.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 70-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar): a hydrophobic N-terminal putative signal peptide, a large N-terminal region that is thought to be extracytoplasmic, a putative hydrophobic membrane-spanning stretch of 24 AA followed by a membrane transfer-stop signal (31Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1496-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar), and a C-terminal kinase catalytic domain with all 11 subdomains described for protein kinases (20Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2296) Google Scholar). The highest similarity scores for the kinase domain (58% and 54% identity, respectively) were obtained with the Lycopersicon pimpinellifolium kinases Pto (32Martin G.B. Brommonschenkel S.H. Chunwongse J. Frary A. Ganal M.W. Spivey R. Wu T. Earle E.D. Tanksley S.D. Science. 1993; 262: 1432-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar) and Fen (33Martin G.B. Frary A. Wu T. Chunwongse J. Brommonschenkel S.H. Earle E.D. Tanksley S.D. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1543-1552PubMed Google Scholar); interestingly, these do not belong to the RLK class because they consist of little more than the catalytic kinase domain (Fig. 3). The identity scores between the catalytic domain of CrRLK1 and those of the other RLKs were 35-42%, and these values appear to be typical (2Braun D.M. Walker J.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 70-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). CrRLK1 revealed 14 putative N-glycosylation sites, and 11 were located in the N-terminal domain (Fig. 3). This distribution is characteristic for RLK, and there is evidence that they are glycoproteins (34Schaller G.E. Bleecker A.B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 450 AA of CrRLK1 revealed no similarity to the extracellular regions in the S-domain type RLK, it contained no leucine-rich repeats or similarities to the EGF-like class RLK, and it also revealed no relation to pathogenesis-related proteins or lectins. CrRLK1 therefore represents a novel RLK type. Initial attempts to express the cDNA-encoded protein in E. coli failed because no transformants were obtained, and this indicated that the protein was toxic to the bacteria. We therefore constructed fusion proteins in which the maltose-binding protein (MBP) from E. coli was fused in-frame with various parts of the kinase cDNA. The constructs are summarized in Fig. 1C. These fusions had no obvious toxic effect on E. coli, and they also had the advantage that they could be purified by affinity chromatography for autophosphorylation assays. Most of the experiments characterizing the autophosphorylation properties were performed with MCPK0 (Fig. 1C). The results in the standard assay with 10 mM divalent cations showed that the autophosphorylation was completed after about 35-45 min (Fig. 4A), and, therefore, 25-min incubations were used routinely. The autophosphorylation with MnCl2 was about 10-fold higher than with MgCl2, and no activity was observed with CaCl2 (Fig. 4B). About half-maximal activity was reached with 0.5-0.75 mM MnCl2 (Fig. 4D), and a linear increase was observed with MgCl2 up to the highest concentration tested (Fig. 4E). The temperature dependence revealed the highest values at 37°C and no activity at 0°C (Fig. 4C). The kinase used ATP at about a 5-fold higher rate than GTP, and unlabeled GTP inhibited the autophosphorylation with labeled ATP (not shown). The autophosphorylation with ATP revealed half-maximal rates at 2-2.5 μM ATP (Fig. 4F). The question of whether the protein phosphorylated strictly itself (intramolecular) and/or other kinase molecules (intermolecular) was investigated with the purified MBP-fusion proteins described in Fig. 1C. Fig. 5 shows the stained proteins used in the assays (A) and the autoradiographies of the phosphorylated proteins (B). MCPK0 (126 kDa, complete cDNA-encoded protein) and MCPK1 (86 kDa, only the catalytic domain) were both active in autophosphorylation (lanes 1 and 2), and there was no obvious difference between the two proteins. MCPK1* was a mutant in which the essential Lys (Lys-499 in the complete protein) in the phosphotransfer site of MCPK1 had been mutagenized to Arg, and the protein was inactive (lane 3). This protein was then co-incubated with MCPK0 to test whether the active kinase phosphorylated the inactive mutant. The result showed no significant phosphorylation of MCPK1* (lane 5, the weak band at 80 kDa is a degradation product from MCPK0, see lanes 1 and 6). The same result was observed in the combination of MCPK1 (active) with MCPK0* (inactive mutant) (not shown). The kinase also did not trans-phosphorylate MCPK2 (98 kDa) that contained the N-terminal part of the kinase plus a small part of the catalytic domain (lane 6); as expected, this protein did not autophosphorylate (lane 4). Other experiments (not shown) confirmed the finding with MCPK2 that the MBP-part of the fusion proteins was no substrate for the kinase. The two active kinase fusions (MCPK0, MCPK1) both produced radioactive bands in co-incubations (lane 8), indicating that they did not hinder each other in activity. In summary, these results showed that the C. roseus kinase predominantly performed an intramolecular autophosphorylation, and an intermolecular phosphorylation of other kinase molecules was only detectable after very long exposures. The results after total hydrolysis of both MCPK0 and MCPK1 and subsequent analysis of the radioactive AA showed that the autophosphorylation was mostly on Thr (80%) and much less in Ser residues (20%), and radioactive Tyr was not detectable. MCPK0 was used to identify the region of the protein that was autophosphorylated. The radioactive protein was treated with formic acid to cleave between Asp and Pro residues, and the fragments were separated by electrophoresis. Fig. 6A shows that most of the radioactivity was in a 14.1-kDa polypeptide. Counting from the N-terminal, the MCPK0 protein sequence indicated that polypeptides of 34.6 (MBP-part), 26.1 (partly MBP), 6.5, 41.2, 3.7, and 14.1 kDa were to be expected from the formic acid cleavage. Due to the large size differences, the labeled 14.1-kDa peptide could be unambiguously located to the C-terminal of the kinase, more precisely to the region containing the subdomains X and XI of the kinase catalytic domain and the C-terminal end of the protein (see Fig. 3, the cleavage site is marked with DP). Most of the other radioactive polypeptides could be explained as partial digests containing the 14.1-kDa peptide. The exception was a 32.6-kDa protein (Fig. 6A) that could represent the sum of the 26.1- and the 6.5-kDa peptides, and this suggested a low level of phosphorylation at the N-terminal. The 14.1-kDa peptide was isolated, and the analysis after total hydrolysis demonstrated about 90% of the radioactivity in Thr, the rest in Ser, and none in Tyr (Fig. 6B). The 14.1-kDa peptide contained four Thr residues (positions 720, 734, 767, and 795 in CrRLK1; marked by T in Fig. 3). All four were mutagenized in MCPK0 individually to Ala to investigate their role in the autophosphorylation. Assays with the affinity-purified proteins showed that the Thr-720 mutant was nearly inactive (Fig. 7B), although the protein was present in the same amount as the unmodified protein (Fig. 7A). Only long exposures of the film revealed a clear radioactive band, but it was too weak to attempt an identification of the phosphorylated AA. It may represent the Ser autophosphorylation that was detected after total hydrolysis of MCPK0. The mutated DNA was completely resequenced, but no other differences from MCPK0 were detected, indicating that the single Thr-720 → Ala exchange was responsible for the effect. The other Thr mutants were not significantly affected in autophosphorylation, except for the Thr-795 mutant that showed a somewhat weaker activity (Fig. 7B). The ability of the proteins to phosphorylate other polypeptides was tested with β-casein, and Fig. 7C shows that the Thr-720 mutant was incapable of phosphorylating this substrate. The other proteins did not reveal such drastic effect, except that the Thr-767 mutant showed an approximately 5-fold increase in β-casein phosphorylation (Fig. 7C). These results identified Thr-720 in the subdomain XI of the catalytic kinase domain as a residue important for both auto- and substrate phosphorylation, and they showed that Thr-767 influenced the extent of substrate phosphorylation. The C. roseus protein belongs to the RLK group of plant kinases that has attracted much attention recently because of the likely roles in the perception and transduction of external signals (2Braun D.M. Walker J.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 70-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The ligands and the receptor-function, however, have not yet been demonstrated, and the physiological roles are in most cases a matter of speculation. CrRLK1 is no exception, and its function in metabolism remains to be explored. The molecular data indicate a single copy gene that is expressed at very low levels under all conditions that have been tested so far. The absence of introns is unusual, and the only other known example for an RLK gene is ZmPK1, a S-locus type RLK from maize (35Zhang R. Walker J.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 1171-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). All other RLK genes contain 1 (36Song W.-Y. Wang G.-L. Chen L.-L. Kim H.-S. Pi L.-Y. Holsten T. Gardner J. Wang B. Zhai W.-X.

Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The only other RLK investigated in detail (RLK5 from A. thaliana) used predominantly trans-phosphorylation, suggesting that oligomerization may play a role in activation (10Horn M.A. Walker J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1208: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The experiments with RLK5 also employed fusion proteins (with MBP and glutathione S-transferase), and therefore it seems very unlikely that a different approach was responsible for the difference to CrRLK1. The two RLK5 fusion proteins had very similar apparent Km values for ATP (17.8 and 15.2 μM), suggesting that the MBP or the glutathione S-transferase parts of the proteins had no differential effect on the enzyme activity. The experiments with the C. roseus MBP-fusion indicated half-maximal rates at 2-2.5 μM ATP, and the higher affinity is likely to reflect one of the differences between intra- and intermolecular phosphorylation. This property is interesting because it suggests that CrRLK1 activation does not require oligomerization. A higher autophosphorylation activity with Mn2+ than with Mg2+ has also been described for other RLK (10Horn M.A. Walker J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1208: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 34Schaller G.E. Bleecker A.B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but the significance in vivo is not clear. The preferential phosphorylation of Thr residues was also reported for a Leu-rich (37Chang C. Schaller G.E. Patterson S.E. Kwok S.F. Meyerowitz E.M. Bleecker A.B. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and a S-domain type RLK (41Goring D.R. Rothstein S.J. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), but a generalization is not possible because a preference for Ser was described for other RLK of the S-domain type (42Stein J.C. Nasrallah J.B. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 1103-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The results with the Thr-720 → Ala mutant suggest that this Thr is the autophosphorylated residue. It should be noted, however, that it is not possible at this point to rigorously exclude the possibility that Thr-720 is necessary for these activities, but is not phosphorylated itself. The exchanges of the other Thr residues had no such drastic effects on autophosphorylation. However, complex roles in the regulation of enzyme activity are possible, as shown with the Thr-767 mutant that revealed a drastic stimulation of β-casein phosphorylation (Fig. 7C). The Ser autophosphorylation remains to be investigated, but this will be difficult because it is very low and because of the high abundance of Ser residues in the protein. The complete loss of β-casein phosphorylation with the Thr-720 mutant suggests that Ser autophosphorylation plays a minor role, if any, in the phosphorylation of other proteins. This is the first identification of a residue in a plant kinase that is important for auto- and substrate phosphorylation. The other plant RLK do not contain a Thr in the position corresponding to Thr-720 in CrRLK1, but the most closely related kinases (Pto and Fen from tomato) do have a Thr (Fig. 8). These do not belong to the RLK group because they contain not much more than the catalytic kinase domain, but they may be membrane-anchored via a myristyl residue (43Rommens C.M.T. Salmeron J.M. Baulcombe D.C. Staskawicz B.J. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 249-257PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, these proteins also predominantly autophosphorylated on Thr residues (44Loh Y.-T. Martin G.B. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 1735-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but a further characterization is not available. The EST (expressed sequence tag) data base contained three partial putative plant kinase sequences with about 50% identity to the C-terminal of Pto, Fen, and CrRLK1, and these also had a Thr at the same position (Fig. 8). It would be interesting to see whether the proteins belong to one of the known RLK types. Remarkably, all of the related proteins contain a Ser at the position of Thr-734 (end of subdomain XI) in CrRLK1 in a region that is otherwise highly conserved (Fig. 8). A possible functional significance of these similarities remains to be elucidated. We are grateful to G. Lurz for competent technical assistance."

The <i>in vitro</i> incubation of β-apo-8′, β-apo-12′-, and β-apo-14′-carotenoic acids gave rise to shorter chain β-apocarotenoic acids as well as retinoic acid. The rate of retinoic acid synthesis from 10 μMβ-apo-8′, β-apo-12′-, and β-apo-14′-carotenoic acids was 11 ± 2, 18 ± 3, and 30 ± 7 pmol/h/mg of protein, respectively. The stepwise oxidation of β-apocarotenoic acid in mitochondria was dose-related to both protein concentration and substrate concentration. β-Apocarotenoic acid oxidation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner when it was co-incubated with oleoyl-CoA. The <i>in vivo</i> perfusion of ferret liver with β-apo-8′-carotenoic acid resulted in a linear increase in the retinoic acid concentration of bile, which was completely abolished by co-perfusion of 3-mercaptopropionic acid, an inhibitor of long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and partially inhibited by 2-tetradecylglycidic acid, an inhibitor of carnitine-palmitoyl-CoA transferase I. However, the formation of retinoic acid from the β-apocarotenoic acids was not inhibited, either <i>in vitro</i> or <i>in vivo</i>, by citral, an inhibitor of retinal oxidase. Thus, the formation of retinoic acid was not occurring by the central cleavage pathway. These data suggest that the oxidation of intermediate compounds between β-carotene and retinoic acid may undergo a type of β-oxidative process to form retinoic acid, which is reminiscent of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation. This pathway may play an important role in the biosynthesis of retinoic acid from β-carotene."

We found that conversion of zymogen VII to VIIa led to an increase in affinity (ΔΔG = 4.3-4.4 kJ/mol) for TFs. Dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethyl ketone (DNS-EGRck) treatment of VIIa led to a further increase in the affinity (ΔΔG = 7.3-12 kJ/mol).

Therefore, TF may preferentially bind to the active conformational state of VIIa. When one assumes that free VIIa exists in equilibrium between minor active and dominant zymogen-like inactive conformational states, preferential binding of TF to the active state leads to a shift in equilibrium.

The deduced amino acid sequence of the full-length house fly cytochrome b5 (134 residues) is 48% identical to that of rat microsomal cytochrome b5. The house fly cytochrome b5 protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized. Absorption and EPR spectroscopy reveal properties very similar to cytochromes b5 from vertebrates. NMR spectra indicate that the orientation of the heme in the protein relative to its α,γ meso axis is about 1:1. A redox potential of −26 mV versus standard hydrogen electrode was measured by cyclic voltammetry on a modified gold electrode in the presence of hexamminechromium(III) chloride. The cytochrome b5 is reduced by house fly cytochrome P450 reductase in a reconstituted system at a high rate (5.5 s−1), and it stimulates heptachlor epoxidation when reconstituted with house fly cytochrome P450 reductase, cytochrome P450 6A1, phospholipid, and detergent. Cytochrome b5 decreases the apparent Km for P450 reductase and increases the Vmax for heptachlor epoxidation at constant cytochrome P450 6A1 concentrations. The results indicate that cytochrome b5 stimulates a step following the first electron transfer during cytochrome P450 6A1 turnover."

The results indicate that the c-Abl kinase function is involved in the growth arrest response induced by these and certain other genotoxic agents.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTreatment of NIH3T3 cells with Ara-C is associated with activation of the c-Abl kinase (26Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Ren R. Feller S. Mayer B. Zon L. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30278-30281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To determine whether the activation of c-Abl by genotoxic drugs is associated with growth arrest, we prepared MCF-7 cells that stably express a dominant negative, kinase-inactive c-Abl (K290R) mutant (12Sawyers C.L. McLaughlin J. Goga A. Havilik M. Witte O. Cell. 1994; 77: 121-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Treatment of control MCF-7/pSR cells with ara-C was associated with increases in c-Abl kinase activity (Fig. 1A). By contrast, there was no detectable c-Abl activity in untreated or ara-C-treated MCF-7/c-Abl(K-R) cells (Fig. 1A). Other studies have demonstrated that c-Abl binds to p53 in vitro (14Goga A. Liu X. Hambuch T.M. Senechal K. Major E. Berk A.J. Witte O.N. Sawyers C.L. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 791-799PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, we asked whether ara-C induces an interaction between c-Abl and p53 in vivo. As a control, we also prepared cells that express the human papillomavirus E6 protein to promote degradation of p53 (24Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3429) Google Scholar). The MCF-7/E6 cells responded to ara-C with induction of c-Abl activity (Fig. 1A). In coimmunoprecipitation studies, there was no detectable p53 in the c-Abl immunoprecipitates from control MCF-7/pSR cells (Fig. 1B). However, binding of c-Abl and p53 was detectable when MCF-7/pSR cells were treated with ara-C for 1 h (Fig. 1B). The association of c-Abl and p53 was also increased by treatment of MCF-7/c-Abl(K-R), but not MCF-7/E6, cells with ara-C (Fig. 1B). These findings indicated that ara-C induces a c-Abl-p53 interaction independent of the c-Abl kinase function. Treatment of MCF-7/pSR and MCF-7/c-Abl(K-R) cells with ara-C was also associated with increases in p53 expression, while there was no apparent effect of this agent on p53 levels in MCF-7/E6 cells (Fig. 1C). As transcription of p21 is regulated by p53 (27El-Deiry W. Tokino T. Velculescu V. Levy D. Parsons R. Trent J. Lin D. Mercer W. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7890) Google Scholar), the MCF-7/pSR and MCF-7/c-Abl(K-R), but not the MCF-7/E6, cells responded to ara-C with induction of p21 expression (Fig. 1C). p21 is an inhibitor of Cdk2 (27El-Deiry W.

However, while p21 was induced in both MCF-7/pSR and MCF-7/c-Abl(K-R) cells and was bound to Cdk2 in both cell types (data not shown), Cdk2 activity was down-regulated by ara-C treatment in only the MCF-7/pSR cells (Fig. 1D).As observed with ara-C, MMS exposure resulted in increased c-Abl activity in the MCF-7/pSR and MCF-7/E6, but not the MCF-7/c-Abl(K-R), cells (Fig. 2A). MMS increased binding of c-Abl and p53 in MCF-7/pSR and MCF-7/c-Abl(K-R), but not MCF-7/E6, cells (Fig. 2B). MMS also induced the expression of p53 and p21 in only the MCF-7/pSR and MCF-7/c-Abl(K-R) cells (Fig. 2C). The MMS-induced increases in p21 levels were associated with binding of p21 to Cdk2 (Fig. 2D). However, while Cdk2 activity was down-regulated in MMS-treated MCF-7/pSR cells, there was little effect of MMS on Cdk2 activity in the MCF-7/c-Abl(K-R) cells (Fig. 2E).Fig. 2MMS induces the formation of c-Abl-p53 complexes and down-regulation of Cdk2 by a c-Abl-dependent mechanism. MCF-7/pSR, MCF-7/c-Abl(K-R), and MCF-7/E6 cells were treated with MMS. A, nuclei were isolated at 1 h and anti-Abl immunoprecipitates were analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 1. B, lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Abl (left) or anti-p53 (right), and the precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. C, lysates were immunoblotted with anti-p53, anti-p21, and anti-PCNA. D, lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Cdk2. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-p21 (top) and anti-Cdk2 (bottom). E, lysates obtained at the indicated times were immunoprecipitated with anti-Cdk2. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by histone H1 kinase assay (top) and immunoblotting with anti-Cdk2 (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The role of c-Abl in genotoxic drug-induced growth arrest was assessed by the ability of MMS to decrease populations of S phase cells. The number of MCF-7/pSR cells in S phase at 9 h after MMS treatment was 67% of that obtained for untreated cells (Table I). By contrast, MMS-treated MCF-7/c-Abl(K-R) cells exhibited partial inhibition of the G1 response with an S phase population after treatment of over 80% of that for untreated cells (Table I). Similar findings were obtained with two independently isolated MCF-7/c-Abl(K-R) clones, while the G1 arrest response was almost completely abrogated in the MCF-7/E6 cells (Table I). These findings suggest that, as found for the down-regulation of Cdk2, c-Abl kinase activity is involved in MMS-induced G1 arrest by a p53-dependent mechanismTable IMMS induces p53-mediated G1 arrest by c-Ab1-dependent mechanismsTransfectantS phase cellsControlTreatedTreated/Control%MCF-7/pSR38.8 ± 3.226.2 ± 2.867.5MCF-7/c-Abl (K-R)Clone a38.4 ± 3.932.2 ± 4.683.9Clone b37.9 ± 3.030.6 ± 2.880.7MCF-7/E636.6 ± 4.834.5 ± 3.194.3 Open table in a new tab To substantiate the link between c-Abl and DNA damage-induced growth arrest, we studied the effects of MMS on mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient in c-Abl (Abl−/−) (30Tybulewicz V.L.J. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). Wild type MEFs responded to MMS with induction of the c-Abl kinase, while there was no detectable c-Abl activity or protein in MMS-treated Abl−/− cells (data not shown). Both wild type and Abl−/− MEFs responded to MMS with increases in p53 and p21 levels (Fig. 3A). These findings indicated that c-Abl is not necessary for DNA damage-induced increases in the transactivation function of p53. However, despite induction of p21 in both cell types, Cdk2 activity was significantly down-regulated in MMS-treated wild type, but not Abl−/−, MEFs (Fig. 3B). Wild type MEFs also responded to MMS with G1 arrest. The number of wild type MEFs in S phase at 9 h after MMS treatment was 51% of that obtained for untreated cells (Fig. 3C). By contrast, MMS-treated Abl−/− cells had an S phase population which was 71% of that for untreated cells (Fig. 3C). These findings suggest that c-Abl is involved in the down-regulation of Cdk2 and that the G1 arrest response involves mechanisms other than activation of p21.Fig. 3Effects of MMS on down-regulation of Cdk2 activity and growth arrest in Abl-deficient cells. C57Bl/6 wild type (Abl+/+) and Abl−/− MEFs were treated with MMS. A, lysates obtained at the indicated times were immunoblotted with anti-p53, anti-p21, and anti-PCNA.

Similar findings have been obtained with the genotoxic topoisomerase inhibitors camptothecin and etoposide (data not shown) and with ionizing radiation exposure (25Yuan Z.M. Huang Y. Whang Y. Sawyers C. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Nature. 1996; 382: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Thus, diverse types of DNA damage activate c-Abl (17Kharbanda S. Ren R.

J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30278-30281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and the interaction of c-Abl with p53. However, the finding that c-Abl binds to p53 following treatment of the MCF-7/c-Abl(K-R) cells with genotoxic agents indicates that activation of the c-Abl kinase is not necessary for the interaction. Moreover, the demonstration that expression of p53 and p21 is increased in MMS-treated MCF-7/c-Abl(K-R) and Abl−/− cells suggests that c-Abl is not necessary for inducing certain transactivation functions of p53 following genotoxic stress. Conversely, the findings that c-Abl is activated by DNA-damaging agents in MCF-7/E6 and p53−/− (data not shown) cells indicates that p53 is dispensable for c-Abl activation.The present results also indicate that activation of the c-Abl kinase is necessary for the complete G1 arrest response to genotoxic drugs. Induction of p21 expression and binding of this Cdk inhibitor to Cdk2 by genotoxic stress is insufficient for the complete down-regulation of Cdk2. Rather, our findings indicate that induction of c-Abl kinase activity is also involved in the down-regulation of Cdk2 and growth arrest. Recent work has shown that overexpression of kinase active, but not inactive, c-Abl in p21−/− fibroblasts is associated with down-regulation of Cdk2 and growth arrest (25Yuan Z.M. Huang Y. Whang Y. Sawyers C. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Nature. 1996; 382: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In concert with these results is the demonstration that p53-dependent events can inhibit cell growth through p21-independent mechanisms (31Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar, 32Hirano Y. Yamato K. Tsuchida N. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1879-1885PubMed Google Scholar, 33Brugarolas J. Chandrasekaran C. Gordon J.I. Beach D. Jacks T. Hannon G.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings indicate that genotoxic agents induce the down-regulation of Cdk2 and G1 arrest by a mechanism dependent on activation of c-Abl kinase and binding of c-Abl to p53, but independent of p21. INTRODUCTIONThe c-abl gene encodes a ubiquitously expressed nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that is primarily localized to the nucleus. The c-Abl SH3 domain binds to Abl interactor (Abi) proteins 1 and 2 (1Shi Y. Alin K. Goff S.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2583-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 2Dai Z. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2569-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The finding that the SH3 domain of c-Abl also binds constitutively to the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHPTP1 has supported the existence of distinct nuclear c-Abl pools (3Kharbanda S. Bharti A.

The carboxyl-terminal region of c-Abl contains a nuclear localization signal (4Van Etten R.A. Jackson P. Baltimore D.

More recent work has suggested that the cytostatic effect of c-Abl requires both p53 and the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein (15Wen S.-T. Jackson P.K. Van Etten R.A.

The involvement of c-Abl in cell cycle control has also been supported by the finding that c-Abl is phosphorylated by p34cdc2 and that such modification inhibits DNA binding (5Kipreos E.T.

https://openalex.org/W2046869263,"The anaerobic bacterium Peptostreptococcus magnus is a human commensal and pathogen. Previous work has shown that strains of P. magnus isolated from patients with gynecological disease (vaginosis) frequently express an immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain-binding protein called protein L. Here we report that strains isolated from localized suppurative infections bind human serum albumin (HSA), whereas commensal isolates bind neither Ig nor HSA. The HSA-binding protein PAB was extracted from the bacterial surface or isolated from the culture supernatant of the P. magnus strain ALB8. Protein PAB was shown to have two homologous HSA-binding domains, GA and uGA. GA is absent in the sequence of a related protein from another P. magnus strain and shows a high degree of homology to the HSA-binding domains of streptococcal protein G. Therefore GA is believed to have recently been shuffled as a module from genes of other bacterial species into the protein PAB gene. This GA module was shown to exhibit a much higher affinity for HSA than uGA and was also found to be present in all of the isolates tested from localized suppurative infections, indicating a role in virulence. Moreover, when peptostreptococci or streptococci expressing the GA module were grown in the presence of HSA, the growth rate was substantially increased. Thus, the HSA binding activity of the GA module adds selective advantages to the bacteria, which increases their virulence in the case of P. magnus strains.

As a rule, anaerobic infections are caused by bacteria that are part of the indigenous flora of mucosal surfaces and the skin. Peptostreptococcus magnus is such a commensal, and it belongs to the major group of anaerobic bacterial species causing clinically significant infections (1Bourgault A.-M. Rosenblatt J.E. Fitzgerald R.H. Ann. Intern. Med. 1980; 93: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Still little is known about the virulence factors of this bacterium. Increased oxygen tolerance, as seen among clinical P. magnus isolates, could contribute to the pathogenic potential (2Ezaki, T., Oyaizu, H., Yabuuchi, E., (1992) The Prokaryotes, (Balows, E., Trüper, H.

J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1194-1197PubMed Google Scholar). Protein L has been shown to be a virulence determinant in bacterial vaginosis (15Kastern W. Holst E. Nielsen E. Sjöbring U. Björck L. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 1217-1222Crossref Google Scholar), perhaps due to its histamine-releasing activity (16Patella V. Casolaro V. Björck L. Marone G. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3054-3061PubMed Google Scholar). M proteins contribute to the virulence of S. pyogenes by their antiphagocytic property (17Fischetti V.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 2: 285-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), and also IgGFc-binding proteins of these bacteria have been reported to be virulence factors (18Reader R. Boyle M.D.P. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3696-3702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments with deletion mutants have likewise shown that protein A of S. aureus plays a role in virulence, possibly by inhibiting opsonophagocytosis (19Foster T.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 118: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). human serum albumin polymerase chain reaction phosphate-buffered saline polyvinylidene difluoride polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis free fatty acids N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. Host protein binding cell wall proteins of Gram-positive bacteria share common primary structure motifs, including (from the distal NH2 terminus) a signal sequence, a variable NH2-terminal region, a varying number of repeated domains that independently bind different plasma proteins, and a proline-rich region supposedly intercalating the protein in the Gram-positive cell wall, followed by a COOH-terminal cell wall sorting signal required to anchor the protein to the cell wall (20Schneewind O. Model P. Fischetti V.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 267-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The gene structure of the albumin-binding protein PAB has been shown to contain a centrally located functional domain of 45 amino acid residues responsible for the binding of HSA (Fig. 1). This domain has been subject to module shuffling between bacterial species, and was subsequently named the GA module, protein G-related albumin binding module (13de Château M. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12147-12151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such shuffling of modules seems to be a persistent activity among this group of genes, and when a consensus sequence of 15 nucleotides (called recer sequence) flanking the different modules in the P. magnus family of surface proteins was identified, a model for the shuffling of modules was proposed (21de Château M. Björck L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8490-8495Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The albumin-binding protein G of group G streptococcal strain G148 carries three GA modules in the NH2-terminal part of the protein showing up to 60% identity to the shuffled module of protein PAB, indicating that protein G might be the source of the GA module in protein PAB. The secondary structure and global fold of the GA module in protein PAB have been determined by NMR and were shown to adopt a 3-helix bundle (22Johansson M.U. de Château M. Björck L. Forsén S. Drakenberg T. Wikström M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the third GA module of protein G was recently shown to exhibit the same structure (23Kraulis P.J. Jonasson P. Nygren P.-Å. Uhlén M. Jendeberg L. Nilsson B. Kördel J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The predecessor of protein PAB has also been identified. This protein, called urPAB, is expressed by a strain that binds less albumin to its surface. Protein urPAB lacks the shuffled GA module (21de Château M. Björck L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8490-8495Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but in the NH2-terminal region, a domain (uGA) was identified showing 38% identity to the GA module. Likewise, sequence comparison between proteins urPAB and PAB revealed an analogous uGA domain in protein PAB, thus indicating the presence of a second HSA-binding region in protein PAB (Fig. 1). HSA binding has been described for a number of additional surface proteins of group C and G streptococci as well as for a P. magnus protein that, in addition to several GA modules, also contains Ig light chain-binding domains closely related to those of protein L (24Sjöbring U. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3601-3608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Murphy J.P. Duggleby C.J. Atkinson M.A. Trowern A.R. Atkinson T. Goward C.R. Mol.

Gene (Amst.). 1994; 143: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27Jonsson H. Lindmark H. Guss B. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2968-2975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from the HSA-binding proteins of S. pyogenes that belong to the M protein family, the other HSA-binding proteins all contain GA-related sequences. In the case of M proteins, the binding of HSA is located to the so-called C repeats (10Åkesson P. Schmidt K.-H. Cooney J. Björck L. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 11Retnoningrum D.S. Cleary P.P. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2387-2394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which show no homology to the GA module, suggesting that these structures have evolved separately. The aims of the present study were to further characterize the HSA binding properties of protein PAB, to localize its HSA-binding regions, and to compare the affinities of the shuffled GA module with that of the uGA domains, i.e. the NH2-terminal HSA-binding domains of proteins PAB and urPAB. It was believed that this information could help to explain why the GA module has been shuffled into protein PAB. The biological consequences of HSA binding have also been investigated, and the results demonstrate that essential properties such as bacterial growth and virulence are affected by the interaction with albumin. P. magnus strains were clinical isolates from the Department of Clinical Microbiology, Lund University Hospital. The peptostreptococci were grown under strict anaerobic conditions at 37°C in Todd-Hewitt broth (Difco). HSA and human IgG were purified from human plasma (28de Château M. Nilson B.H.K. Erntell M. Myhre E. Magnusson C.G.M. Åkerström B. Björck L. Scand. J. Immunol. 1993; 37: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Other serum albumins and sera were from Sigma. Protein L was prepared from peptostreptococcal growth medium (15Kastern W. Holst E. Nielsen E. Sjöbring U. Björck L. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 1217-1222Crossref Google Scholar), and recombinant protein G was from Escherichia coli lysates (9Björck L. Kastern W. Lindahl G. Widebäck K. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 1113-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Proteins were radiolabeled with 125I using the Bolton-Hunter reagent (Amersham Corp., Buckinghamshire, Great Britain), chloramine T, or lactoperoxidase. Bacteria were suspended, heat killed (80°C, 5 min), and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.02% NaN3 and 0.5% Tween 20. Bacterial suspensions of different concentrations in a volume of 100 μl were mixed with 900 μl of Staphylococcus epidermidis strain L603 (109 bacteria/ml). 200 μl of these mixed bacterial suspensions were then incubated with 104 cpm of 125I-labeled HSA or IgG for 30 min. Cells were spun down, and the radioactivity of the pellet was measured in a γ counter and expressed as percentage of added radioactivity. Peptostreptococci were grown as described until the stationary phase was reached and then harvested by centrifugation. Subsequently, 10% solutions of the bacteria were boiled in HCl, pH 2.0, or NaOH, pH 11.0, vortexed in PBS, and treated with mutanolysin or trypsin to extract surface proteins. Acid and alkali extractions were performed by boiling the bacteria for 3 min in 0.1 M HCl or NaOH, whereafter the sample was neutralized by the addition of 0.1 volume of 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Extraction was done by vortexing the bacterial suspension in PBS. Mutanolysin digestions were performed in 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and blocked with NaHCO3 to pH 7.5 and by cooling on ice. Trypsin digestions were done at pH 6.1 in 0.05 M phosphate buffer containing 5 mM EDTA. Reactions were inhibited by adding benzamidine to a final concentration of 5 mM. Enzyme incubations were at 37°C for 1-2 h. Culture medium from peptostreptococci (strain ALB8) expressing protein PAB or periplasmic E. coli lysates of clones expressing the 5′-end (nucleotides 1-857) of the protein PAB gene (pab) were used as starting materials and subjected to affinity chromatography on HSA-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). Columns of Sepharose, coupled with 3-5 mg of HSA/ml of packed gel, were equilibrated in PBS. The sample, in 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, was applied, and the column was rinsed with PBS and then eluted with 0.1 M glycine buffer, pH 2.0. Eluates were immediately neutralized by the addition of 0.1 volume of unbuffered 1 M Tris. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and transferred to PVDF membranes (30Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Agarose gel electrophoresis was performed as described (31Johansson B.G. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. Suppl. 1972; 29: 7-19Crossref Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Transfer of proteins from agarose gels was done by applying PVDF membranes on top of the gels under pressure (1-2 kg). P. magnus bacteria of strain 312 (109 cells) were incubated in 1 ml of human plasma for 2 h at 37°C. The cells were spun down and washed five times in PBS. The bacterial pellet was then resuspended in 50 μl of PBS and boiled in an equal volume of SDS sample buffer. Cell debris was spun down, and the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (9Björck L. Kastern W. Lindahl G. Widebäck K. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 1113-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Equilibrium constants were determined by incubating constant amounts of Immunobeads (Bio-Rad), coupled with HSA, together with 125I-labeled protein PAB or GA and varying amounts of non-labeled proteins for 16 h at room temperature. After washing, the amount of bound radioactivity was measured. Using the formula of Scatchard, the calculations were done as previously reported (32Åkerström B. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19740-19746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 10% (v/v) solutions of strain ALB8 peptostreptococci were incubated for 2 h at 37°C with mutanolysin in 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. The reaction was blocked with NaHCO3 to pH 7.5 followed by cooling on ice. Cells were spun down, and material from the supernatant was applied to PVDF membranes using a dot blot apparatus from Schleicher & Schuell (Dassel, Germany). Incubation with radiolabeled HSA was followed by autoradiography to visualize binding. Five oligonucleotides were synthesized, all of which include restriction site linkers (NarI and SalI) for cloning in the expression vector pHD 389 (33Dalböge H. Bech Jensen E. Töttrup H. Grubb A.

These oligonucleotides were used as primers with genomic DNA from P. magnus strains ALB8 and ALB1B as templates to generate inserts for cloning. PCR products were purified by chloroform/phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation and were subjected to restriction enzyme cleavage before a second purification and ligation to the vector. Subsequently, the ligation mixes were transformed into competent E. coli strain JM109 cells. Clones were selectively grown on ampicillin-containing plates and were screened by PCR and for expression of HSA binding peptides. HSA binding peptides were then purified by affinity chromatography on HSA-Sepharose and on a gel chromatography column, Superose 12 for fast protein liquid chromatography (Pharmacia). The purification of the GA module has also been described elsewhere in more detail (22Johansson M.U. de Château M. Björck L. Forsén S. Drakenberg T. Wikström M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA was isolated from 15 HSA-binding strains of suppurative infections and from 10 non-binding, non-pathogenic isolates. These chromosomal preparations were used as templates in PCRs using the following oligonucleotides as primers: RX2N, dTTA AAG AAC GCT AAA GAA GAT GCA AT; 769, dGCT ACC AGC TTT TGG TAA. Forty-eight P. magnus strains were isolated from patients with localized suppurative infections (n = 30) or vaginosis (n = 8). Ten commensal isolates were from healthy carriers. The ability of these strains to bind HSA and human IgG was tested (Fig. 2). Among the 30 suppurative infection isolates, 16 (53%) were HSA binding, whereas only one isolate showed significant IgG binding. In the vaginosis group, on the other hand, five of the eight isolates bound IgG and none bound HSA. Finally, neither HSA nor IgG binding activity could be detected among the commensal isolates. Thus, when the group of strains causing suppurative infections was compared with the commensal strains, there was a significant difference in the prevalence of HSA binding as tested with the χ2 test (p < 0.0001), implying a role for protein PAB in virulence. The binding capacity of the HSA-binding strains was shown to be saturable and varied among the strains between 15 and 71% as tested by direct binding of radiolabeled HSA to bacterial cells (Fig. 3). Among the HSA-binding strains, strain ALB8 showing maximal binding (70%) and strain ALB1B showing intermediate binding (27%) were chosen for further isolation and characterization of the HSA-binding proteins PAB and urPAB, respectively.Fig. 3Binding of radiolabeled HSA to different strains of P. magnus. The binding of 125I-labeled HSA to six different strains of P. magnus was measured at bacterial concentrations varying from 105 to 109/ml. Strain 312 (♦) expresses protein L, ALB8 (▴) protein PAB, and ALB1B protein urPAB (∘). Albumin-binding strains ALB15 (•) and ALB18 (⋄), as well as the non-binding strain 505 (□), are also included.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) After anaerobic growth of P. magnus strain ALB8 bacteria for 3 days in Todd-Hewitt broth, cells were collected by centrifugation and washed in PBS. Different procedures to solubilize HSA binding materials were tested. Boiling of the bacteria at low or high pH in HCl and NaOH, respectively, released substantial amounts of fragmented HSA-reactive material in the range of 14-45 kDa (Fig. 4). Similarly, degraded material could be obtained by treatment of intact bacteria with the muranolytic enzyme mutanolysin, whereas trypsin digestion resulted in extensive degradation. A higher proportion of larger fragments could be obtained by simply vortexing the bacteria in PBS. Still, a full-length molecule of 47 kDa was only seen when the HSA-binding protein was isolated from the culture supernatant by affinity chromatography on HSA-Sepharose. The protein yield from the culture supernatant was approximately 1 mg/liter. The NH2-terminal sequence of this 47-kDa material has been shown to correspond to that of the NH2-terminal sequence of protein PAB as deduced from the gene sequence (13de Château M. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12147-12151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mild treatment of the material coming off the HSA-Sepharose column with trypsin resulted in a single HSA binding fragment of 23 kDa. Protein PAB-expressing bacteria were incubated with human plasma. After incubation and washing, the bacteria were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Cells were spun down, and the supernatant was run on a gel that was also blotted onto a PVDF membrane and probed with radiolabeled protein PAB. As seen in Fig. 5, only a single band at 66 kDa representing HSA could be adsorbed to the bacterial surface, and this band also reacted with protein PAB in the Western blot experiment. The conclusion is that neither the bacteria nor protein PAB will interact with any other plasma protein than HSA. Subsequent tests of the binding of 125I-labeled protein PAB to a number of purified proteins (i.e. IgG, IgA, fibrinogen, and fibronectin) in slot binding experiments were also negative (not shown). In order to further analyze the specificity of the interaction between protein PAB and HSA, human plasma was run on agarose gels. After transfer to PVDF membranes, the plasma proteins were probed with either protein L or protein PAB. As seen in Fig. 6, protein L bound to the cathodal immunoglobulin region of the plasma sample, whereas protein PAB bound to the anodal albumin region. Proteins PAB and L were also applied to the gel and were found to migrate in opposite directions to their respective ligands. These results reflect that protein PAB is a basic protein (net charge of +7, pI of 9.78), and protein L is an acidic protein (net charge of −54).Fig. 6Analysis of the interactions between peptostreptococcal proteins L and PAB and human plasmaproteins. Samples of diluted plasma and purified IgG, HSA, and proteins PAB and L were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis at pH 8.6. Two duplicates of the first three samples were also transferred to PVDF membranes and probed with radiolabeled proteins PAB and L, respectively.

The separated proteins were blotted onto a PVDF membrane and probed with radiolabeled protein PAB (Fig. 7). Binding to the albumin band in serum from man, baboon, rhesus monkey, rat, and cat was seen. Fig. 8 demonstrates that, also among purified albumins from 12 mammalian species, protein PAB has affinity for albumin from man, baboon, rhesus monkey, and rat (purified cat serum albumin was not available).Fig. 8Binding of protein PAB to albumin from different species. Dilution series (5, 1, 0.2, and 0.04 μg) of albumin from different species were applied to a PVDF membrane in slots. The membrane was probed with radiolabeled protein PAB.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) If P. magnus strain ALB8 bacteria are grown in Todd-Hewitt broth until stationary phase, HSA binding activity can be detected not only on the surface of the bacteria but also in the culture supernatant. This material can be adsorbed to HSA-Sepharose and then eluted at pH 2.0. The eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto two PVDF membranes. One was probed with radiolabeled HSA, and the results demonstrated that the majority of the bands still bound HSA (not shown). The other membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue, and as seen in Fig. 9, the HSA binding material coming off of the column is often size heterogeneous. This could be due to partial hydrolysis at low pH or due to proteolytic activity at the bacterial surface or in the culture medium. The albumin binding bands at 47 (I), 24 (II), and 16 kDa (III) were cut out and subjected to NH2-terminal sequencing. All three bands had the same amino acid sequence, identical to the absolute NH2 terminus of protein PAB. This shows that the fragments are derived from protein PAB and that there must be an HSA-binding site in the most NH2-terminal 130-140 amino acids, giving an approximate molecular mass of 16 kDa. The same material was then subjected to mild trypsin treatment, yielding a single major albumin-binding protein species at 23 kDa (IV). The NH2-terminal sequence of this fragment was MTIDQ which corresponds to the five amino acid residues at positions 213-217 of protein PAB. This sequence is found immediately in the NH2-terminal direction of the GA module. From this, a second albumin-binding region in protein PAB is implied as fragments III and IV do not overlap. In the region of protein PAB covered by fragment I, at positions 57-101, a region exhibiting 42% identity to the GA module has been found. This GA-related domain was designated uGA since its counterpart was found in the same position in the protein PAB predecessor, protein urPAB (Fig. 1) (21de Château M. Björck L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8490-8495Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To show that the recently introduced GA module contributes to the pathogenicity of the HSA-binding strains causing localized suppurative infections, 25 different P. magnus strains were tested for the presence of the GA module. Chromosomal DNA from the different strains was used as templates in polymerase chain reactions. An oligonucleotide (RX2N) representing the 5′-end of the recently introduced GA module of protein PAB and a second oligonucleotide spanning the very well conserved cell wall anchor motif (769) were used as primers in these reactions. DNA from the protein PAB strain, which was used as a positive control, yielded a product of approximately 450 base pairs. All 15 HSA-binding strains yielded products of equal or near equal (±100 base pairs) sizes, whereas none of the 10 non-binding strains yielded any PCR products with these primers. To find an explanation to why a second GA module has been introduced into protein PAB, the affinity of this GA module was determined and compared with the relative affinities of the uGA regions of proteins PAB and urPAB. Recombinant fragments of proteins PAB and urPAB covering the three resident GA modules were expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography on HSA-Sepharose, followed by gel filtration. Fragment AC corresponds to amino acid residues 27-195 of protein PAB, containing the uGA and C domains. A second fragment (GA) covers residues 213-265 of protein PAB containing the GA module, whereas uGA-K is a fragment corresponding to the uGA region (positions 1-102) of protein urPAB (Fig. 1). These fragments together with proteins urPAB and G were run on a Tricine-SDS-PAGE gel to show sizes and purity (Fig. 10A). They were also radiolabeled and allowed to bind to HSA in slot binding experiments (Fig. 10B). In these experiments, the AC fragment bound weakly, the GA module bound almost as strong as intact protein PAB (compare with Fig. 8), and the uGA-K bound to an intermediate degree. A competitive binding assay was utilized to determine the equilibrium constant of the interactions between HSA and fragment GA of protein PAB, as well as the relative affinities of the three peptostreptococcal GA modules. The affinity of fragment GA (the shuffled module) for HSA was determined to be 6.7 × 109M−1. Furthermore, HSA was coupled to polyacrylamide beads and incubated with the radiolabeled GA fragment in the presence of different amounts of non-labeled competing proteins (Fig. 10D). The AC fragment could only interfere with the binding of radiolabeled GA when added at a molar excess of >1000:1. Protein urPAB was a much more efficient inhibitor but still not as efficient as GA itself. Based on the amount of inhibitor needed to elicit th"

Gq GAP activity is characteristic of intact PLC-βs. In reconstituted phospholipid vesicles that contained purified Gq and m1 muscarinic cholinergic receptors, the most active tails increased agonist-stimulated, steady-state GTPase activity over 4-fold. Stimulation of steady-state GTPase by the tails depended on receptors for facilitation of GDP-GTP exchange, suggesting that the tails act by accelerating hydrolysis of bound GTP. In addition to intrinsic GAP activity, one tail with high GAP activity and others with low or minimal activity potentiated the GAP activity of intact PLC-β1. Other tails inhibited PLC-β1s GAP effect. Both intrinsic GAP activity and potentiation of the PLC-β1 GAP effect were often biphasic, with maxima as low as 100 nM tail and declining activities at higher concentrations. Several tails inhibited either the phospholipase activity of PLC-β1, its stimulation by Gq, or both. The tails thus define the region of PLC-β1 that has Gq GAP activity and suggest a mechanism of action in which the COOH terminus of PLC-βs can interact with Gq and with other PLC-β1 molecules."

Subsequent characterization of the purified PelC mutant proteins demonstrated that pectinolytic function involves amino acids located near the calcium binding site rather than those surrounding an invariant vWiDH sequence. Wild-type PelC and the tested mutant proteins generally macerated plant tissue in proportion to their specific pectinolytic activity in vitro. However, some mutants gave higher maceration activity in plant tissue and elicited greater production of the phytoalexin, glyceollin, in soybean cotyledons than predicted by their in vitro pectinolytic activity. Most notable in this regard were three different mutations at lysine 172 with greatly reduced pectinolytic activity but as much elicitor activity as the wild-type protein. PelE macerated plant tissue 10 times more efficiently than PelC, as observed previously, but surprisingly showed equal activity in the elicitor assay. The results indicate that factors other than pectinolytic activity per se are involved in plant tissue maceration and elicitor activity.

https://openalex.org/W2047747423,"Enterobacteriaceae contain genes for three separate ribonucleotide reductases: nrdAB code for a class Ia enzyme, active during aerobiosis, nrdDG for a class III enzyme, active during anaerobiosis, and nrdEF for a cryptic class Ib enzyme. The NrdEF enzyme provides the active reductase in other, widely different bacteria. Here, we describe the allosteric regulation of the Salmonella typhimurium NrdEF enzyme. It consists of two tightly bound homodimeric proteins, R1E and R2F. Nucleoside triphosphates (ATP, dATP, dGTP, and dTTP) regulate the substrate specificity by binding to a single site of the R1E protein (one nucleotide per polypeptide). Regulation is similar to that of the NrdAB enzyme, with one major exception: dATP stimulates reduction of CDP (and UDP) under conditions when dATP strongly inhibits all activity of the NrdAB enzyme. The nrdA-coded R1 protein contains a second binding site for dATP (and ATP) that controls general enzyme activity. All known R1E proteins lack the 50 N-terminal amino acids of R1, and we propose that the activity site is located in this area of the protein.

The more sophisticated regulation of NrdAB enzymes of eukaryotes provides protection against the possibly harmful overproduction of dNTPs. The history of ribonucleotide reductases is full of surprises. A recent example is the discovery of the nrdEF genes that code for a third reductase in enterobacteriaceae (1Jordan A. Gibert I. Barbé J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3420-3427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two other ribonucleotide reductases were earlier known to exist in Escherichia coli: an aerobic class I enzyme, coded by the nrdAB genes (2Fontecave M. Nordlund P. Eklund H. Reichard P. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1992; 65: 147-183PubMed Google Scholar), and the more recently found anaerobic class III enzyme, coded by nrdDG (3Reichard P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9410-9416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The third enzyme is also a class I enzyme, but its amino acid sequence and some of its properties (5Jordan A. Pontis E. Atta M. Krook M. Gibert I. Barbé J. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12892-12896Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) distinguish it from the previously known E. coli ribonucleotide reductase. In enterobacteriaceae, the new enzyme is poorly expressed, but recent work (6Yang F. Lu G. Rubin H. J.

It now appears that in bacteria an active NrdAB-type reductase only is found in E. coli and related organisms, whereas other bacteria maintain an active NrdEF enzyme. Eukaryotes contain the NrdAB enzyme. We have suggested a subdivision of class I, with the NrdAB enzymes forming class Ia and the NrdEF enzymes forming class Ib (8Jordan A. Pontis E. Åslund F. Hellman U. Gibert I. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8779-8785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). All class I enzymes are constructed from two homodimeric proteins called R1 and R2 for class Ia and R1E and R2F for class Ib (8Jordan A. Pontis E. Åslund F. Hellman U. Gibert I. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8779-8785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 9Reichard P. Science. 1993; 260: 1773-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). R1 and R1E contain substrate binding and allosteric sites, R2 and R2F contain a oxygen-linked di-iron center and a stable tyrosyl radical, required for catalytic activity. The iron center participates together with oxygen in the generation of the radical (2Fontecave M. Nordlund P. Eklund H. Reichard P. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1992; 65: 147-183PubMed Google Scholar). Class I enzymes thus depend on molecular oxygen for their activity. R2 (R2F) provides the tyrosyl radical, but it is used by R1 (R1E) to activate the substrate that is bound in the catalytic cleft (10Uhlin U. Eklund H. Nature. 1994; 345: 533-539Crossref Scopus (513) Google Scholar) and reduced by two strategically placed redox-active cysteines (10Uhlin U. Eklund H.

A. 1989; 86: 1485-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All ribonucleotide reduction involves radical chemistry and requires a protein-bound radical for substrate activation. A second group of reductases (= class II) substitutes adenosylcobalamin for R2 as radical generator (13Blakley R.L. Barker H.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1964; 16: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Booker S. Stubbe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8352-8356Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Class II enzymes consist of a single protein that functions similar to R1 of class I enzymes. The radical generating mechanism then no longer depends on the presence of oxygen, and ribonucleotide reduction occurs equally well under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. A third group of ribonucleotide reductases (= class III) generates an oxygen-sensitive glycine radical from S-adenosylmethionine (3Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8383-8386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Class III enzymes consist of two homodimeric proteins (4Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Gaillard J. Eliasson R. Fontecave M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9410-9416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), similar to class I reductases, and again employ the small protein for radical generation. However, this protein contains an iron-sulfur cluster in place of the oxygen-linked di-iron center. Class III enzymes operate only during anaerobiosis. All three classes of enzymes have one property in common: a single protein reduces the four common ribonucleoside di- or triphosphates (9Reichard P. Science. 1993; 260: 1773-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Substrate specificity is determined by nucleoside triphosphates acting as allosteric effectors (15Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 39-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 16Chen A.K. Bhan A. Hopper S. Abrams R. Franzen J.S. Biochemistry. 1977; 13: 654-661Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17Eliasson R. Pontis E. Sun X. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26052-26057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of ATP makes the enzymes reduce CDP and UDP, dGTP favors ADP reduction, and dTTP favors GDP reduction. These effects are similar for all three classes. This is not the case for dATP. With enzymes belonging to class Ia (15Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 39-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), excepting virus-coded reductases, and class III (17Eliasson R. Pontis E. Sun X. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26052-26057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), dATP is a general inhibitor. Enzymes belonging to class Ib (5Jordan A. Pontis E. Atta M. Krook M. Gibert I. Barbé J. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12892-12896Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and II (16Chen A.K. Bhan A. Hopper S. Abrams R. Franzen J.S. Biochemistry. 1977; 13: 654-661Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) are not inhibited. Instead, dATP stimulates the reduction of CDP and UDP. The mechanism giving rise to these effects has been investigated in some detail for the E. coli class Ia (15Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 39-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and III (17Eliasson R. Pontis E. Sun X. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26052-26057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reductases. In the former case, the effector nucleotides were found to bind to R1 at two distinct sites, one each per protomer. One site binds either ATP, dATP, dGTP, or dTTP and determines the specificity of the enzyme (= substrate specificity site). The second site binds only ATP or dATP and determines the overall activity of the enzyme (= activity site). With ATP bound to this site, the enzyme is active; with dATP bound, it is inactive. Also, the large protein of class III enzymes contains two distinct effector binding sites (17Eliasson R. Pontis E. Sun X. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26052-26057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One binds dGTP, dTTP, and dATP and regulates the reduction of purine substrates, the second binds dATP and ATP and regulates pyrimidine substrates. At both sites, dATP binding turns off the enzyme, whereas binding of the other nucleotides is activating: ATP stimulates CDP and UDP reduction, dGTP stimulates ADP reduction, and dTTP stimulates GDP reduction. The physiological net effect is thus the same as with class Ia enzymes. As mentioned above, class Ib enzymes behave differently from class Ia and III enzymes in that they are not inhibited by dATP. Here, we study the Salmonella typhimurium class Ib reductase (5Jordan A. Pontis E. Atta M. Krook M. Gibert I. Barbé J. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12892-12896Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) to determine the reason for this. We demonstrate that this enzyme also reduces the four common ribonucleotides and that its substrate specificity is allosterically regulated. Our results suggest that the lack of inhibition by dATP is due to the absence of an activity site that can bind this nucleotide. The large (R1E) and small (R2F) proteins of the S. typhimurium Ib reductase were purified to apparent homogeneity as described (5Jordan A. Pontis E. Atta M. Krook M. Gibert I. Barbé J. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12892-12896Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). 3H- and 14C-Labeled nucleoside di- and triphosphates were obtained from Amersham Corp. or Moravek Biochemicals. They were diluted to a specific activity of between 20 and 40 cpm/pmol with the corresponding unlabeled nucleotides and purified by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex (17Eliasson R. Pontis E. Sun X. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26052-26057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlabeled nucleoside triphosphates were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. and used without further purification except for ATP. Since high concentrations of ATP were used, it was necessary to exclude also very minor contamination with dATP. To this purpose, a 50 mM solution of ATP in 1 M acetic acid was heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min. This treatment completely removed adenine from dATP but left ATP relatively intact. The acid was removed by evaporation in a vacuum, and the remaining ATP was purified by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex. 5-20% linear sucrose gradients with a total volume of 4.6 ml were prepared in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol (18Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In one experiment, nucleoside triphosphates (100 μM dATP, dGTP, or dTTP or 2 mM ATP) were also included. Proteins in a total volume of 0.2 ml were layered on top of the gradients and centrifuged in a SW 50 Beckman rotor at 30,000 rpm and 20°C for 15 h. Catalase (20 μg/tube, s20,w = 11.4 s) was added as an internal marker. At the end of the run, the tubes were punctured at the bottom, and fractions were collected and analyzed as described earlier (18Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). CDP reduction was measured by the standard method used in this laboratory (5Jordan A. Pontis E. Atta M. Krook M. Gibert I. Barbé J. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12892-12896Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The reduction of ADP, GDP, and UDP was determined by the modified procedure (16Chen A.K. Bhan A. Hopper S. Abrams R. Franzen J.S. Biochemistry. 1977; 13: 654-661Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) of Kim et al. (19Kim J.J. Abrams R. Franzen J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 182: 674-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In all experiments, R2F was used in excess of R1E (1 to 1.5 μg of each protein). Incubations were at 37°C for 20 min. One unit of enzyme activity is 1 nmol of product formed during 1 min. The method of Ormö and Sjöberg (20Ormö M. Sjöberg B-M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 182: 674-682Google Scholar) was used. Experiments were done either at +25°C or +4°C. In the latter case, all manipulations including the centrifugation step were made in a cold room. The enzyme was diluted to the desired concentration (0.1 to 1.2 mg/ml) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol (0.1 ml per experiment) and added to 0.05 ml containing the radioactive nucleotide at 1 to 30 μM in a Millipore Ultrafree-MC 30000 NMWL filter unit. A 20-μl portion was withdrawn to determine total radioactivity. After 10 min, the unit was centrifuged for 3 min at 3300 rpm in an Ole Dich type 157MP centrifuge. A 40-μl portion of the filtrate (total volume approximately 50 μl) was used to determine the radioactivity of the unbound nucleotide. The amount of bound nucleotide was obtained from the difference between the total and unbound radioactivity. The method (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) was first standardized by amino acid analysis of pure R1E and R2F, respectively. Thereafter, crystalline bovine serum albumin was routinely used as standard. The reduction of CDP required the simultaneous presence of two proteins that were separated by DEAE-chromatography early during purification of the enzyme (5Jordan A. Pontis E. Atta M. Krook M. Gibert I. Barbé J. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12892-12896Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). They were named R1E and R2F because of their relatedness to the large (R1) and small (R2) proteins of the earlier known aerobic E. coli reductase. This enzyme has an α2β2 structure formed from the homodimeric R1 and R2 proteins. We now show by sucrose gradient centrifugation that also the new reductase has such a structure. In the experiment described in Fig. 1, solutions of R1E and R2F, either alone or in combination, were centrifuged in separate tubes containing 5 to 20% sucrose gradients as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The s20,w values of the proteins were calculated from their positions in the gradient relative to a catalase marker (11.4 S). When alone (Fig. 1A), the two proteins migrated as symmetrical peaks with values of 8.2 S (R1E) and 4.8 S (R2F), as compared to reported values of 7.8 and 5.5 S for R1 and R2, respectively. In a parallel run, aldolase (Mr = 158,000) and bovine serum albumin (Mr = 67,000) gave values of 7.9 S and 4.8 S, respectively (data not shown). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that both R1E and R2F were present as dimers in solution since their monomeric molecular weights are 80,500 and 36,000, respectively. To study complex formation, we centrifuged mixtures of the two proteins, containing increasing amounts of R2F in the presence of a constant amount of R1E (Fig. 1, B-D). At the lowest concentration of R2F, with a R2F/R1E ratio of 0.9 (panel B), a single protein peak was found at 9.6 S, indicating complex formation. When the ratio was increased to 1.3 (panel C), an additional peak was found at 5 S reflecting the excess R2F in the gradient. Increasing the ratio to 1.6 (panel D) also increased the amount of R2F. These results demonstrate that R1E became saturated with R2F when the stoichiometry between the two proteins was 1:1 and indicate that the complex had an α2β2 structure. Qualitatively, these gradients look similar to those obtained earlier with R1·R2 (18Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). One difference concerns the stability of the complex. With R1·R2, there was a clear tendency to dissociate which was not as apparent with the new enzyme. The dissociation of the R1·R2 complex was decreased by inclusion of the positive effectors dTTP and ATP in the gradient. Negative effectors, such as dATP, induced formation of a heavy complex sedimenting at 15 S. When we now tested the effects of ATP, dATP, dGTP, and dTTP on the sedimentation behavior of the R1E·R2F complex, we found that their presence in the gradient did not have any demonstrable effect (data not shown). In earlier work with the new reductase, only its ability to catalyze the reduction of CDP to dCDP was demonstrated (5Jordan A. Pontis E. Atta M. Krook M. Gibert I. Barbé J. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12892-12896Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It seemed, however, likely that the enzyme is a general ribonucleotide reductase and that its substrate specificity depends on the presence of the correct positive allosteric effector, as is the case with all other known ribonucleotide reductases. In a series of experiments, we therefore investigated the reduction of ADP, GDP, and UDP in addition to that of CDP in the presence of various putative effectors with the results shown in Table I. Since the values were obtained in several separate experiments, they are given as percent of the rate found with the effector giving the highest reductionTable I.Allosteric regulation of substrate specificitySubstrateEffectorNoneATPdATPdCTPdGTPdTTP% activityADP0ND701003GDP017241839100CDP1060100ND3072UDP2090100ND4550a ND = not done. Open table in a new tab a ND = not done. The two purine substrates were not reduced at all in the absence of effectors. ADP reduction showed a very specific requirement for dGTP, with dTTP and dATP being less than 10% active. Furthermore, the activity with dTTP and dATP required concentrations of the nucleotides that were at least 10-fold higher than the optimal concentration of dGTP. GDP reduction was optimal with dTTP, but also other effectors showed some activity, again, however, at considerably higher concentrations. The two pyrimidine substrates had similar effector requirements. Both showed a basal reduction in the absence of effectors. The effectors decreased the Km value for the substrate. The Km for CDP was 330 μM in the absence of effector and 20 μM in the presence of dATP (data not shown). Both pyrimidine substrates showed the best activity with dATP (“Km” for CDP reduction = 2.5 μM), followed by ATP (“Km” = 170 μM), dTTP (“Km” = 25 μM) and dGTP (“Km” = 60 μM) (data not shown). Since the curves for the determination of Km deviated slightly from linearity (see below), Km is put between quotation marks. These results are similar to those found earlier for the E. coli class Ia reductase, with the exception of dATP. Here, dATP acts as a positive effector and is actually the preferred one for the reduction of pyrimidine ribonucleotides. With the class Ia and III reductases, dATP inhibited the reduction of all ribonucleotides (15Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 39-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 17Eliasson R. Pontis E. Sun X. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26052-26057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism through which a given effector promotes the reduction of a specific substrate, we tested the influence of dTTP or dATP on the reduction of ADP in the presence of dGTP. As shown in Table I, dGTP is by far the best effector for the reduction of ADP, but dATP and dTTP also show minor stimulatory effects. In the experiment depicted in Fig. 2, we measured the dependence of ADP reduction on the concentration of dGTP, either alone or in the presence of a fixed amount of dATP or dTTP. The data are represented as Lineweaver-Burk plots. With dGTP alone, the curve is nonlinear with a slight upward bend indicating cooperativity. This behavior was found consistently in three separate experiments. It is not possible to calculate a Km value from such a curve. As a substitute, we measured the concentration of dGTP at half-maximal velocity. This value is 5 μM with dGTP alone and 10 μM in the presence of either 50 μM dATP or 100 μM dTTP. The three curves intersect at the ordinate (Fig. 2) indicating competition between dGTP and dATP (dTTP) for the same site on the enzyme. We will return to this experiment under “Discussion.” Binding of dATP, dGTP, and dTTP to R1E could be demonstrated and quantitated, whereas ATP binding was too weak to be measured. R2F alone did not bind any nucleotide but, as shown below, influenced binding to R1E. In Fig. 3, data for binding of the three deoxynucleoside triphosphates are given as Scatchard (22Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-675Crossref Scopus (17815) Google Scholar) plots. Panels A-C show the binding of dATP, dTTP, and dGTP to R1E alone, panel D shows the binding of dGTP to R1E in the presence of an excess of R2F. For dATP and dGTP, binding curves at both 4 and 25°C are given in panels B and C, respectively. Binding of dTTP (panel A) was too weak to permit experiments at the higher temperature. The following general conclusions can be drawn from the results: (i) the curves are nonlinear, indicating cooperativity; (ii) binding is 3 to 4 times stronger at the lower temperature; (iii) dGTP shows the highest affinity, followed by dATP, followed by dTTP; (iv) at least for dGTP, the presence of R2F decreases the affinity of R1E for the nucleotide; (v) extrapolation of the curves to the abscissa gives in all cases a number of approximately 2 molecules of dNTP bound per dimer of R1E. We next asked the question whether the different nucleotides occupy the same binding site. We carried out two sets of experiments, both measuring competition between nucleotides for binding to R1E alone. In the first, we chased bound dATP from the enzyme with an excess of a competing nucleotide; in the second we determined the effect of the competing nucleotide on the binding of increasing concentrations of dGTP. In the first experiment, a main objective was to determine if the competing nucleotide could chase dATP completely from both binding sites. The data shown in Table II show that this is the case for dGTP and dTTP, but not for ATP. ATP only moderately decreased dATP binding, even though the concentration of ATP was 100-fold higher than that of dATP.

The data are given as reciprocal plots of dGTP concentration versus binding of dGTP in order to show that increasing concentrations of dGTP overcome the inhibition by each of the nucleotides. In this case, ATP also gave a competitive behavior. The cooperative binding behavior prevents a designation of simple Kdiss values for the various effectors. Estimates of the values at which half of the sites are occupied give the following μM concentrations: dGTP = 0.12; dATP = 1; dTTP = 3; ATP = approximately 500. In enterobacteriaceae the function of the NrdEF enzymes is not known. In these bacteria, the NrdAB enzymes are exclusively responsible for deoxyribonucleotide production, and conditional mutations in the nrdAB genes are not complemented by the resident chromosomal nrdEF genes. Both E. coli and S. typhimurium have maintained in their genomes the potential to produce active NrdEF proteins, apparently without using it. However, NrdEF enzymes are used for the production of deoxyribonucleotides by other bacteria (6Yang F. Lu G. Rubin H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6738-6743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Fraser H.C. et al.Science. 1995; 270: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar, 8Jordan A. Pontis E. Åslund F. Hellman U. Gibert I. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8779-8785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The characterization of these enzymes and an understanding of the differences between the two subgroups of class I reductases is therefore of considerable interest. The present work concerns the substrate specificity and allosteric properties of the S. typhimurium NrdEF proteins and by extrapolation those of other class Ib ribonucleotide reductases. We show that again a single enzyme is able to catalyze the reduction of each of the four common ribonucleotides and that its specificity is modulated by nucleoside triphosphate. The enzyme is a ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase, and, thus, modulators and substrates have different levels of phosphorylation. This also applies to class Ia enzymes, but not to most class II and class III enzymes, where both substrates and modulators are triphosphates. In the present case, there can be little doubt that the modulators bind to sites on the enzyme that are distinct from the substrate binding site and that the observed changes in substrate specificity are of an allosteric nature. They probably occur through subtle conformational changes at that part of the catalytic site that is responsible for the binding of the purine and pyrimidine moiety of the substrate. Thus, binding of dGTP to the allosteric site induces at the substrate binding site the appropriate conformation to bind the adenine moiety of ADP, dTTP binding gives the best fit for the guanine moiety of GDP, and dATP (ATP) binding the best fit for the pyrimidine of CDP or UDP. This model is strongly supported by the results of Fig. 2 that demonstrate a competitive inhibition of the positive effect of dGTP on ADP reduction by dTTP or ATP. The latter two effectors induce conformations of the enzyme that favor GDP or CDP reduction and therefore suppress the reduction of ADP. It is a remarkable fact that on the whole the same results are found with all three classes of reductases, even though their amino acid sequences show little homology. The close similarity in allosteric behavior points to a common ancestor from which all ribonucleotide reductases have inherited the mechanism for the regulation of substrate specificity (9Reichard P. Science. 1993; 260: 1773-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Its presence in all classes indicates that this allosteric mechanism was invented early during evolution. One difference between class Ia and Ib concerns the effect of dATP. In both cases, low concentrations of dATP stimulate the reduction of pyrimidine ribonucleotides. However, increasing the concentration of dATP above 1 μM inhibits class Ia (15Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 39-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) but not class Ib enzymes. Inhibition depends on the presence of a second binding site for dATP (activity site). One R1 polypeptide of class Ia can bind two molecules of dATP, each with different affinities, and binding of the second dATP inhibits the enzyme. We now find that one R1E polypeptide of class Ib only can bind one dATP and that this binding occurs at the substrate specificity site. Thus, class Ib lacks the activity site of class Ia. The R1E proteins from all class Ib reductases known so far lack the 50 to 60 N-terminal amino acids of the R1 proteins of class Ia. We suggest that the activity site of class Ia is located in this part of the molecule. In support of this is the finding that a D57N mutation in the mouse R1 protein makes the enzyme insensitive to inhibition by dATP (23Caras I.W. Martin D.W.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 2698-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows our model for effector binding to the R1E protein of class Ib. Each protein monomer has only one binding site, and all effectors (dGTP, dATP, dTTP, and ATP) bind to this identical site. This becomes evident from the competition experiments of Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5 and Table II. dNTPs are bound with a much higher affinity than ATP, the difference between dGTP (highest affinity) and ATP being more than 1000-fold. Binding is stronger at lower temperature and in the absence of the R2F protein. Binding is cooperative as indicated from the curvatures of the Scatchard plots. The explanation for this is probably that R1E as a dimer binds two molecules of effector and that binding of the first molecule increases the affinity for the second molecule. Also shown in Fig. 5 are the earlier proposed models for R1 (class Ia) and for the large protein of the anaerobic class III E. coli reductase (15Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 39-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 17Eliasson R. Pontis E. Sun X. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26052-26057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both have two allosteric binding sites per monomer. R1 has one site that can accommodate only ATP or dATP, and binding of dATP to this site inhibits the enzyme, whereas ATP binding stimulates it. We have therefore called this site activity site. It is absent from R1E. The second site on R1 that binds ATP, dATP, dGTP, and dTTP corresponds to the single binding site on R1E and regulates the substrate specificity. None of the two binding sites of the large protein of the anaerobic class III reductase is an “activity site” in the sense of the R1 protein. dATP is a negative effector when bound to either site, but ATP counteracts its effect only at one of them (pyrimidine site). At the other (purine site), dTTP and dGTP, but not ATP, compete with dATP (Fig. 5). The final outcome is nevertheless that dATP is a general negative effector of the enzyme. The difference in binding behavior explains why class Ib enzymes are not inhibited by dATP and therefore lack a general negative control of ribonucleotide reduction that turns off the enzyme when dNTPs accumulate. Also, class II enzymes do not have this type of control which therefore does not exist in most prokaryotes. Eukaryotic cells employ class Ia enzymes and therefore have a more sophisticated ribonucleotide reductase that protects them from the possible toxic and mutagenic effects that may arise from the overproduction of dATP and other dNTPs (24Kunz B.A. Kohalmi S.E.

The amount of phosphatidylinositol synthase is not affected by the presence of inositol and choline in the growth medium.

We found that expression of the PIS1 gene was reduced when cells were grown in a medium containing glycerol and increased when grown in a medium containing galactose relative to cells grown in a glucose medium.

How cells respond to environmental changes has been the subject of intense investigation. In procaryotes, the two-component regulatory system is a well defined and recurring mechanism. The two-component regulatory systems include a sensor and a response regulator that modulate gene expression in reaction to changes in the environment (1Parkinson J.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 857-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Even though two-component systems have been studied in procaryotes for many years, they have only recently been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H.

The major phospholipids in yeast membranes, phosphatidylinositol (PI) 1The abbreviations used are: PIphosphatidylinositolPISPI synthaseIPSinositol-1-phosphate synthasebpbase pair(s). and phosphatidylcholine, are synthesized by two branches of the phospholipid biosynthetic pathway that diverge from a common lipid precursor, CDP-diacylglycerol (8Carman G.M.

In large part, our knowledge of the regulation of phospholipid biosynthetic gene expression has evolved from studies carried out on the INO1 gene that encodes IPS (Fig. 1A). For example, IPS activity, IPS subunit amount, and INO1 transcript levels are all reduced when yeast cells are grown in the presence of inositol and choline (17Culbertson M.R. Donahue T. Henry S. J.

This pattern of regulation has also been documented for other phospholipid biosynthetic genes (CHO1, CHO2, OPI3, and CKI) that encode enzymes of the phosphatidylcholine branch of the pathway (20Bailis A.M.

The PIS enzyme is unique among the phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes because its activity is not regulated in response to inositol and choline (13Fischl A.S. Homann M.J. Poole M.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3178-3183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, immunoblot studies show that the amount of the 34,000-Da subunit of PIS is unaffected by inositol (13Fischl A.S. Homann M.J. Poole M.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3178-3183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This lack of effect on PIS activity and subunit amount appears to be due to a lack of regulation at the transcriptional level (23Kodaki T. Hosaka K. Nikawa J.-I. Yamashita S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 109: 276-287PubMed Google Scholar). These observations are surprising because the PIS1 promoter does contain a potential UASINO element that matches the consensus UASINO element in 8 of 10 base pairs (see Fig. 1B). In this study, we found that expression of the PIS1-lacZ fusion gene was unresponsive to inositol in a wild type strain and insensitive to ino2 and opi1 mutations. Instead, expression of the PIS1 and PIS1-lacZ genes was regulated in response to different carbon sources. This regulation required the MCM1 and SLN1 genes and two Mcm1p-binding sites (MCE) present in the PIS1 promoter. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Yeast cultures were grown at 30°C in synthetic media (33Kelly B.L. Greenberg M.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Where appropriate, galactose or glycerol (2% v/v) was substituted for glucose. β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (24Lopes J.M. Hirsch J.P. Chorgo P.A. Schulze K.L. Henry S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1687-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Units of β-galactosidase activity were defined as (A420/min/mg of total protein) × 1000. Protein concentration in each extract was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Promoter fusions to the lacZ reporter gene were created by inserting restriction fragments from the PIS1 promoter into YEp357R (34Meyer A.M. Tzagoloff A. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 45: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Each construct used an EcoRI site to fuse the four amino-terminal amino acids from PIS1 (Fig. 1B) in-frame with the lacZ gene. Plasmid pMA109 was constructed using a 960-bp EcoRI-EcoRI restriction fragment from pPI514 (14Nikawa J.-I. Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4876-4881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, pMA107 contained a 629-bp HindIII-EcoRI restriction fragment and pMA108 contained a 134-bp XhoI-EcoRI fragment (Fig. 1B). Plasmid pMA101 was generated for the purpose of synthesizing a PIS1 cRNA probe to be used in Northern and slot blot hybridizations. This plasmid was constructed by subcloning a 996-bp EcoRI fragment from pPI514, containing the entire PIS1 coding sequence (14Nikawa J.-I. Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4876-4881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), into pGEM1. RNA was isolated from yeast using a glass bead disruption and hot phenol extraction (35Elion E.A. Warner J.R. Cell. 1984; 39: 663-673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). RNA probes (cRNA) for Northern and slot hybridizations were synthesized using the Gemini II core system (Promega) from plasmids linearized with a restriction enzyme and transcribed with an RNA polymerase as follows (plasmid/restriction enzyme/RNA polymerase): pMA101/SalI/T7 (PIS1) and pPLg/BamHI/SP6 (ACT1) (kindly provided by C. Steber and R. E. Esposito, University of Chicago). Northern blot hybridizations were performed as described previously (19Hirsch J.P. Henry S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3320-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and results were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by densitometry. Slot blots were performed as described previously (19Hirsch J.P. Henry S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3320-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, a more sensitive slot blot procedure, involving formaldehyde denaturation, was used to assay the PIS1 transcript. For this modified slot blot procedure, total cellular RNA was dissolved in 100 μl of a denaturing solution (6% formaldehyde, 30 mM NaPO4, pH 6.8, 1 M NaCl) (36Lawther R.P. Lopes J.M. Ortuno M.J. White M.C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2320-2327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mixture was heated to 65°C for 5 min prior to transferring to Nytran. The presence of a UASINO-like element in the PIS1 promoter (Fig. 1B) suggested that PIS1 transcription might be regulated by the cognate regulatory genes, INO2 and OPI1 (8Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 635-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. Broach J. Jones E. Pringle J. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Vol 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 415Google Scholar, 10Greenberg M.L. Lopes J.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine this possibility, PIS1-lacZ expression was examined using a fusion of 926 bp of the PIS1 promoter to lacZ (pMA109). The wild type (BRS1001) and opi1 (BRS1021) mutant strains were grown in I−C− (lacking inositol and choline) and I+C+ media (containing 75 μM inositol and 1 mM choline). The ino2 mutant strain (BRS2001) had to be grown in the presence of inositol (I+C+) because it is an inositol auxotroph. Expression of the PIS1-lacZ fusion gene in the wild type strain (BRS1001) was unresponsive to the presence of inositol in the growth media (Fig. 2A). The PIS1-lacZ gene was expressed at a higher level (3.6-fold) in the ino2 mutant strain (BRS2001) than in the wild type strain (Fig. 2A). This phenotype is unusual because strains containing ino2 mutant alleles express repressed levels of the phospholipid biosynthetic genes, INO1 and CHO1 (19Hirsch J.P. Henry S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3320-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 20Bailis A.M. Poole M.A. Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Expression of the PIS1-lacZ reporter gene was unaffected in the opi1 mutant strain (BRS1021). Again, this observation is unusual since opi1 mutant strains constitutively overexpress the phospholipid biosynthetic genes, INO1 (19Hirsch J.P. Henry S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3320-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), CHO1 (20Bailis A.M. Poole M.A. Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), CHO2 (37Jackson J.C. Lopes J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1322-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and OPI3 (37Jackson J.C. Lopes J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1322-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These data indicate that PIS1 expression is independent of the major phospholipid regulatory circuitry. One possibility for the lack of effect of inositol on PIS1 expression is that the function of the UASINO element present in the PIS1 promoter depended on an unorthodox combination of inositol and choline. To address this, we examined the expression of several PIS1-lacZ fusions in response to various combinations of inositol and choline. Expression of lacZ driven by PIS1 promoter constructs, that included the putative UASINO element (pMA109 and pMA107), was unaffected by any combination of inositol and choline (Fig. 2B). Expression of the PIS1-lacZ gene from a deletion construct (pMA108) lacking the UASINO element was increased 2-fold when cells were grown in the presence of inositol and choline (Fig. 2B). These experiments suggest that the putative UASINO-like element present in PIS1 promoter does not function in the same capacity as the UASINO elements present in the promoters of the other phospholipid biosynthetic genes (8Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 635-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. Broach J. Jones E. Pringle J. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Vol 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 415Google Scholar, 10Greenberg M.L. Lopes J.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined if PIS1 gene expression was affected by growth in media containing different carbon sources. This line of inquiry was suggested by the observation that the PIS1 promoter binds Mcm1p (38Kuo M.-H. Grayhack E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 348-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and because Mcm1p is a target of the Gal11 regulatory protein that is involved in carbon source regulation of gene expression (39Yu G. Fassler J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Expression of the PIS1 gene was quantitated by slot blot hybridization of total cellular RNA (normalized using an ACT1-specific probe) from a wild type strain (BRS1001). RNA was purified from this strain grown in complete synthetic media containing 75 μM inositol and either 2% glucose, 2% galactose, or 2% glycerol. The amount of the PIS1 transcript increased 51% when cells were grown in galactose and reduced 53% when grown in glycerol relative to growth in a glucose medium (Fig. 3). Since the MCEs in the PIS1 promoter were known to bind Mcm1p (38Kuo M.-H. Grayhack E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 348-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this raised the possibility that MCM1 may regulate PIS1 expression in response to the carbon source. To address this, we tested the effect of a temperature-sensitive mcm1 mutant allele on PIS1 gene expression. A strain harboring an mcm1ts mutant allele (C2-110L) (6Elble R. Tye B.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10966-10970Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and an isogenic wild type strain (C2-2μMU) were grown at 30°C in media containing either 2% glucose, 2% galactose, or 2% glycerol. Upon reaching midlog phase, half of each culture was maintained at 30°C (permissive), while the other half was shifted to 37°C (restrictive). The cultures were allowed to grow for an additional 4 h prior to isolating RNA. Expression of the PIS1 transcript was assayed by quantitative slot blot hybridization and normalized to the ACT1 transcript. In the C2-2μMU wild type strain, PIS1 transcript levels were similar to those described for the BRS1001 wild type strain (compare Fig. 3, Fig. 4A). That is, growth in galactose yielded a slight increase in expression, whereas growth in glycerol yielded a significant decrease in expression. This pattern of expression was conserved in the C2-110L strain (mcm1ts) grown at 30°C (Fig. 4B). However, the shift to the restrictive temperature had a significant impact on PIS1 transcription in the mcm1ts strain (C2-110L) when grown in glycerol. Under these conditions, there was a 110% increase in PIS1 transcription relative to cells grown at 30°C (Fig. 4B). It should be noted that there was substantially greater standard deviation observed with the mcm1ts mutant strain (C2-100L) relative to the wild type strain (C2-2 μMU). This increase in standard deviation was due to differences between colonies. That is, the pattern of expression in the three growth conditions (Fig. 4B) was identical for each colony. SLN1 is a two-component regulator (2Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 3Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. Science. 1993; 262: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 4Brown J.L. North S. Bussey H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6908-6915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that modulates Mcm1p activity (7Yu G. Deschenes R.J. Fassler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8739-8743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To determine if expression of the PIS1 gene is a downstream target in the SLN1 regulatory pathway, we examined the effect of an sln1 mutant allele on native PIS1 transcription. Expression of the PIS1 gene was quantitated from wild type (JF819) and sln1 mutant (JF1359) strains grown in media containing inositol and either 2% glucose, 2% galactose, or 2% glycerol (Fig. 5). Transcription of the PIS1 gene was reduced 34% in an sln1 mutant strain (JF1359) relative to the wild type strain (JF819) when cells were grown in the glucose medium (Fig. 5). There was also a modest increase in the level of PIS1 expression in the sln1 mutant strain when cells were grown in the galactose medium, but there was no effect when grown in the glycerol medium (Fig. 5). We also examined the effect of the sln1 mutant allele on expression of the PIS1-lacZ fusions (Fig. 6). The full-length promoter fusion (pMA109), in the wild type strain (JF819), was expressed at high amounts in the glucose and galactose media (99 and 235 units, respectively) and reduced to 44 units of activity in the glycerol medium. In the sln1 mutant strain (JF1359), expression from the full-length promoter fusion (pMA109) was decreased 44% when grown in the glucose medium. This result is consistent with the effect of the sln1 mutant allele on expression of the native PIS1 gene (Fig. 5). Analysis of the pMA107 construct, which lacks 331 bp relative to pMA109, yielded an interesting result. There was a 57% decrease in expression in the sln1 mutant strain (JF1350) relative to the wild type strain when cells were grown in the galactose medium (Fig. 6A). This suggests that the SLN1 gene product is a positive regulator of PIS1 gene expression in response to galactose. Deletion of the two MCEs (pMA108) resulted in much higher levels of expression of the PIS1-lacZ fusion in all three carbon sources (Fig. 6C). There was an approximately 5-fold increase in expression when pMA108 transformants were grown in either glucose or galactose media relative to pMA109 transformants. However, the sln1 mutation had even more dramatic effect on lacZ expression from pMA108 (28-fold) when cells were grown in glycerol medium (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that the region that contains the MCEs (HindIII to XhoI) must include a general repressor element as well as a glycerol-specific repressor element. We report an analysis of the regulation of PIS1 gene expression. The initial experiments examined the function of a potential UASINO element in the PIS1 promoter. The data showed that the UASINO element present in the PIS1 promoter was not functional in its native context (Fig. 2). Expression of the PIS1-lacZ reporter gene (Fig. 2) was unresponsive to inositol and choline supplementation and unaffected by mutations in the INO2 and OPI1 regulatory genes (Fig. 2). It was necessary to examine if PIS1 expression was affected by the ino2 and opi1 mutants because of recent reports of UAS elements that utilize some of these regulatory genes to bring about constitutive gene expression (40Ashburner B.P. Lopes J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1709-1715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Swift S. McGraw P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1426-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 42Li Z. Brendel M. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, PIS1 is the only phospholipid biosynthetic gene whose expression is not co-regulated with that of the other genes in the pathway (8Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 635-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. Broach J. Jones E. Pringle J. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Vol 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 415Google Scholar, 10Greenberg M.L. Lopes J.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of a nonfunctional UASINO element in the PIS1 promoter is curious. However, the lack of regulation of PIS1 gene expression in response to inositol is logical since the product of the PIS1 gene utilizes inositol as a substrate (13Fischl A.S. Homann M.J. Poole M.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3178-3183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of UASINO function may be explained by the two base deviations relative to the consensus sequence (5′ CATATGAAGT 3′ compared with 5′ CATGTGAAAT 3′). But it is equally conceivable that the PIS1 version of the UASINO element may be functional in some other physiological context. For example, it is noteworthy that removal of the UASINO element increased expression of the PIS1-lacZ reporter gene by a factor of 2 when grown in the presence of inositol and choline (Fig. 2B). Coincidentally, expression of the PIS1-lacZ gene was also increased 3.6-fold when an ino2Δ mutant strain was grown in the presence of inositol and choline (Fig. 2A). Thus, the PIS1 UASINO element may function in a different capacity than the consensus UASINO element. The most novel finding was that PIS1 gene expression was responsive to the carbon source. The PIS1 gene is the first phospholipid biosynthetic gene shown to be subject to regulation in response to different carbon sources. The particular pattern of regulation is also unusual. For most yeast genes subject to carbon source-mediated regulation, glucose is usually the repressing condition, and galactose is the inducing condition (43Johnston M. Carlson M. Broach J. Jones E. Pringle J. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Vol 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 193Google Scholar). However, in the case of the PIS1 gene, glycerol is the repressing condition (Fig. 3). The only other systems that have been described where gene expression is lowered by growing cells in a nonfermentable carbon source (i.e. glycerol, ethanol, or acetate) are the ribosomal protein genes (44Papciak S.M. Pearson N.J. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1992; 234: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and genes encoding glycolytic enzymes (45Butler G. McConnell D.J. Curr. Genet. 1988; 14: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 46Chamber A. Tsang J.S.H. Stanway C. Kingsman A.J. Kingsman S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5516-5524Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 47Denis C.L. Ferguson J. Young E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1165-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Nishizawa M. Araki R. Teranishi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism for regulation of glycolytic gene and ribosomal protein gene expressions is likely to be different from the mechanism controlling PIS1 gene expression. It has been shown that glycolytic gene expression and ribosomal protein gene expression are controlled by a UAS element that dictates glucose inducibility. The mechanism regulating PIS1 expression is likely to involve a repressor-mediated mechanism since removal of promoter sequences (such as the MCEs) yielded increased expression in the presence of glycerol rather than reduced expression in the presence of glucose (Fig. 6). Regulation of PIS1 expression by carbon sources may coordinate PI biosynthesis with macromolecular synthesis (e.g. ribosome assembly). This has been previously suggested by the fact that yeast cells unable to synthesize PI die (inositol-less death) unless macromolecular synthesis is halted (49Henry S.A. Atkinson K.D. Kolat A.I. Culbertson M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 130: 472-484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data show that the MCM1 gene and MCEs are required for the glycerol-mediated repression of PIS1 gene expression. Expression of the native PIS1 gene was increased in the mcm1ts mutant strain grown in glycerol (Fig. 4B). The amount of PIS1 gene expression in glycerol-grown cells was slightly greater than the amount of expression in either glucose- or galactose-grown cells. This pattern of expression was also observed with a PIS1-lacZ fusion lacking the MCEs (pMA107 in Fig. 6C). The ability of the MCM1 gene product to function as a repressor has been described previously. It is known that the Mcm1p functions to repress an a-specific gene (STE2) in α cells in cooperation with the α2 repressor (6Elble R. Tye B.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10966-10970Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The promoter of the STE2 gene is known to include an MCE that binds Mcm1p (50Passmore S. Elble R. Tye B.-K. Genes & Dev. 1988; 3: 921-935Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In addition to the MCM1-mediated glycerol repression, there must also be a general repressor present between the HindIII and XhoI sites. This is indicated by the fact that the amount of β-galactosidase activity in the pMA108 transformants is 5-fold greater under all carbon sources compared with the amount of activity in pMA107 transformants (Fig. 6B). The carbon source regulation was also affected in an sln1 mutant strain (Fig. 6B). The data suggest that Sln1p may be a positive regulator of PIS1 expression in response to galactose. It is curious that there was no effect of the sln1 mutation on galactose-mediated expression from pMA109 (Fig. 6A) or the native PIS1 gene (Fig. 5). This suggests that there may exist regulatory elements upstream of the HindIII site that interact with Sln1p. It is possible that Sln1p galactose-mediated regulation of native PIS1 transcription occurs only under specific growth conditions. The data also showed a slight decrease in expression of the native PIS1 gene when sln1 mutant cells were grown in glucose media (Fig. 5). However, this effect was observed for all of the promoter constructs in response to almost all carbon sources (Fig. 6). Thus the glucose-dependent effect of the sln1 mutation on PIS1 expression may be an indirect consequence of the mutation. The observation that SLN1 affected expression from the PIS1 promoter in pMA108 is nevertheless significant given that the SLN1 gene encodes a regulatory protein that resembles bacterial two-component regulators (3Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. Science. 1993; 262: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and because Sln1p is a regulator of Mcm1p activity (7Yu G. Deschenes R.J. Fassler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8739-8743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Two-component regulators have been identified as a major mechanism by which bacterial cells can transduce an extracellular stimulus into a genetic response (1Parkinson J.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 857-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). However, there were no examples of a yeast two-component system with a recognized external stimulus and a target gene. Thus, the yeast PIS1 gene provides the first such example. We thank John Jackson and Kelly Robinson for insightful discussions and an anonymous reviewer for helpful suggestions. We thank Miriam Greenberg for the suggestion to examine regulation in response to the carbon source and Elizabeth Grayhack for the observation that Mcm1 interacted with the PIS1 promoter. We also thank Jan Fassler and Bik-Kwoon Tye for providing strains and discussing results prior to publication and Camille Steber and Shelley Esposito for providing plasmid pPLg."
https://openalex.org/W2066164754,"We demonstrated previously that forced expression of the neuronal phosphoprotein neuromodulin (also known as GAP-43, F1, B-50, and p57) in mouse anterior pituitary AtT-20 cells enhances depolarization-mediated secretion and alters cellular morphology. Here we analyze the role of calmodulin binding by neuromodulin in these responses. In cells expressing wild-type neuromodulin, a complex with calmodulin that is sensitive to intracellular calcium and phosphorylation is localized to the plasma membrane. Transfection of several mutant forms of neuromodulin shows that the effects of this protein on secretion are dependent on both calmodulin binding and association with the plasma membrane. In contrast, the morphological changes depend only on membrane association. Thus, the multitude of effects of neuromodulin noted in previous studies may result from divergent properties of this protein.

Taken together, these results suggest that neuromodulin plays an important role in axon elongation. Further support for this notion has been derived from studies of several cell culture model systems (19Zuber M. Goodman D. Karns L.R. Fishman M.C.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 647-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, a line of PC12 cells in which neuromodulin expression is nearly undetectable is nevertheless capable of robust neurite elongation in response to nerve growth factor (29Baetge E.E. Hammang J.P. Neuron. 1991; 6: 21-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Additionally, cultured neurons derived from mice in which the neuromodulin gene has been disrupted by gene targeting extend axons to the same extent as cells that express this protein. Further analysis of the neuromodulin (−) embryos revealed that retinal axons appear incapable of crossing the midline decision point in the optic chiasm, implying that their growth cones fail to respond to environmental guidance cues (30Strittmatter S.M. Fankhauser C. Huang P.L. Mashimo H. Fishman M.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 445-452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). These results suggest that neuromodulin is perhaps not essential for axon elongation, but rather might function as a mediator of signal transduction pathways in the growth cone that serve to modulate the rate, extent, and trajectory of axonal growth. In the adult nervous system, neuromodulin expression persists in pre-synaptic terminals in those regions where the synaptic modifications associated with learning and memory are thought to occur (31Gispen W.H.

Oestreicher A.B. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) suggest a role for neuromodulin in neuronal plasticity, possibly via modulation of neurotransmitter release. Support for this notion is derived from the demonstration that antibodies to neuromodulin that prevent its phosphorylation inhibit evoked neurotransmitter release in permeabilized synaptosomes (42Dekker L.V.

Furthermore, the levels of neuromodulin mRNA expression and neurotransmitter release are well correlated in NG108-15 cells (25Kumagai-Tohda C. Tohda M. Nomura Y. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Finally, inhibition of neuromodulin expression in PC12 cells by antisense RNA markedly diminishes depolarization-mediated secretion of noradrenaline (45Neve R.L. Ivins K.J. Benowitz L.I. During M.J.

Neuromodulin appears to interact with several second messenger systems in the growth cone and nerve terminal. The N-terminal domain of neuromodulin has been shown to stimulate GTP/GDP exchange on the α subunit of the GTP-binding proteins Go or Gi (47Strittmatter S.M. Valenzuela D. Kennedy T.E. Neer E.J. Fishman M.C. Nature. 1990; 344: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 48Strittmatter S.M. Valenzuela D. Sudo Y. Linder M.E. Fishman M.C. J. Biol.

Injection of neuromodulin or neuromodulin N-terminal peptides in cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons or Xenopus laevis oocytes enhanced G-protein-mediated intracellular signaling (50Strittmatter S.M.

Fishman M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells neuromodulin also appears to be modulate the function of L-type calcium channels, thereby affecting their electrical excitability (52Baetge E.E. Hammang J.P. Gribkoff V.K. Meiri K.F. Perspectives Dev. Neurobiol. 1992; 1: 21-28PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, as an inhibitor of the phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate kinase, neuromodulin influences the metabolism of phosphoinositides and may act therefore as a feedback inhibitor of calcium mobilization and PKC activity (53Jolles J. Zwiers H. Van Dongen C.J. Schotman P. Wirtz K.W.A. Gispen W.H. Nature. 1980; 286: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Neuromodulin was also shown recently to be ADP-ribosylated (54Coggins P.J. McLean K. Nagy A. Zwiers H. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); however, the functional significance of this is unknown. Neuromodulin has also been shown to bind to calmodulin, with a higher affinity in the absence of Ca2+ than is its presence. Calmodulin binding is also disrupted by phosphorylation of neuromodulin by the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent PKC (55Chapman E.R. Au D. Alexander K.A. Nicolson T.A. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 207-213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results have led to the hypothesis that neuromodulin serves to sequester calmodulin at the inner face of the plasma membrane in close proximity to calmodulin-dependent enzymes. Elevation of intracellular calcium would promote dissociation of calmodulin from neuromodulin, allowing the rapid activation of these substrates (56Liu Y. Storm D.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 57Estep R.P. Alexander K.A. Storm D.R. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1990; 30: 161-180Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 58Apel E.D. Storm D.R. Perspectives Dev. Neurobiol. 1992; 1: 3-11PubMed Google Scholar). The abundance of neuromodulin in the nerve terminal, together with its relative affinity for calmodulin, suggests that neuromodulin might be a major neuronal calmodulin-binding protein. While studies have demonstrated that neuromodulin in synaptic plasma membranes binds exogenous radiolabeled calmodulin, the functional significance of the neuromodulin/calmodulin interaction in the intact cell remains to be explored. We reported recently that forced expression of neuromodulin in mouse anterior pituitary AtT-20 cells enhanced K+-evoked hormone secretion and induced changes in cellular morphology (59Gamby C. Waage M.C. Allen R.G. Baizer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10023-10028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These results suggested that AtT-20 cells would be a useful experimental system to explore the molecular mechanism(s) of neuromodulin action. Here, we describe the results of studies designed to test the hypothesis that neuromodulin modulates K+-evoked secretion from AtT-20 cells by sequestering CaM at the plasma membrane and releasing it upon elevation of intracellular Ca2+. The cDNAs encoding [Asp41]rat neuromodulin (55Chapman E.R. Au D. Alexander K.A. Nicolson T.A. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 207-213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and [Gly3,Gly4] neuromodulin (60Chapman E.R. Estep R.P. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25233-25238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were the generous gift of Dr. Dan Storm (University of Washington, Seattle). The expression vectors for these mutant forms of rat neuromodulin were produced by ligating a 750-base pair HindIII/EcoRI restriction fragment containing the mutated rat neuromodulin coding sequence into the HindIII and EcoRI sites of the pRc/RSV vector (Invitrogen) with the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter (61Gorman C. Padmanabhan R. Howard B.H. Science. 1983; 221: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) driving expression of the cDNA. All cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. Monolayer cultures of D16 cells and transfected cell lines were maintained in 95% OptiMEM-I, 5% fetal bovine serum. The original AtT-20 cells were cultured in 85% OptiMEM-I, 10% equine serum, 5% fetal bovine serum; medium for routine culture of the transfected cells contained 200 μg/ml G418. All cell lines were incubated in humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37°C. The AtT-20/D16 cells were generously provided by Dr. Lee Limbird, Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University, and the original AtT-20 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CCL89). The original AtT-20 cells were transfected using the LipofectAMINE reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions as described previously (59Gamby C. Waage M.C. Allen R.G. Baizer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10023-10028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Permanent transfected cell lines were selected in medium containing 400 μg/ml G418. Clones were then isolated by limiting dilution and expanded in culture. Primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons, generously provided by Dr. Randy Hall and Andrès Barria-Roman, were prepared from rat pups 24-48 h post-natal. Hippocampi were dissected into room temperature osmotically balanced saline solution (SS: 137 mM NaCl, 5.3 mM KCl, 0.17 mM Na2HPO4, 0.22 mM KH2PO4, 10 mM Hepes, 33 mM glucose, 44 mM sucrose, 0.024 g/liter phenol red, pH 7.3, 325 mosm), cut into 5-6 pieces and incubated for 1 h with 10 ml of a 20 units/ml papain (Worthington) solution in SS. The papain solution was removed and the hippocampal fragments washed once in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1 μl/ml serum extender (Collaborative Research), 21 mM glucose, 10 μg/ml 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine, 25 μg/ml uridine (Sigma) (complete medium). Cells were then dissociated into fresh complete medium via 15-20 passes through a Pasteur pipette and plated into sterile, poly-L-lysine-coated 35-mm culture plates at an approximate density of 2 hippocampi/dish. Cultures were fed on post-culture days 1, 4, and 7 and used for experiments on culture day 8. Cultures prepared via this method are of extremely high density (roughly 1-2 million cells/35-mm plate) and have a very high neuron-to-glia ratio since they are cultured in the presence of a mitotic inhibitor (5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine) from the first day. Cells were washed free of medium twice with Krebs-Ringer-Hepes (KRH) buffer (125 mM NaCl, 4.8 mM KCl, 2.6 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 25 mM Hepes, 5.6 mM glucose, pH 7.4) and incubated at 20°C for the indicated time with the thiol-cleavable homobifunctional cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP, Pierce) at 1 mM diluted in KRH from a 25 mM stock solution in Me2SO (cross-linked cells) or solvent alone (non-cross-linked cells). At the end of the incubation period, cells were transferred on ice, washed three times with ice-cold KRH, scraped off the dish, and cell pellets were frozen at −70°C until the immunoblot analysis was performed. To study the effects of calcium on the association of neuromodulin and CaM, cells were incubated for 5 min in KRH alone or KRH containing 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO, vehicle for A23187) as controls, or KRH containing either 10 μM calcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma), or 56 mM KCl (in which the NaCl concentration was decreased to maintain iso-osmolarity) prior to treating the cells with DSP. To study the effects of PKC phosphorylation on the association of neuromodulin and CaM, cells were incubated for 5 min in KRH containing either 1 μM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA, Sigma) or 0.1% Me2SO (vehicle for TPA) as a control, prior to treating the cells with DSP. Total cellular protein and subcellular fractionation were performed as described (59Gamby C. Waage M.C. Allen R.G. Baizer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10023-10028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Five hundred μg of protein were immunoprecipitated with an anti-rat neuromodulin polyclonal antibody (9de La Monte S.M. Federoff H.J. Ng S.C. Grabczyk E. Fishman M.C. Dev. Brain Res. 1989; 46: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) for 1 h on ice. Immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose CL4B beads (Sigma) and washed once with 1 ml of 1 M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100; twice with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer, 1 M urea; and once with 1 ml of 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5. The material bound via the cross-linking agent to the neuromodulin immune complex was released by incubating the washed beads for 30 min at 37°C with elution buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 0.2 M dithiothreitol), followed by a brief centrifugation. The eluate containing the material released from the immune complex by the reducing agent was analyzed by immunoblot analysis with an anti-calmodulin antibody. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described (59Gamby C. Waage M.C. Allen R.G. Baizer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10023-10028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), using an anti-GAP-43 monoclonal antibody (clone GAP-7B10, Sigma,), or an anti-calmodulin monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), followed by a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma,). Bound antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (DuPont NEN) and exposure to x-ray film (X-Omat AR, Eastman Kodak Co.). Quantitation was done by scanning exposed films with the SigmaGel analysis software (Jandel Scientific Sofware). Secretion from the different cell lines was analyzed as described (59Gamby C. Waage M.C. Allen R.G. Baizer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10023-10028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Secreted and cellular hormones were measured by radioimmunoassay. Net secretion (corticotrophin-releasing factor or K+-stimulated minus basal) was expressed as the percent of total cellular stores of β-endorphin released during the incubation period. β-endorphin immunoassays were performed as described previously (62Hatfield J.M. Allen R.G. Stack J. Ronnekleiv O. Dev. Biol. 1988; 126: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), using an antiserum that is specific for β-endorphin residues 15-26. Synthetic acetyl-β-endorphin 1-27 was used as tracer and standard, and a 12-point standard curve was assayed with each group of samples. The unpaired t test was used to determine the statistical significance of the results. Cells were loaded with Fura-2/acetoxy-methyl ester (fura2/AM, Molecular Probes) as described (59Gamby C. Waage M.C. Allen R.G. Baizer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10023-10028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and fura-2 fluorescence was measured using a LS50 luminescence spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer). Ca2+ concentrations were calculated as described by Grynkiewicz et al. (63Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), using the Intracellular Biochemistry software package (Perkin-Elmer). While neuromodulin has been shown to interact with CaM in vitro (64Andreasen T.J. Keller C.H. LaPorte D.C. Edelman A.M. Storm D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2782-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 65Andreasen T.J. Luetje C.W. Heideman W. Storm D.R.

Chem. 1985; 260: 10784-10788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in purified synaptosomal plasma membranes (67De Graan P.N.E. Oestreicher A.B. De Wit M. Krá;f M. Schrama L.H. Gispen W.H. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 2139-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), this interaction has yet to be demonstrated in vivo. Because the affinity of CaM for neuromodulin has been reported to be relatively low (68Alexander K.A. Cimler B.M. Meier K.E. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6108-6113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we chose to use the approach of protein cross-linking to determine if CaM binds to neuromodulin in the intact cell. For these studies we used AtT-20/D16 (D16) cells, which express high levels of neuromodulin (59Gamby C. Waage M.C. Allen R.G. Baizer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10023-10028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the thiol-cleavable homobifunctional cross-linker DSP, which due to its lipophilic nature penetrates into the cytoplasm of living cells (69de Gunzburg J. Riehl R. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4007-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cultures of AtT-20/D16 cells were treated with 1 mM DSP for different times, and proteins were extracted and analyzed by Western blot with an anti-neuromodulin monoclonal antibody or with an anti-CaM monoclonal antibody. With both antibodies, a prominent 70-kDa band is detected and increases in intensity with increased time of cross-linking (Fig. 1A). Other neuromodulin immunoreactive bands are detected, with the 50-kDa band corresponding to that reported for native neuromodulin in a variety of studies (reviewed in 1Benowitz L.I. Routtenberg A. Trends Neurosci. 1987; 10: 527-532Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (458) Google Scholar); the higher molecular bands (>100 kDa) may correspond to neuromodulin complexed with actin, as these two proteins have also been shown to interact (70Strittmatter S.M. Vartanian T. Fishman M.C. J. Neurobiol. 1992; 23: 507-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Anti-CaM antibodies also detect a 20-kDa band corresponding to native CaM. The 70-kDa band is the result of cross-linking since it appears only after cross-linking (Fig. 1, B, lane 4; and C, lane 3) and is absent from membrane fractions from non cross-linked cells (Fig. 1, B, lane 2; and C, lane 1), or after reduction of cross-linked samples with β-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 1, B, lane 3; and C, lane 4). These results provide support for the notion that neuromodulin and CaM are associated in the intact AtT-20 cell. Quantitation by scanning densitometry indicates that as much as 70% of the CaM in the particulate fraction of AtT-20/D16 cells is present in this 70-kDa complex (Fig. 1C, lane 3). To analyze this association further, the original AtT-20 cells, which lack detectable expression of neuromodulin (59Gamby C. Waage M.C. Allen R.G. Baizer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10023-10028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the D16 cells were cross-linked as described previously, and neuromodulin and CaM were detected in particulate and soluble cellular fractions by immunoblot analysis with anti-neuromodulin or anti-CaM antibodies, respectively. Neuromodulin is detectable only in the particulate fraction of D16 cells (Fig. 2, lane 1) and is absent from the soluble fraction of the D16 cells and either fraction of the original AtT-20 cells (Fig. 2, lanes 2-4). Both cell lines have similar levels of CaM, which is mostly a soluble protein (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 8), but some CaM is also present in membrane fractions (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 7). In the particulate fraction from cross-linked D16 cells, which express neuromodulin, 70% of CaM is present in a 70-kDa complex (Fig. 2, lane 5). This complex is not detected in the absence of neuromodulin, either in the soluble fraction of D16 cells (Fig. 2, lane 6) or in the original AtT-20 cells (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 8), suggesting that the 70-kDa complex results from the association of neuromodulin and CaM. Finally, immunoprecipitation of solubilized membrane proteins from cross-linked D16 cells with a polyclonal anti-neuromodulin antibody, followed by immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal anti-CaM antibody of the material eluted from the immune complex, provides additional evidence that CaM is associated with neuromodulin in the intact AtT-20 cells (Fig. 3). Extensive in vitro analysis of the neuromodulin-CaM interaction has demonstrated that the affinity of neuromodulin for CaM is higher in the absence of Ca2+ than in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+ (68Alexander K.A. Cimler B.M. Meier K.E. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6108-6113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), leading to the suggestion that an elevation of intracellular calcium would promote dissociation of calmodulin from neuromodulin (58Apel E.D. Storm D.R. Perspectives Dev. Neurobiol. 1992; 1: 3-11PubMed Google Scholar, 68Alexander K.A. Cimler B.M. Meier K.E. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6108-6113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if this is in fact occurring in the intact cell, we performed cross-linking and immunoblot experiments with D16 cells cultured in conditions that induce elevation of intracellular Ca2+. D16 cells were treated with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (10 μM) for 5 min at 20°C or with 0.1% Me2SO (control) and then cross-linked with 1 mM DSP for 5 min at 20°C, and membrane proteins were analyzed by immunoblot analysis with anti-neuromodulin and anti-CaM antibodies (Fig. 4A). In the absence of the Ca2+ ionophore, a prominent 70-kDa band corresponding to the neuromodulin-CaM complex was detectable with both antibodies (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 4). Treatment of the cells with the Ca2+ ionophore caused a marked reduction in the intensity of this 70-kDa band (approximately 90% reduction, as measured by scanning densitometry; Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 3). Membrane depolarization is an alternative method for inducing an elevation of intracellular Ca2+ in AtT-20 cells (59Gamby C. Waage M.C. Allen R.G. Baizer L. J. Biol.

Cultures of D16 cells were therefore also incubated for 5 min in KRH solution containing 56 mM KCl, prior to cross-linking with DSP, followed by analysis of membrane extracts by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4B). The transient elevation of intracellular Ca2+ produced by depolarization also caused a significant reduction of the complex"

The GTP-binding protein(s) responsible for the translocation has remained to be identified. Using a sensitive and quantitative method to assess the translocation of c-MYC epitope-tagged GLUT4, we obtained evidence that the activation of receptor-coupled Gq (neither Gi nor Gs) triggered GLUT4 translocation in cells, independently of insulin signaling pathway(s). Platelet-activating factor (PAF) induced GLUT4 translocation in the cells expressing the Gi- and Gq-coupled PAF receptor, but the translocation was induced even after pretreatment with wortmannin, an islet-activating protein and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. Norepinephrine triggered GLUT4 translocation in cells expressing the Gq-coupled α1-adrenergic receptor, but prostaglandin E2 did not cause GLUT4 translocation in cells expressing the Gs-coupled EP4 receptor or the Gi-coupled EP3α receptor. The norepinephrine-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake via Gq may possibly contribute to the fuel supply required for thermogenesis in brown adipocytes and for the enhanced contractility in cardiomyocytes, both of which have an abundant endogenous GLUT4.

To examine molecular mechanisms of GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, we developed a highly sensitive and quantitative method to measure directly c-MYC epitope-tagged GLUT4 (GLUT4myc) on the cell surface (6Kanai F. Nishioka Y. Hayashi H. Kamohara S. Todaka M. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14523-14526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using this system, we have found that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase, p85/p110 heterodimer type) is involved in signal transductions of GLUT4 translocation not only by insulin but also by platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor (7Kanai F.

Other investigators reported that PI 3-kinase plays a pivotal role in the insulin-stimulated GLUT1 and GLUT4 translocations in CHO cells and adipocytes, respectively (10Endemann G. Yonezawa K.

Therefore, the CHO cell system as well as 3T3-L1 adipocytes are useful for studying molecular mechanisms of GLUT4 translocation (see “Discussion”). On the other hand, GLUT4 translocation is also induced in permeabilized adipocytes by treatment with guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS) of nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs, as well as by insulin (13Baldini G. Hohman R. Charron M.J. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4037-4040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The GTPγS-induced GLUT4 translocation was also observed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and CHO cells stably expressing the GLUT4myc, using this method of detection (6Kanai F. Nishioka Y. Hayashi H. Kamohara S. Todaka M. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14523-14526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the GTP-binding protein(s) responsible for the GLUT4 translocation has remained to be identified. Some small GTP-binding proteins play important roles in intracellular vesicle trafficking or secretion (15Paterson H.F. Self A.J. Garrett M.D. Just I. Akotories K. Hall A. J.

Nutr. 1995; 15: 441-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, we reported that the small GTP-binding proteins, Ras, Rab3D, Rad, and Rho are unlikely to be involved in the GLUT4 translocations with insulin, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and GTPγS treatments, and that the signaling pathway of the GTPγS-stimulated GLUT4 translocation is different from those of insulin and PMA treatments (22Todaka M.

In addition, NaF plus AlCl3 treatment, which is known to activate heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins, stimulates GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake in adipocytes and in CHO cells (6Kanai F.

This suggests that heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein(s) may be involved in the GTPγS-stimulated GLUT4 translocation.

The GLUT4 translocation and the enhanced glucose uptake are mediated insulin-independently via adrenergic receptors coupled to heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins. However, the molecular mechanism of insulin-independent GLUT4 translocation was not elucidated. We report here that Gq-coupled receptors, but not Gi- nor Gs-coupled receptors, trigger GLUT4 translocation in an insulin-independent manner in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and CHO cells. The parent cell lines used in this study were CHO-GLUT4myc, a CHO cell line expressing GLUT4myc, constructed by inserting a human c-MYC epitope (14 amino acids) into the first ectodomain of GLUT4, and 3T3-L1-GLUT4myc, a 3T3-L1 fibroblast line expressing GLUT4myc. The 3T3-L1-GLUT4myc fibroblasts were induced to differentiate into adipocytes as described previously (6Kanai F. Nishioka Y. Hayashi H. Kamohara S. Todaka M. Ebina Y. J. Biol.

These plasmids were cotransfected into CHO cells, CHO-GLUT4myc cells, and 3T3-L1-GLUT4myc cells with pSV2-bsr, a blasticidin S deaminase expression plasmid, and selected with blasticidin S hydrochloride (Funakoshi). Several independent clones expressing each receptor were established and designated as follows, CHO-GLUT4myc-PAFR, CHO-GLUT4myc-EP3α, CHO-GLUT4myc-EP4, and CHO-GLUT4myc-α1bAR cells were CHO-GLUT4myc cells stably expressing the PAFR, PGE2 receptors EP3α, EP4, and α1b-AR, respectively.

The CHO-GLUT4myc cells expressing various receptors in 24-well plates were incubated in 500 μl of KRH buffer (6Kanai F. Nishioka Y. Hayashi H. Kamohara S. Todaka M. Ebina Y. J. Biol.

The 3T3-L1-GLUT4myc-PAFR and 3T3-L1-GLUT4myc-α1aAR adipocytes in 24-well plates were incubated in 500 μl of KRH buffer for 20 min at 37°C and then treated with indicated concentrations of ligands for indicated periods at 37°C. GLUT4myc translocation was measured after fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde, as described previously (6Kanai F. Nishioka Y. Hayashi H. Kamohara S. Todaka M. Ebina Y. J. Biol.

Cells were pretreated with or without PDBu (100 ng/ml) for 24 h at 37°C in medium for down-regulating protein kinase C and with or without IAP (100 ng/ml) for 24 h at 37°C in medium that abolishes Gi-coupled pathway(s). To inactivate PI 3-kinases, the cells were pretreated with or without indicated concentrations of wortmannin for 20 min at 37°C. The cAMP levels were measured using Yamasa radioimmunoassay kits as described (36Nakamura M. Honda Z. Waga I. Matsumoto T. Noma M. Shimizu T.

GTPγS or NaF plus AlCl3 treatments triggered the GLUT4myc translocation in both 3T3-L1-GLUT4myc adipocytes and CHO-GLUT4myc cells, as did the endogenous GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1-adipocytes (6Kanai F.

To examine which heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein(s) is responsible for the GTPγS-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, we used both 3T3-L1-GLUT4myc adipocytes and CHO-GLUT4myc cells. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor (PAFR) is thought to transmit the signal via IAP-sensitive (Gi) and -insensitive (Gq) heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (28Nakamura M. Honda Z. Izumi T.

As shown in Fig. 1, 3T3-L1-GLUT4myc adipocytes stably expressing PAF receptors showed that PAF-stimulated GLUT4myc translocation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, whereas the parent 3T3-L1-GLUT4myc adipocytes did not respond to any concentrations of PAF (Fig. 1, A and B). PAF treatment also increased the rate of glucose uptake in 3T3-L1-GLUT4myc-PAFR adipocytes, in proportion to GLUT4myc translocation (Fig. 1, A and C). Almost the same dose- and time-dependent GLUT4myc translocation and glucose uptake in response to PAF were observed in CHO-GLUT4myc-PAFR cells but not in the parent CHO-GLUT4myc cells (Fig. 1, D--F). The CHO-GLUT4myc cells have relatively large amounts of endogenous GLUT1 compared with GLUT4myc, and the GLUT1 might affect the rate of glucose uptake. The translocated-GLUT4myc in response to PAF increased the rate of glucose uptake in CHO-PAFR-GLUT4myc cells, compared with CHO-PAFR cells (Table I). The enhanced glucose uptake in CHO-PAFR cells was attributed to GLUT1 translocation, because PAF stimulated GLUT1myc translocation in CHO-PAFR-GLUT1myc cells. 2K. Kishi, H. Hayashi, and Y.

Open table in a new tab Next, we examined the effect of wortmannin on the PAF-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1-GLUT4myc-PAFR adipocytes and CHO-GLUT4myc-PAFR cells; wortmannin completely inhibited the insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and CHO-GLUT4myc cells, by abolishing phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity (7Kanai F.

As shown in Figs. 2A and 3A, wortmannin inhibited the insulin-stimulated GLUT4myc translocation dose dependently and abolished the translocation at 10−7M in both lines of cells. This inhibitory effect on the insulin-stimulated translocation was closely related to that on PI 3-kinase (p85/p110 heterodimer type) activity. 3K. Tamaoka, L. Wang, K. Kishi, H. Hayashi, and Y. Ebina, unpublished data. However, the PAF-induced GLUT4myc translocations were 3.8-fold in 3T3-L1-GLUT4myc-PAFR adipocytes and 9.4-fold in CHO-GLUT4myc-PAFR cells, even in the presence of 10−6M wortmannin. Therefore, the PAF-stimulated GLUT4myc translocation pathway was independent of PI 3-kinases including p110γ (40Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S.

The cells were stimulated with 2 × 10−8M PAF (solid bar), 10−7M insulin (shaded bar), 10−6M PMA (hatched bar), or buffer alone (open bar) for 10 min at 37°C. The GLUT4myc translocations are shown.

Takano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Ito K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2307-2315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PAF-stimulated GLUT4myc translocation of 3T3-L1-GLUT4myc-PAFR adipocytes was partially inhibited but remained to a certain extent (from 4.4-fold increase to 2.4-fold increase) (Fig. 2B) (see “Discussion”). On the other hand, the PAF-stimulated GLUT4myc translocation of CHO-GLUT4myc-PAFR cells was not affected significantly by treatment of 100 ng/ml IAP (Fig. 3B), a treatment that abolished the Gi coupling (39Honda Z. Takano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Ito K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2307-2315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The IAP-insensitive pathway observed in the both cell lines is thought to be mediated by Gq, which activates phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C β (PLCβ) to hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) (41Smrcka A.V. Hepler J.R. Brown K.O. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1991; 251: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 42Taylor S.J. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Exton J.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 516-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The breakdown products, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol, activate a Ca2+ channel and protein kinase C, respectively (43Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1984; 312: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (4254) Google Scholar, 44Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5764) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether the IAP-insensitive GLUT4myc translocation by PAF is due to protein kinase C activation or to [Ca2+]i increase. PMA induces GLUT4 translocation by activating protein kinase C in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and CHO-GLUT4myc cells (6Kanai F. Nishioka Y. Hayashi H. Kamohara S. Todaka M. Ebina Y. J. Biol.

The PMA-stimulated GLUT4myc translocations in 3T3-L1-GLUT4myc-PAFR adipocytes (1.3-fold increase) and CHO-GLUT4myc-PAFR cells (4.2-fold increase) were abolished by PDBu pretreatment that down-regulates protein kinase C, albeit the extent of translocation differing between the two lines (Figs. 2C and 3C). However, the same PDBu pretreatment had no apparent effects on the PAF-stimulated GLUT4myc translocation, in the both lines. In addition, PAF triggered GLUT4myc translocation (1.9-3.3-fold) and the resultant glucose uptake (2.3-fold) in both lines, even after simultaneous IAP, PDBu, and wortmannin treatment (Figs. 2, D and E, and 3D). To examine the effects of [Ca2+]i on the PAF-stimulated GLUT4myc translocation, we used two different Ca2+ ionophores. Ionomycin (1 μM) and PAF (2 × 10−8M) treatments elevated [Ca2+]i in CHO-GLUT4myc-PAFR cells, from basal levels (lower than 100 nM) up to about 900 and 600 nM, respectively, as in Fig. 4E. However, neither ionomycin (1 μM) nor A23187 (1 μM) led to GLUT4myc translocation in 3T3-L1-GLUT4myc-PAFR adipocytes and CHO-GLUT4myc-PAFR cells, whereas PAF evoked GLUT4myc translocation (Fig. 4, A and C). Depletion of [Ca2+]i by 1,2-bis-(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N, N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM) (Fig. 4E), inhibited the PAF-stimulated GLUT4myc translocation, in both lines (Fig. 4, B and D). Thus, a certain level of [Ca2+]i was required for PAF-stimulated GLUT4myc translocation (see “Discussion”), but the elevation of [Ca2+]i was insufficient to cause GLUT4myc translocation. Abundant receptors specifically coupled to Gq, Gi, and Gs have been identified (47Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). To confirm that GLUT4 translocation is triggered by Gq activation, we used the well-characterized α1b (α1B)-adrenergic receptor, prostaglandin E2, receptors EP3α, and EP4 as Gq-, Gi-, and Gs-coupled receptors, respectively (29Sugimoto Y.

Pharmacol. 1994; 268: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Prostaglandin E2 did not translocate GLUT4myc in CHO-GLUT4myc cells expressing the prostaglandin E2 receptor EP4 (CHO-GLUT4myc-EP4) (Fig. 5A), although it did stimulate cAMP formation in the same cells by activating Gs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). Prostaglandin E2 inhibited the forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation dose-dependently by coupling Gi in CHO-GLUT4myc cells expressing the prostaglandin E2 receptor EP3α (CHO-GLUT4myc-EP3α) (Fig. 5D), but prostaglandin E2 did not cause GLUT4myc translocation in the same cells (Fig. 5C). In contrast, norepinephrine stimulated GLUT4myc translocation by 4.3-4.4-fold in CHO-GLUT4myc cells stably expressing α1b-adrenergic receptors (CHO-GLUT4myc-α1bAR) (Fig. 5E) and raised [Ca2+]i (Fig. 5F) presumably by coupling Gq. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, norepinephrine stimulated GLUT4myc translocation in a dose- and time-dependent manner in CHO-GLUT4myc-α1bAR cells but not in the parent CHO-GLUT4myc cells. Norepinephrine stimulated glucose uptake in CHO-GLUT4myc-α1bAR in almost the same dose-dependent manner as GLUT4myc translocation (Fig. 6C). The fold increase of glucose uptake, however, is not in proportion to that of GLUT4myc translocation, because the norepinephrine-stimulated glucose uptake resulted from the translocations of both the endogenous GLUT1 and exogenous GLUT4myc in CHO cells. The GLUT4myc translocated to the cell surface in response to norepinephrine took up more glucose in CHO-α1bAR-GLUT4myc cells, compared with CHO-α1bAR cells (Table II). The enhanced glucose uptake in the CHO-α1bAR cells was probably due to GLUT1 translocation, because norepinephrine stimulated GLUT1myc translocation in CHO-GLUT1myc-α1bAR cells. 4L. Wang, H.

https://openalex.org/W2041564566,"To ascertain the anionic sites on the nicotinic receptor to which acetylcholine and other quaternary ammonium ligands bind, we have examined the role of an aspartyl residue (Asp-152) in the α-subunit. Prior photolytic labeling with agonist analogues of the neighboring residues Trp-149 and Tyr-151 suggests that their side chains reside on the binding face (also termed the (+)- or counterclockwise face) of the α-subunit. Asp-152 presents an anionic charge in the vicinity of these aromatic residues. Modification of the aspartate to asparagine (D152N) creates a glycosylation signal (Asn-152-Gly-Ser), and we find, on the basis of altered electrophoretic migration, that glycosylation occurs at this position upon cotransfection of the mutant α-subunit with β-, γ-, and δ-subunits. Glycosylation results in a reduction in the capacity of the receptor to assemble; this reduction is manifest in the initial step of dimer formation between the αγ- and αδ-subunits. The α-subunit mutant receptor reaching the assembled pentamer exhibits an altered selectivity for certain ligands. Little reduction in α-bungarotoxin binding is observed, whereas affinities for agonists and competitive alkaloid antagonists are reduced substantially. Separation of the contributions of charge removal and glycosylation addition shows that both factors affect agonist affinity, with the charge influence being far more predominant. These findings raise the possibility that a component of the coulombic attraction stabilizing the binding of agonists comes from the aspartyl residue at position 152 in the α-subunit.

The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in muscle is a pentamer of four homologous subunits with a stoichiometry of α2βγδ (15Galzi J.L. Changeux J.-P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 554-565Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar and Changeux, 1994; 23Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar and Akabas, 1995). The subunits appear to contain an amino-terminal extracellular domain of ∼210 amino acids, followed by four transmembrane-spanning regions. The majority of the cytoplasmic domain of each subunit is found between transmembrane spans 3 and 4. Since the sequences between transmembrane spans 2 and 3 and between span 4 and the carboxyl terminus are of limited length, virtually all of the extracellular domain is contained in the amino-terminal 210 residues. Indeed, the residues constituting the binding sites for agonists and competitive antagonists appear in this region (cf. Galzi and Changeux (1994), 40Sine S.M. Kreienkamp H.-J. Bren N. Maeda R.K. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar et al. (1995a), and Karlin and Akabas (1995)), as do the residues that govern subunit assembly (18Gu Y. Camacho P. Gardner P. Hall Z.W. Neuron. 1991; 6: 879-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar et al., 1991; 26Kreienkamp H.-J. Maeda R.K. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 636-644Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (92) Google Scholar et al., 1995). Two binding sites for agonists are found on each pentamer and reside at the αγ- and αδ-interfaces (4Blount P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1989; 3: 349-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar and Merlie, 1989; 34Petersen S.E. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar and Cohen, 1990). Through affinity labeling and site-specific mutagenesis, three distinct domains in the α-subunit appear to be involved in ligand binding: the regions in the vicinity of Tyr-93 and Trp-149 and the region between residues 180 and 200 (cf. Galzi and Changeux (1994) and Karlin and Akabas (1995)). Since the same face of the α-subunit is involved in the binding interaction for those ligands that differ in affinity at the αγ- and αδ-interfaces, the distinctions must come from residues located on the γ- and δ-subunits. While isolated α-subunits will bind the elapid α-toxins with moderately high affinities, addition of γ- or δ-subunits results in a binding site in which the α-toxin affinity is increased substantially and carbamylcholine or other agonists become competitive with α-toxin binding (Blount and Merlie, 1989; 37Sine S.M. Claudio T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19369-19377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Claudio, 1991). Several non-α-subunit residues (Lys-34, Trp-55, Ser-111, Tyr-117, Phe-172, and Asp-174 in γ and the corresponding positions in δ) contribute to ligand specificity. Their involvement has been ascertained through site-directed labeling (7Chiara D.C. Cohen J.B. Biophys. J. 1992; 61 (abstr.): A106Google Scholar and Cohen, 1992), site-specific mutagenesis (36Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3160-3164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar and Karlin, 1995). Of these residues, only Asp-174 in the γ-subunit or Asp-180 in the δ-subunit is negatively charged, and chemical cross-linking between Cys-192 or Cys-193 in the α-subunit and Asp-180 in the δ-subunit raised the possibility that an anionic subsite is found on the neighboring subunit (Czajkowski and Karlin, 1995). More recently, mutagenesis studies have shown a marked reduction in agonist affinity upon neutralization of γ-Asp-174 or δ-Asp-180 (28Martin M. Czajkowski C. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13497-13503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar et al., 1996). As such, a bound ligand such as acetylcholine would span between the subunits. However, lophotoxin, a rigid cyclic analogue of acetylcholine, has been shown to label Tyr-190 in the α-subunit (1Abramson S.N. Li Y. Culver P. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12666-12672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar et al., 1989). The reactive moiety in lophotoxin is an electrophile with a partial positive charge (Abramson et al., 1991). Since the reactive electrophile might be expected to occupy the same site on the receptor as the quaternary group in acetylcholine, an anionic side chain in the α-subunit may also contribute to quaternary ligand stabilization. To examine this possibility, we have mutated candidate anionic residues in the α-subunit. Since prior studies have shown that regions on the α-subunit binding face around residues 93 and 149 and between residues 180 and 200 contribute to ligand binding, aspartates and glutamates in this vicinity were initially investigated. α-125I-Bungarotoxin (specific activity of 8-16 μCi/μg) was a product of DuPont NEN. Dimethyl-d-tubocurarine was obtained from Lilly. Other biochemical reagents were obtained from Sigma. The monoclonal antibody 210, directed against the α-subunit, was a generous gift of Dr. Jon Lindstrom (University of Pennsylvania). Double-stranded plasmids containing the cDNA sequences of the four receptor subunits used for mutagenesis and expression were prepared as described by 25Kreienkamp H.-J. Sine S.M. Maeda R.K. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8108-8114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar et al. (1994). To prepare single-stranded plasmids for mutagenesis, plasmids containing a cDNA encoding the mouse muscle α-subunit were transfected into competent CJ236 bacteria and selected in ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Helper phage stock was added; further selection was accomplished with kanamycin; and single-stranded plasmids were isolated following polyethylene glycol precipitation and extraction with chloroform/phenol. Mutagenesis was performed using the above single-stranded templates (27Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar et al., 1987). Following a synthesis reaction, double-stranded plasmids were isolated from DH5α bacterial cells by CsCl density centrifugation. DNA sequence changes were detected by restriction mapping and verified by dideoxy-DNA sequencing. cDNAs encoding wild-type α-, β-, γ-, and δ-subunits and mutant α-subunits were placed in an expression plasmid containing a cytomegalovirus promoter. The cDNAs were transfected using Ca3(PO4)2 into human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells at a stoichiometric ratio of α2 (15 μg)/β (7.5 μg)/γ (7.5 μg)/δ (7.5 μg), α2/β/γ2, or α2/β/δ2 (Kreienkamp et al., 1995; 41Sine S.M.

Receptor expression was typically measured 48 h after transfection. For receptor binding assays, cells were harvested by treating plates with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mM EDTA. The cells were gently sedimented by centrifugation and resuspended in Ringer K+ buffer, and the specified concentrations of ligands were added. For electrophoresis and Western blotting, after the culture medium was removed, the plates were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline/EDTA, sedimented, and resuspended in an appropriate buffer. To ascertain whether additional glycosylation occurred in the αD152N mutant receptor, we examined the migration positions of the α-subunit by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS. Washed and resuspended cells in amounts to give 200 fmol of α-125I-bungarotoxin sites (typically from a confluent 10-cm plate) were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer and separated on 8-cm 10% polyacrylamide gels as described previously (24Keller S.H. Kreienkamp H.-J. Kawanishi C. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4165-4171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar et al., 1995). The migration positions of the α-subunits were detected by Western blot analysis using mAb 210 directed against the α-subunit. Assembly of receptor subunits was analyzed by transfection of the cDNAs at the described stoichiometric ratios. After 48 h, cells were harvested and incubated with 20 nMα-125I-bungarotoxin for 2 h. The cells were subsequently sedimented and washed three times in Ringer K+ buffer. Bound α-125I-bungarotoxin was quantitated by γ-counting. Association and dissociation rates for α-bungarotoxin were measured as described by Kreienkamp et al. (1994). For association measurements, α-125I-bungarotoxin (20 nM) was added to cells, and the reaction was stopped at appropriate times by placing an aliquot of cells into an excess of carbamylcholine. Unbound α-toxin was washed away, and the cells were sedimented. Nonspecific α-toxin binding was measured by prior incubation of the cells in 10 mM carbamylcholine and determination of bound α-toxin at various times. For dissociation rate measurements, cells were incubated in 40 nMα-125I-bungarotoxin for at least 2 h. The cells were diluted into a large volume of Ringer K+ buffer; α-toxin was allowed to dissociate; and cells were washed free of α-toxin at specified times. Dissociation constants were calculated by assuming bimolecular association and unimolecular dissociation processes. Dissociation constants for the various ligands were measured by competition with the initial rate of α-125I-bungarotoxin binding after prior equilibration with the ligand (38Sine S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3315-3325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Taylor, 1979; Kreienkamp et al., 1994). Cells were harvested by permeabilization with a saponin-containing buffer (10 mM NaPO4 (pH 7.0), 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and a 0.5% saponin) and incubated with 10 nMα-125I-bungarotoxin for 2 h on ice. Cells were washed free of unbound radioactivity with Ringer K+ buffer. The cell pellets were solubilized on ice in 200 μl of Triton X-100-containing buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)). After 3-4 h, insoluble matter was sedimented, and the supernatants were layered on 12-ml 3-30% sucrose gradients in the same buffer and detergent. Gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW 41 rotor for 22 h at 40,000 rpm at 4°C. The gradients were collected from the top in fractions of 240 or 266 μl and counted in a γ-counter. S values were determined by adding carbonic anhydrase (3.3 S), alkaline phosphatase (6.1 S), catalase (11 S), and β-galactosidase (16 S) to the cell extracts and determining their activities in the gradient fractions. Table I shows residues presumed to be in the vicinity of amino acids as identified by prior labeling experiments. α-Asp-89, Asp-97, and Asp-99 in Domain I are possible candidate anionic residues that may lie in the vicinity of the ligand-binding interface. Asp-89 and Asp-97 are conserved throughout all subunits and may be responsible for proper folding of the subunits.

However, upon insertion of the D99R mutation into the α1-subunit template, we did not obtain detectable expression upon cotransfection of this mutant α-subunit with β-, γ-, and δ-subunits.Table IAligned amino acid sequences of three main binding domains identified in the α-subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors from mammalian muscle and the central nervous systemThe residues detected by the affinity labeling are underlined.

Its absence in α7 might suggest that another anionic residue subserves this role in α7-containing pentamers. In Domain III, α-Glu-180 and Asp-200 are possible candidates, but other functional and structural considerations would argue that they are less likely to reside on a binding interface. First, mutation of Asp-200 led to little change in ligand binding or in agonist-elicited responses (O'Leary et al., 1994). Second, α-Glu-180 lies sufficiently far in sequence from Tyr-190 that it may reside closer to a nonbinding face of the subunit. Since mutation at position 152 results in insertion of a consensus glycosylation signal (Asn-X-Ser), ascertaining whether glycosylation occurs should allow discrimination between the influences of addition of an oligosaccharide and charge neutralization on receptor assembly and ligand binding behavior. Following expression of the α-subunit with β-, γ-, and δ-subunits, extraction of the cells and electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels in the presence of SDS reveal that insertion of a glycosylation signal at position 152 (Asn-152-Gly-Ser) results in retardation of the migrating α-subunit when compared with the wild-type α-subunit. An additional mutation (S154A), which eliminates the essential hydroxylated side chain requirement in the glycosylation signal, results in the migration rate of the α-subunit returning to a value similar to that in the wild-type α-subunit (Fig. 1). Thus, residue 152, when mutated from Asp to Asn, becomes glycosylated. Similar reductions in migration of the α-subunit were observed previously when glycosylation signals were inserted at positions 187 and 189 in the α-subunit and could be reversed by substitution for the serine or threonine two residues carboxyl-terminal to the Asn (Keller et al., 1995). Fig. 2 shows that the mutation D152N reduces expression of the receptor on the cell surface when cDNAs encoding the various subunit combinations known to reach the cell surface are transfected into HEK cells. Expression of a receptor as α2βγδ, using four subunits in the transfection mixture, yields the greatest expression compared with α2βγ2 and α2βδ2 (Sine and Claudio, 1991; 17Green W.N. Claudio T. Cell. 1993; 74: 57-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar and Claudio, 1993). Glycosylation of the α-subunit shows a reduction in subunit assembly and export of receptor to the cell surface. The greatest reduction in assembly for the three combinations of assembled pentamer was found for the α2βγ2 combination (Fig. 2B). Elimination of the glycosylation signal by a serine to alanine mutation at position 154 substantially increases cell-surface expression, but not quite to the level seen with the wild-type receptor. To examine whether the reduction in cell-surface expression occurs in an initial assembly step of subunits or in the translocation of the assembled pentamer to the cell surface, we examined intracellular assembly of dimeric forms of the receptor in permeabilized cells. As seen in Fig. 3, the D152N mutation reduces the formation of αδ-dimers, αγ-dimers, and αγαγ-tetramers. The reduction in intermediate dimer formation was also observed when the β-subunit was transfected with the pairs of α- and γ-subunits or α- and δ-subunits (data not shown). Although the major peak, by far, is the monomeric species with the D152N mutation, a definite skewing of the peak shapes is evident in the gradients, suggesting association of the α-subunit to form small quantities of oligomeric receptor species. Presumably sufficient assembly of dimers is occurring to allow sequential assembly and formation of pentameric receptor, but in greatly reduced quantities (Fig. 2). To ascertain whether glycosylation is limiting for dimer formation, we also monitored subunit assembly for the double mutant αD152N,S154A. Serine is found at this position in only a few of the receptor subunits and not in all α-subunits (Table I). The sedimentation profiles show discrete peaks for the dimeric (αγ and αδ) and tetrameric (αγαγ) species (Fig. 3). This profile of enhanced assembly is consistent with an increased level of expression on the cell surface for the receptor containing the double mutant compared with the single mutant in the α-subunit. Hence, the enhanced capacity to form dimers intracellularly in the initial step increases the abundance of partially assembled precursors for formation of pentameric receptors on the cell surface. Sufficient receptor containing the mutation αD152N does appear on the cell surface to enable an analysis of ligand specificity. Analysis of association and dissociation rates for α-125I-bungarotoxin shows the respective rate constants to be virtually unchanged (Fig. 4 and Table II). Similar behavior is seen for the D152N,S154A mutation, with little change in association kinetics (Fig. 4 and Table II). Thus, neither insertion of an oligosaccharide residue nor charge neutralization at position 152 results in an alteration in α-toxin binding kinetics.Table II.The influence of mutations affecting the charge and oligosaccharide conjugation at Asp-152 in the α-subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptorLigandKD(μM) (Hill slope = nH)αWild-typeαD152NαD152N, S154AαD152QAgonistCarbamylcholine14.5 (nH = 1.22)1800 (nH = 1.22)401 (nH = 1.23)446 (nH = 1.44)Suberyldicholine0.36 (nH = 1.26)26.2 (nH = 1.05)11.8 (nH = 1.57)4.40 (nH = 1.38)Partial agonistDecamethonium10.5 (nH = 0.70)227 (nH = 0.92)209 (nH = 0.75)NDaND, not determined.Antagonistd-Tubocurarine0.15, 6.77.6, 2463.0, 37.8ND aND, not determined.Dimethyl-d-tubocurarine0.17, 11.96.8, 8013.4, 39527.6, 1180α-BungarotoxinKD (pM)64156147ND aND, not determined.k1 (M−1 min−1)4.6 × 1063.0 × 1062.3 × 106k−1 (min−1)3.0 × 10−44.6 × 10−43.3 × 10−4a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Examination of the interaction of the competitive antagonists d-tubocurarine and dimethyl-d-tubocurarine reveals a marked reduction in ligand affinity with the D152N mutation. Elimination of the glycosylation signal through formation of the D152N,S154A double mutant only slightly reverses the loss of affinity (Fig. 5, B and C). Thus, both glycosylation and charge neutralization lead to reductions in antagonist affinity, with the far greater effect arising from charge neutralization. Decamethonium, a partial agonist but also a bis-quaternary ligand, shows similar reductions in affinity with charge neutralization (Fig. 5A). The agonist carbamylcholine, with only a single quaternary group, shows reductions in affinity of similar magnitude to the curarine antagonists and the bismethonium partial agonist (Fig. 6A). A virtually identical pattern is seen with the bis-quaternary agonist suberyldicholine (Fig. 6B). Here again, oligosaccharide addition and charge neutralization diminish the binding energy, with the predominant influence imparted by charge neutralization.Fig. 6Occupation of agonists with mutant and wild-type receptors after transfection of HEK cells with cDNAs encoding wild-type and mutant α-subunits along with β-, γ-, and δ-subunit cDNAs.

With this mutation, the glycosylation signal is lacking, and this mutation should not lead to additional glycosylation (6Buller A.L. Hastings G.A. Kirkness E.F. Fraser C.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 858-865PubMed Google Scholar et al., 1994). The dissociation constants of the agonists and antagonists for D152Q closely resemble those found for the αD152N,S154A mutant (Table II). The elimination of charge on an aspartyl residue at position 152 in the α-subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alters both the capacity for assembly with other subunits and the ligand specificity of the assembled receptor. We selected this residue based on a survey of charged residues in the regions of the α-subunit known to affect ligand binding and therefore presumed to be located at the binding site. This face of the α-subunit should be in apposition with an opposing face of the γ- or δ-subunit. Obviously, with only fragmentary data on the overall structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, we cannot exclude the involvement of other anionic residues in the α-subunit contributing to receptor assembly or ligand specificity. Initial studies examining residues affecting binding site affinity utilized site-directed reagents reactive with vicinal cysteines 192 and 193 (21Kao P.N. Dwork A.J. Kaldany R.-R.J. Silver M.L.

Other residues were identified by ligand conjugation to residues on the protein using photolytic procedures for p-(N,N)-dimethylaminobenzene diazonium fluoroborate and nicotine or a chemically reactive ligand, acetylcholine mustard (12Dennis M.

These studies revealed three regions of reactivity proximal to the residues: Tyr-93, Trp-149, and, through labeling of Tyr-190 and Tyr-198, the region encompassing Cys-192 and Cys-193. The lophotoxins, naturally occurring and chemically reactive toxins from coral, also inhibit receptor function by conjugating with Tyr-190 (Abramson et al., 1989). Extension of these initial findings by site-specific mutagenesis confirmed the involvement of these residues in ligand binding (30Mishina M. Tobimatsu T. Imoto K. Tanaka K. Fujita Y. Fukuda K.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8808-8816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar et al., 1994; Corringer et al., 1995). Moreover, mutations that generate glycosylation signals at amino acid positions found in α-neurotoxin-resistant animal species appear to sterically inhibit α-toxin binding (Kreienkamp et al., 1994; Keller et al., 1995). These residues, which exist as asparagines in the resistant species, are found at positions 187 and 189 and are presumably exposed at the cell surface. The D152N mutation retards electrophoretic mobility of the α-subunit to a similar extent as mutations known to place a glycosylation signal at positions 187 and 189 (Keller et al., 1995). Glycosylation at position 152, which appears complete in the gene product of transfection (Fig. 1), suggests that this asparagine is a surface residue. Inhibition of αD152N receptor expression appears to be a consequence of the initial association of α- and γ-subunits and of α- and δ-subunits. Inhibition at this step is completely consistent with the location of Asp-152 on the (+)- or counterclockwise face of the α-subunit, in apposition with residues on the (−)- or clockwise face of the γ- and δ-subunits. The finding that residual assembly still occurs to form a pentameric receptor indicates that the oligosaccharide linked to Asn-152 does not occlude the contact residues from forming the interface between subunits. Ile-145 and Thr-150 on the γ-subunit also appear on the counterclockwise face since their mutations to lysines found in the δ-subunit preclude formation of αγαγ-tetramers from αγ-dimers, but not the initial formation of the αγ-dimers (Kreienkamp et al., 1995). Modification of α-Asp-152 to Asn with its isosteric neutral side chain reveals the combined influence of charge neutralization and oligosaccharide addition on receptor assembly and binding parameters. Substitution of Ser-154, the other required component in the N-linked glycosylation signal, enabled us to dissect the individual contributions, and this has yielded some unanticipated findings. First, the lack of influence of glycosylation on α-toxin binding kinetics contrasts with the results of other asparagine-linked glycosylation additions, which also reside in the vicinity of the ligand-binding site. The α-subunits of nicotinic receptors from the snake (Naja) and the mongoose have glycosylation signals at residues 187 and 189, respectively (31Neumann J. Barchan D. Horowitz M. Kochva E. Fuchs S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7255-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar et al., 1989; 3Barchan D. Kachalsky S. Neumann D. Vogel A. Ovadia N. Kochva E. Fuchs S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7717-7721Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar et al., 1992). Insertion of glycosylation signals at these positions in the mouse α-subunit template leads to additional glycosylation and results in a reduction in α-toxin affinity (Keller et al., 1995). Since the oligosaccharides at positions 187 and 189 primarily affect the binding of the large α-toxins and not the smaller peptide or alkaloid antagonists, their influence on ligand binding is presumed to arise from imposition of steric constraints in the binding site (Kreienkamp et al., 1994). By contrast, oligosaccharide conjugation at position 152 interferes only with binding of the smaller ligands. Hence, the D152N-conjugated oligosaccharide is not likely to be positioned near the loop tips of the interacting α-toxin, the presumed point of interaction between the α-toxin and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (44Tremeau O. Lemaire C. Drevet P. Pinkasfeld S. Ducancel F. Boulain J.-C. Menez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9362-9369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar et al., 1995). Oligosaccharide conjugation per se has only a small influence on agonist binding (4-5-fold). Similarly, glycosylation of Asn-189 in the mouse mutant α-subunit, despite its proximity to a critical Tyr-190, does not influence the binding of small ligands (Kreienkamp et al., 1994; Keller et al., 1995). This suggests some flexibility of the oligosaccharide chain and its linkage to the asparaginyl residue. It is not surprising that charge neutralization at a single position has a minimal effect on α-toxin binding. The α-toxins contain multiple positive charges, and elimination of a single negative charge on the receptor may have minimal influence on the binding kinetics, particularly if the charges contribute primarily to long-range electrostatic attractive forces. For example, x-ray crystallographic studies show that the interaction of fasciculin, a three-fingered toxin homologous to α-bungarotoxin, involves primarily hydrophobic interactions with the acetylcholinesterase surface (5Bourne Y. Taylor P. Marchot P. Cell. 1995; 83: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar et al., 1995; 19Harel M. Kleywegt G.J. Ravelli R.B.G. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 1355-1366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar et al., 1995), and mutagenesis studies indicate that a complement of hydrophobic surfaces seems most critical for high affinity binding. 1P. 3ot, C. Prowse, and P. Taylor, unpublished observations. Charge neutralization has a greater influence than glycosylation on reducing the affinity of agonists and antagonists (carbamylcholine, suberyldicholine, decamethonium, d-tubocurarine, and dimethyl-d-tubocurarine) for the receptor (Table II). All of these compounds share at least one quaternary moiety, and the elimination of a coulombic interaction is the likely shared basis for the reduction in affinity for the full agonists and antagonists. Since the reductions in affinity of the full agonists, suberyldicholine and carbamylcholine, are comparable to those found for the partial agonists and the antagonists, the mutation, leading to a generalized loss in affinity, is not specifically associated with agonist-induced changes in receptor state. Moreover, since the loss of affinity is comparable for mono- and bis-quaternary ligands, this residue probably is not primarily involved in stabilization of the second cationic site for bis-quaternary ligands. A mutation in a neighboring residue (αG153S) was found in a patient with a slow channel syndrome (Sine et al., 1995b). This mutation increases agonist affinity, resulting in a decreased rate of acetylcholine dissociation and repeated channel opening during the interval of agonist occupation. Hence, four residues in this region of adjoining sequence (Trp-149, Tyr-151, Asp-152, and Gly-153) have all provided evidence of being proximal to the binding site. The finding that the charge on Asp-152 is a major determinant of agonist and antagonist binding raises several interesting questions regarding the subunit location and disposition of residues that stabilize the quaternary ammonium-containing agonists and antagonists. In proteins containing a binding site of similar recognition capacity for quaternary ligands and whose structure has been resolved, one finds proximal aromatic residues surrounding a large portion of the quaternary ion (14Dougherty D.A. Stauffer D.A. Science. 1990; 250: 1558-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar and Stauffer, 1990), but, in addition, the site is characterized by more distant anionic residue(s) (Segal et al., 1974; 42Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (2389) Google Scholar et al., 1991). These results are consistent with short-range (1/r6) hydrophobic and longer range (1/r) electrostatic energy contributing to stabilization of quaternary ligands (13Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2319) Google Scholar, 1996). Acetylcholinesterase (Sussman et al., 1991) and the Fab fragment of an antibody binding phosphorylcholine (35Segal D.M. Padlan E.A. Cohen G.H. Rudikoff S. Potter M. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4295-4302Google Scholar et al., 1974) have their binding sites contained within a single subunit, whereas a binding site at the interface of two subunits has evolved for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Karlin and co-workers (Czajkowski et al., 1993; Martin et al., 1996) have shown that the aspartyl residues δ-Asp-180 and γ-Asp-174 are cross-linked by a bifunctional reagent to α-Cys-192 and/or α-Cys-193 and therefore must reside within 9 Å of one of the two cysteines in the α-subunit. Removal of the charge on δ-Asp-180 or γ-Asp-174 also reduces acetylcholine affinity by ∼2 orders of magnitude (Czajkowski et al., 1993; Martin et al., 1996), and these investigators suggested that the agonist spans the subunit interface. The loss of binding energy may be a consequence of the absence of an agonist-mediated change in receptor conformation to a higher affinity or desensitized state. Our studies with α-Asp-152 reopen the question of whether the electrostatic attractive forces arise from a single charged residue across the αγ- and αδ-subunit interfaces on the γ- and δ-subunits or from a residue on the α-subunit. The long-range nature of electrostatic point charges is also consistent with several charges contributing to an electrostatic field at the subunit interface. Charge neutralization at α-Asp-152 only minimally affects assembly at the αγ- and αδ-interfaces. It is not known whether the D180N mutation in the δ-subunit or D174N in the γ-subunit will influence receptor subunit assembly. In fact, mutations in α-, γ-, or δ-subunits that alter subunit alignment upon assembly could affect ligand binding by simply restricting the conformational changes induced by binding of the respective ligands to achieve high affinity or desensitized states. The cyclic diterpenes of the lophotoxin family possess an electrophilic site at C(7)-C(8) that reacts with Tyr-190 in the α-subunit (Abramson et al., 1989). Since the lophotoxin lactone structurally resembles acetylcholine, and bromoacetylcholine is known to react with Cys-192 or Cys-193 (22Karlin A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1969; 54: 245S-264SCrossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 1969), as noted previously, the ester moiety of bound acetylcholine would be expected to lie antiparallel to the amide bond in the peptide chain in this region of the α-subunit (2Abramson S.N. Trischman J.A. Tapiolas D.M. Herold E.E. Fenical W. Taylor P. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 1798-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar et al., 1991). This orientation suggests that Tyr-190 is closer to the position of the anionic charge(s) than are cysteines at positions 192 and 193; Asp-152 in the α-subunit, Asp-174/Asp-180 in the γ/δ-subunits, or both of the side chains might well lie close to α-Tyr-190."

Vascular endothelial cells respond to various neurohumoral and physical stimuli by increasing cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and releasing substances such as nitric oxide (NO), 1The abbreviations used are: NOnitric oxideIVIgimmunoglobulins for intravenous usePBSphosphate-buffered salineNOSnitric-oxide synthaseET-1endothelin-1TGthapsigargin. prostacyclin, and endothelins (1Newby A.C.

Proc. 1994; 26: 1285PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in a pig to baboon model (18Magee J.C. Collins B.H. Harland R.C. Bollinger R.R. Franck M.M. Platt J.L. Transplant. Proc. 1995; 27: 271PubMed Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated the potential contribution of natural xenoreactive antibodies on the cell mechanisms leading to endothelial cell activation. The present study was undertaken to investigate the action of IVIg and rat natural antibodies (IgG) on cytosolic Ca2+ movements and NO production elicited by thrombin in aortic endothelial cells from guinea pig. It provided evidence for the selective interaction of IVIg with thrombin receptors or signal transduction pathways, resulting in inhibition of thrombin-induced [Ca2+]i increases and NO production. It also demonstrated that rat IgG suppress the first phase of the Ca2+ response to thrombin without alteration of NO production. Endothelial cells were isolated from aorta of Hartley guinea pigs (Charles River) by digestion with 0.01% collagenase in RPMI 1640 medium for 15 min at 37°C as described previously (19Ryan U.S. Maxwell G. J. Tissue Cult. Methods. 1986; 10: 3-5Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The resulting cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2%L-glutamine, 1% Hepes, 1% sodium pyruvate, penicillin and streptomycin (100 units/ml and 100 μg/ml), 1% fungizone into 25 or 75 cm2 flasks precoated with 2% gelatin. Confluent cells (10-15 days) were detached with 0.01% trypsin-EDTA and then reseeded onto glass coverslips (9 × 35 mm) in Leighton tubes for [Ca2+]i determinations and onto plastic culture dishes (35 mm) for NO measurements. Lyophilized IVIg were provided by Baxter (Lessines, Belgium). The absence of IVIg degradation was controlled by electrophoresis on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and then IVIg were concentrated to 120 mg/ml. Rat IgG were isolated from rat Lewis decomplemented serum (20Bazin H. Beckers A. Querinjean P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1974; 4: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Briefly, sera were passed over a protein G-Sepharose column. IgG were eluted with 0.2 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.8. IgG was more than 95% pure as determined by electrophoresis on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using anti-rat Fcg (Jackson Immunoresearch). These IgG preparations were concentrated to 10 mg/ml. Endothelial cells were detached with 0.1% trypsin-EDTA solution, centrifuged at 450 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and the pellet was resuspended in PBS (Life Technologies, Cergy Pontoise, France) containing 0.01% NaN3. Cells (5.105 cells/tubes) were then incubated for 2 h at 4°C with 100 μl of different IVIg concentrations and washed twice with PBS-NaN3. The binding of human IgG anti-guinea pig endothelial cells was detected by staining the cells with β-phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (H+L) (Jackson Immunoresearch). The fluorescence of labeled cells was analyzed by FACScan (Becton Dickinson). The nonspecific binding was assessed by performing similar experiments in the presence of equivalent quantities of human albumin. Only alive cells as defined by propidium iodure staining exclusion were considered. In the range of IVIg concentrations studied, the presence of antibodies did not alter cell viability estimated as the percentage of cells excluding trypan blue or propidium iodure (>95%). Specific binding of IVIg to endothelial cells was obtained after subtraction of nonspecific binding from the total. Cytosolic free Ca2+ concentrations were determined as described previously (21Iouzalen L. Devynck M.A. David-Dufilho M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 289: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells cultured on coverslips were transferred into buffer A (in mM: NaCl 136, KCl 5, NaH2PO4 2, MgSO4 0.4, NaHCO3 4, glucose 8, Hepes 25, pH 7.4 at 37°C) containing 20% fetal calf serum, a coktail of amino acids, and 2 mM glutamine. They were first equilibrated in buffer A for 30 min at 37°C and then loaded with 2 μM fura-2-tetrakis (acetoxymethylester) for 25 min. De-esterification was completed in fresh buffer A containing 20% of fetal calf serum for 25 min at 37°C. To record fluorescence signals, cells were washed twice with buffer A, and the coverslip was inserted in a special quartz-suprasil cuvette thermostated at 37°C (22Astarie C. David-Dufilho M. Millanvoye-Van Brussel E. Freyss-Béguin M. Devynck M.A. Am. J. Hypertens. 1992; 5: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Fura-2 was excited at 340 and 380 nm, and emission was collected at 505 nm on a spectrofluorimeter SPEX CMIII (ISA-Jobin-Yvon, Longjumeau, France). Each measurement was systematically corrected for autofluorescence of unloaded cells incubated or not with different concentrations of human immunoglobulins. [Ca2+]i was calculated from the 340/380 ratios of fluorescence intensities using the equation of Grynkiewicz et al. (23Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-4350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and the previously determined Kd and calibration parameters (21Iouzalen L. Devynck M.A. David-Dufilho M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 289: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). NO release was monitored with a NO-selective microprobe (24Lantoine F. Trévin S. Bedioui F. Devynck J. J. Electroanal. Chem. 1995; 392: 85-89Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The working electrode was carbon microfiber (8-μm diameter, approximately 1-mm length), coated by tetrakis (3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl) nickel (II) porphyrin and nafion films. Differential pulse amperometry was performed with a three-electrode potentiostatic biopulse system (Tacussel, Lyon, France) as described previously (24Lantoine F. Trévin S. Bedioui F. Devynck J. J. Electroanal. Chem. 1995; 392: 85-89Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated in PBS medium complemented with 5 mM glucose and 0.5 mM MgCl2 (buffer B). The use of a micromanipulator (Biologic Instruments, Claix, France) attached to the stage of an inverted microscope (Zeiss, Germany) allowed to set the probe 10-15 μm above the cell surface, all the apparatus being enclosed in a Faraday's chamber. At the end of each experiment, internal calibration of the electrochemical sensor was performed by the addition of NO standard solutions as detailed previously (25Lantoine F. Brunet A. Bedioui F. Devynck J. Devynck M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of electrodes varied from 0.5 to 2.6 nM NO/pA (1.6 ± 0.4 nM NO/pA, n = 9). Under our experimental conditions, the detection limit was 2-5 nM NO. Identification of NO as responsible for the amperometric signal induced by 2 units/ml thrombin was checked by preincubating the cells for 5 min at 37°C with 10−3ML-arginine or 10−3M NG-monomethyl-L-arginine monoacetate. Thrombin-induced NO production was enhanced from 46 ± 15 up to 94 ± 10 nM by L-Arg pretreatment (n = 3) and decreased to 6.7 ± 3.3 nM in NG-monomethyl-L-arginine monoacetate-treated cells (n = 3). In aortic endothelial cells from guinea pig, thrombin induced a biphasic increase in [Ca2+]i: a transient peak occurring 15-20 s after stimulation followed by a long lasting plateau (Fig. 1A). NO production paralleled the rise of [Ca2+]i. NO concentration reached a maximum within 15-20 s after thrombin addition (32 ± 6 nM, n = 9) and remained above basal level for a few minutes (Fig. 1A). Incubation of cells for 5 min at 37°C with 10 mg/ml IVIg or rat IgG followed by a washing to remove unbound antibodies from the incubation medium did not change basal [Ca2+]i values (Fig. 1, B and C) but altered the Ca2+ response to thrombin. This IVIg pretreatment prevented thrombin from significantly increasing [Ca2+]i and producing NO (Fig. 1B). Rat IgG pretreatment also suppressed the [Ca2+]i peak elicited by thrombin but increased the amplitude of the sustained [Ca2+]i rise from 56 ± 13 to 138 ± 27 nM (n = 5 and 12) and the NO production from 32 ± 4 to 52 ± 4 nM (n = 5) (Fig. 1C). For [Ca2+]i measurements only, we could compare the response to thrombin in cells pretreated by 10 mg/ml IVIg whether they were removed or not from the incubation medium before stimulation. Under these two conditions, the amplitude of [Ca2+]i rise at peak was reduced by 85% on average and that at plateau by 70%. This indicates that the IVIg effects we saw were mainly due to their binding on endothelial cells and not to their direct interactions with thrombin in the extracellular medium. This is confirmed by the observation that the dose-dependent inhibitions of IVIg on thrombin-induced Ca2+ movements and NO production (Fig. 2, A and B) paralleled their specific binding to guinea pig endothelial cells (Fig. 2C). Both maximal inhibitory effects and binding were reached at approximately 10 mg/ml. To investigate the possible interaction of IVIg with other membrane receptors or with Ca2+ pathways activated by Ca2+ store depletion, endothelial cells were stimulated either by ATP, endothelin-1, or thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pumps. [Ca2+]i transiently increased after 0.5 mM ATP addition, returned to basal values, and then slowly rose to a plateau (Fig. 3, upper panels, trace a). Preincubation of cells with 10 mg/ml IVIg suppressed the first phase of ATP-induced Ca2+ signal but modified neither the time course nor the amplitude of the late Ca2+ response (Fig. 3, upper panels, trace b). The Ca2+ movements elicited by endothelin-1 and thapsigargin were not altered by pretreatment with IVIg (Fig. 3, middle and lower panels). Concerning NO release, results similar to those obtained for Ca2+ movements were observed except for ATP. Both endothelin-1 and thapsigargin elicited NO synthesis (Fig. 4). This production of NO was similar in cells pretreated or not with 10 mg/ml IVIg. In contrast, ATP, which increased [Ca2+]i, did not produce any detectable NO at the cell surface (Fig. 4, upper panel).Fig. 4ATP-, endothelin-1-, and thapsigargin-activated NO production in control and IVIg-treated cells. Cells were preincubated for 5 min at 37°C with either vehicle or 10 mg/ml IVIg and then washed to record the electric signal resulting from NO. Cells were stimulated by 0.5 mM ATP, 1 μM ET-1, or 1 μM TG as indicated by the arrows. Left panels, representative recordings of NO producted at surface of control cells.

Naruse M. Hoover R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 171-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Activation of the endothelial cells have been recently shown to be a major mechanism at play in the genesis of hyperacute xenograft rejection (26Blakely M. Van der Werf W. Berndt M. Dalmasso A. Bach F. Hancock W. Transplantation. 1994; 58: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that natural antibodies alter the metabolism of Ca2+ ions, one of the most important second messengers for cell activation. Human and rat natural antibodies did not modify per se the cytosolic Ca2+ level in aortic endothelial cells from guinea pig but did modulate the Ca2+ movements elicited by thrombin, a protease generated at sites of vascular injury. The observation that these effects still appeared after removal of antibodies from the incubation medium suggests interactions with specific targets on endothelial cells rather than immunological interferences with thrombin itself. Human IVIg prevented both the biphasic Ca2+ response and the NO production, whereas the rat natural IgG suppressed the first phase of the Ca2+ response but increased the sustained [Ca2+]i elevation and the NO concentration ([NO]). These distinct actions on Ca2+ pathways and NO production suggest the presence of different binding sites for IVIg and rat IgG on endothelial cell membrane. This is supported by the lack of effect of IVIg pretreatment on rat IgG binding to guinea pig endothelial cells (results not shown). Our results also underline the functional difference between rat IgG and human IVIg. The binding of antidonor antibodies to blood vessels of the xenograft occurs early in the rejection process (16Magee J.C. Platt J.L. Ther. Immunol. 1994; 1: 45-58PubMed Google Scholar), whereas purified human immunoglobulins reduce the cytotoxic activity of recipient serum in different discordant xenograft models (17Latremouille C. Transplant. Proc. 1994; 26: 1285PubMed Google Scholar, 18Magee J.C. Collins B.H. Harland R.C. Bollinger R.R. Franck M.M. Platt J.L. Transplant. Proc. 1995; 27: 271PubMed Google Scholar). From the present observations it may be proposed that binding of rat IgG to guinea pig endothelial cells induce cell contraction by amplifying the sustained Ca2+ response to thrombin. In contrast, the binding of IVIg to guinea pig endothelial cells may delay the cell activation and retraction by reducing the thrombin-induced Ca2+ movements. Thrombin has indeed been demonstrated to cause a marked retraction of confluent endothelial cells coincident with the sustained phase of [Ca2+]i response and paralleled by the formation of gaps in F-actin distribution (4Goligorsky M.S. Menton D.N. Laszlo A. Lum H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16771-16775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The retraction of endothelial cells leads to disruption of the cell monolayer thereby altering the vascular function. In vascular endothelial cells, the temporal and causal relationships between rise in [Ca2+]i and NO production have mostly been investigated with indirect methods. The production of cGMP, considered to be the cytosolic effector of NO, appears to be directly related to the cytosolic Ca2+ level (7Gosink E.C. Forsberg E.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1620-C1629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lückoff A. Pohl U. Mülsch A. Busse R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1988; 95: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 28Korenaga R. Ando J. Ohtsuka A. Sakuma I. Yang W. Toyo-oka T. Kamiya A. Cell Struct. Funct. 1993; 18: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This was explained by the Ca2+/calmodulin dependence of NO synthase (NOS) activity (for review see 29Knowles R. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2516) Google Scholar). A few direct measurement of [NO] has investigated the relations of NO production to [Ca2+]i rises. The participation of Ca2+/calmodulin in a step of NO synthesis has been also demonstrated by detection of [NO] with an amperometric NO sensor similar to the Clark type electrode for oxygen (30Tsukahara H. Gordienko D. Goligorsky M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 722-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Simultaneous measurements of [Ca2+]i and [NO] with a porphyrinic microsensor have indicated that the increase in [NO] outlasted the [Ca2+]i transient (8Groschner K. Graier W.F. Kukovetz W.R. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 304-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our study showed by real time measurement of [NO] with a porphyrinic microelectrode that thrombin, ET-1, and thapsigargin paralelly increased [Ca2+]i and NO in accordance with the activation of NOS by Ca2+/calmodulin. However, ATP elicited a clear biphasic Ca2+ response without any detectable [NO], indicating that this Ca2+ rise was nonsufficient for triggering NO production. The [NO] we detected here were in the same range as those previously reported with the Clark type electrode (30Tsukahara H. Gordienko D. Goligorsky M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 722-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) but 10-fold lower than those obtained by Malinski's group in response to supraphysiological bradykinin concentration (8Groschner K. Graier W.F. Kukovetz W.R. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 304-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A parallel between [Ca2+]i rises; cGMP formation and nitrite/nitrate production has been clearly demonstrated for thapsigargin and for an agonist of nonisopeptide-selective endothelin B receptor (31Hirata Y.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5647-5665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), whereas the results obtained with ATP are less obvious. The question of whether the ATP-induced early cGMP accumulation was dependent on or independent of the NOS activation remains an open question because discordant effects of NOS inhibitors on nitrite and cGMP accumulation have been reported (7Gosink E.C. Forsberg E.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1620-C1629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Wang Y. Soo Shin W. Kawaguchi H. Inukai M. Kato M. Sakamoto A. Uehara Y. Miyamoto M. Shimamoto N. Korenaga R. Ando J. Toyo-oka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5647-5665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The present study showed that the inhibitory effect of IVIg on Ca2+ movements and NO production depended on the substance stimulating the guinea pig endothelial cells. No effect was observed in cells treated with thapsigargin or with high ET-1 concentrations, although both stimuli increased [Ca2+]i and NO production. Thapsigargin-elicited Ca2+ movements have been demonstrated to be phospholipase C-independent (6Dolor R.J. Hurwitz L.M. Mirza Z. Strauss H.C. Whorton A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C171-C181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and ET-1-induced activation of the constitutive NOS appears to be dependent on Ca2+/calmodulin and protein tyrosine kinase (33Tsukahara H. Ende H. Magazine H. Bahou W. Goligorsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21778-21785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that interactions of IVIg with Ca2+ pathways depend on phospholipase C activation. This proposal agrees with the suppression by IVIg of the first phase of Ca2+ response to thrombin and ATP. This first step has been clearly demonstrated to be mediated by phospholipase C (for review see 34Berridge M. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). The inhibitory action of human IVIg and rat IgG on this first phase of Ca2+ signals could therefore be mediated at least in part through the interactions of natural antibodies with phospholipase C. Furthermore, our results also indicated that the action of human IVIg and rat IgG on NO production is more likely related to their effects on the sustained phase of agonist-induced [Ca2+]i elevations. This agrees with a recent study demonstrating a clear relationship between nitrite production and sustained [Ca2+]i elevation (32Wang Y. Soo Shin W. Kawaguchi H. Inukai M. Kato M. Sakamoto A. Uehara Y. Miyamoto M. Shimamoto N. Korenaga R. Ando J. Toyo-oka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5647-5665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The inhibition of the initial Ca2+ response to agonists seems to be a common feature of natural antibodies, whereas their action on the sustained [Ca2+]i rise and NO production appears to reveal their specificity. The present study indicates that natural antibodies are capable of modulating Ca2+ homeostasis and NO production in stimulated endothelial cells. Their mechanisms of action remains to be better defined. Future studies must be directed toward the action of natural antibodies on the metabolism of intracellular messengers associated to phospholipase C activation and on the production of vasoactive factors of endothelial origin."

Academic Press, New York1987: 131Google Scholar). This enzyme is an important enzyme involved in regulation and synthesis in complex ways (1Andrews T.J. Lorimer G.H. The Biochemistry of Plants. Vol 10. Academic Press, New York1987: 131Google Scholar). Cells of green plants contain 50-100 chloroplasts, each of which has 20-900 copies of the genome (2Mullet J.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 39: 475-502Crossref Google Scholar). Because of these large numbers, cells can synthesize much enzyme rapidly. Rubisco from some bacteria and eukaryotes is composed of eight large (L) and eight small (S) subunits (3Akazawa T. Encyclopedia of Plant Physiology. Vol 6. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1979: 208Google Scholar). The gene for L is encoded in the plastid genome, and 4-13 S genes compose the multigene family in higher plants (4Manzara T. Gruissem W. Photosynth.

A multigene family of S subunits in plants probably facilitates fine tuning of the rate of synthesis of these subunits relative to L subunits (5Dean C. Dunsmuir P. Bedbrook J. Tailoring Genes for Crop Improvement: An Agricultural Perspective. Plenum Press, New York1987: 59Crossref Google Scholar). All S genes are expressed in green leaves of plants.

We analyzed the crystal structure of spinach Rubisco at 1.8-Å resolution to answer the question.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe results of the structure analysis of the four pairs of an L subunit with an S subunit in an asymmetric unit of the crystal lattice are shown in Table I. While refining the structures, we found that the side chain skeletons of some residues in the S subunits, reported by Martin (23Martin P.G. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1979; 6: 401-408Google Scholar), deviate significantly from our electron density maps, especially at residue 56, and that the shapes of the maps of the four crystallographically independent small subunits, named as S1, S2, S3, and S4, were different. Examination of the electron density maps suggested that residue 56 in S1 and S3 was leucine instead of the aspartate reported elsewhere (23Martin P.G. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1979; 6: 401-408Google Scholar) and that residue 56 in S2 and S4 was histidine (Fig. 1). The electron density maps at residue 93 suggested further structural differences; the reported alanine side chains of S2 and S4 fit the maps well, but S1 and S3 had a much longer side chain at this position (the residue could not be identified). Still other differences were observed in residue 8. These findings are evidence that spinach Rubisco had two S chains. Two-dimensional electrophoresis showed two peptides of S with one L peptide (Fig. 2) as reported before (24Ren L. Salnikow J. Vater J. Plant Sci. 1991; 74: 1-6Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). With the pI of L taken to be 6.13, as calculated from the reported amino acid sequence (25Zurawski G. Perrot B. Bottomley W. Whitfeld P.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3251-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) with GENETYX-MAX, Version 8 (Software Development Co., Ltd.), the pI points of the two S peptides were 6.10 and 6.42. The observed difference in the pIs was partly due to the residue at position 56 being leucine in one peptide and histidine in the other. This difference should give rise to a difference in the pI of 0.13. The larger difference (0.32) actually found might be explained by other differences in the amino acid residues at positions 8 and 93 or elsewhere; these could not be identified in this study. Thus, the results of x-ray diffraction analysis showed that spinach Rubisco had two kinds of small subunits: SI, with Leu-56, and SII, with His-56. Spinach Rubisco, therefore, has a L8SI4SII4 structure, not L8S8 as reported before (11Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.-I. Science. 1989; 244: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Knight S. Anderson I. Brändén C.-I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 13Taylor T.C.

Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), which would be possible only if Rubisco were composed of eight identical large subunits and eight identical small subunits. Our x-ray results showed that what might be the 4-fold symmetry of spinach Rubisco was broken by the heterogeneity of the S subunits. The same kind of small subunits occupies the positions furthest from each other, maintaining 2-fold symmetry along the central core.Fig. 3Schematic drawing of the L8SI4SII4 structure. The SI and SII subunits are shown as green and yellow stick models, respectively. The white dots show the Cα atoms of the eight large subunits. There are three 2-fold axes in the spinach Rubisco molecule; one of them corresponds to a crystallographic axis (red), and the others are noncrystallographic axes (white). This drawing was prepared using MidasPlus (30Ferrin T.E. Huang C.C. Jarvis L.E. Langridge R. J. Mol. Graphics. 1988; 6: 13-27Crossref Scopus (927) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Nε atom of His-56 in the SII subunits forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen atom of Glu-259 in the neighboring large subunit (Fig. 1). On the other hand, the side chain of Leu-56 of the SI subunits does not interact electrostatically. The additional SIIHis-56Nε-LGlu-259-O hydrogen bond must cause the difference in the dissociation constants; the L-SII interaction must be more stable because of the hydrogen bond between His-56 and Glu-259, and the SII subunit will construct the L-S pair more readily than SI. In this context, it is interesting to recall the finding that a highly conserved sequence of 16 amino acids, including that at position 56, is essential for the assembly of L and S in the plant enzyme (26Wasmann C.C. Ramage R.T. Bohnert H.J. Ostrem J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1198-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).In terms of its different interactions of the two S subunits, L also may be of two kinds; the structure of spinach Rubisco may be {(LI/LI)2SI4}{(LII/LII)2SII4}, where LII is the L that has the SIIHis-56-LGlu-259 hydrogen bond and LI does not have such a bond, and LI/LI and LII/LII are mean L2 dimers (12Knight S. Anderson I. Brändén C.-I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) formed by the same kind of large subunits. LGlu-259 participates in a dimer-dimer interaction with LArg-258 in the neighboring L2 dimer and may be involved in the transfer of signals of an L2 dimer to the next one. Plant Rubisco gradually decreases in activity to a constant level during reaction (17Yokota A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The decrease is smaller if there is binding of the substrate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate to the noncatalytic substrate-binding sites (27Yokota A. Wadano A. Murayama H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Binding of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate to these sites proceeds cooperatively; binding to the first four sites suppresses binding to the remaining four sites (28Yokota A. Higashioka M. Taira T. Usuda H. Wadano A. Murayama H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1994; 35: 317-321Google Scholar, 29Yokota A. Higashioka M. Wadano A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The grouping of eight large and eight small subunits into two different structures as described above may give an account for the cooperativity in plant Rubisco. Thus, a multigene family for S may be related to a genetic mechanism that has given the enzyme the ability to fine tune its own catalysis. INTRODUCTIONRibulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco, 1The abbreviations used are: Rubiscoribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenasePEGpolyethylene glycolBicineN,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. EC 4.1.1.39) is the key enzyme catalyzing the primary reactions in photosynthesis as well as photorespiration (1Andrews T.J. Lorimer G.H. The Biochemistry of Plants. Vol 10. Academic Press, New York1987: 131Google Scholar). This enzyme is an important enzyme involved in regulation and synthesis in complex ways (1Andrews T.J. Lorimer G.H. The Biochemistry of Plants. Vol 10. Academic Press, New York1987: 131Google Scholar). Cells of green plants contain 50-100 chloroplasts, each of which has 20-900 copies of the genome (2Mullet J.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 39: 475-502Crossref Google Scholar). Because of these large numbers, cells can synthesize much enzyme rapidly. Rubisco from some bacteria and eukaryotes is composed of eight large (L) and eight small (S) subunits (3Akazawa T. Encyclopedia of Plant Physiology. Vol 6. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1979: 208Google Scholar). The gene for L is encoded in the plastid genome, and 4-13 S genes compose the multigene family in higher plants (4Manzara T. Gruissem W. Photosynth. Res. 1988; 16: 117-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A multigene family of S subunits in plants probably facilitates fine tuning of the rate of synthesis of these subunits relative to L subunits (5Dean C. Dunsmuir P. Bedbrook J. Tailoring Genes for Crop Improvement: An Agricultural Perspective. Plenum Press, New York1987: 59Crossref Google Scholar). All S genes are expressed in green leaves of plants. The multiplicity in the genome construction may make possible transitory, organ-specific, or signal-specific expression of different genes that have individual promoters (6Meier I. Callan K.L.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe results of the structure analysis of the four pairs of an L subunit with an S subunit in an asymmetric unit of the crystal lattice are shown in Table I. While refining the structures, we found that the side chain skeletons of some residues in the S subunits, reported by Martin (23Martin P.G. Aust. J.

Examination of the electron density maps suggested that residue 56 in S1 and S3 was leucine instead of the aspartate reported elsewhere (23Martin P.G. Aust. J.

The electron density maps at residue 93 suggested further structural differences; the reported alanine side chains of S2 and S4 fit the maps well, but S1 and S3 had a much longer side chain at this position (the residue could not be identified). Still other differences were observed in residue 8. These findings are evidence that spinach Rubisco had two S chains. Two-dimensional electrophoresis showed two peptides of S with one L peptide (Fig. 2) as reported before (24Ren L. Salnikow J. Vater J. Plant Sci. 1991; 74: 1-6Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). With the pI of L taken to be 6.13, as calculated from the reported amino acid sequence (25Zurawski G. Perrot B. Bottomley W. Whitfeld P.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3251-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) with GENETYX-MAX, Version 8 (Software Development Co., Ltd.), the pI points of the two S peptides were 6.10 and 6.42. The observed difference in the pIs was partly due to the residue at position 56 being leucine in one peptide and histidine in the other. This difference should give rise to a difference in the pI of 0.13. The larger difference (0.32) actually found might be explained by other differences in the amino acid residues at positions 8 and 93 or elsewhere; these could not be identified in this study. Thus, the results of x-ray diffraction analysis showed that spinach Rubisco had two kinds of small subunits: SI, with Leu-56, and SII, with His-56. Spinach Rubisco, therefore, has a L8SI4SII4 structure, not L8S8 as reported before (11Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.-I.

On the other hand, the side chain of Leu-56 of the SI subunits does not interact electrostatically. The additional SIIHis-56Nε-LGlu-259-O hydrogen bond must cause the difference in the dissociation constants; the L-SII interaction must be more stable because of the hydrogen bond between His-56 and Glu-259, and the SII subunit will construct the L-S pair more readily than SI. In this context, it is interesting to recall the finding that a highly conserved sequence of 16 amino acids, including that at position 56, is essential for the assembly of L and S in the plant enzyme (26Wasmann C.C.

A. 1989; 86: 1198-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).In terms of its different interactions of the two S subunits, L also may be of two kinds; the structure of spinach Rubisco may be {(LI/LI)2SI4}{(LII/LII)2SII4}, where LII is the L that has the SIIHis-56-LGlu-259 hydrogen bond and LI does not have such a bond, and LI/LI and LII/LII are mean L2 dimers (12Knight S.

LGlu-259 participates in a dimer-dimer interaction with LArg-258 in the neighboring L2 dimer and may be involved in the transfer of signals of an L2 dimer to the next one. Plant Rubisco gradually decreases in activity to a constant level during reaction (17Yokota A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The decrease is smaller if there is binding of the substrate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate to the noncatalytic substrate-binding sites (27Yokota A. Wadano A. Murayama H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Binding of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate to these sites proceeds cooperatively; binding to the first four sites suppresses binding to the remaining four sites (28Yokota A. Higashioka M. Taira T. Usuda H.

The observed difference in the pIs was partly due to the residue at position 56 being leucine in one peptide and histidine in the other. This difference should give rise to a difference in the pI of 0.13. The larger difference (0.32) actually found might be explained by other differences in the amino acid residues at positions 8 and 93 or elsewhere; these could not be identified in this study. Thus, the results of x-ray diffraction analysis showed that spinach Rubisco had two kinds of small subunits: SI, with Leu-56, and SII, with His-56. Spinach Rubisco, therefore, has a L8SI4SII4 structure, not L8S8 as reported before (11Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.-I. Science. 1989; 244: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Knight S. Anderson I. Brändén C.-I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 13Taylor T.C. Andersson I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the L8SI4SII4 structure schematically. Earlier spinach Rubisco was described as having D4 point symmetry (11Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.-I. Science. 1989; 244: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Knight S. Anderson I. Brändén C.-I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 13Taylor T.C. Andersson I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), which would be possible only if Rubisco were composed of eight identical large subunits and eight identical small subunits. Our x-ray results showed that what might be the 4-fold symmetry of spinach Rubisco was broken by the heterogeneity of the S subunits. The same kind of small subunits occupies the positions furthest from each other, maintaining 2-fold symmetry along the central core. The Nε atom of His-56 in the SII subunits forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen atom of Glu-259 in the neighboring large subunit (Fig. 1). On the other hand, the side chain of Leu-56 of the SI subunits does not interact electrostatically. The additional SIIHis-56Nε-LGlu-259-O hydrogen bond must cause the difference in the dissociation constants; the L-SII interaction must be more stable because of the hydrogen bond between His-56 and Glu-259, and the SII subunit will construct the L-S pair more readily than SI. In this context, it is interesting to recall the finding that a highly conserved sequence of 16 amino acids, including that at position 56, is essential for the assembly of L and S in the plant enzyme (26Wasmann C.C. Ramage R.T. Bohnert H.J. Ostrem J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1198-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In terms of its different interactions of the two S subunits, L also may be of two kinds; the structure of spinach Rubisco may be {(LI/LI)2SI4}{(LII/LII)2SII4}, where LII is the L that has the SIIHis-56-LGlu-259 hydrogen bond and LI does not have such a bond, and LI/LI and LII/LII are mean L2 dimers (12Knight S. Anderson I. Brändén C.-I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) formed by the same kind of large subunits. LGlu-259 participates in a dimer-dimer interaction with LArg-258 in the neighboring L2 dimer and may be involved in the transfer of signals of an L2 dimer to the next one. Plant Rubisco gradually decreases in activity to a constant level during reaction (17Yokota A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The decrease is smaller if there is binding of the substrate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate to the noncatalytic substrate-binding sites (27Yokota A. Wadano A. Murayama H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Binding of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate to these sites proceeds cooperatively; binding to the first four sites suppresses binding to the remaining four sites (28Yokota A. Higashioka M. Taira T. Usuda H. Wadano A. Murayama H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1994; 35: 317-321Google Scholar, 29Yokota A. Higashioka M. Wadano A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The grouping of eight large and eight small subunits into two different structures as described above may give an account for the cooperativity in plant Rubisco. Thus, a multigene family for S may be related to a genetic mechanism that has given the enzyme the ability to fine tune its own catalysis. We thank N. Sakabe and A.

Soluble β-globin showed low (16 kDa) and high molecular mass (32 kDa) forms that could be separated by gel filtration chromatography.

Disulfide-bonded β-globin dimers showed a slight increase in thermal stability compared with β-globin; however, dimers were still more unstable than tetrameric Hb A.

The development of molecular biological techniques to replace selectively individual amino acids has helped further our understanding of the relationship between structure and function of hemoglobin. Initial reports described production of normal and modified human β-globin in bacteria employing a fusion protein expression vector (1Nagai K. Thogerson H.C. Nature. 1984; 309: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). An expression system was later developed in which α- and β-globin chains were coexpressed, resulting in formation of soluble tetrameric hemoglobin in yeast (2Wagenbach M. O'Rourke K. Vitez L.

Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recent studies described coexpression of human α- and β-globin in Escherichia coli, which resulted in formation of soluble tetrameric hemoglobins (4Hoffman S.J. Looker D.L. Roehrich J.M. Cozart P.E. Durfee S.L. Tedesco J.L. Stetler G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8521-8525Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), as well as a system for high expression of insoluble β-globin chains in E. coli. (5Hernan R.A. Hui H.L. Andracki M.E. Noble R.W. Sligar S.G. Walder J.A. Walder R.Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8619-8628Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These last two systems, however, result in globin chains containing N-terminal methionine, which may affect functional properties of hemoglobin. More recently, Shen et al. (6Shen T-J. Ho N.T. Simplaceanu V. Zou M. Green B.N. Tam M.F. Ho C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8108-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) expressed soluble hemoglobin tetramers lacking N-terminal methionine in bacteria by coexpression of α- and β-globin cDNAs with methionine aminopeptidase cDNA. In order to further the understanding of hemoglobin assembly and folding, production of soluble single-chain hemoglobin variants is critical; however, expression of recombinant, soluble, individual globin chains has not been realized to date (4Hoffman S.J. Looker D.L. Roehrich J.M. Cozart P.E. Durfee S.L. Tedesco J.L. Stetler G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8521-8525Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 5Hernan R.A. Hui H.L.

Protein Chem. 1991; 10: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Globins expressed in cells with and without additional hemin often form insoluble inclusion bodies that require harsh denaturing conditions for solubilization. After solubilization, chains must then be renatured in vitro and form correctly folded native globin chains, which then must properly assemble to form authentic hemoglobin tetramers (1Nagai K. Thogerson H.C. Nature. 1984; 309: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 7Groebe D.R. Busch M.R. Tsao T.Y.M. Luh F.Y. Tam M.F. Chung A.E. Gaskell M. Liebhaber S.A. Ho C.

This process is labor intensive, and efficiency of tetramer reconstitution from denatured globin chains is very low. These limitations have made it impractical to produce efficiently modified soluble authentic β-globin chains in order to study assembly in vitro with α chains. In this report, we describe expression of soluble authentic β-globin employing an E. coli expression system that contains cDNAs for human β-globin and methionine aminopeptidase. In addition, we describe efficient assembly in vitro of purified β- with α-globin to form hemoglobin tetramers and, furthermore, report results on effects of β-β dimerization on thermal stability and assembly in vitro with α-globin. The original pHE2 plasmid (kindly provided by Drs. C. Ho and T-J. Shen, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA) was constructed to coexpress α- and β-globin chains with methionine aminopeptidase (10Ben-Bassat A. Bauer K. Chang S.-Y. Myambo K. Boosman A. Chang S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 751-757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) under transcriptional control of a tac promoter in order to obtain soluble authentic human Hb A without N-terminal methionine (6Shen T-J. Ho N.T. Simplaceanu V. Zou M. Green B.N. Tam M.F. Ho C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8108-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In order to achieve expression of authentic β-globin chain alone, the α-globin cDNA was removed from pHE2 by digestion with XbaI (Life Technologies, Inc.), the 6.3-kilobase pair fragment, which contains β-globin and methionine aminopeptidase cDNAs, was purified using a Geneclean II kit (BIO 101, Inc.) and ligated by incubation with T4 DNA ligase (Life Technologies, Inc.). A diagram of the β-globin-expressing plasmid pHE2β is shown in Fig. 1. The plasmid was transfected into E. coli (JM 109) (Promega Co., Madison, WI), and bacteria were grown at 30°C with shaking at 225 rpm in 6 liters of TB (terrific broth) containing 100 μM ampicillin to a density of about 3 × 1010 bacteria/ml. β-Globin chain expression was induced for 6 h at 30°C by addition of 0.2 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ), and cultures were then supplemented with 10 μM hemin (Aldrich) and 0.1% (w/v) glucose. After the 6-h incubation, bacterial cultures were saturated with CO gas to convert expressed β-globin to the CO form. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,300 × g for 10 min, resuspended in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.6, lysed by sonication at 4°C, and then centrifuged at 4°C for 45 min at 27,000 × g. Soluble β-globin chains were purified as described below at 4°C, and CO gas was introduced at each purification step to maintain β-globin in the CO form. The supernatant was applied to a DEAE-cellulose (Sigma) column equilibrated with 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.6, the column was washed with 5 column volumes of buffer, and then fractions were eluted with 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.3. The partially purified β-globin fraction was rechromatographed on a Mono Q column equilibrated with 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.6, and was further purified with a linear gradient from 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.6, to 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.3. The purified soluble β-globin was then concentrated by Centriprep 10 (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) and stored at −70°C. Separation of polymeric and monomeric forms of β-globin was achieved by gel filtration on a Superose 12 column in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Authentic human α- and β-globin chains were purified from tetrameric Hb A isolated from erythrocyte lysates according to previously described methods (11Ikeda-Saito M. Inubushi T. Yonetani T. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Removal of p-mercuribenzoate was accomplished using 20 mM DTT, 1The abbreviations used are: DTTdithiothreitolHbhemoglobinHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyES-MSelectrospray mass spectrometryPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and globin chains were isolated by gel filtration on a Superose 12 column. dithiothreitol hemoglobin high performance liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Molecular mass and sample purity were assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) as described (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204097) Google Scholar). In addition, mass determination was done to confirm independently results from SDS-PAGE and to evaluate N-terminal methionine cleavage from β-globin chains. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ES-MS) was performed on a VG BioQ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Altrincham, Cheshire, United Kingdom) (13Shackleton C.H. Witkowska H.E. Desiderio D.M. Mass Spectrometry: Clinical and Biomedical Applications. Vol 2. Plenum Press, New York1994: 135Google Scholar). The multiply charged ions derived from α-globin (Mr 15,126.4) served as an internal or external standard for mass scale calibration when analyzing Hb A and β-globin proteins, respectively. MS/MS experiments were performed on peptides collected in the course of a narrow bore, reversed-phase HPLC/ESMS analysis of the tryptic digest derived from DTT-treated fraction 1 (Fig. 2). Doubly charged molecular ions at 1030 and 1038 m/z corresponding to βT5 and its oxidized form, respectively, were utilized as processor ions in the process of collision-induced dissociation. Argon pressure was 10−3 mbar, collision energy was 25 V, and 5.9-s MS-2 scans were acquired between 180 and 2100 m/z in continuum mode. Data analysis employed the MassLynx® software package (Micromass, Altrincham, Cheshire, UK). Globin samples were also precipitated with acid (HCl) acetone (14Ascoli F. Rossi-Fanelli M.R. Antonini E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 72-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), dissolved in 6 M guanidine/ammonium bicarbonate buffer, and subjected to tryptic digestion. Resulting peptides were analyzed by narrow bore, reversed-phase HPLC/ES-MS (15Schroeder W.A. Hancock W.S. CRC Handbook of HPLC for the Separation of Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins. Vol II. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1984: 287Google Scholar, 16Witkowska H.E. Bitsch F. Shackleton C.H.L. Hemoglobin. 1993; 17: 227-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Purified β-globin chains were also analyzed by cellulose acetate electrophoresis, and mobilities were compared with those of authentic human globin chains. Analysis of hemoglobin tetramer formation in vitro using purified β-globin and α-globin prepared from human red blood cells was done using cellulose acetate electrophoresis on Titan III membranes at pH 8.6 with Super-Heme buffer (Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX). Absorption spectra of the purified β-globin in the CO form was recorded using a Hitachi U-2000 spectrophotometer. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of hemoglobins were recorded using an Aviv-model 62DS instrument employing a 0.1-cm light path cuvette at ∼10 μM hemoglobin concentrations, and temperature was controlled with a thermoelectric module. Thermal stability of globin chains in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, was evaluated by monitoring temperature-induced changes in ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of time at 60°C. β-Globin chains in the CO form (5 μg) purified from human red blood cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 unit of bovine liver catalase (Sigma) and then assessed for β-β dimer formation. β-Globin was also incubated for 0.5 h at 25°C in the presence of various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (Sigma), and dimer formation was quantitated by SDS-PAGE using a densitometer (Helena Laboratories). Soluble human β-globin was expressed in E. coli and purified by a combination of two anion-exchange chromatography steps using DEAE-cellulose and Mono Q. Approximate yield of soluble purified β-globin was 2-3 mg/liter culture, which represents about 40% of the yield when β chains are coexpressed with α chains to form soluble tetrameric Hb A using the same conditions. The β-globin fraction eluted as a single peak from Mono Q chromatography; however, SDS-PAGE showed two major bands of 16 and 32 kDa (data not shown). Further purification of the single peak from Mono Q chromatography using Superose 12 gel filtration chromatography showed at least two components (Fig. 2). SDS-PAGE of fraction 1 (Fr. 1) showed a diffuse doublet with molecular mass corresponding to about 32 kDa (Fig. 3). Presence of the higher molecular mass species of the doublet near 32 kDa was not consistent and varied depending on batch. On the other hand, fraction 2 (Fr. 2) migrated as a single band on SDS-PAGE with a molecular mass of about 16 kDa, which corresponds to that of authentic human β-globin chain. Treatment of fraction 1 with 50 mM DTT for 1 h resulted in complete conversion of the 32-kDa to a 16-kDa form, which comigrated on SDS-PAGE with the 16-kDa band of fraction 2; DTT treatment of fraction 2 had no effect on band migration on SDS-PAGE. These results suggest that fraction 1 contains β-globin homodimers linked by an intermolecular disulfide bond, while fraction 2 corresponds to monomeric β-globin. Electrospray mass spectrometry of fraction 1 revealed two species: a major one of 31,733.8 Da and a minor one of 31,768.4 Da (Fig. 4, top). Molecular mass of the major species corresponds to the expected mass of a disulfide-bonded human β-globin dimer (Mr 31,732.4). The minor species shows a 34.6-Da mass increment over the major component, consistent with addition of two oxygen atoms per β-β-globin chain. The minor species may correspond to the higher molecular weight band in the doublet observed in SDS-PAGE. Addition of DTT to fraction 1 resulted in conversion of both dimeric species to their monomeric counterparts. SDS-PAGE revealed a single band at ∼16 kDa, while ESMS analysis detected two species. As illustrated in Fig. 4, lower panel, DTT-treated fraction 1 contains a major component of 15,867.1 Da that corresponds to βA-globin (Mr 15,867.2) and a minor component (15,886.5 Da), which is consistent with an addition of one oxygen atom to β-globin. This result also indicates complete cleavage of the N-terminal, chain-initiating methionine from β-globin in bacteria by the coexpressed methionine aminopeptidase. The normal human β-globin chain contains two cysteine residues at β93 and at β112, within tryptic peptides βT10 (β83-95) and βT12 (β105-120), respectively. In order to identify which cysteine was involved in disulfide bond formation during protein expression and/or purification, monomeric and dimeric β-globin fractions were subjected to proteolytic digestion with trypsin, and peptides were separated and identified by HPLC/ES-MS analysis. In the digests derived from both β-β dimer and its DTT-reduced monomeric form, the following cysteine-containing peptides were observed, all at low levels: βT10, βT10-βT10 and βT10-βT12. At the same time, peptides βT12 and βT12-βT12 (encompassing Cysβ112) were not detected in any of the digests. Presence of βT10-βT10 and βT10-βT12 peptides in a digest derived from the DTT-reduced globin implies that these disulfide-bonded species are products of nonspecific oxidation, likely occurring during proteolytic digestion and/or handling of peptide mixtures; this phenomenon was noted previously by others (17Nakanishi T. Kishikawa M. Shimizu A. Hayashi A. Inoue F. J. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 30: 1663-1670Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, no difference in relative abundance of βT10-βT10 and βT10-βT12 was seen when comparing the tryptic digests derived from β-globin dimer and monomer. It can then be inferred that neither βT10-βT10 nor βT10-βT12 represents a major dimerization site in the β-β-globin. Thus, since the above results argue against Cysβ93 being a primary site of an intermolecular disulfide bond formation, it follows that Cysβ112 must be involved in the dimerization event. So far, we were unable to unequivocally prove this due to difficulties in handling and detection of the core βT12 peptide (15Schroeder W.A. Hancock W.S. CRC Handbook of HPLC for the Separation of Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins. Vol II. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1984: 287Google Scholar, 16Witkowska H.E. Bitsch F. Shackleton C.H.L. Hemoglobin. 1993; 17: 227-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Experiments are now in progress to mutagenize Cysβ112 to evaluate effects on dimer formation. While peptide mapping left some ambiguity regarding the site of dimerization, it confirmed the faithfulness of β-globin expression and provided evidence regarding the nature of a 34.6-Da addition to the β-globin dimer. Specifically, complete cleavage of the N-terminal methionine was substantiated by detection of an authentic N-terminal βT1 peptide, while the putative extended Met-βT1 was absent in the digest. In accord with detection of putative oxygenated β-globin species (Fig. 4, top and bottom), a peptide that measured 16 Da more than βT5 (β41-59) was found in tryptic digests derived from the dimeric and monomeric components of fraction 1. Sequencing of this peptide by MS/MS on a triple quadrapole electrospray mass spectrometer (data not shown) narrowed down the position of this modification to the last five amino acid residues (Met55-Lys59). A single methionine residue in β-globin is located within the above sequence (Met55), and thus it's oxidation to methionine sulfoxide seems a likely explanation for the observed increment in peptide (and globin) mass. The purified soluble β-globin chains (CO form) showed a typical absorption spectra characteristic of human hemoglobin (18Di Iorio E.E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 57-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) with peaks at 568, 540, 419, 344, and 276 nm. The ratio of absorbance at 540 nm to that at 276 nm was about 0.3, was consistent among different batches, and was similar to the corresponding value for native, authentic human β-globin. Tetramer assembly in vitro was evaluated for each of the two purified fractions from the Superose 12 column after addition of authentic human native α-globin chain obtained from human red blood cells (Fig. 5). Under these conditions (e.g. 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 at 25°C) authentic, native human β-globin chain very rapidly formed Hb A tetramers (α2β2) in vitro with α-globin (Fig. 5, lane 4). Fraction 2, which contains monomeric β-globin chains, also rapidly formed Hb A tetramers with α-globin chains (Fig. 5, lanes 5 and 6). Formation of tetramers depended on total amount of α- and β-globin chains. If there were an excess of β chains, all of the added α chains were converted with an equivalent amount of β chains to tetramers; in contrast, fraction 1, which contains β-β dimers, was unable to form tetramers in the presence of α chains, even when the same amount of β chain present in fraction 2 was mixed with α chains (Fig. 5A, lane 7). Hb A tetramer formation was not observed on cellulose acetate electrophoresis even after doubling the amount of fraction 1, which was incubated with the α-globin chains (Fig. 5, lane 8). If, however, fraction 1 were first treated with 20 mM DTT for 1 h at 25°C to convert β-β dimers to monomers, then tetrameric Hb A readily formed upon addition of α-globin chains (Fig. 5, lanes 9 and 10). These results indicate that intermolecular disulfide bond formation between two β-globin chains results in β-β dimers, which inhibit assembly with α chains and results in no assembly of tetrameric Hb A. Purified native human β-globin chains from red blood cells can undergo dimerization during storage or under conditions favoring oxidation, and these dimers are also not productive in assembly with α-globin chains. Spontaneous conversion of monomeric β-globin chains prepared from human red blood cells to disulfide-bonded dimers was evident during storage and was promoted by incubation at higher temperatures (Fig. 6A). Dimer formation was observed after 0.5 h incubation at 37°C, and the amounts increased as a function of time. Furthermore, after a 3-h incubation, small amounts (∼10%) of higher molecular mass products (>46 kDa) were also observed. In contrast, addition of catalase during incubation inhibited dimer formation (Fig. 6A). Incubation of monomeric β-globin chains with hydrogen peroxide also promoted dimer formation and the amounts increased with increasing peroxide concentration (Fig. 6B). It is generally known that individual α- or β-globin chains are more unstable than tetrameric Hb A and that α-globin is more unstable than β-globin (19Asakura T. Adachi K. Sono M. Friedman S. Schwartz E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 57: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Friend S.H. Matthew J.B. Gurd F.R.N. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, proper disulfide bond formation during folding generally promotes protein stability (21Baldwin R.L. Eisenberg D. Oxender D.L. Fox C.F. Protein Engineering. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1987: 127Google Scholar, 22Klibanov A.M. Ahern T.J. Oxender D.L. Fox C.F. Protein Engineering. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1987: 213Google Scholar). Thermostability of purified monomeric α- and β-globins as well as dimeric β-globin in the CO forms was measured in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 at 60°C, by monitoring temperature-induced CD changes in ellipticity at 222 nm. CD spectrum for Hb A and α-, β-, and β-β-globin dimers were similar at low temperature (10°C) in the region from 190 to 260 nm (Fig. 7). Changes in ellipticity at 222 nm for Hb A and α-, β-, and β-β-globin dimers as a function of time after temperature jump to 60°C are shown in Fig. 8. Changes in the CD spectra under these experimental conditions follow first-order kinetics. Changes were more dramatic for α-globin than for Hb A tetramers and plateaued after about 1,000 s, suggesting rapid temperature-induced unfolding of α-globin chain. The initial rate of change for β-globin was more than that for Hb A, but much less than that for α-globin, while that for β-β-globin dimers was slightly less than that for unmodified β-globins. Results of thermal denaturation for Hb A, dimeric and monomeric forms of β-globin, as well as α-globin are shown in Table I. The relative ratios standardized to Hb A of the initial rates of change for α:β:β-β:Hb A were 33.5:7.4:6.4:1, respectively. These results indicate that β-β dimerization has little effect on promoting thermal stabilization over that of unmodified β-globins; however, assembly of Hb A tetramers increases stability over that of individual monomeric α- and β-globins. We have established a method to obtain pure, recombinant, soluble, authentic human β-globin chain using an E. coli. expression system. Usually, β-globin chains are isolated in low yield from human tetrameric Hb A and require dissociation of soluble stable tetramers to unstable monomers (11Ikeda-Saito M. Inubushi T. Yonetani T. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This thermodynamically disadvantageous step is accompanied by high amounts of precipitation during purification, resulting in a very low yield of single chains. Hoffman et al. (4Hoffman S.J. Looker D.L. Roehrich J.M. Cozart P.E. Durfee S.L. Tedesco J.L. Stetler G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8521-8525Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) recently developed a bacterial expression system in which human α- and β-globin cDNAs are coexpressed in the same plasmid vector in E. coli. The α- and β-globin chains are folded properly in vivo and assembled into soluble tetrameric Hb A molecules in E. coli. However, expressed chains retained N-terminal methionines. They also attempted to express β-globin cDNA alone under the same conditions and found that the expressed protein was primarily insoluble and that proper folding and heme insertion did not occur. From these results they suggested that heme was not incorporated into β-globin and that interaction between α- and β-globin chains may affect correct folding of the two globin polypeptides in E. coli (4Hoffman S.J. Looker D.L. Roehrich J.M. Cozart P.E. Durfee S.L. Tedesco J.L. Stetler G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8521-8525Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This result is similar to attempts at reconstitution in vitro to form tetrameric Hb A, as described above. It is also noteworthy that our previous attempts were unsuccessful at expressing β-globin chains alone using a yeast expression system (3Adachi K. Konitzer P. Lai C.H. Kim J. Surrey S. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) in which α-globin cDNA was deleted from the expression vector. This yeast system, which was originally developed by Wagenbach et al. (2Wagenbach M. O'Rourke K. Vitez L. Wieczorek A. Hoffman S. Durfee S. Tedesco J. Stetler G. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), produces authentic soluble α- and β-globin chains that assemble in yeast to form soluble tetrameric human hemoglobin without N-terminal methionine (2Wagenbach M. O'Rourke K. Vitez L. Wieczorek A. Hoffman S. Durfee S. Tedesco J. Stetler G. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 3Adachi K. Konitzer P. Lai C.H. Kim J. Surrey S. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The method we now describe to express soluble authentic human β-globin should facilitate production and isolation of single-chain variants in order to further study mechanisms of folding of single chains and assembly. The original pHE2 plasmid was engineered to coexpress α- and β-globin chains in addition to methionine aminopeptidase under control of a taq promoter (6Shen T-J. Ho N.T. Simplaceanu V. Zou M. Green B.N. Tam M.F. Ho C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8108-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 10Ben-Bassat A. Bauer K. Chang S.-Y. Myambo K. Boosman A. Chang S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 751-757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The current expression system uses pHE2β to produce only β-globin and was engineered by deleting α-globin cDNA from the original pHE2 plasmid. This vector system produces significant amounts of soluble β-globin chains that lack N-terminal methionine and contain monomeric and dimeric forms of β-globin. Conditions for expressing β-globin chains alone are the same as those reported previously (6Shen T-J. Ho N.T. Simplaceanu V. Zou M. Green B.N. Tam M.F. Ho C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8108-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Expressed β-globin chains bound heme and spectrophotometric properties were similar to that of authentic β-globin from human red blood cells. These results suggest that conditions in bacteria promote correct folding to produce soluble β-globin chains in the absence of α-globin chain expression. Dimeric as well as monomeric forms of β-globin were obtained using this E. coli expression vector system. Dimers formed from monomers via an intermolecular disulfide bond between cysteine residues, and this bond could be reversed by addition of DTT, even though monomer yield in each experiment was variable. The finding of oxidized dimeric forms implies that cysteine and methionine residues underwent oxidation either in bacteria or during purification. Spontaneous conversion of monomeric β-globin to the disulfide bonded dimer is also readily apparent for native β-globin chains from human red blood cells. Furthermore, some of the purified β-globin chains prepared from human red blood cells upon storage or in the presence of oxidants also showed formation of a doublet dimer band of approximately 32 kDa like recombinant β-globin chains. Human β-globin chain has two cysteine residues (β93 and β112) which could theoretically participate in intermolecular disulfide bond formation. Our tryptic peptide results suggest that Cysβ112 is involved in disulfide bond formation between two β-globin chains, even though other cysteine interactions can not be excluded at this point. It is known that isolated β-globin chains aggregate to form β4 homotetramers, while isolated α-globin chains only form dimers (23Valdes Jr., R. Ackers G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 74-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent x-ray analysis of β4 hemoglobin at 1.8-Å resolution indicated that Cysβ112(G14) is located at the β-chain interface and that the side chains of Cysβ1112 and Cysβ2112 in the β4 tetramer are very close to the molecular dyad at the β1β2 interface (24Borgstahl G.E.O. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 817-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These two residues exist on the surface of the β4 tetramer and may be involved in weak interactions with other residues. In the presence of oxidants, either in vivo or in vitro, these two cysteines could readily form a disulfide bond. Furthermore, it is known that Cysβ112 is located at the interface of α1β1 in hemoglobin tetramers and that this residue also interacts with Valα107 (G14) (24Borgstahl G.E.O. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 817-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These structural observations are consistent with our results and conclusions. Our results show that monomeric β-globin expressed in bacteria assembled in vitro with α-globins as readily as native human β-globin, while dimeric β-globin chains do not form tetramers upon addition in vitro of α chains. The disulfide bond formed between two β-globin chains does not allow dissociation into monomers without reducing agents such as DTT. These results also suggest that β-β dimer formation can be prevented by α-globin chains and that Cysβ112 then can participate in a hydrophobic interaction with Valα107(G14), which facilitates αβ dimer formation and generates stable tetrameric hemoglobin. It is well known that monomeric α- and β-globin chains are not as stable as Hb A. Isolated α- and β-globin chains are also more readily denatured upon mechanical agitation than Hb A tetramers (19Asakura T. Adachi K. Sono M. Friedman S. Schwartz E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 57: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Calculations of electrostatic free energy contributions showed that tetramer formation was more preferable than the monomeric forms (20Friend S.H. Matthew J.B. Gurd F.R.N. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our present thermal stability experiments demonstrate that both α- and β-globin chains are significantly denatured after being exposed to heat at 60°C and that α-globins are less stable than β-globins. The thermal unfolding kinetics of Hb A and its subunits measured by temperature-induced changes in ellipticity at 222 nm in the CD spectra under the present experimental conditions at neutral pH follow first-order kinetics. Acid and alkali denaturation studies of α and β subunits as well as Hb A have been reported previously and show that the denaturation process follows complex first-order kinetics (25Peruts M.F. Nature. 1974; 247: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Franchi D. Fronticelli C. Bucci E. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6181-6187Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The change for the disulfide bonded β-β dimer was slightly less than that of monomeric β-globin chains, indicating that dimers are slightly more stable than monomers. Formation of tetrameric Hb A was, however, most stable to temperature-induced changes in CD spectrum. Monomeric βSH-globin chains can form β4 tetramers that are more stable forms than the monomeric form (23Valdes Jr., R. Ackers G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 74-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Philo J.S. Lary J.W. Schuster T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 682-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, β4 is unstable compared with tetrameric Hb A, even though the quaternary structure of β4 tetramers resembles that of the α2β2 tetramer (24Borgstahl G.E.O. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 817-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These interactions are entropy-droven and involve predominantly hydrophobic interactions. The β4 tetramers readily dissociate into monomeric forms upon addition in vitro of α-globins (28Bunn H.F. McDonald M.J. Nature. 1983; 306: 498-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In contrast, α chain alone can form dimers, which are much more unstable than β-globins. Assembled α2β2 tetramer, however, promotes stability, while β-β dimer, which cannot assemble with α-globin, readily precipitates like β-globin. It would be interesting to know whether dimeric forms exist in red blood cells from patients with various forms of α thalassemia, which result in unbalanced production of α-globin chains (29Schwartz E. Benz Jr., E.J. Hoffman R. Benz Jr., E.J. Shattil S.J. Furie B. Cohen H.J. Hematology. Churchill Livingstone Inc., New York1991: 368Google Scholar). We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2020842540,"We have recently cloned the α subunit of a bovine amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel (αbENaC). This subunit shares extensive homology with both rat and human αENaC subunits but shows marked divergence at the C terminus beginning at amino acid 584 of the 697-residue sequence. When incorporated into planar lipid bilayers, αbENaC almost exclusively exhibits a main transition to 39 picosiemens (pS) with very rare 13 pS step transitions to one of two subconductance states (26 and 13 pS). In contrast, the α subunit of the rat renal homolog of ENaC (αrENaC) has a main transition step to 13 pS that is almost constituitively open, with a second stepwise transition of 26 to 39 pS. A deletion mutant of αbENaC, encompassing the entire C-terminal region (R567X), converts the kinetic behavior of αbENaC to that of αrENaC, i.e. a transition to 13 pS followed by a second 26 pS transition to 39 pS. Chemical cross-linking of R567X restores the wild-type αbENaC gating pattern, whereas treatment with the reducing agent dithiothreitol produced only 13 pS transitions. In contrast, an equivalent C-terminal truncation of αrENaC (R613X) had no effect on the gating pattern of αrENaC. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that interactions between the C termini of αbENaC account for the different kinetic behavior of this member of the ENaC family of Na+ channels.

https://openalex.org/W2077621403,"Incubation of human platelets with EGTA under conditions that dissociate the αIIbβ3-integrin stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72syk (6.8-fold) and of proteins of 62 (2.2-fold), 68 (2.5-fold) and 130 kDa (1.4-fold). Stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72syk was associated with an increase of pp72syk kinase activity. In contrast to pp72syk, tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase pp125FAK was not stimulated by EGTA. Preincubation of platelets with the monoclonal antibody P2, which binds to the αIIbβ3 complex and thus stabilizes it, strongly reduced the increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72syk, p62, and p68 induced by EGTA. The Y2/51 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes only the β3 glycoprotein, did not inhibit the stimulation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation evoked by EGTA. Stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72syk, p62, p68, and p130 induced by EGTA was not observed in thrombasthenic platelets, which lack the αIIbβ3-integrin. The results indicate that the dissociation of the αIIbβ3 complex in intact platelets activates pp72syk. The mechanism of activation was found to be insensitive to inhibition by cAMP and cGMP and only partially dependent on cytosolic Ca2+, suggesting a close functional coupling of αIIbβ3-integrin and pp72syk.

Integrins not only mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, they also trigger intracellular signaling events that lead to changes in cellular function (1Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2822) Google Scholar). In platelets, the major integrin is the αIIbβ3-integrin (glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex). Upon activation of platelets, the αIIbβ3 complex changes its conformation and becomes competent to bind fibrinogen and other adhesive proteins, such as fibronectin and von Willebrand factor (2Siess W. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 58-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). The conformational change of the αIIbβ3-integrin can be induced by physiological stimuli, such as thrombin or ADP, through inside-out signaling (3O'Toole T.E. Mandelman D. Forsyth J. Shattil S.J.

The heterodimer αIIbβ3 complex in resting platelets is also a major Ca2+-binding site, which accounts for >90% of the high affinity Ca2+ binding of the external platelet surface membrane (12Brass L.F. Shattil S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Platelets contain two Ca2+-binding sites per αIIbβ3-integrin. Recent studies have indicated that one Ca2+-binding site is located at the RGD-binding segment of β3 (residues 118-131); the other is probably on the fibrinogen γ-chain binding region of αIIb (residues 294-314) (13D'Souza S.E. Haas T.A. Piotrowicz R.S. Byers-Ward V. McGrath D.E. Soule H.R. Cierniewski C. Plow E.F. Smith J.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The occupancy of these cation-binding sites by Ca2+ is apparently required to maintain the αIIbβ3 complex (14Kunicki T.J. Pidard D. Rosa J.-P. Nurden A.T.

After incubation of platelets with EGTA or EDTA to chelate Ca2+ from the platelet surface membrane, the binding of monoclonal antibodies directed to epitopes of the αIIbβ3 complex (but not to the single αIIb or β3 glycoproteins) is drastically reduced or abolished (17Brass L.F.

It seems, therefore, that chelation of Ca2+ from the high affinity binding sites by EGTA or EDTA leads to the dissociation of the αIIbβ3 complex. These platelets are unable to bind fibrinogen and to aggregate (21Zucker M.B. Grant R.A. Blood. 1978; 52: 505-514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Peerschke E.I. Grant R.A. Zucker M.B. Br. J.

Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2231-2236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A better understanding of the mechanisms of action of EGTA and EDTA on platelets might be of medical relevance, since platelets play a central role in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular diseases (24Siess W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1990; 273: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and chelation therapy, a program of repeated intravenous administration of EDTA, is being used in patients suffering from coronary, peripheral, and cerebral vascular disorders (25Chappell L.T.

Based on previous studies of αIIbβ3-integrin-mediated outside-in signaling, we wondered whether the dissociation of the αIIbβ3 complex might also be sensed by the cell interior. It is possible that the cytoplasmic domains of αIIbβ3 bind, directly or indirectly, signal transduction proteins, such as specific tyrosine kinases and phosphatases. In fact, β1- and β3-integrins have been suggested to associate directly with the focal adhesion kinase pp125FAK (27Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Curr. Biol. 1994; 6: 705-710Crossref Scopus (495) Google Scholar), and an αIIbβ3-integrin-mediated activation of pp125FAK has been reported in several studies (28Lipfert L. Haimovich B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28859-28864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that the dissociation of the αIIbβ3-integrin might affect the activity of these kinases. We observed in the present study that the dissociation of the αIIbβ3-integrin is associated with a profound stimulation of the tyrosine kinase pp72syk but not the focal adhesion kinase pp125FAK and is paralleled by a distinct increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of 62-, 68-, and 130-kDa proteins in intact platelets. Remarkably, the profound activation of pp72syk, induced by dissociation of the integrin, did not cause any sign of physiological platelet activation. The monoclonal antibody 4G10 (directed against phosphotyrosine) and the monoclonal antibody directed against pp125FAK (free and covalently bound to protein A-agarose) were from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). The monoclonal antibody PY20 (directed against phosphotyrosine) and the affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal IgG (directed against pp72syk) (free or as agarose conjugate) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Control rabbit IgG covalently bound to agarose was from Sigma. The monoclonal antibody P2 (directed against the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex) was from Immunotech (Hamburg, Germany); the monoclonal antibody Y2/51 (directed against glycoprotein IIIa) was from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark). EGTA and EDTA (both at a purity of >99%) were from Calbiochem (Frankfurt, Germany). All other materials were obtained as reported previously (37Negrescu E.V. de Quintana K.L. Siess W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1057-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Human platelets were treated with acetylsalicylic acid and isolated as described (37Negrescu E.V. de Quintana K.L. Siess W. J. Biol.

The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,600 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant (1.2 ml) was incubated with agarose conjugates of 8 μg anti-pp72syk-IgG2α and subsequently of 20 μg anti-pp125FAK-IgG1 at 4°C for 2 or 12 h. The immunoprecipitate was pelleted by centrifugation (15,600 × g for 10 min at 4°C) and washed three times with ice-cold RIPA buffer (1 ml), once with 10 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl (pH 8.0), and once with HEPES 10 mM (pH 8.0). Immunoprecipitates were incubated for 3 min at 95°C in 100 μl of sample buffer. For kinase assays, pp72syk immunoprecipitates were incubated with 50 μl of kinase assay buffer (100 mM HEPES, pH 8, 0.1 μM ATP, 0.01 mM sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM Mg acetate, and 150 mM NaCl) for 2 or 10 min at 25°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 2× sample buffer containing 30 mM EDTA and incubation for 3 min at 95°C. Tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72syk was measured by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot. Proteins from platelet suspensions or immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8%) (Bio-Rad). Proteins were blotted and detected as described (37Negrescu E.V. de Quintana K.L. Siess W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1057-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The dilutions of the mixed primary phosphotyrosine antibodies PY20 and 4G021 were both 1:2000; the dilutions of the monoclonal anti-pp125FAK and the polyclonal anti-pp72syk antibodies were 1:2000 and 1:1000, respectively. The dilutions of the horseradish-peroxidase-linked secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were 1:15,000 and 1:2500, respectively. Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots of pp72syk and pp125FAK immunoprecipitates were stripped by incubating the nitrocellulose membrane in buffer (2% SDS, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, and 100 mM mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8) for 30 min at 70°C and reprobed with specific antibodies to quantify the amount of kinases immunoprecipitated. Immunoblotted protein bands were measured by densitometry (Sharp JX 325 and Ultroscan XL, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Absorption of proteins in unstimulated control samples was set to 100%. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. of individual experiments from different blood donors. Immunoblots shown are representative of 3-7 trials. Addition of EGTA (2 mM) to a prewarmed (37°C) stirred suspension of washed platelets did not evoke platelet shape change. There was also no sign of platelet activation when platelets were incubated up to 30 min with EGTA (Fig. 1). The subsequent addition of the partial thrombin receptor agonist YFLLRNP lead to a decrease of light transmission and disappearance of oscillations, both of which are indicative of platelet shape change (37Negrescu E.V. de Quintana K.L. Siess W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1057-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast to EGTA, the addition of EDTA (5 mM) resulted in platelet shape change confirming previous studies (20Gachet C. Hanau D. Spehner D. Brisson C. Garaud J.-C. Schmitt D.A. Ohlmann P.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of the proteins p62, p68, and p130 was increased after platelet incubation with EGTA, EGTA plus YFLLRNP, or EDTA (Fig. 2). EGTA (2 mM for 20 min at 37°C) increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of p62 by 226 ± 56, of p68 by 252 ± 55, and of p130 by 144 ± 18% of control (means ± S.D., n = 20). Shape change induced by YFLLRNP, EDTA, or EDTA plus YFLLRNP was associated with a further increase of protein tyrosine phosphorylation of p62, p68, and p130 (Fig. 2, lanes 5, 7, and 8).Fig. 2Comparison of tyrosine phosphorylation of p62, p68, and p130 induced by EGTA, EGTA plus YFLLRNP, EDTA, and EDTA plus YFLLRNP.

A low cytosolic Ca2+ caused by BAPTA-AM (but not by EGTA) inhibits protein tyrosine kinases shifting the balance toward protein tyrosine dephosphorylation (37Negrescu E.V. de Quintana K.L. Siess W.

Addition of YFLLRNP to BAPTA-AM-pretreated platelets still induced an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins (Fig. 2, lanes 9 and 10). In contrast, the stimulatory effect of EGTA on protein tyrosine phosphorylation was almost completely abolished by the simultaneous incubation with BAPTA-AM (compare lanes 9 and 11). Platelets contain several protein tyrosine kinases (8Clark E.A. Shattil S.J. Brugge J.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 464-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), which might be stimulated by EGTA. Since an αIIbβ3-integrin-mediated activation of pp72syk and pp125FAK has been reported previously (28Lipfert L. Haimovich B. Schaller M.D. Cobb B.S. Parsons J.T. J.

Platelet lysates were incubated with a specific pp72syk antibody covalently bound to agarose to immunoprecipitate pp72syk. Estimations using anti-pp72syk immunoblotting indicated that 20% of total platelet syk was immunoprecipitated. We observed that the electrophoretic mobility of pp72syk was different and, notably, higher than the mobility of the tyrosine-phosphorylated p68 in 8% polyacrylamide gels (data not shown). Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots of the pp72syk immunoprecipitates showed an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72syk after platelet incubation with EGTA (Figs. 3A and 4). Tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72syk increased 6.8 ± 3.8-fold (mean ± S.D.; n = 20).Fig. 4The stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72syk, p62, p68, and p130 by EGTA is dependent on the incubation time. Suspensions of washed platelets were incubated for various times with 2 mM EGTA at 37°C. Tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72syk was measured after immunoprecipitation of platelet lysates with anti-pp72syk IgG agarose, and tyrosine phosphorylation of p62, p68, and p130 was measured after transferring aliquots of platelet suspensions to sample buffer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Previous studies have found that Ca2+-dependent αIIbβ3 complexes are present on resting platelets and that these complexes can be dissociated by prolonged treatment of platelets with EDTA or EGTA at 37°C but not at room temperature (14Kunicki T.J.

We found that the increase of protein tyrosine phosphorylation of p62, p68, p130, and pp72syk evoked by EGTA and EDTA was temperature dependent. The stimulation was only observed when platelets were incubated with EGTA or EDTA at 37°C and furthermore found when platelets were incubated in the absence of continuous stirring (Fig. 3). Tyrosine phosphorylation did not increase when platelets were incubated with EGTA or EDTA at room temperature (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 6; Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). The stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72syk, p62, p68, and p130 showed similar concentration-response-curves (Fig. 3) and was dependent on the time of incubation. No increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72syk, p62, p68, and p130 was observed when platelets were incubated with EGTA for 5 min. Tyrosine phosphorylation increased subsequently and reached maximal levels between 20 and 40 min of platelet incubation with EGTA (Fig. 4). The increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72syk was more pronounced than the increase of the other proteins. EGTA did not increase tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase pp125FAK, indicating that in contrast to pp72syk, this tyrosine kinase was not activated by EGTA. Tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK was, however, dramatically increased after platelet aggregation with thrombin (1 unit/ml) for 30 s (Fig. 5) as observed previously (28Lipfert L. Haimovich B. Schaller M.D. Cobb B.S. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 29Huang M.-M. Lipfert L. Cunningham M. Brugge J.S. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. J.

It was observed in previous studies that the stability of the αIIbβ3 complex in intact platelets and platelet membranes at extracellular Ca2+-concentrations <10−9M is also pH dependent (16Gogstad G.O. Hagen I. Krutnes M.B. Solum N.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 689: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 17Brass L.F. Shattil S.J. Kunicki T.J. Bennett J.S. J. Biol.

Solum N.O. Blood. 1982; 60: 663-671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of a complex-specific monoclonal antibody to intact platelets suspended at 25°C in EGTA buffer declined above pH 8.0 (17Brass L.F. Shattil S.J. Kunicki T.J. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7875-7881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, in the present study it was found that the effect of EGTA on platelet protein tyrosine phosphorylation was more pronounced at alkaline pH. When platelets were incubated in the presence of EGTA (2 mM) at 21°C in buffers with pH values ranging from 6.5 to 8.5, stimulation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation was only observed at alkaline pH (>8.0); at pH 8.5 it was 158, 307, 182, and 458% of control for p62, p68, p130, and pp72syk, respectively. Stimulation of pp72syk tyrosine phosphorylation was also higher when platelets were incubated at 37°C with EGTA at pH 8.5 than at pH 6.5 (data not shown). All of these data indicate that EGTA-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72syk, p62, p68, and p130 under conditions known to dissociate the αIIbβ3-integrin. The effect of EGTA was dependent on the incubation time, temperature, and extracellular pH. Previous studies have shown that the enzymatic activity of pp72syk is increased by autophosphorylation on tyrosine (32Taniguchi T. Kitagawa H. Yasue S. Yanagi S. Sakai K. Asahi M. Ohta S. Takeuchi F.

To find out whether EGTA stimulated the enzymatic activity of pp72syk in intact platelets, immunoprecipitation kinase assays were carried out. Anti-pp72syk immunoprecipitates were incubated in kinase buffer with ATP for 2 and 10 min, and autophosphorylation of pp72syk was measured by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot. As shown in Fig. 6, EGTA treatment of platelets stimulated the kinase activity of pp72syk. The stimulation was almost as pronounced as after platelet stimulation with thrombin. Autophosphorylation of pp72syk in immunoprecipitation kinase assays increased 2.4 ± 0.8-fold after treatment with EGTA (2 mM for 20 min) and 3 ± 0.45-fold after treatment with thrombin (1 unit/ml for 10 s; mean ± S.D.; n = 6). To further explore whether the effect of EGTA on tyrosine phosphorylation and pp72syk activation was mediated by the dissociation of the αIIbβ3-integrin, platelets were incubated with P2, a monoclonal antibody that binds to the αIIbβ3 complex (44McGregor J.L. McGregor L. Bauer A.-S. Catimel B. Brochier J. Dechavanne M. Clemetson K.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 159: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and Y2/51, a monoclonal antibody that binds to the β3 glycoprotein only. As shown in Fig. 7, P2 but not Y2/51 inhibited the increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72syk, p62, p68, and p130 in platelets incubated with EGTA. Previous studies have shown that complex-specific antibodies such as P2 inhibit the dissociation of the αIIbβ3-integrin evoked by EGTA or EDTA treatment of platelets (20Gachet C. Hanau D. Spehner D.

The antibodies probably stabilize the αIIbβ3 complex and/or hinder the access of EGTA toward the Ca2+-binding sites of the αIIbβ3 complex. Thrombasthenic platelets lack the αIIbβ3 glycoproteins. Consequently, incubation of thrombasthenic platelets with EGTA did not lead to the stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72syk, p62, p68, and p130 (Fig. 8). Collectively, these data indicate that the glycoproteins IIb/IIIa mediate the effect of EGTA on the stimulation of pp72syk kinase and tyrosine phosphorylation of p62, p68, and p130 and that the dissociation of the αIIbβ3 complex by EGTA is the underlying mechanism.Fig. 8EGTA does not stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72syk, p62, p68, and p130 in thrombasthenic platelets. Suspensions of washed control platelets (lanes 1 and 2) or thrombasthenic platelets (lanes 3 and 4) were incubated as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Studies on the regulation of stimulation of pp72syk, p62, p68, and p130 tyrosine phosphorylation induced by EGTA indicated that the stimulation of pp72syk tyrosine phosphorylation was quite insensitive against various inhibitors (the cAMP- and cGMP-increasing drugs iloprost and SIN-1, respectively, and the cytosolic Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM), whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of p62, p68, and p130 was strongly reduced and often was lower than in control platelets. Preincubation (2 min) of platelets with iloprost (100 nM) or SIN-1 (500 μM), which increased the levels of platelet cAMP and cGMP, respectively, did not affect the stimulation of pp72syk tyrosine phosphorylation evoked by EGTA (5 mM for 20 min), but it reduced pp72syk tyrosine phosphorylation stimulated by thrombin (0.1 units for 10 s); however, the stimulation of p62, p68, and p130 evoked by EGTA was reduced to control levels by iloprost and SIN-1 (data not shown). The incubation of platelets with BAPTA-AM inhibited only slightly the increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72syk but suppressed the stimulation of p62, p68, and p130 tyrosine phosphorylation evoked by EGTA. Incubation of platelets with BAPTA-AM (20 μM) for 20 min reduced the EGTA (2 mM)-induced stimulation of pp72syk tyrosine phosphorylation from 5.7 ± 2.5 to 4.3 ± 3.7-fold but strongly suppressed the EGTA-induced stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of p62, p68, and p130 from 2.0 ± 0.3 to 0.3 ± 0.2, 3.0 ± 0.4 to 0.5 ± 0.4, and 1.5 ± 0.2 to 0.4 ± 0.1-fold, respectively (mean ± S.D.; n = 3-5; see also Figs. 2, lanes 4 and 11, and 7, lanes 2 and 4). These data indicate that the activation of pp72syk induced by EGTA-mediated dissociation of the αIIbβ3 complex is quite independent of cytosolic Ca2+, and moreover is insensitive to inhibition by cAMP or cGMP, suggesting a close coupling of αIIbβ3-integrin and pp72syk. The present study indicates that the dissociation of the αIIbβ3-integrin by EGTA induces activation of the tyrosine kinase pp72syk but not pp125FAK. Activation of pp72syk was accompanied by an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of p62, p68, and p130. It was surprising to find that the profound activation of pp72syk induced by EGTA did not lead to a physiological platelet response. Previously, a rapid and transient activation of pp72syk has been observed after platelet stimulation by a wide range of platelet stimuli, suggesting a role of pp72syk in early platelet signal transduction (32Taniguchi T.

The concomitant stimulation of other signal transduction pathways (46Hartwig J.H. Bokoch G.M. Carpenter C.L. Janmey P.A. Taylor L.A. Toker A. Stossel T.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) might be necessary which leads to the increase of actin polymerization and reorganization of the actin-rich cytoskeleton during shape change. These cytoskeletal changes are not found after treatment with EGTA (data not shown). Previously, we found that shape change induced by the partial thrombin receptor agonist YFLLRNP was associated with an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of p62, p68, and p130 (37Negrescu E.V. de Quintana K.L. Siess W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1057-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although the degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of p68 and p130 induced by EGTA was less than after stimuli (YFLLRNP and EDTA) that induced shape change, the increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72syk was more pronounced after EGTA treatment. It is not known but it is possible that p62, p68, and p130 are substrates of pp72syk in intact platelets. The discrepancy of a higher degree of pp72syk activation and less tyrosine phosphorylation of p68 and p130 after treatment with EGTA as compared to YFLLRNP might be explained either by activation of further tyrosine kinases or translocation of pp72syk to the cytoskeleton during platelet shape change. In that location, active pp72syk might more efficiently phosphorylate the putative polypeptide substrates p62, p68, and p130, which are present in the cytoskeleton (37Negrescu E.V. de Quintana K.L. Siess W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1057-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The activation of pp72syk and the increase of protein tyrosine phosphorylation induced by EGTA were mediated by the αIIbβ3. (a) It was not observed in thrombasthenic platelets, which lack the αIIbβ3-integrin. (b) It was only found under incubation conditions (time, temperature, and pH) that dissociate the αIIbβ3-integrin (14Kunicki T.J. Pidard D. Rosa J.-P. Nurden A.T.

There are some similarities between Ca2+ chelators and fibrinogen-receptor ligands concerning the effect on the αIIbβ3-integrin. Both binding of ligands such as RGD-peptides to the receptor and chelation of cations from the receptor in the absence of ligand expose ligand-induced binding sites epitopes (7Frelinger III, A.L. Du X. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17106-17111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Ginsberg M.H. Lightsey A.L. Kunicki T.J. Kaufman A. Marguerie G.A. Plow E.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1103-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The αIIbβ3-integrin has two Ca2+-binding sites: one presumably at the EF-hand Ca2+-binding motif of αIIb (residues 296-306), the other at β3 (residues 118-131) (13D'Souza S.E. Haas T.A. Piotrowicz R.S. Byers-Ward V. McGrath D.E. Soule H.R. Cierniewski C. Plow E.F. Smith J.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Interestingly, not only Ca2+ chelators but also ligand binding to the αIIbβ3-integrin apparently removes these cations. It has been demonstrated that RGD-containing ligands bound to the same cation-binding segment of β3 (residues 118-131); this binding was followed by displacement of the cation (13D'Souza S.E. Haas T.A. Piotrowicz R.S. Byers-Ward V. McGrath D.E. Soule H.R. Cierniewski C. Plow E.F. Smith J.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). RGDS, in our study, did not stimulate pp72syk kinase and protein tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). We conclude that the RGD-ligand-induced displacement of cations and the associated conformational change of the αIIbβ3-integrin is not sufficient to activate pp72syk. Either a dissociation of the αIIbβ3-integrin (as induced by EGTA) or a second signal, such as a further conformational change of the complex (as induced by fibrinogen binding), is required. It has been demonstrated that the N-terminal noncatalytic domain of pp125FAK can bind directly to the cytoplasmic tail of the β1-integrin in vitro (48Schaller M.D. Otey C.A. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). It is not known whether pp125FAK is bound to the β3-integrin in intact platelets. Our results show that dissociation of the αIIbβ3-integrin did not cause activation of pp125FAK, which has been functionally linked to the formation of focal adhesions (27Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Curr. Biol. 1994; 6: 705-710Crossref Scopus (495) Google Scholar). It is remarkable that the stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72syk evoked by EGTA was quite insensitive to inhibition by various drugs, namely the cytosolic Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM and the cAMP- and cGMP-elevating drugs iloprost and SIN-1, respectively. All of these substances, however, efficiently reduced the increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of p62, p68, and p130 induced by EGTA. It seems, therefore, that the αIIbβ3-integrin and pp72syk are, functionally, closely coupled in intact platelets: the interaction of the αIIbβ3-integrin with pp72syk is not accessible to these drugs, in contrast to the phosphorylation of the putative polypeptide substrates by the active pp72syk. How is pp72syk activated by αIIbβ3-integrin dissociation? Two models can be considered. (a) The dissociation of the complex enables the now free cytoplasmic domains of αIIb or β3 to interact indirectly or directly with pp72syk, thereby activating the enzyme. (B) The αIIbβ3 complex in resting platelets might be bound to an active protein tyrosine phosphatase, which dephosphorylates pp72syk, thereby inhibiting its enzymatic activity. Dissociation of the complex leads to the loss of active protein tyrosine phosphatase and, hence, to an increase of pp72syk tyrosine phosphorylation and activity. Collectively, we have observed in the present study that the dissociation of the αIIbβ3-integrin was associated with a profound stimulation of the tyrosine kinase pp72syk but not the focal adhesion kinase pp125FAK and was paralleled by a distinct increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of p62, p68, and p130 in intact platelets. Remarkably, the profound activation of pp72syk induced by αIIbβ3-integrin dissociation did not cause any sign of physiological platelet activation. We thank U.

In spite of about 30% of sequence similarity to troponin C and CaM, CaVP does not substitute for the latter proteins in functional assays and bona fide CaM and troponin C are present in Amphioxus (30Takagi T.

Moreover, the only known endogenous target of CaVP is CaVPT, a unique 26-kDa protein displaying the following domain structure: 1) segment 1-23, a Pro-Ala-Lys-rich repetitive motif at the N terminus; 2) segment 36-50 displaying sequence similarity to CaM-binding sites in neuromodulin and neurogranin (Alexander et al., 1988; 3Apel E.D.

EMBO J. 1990; 11: 1711-1716Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar et al., 1990), proteins believed to be involved in homotypic interactions as well as in the interaction with myosin. At present the role of CaVPT is not well established, although recent data indicate that it interacts with a paramyosin-like protein and thus may participate in regulation of thick filament dynamics (26Petrova T.V. Comte M. Takagi T. Cox J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar et al., 1995b).Our previous study indicated that while the complex CaVP-CaVPT possesses a rather rigid structure and does not display pronounced interactive properties, CaVP and CaVPT have characteristics of highly dynamic proteins (27Petrova T.V. Comte M. Takagi T. Cox J.A. Ninth International Symposium on Calcium-binding Proteins and Calcium functions in Health and Disease. Airlie, VAApril 29 to May 3,1995Google Scholar et al., 1995a). This allowed us to hypothesize that the complex represents a non-interactive end product and that CaVPT itself is the relay protein toward the unknown cellular response element. Under physiological conditions the affinity of CaVP for CaVPT is 80-fold higher in the presence of Ca2+, but Ca2+ removal does not lead to dissociation. In search of a physiological mechanism of CaVP-CaVPT dissociation we have studied the effect of phosphorylation by PKA and PKC on the interactive properties of CaVPT, in analogy with the dissociation mechanism proposed for neuromodulin/neurogranin and CaM (Apel et al., 1990; Baudier et al., 1991). We have also investigated by means of controlled proteolysis the domain structure of CaVPT and the interactive properties of the individual domains. Finally, we studied the interaction of CaVP with a synthetic peptide IQ comprising the IQ domain of CaVPT, in order to evaluate whether this sequence represents the CaVP-binding site, as it was suggested earlier (29Takagi T. Cox J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19721-19727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Cox, 1991).DISCUSSIONThe Ig-fold is a common structural motif found in many intracellular muscle proteins, such as the giant protein titin (20Labeit S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 3670-3676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar et al., 1993) etc. It is composed of about 100 amino acids that form a β-barrel consisting of 8 β strands (17Holden H.M. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. Rayment I. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 840-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar et al., 1992; 25Pfuhl M. Gautel M. Politou A.S. Joseph C. Pastore A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar et al., 1995). Although the number of Ig-folds per protein varies from 112 copies in titin (Labeit and Kolmerer, 1995) to only 1 in the gizzard smooth muscle component telokin (Ito et al., 1989), all intracellular Ig-fold containing proteins are thought to be implicated in the regulation of myosin activity and assembly of thick filaments. CaVPT from muscle of Amphioxus is one of the smallest members of this family: it contains only two Ig-folds that account for 80% of its sequence (Fig. 9a). Residues 36-50 preceding the Ig-folds, display a high degree of sequence similarity to the CaM-binding domains of neuromodulin and neurogranin (Fig. 9b), as it was pointed by 8Cheney R.E. Espreafico E.M. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115 (abstr.): 432Google Scholar et al. (1991). Takagi and Cox (1991) have demonstrated that CaVPT can bind to CaM but in vivo it rather forms a strong complex with CaVP, a particular Ca2+-binding protein of the EF-hand superfamily. Until now CaVPT represents a unique example where an intracellular Ig-fold protein is associated with a Ca2+-binding component.Neuromodulin and neurogranin constitute a separate group within the family of CaM-binding proteins due to their ability to fix CaM with almost equal and relatively low affinity in the absence as in the presence of Ca2+ (1Alexander K.A. Cimler B.M. Meier K.E. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6108-6113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar et al., 1987; Baudier et al., 1991). The regulation of their interaction with CaM is achieved through the phosphorylation by PKC of a serine residue in the CaM-binding domain, referred to as the IQ domain (Apel et al., 1990; Baudier et al, 1991). Similar IQ motifs, often in numerous copies, have also been identified in many unconventional myosins where they serve to anchor CaM (13Espreafico E.M. Cheney R.E. Matteoli M. Nascimento A. De Camilli P.V. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 6: 1541-1557Crossref Scopus (306) Google Scholar et al., 1992; reviewed by 36Wolenski J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 310-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar (1995)). Recently, it was shown that the ATPase activity of p68 RNA helicase, the protein possessing one IQ motif, is modulated by phosphorylation and calmodulin binding (7Buelt M.K. Glidden B.J. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29367-29370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar et al., 1994). In this study we have investigated how the interaction of CaVP and CaVPT is regulated by phosphorylation of the IQ domain and which of the individual domains of CaVPT contribute to the formation of the CaVP-binding site.Phosphorylation of CaVPTOf four potential phosphorylation sites for PKC in CaVPT, namely Ser-43, Ser-145, Thr-164, and Thr-239, only Ser-43 situated in the IQ domain can be phosphorylated in vitro. The phosphorylation of Ser-43 drastically decreases the affinity of CaVPT for CaVP and a 3-fold excess of CaVP protects CaVPT from phosphorylation. These data underline the universality of the IQ domain as a module for the PKC-regulated interaction with Ca2+-binding proteins in otherwise very different protein systems. The biological consequence of this phosphorylation likely varies from one protein to another as they show very little sequence homology except for the IQ domain. It was proposed that the phosphorylation of neuromodulin and neurogranin leads to an increase of the “local” concentration of CaM and to the activation of CaM-regulated processes (Alexander et al., 1987). However, in the case of the CaVP/CaVPT system, we rather suggest that the phosphorylation is necessary to maintain CaVPT in its free state. Indeed, free CaVPT but not the complex was found to interact with the 106-kDa protein from Amphioxus muscle (Petrova et al., 1995b).With PROSITE, a dictionary of post-translational modification sites (Geneva University Hospital and University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland), no consensus sequence for PKA can be detected in CaVPT. It is known, however, that many well established substrates of PKA do not possess a canonical phosphorylation site RRxS (34Walsh D.A. Van Patten S.M. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1227-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar and Van Patten, 1994). Our data clearly show that CaVPT can be phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of PKA at multiple sites, including Ser-43, and that the phosphorylation is prevented by CaVP. Moreover, these results provide an interesting example of allosteric propagation of a conformational change in CaVPT induced by CaVP: four out of the five phosphorylation sites are located in the second Ig-fold (Fig. 9a), i.e. far away from the suggested CaVP-binding site, yet in the complex CaVP-CaVPT these sites cannot be phosphorylated. Likewise we previously observed a strong decrease in the reactivity of two thiols located in the second Ig-fold of CaVPT upon formation of the complex with CaVP (Petrova et al., 1995a). We suggest, therefore, that the binding of CaVP provokes an allosteric re-arrangement in the structure of CaVPT which propagates from the N to the C terminus of the protein. Interestingly, a similar model of ligand-induced conformational changes may be proposed for C-CAM1, an epithelial cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Binding of CaM to the cytoplasmic domain of C-CAM1, situated at the C terminus of the molecule, causes a down-regulation of the homophilic self-association of C-CAM1 which is thought to mediate cell-cell adhesion (12Edlund M. Blikstad I. Öbrink B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1393-1399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar et al., 1996).Domain Structure of CaVPT and CaVP-binding SiteThe phosphorylation of Ser-43 within the IQ motif is prevented by CaVP suggesting that the phosphorylation occurs in the CaVP-binding domain. Moreover, the phosphorylation of Ser-43 efficiently inhibits the interaction between CaVPT and CaVP. The question arises whether the IQ domain alone represents an entire CaVP-binding site. The synthetic IQ peptide, which comprises residues 36-50 of CaVPT, revealed to be a good target for CaM but, surprisingly, interacted only weakly with CaVP. In the case of the entire protein the situation is inverse: the affinity of CaVP for intact CaVPT exceeds significantly that of CaM (Cox, 1986). This apparent contradiction can be resolved by the assumption that the fully potential CaVP-binding site includes an additional region(s) of CaVPT. A parallel can be drawn with the γ-subunit of phosphorylase kinase, where the CaM-binding site is composed of two noncontiguous subdomains (10Dasgupta M. Honeycutt T. Blumenthal D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17156-17163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar et al., 1989). The binding properties of the proteolytic fragments point to the importance of the region 1-50 of CaVPT, including, in addition to the IQ domain, the Pro-Ala-Lys-rich region (Fig. 9a). Pro-rich domains were found to play a significant role in protein-protein interactions (reviewed by 35Williamson M.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar (1994)). In further studies concerning the exact boundaries of the CaVP-binding site, our working hypothesis is that both the Pro-Ala-Lys-rich domain and the IQ motif participate in its formation.

This allowed us to hypothesize that the complex represents a non-interactive end product and that CaVPT itself is the relay protein toward the unknown cellular response element. Under physiological conditions the affinity of CaVP for CaVPT is 80-fold higher in the presence of Ca2+, but Ca2+ removal does not lead to dissociation. In search of a physiological mechanism of CaVP-CaVPT dissociation we have studied the effect of phosphorylation by PKA and PKC on the interactive properties of CaVPT, in analogy with the dissociation mechanism proposed for neuromodulin/neurogranin and CaM (Apel et al., 1990; Baudier et al., 1991). We have also investigated by means of controlled proteolysis the domain structure of CaVPT and the interactive properties of the individual domains. Finally, we studied the interaction of CaVP with a synthetic peptide IQ comprising the IQ domain of CaVPT, in order to evaluate whether this sequence represents the CaVP-binding site, as it was suggested earlier (29Takagi T.

DISCUSSIONThe Ig-fold is a common structural motif found in many intracellular muscle proteins, such as the giant protein titin (20Labeit S. Kolmerer B. Science. 1995; 270: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar and Kolmerer, 1995), myosin light chain kinase (Olson et al., 1990), C-protein (Fürst et al., 1992), M-protein (22Noguchi J.

Hartshorne D.J. Rayment I. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 840-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar et al., 1992; 25Pfuhl M. Gautel M. Politou A.S. Joseph C. Pastore A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar et al., 1995). Although the number of Ig-folds per protein varies from 112 copies in titin (Labeit and Kolmerer, 1995) to only 1 in the gizzard smooth muscle component telokin (Ito et al., 1989), all intracellular Ig-fold containing proteins are thought to be implicated in the regulation of myosin activity and assembly of thick filaments. CaVPT from muscle of Amphioxus is one of the smallest members of this family: it contains only two Ig-folds that account for 80% of its sequence (Fig. 9a). Residues 36-50 preceding the Ig-folds, display a high degree of sequence similarity to the CaM-binding domains of neuromodulin and neurogranin (Fig. 9b), as it was pointed by 8Cheney R.E. Espreafico E.M. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115 (abstr.): 432Google Scholar et al. (1991). Takagi and Cox (1991) have demonstrated that CaVPT can bind to CaM but in vivo it rather forms a strong complex with CaVP, a particular Ca2+-binding protein of the EF-hand superfamily. Until now CaVPT represents a unique example where an intracellular Ig-fold protein is associated with a Ca2+-binding component.Neuromodulin and neurogranin constitute a separate group within the family of CaM-binding proteins due to their ability to fix CaM with almost equal and relatively low affinity in the absence as in the presence of Ca2+ (1Alexander K.A. Cimler B.M. Meier K.E. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6108-6113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar et al., 1987; Baudier et al., 1991). The regulation of their interaction with CaM is achieved through the phosphorylation by PKC of a serine residue in the CaM-binding domain, referred to as the IQ domain (Apel et al., 1990; Baudier et al, 1991). Similar IQ motifs, often in numerous copies, have also been identified in many unconventional myosins where they serve to anchor CaM (13Espreafico E.M. Cheney R.E. Matteoli M. Nascimento A. De Camilli P.V. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 6: 1541-1557Crossref Scopus (306) Google Scholar et al., 1992; reviewed by 36Wolenski J.S.

Recently, it was shown that the ATPase activity of p68 RNA helicase, the protein possessing one IQ motif, is modulated by phosphorylation and calmodulin binding (7"

Seven different mutant alleles were identified. In one case the mutation occurs in the mitochondrial targeting sequence (M1I). The remaining six mutations map to the mature part of the β subunit protein and alter amino acids that are conserved in the bovine heart mitochondrial and Escherichia coli β subunit proteins. Biochemical analysis of the yeast atp2 mutants identified two different phenotypes. The G133D, P179L, and G227D mutations correlate with an assembly-defective phenotype that is characterized by the accumulation of the F1α and β subunits in large protein aggregates. Strains harboring the A192V, E222K, or R293K mutations assemble an F1 of normal size that is none-the-less catalytically inactive. The effect of the atp2 mutations was also analyzed in diploids formed by crossing the mutants to wild type yeast. Hybrid enzymes formed with β subunits containing either the G133D, E222K, or R293K mutations are compromised for steady-state ATPase activity. The display of partial dominance confirms the importance of Gly133 for structural stability and of Glu222 and Arg293 for catalytic cooperativity.

The F1-F0 ATP synthase (ATPase) of mitochondrial, chloroplast, and bacterial membranes catalyzes ATP synthesis coupled to respiration (1Penefsky H.S. Cross R.L. Adv. Enzymol. 1991; 64: 173-214PubMed Google Scholar, 2Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). The enzyme is composed of a catalytic moiety, F1, attached peripherally to an integral membrane component, F0. Three types of subunits (designated a, b, and c in bacteria (3Futai M. Kanazawa H. Microbiol. Rev. 1983; 47: 285-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Walker J.E. Saraste M. Gay N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 164-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar)) constitute an evolutionarily conserved core F0 structure, and there is variation among species as to whether or not additional F0 subunits are present (5Collinson I.R. Runswick M.J. Buchanan S.K. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. vaan Raaij M.J. Griffiths D.E. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7971-7978Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). F1 shows a remarkable degree of structural conservation, and in most organisms studied, exists as an oligomer of five different subunits with the stoichiometry α3β3γδε (1Penefsky H.S. Cross R.L. Adv. Enzymol. 1991; 64: 173-214PubMed Google Scholar, 2Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of bovine mitochondrial F1 shows the α and β subunits alternating in a hexagonal ring, with the amino and carboxyl termini of the γ subunit located in the central core of the ring (6Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar). Six adenine nucleotide binding sites are located at the α/β interfaces. Three of these sites are catalytic and reside primarily in the β subunit; the other three sites are noncatalytic and are contributed mostly by residues of the α subunits (6Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar). The three catalytic sites interact cooperatively during enzyme turnover; this process is probably mediated by conformational changes in the F1 subunits (1Penefsky H.S. Cross R.L. Adv. Enzymol. 1991; 64: 173-214PubMed Google Scholar, 2Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). A principal focus in F1 research is to understand the mechanistic details that underlie catalytic cooperativity. The study of mutants with defects in the F1 subunits offers a means to test the catalytic function of amino acids and to identify the residues that propagate conformational changes in the enzyme. Several excellent reviews are available that document studies performed with Escherichia coli mutants to probe the structure/function relationships in F1 (7Futai M. Noumi T. Maeda M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1988; 20: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 8Futai M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 9Senior A.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 19: 7-41Crossref Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is equally amenable to genetic manipulation. Moreover, the analysis of yeast F1 mutants is of particular value now that an atomic structure of the mitochondrial enzyme is available (6Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar). Genetic studies with yeast F1 have centered on the β subunit, which is coded for by the ATP2 gene (10Takeda M. Vassarotti A. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15458-15465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in chromosome X (11Takeda M. Okushiba T. Hayashida T. Gunge N. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1531-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The work reported to date has used site-directed mutagenesis to effect changes in amino acids that were previously shown to react with chemical labels (12Mueller D.M. J. Biol.

The present study constitutes the first report in which mutations induced chemically in the yeast β subunit gene were characterized both biochemically and genetically. Two classes of β subunit mutations were identified: those that alter catalysis without affecting the enzyme structure and those that produce defects in F1 assembly. The genotypes and sources of the mutant and wild type yeast strains used in the present study are listed in Table I. Chemically induced mutants were obtained as described (17Tzagoloff A.

(18Faye G. Kujawa C. Fukuhara H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 185-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) was used to prepare mitochondria with the exception that zymolyase, instead of Glusulase, was used to digest the cell wall. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to 10 μg/ml final concentration during the cell-breaking step to minimize proteolysis. Mitochondria were suspended at 6.6 mg/ml in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 4 mM ATP (TEA buffer) and incubated for 15 min with 0.25% Triton X-100 to extract the F1-F0 complex. The suspensions were centrifuged at 50,000 rpm in a Beckman 70.1Ti rotor for 30 min, and the resultant soluble and particulate fractions were assayed for F1 proteins by Western analysis. Step sucrose gradients were used to analyze the properties of F1 subunits in cases where the enzyme was found to be resistant to Triton X-100 extraction. Mitochondria (5 mg/ml) were permeabilized in TEA buffer by a brief exposure to sonic irradiation, and 0.2-ml samples were overlaid on a 4.8-ml discontinuous gradient of Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffered sucrose (20-80%, w/v). The preparation of the step gradients and the centrifugation protocol were as described (19Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Linear sucrose gradients were used to evaluate the size of the F1-F0 complex in mitochondrial supernatants following Triton X-100 extraction. Solubilized protein (0.6 ml) was loaded onto a 4.4-ml 6-20% sucrose gradient prepared in 0.1% Triton X-100-supplemented TEA buffer, and the gradients were centrifuged at room temperature for 1.5 h at 55,000 rpm in a Beckman SW55Ti rotor. For all experiments, sucrose gradient fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube. The mutant atp2 genes were cloned by the method of colony hybridization (20Grunstein M. Hogness D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 101-106Crossref Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). Following digestion of yeast genomic DNA with SphI, 7-kilobase fragments were purified from a 1% agarose gel and subcloned into a SphI-cut yeast/E. coli shuttle plasmid (either pRS316, CEN (21Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or YEp352, 2 μ (22Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar)). The mini-SphI libraries were used to transform E. coli, and the colonies were hybridized at 65°C with a nick-translated DNA fragment containing the entire ATP2 gene. The one-step gene replacement method (23Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar) was used to disrupt the chromosomal copy of ATP2 in the respiratory competent haploid yeasts W303-1A and W303-1B. The disruption allele (atp2::LEU2) was constructed by inserting a 2.8-kilobase BglII DNA fragment, carrying the entire LEU2 gene, into the unique BamHI site of the ATP2 reading frame. Wild type W303 strains were transformed with atp2::LEU2 on a linear DNA fragment and the transformants were screened for the stable acquisition of leucine prototrophy that correlated with the loss of respiratory function. Respiratory-deficient, Leu+ integrants of both mating types were obtained. Genetic crosses to ρ° tester strains indicated that the respiratory defect of the disruption strains (W303∇G1) was due solely to a nuclear mutation and Southern analysis verified that the gene disruption occurred at the ATP2 locus (data not shown). Genetic crosses also showed allelism between the disrupted gene in the W303∇G1 strains and atp2 present in the chemically mutagenized yeast strains. Protein concentrations were estimated by the method of Lowry et al. (24Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured by determining the amount of inorganic phosphate released as described previously (25Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9952-9959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in the absence and presence of 10 μg of oligomycin. Restriction endonuclease digestion of DNA, purification and ligation of DNA fragments, E. coli transformation and preparation of bacterial plasmids, and nick translation followed standard protocols (26Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The dideoxy method (27Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52650) Google Scholar) was used to sequence the mutant atp2 genes; both strands of the gene were sequenced using overlapping oligonucleotide primers spaced ∼180-200 nucleotides apart. Yeast transformations were done with the LiAc procedure (28Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). For Western analysis, proteins were separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels run in the electrophoretic system of Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar), modified as described (25Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9952-9959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to optimize resolution of the F1α and β subunit proteins. The procedure of Schmidt et al. (30Schmidt R.J. Myers A.M. Gillham N.W. Boynton F.E. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1984; 1: 317-334PubMed Google Scholar) was used for Western blotting. Antibodies against F1α, F1β, and cytochrome c1 were used at dilutions of 1:2000, 1:3000, and 1:100 respectively. Chemically mutagenized yeast strains belonging to complementation group G1 (17Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) carry mutations in ATP2, the nuclear gene that codes for the β subunit of the F1-F0 ATP synthase. The mutant atp2 genes were cloned from nine G1 strains, and the mutations were sequenced (see “Experimental Procedures”). The position of these mutations in the nucleotide and protein sequences is shown in Table II. A single missense mutation was found in each of the mutants, which alters the sequence of ATP2 relative to the wild type copy present in the parental strain D273-10B/A1 (GenBank™ accession number U46215). Two of the mutations were found in more than one strain: the P179L substitution occurs in the strains C103 and E210, and the mutation E222K is present in the strains E430 and E144. 1The biochemical characteristics are described for the mutants E210 and E430 as the strains representative of the P179L and E222K mutations, respectively. The mutation in strain E700 converts the initiator methionine to isoleucine. Since this mutation does not provide information on residues involved in F1 biogenesis or catalysis, it will not be discussed further.Table IIDescription of atp2 mutationsatp2 mutantNucleotideCodon changeAmino acid changeE7003ATG → ATAM1IP133398GGT → GATG133DE210536CCT → CTTP179LC103536CCT → CTTP179LP159575GCA → GTAA192VE430664GAA → AAAE222KE144664GAA → AAAE222KN123680GGT → GATG227DE588878AGA → AAAR293K Open table in a new tab The amount of oligomycin-sensitive mitochondrial ATPase activity present in the mutant haploid strains is shown in Table III. All of the mutations produce a near complete loss (≥93%) of ATPase activity. Western blots (Fig. 1) were used to determine the amount of F1β subunit in each of the atp2 mutants; these values are also reported in Table III. The level of F1β subunit protein ranges from 44 to 85% the control level and thus does not account for the reduction in mitochondrial ATPase activity observed in the mutant strains.Table III.ATPase activity of haploid yeast atp2 mutantsStrain (mutation)Amount β subunitaThe amount of F1β subunit protein was determined using an AMBIS 4000 imaging system to scan Western blots of total mitochondrial protein.

Open table in a new tab The effect of the mutations on the assembly of F1-F0 was also studied. The manner in which the F1α and β subunits distribute between soluble and particulate fractions when wild type and mutant mitochondria are extracted with 0.25% Triton X-100 is shown in the Western blots of Fig. 2. In the wild type (D273) the α and β subunits distribute almost equally between the two fractions, indicating that this procedure solubilizes approximately 40-50% of the F1-F0 from the inner mitochondrial membrane. The strains P159, E430, and E588 show evidence for mutant β subunits with solubility properties that are comparable to those of the wild type protein. These strains were studied further to determine if the mutant protein is assembled into an F1-F0 complex of the correct size. Soluble Triton X-100 extracts of mitochondria prepared from D273, and from the strains P159, E430, and E588, were centrifuged through linear sucrose gradients and the position of the F1α and β subunit proteins was determined by Western analysis (Fig. 3). The F1 proteins in the mutant and the wild type samples showed comparable sedimentation properties. This result suggests that the A192V, E222K, and R293K mutations do not interfere with the formation of the F1-F0 structure.Fig. 3Western analysis of linear sucrose gradient fractions. Mitochondria, prepared from the yeast strains shown, were extracted with 0.25% Triton X-100, and aliquots of the soluble fractions were centrifuged through 6-20% linear sucrose gradients as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Twenty fractions of equivalent volume were collected from the bottom of the tube, and 15 μl of each fraction were analyzed to detect the F1α and β subunits by Western analysis as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The position of the α and β subunit bands are indicated in the left-hand margin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the mutant strains E210 (P179L mutation), P133 (G133D mutation), and D123 (G227D mutation) virtually all of the β subunit, and most of the α subunit, sediment in the particulate fraction after Triton solubilization of the mitochondrial membrane (data shown for strain E210 in Fig. 2). This pattern of extraction is indicative of a defect in F1-F0 assembly (19Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The nature of this defect was investigated further by centrifuging permeabilized mitochondria through 20-80% step-sucrose gradients (see “Experimental Procedures”) to determine if the insoluble F1α and β protein is membrane-bound or in an aggregated form (19Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Fractions from the gradient were analyzed on Western blots for the F1α and β subunits and for cytochrome c1. The latter protein remains membrane-bound under the conditions used to permeabilize the mitochondria and serves to mark the position of the inner membrane in the gradient. Fig. 4 shows the results of this experiment for the wild type strain, D273, and for one of the atp2 mutants (E210) that harbors insoluble F1 protein. In the wild type (D273) the F1α and β subunits co-sediment with cytochrome c1 (peak at fraction 6), indicating that most of the F1 remains bound to F0 in the inner membrane under the conditions of the experiment (see also 19Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the mutant strain E210 the F1 subunits migrate separately from cytochrome c1 and peak in the region of high sucrose density (fractions 2 and 3). Results similar to those shown for E210 were obtained with mitochondrial samples from mutant strains P133 and N123 (data not shown). This analysis indicates that the β subunit mutations P179L, G133D, and G227D produce a defect in the assembly of F1 characterized by the intramitochondrial accumulation of α and β subunit in large aggregates (see also 19Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The haploid yeast of the complementation group G1 are complemented in crosses to the wild type, which indicates the strains have recessive mutations in the ATP2 gene. However, in view of the catalytic and structural properties of the F1 enzyme, it may be argued that certain mutations in ATP2 should be partially dominant with respect to a wild type copy of the β subunit gene present in the same cell. There are three β subunits in F1 that are catalytic and the three catalytic sites interact cooperatively during enzyme turnover (1Penefsky H.S. Cross R.L. Adv. Enzymol. 1991; 64: 173-214PubMed Google Scholar, 2Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Studies using chemical (31Bullough D.A. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14171-14177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and photoaffinity (32Ackerman S.H. Grubmeyer C. Coleman P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13765-13772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) labels have shown that inactivating one of the three β subunits attenuates multisite catalysis in F1. Analysis of hybrid forms of E. coli F1, reconstituted in vitro from mixtures of mutant and wild type subunits (either α (33Rao R. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17450-17454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or β (34Noumi T. Taniai M. Kanazawa H. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9196-9201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), also show that inactivating a single catalytic site severely impairs F1 steady-state catalysis. These studies support the notion that the co-synthesis of mutant and wild type β subunits can lead to the formation of hybrid enzymes in vivo in which the cooperative interactions are lost. Alternatively, the presence of a mutant β subunit could exert a partially dominant effect by interfering with the assembly of a stable F1 structure. To investigate if the atp2 mutations we identified are partially dominant over wild type ATP2, catalytic activity of the F1-F0 complex was analyzed in diploid strains formed by crossing the atp2 mutants to the wild type yeast, W303-1A. The level of oligomycin-sensitive ATPase was first measured in mitochondrial samples prepared from each of the strains (Table IV). The mitochondria were then extracted with 0.25% Triton X-100, and the amount of solubilized F1-F0 was quantified from Western blots (Fig. 5, Table IV). Finally, the specific activity of the F1-F0 complex was calculated by dividing the percent mitochondrial ATPase activity by the percent solubilized β subunit protein to give the values reported in the last column of Table IV. Support for using these calculations to determine the level of F1-F0 in the yeast diploids comes from the fact that nonassembled F1 is not extracted with Triton X-100 (19Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and that under identical extraction conditions, the percentage of assembled F1-F0 that is solubilized should be the same in each of the samples. The reference value for F1-F0 catalytic activity is that measured with the double wild type diploid, W303×D273. Interestingly, control amounts of F1-F0 ATPase activity were measured in W303 ∇G1×D273, which is a diploid strain that harbors a single gene for the β subunit (Table IV). This result suggests that expression of ATP2 from either one or two wild type loci provides the diploid cell with the similar complement of the F1-F0 ATP synthaseTable IV.ATPase activity of diploid yeast that synthesize mutant forms of the F1β subunitStrain (mutation)Amount β subunit (soluble)aThe amount of soluble F1β subunit protein was determined using an AMBIS 4000 imaging system to scan Western blots of Triton X-100 mitochondrial extracts.

Open table in a new tab Assuming that random interactions occur among the F1 subunits from both parental cells, there is the potential to form four types of enzyme oligomers in the wild type/mutant diploids: a 3βwt, a 3βmut, and two types of hybrids (2βwt1βmut and 1βwt2βmut). All four enzyme types are expected to form in diploids if the resident mutant β subunit does not affect F1 assembly. With respect to the strains shown in Table IV, this situation applies to W303×P159, W303×E430, and W303×E588. In such strains, the 3βwt and 3βmut enzymes are each expected to comprise 12.5% of the total F1 oligomer population; the hybrid forms constitute, cumulatively, the remaining 75% of enzyme (35Walpole R.E. Myers R.H. Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists. 2nd Ed. Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc., New York1978: 12Google Scholar). Since the P159, E430, and E588 haploid strains are devoid of ATPase activity (Table III), it is assumed that the 3βmut F1 formed in the derivative diploid cells is inactive. In cases where the 3βmut F1 is the only inactive form of the enzyme, the maximal level of ATPase activity expected for the diploid strain is 87.5% (cumulative activity from the 3βwt and hybrid enzymes). This value is within 5% error of the ATPase activity observed for W303×P159 (Table IV). Therefore, it would appear that this particular diploid forms fully active F1 hybrids in addition"
