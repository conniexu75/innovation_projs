The walls were hydrolyzed and ex- amined qualitatively and quantitatively for phosphorus, am- monia, different reducing sugars and amino sugars, and, in all but a few instances, for sugar alcohols and D- and L-amino acids. The principal aldohexose found was glucose; galactose occurred in fewer cells. Rhamnose was an important component of many of the cell walls and always occurred together with glucose. All of the cell walls contained glucosamine and muramic acid; a few contained galactosamine as well. Ribitol or glycerol was present in walls of all of the organisms tested except L. casei. Absence of any sugar alcohol from the wall of L. casei indicates that the teichoic acids (29), although frequently prominent, are not an obligatory feature of the walls of gram-positive organisms. Glutamic acid, alanine, and either diaminopimelic acid or aspartic acid plus lysine were the principal amino acids present. Most or all of the glutamic acid was present in the n-form; from one- to two-thirds of the alanine was n-alanine, and from two- to four-fifths of the aspartic acid was n-aspartic acid. Only L-lysine was present. Some but not all of the wall hydrolysates contained substantial amounts of e-aminosuccinoyllysine. From two to six additional amino acids were present in smaller, but frequently substantial amounts. No obvious regularities in structure of walls of different organisms became evident from an examination of the mole ratios components determined. Instead, a rather striking divergence in both qualitative and quantitative composition of the walls this rather closely re- lated group of bacteria became evident. Summation of the known components of these walls accounts for only about 60 to 80% of the total wall hydrolyzed, and thus points to presence of presently unrecognized components these structures.

https://openalex.org/W2016098262,The incidence of nontasters for phenylthiocarbamide was found to be significantly higher in 27 athyreotic cretins than in normal adults and children. A significant increase of nontasters among the parents and siblings of these cretins was also found. These findings are discussed in relation to maldevelopment of the fetal thyroid in nontaster genotypes.

https://openalex.org/W2037074388,"HUENNEKENS et al.1 purified an erythrocyte fraction containing hæm which was able to catalyse the reduction of methæmoglobin by reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide in the presence of methylene blue. A single enzyme was believed to be responsible for the electron transport from reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide to the dye, and from the dye through hæm to methæmoglobin. Although reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide-cytochrome c reductase from pig heart and reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide-cytochrome c reductase from yeast do not reduce methæmoglobin, it was shown by Cromier and Rostorfer2 that bacterial extracts with diaphorase activity, as well as milk xanthine oxidase, do reduce methæmoglobin in the presence of methylene blue, suggesting that dia-phorases could also act similarly to methæmoglobin."

Parallel results were previously reported for meaningful verbal material. It is argued that the same perceptual processes underlie the learning of nonsense and of meaningful material.

https://openalex.org/W2042431736,"THE experimental data concerning the hormonal regulation of adrenal glomerulosa and its mineralocorticoid production1 are still inconclusive. The demonstrated dependence of the glomerulosa reaction on the presence of pituitary2 as well as on adrenocorticotrophic hormone3 is contradictory to the absence of increased aldosterone secretion by adrenals perfused with either adrenocorticotrophic or somatistrophic hormone in vitro
4. Nevertheless, it can be assumed that the former, and stress, activate the adrenal glomerulosa indirectly5, mediated by the pituitary-dependent glucocorticoid production, which becomes properly balanced by means of mineralocorticoids6. This view will be supplemented by further experimental results."
