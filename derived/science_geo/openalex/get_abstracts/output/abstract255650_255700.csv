https://openalex.org/W2166841658,"The cornea is one of the few tissues in the body with no blood vessels flowing through it. This blood-vessel-free island is often used to test anti-angiogenic therapies for cancer, arthritis, atherosclerosis, diabetes and other diseases driven by pathological angiogenesis. This lack of blood vessels is remarkable because of the highly vascular nature of the surrounding tissues; doubly remarkable because the cornea has now been found to contain large amounts of the potent angiogenic molecule VEGF-A (vascular endothelial growth factor). This discovery has led to a finding that could be important in terms of drug design: a VEGF-A trap known as soluble VEGFR-1 is also present in the cornea and is singly responsible for the absence of blood vessels there. Intriguingly, the few known organisms that have a vascularized cornea (manatees, mutant mice, and some aniridia patients with Pax6 mutations) are all deficient in corneal soluble VEGFR-1. Corneal avascularity—the absence of blood vessels in the cornea—is required for optical clarity and optimal vision, and has led to the cornea being widely used for validating pro- and anti-angiogenic therapeutic strategies for many disorders1,2,3,4. But the molecular underpinnings of the avascular phenotype have until now remained obscure5,6,7,8,9,10 and are all the more remarkable given the presence in the cornea of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, a potent stimulator of angiogenesis, and the proximity of the cornea to vascularized tissues. Here we show that the cornea expresses soluble VEGF receptor-1 (sVEGFR-1; also known as sflt-1) and that suppression of this endogenous VEGF-A trap11 by neutralizing antibodies, RNA interference or Cre-lox-mediated gene disruption abolishes corneal avascularity in mice. The spontaneously vascularized corneas of corn1 and Pax6+/- mice12,13 and Pax6+/- patients with aniridia14 are deficient in sflt-1, and recombinant sflt-1 administration restores corneal avascularity in corn1 and Pax6+/- mice. Manatees, the only known creatures uniformly to have vascularized corneas15, do not express sflt-1, whereas the avascular corneas of dugongs, also members of the order Sirenia, elephants, the closest extant terrestrial phylogenetic relatives of manatees, and other marine mammals (dolphins and whales) contain sflt-1, indicating that it has a crucial, evolutionarily conserved role. The recognition that sflt-1 is essential for preserving the avascular ambit of the cornea can rationally guide its use as a platform for angiogenic modulators, supports its use in treating neovascular diseases, and might provide insight into the immunological privilege of the cornea."

https://openalex.org/W2086105638,"Antigen presenting cells recognize pathogens via pattern recognition receptors (PRR), which upon ligation transduce intracellular signals that can induce innate immune responses. Because some C-type lectin-like receptors (e.g. dectin-1 and DCSIGN) were shown to act as PRR for particular microbes, we considered a similar role for dectin-2. Binding assays using soluble dectin-2 receptors showed the extracellular domain to bind preferentially to hyphal (rather than yeast/conidial) components of Candida albicans, Microsporum audouinii, and Trichophyton rubrum. Selective binding for hyphae was also observed using RAW macrophages expressing dectin-2, the ligation of which by hyphae or cross-linking with dectin-2-specific antibody led to protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Because dectin-2 lacks an intracellular signaling motif, we searched for a signal adaptor that permits it to transduce intracellular signals. First, we found that the Fc receptor γ (FcRγ) chain can bind to dectin-2. Second, ligation of dectin-2 on RAW cells induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FcRγ, activation of NF-κB, internalization of a surrogate ligand, and up-regulated secretion of tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. Finally, these dectin-2-induced events were blocked by PP2, an inhibitor of Src kinases that are mediators for FcRγ chain-dependent signaling. We conclude that dectin-2 is a PRR for fungi that employs signaling through FcRγ to induce innate immune responses.

Binding of pathogens to particular PRR transduce intracellular signals and biologic consequences that may overlap, even synergize, with those of other PRR. For example, ligation of TLR2 alone on macrophages by zymosan (containing β-glucan) led to secretion of IL-12 and TNFα, and ligation of dectin-1 alone by zymosan resulted in production of reactive oxygen species (but not of IL-12 nor TNFα), whereas coligation of TLR-2 and dectin-1 by zymosan enhanced secretion of IL-12 and TNFα at levels higher than those induced by TLR-2 alone (17Gantner B.N. Simmons R.M. Canavera S.J. Akira S. Underhill D.M. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ligation of DC-SIGN on dendritic cells (DC) inhibited TLR-induced IL-12 expression, while stimulating IL-10 expression (12Geijtenbeek T.B. Van Vliet S.J. Koppel E.A.

Subtractive cDNA cloning of the XS52 line of epidermal Langerhans cell-like DC (18Xu S. Ariizumi K. Caceres-Dittmar G. Edelbaum D. Hashimoto K. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. J.

Both are type II-configured transmembrane proteins with extracellular domains containing a carbohydrate recognition domain highly conserved among C-type lectins (19Ariizumi K. Shen G.L. Ritter R.

Dectin-1 is expressed widely by APC (21Taylor P.R. Brown G.D. Reid D.M. Willment J.A. Martinez-Pomares L. Gordon S. Wong S.Y. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 3876-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) and is a PRR for β-glucan in yeasts (15Brown G.D. Herre J. Williams D.L. Willment J.A. Marshall A.S. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). Dectin-2 is constitutively expressed at very high levels by mature DC and can be inducibly expressed on macrophages after activation (20Ariizumi K. Shen G.L. Shikano S. Ritter R. II I Zukas P.

Here we report that dectin-2 is a PRR for fungi that employ Fc receptor γ (FcRγ) chain signaling to induce internalization, activate NF-κB, and up-regulate production of TNFα and IL-1ra. Microbial Cell Cultures—We obtained Candida albicans (ATCC 10231 and 14053), Microsporum audouinii (ATCC 10008), Trichophyton rubrum (ATCC 14001), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 10145) from the American Type Culture Collection; Escherichia coli DH5α from Invitrogen; Staphylococcus aureus without protein A from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR); Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y187 from Clontech; and group A Streptococci from the Section of Infectious Disease, Department of Pediatrics, the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (Dallas, TX). Each microbial strain was grown in media recommended by the ATCC. C. albicans yeast transformed to pseudohyphae (herein referred to as hyphae) as follows. Freshly prepared yeast was resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and 10% heat-inactivated FCS, seeded on 96-well plates or ELISA plates (2-4 × 105 cells/well), and then incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. Construction of Expression Vectors—To produce soluble dectin-1 and dectin-2 receptors, we inserted a nucleotide fragment encoding the extracellular domain of either molecule into an expression vector, pSTB-Fc (23Shikano S. Bonkobara M. Zukas P.K. Ariizumi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8125-8134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), that allows secretion of the Fc portion of human IgG1 into the culture supernatant of mammalian cells. Respective nucleotide fragments encoding for extracellular domains of dectin-1 and dectin-2 were obtained by PCR amplification of the full-length cDNA with primers containing BamHI (forward primer) and XbaI (reverse primer) restriction enzyme sites at the 5′-end for dectin-1 or containing HindIII and XbaI sites for dectin-2. PCR fragments remaining after digestion with restriction enzymes were linked separately in-frame to the 5′-end of a nucleotide for the Fc in pSTB-Fc (pSTB-Dec1-Fc or pSTB-Dec2-Fc). Lentiviral vectors encoding dectin-2 or dectin-1 tagged with the C-terminal V5 epitope were also constructed. Full-length dectin-2- or dectin-1-coding sequence was excised from an original cDNA clone (20Ariizumi K. Shen G.L. Shikano S. Ritter R. II I Zukas P. Edelbaum D. Morita A. Takashima A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11957-11963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) by PCR amplification with the forward primer containing a HindIII (or BamHI) restriction site and the reverse primer containing an ApaI site linked to a sequence (TACCCCTACGACGTGCCCGACTACGCC) encoding for a V5 epitope (GKPIPNPLLGLDST) at the 5′-end. Using these restriction sites, the PCR product was inserted into a mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) (pcDNA-Dec2V5 or pcDNA-Dec1V5). The nucleotide sequence for dectin-2-V5 (or dectin-1-V5) was excised from pcDNA-Dec2V5 (or pcDNA-Dec1V5) by restriction enzyme digestion with PmeI (a blunt end cutter) and NotI. The lentiviral vector plasmid, pHR-SIN-CSGW dlNotI (24Palmowski M.J. Lopes L. Ikeda Y. Salio M. Cerundolo V. Collins M.K. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 1582-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (gift from Y. Ikeda, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN), was digested with BamHI and NotI restriction enzymes to remove a nucleotide encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein. After end-filling the BamHI site with Klenow fragments, the lentiviral vector was ligated to the nucleotide for dectin-2-V5 (or dectin-1-V5) using the blunt end and the NotI site. Preparation of infectious particles and their titration were performed according to established protocols (25Zufferey R. Nagy D. Mandel R.J. Naldini L. Trono D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar). Mouse FcRγ chain expression vector (pcDNA-mγchain) was constructed as follows. Total RNA prepared from RAW264.7 macrophages was reverse-transcribed to the cDNA form and amplified using upper (5′-ATCGGATCCATGATCTCAGCCGTGATCTTG-3′, where boldface letters indicate EcoRI site) and lower (5′-GAATTCCTACTGGGGTGGTTTTTCATGC-3′, BamHI) primers. The resulting PCR product (260 bp) was inserted into pcDNA3.1 using EcoRI and BamHI sites. To determine how dectin-2 associates with the FcRγ chain, we constructed dectin-2 mutants as follows. Mutant R17V with arginine replaced by valine (point mutation) at amino acid 17 of the transmembrane domain was generated following instructions from the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the forward primer (5′-GGAGTCTGCTGGACCCTGGTACTCTGGTCAGCTGCTGTG-3′, boldface letter indicates the mutated nucleotide), and the reverse primer (5′-CACAGCAGCTGACCAGAGTACCAGGGTCCAGCAGACTCC-3′). Mutant ΔICD lacking the entire intracellular domain (amino acids 1-14) was generated by PCR amplification using the forward primer (5′-CGAAGCTTGCCACCATGACCCTGAGACTCTGGTCA-3′) containing the HindIII site (in boldface) and the reverse primer (5′-TGTGTCCTCGAGTAGGTAAATCTTCTTCATTTC-3′) containing the XhoI site. The resulting PCR fragment was ligated to the HindIII and XhoI sites of pcDNA-V5 vector that encodes the C-terminal V5 epitope. The same strategy using a different forward primer (5′-CCCAAGCTT (HindIII) GCCACCATGCAAGGGAAGGGAGTC-3′) was used to generate mutant Δ1/2ICD in which half the N-terminal intracellular domain (amino acids 1-7) is deleted. Finally, the chimeric mutant 40LECD was generated by fusing the intracellular and transmembrane domains of dectin-2 to the extracellular domain of CD40 ligand (CD40L). A nucleotide fragment coding for the two domains of dectin-2 was extracted from dectin-2 cDNA by PCR amplification using the forward primer (5′-CGGCTAGC(NheI site)GCCACCATGGTGCAGGAAAGACAA-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-CGAAGCTT(HindIII)TTGGTAAGTCACCACACAGCT-3′). A fragment for the extracellular domain of CD40L was prepared using the forward primer (5′-CGAAGCTT(HindIII) ATAGAAGATTGGATAAGGTC-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-TGTGTCCTCGAG(XhoI)GAGTTTGAGTAAGCC-3′). The two fragments were then subcloned in the NheIXhoI sites of pcDNA-V5 vector. Nucleotide sequences of all mutants were confirmed by sequencing. Gene Delivery to Mammalian Cells—COS-1 cells (5 × 105 cells/dish) were treated with an expression vector DNA (2 μg) and 6 μg of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and then cultured for 2-3 days. RAW264.7 cells (5 × 105) were infected with lentivirus encoding dectin-2-V5 (or dectin-1-V5) at a multiplication of infection (m.o.i.) of 20. The next day, the infected cells were enriched for surface expression of dectin-2-V5 (or dectin-1-V5) using immuno-magnetic beads. After blocking Fc receptors with 5 μg/ml Fc block (Pharmingen), infected RAW cells (5 × 105) were incubated with mouse anti-V5 Ab (2 μg/ml; Serotec, Raleigh, NC) and biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (5 μg/ml, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) on ice for 60 min and treated with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Miltenyi, Auburn, CA). Bead-bound cells were collected and cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS. This enrichment was repeated 3-4 times, followed by analysis of the purity of the cell suspension by FACS. Greater than 90% of RAW cells expressed dectin-2-V5 (or dectin-1-V5) on their surfaces (Fig. 3B). Purification of Fc Fusion Proteins—Three days after transfecting COS-1 cells with expression vectors for Fc fusion proteins, the culture supernatant was recovered, and Fc fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography as described previously (23Shikano S. Bonkobara M. Zukas P.K. Ariizumi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8125-8134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations of Fc fusion preparations were measured using the Bradford method and purity assessed by SDS-PAGE/Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (single band) and by Western blotting (reactivity for anti-dectin-2 Ab). Binding Assays for Microbes—Aliquots of freshly cultured bacteria (0.1 OD600), S. cerevisiae and C. albicans yeasts (0.5-1 × 106 cells each), or hyphae (4 × 105 cells) were washed with Dulbecco's PBS (DPBS) and incubated with staining buffer (0.1% BSA, 2 mm CaCl2, DPBS) containing 20 μg/ml Fc proteins on ice for 1 h. After extensive washing with buffer, cells were resuspended in 5 μg/ml of biotinylated goat anti-human IgG F(ab′)2 Ab (Jackson ImmunoResearch) on ice for 30 min, followed by incubation with 1:200-diluted FITC-avidin (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). We also stained filamentous fungi (M. audouinii, and T. rubrum) as follows. Single colonies of fungi were grown on Sabouroud's agar plates, harvested, and suspended in DPBS. After washing with DPBS and with water, small aliquots were spotted on slide glass, air-dried, and stained with Fc proteins as before. Binding of Fc proteins to microbes was examined using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope with 488 nm excitation and transmitted light detection (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Thornwood, NY). Quantitative Binding Assays—Fc protein (20 or 40 μg) was iodinated with 200 or 400 μCi of Na125I (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) at room temperature for 10 min in the presence of a rehydrated IODO-BEADs (Pierce). The reaction was stopped by removing the beads and diluting with 0.1% BSA/DPBS, followed by dialysis with CaCl2/DPBS until background levels of radioactivity were detected in the dialysis buffer. Radioactivity incorporated into Fc protein was measured by 125I cpm in the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction. Specific activity was expressed as incorporated cpm/total input/μg (typically 1-2 × 106 cpm/μg). Iodinated Fc proteins were used to quantitate binding of Fc proteins to C. albicans. Freshly cultured yeasts (5 × 105 cells) or hyphae (4 × 105 cells) were incubated with different doses of 125I-labeled Fc protein on ice for 1 h (two sets in triplicate). After extensive washing with CaCl2/DPBS, one set was left untreated, air-dried, and measured for radioactivity bound to C. albicans using a γ-counter. The other set was incubated with acidic buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine-HCl buffer, pH 2.3) or 10 mm EDTA (for Ca2+-dependent binding) on ice for 5 min, followed by washing. Residual radioactivity was regarded as background. Specific binding was expressed as the counts/min left after subtracting average background counts/min from untreated counts/min. The amount of Fc proteins bound to C. albicans was calculated as specific binding cpm/specific activity of 125I-Fc protein. For experiments measuring specific binding of Dec2-Fc to hyphae, hyphae (2 × 105 cells) were pretreated with various concentrations of Fc protein on ice for 1 h (triplicate). After removing unbound Fc proteins by washing, 1 μg/ml of 125I-Dec2-Fc was added to pretreated and untreated hyphae and then incubated on ice for another 1 h. A set of tubes was incubated with 125I-Dec2-Fc in the presence of 10 mm EDTA, and Ca2+-dependent binding activity was calculated as before. The ability of polysaccharide to inhibit Dec1-Fc or Dec2-Fc binding to hyphae or yeasts was assayed as follows: yeast or hyphae (1 × 106 or 2 × 105 cells/ELISA well) were washed with 0.1% BSA/DPBS/CaCl2 and incubated with 125 I-Dec1-Fc or 125I-Dec2-Fc (1 μg/ml) in the presence of laminarin or mannan (both from Sigma) on ice for 1 h. After extensive washing, C. albicans-bound and background radioactivities were measured as before. Binding of Transfectants to C. albicans—The following procedures were followed for binding of COS-1 transfectants to C. albicans hyphae. A day after transfecting COS-1 cells with expression vectors for full-length dectin-1-V5 or dectin-2-V5, or an empty vector, cells were re-seeded on 60-mm culture dishes (5 × 105 cells/dish) and metabolically labeled with [3H]thymidine (ICN Biochemicals, 1 μCi/dish) for 16 h. Cells were then harvested by pipetting in 0.02% EDTA/DPBS. After washing with 10% FCS/RPMI (cRPMI), specific activity of labeled cells (cpm/cell) was determined. Cells in increasing numbers were added to hyphae grown in 96-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well, in triplicate) and cultured in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 1 h. Amphotericin B (Sigma) was added to block fungal growth (final concentration of 2.5 μg/ml). Unbound COS-1 cells were removed by washing with cRPMI 10 times; cells bound to hyphae were lysed by incubation with 0.3% Triton X-100/PBS (200 μl/well) at room temperature for 20 min. For binding of RAW cells to C. albicans hyphae, the RAW parental cells or those expressing dectin-1-V5 or dectin-2-V5 were metabolically labeled with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/culture) by overnight incubation. After measuring specific radioactivity (cpm/cell), labeled cells (3 × 104 cells/well) were incubated in ELISA wells just treated with 0.1% BSA/PBS or where hyphae were grown (104 cells/well). After culturing at 37 °C for 30 min, wells were washed with 0.1% BSA/PBS 10 times and lysed with 100 μl of 0.3% Triton X-100/PBS, and 3H counts were determined. The number of cells adherent to a well was computed by dividing 3H counts/min from a well by specific activity. For binding of RAW cells to C. albicans yeasts (26Gantner B.N. Simmons R.M. Underhill D.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), freshly grown yeasts were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 0.1 mg/ml FITC (Sigma) at room temperature for 1 h. After extensive washing, FITC-labeled yeasts were resuspended in 10% FCS-HBSS. RAW cells (5 × 105) were incubated with FITC-labeled yeasts at indicated m.o.i. values for 30 min at room temperature. After removing unbound yeasts by extensive washing, cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at 4 °C, washed, and then analyzed using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Histograms were made from fluorescent signals after removal of free FITC-yeasts by gating out the small sized population using forward/side scatter analysis. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—To measure protein expression of dectin molecules in RAW cells, whole cell extracts were prepared from cells by lysis in RIPA buffer (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm EDTA) and subsequent centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Small aliquots were applied to 4 -20% SDS-PAGE, then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond P; Amersham Biosciences), followed by immunoblotting using mouse anti-V5 Ab (0.5 μg/ml), affinity-purified rabbit anti-dectin-1 oligopeptide (1 μg/ml) (19Ariizumi K. Shen G.L. Ritter R. II I Kumamoto T. Edelbaum D. Morita A. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. J. Biol.

After washing, the membrane was blotted further with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab and then developed using the ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences). For protein tyrosine phosphorylation, RAW cells (2.5 × 106) were starved by culturing for 1 h in serum-free DMEM, incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and cocultured with yeast or hyphae (7.5 × 106 each) in 24-well plates. At different time points after incubation at 37 °C, cells were chilled on ice and lysed by addition of 10× lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm EDTA) to terminate phosphorylation. The clear lysate was prepared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min and subjected to Western blot analysis using 1:1,000-diluted horseradish peroxidase anti-phosphotyrosine Ab (PY-plus, Zymed Laboratories Inc.). To examine association of dectin-2 with the FcRγ chain, whole cell extracts were prepared from Dec2V5-RAW or parental macrophages (1 × 106 cells) using a lysis buffer (1% Brij 55, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm Na2VO4, 50 mm NaF, proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) and incubated with mouse anti-V5 (2 μg) or mouse anti-human FcRγ chain 7D3.5 mAb (Note: the mAb we originally developed has cross-reactivity to mouse FcRγ) (3 μg) at 4 °C for 16 h, followed by precipitation with 10 μl of 50% slurry protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science). After washing the agarose beads, the immunoprecipitates were dissociated from the beads by boiling and then subjected to Western blotting using anti-FcRγ Ab or rat anti-dectin-2 mAb (each 2 μg/ml). The interaction was also examined in COS-1 cells (1 × 106 cells) cotransfected with two expression vectors encoding for dectin-2-V5 and FcRγ (pcDNA-mγchain), respectively. To measure phosphorylation of the FcRγ chain, Dec2V5-RAW or RAW parental cells (1 × 106 cells in 100 μl of PBS) were incubated with anti-V5 Ab (5 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 40 min. After extensive washing, cells were treated with goat antimouse IgG (20 μg/ml) at 37 °C at various time periods and lysed using 100 μl of 2× lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm Na2VO4, 50 mm NaF, proteinase inhibitor mix (Sigma)). In some experiments, RAW cells were pretreated with PP2 or PP3 kinase inhibitor at 37 °C for 2 h. Protein extracts were prepared, immunoprecipitated with anti-FcRγ chain Ab, and then blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine Ab 4G10 (1 μg/ml) (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Lake Placid, NY) or anti-FcRγ chain Ab. RAW cells (2.5 × 106) were also treated with C. albicans hyphae or yeasts (3 × 106) at 37 °C at different time periods. Tyrosine phosphorylation was examined as described previously. Immunofluorescence Staining—Binding of Dec2V5-RAW cells to hyphae was also studied using microscopy. Hyphae (3 × 105 cells/well) grown in 2-well chamber slides (Lab-Tek Products, Naperville, IL) were labeled with 100 μg/ml TRITC (Sigma) in 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate, pH 8.3, at room temperature for 30 min. Free TRITC was removed completely by extensive washing with PBS. Dec2V5-RAW cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) were pretreated with 1% mouse serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in 10% FCS/HBSS on ice for 10 min and surfacelabeled with 2 μg/ml FITC-anti-V5 Ab on ice for 1 h. After washing three times with 10% FCS/HBSS, surface-labeled RAW cells (3 × 105 cells/ml) were resuspended in complete DMEM containing 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B and then cultured with TRITC-labeled hyphae (3 × 105 RAW cells/well). At different time points after incubating at 37 °C, media were removed, and the cells fixed immediately with 10% formaldehyde/PBS. Finally, immunofluorescence microscopy was performed at the Live Cell Imaging Facility at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School. Fluorescence images were taken under confocal microscopy and analyzed using 488 nm excitation for FITC and 543 nm for TRITC. To determine subcellular localization of dectin-2 and FcRγ, RAW cells (5 × 105) were incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-V5 Ab (10 μg/ml) (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing with PBS, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 20 min at room temperature, cytospun to a slide glass, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 2 min. The slide glass was incubated with mouse anti-FcRγ chain Ab (1 μg/ml) at room temperature for 1 h and stained with Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-mouse or 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (each 1:1,000 dilution) (Molecular Probes).

https://openalex.org/W2144278357,"Three papers in this issue report the first X-ray structures of C3b, the active form of human complement C3. The complement system is a family of blood serum proteins and cell-surface receptors that recognizes pathogens and unleashes the immune response against them. The powerhouse of the C3 protein is a thioester group: when activated it binds to an acceptor on the pathogen and marks it for destruction. There are similar thioesters in host cells too, so the C3 thioester has to be kept tightly under wraps. Knowledge of the structure of the active form of C3b is a step towards designing therapies to manipulate the complement system. Inappropriate activation of the complement system has been implicated in various diseases including arthritis, asthma, lupus erythematosus, autoimmune heart disease and multiple sclerosis. Resistance to infection and clearance of cell debris in mammals depend on the activation of the complement system, which is an important component of innate and adaptive immunity1,2. Central to the complement system is the activated form of C3, called C3b, which attaches covalently to target surfaces3 to amplify complement response, label cells for phagocytosis and stimulate the adaptive immune response. C3b consists of 1,560 amino-acid residues and has 12 domains. It binds various proteins and receptors to effect its functions4. However, it is not known how C3 changes its conformation into C3b and thereby exposes its many binding sites. Here we present the crystal structure at 4-Å resolution of the activated complement protein C3b and describe the conformational rearrangements of the 12 domains that take place upon proteolytic activation. In the activated form the thioester is fully exposed for covalent attachment to target surfaces and is more than 85 Å away from the buried site in native C3 (ref. 5). Marked domain rearrangements in the α-chain present an altered molecular surface, exposing hidden and cryptic sites that are consistent with known putative binding sites of factor B and several complement regulators. The structural data indicate that the large conformational changes in the proteolytic activation and regulation of C3 take place mainly in the first conversion step, from C3 to C3b. These insights are important for the development of strategies to treat immune disorders that involve complement-mediated inflammation."

https://openalex.org/W2048774799,"Transport of cholesterol into the mitochondria is the rate-determining, hormone-sensitive step in steroid biosynthesis. Here we report that the mechanism underlying mitochondrial cholesterol transport involves the formation of a macromolecular signaling complex composed of the outer mitochondrial membrane translocator protein (TSPO), previously known as peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor; the TSPO-associated protein PAP7, which binds and brings to mitochondria the regulatory subunit RIα of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKARIα); and the hormone-induced PKA substrate, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR). Hormone treatment of MA-10 Leydig cells induced the co-localization of TSPO, PAP7, PKARIα, and StAR in mitochondria, visualized by confocal microscopy, and the formation in living cells of a high molecular weight multimeric complex identified using photoactivable amino acids. The hormone-induced recruitment of exogenous TSPO in this complex was found to parallel the increased presence of 7-azi-5α-cholestan-3β-ol in the samples. Co-expression of Tspo, Pap7, PkarIα, and Star genes resulted in the stimulation of steroid formation in both steroidogenic MA-10 and non-steroidogenic COS-F2-130 cells that were engineered to metabolize cholesterol. Disruption of these protein-protein interactions and specifically the PKARIα-PAP7 and PAP7-TSPO interactions, using PAP7 mutants where the N0 area homologous to dual A-kinase-anchoring protein-1 or the acyl-CoA signature motif were deleted or using the peptide Ht31 known to disrupt the anchoring of PKA, inhibited both basal and hormone-induced steroidogenesis. These results suggest that the initiation of cAMP-induced protein-protein interactions results in the formation of a multivalent scaffold in the outer mitochondrial membrane that mediates the effect of hormones on mitochondrial cholesterol transport and steroidogenesis.

These results suggest that the initiation of cAMP-induced protein-protein interactions results in the formation of a multivalent scaffold in the outer mitochondrial membrane that mediates the effect of hormones on mitochondrial cholesterol transport and steroidogenesis. Steroids are formed by several successive enzymatic transformations of the substrate cholesterol in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (1Payne A.H. Hales D.B. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 947-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). The rate-determining step for steroidogenesis is the transport of the precursor, cholesterol, from intracellular sources into the mitochondria (2Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. Can. J. Biochem.

This step is regulated by trophic hormones, such as adrenocorticotropic hormone, in adrenocortical cells and luteinizing hormone in testicular Leydig and ovarian cells that act via G-protein-coupled receptors to activate adenylate cyclase and induce the formation of cAMP (1Payne A.H.

Steroid Biochem. 1999; 69: 367-378Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Protein phosphorylation has been shown to be one of the regulatory steps in hormone-stimulated steroid formation (2Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1983; 61: 92-107Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 5Kimura T. J. Steroid Biochem. 1986; 25: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This is a highly efficient and rapid process where minimal amounts of cAMP are needed to induce a maximal rate of cholesterol transport and steroid synthesis within minutes upon exposure of the cells to hormones (6Catt K.J. Hardwood J.P. Clayton R.N. Davies T.F. Chan V. Katikineni M. Nozu K. Dufau M.L. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1980; 36: 557-662PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying this amplification process targeted to the mitochondria remains unknown. However, a number of proteins have been shown to be critical in this process. The steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) is a hormone-sensitive, 37-kDa protein that contains an N-terminal mitochondrial signal sequence (3Jefcoate C.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 881-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 7Stocco D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In both gonadal and adrenal cells, de novo synthesis of StAR parallels maximal steroid synthesis in response to trophic hormones (3Jefcoate C.R. J. Clin.

The newly synthesized StAR is functional and exhibits cholesterol transfer activity (8Artemenko I.P. Zhao D. Hales D.B. Hales K.H. Jefcoate C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46583-46596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) that acts outside of the mitochondria to stimulate steroidogenesis (9Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu Z. Holt J.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M. Miller W.L. Strauss J.F. II I Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13731-13736Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 10Bose H.S. Lingappa V.R. Miller W.L. Nature. 2002; 417: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). This cytosolic preprotein is cleaved in mitochondrial membrane contact sites to produce the 30-kDa “mature” StAR protein, an event that terminates its action (10Bose H.S. Lingappa V.R. Miller W.L. Nature. 2002; 417: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Thus, StAR may function by activating either a mitochondrial receptor or transport mechanism; mitochondrial import and proteolysis may terminate its action. Such cAMP-induced phosphorylation of StAR has also been shown to be important for its function (11Arakane F. King S.R. Du Y. Kallen C.B. Walsh L.P. Watari H. Stocco D.M. Strauss J.F. J. Biol.

Hormones together with cAMP induce a functional and topographical reorganization (polymerization) of TSPO (14Boujrad N. Vidic B. Papadopoulos V.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4509-4519Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that the action of StAR on the outer mitochondrial membrane is mediated by TSPO (16Hauet T. Yao Z.

Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 540-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), suggesting that there may be a cAMP-regulated StAR-TSPO interaction at the mitochondrial level. In search of cytosolic proteins that interact with and regulate TSPO, we identified a TSPO-associated protein, PAP7, that is found primarily in Golgi associated with mitochondria and binds the regulatory subunit RIα of PKA (17Li H. Degenhardt B. Tobin D. Yao Z. Tasken K. Papadopoulos V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2211-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 18Liu J. Cavalli L.R. Haddad B.R. Papadopoulos V. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 308: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that PKARIα is compartmentalized in Leydig cells so that it has preferential access to endogenously produced cAMP (19Moger W.H. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1414-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The compartmentalization of PKA, mediated through the specific binding of R subunits to various organelles, has been proposed as a mechanism to target the response to cAMP (20Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8057-8064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In this regard, PAP7 is a PKARIα-anchoring protein (A-kinase-anchoring protein (AKAP)) that targets the kinase to TSPO-rich mitochondria. Recently the AKAP family was described to recruit the PKA holoenzyme proximally to either its substrate proteins or destination organelles (21Feliciello A. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento E.V. J. Mol.

Metab. 2001; 12: 434-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This compartmentalization of PKA may amplify the cAMP-mediated hormonal response. Reduction or deletion of the Star, Tspo, or Pap7 gene products in either in vivo or in vitro models resulted in the arrest of both basal and hormone-induced steroidogenesis (12Papadopoulos V.

Here we show that hormonal stimulation leads to the formation of a StAR-PKARIα-PAP7-TSPO macromolecular signaling complex in the outer mitochondrial membrane that mediates and amplifies the cAMP signal that initiates cholesterol transport and steroid formation. Cell Culture—MA-10 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 2.5% horse serum (16Hauet T. Yao Z. Bose S.

COS-F2-130 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (27Huang M.C. Miller W.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2569-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). cDNA Cloning and Plasmid Construction—To clone cDNA sequences of the mouse Pap7, Tspo, PkarIα, and Star genes, which include the complete coding regions, primers were designed and synthesized based on the sequences deposited in GenBank™ (Table 1). Total RNA from MA-10 cells was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed. Sequences were amplified with the Advantage 2 PCR polymerase (BD Biosciences). Optimal cycling parameters for the first round of PCR were 95 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 3 min for five cycles, 95 °C for 30 s, 70 °C for 3 min for five cycles, 95 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 3 min for 25 cycles, and a 10-min extension at 72 °C. PCR products were inserted into the TA-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced using M13-forward and M13-reverse primers. The ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit and sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were used for nucleotide sequencing at the Sequencing Core Facility (Georgetown University). Constructs for mammalian expression either alone or fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP), yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), or cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) (purchased from BD Biosciences) were used; the primers for nested PCR were linked with certain restriction nucleotide cleavage sites (Table 1). The parameters were identical to the first round. PCR products were purified using the GeneSpin kit (Qbiogene, Irvine, CA), digested by the relevant enzymes, and subjected to sequencing reactions for further confirmation.TABLE 1Primers for cDNA cloning and mammalian expression plasmid constructionGeneAccession no.PrimersaRestriction sites in primer adaptor are underlined.Vector insertedmPAP7AF022770mPAP7-F2, 5′-AAGTCGATACGTGGCCGCCGCCTGTpCR4-TOPOmPAP7-R2, 5′-CACGGACTCCTATGCGCCACAAAAGTCAmPAP7-F1, 5′-CATGGAATTCAGATGGCGGCGCAGCTGAApEGFP-C3, pEYFP-C1, PEYFP-N1,mPAP7-R1, 5′-AGCGGATCCTGCTCAACCCTAGACTCCCGApcDNA3.1(−)mTSPOD21207mTSPO-F2, 5′-GACTGCGTGAGCGGGGCTGTGGATCTTpCR4-TOPOmTSPO-R2, 5′-CAGCAGGCCCAATGGTCATGAAAGCAmTSPO-F1, 5′-GATCGAATTCATCAGTTGCAATCACCATGCpEGFP-C1, pEGFP-N1,mTSPO-R1, 5′-CGTGGATCCTGGGTGCCTTCACTCTGCpcDNA3.1(−)mPKARIαXM_126543mPKARIA-F1, 5′-GAAAAGACAGAGGCGTGGAGGGAGGCApCR4-TOPOmPKARIA-R1, 5′-CACAGAGAAGCGGTGACAGCCAAGTCCAmPKARIA-F3, 5′-ACCAAAGCTTCAGAGAACCATGGCGTCTGGpEGFP-C3, pcDNA3.1(+)mPKARIA-R3, 5′-AAGGGATCCGCGTGAGTGAAGCATGGACTmStARNM_011485mStAR-F1, 5′-GCGCCACAGCTGCAGGACTCAGGACCTTpCR4-TOPOmStAR-R1, 5′-GCATCCCCTGTTCGTAGCTGCTGGTGTCmStAR-F2, 5′-ACCGGATCCTCAGCATGTTCCTCGCTACpcDNA3.1(+)mStAR-R2, 5′-CAGGAATTCACACTGGGCCTCAGAGGCAa Restriction sites in primer adaptor are underlined. Open table in a new tab Construction of PAP7 Mutants—Two deletions, which were called N0 homologous deletion and acyl-CoA-binding motif deletion, were designed based on the peptide sequence of mouse PAP7 (17Li H. Degenhardt B. Tobin D. Yao Z. Tasken K. Papadopoulos V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2211-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 18Liu J. Cavalli L.R. Haddad B.R. Papadopoulos V. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 308: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To create the N0 homologous deletion, two fragments that connect with the N0 homologous area at both the N- and C-terminal ends were amplified using two primer sets: 5′-ATCATGGCCGACAAGCAGAAGAACG and 5′-GCCCTCAGCCGCCGCCT and 5′-GATGGCAAAGCCTTTCATCCAACTTATG and 5′-AGGTTCAGGGGGAGGTGTGGGA. After purification, the two fragments were ligated using a Rapid Ligation kit (Roche Applied Science). The ligation product was purified and subjected to PCR as the template using primers 5′-ATCATGGCCGACAAGCAGAAGAACG and 5′-AGGTTCAGGGGGAGGTGTGGGA to amplify the coding region without the N0 homologous region. Following another purification step, the amplified N0 homologous deletion fragment was digested by EcoRI and BamHI and inserted into mammalian expressing vector pcDNA3.1(-). The acyl-CoA deletion was created using a similar methodology. The primers to amplify the N- and C-terminal fragments were 5′-ATCATGGCCGACAAGCAGAAGAACG and 5′-GCCGTAAAGCTCCTCCAGGCCAAAG and 5′-GCATATGTTGCGTCCCACAGAATAGA and 5′-AGGTTCAGGGGGAGGTGTGGGA. The primers for the final round of PCR were the same as those of the N0 homologous deletion. Advantage 2 PCR polymerase (BD Biosciences) was used for sequence amplification, and the cycling parameters were 95 °C for 30 s, 61 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 1 min for five cycles, 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles, and a 10-min extension at 72 °C. Transient Transfection—COS-F2-130 and MA-10 cells were transfected using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), respectively. Cells were plated 1 day before transfection. The construction of fusion proteins with PAP7, TSPO, and PKARIα, pEGFP-C1/N1, pEYFP-C1, pEYFP-N1, and pECFP-C1 (BD Biosciences) was used to observe their subcellular localizations under live conditions. Cells were visualized 24-48 h after transfection under either an Olympus fluorescence inverted microscope or an Olympus Fluoview laser scanning microscope (Olympus Inc., Center Valley, PA). For multigene co-transfection, pcDNA3.1(-)-Pap7, pcDNA3.1(-)-Tspo, pcDNA3.1(+)-PkarIα, and pcDNA3.1(+)-Star constructs were used. The pcDNA3.1(+/-) vectors were from Invitrogen. Cells were plated in 48-well plates 1 day before transfection. Each well was transfected with the same amount (1.2 μg) of plasmid DNA. If one reaction contained more than one type of plasmid, the amount of DNA was divided equally. Four parallel wells were used for each transfection. Control cells were transfected either by the same amount of empty vector or with the transfection reagent alone. Confocal Microscopy—For immunocytochemical studies, MA-10 cells were cultured on coverslips in 12-well plates. The next day, cells were either treated with the indicated hormone or compound or subjected to staining. Following washing with PBS, slides were either stained with MitoTracker® Red CMXRos (working concentration, 100 nm; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) or fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min. Slides were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with various primary antibodies. For the co-localization of PAP7 with the Golgi apparatus, mouse PAP7 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:150 dilution; Ref. 17Li H. Degenhardt B. Tobin D. Yao Z. Tasken K. Papadopoulos V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2211-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and a mouse monoclonal antibody against the Golgi apparatus protein syntaxin-6 (1:150 dilution; BD Biosciences) were used. For the co-localization of PAP7 or TSPO with the mitochondria, the slides were incubated with anti-PAP7 or rabbit polyclonal anti-TSPO (1:150 dilution; Ref. 28Li H. Yao Z. Degenhardt B. Teper G. Papadopoulos V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1267-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) as primary antibody, respectively. The monoclonal antibody anti-PKARIα (1:100 dilution) (BD Biosciences) was used to study the co-localization of PKARIα with either PAP7 or TSPO. Slides were then rinsed in PBS three times and incubated for 1 h with two secondary antibodies, fluorescein isothiocyanate-goat antirabbit IgG (1:200 dilution; Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) and rhodamine Red-X-conjugated Affinipure goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200 dilution; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0.1% gelatin, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1% normal goat serum. Slides were then mounted with the Prolong Antifade kit (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and observed under an Olympus Fluoview laser scanning microscope. Steroid Biosynthesis—MA-10 cells were plated onto 96-well plates at 2.5 × 104 cells/well. Media were replaced with serum-free media after 24 h, and cells were treated with or without 10 μg/ml brefeldin A (BFA) (Sigma) for 30 min. Cells were washed with serum-free media and treated with media with or without the indicated concentrations of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for the indicated time periods. Purified hCG was a gift from Dr. A. F. Parlow (National Hormone and Pituitary Program, National Institutes of Health). At the end of the incubation, media were collected, and progesterone levels were determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA) as described previously (16Hauet T. Yao Z. Bose S. Wall C.T. Han Z. Hales B.D. Miller W.L. Culty M. Papadopoulos V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 540-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 17Li H. Degenhardt B. Tobin D. Yao Z. Tasken K. Papadopoulos V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2211-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Anti-progesterone antisera were from ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA) and [1,2,6,7-3H]progesterone (specific activity, 94.1 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Progesterone production was normalized for the amount of protein in each well as determined by the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). RIA data were analyzed using the MultiCalc software (EG&G Wallac, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). To determine steroidogenesis in cells transfected with the various constructs, COS-F2-130 and MA-10 cells were plated onto 48-well plates at 5 × 104 cells/well. Culture media were collected after 48 h of transient transfection. Cells were washed and incubated with the indicated concentrations of hCG in serum-free media for the indicated time periods. In some experiments, the hydrosoluble analog of cholesterol, (22R)-hydroxycholesterol, was used to assess maximal steroidogenic capacity of the cells independent of hormonal stimuli (data not shown). Pregnenolone production in COS-F2-130 cells and pregnenolone and progesterone production in MA-10 cells were measured by RIA. Anti-pregnenolone antisera were from ICN Pharmaceuticals and [7-3H]pregnenolone (specific activity, 17.5 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. To determine the optimal concentration of stearated peptides, Ht31 and Ht31P (Promega, Madison, WI), in MA-10 cells, increasing concentrations (1-50 μm) of the peptides were added to the culture medium for 2 h in the presence and absence of saturating concentrations of hCG. Progesterone produced was measured by RIA. Based on the results obtained with the bioactive peptide Ht31, a concentration of 25 μm was chosen and used to treat cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of hCG for 2 h. In separate experiments, Ht31 and Ht31P were used to treat MA-10 cells 24 h post-transfection with the various constructs under investigation in the presence or absence of hCG for 2 h. Immunoprecipitation—MA-10 cells were plated in 6-well plates 1 day before transfection. Each well was transfected with 4 μg of pEGFP-Tspo, pEGF-PkarIα, or empty vector. Forty-eight hours later, cells were washed and treated with or without saturating concentrations (50 ng/ml) of hCG for 30 min. Each treatment was performed in three parallel wells. At the end of the treatment, cells were then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Samples were precleared by incubation with protein G-Sepharose (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) for 1 h at 4 °C, centrifuged for 30 s at 14,000 rpm, and treated with anti-GFP antibody (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. The samples were then incubated with protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, resuspended in non-reduced sample buffer, and centrifuged for 30 s at 14,000 rpm. Samples were separated on a 4-20% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel under native conditions, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and blotted with anti-StAR (1:1000; Ref. 16Hauet T.

Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Image densitometric analysis of the StAR-immunoreactive protein band was performed using the OptiQuant image analysis software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Photolabeling—MA-10 cells were plated onto 6-well plates. Twenty-four hours later, the media were replaced with media deficient in both leucine and methionine (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Photoleucine and photomethionine, donated by Dr. Thiele (Max Plank Institute, Dresden, Germany), were added to the media at a concentration of 4 mm and incubated for 24 h (30Suchanek M. Radzikowska A. Thiele C. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). At the end of the incubation, cells were washed and treated with media containing 50 ng/ml hCG for the indicated periods of time. Cells were washed with PBS and irradiated with UV light using a 100-watt mercury lamp (Olympus) for 15 min in PBS containing 50 ng/ml hCG; a filter was used to remove wavelengths of light below 350 nm, allowing a peak at 365 nm. Cells were then harvested, and proteins were separated on a 4-20% SDS-polyacrylamide Tris-glycine gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blotted with either anti-TSPO (1:1000), anti-PAP7 (1:1500), anti-PKARIα (1:250; BD Biosciences), anti-StAR (1:200), anti-VDAC1 (1:1000; Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA), anti-adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT) (1:500; Abcam Inc.), or anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1:10,000; Trevigen Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Visualization and image analysis of the immunoreactive proteins were performed as described above. In parallel experiments, COS-F2-130 cells were transfected with Star cDNA, and 24 h later, media were replaced with media deficient in leucine and methionine supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Photoleucine and photomethionine (4 mm) were added to the media and incubated for 24 h. Cells were washed with PBS and irradiated with UV light using a 100-watt mercury lamp for 15 min in PBS. Cells were then harvested, and proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting as described above. To investigate the role of cholesterol in the formation of the 240-kDa complex, the modified cholesterol compound, 7-azi-5α-[3,5,6-3H]cholestan-3β-ol ([3H]photocholesterol, from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO), was used. MA-10 cells were transfected with pEGFP-Tspo, and 24 h later, 5 μCi (83.5 pmol) of [3H]photocholesterol were added to the media together with the artificial amino acids and incubated for 24 h. Cells were treated with hCG and irradiated with UV light as described above. At the end of the treatment, cells were harvested and immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibodies. After separation of the precipitates on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transfer onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, the membrane was blotted with anti-TSPO. Radioactivity in protein precipitates prior to electrophoresis was measured by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired t test and analysis of variance with the Instat (version 3.0) package from GraphPad, Inc. (San Diego, CA).

https://openalex.org/W2092929124,"Histone acetylation has been shown to be required for the proper regulation of many cellular processes including transcription, DNA repair, and chromatin assembly. Acetylation of histone H3 on lysine 56 (H3K56) occurs both during the premeiotic and mitotic S phase and persists throughout DNA damage repair. To learn more about the molecular mechanism of H3K56 acetylation and factors required for this process, we surveyed the genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify genes necessary for this process. A comparative global proteomic screen identified several factors required for global H3K56 acetylation, which included histone chaperone Asf1 and a protein of an unknown function Rtt109 but not Spt10. Our results indicate that the loss of Rtt109 results in the loss of H3K56 acetylation, both on bulk histone and on chromatin, similar to that of asf1Δ or the K56Q mutation. RTT109 deletion exhibits sensitivity to DNA damaging agents similar to that of asf1Δ and H3K56Q mutants. Furthermore, Rtt109 and H3K56 acetylation appear to correlate with actively transcribed genes and associate with the elongating form of polymerase II in yeast. This histone modification is also associated with some of the transcriptionally active puff sites in Drosophila.

Our results indicate a new role for the Rtt109 protein in the proper regulation of H3K56 acetylation. Once referred to as an amorphous coating or passive polymeric counterion of DNA, histone proteins are now known to be integral to the structural organization of eukaryotic DNA and are required for its packaging into chromatin (1Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 285-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). Chromatin appears as a series of “beads on a string,” consisting of individual nucleosome “beads” and the linker DNA “string.” Each nucleosome consists of eight core histone proteins (usually two each of H3, H4, H2A, and H2B) (2Kornberg R.D. Science. 1974; 184: 868-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar, 6Karpen G.H. Allshire R.C. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 489-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). X-ray studies suggest that histone amino termini tails extend outside the core of the nucleosome and are available for interactions with the DNA and/or other proteins (3Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6885) Google Scholar). In fact, histone tails are the sites of many potential structure-altering covalent modifications (7Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 8Shilatifard A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 243-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Posttranslational modifications of histones, including acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation and ubiquitination, occur on the unstructured tail of histones protruding from the core of the nucleosome (3Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6885) Google Scholar, 4Khorasanizadeh S.

Changes in chromatin architecture may be regarded as a regulatory principle allowing discrimination of transcriptionally active and inactive regions that facilitate the execution of a gene expression program and directs the establishment of specialized structures such as centromeres and telomeres (5Orlando V. Paro R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 6Karpen G.H. Allshire R.C. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 489-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Covalent modifications of histones within the nucleosomes control many aspects of chromatin function. Modification of histones by acetylation is a dynamic process that is associated with the regulation of gene expression. Histones can be acetylated on multiple lysine residues and their steady-state balance is brought about by the opposing catalytic activities of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (7Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Acetylation and deacetylation of lysine residues on histones are respectively linked to transcriptional activation or repression. Enzymes responsible for acetylation of histones at different residues were initially characterized as transcriptional co-activators and later as enzymes. For the most part, the histone acetylation pattern is associated with transcriptionally active genes. However, there are some exceptions to this rule on some residues (9Wang A. Kurdistani S.K. Grunstein M. Science. 2002; 298: 1412-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Lysine 56 of histone H3 (H3K56), 2The abbreviations used are: H3K56, lysine 56 of histone H3; GPS, global proteomic screen; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; Pol II, polymerase II; HU, hydroxyurea; CPT, camptothecin; ORF, open reading frame. 2The abbreviations used are: H3K56, lysine 56 of histone H3; GPS, global proteomic screen; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; Pol II, polymerase II; HU, hydroxyurea; CPT, camptothecin; ORF, open reading frame. which is located in the globular domain where it extends toward the DNA major groove at the entry exit point of the DNA superhelix as it wraps around the nucleosome, is acetylated (10Xu F. Zhang K. Grunstein M. Cell. 2005; 121: 375-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 11Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Previously, it was reported that Spt10 is a putative acetyltransferase to be required for cell cycle specific acetylation at histone genes (10Xu F. Zhang K. Grunstein M. Cell. 2005; 121: 375-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). To better learn about the molecular mechanism of H3K56 acetylation, we took advantage of our global proteomic screen (GPS) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (12Schneider J. Dover J. Johnston M. Shilatifard A. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 377: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Employing GPS, we have demonstrated that several factors including the histone chaperone protein, Asf1 as well as a protein of unknown function, Rtt109, are required for global H3K56 acetylation both from bulk histone and also on chromatin. Although it was demonstrated via chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies that Spt10 is required for proper cell cycle-specific H3K56 acetylation at histone genes (10Xu F. Zhang K. Grunstein M. Cell. 2005; 121: 375-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), our data indicate that this putative histone acetyltransferase is dispensable for global acetylation of H3K56. Our biochemical and molecular analyses have demonstrated that H3K56 acetylation is associated with actively transcribed genes. Rtt109 appears to be directly involved in the regulation of H3K56 acetylation as is enriched with elongating form of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) on chromatin. We also show that the association of H3K56 acetylation as a mark of the elongating form of Pol II is conserved in Drosophila melanogaster. All together, our report demonstrates that Rtt109 associates with transcriptionally active genes and is required for proper H3K56 acetylation. GPS for the Identification of Factors Required for Proper H3K56 Acetylation—GPS analyses were performed as described previously (12Schneider J. Dover J. Johnston M. Shilatifard A. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 377: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). GPS was carried out using antibodies specific for H3K56 acetylation (Upstate Biotechnology). Growth Sensitivity Assays—Cells were grown in a 5-ml YPD (yeast extract containing peptone plus 2% dextrose) culture and then diluted to a starting A600 of 0.1. 10-fold serial dilutions of each culture were made and spotted onto YPD plates containing or lacking either 0.1 m hydroxyurea (HU) or 20 μm CPT. Cells were allowed to grow for 48–72 h at 30 °C. The H3K56Q strain was a generous gift from Dr. Paul D. Kaufman, which was used in their previous study (15Recht J. Tsubota T. Tanny J.C. Diaz R.L. Berger J.M. Zhang X. Garcia B.A. Shabanowitz J. Burlingame A.L. Hunt D.F. Kaufman P.D. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6988-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). ChIP Assays—Formaldehyde-based in vivo cross-linking and ChIP assay was performed as described previously (13Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For the analysis of Rtt109 recruitment at the PHO84, ADH1, GAL1, and RPS5 genes, we modified the above ChIP protocol as follows. 800 μl of lysate was prepared from 100 ml of yeast culture. 200 μl of lysate was used for each immunoprecipitation (using 50 μl of IgG-Sepharose or Sepharose beads from GE Healthcare), and the immunoprecipitated DNA sample was dissolved in 10 μl of Tris-EDTA of which 1 μl was used in PCR analysis. In parallel, the PCR for “input” DNA was performed using 1 μl of DNA that was prepared by dissolving purified DNA from 5 μl of lysate in 100 μl of Tris-EDTA. Immunostaining of Drosophila Polytene Chromosomes—Chromosomes were dissected from third instar wild-type larvae in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (130 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.4 mm KH2PO4) and fixed in fixing buffer before squashing following methods described by Silver and Elgin (14Silver L.M. Elgin S.C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Chromosomal squashes were stained using H3K56 polyclonal antibodies (Upsate Biotechnology) at 1:100 dilution. Chromosome images were obtained using a Leica DM 5000 microscope operated with FW 4000 software. Loss of Yeast ASF1 and RTT109 Alters Global Histone H3 Lysine 56 Acetylation Levels—GPS surveying the entire nonessential yeast gene deletion consortium was used to seek out genes affecting global H3K56 acetylation (12Schneider J. Dover J. Johnston M. Shilatifard A. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 377: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Using antibodies directed against acetylated H3K56, both Asf1 and Rtt109 were identified to be required for H3K56 acetylation (Fig. 1, A–C). Indeed, when H3K56 acetylation from bulk histone is measured in ASF1 and RTT109 deletion strains, it appears that global H3K56 acetylation levels are reduced similar to that of K56Q point mutants (Fig. 1D). Although Spt10 was reported to be required for cell cycle-specific H3K56 acetylation at histone genes (10Xu F. Zhang K. Grunstein M. Cell. 2005; 121: 375-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), our data indicate that the loss of Spt10 does not alter global levels of H3K56 acetylation. This indicates that perhaps other histone acetyltransferases may function in proper global H3K56 acetylation. To support a role for Rtt109 in H3K56 acetylation, our data indicate that RTT109 and K56Q mutant behave similarly in the loss of acetylated H3K56 (Fig. 1D). Indeed, to determine that the loss of Rtt109 is the cause for the defect in H3K56 acetylation in our rtt109 deletion strain, we demonstrated that the introduction of a RTT109 gene in this strain can complement the loss of H3K56 acetylation (Fig. 2A). Cells Deleted for RTT109 Exhibit Sensitivity to HU and CPT Similar to That of asf1Δ or K56Q Mutants—Recently, it was demonstrated that strains deleted for ASF1 or strains bearing a mutation in H3K56 demonstrated an extended doubling time in liquid YPD and presented growth sensitivity to drugs that most significantly effect the S phase such as HU and CPT (10Xu F. Zhang K. Grunstein M. Cell. 2005; 121: 375-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 11Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 15Recht J. Tsubota T. Tanny J.C. Diaz R.L. Berger J.M. Zhang X. Garcia B.A. Shabanowitz J. Burlingame A.L. Hunt D.F. Kaufman P.D. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6988-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We therefore tested a role of Rtt109 for growth on such agents. Our data indicate that strains deleted for asf1, rtt109, or the K56Q mutation are defective for growth on HU and CPT (Fig. 2B). This information suggests that similar to Asf1, Rtt109 may play a role in either the modification or deposition of Lys56-acetylated H3 onto chromatin during the S phase, and that Rtt109 maybe crucial for genome stability during replication. However, a role for this modification during the process of transcription has not been clarified. H3K56 Acetylation Is Associated with Actively Transcribed Genes in S. cerevisiae—We next seek to determine whether Lys56 acetylation or Rtt109 are associated with actively transcribed genes and/or required for transcription. Using ChIP, we analyzed the upstream activating sequences, core promoter (Core), open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2) of two housekeeping genes ADH1 and PHO84, and one regulated gene GAL1 for the presence of acetylated H3K56. We first determined the specificity of our antibody in ChIP by using both wild-type and a strain bearing H3K56Q mutation (Fig. 3A). These studies indicate that a single point mutation in H3K56 results in the loss of ChIP signal demonstrating the specificity of the antibody in ChIP. Furthermore, it appears that not only is H3K56 acetylation associated with the promoter regions of the genes tested, it is also found on the body of genes indicating that it might be associated with the elongating form of RNA polymerase II. Since our GPS studies indicated a role for both Asf1 and Rtt109 in proper H3K56 acetylation from bulk histone, we wanted to determine whether these factors are also required for proper H3K56 acetylation associated on chromatin. Indeed, it appears that the loss of either Asf1 or Rtt109 results in the loss of H3K56 acetylation associated with chromatin on all the genes tested in this study (Fig. 3, B and C). To determine a direct role for Rtt109 in H3K56 acetylation on chromatin, we next determined whether this protein is associated on the chromatin of these genes upon transcription. We therefore used a tandem affinity purification Tagged::Rtt109 strain to perform our ChIP studies. As shown in Fig. 4A, Rtt109 is associated with all three genes tested and most importantly, its ChIP signal appears to increase toward the body of the actively transcribed gene. To define whether H3K56 acetylation or Asf1 is required for proper pre-initiation complex formation and initiation of transcription, we analyzed for recruitment of TBP and Pol II to the core promoters and coding sequences of the GAL1, ADH1, and PHO84 genes in the ASF1 wild-type and deletion mutant strains. Our ChIP data demonstrate that recruitment of TBP and Pol II to the core promoters of GAL1, ADH1, and PHO84 was not altered in asf1Δ (data not shown). Thus, H3K56 acetylation does not seem to regulate formation of the preinitiation complex assembly (and hence transcriptional initiation) at the core promoters. Similarly, recruitment of Pol II to the coding sequences of these genes was not changed in the ASF1 deletion mutant strain (data not shown), thus suggesting H3K56 is not required for overall association of Pol II with the coding regions; however, it is not clear at this time whether the overall rate of transcription is altered in the absence of H3K56 acetylation. However, it is clear that H3K56 acetylation is associated on the ORFs of actively transcribed genes in S. cerevisiae. H3K56 Acetylation Is Associated with Some of the Transcriptionally Active Puff Sites on Polytene Chromosome of Drosophila—Our studies in yeast S. cerevisiae indicate that H3K56 acetylation appears to be a mark associated with actively transcribed genes, and it co-localizes with the elongating from of Pol II. Therefore, we wanted to determine whether this mark is also found on actively transcribed genes in metazoans. Using H3K56 antisera, we performed immunolocalization studies to determine the distribution pattern of this histone modification on the third instar larval polytene chromosomes of Drosophila. H3K56 acetylation appears to be widely distributed throughout polytene chromosomes and is concentrated at some of the loci that are transcriptionally active, i.e. transcriptional puff sites (Fig. 4B). Our previous studies have demonstrated that elongating form of Pol II, which is phosphorylated on its conserved COOH-terminal domain, is also associated at such transcriptionally active puff sites (16Gerber M. Ma J. Dean K. Eissenberg J.C. Shilatifard A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6104-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Tenney K. Gerber M. Ilvarsonn A. Schneider J. Gause M. Dorsett D. Eissenberg J.C.

The dynamic process of the addition and removal of acetyl moiety on histone tails are linked to transcriptional activation or repression. Recently, Workman and colleagues (19Carozza M.J. Li B.

They identified two Rpd3 complexes, Rpd3L (1.2 MDa) and RpdS (0.6 MDa). While the subunits of RpdL were consistent with the promoter-recruited co-repressor model previously shown, Rpd3S revealed two unique subunits, Rco1 and Eaf3. Their studies demonstrated that histone methylation within the body of actively transcribed genes, by Set2, can be used as a mark for the recruitment of the RpdS complex via Eaf3 to erase transcription elongation-associated acetylation and to suppress intragenic transcription initiation (19Carozza M.J. Li B. Florens L Saganuma T Swanson S.K. Lee K.K. Shia W.J. Anderson S. Yates J. Washburn M.P. Workman J.L.

This study has demonstrated the biological significance of elongation-associated histone acetylation and deacetylation in proper regulation of gene expression. In this manuscript, we have demonstrated that: 1) Rtt109 and Asf1 are required for a proper pattern of H3K56 acetylation, analyzed from bulk histone; 2) RTT109 deletion exhibits sensitivity to DNA damaging agents similar to that of asf1Δ and the H3K56Q mutants; 3) H3K56 acetylation and Rtt109 appears to be associated on the body of actively transcribed genes in yeast; 4) H3K56 acetylation also appears to be associated on active transcriptional puff sites in Drosophila. Together, these observations suggest a direct role for Rtt109 in proper H3K56 acetylation and its association on the body of actively transcribed genes. Given the above information several mechanisms for the role of Rtt109 in H3K56 acetylation can be proposed. First, similar to Asf1, Rtt109 may play a role as a histone chaperone and be required for deposition of already Lys56-acetylated H3 into chromatin in the wake of the transcribing polymerase. A second probable mechanism for the role of Rtt109 in H3K56 acetylation could be explained by the ability of this protein to directly modify H3K56. In support of this model, we do observe association of Rtt109 with the transcribing Pol II. As mentioned above, histone acetylation/deacetylation associated with elongating from of RNA polymerase II can play a major role in the regulation of transcriptional initiation from intragenic transcription initiation sites. It is not clear at this time whether H3K56 acetylation and its deacetylation are also required for intragenic transcription initiation. However, future studies in this regard should be very informative."

The expression of ghrelin is not limited to the stomach. The duodenum also produces large amounts of ghrelin, and it is also expressed at lower levels in other tissues, such as pancreas, brain, liver, and lung, (14Hosoda H. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Similar to many other peptide hormones, ghrelin is processed from a 94-amino-acid precursor. Octanoylation at a serine residue (Ser-3) is necessary for its action via the growth hormone secretagogue receptor, although the desoctanoyl peptide may have alternative functions (15Ariyasu H. Takaya K. Iwakura H. Hosoda H. Akamizu T. Arai Y. Kangawa K. Nakao K. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent research has revealed another bioactive peptide named obestatin within the ghrelin precursor (16Zhang J.V. Ren P.G. Avsian-Kretchmer O. Luo C.W. Rauch R. Klein C. Hsueh A.J.W. Science. 2005; 310: 996-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Obestatin is a 23-amino-acid peptide and is a cognate ligand for receptor GPR39, which is a member of a ghrelin receptor subfamily (17McKee K.K. Tan C.P. Palyha O.C. Liu J. Feighner S.D. Hreniuk D.L.

Although derived from the same precursor, in contrast to the effects of ghrelin, obestatin suppresses food intake, inhibits intestinal activity, and decreases weight gain (16Zhang J.V. Ren P.G. Avsian-Kretchmer O. Luo C.W. Rauch R. Klein C. Hsueh A.J.W. Science. 2005; 310: 996-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). It is well established that many bioactive peptide hormones are generated by limited proteolytic processing by members of a secretory pathway-specialized serine protease family related to yeast Kex2 (the subtilisin-like prohormone convertase family SPCs or PCs), which includes PC1/3, PC2, and PC5/6A (19Rouillé Y.

Much data has accumulated over the past few years on functional aspects of ghrelin. However, biosynthetic studies have been lacking. In this report, we investigate the processing of proghrelin in various prohormone convertase-deficient mouse models available in our laboratory. Animals—Mice used in this study were all on the C57BL/6J genetic background. They were maintained under controlled temperature (21-23 °C) and lighting conditions (lights on 7:00 a.m.-7:00 p.m.) with free access to food and water. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health as well as University of Chicago guidelines. PC1/3 and PC2 null mice were created as described previously (21Zhu X. Zhou A. Dey A. Norrbom C. Carroll R. Zhang C. Laurent V. Lindberg I. Ugelholdt R. Holst J. Steiner D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Exon23A encodes a 38-amino-acid C-terminal tail that targets PC5A into secretory granules (23De Bie I. Marcinkiewicz M. Malide D. Lazure C. Nakayama K. Bendayan M. Seidah N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1261-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Peptide Extraction—Peptides were extracted following the procedure described by Kojima et al. (1Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7261) Google Scholar). Briefly, four-month-old mouse stomachs (∼200 mg) were dissected free and opened to remove their contents. They were rinsed with double-distilled water and then boiled for 10 min in 1 ml of double-distilled water to inactivate proteases. The stomachs were then minced, the resulting suspensions adjusted to a final concentration of 1 m acetic acid and 20 mm HCl, and homogenized with a polytron. The mixtures were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were collected and the volume reduced to 0.3 ml using a Speedvac before being precipitated by the addition of 0.6 ml of acetone. The precipitates were removed by centrifugation at 13,000 revolutions/min for 10 min and the supernatants dried in vacuo for Western blot analysis. Western Blot—The dried stomach extracts (∼10 μg of protein) were resuspended in 30 μl of water and 60 μl of tricine sample buffer. The mixture was boiled for 5 min before 30 μl of each was loaded onto a 20% tris-glycine gel. The gel was then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane overnight at 24 volts using glycine buffer in the presence of 20% methanol. The purified antighrelin IgG was a gift from Roy Smith, which was raised against octanoyl-ghrelin (24Sun Y. Ahmed S. Smith R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7973-7981Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The second antibody was NA934V, ECL anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase-linked. Immunocytochemistry—Stomachs were harvested and embedded in OCT (catalog number 4583, Sakura Finetek USA, Inc., Torrance, CA) and frozen under -20 °C 2-methylbutane for 20 min. Thin sections with a thickness of 5 μm were produced with a cryomicrotome. They were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature followed by three washes of phosphate-buffered saline. The sections were treated with 10% normal donkey serum in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.01% Triton X-100. For ghrelin staining, 1 μg of anti-ghrelin IgG was conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The conjugated IgG was then diluted into 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and used for staining. For PC1/3 staining, the sections were treated with PC1/3 antibody (1:600 dilution, a gift from Iris Lindberg) followed by treatment with donkey anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated Alexa594 (1:100 dilution, Molecular Probes). The sections were examined with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51). Northern Blot—Fresh mouse stomach was rinsed and minced before it was homogenized in 5 volumes (∼1 ml) of cold TRIzol (Invitrogen) with a polytron and then centrifuged at 13,000 revolutions/min using a table top microcentrifuge for 15 min. Two hundred microliters of chloroform were added to the supernatant and mixed by vortexing and then centrifuged at 13,000 revolutions/min, again to collect the supernatant. RNA was precipitated by adding an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol. The pellet was washed once with 80% ethanol. RNA was resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate water, and the concentration was estimated by A260. Samples (100 μg each) were loaded onto a 1.3% agarose gel containing 10% formaldehyde. After electrophoresis (5 V/cm, 3 h), the RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Ambion, catalog number 1940). The RNA probe was labeled with P-32 by transcribing ghrelin cDNA with a T7 promoter. The membrane was washed and exposed to a phosphorimaging device, and the intensity of each band was quantified and expressed as arbitrary units. Ghrelin Is Not Processed in PC1/3 Null Mouse Stomach—Ghrelin was derived from a 94-amino-acid proprotein (Fig. 1). To test whether PC1/3 is involved in this process, we analyzed ghrelin processing in PC1/3 null mouse stomachs. Stomachs from two PC1/3 null and two wild-type four-month-old mice were extracted, resolved, and Western blotted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results (Fig. 2A) show that a band of 3.2 kDa corresponding in size to mature ghrelin is present in wild-type samples. However, in the PC1/3 null stomach samples, there is no detectable 3.2 kDa band, even after extended exposure. However, a band of 11 kDa corresponding to the predicted size of the precursor is present in the PC1/3 null samples. To verify the identity of this 11-kDa band, PC1/3 null mouse stomach extract was immunoprecipitated with ghrelin antibody before it was resolved by SDS-PAGE. The 11-kDa band was then excised and the protein extracted by electroelution. The sample was then subjected to mass spectrometric analysis using the linear positive ion mode with a proteomics analyzer (Applied Biosystems, 4700). A peak with a mass of 10,836 Da (Fig. 2B) corresponding to the predicted mass of octanoylated proghrelin (10,832 Da) was observed, confirming the identity of the 11-kDa band. The results thus strongly indicate that PC1/3 is the convertase responsible for the processing of ghrelin from proghrelin in vivo.FIGURE 2Proghrelin is not processed in the PC1/3 null stomach.

B, mass spectrometric trace of the 11-kDa band recovered from the gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ghrelin Is Co-localized with PC1/3 in Mouse Stomach—To examine the ghrelin expression pattern in relation to that of PC1/3 in stomach, we cryosectioned wild-type stomachs and immunostained sections with both ghrelin antibody and PC1/3 antibody. The ghrelin antibody was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488, and PC1/3 antibody was labeled with Alexa 594. These labels are fluorogenic, and when excited appropriately during microscopy, the ghrelin will appear as a green signal, and PC1/3 will be red. Fig. 3A shows the distribution of ghrelin immunoreactivity, and Fig. 3B illustrates the pattern of PC1/3 expression in the stomach. Merging of these images demonstrates that the expression of ghrelin parallels the expression of PC1/3 (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that ghrelin is co-localized with PC1/3 in the ghrelin-producing cells of the stomach. Ghrelin Processing Is Not Altered in PC2 and PC5A Mouse Stomach—To further determine whether PC2 or PC5/6A may affect ghrelin processing, we analyzed stomach extracts from PC2 or PC5/6A nulls by Western blot. The results (Fig. 4) show that a band corresponding to mature ghrelin is present in both PC2 and PC5/6A null stomach extracts, and there is no proghrelin detectable, even after extended exposure. These results indicate that PC2 and PC5/6a are not involved in the processing of proghrelin to ghrelin in this tissue. Ghrelin mRNA Level Is Elevated in PC1 Null Mice—Of the various peptide hormones normally processed by PC1/3 in vivo, such as proopiomelanocortin and growth hormone-releasing hormone, we noticed that, in earlier studies of PC1/3 null animals, their expression was up-regulated (20Zhou A. Webb G. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20745-20748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). To determine whether ghrelin expression is also up-regulated in PC1/3 null mice, total gastric RNA was extracted from two animals at 4 months of age and analyzed by Northern blotting (Fig. 5A). Fig. 5B shows a quantitative analysis of the Northern blot after normalization for loading using GAPDH. The results indicate that ghrelin mRNA level is elevated by ∼40% in the PC1/3 null mouse stomach. Ghrelin is processed from a 94-amino-acid precursor through limited proteolytic cleavage at a single arginine. In this report, we have demonstrated that prohormone convertase 1/3 is the enzyme responsible for this event in vivo. Western blot results indicated that, in our PC1/3 null mice, only intact full-length precursor (proghrelin) is present in stomach extracts. This finding was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemical data also confirm that PC1/3 is co-localized with ghrelin in gastric ghrelin-positive cells. These three lines of evidence all support the conclusion that PC1/3 is the only convertase responsible for post-translational processing of proghrelin to ghrelin in the stomach. The presence of a proline preceding the C-terminal arginine provides an explanation for the lack of further processing by carboxypeptidase E-like carboxypeptidases (19Rouillé Y. Duguay S. Lund K. Furuta M. Gong Q. Lipkind G. Oliva Jr., A. Chan S. Steiner D. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 16: 322-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Our results also indicate that post-translational acylation, i.e. the addition of an 8 (or 10) carbon fatty acid to the peptide occurs independently of proteolytic processing; that is, the octanoylation of ghrelin does not require prior processing of the peptide, as indicated by our mass spectrometric results, which show that the proghrelin in the PC1/3 null stomach is acylated. In the mass spectrometric analysis, a second peak with a molecular mass of 10,868 Da was also present. We speculate that this could represent decanoyl- or decenoyl-proghrelin or a combination of these two forms (25Hosoda H. Kojima M. Mizushima T. Shimizu S. Kangawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 64-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Our results also suggest that it is highly likely that PC1/3 is involved in the processing of obestatin as well, as we detected only the full-length precursor but not any intermediate products in PC1/3 nulls. Thus, either PC1/3 is capable of cleaving at the single Arg sites Arg-52 and -74 (Fig. 1) to generate obestatin or prior cleavage at Arg-28 is required to expose these processing sites for other convertase(s) when obestatin is produced in the same cells. We cannot rule out the possibility that obestatin is processed from nonacylated proghrelin in other stomach cells. Of the convertases normally present in neuroendocrine secretory granules, only PC1/3, PC2, and PC5/6A appear to be functionally significant. Our studies showing that PC1/3 is the only enzyme involved in the processing of ghrelin in vivo is consistent with in vitro data showing that PC1/3 is able to cleave bacterially produced recombinant proghrelin, whereas PC2 is not. 3I. Lindberg, personal communication. Although the favored cleavage site for PC1/3 is at paired basic amino acid residues (Lys-Arg or Arg-Arg), it is also capable of cleaving after single basic residues, such as in the processing of proglucagon to GLP-1 (26Ugleholdt R. Zhu X. Deacon C.F. Orskov C. Steiner D.F. Holst J.J. Endocrinology. 2003; 145: 1349-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), pro-CCK to CCK8, CCK58, and at the neurophysin-glycopeptide junction of provasopressin (27Cameron A. Apletalina E.V. Lindberg I. Dalbey R.E. Sigman D.S. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York2002: 291-332Google Scholar). Here we provide another example of PC1/3 processing at a single Arg, in this case a single Arg preceded by a Pro, which may make it a uniquely favored substrate for PC1/3."
https://openalex.org/W2009139426,"Telomestatin is a potent G-quadruplex ligand that interacts with the 3′ telomeric overhang, leading to its degradation, and induces a delayed senescence and apoptosis of cancer cells. POT1 and TRF2 were recently identified as specific telomere-binding proteins involved in telomere capping and t-loop maintenance and whose interaction with telomeres is modulated by telomestatin. We show here that the treatment of HT1080 human tumor cells by telomestatin induces a rapid decrease of the telomeric G-overhang and of the double-stranded telomeric repeats. Telomestatin treatment also provokes a strong decrease of POT1 and TRF2 from their telomere sites, suggesting that the ligand triggers the uncapping of the telomere ends. The effect of the ligand is associated with an increase of the γ-H2AX foci, one part of them colocalizing at telomeres, thus indicating the occurrence of a DNA damage response at the telomere, but also the presence of additional DNA targets for telomestatin. Interestingly, the expression of GFP-POT1 in HT1080 cells increases both telomere and G-overhang length. As compared with HT1080 cells, HT1080GFP-POT1 cells presented a resistance to telomestatin treatment characterized by a protection to the telomestatin-induced growth inhibition and the G-overhang shortening. This protection is related to the initial G-overhang length rather than to its degradation rate and is overcome by increased telomestatin concentration. Altogether these results suggest that telomestatin induced a telomere dysfunction in which G-overhang length and POT1 level are important factors but also suggest the presence of additional DNA sites of action for the ligand.

Telomeres play an important role in structural chromosome integrity. They cap and protect their extremities from illegitimate recombination, degradation, and end-to-end fusion (1Blackburn E.H. Cell. 2001; 106: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1750) Google Scholar). Telomere replication is sustained in proliferative somatic cells and in most cancer cells by telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein complex that elongates the chromosome ends to compensate losses occurring at each cell division, because of the inability of polymerase to fully replicate telomeric extremities (2McEachern M.J. Krauskopf A. Blackburn E.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 331-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). In somatic cells, the absence of telomerase provokes a progressive shortening of telomeric DNA that ultimately leads to replicative senescence, once a critical telomere length has been reached (3Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 257-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Numerous observations, notably that inhibition of telomerase activity limits tumor cell growth (4Hahn W.C. Counter C.M. Lundberg A.S. Beijersbergen R.L. Brooks M.W. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1999; 400: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar), have led to the proposal that telomere and telomerase are potential targets for cancer chemotherapy (3Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 257-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 5Neidle S. Parkinson G. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar).In human, telomeres consist of the repetition of the G-rich duplex sequence 5′-TTAGGG-3′. A G-rich 3′-strand extends beyond the duplex to form a 130-210-base overhang (G-overhang) (6Makarov V.L. Hirose Y. Langmore J.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 7Wright W.E. Tesmer V.M. Huffman K.E. Levene S.D. Shay J.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2801-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Telomeres may be structurally organized in different conformations together with several telomere-associated proteins, such as TRF1, TRF2, and POT1 (8Smogorzewska A. De Lange T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 177-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The G-overhang is either accessible for telomerase extension in an open state or inaccessible in a capped (or closed) conformation that involves the formation of a putative t-loop structure (8Smogorzewska A. De Lange T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 177-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Although the t-loop structure has not been defined in detail, it may be created by the invasion of the G-overhang into the duplex part of the telomere (9Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). The t-loop structure is induced in vitro by the binding of TRF2 in the vicinity of the telomeric G-overhang (10Stansel R.M. de Lange T. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5532-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar).Telomeric proteins stabilize the telomere by protecting the single-stranded G-overhang from degradation (8Smogorzewska A. De Lange T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 177-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Uncapping of the telomere ends leads to telomeric dysfunction characterized by end-to-end fusion, inappropriate recombination, anaphase bridges, and G-overhang degradation that either lead to apoptosis or senescence (11Blackburn E.H. Chan S. Chang J. Fulton T.B. Krauskopf A. McEachern M. Prescott J. Roy J. Smith C. Wang H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2000; 65: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Karlseder J. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Science. 2002; 295: 2446-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar).A dominant negative mutant of TRF2, TRF2ΔBΔM, displaces TRF2 and its interacting factors off the telomeres and causes a loss of telomeric overhangs, apoptosis, senescence, and chromosome abnormalities (8Smogorzewska A. De Lange T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 177-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). POT1 (protection of telomere 1) binds specifically to the single-stranded G-overhang (14Baumann P. Cech T.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar) and has been described as a regulator of telomere length (15Colgin L.M. Baran K. Baumann P. Cech T.R. Reddel R.R. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 942-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 16Loayza D. de Lange T. Nature. 2003; 25: 1013-1018Crossref Scopus (537) Google Scholar). POT1 has been found associated with the double-stranded telomeric DNA protein TRF1 and TRF2 through the bridging proteins PTOP/TINT1/PIP1 and TIN2 (17de Lange T. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2100-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar). Suppression of POT1 function by RNA interference in human cells leads to the loss of the telomeric single-stranded overhang, induced apoptosis, senescence, and chromosomal instability in human cells (18Veldman T. Etheridge K.T. Counter C.M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 2264-2270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 19Yang Q. Zheng Y.L. Harris C.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1070-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).Because of the repetition of guanines, the G-overhang is prone to form a four-stranded G-quadruplex structure that has been shown to inhibit telomerase activity in vitro (20Zahler A.M. Williamson J.R. Cech T.R. Prescott D.M. Nature. 1991; 350: 718-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Small molecules that stabilize the G-quadruplex are effective as telomerase inhibitors (21Sun D. Thompson B. Cathers B.E. Salazar M. Kerwin S.M. Trent J.O. Jenkins T.C. Neidle S. Hurley L.H. J. Med.

Rangan A. Vankayalapati H. Kim M.Y. Zeng Q. Sun D. Han H. Fedoroff O.Y. Nishioka D. Rha S.Y. Izbicka E. Von Hoff D.D. Hurley L.H. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2001; 1: 103-120PubMed Google Scholar, 29Tauchi T.

Among them, the natural product telomestatin is one of the most active and selective telomeric G-quadruplex ligands (30Rosu F. Gabelica V. Shin-ya K. De Pauw E. Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2003; 21: 2702-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 32Kim M.Y. Vankayalapati H. Shin-Ya K. Wierzba K. Hurley L.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2098-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). We have shown recently that telomestatin impairs the conformation and the length of the telomeric G-overhang, an effect that is thought to be more relevant than double-stranded telomere erosion as a marker for its cellular activity (33Gomez D. Paterski R. Lemarteleur T. Shin-Ya K. Mergny J.L. Riou J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41487-41494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Telomestatin also inhibits POT1 to the telomeric G-overhang in vitro and induces GFP-POT1 dissociation from telomeres in EcR293 cells (34Gomez D. O'Donohue M.F. Wenner T. Douarre C. Macadré J. Koebel P. Giraud-Panis M.J. Kaplan H. Kolkes A. Shin-Ya K. Riou J.F. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6908-6912Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In tumor cells, telomestatin was shown to completely dissociate TRF2 from telomeres, a result thought to be the consequence of the t-loop disruption (35Tahara H. Shin-Ya K. Seimiya H. Yamada H. Tsuruo T. Ide T. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 1955-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar).In this study we have investigated the effect of telomestatin treatment in the tumor cell line HT1080. Our results indicate that G-quadruplex stabilization provokes the rapid degradation of both G-overhang and telomere together with the delocalization of GFP-POT1 and TRF2 from telomeres. DNA damage response is induced by telomestatin, which is partially localized at telomeres. The expression of GFP-POT1 in HT1080 induces the lengthening of the G-overhang and partially protects cells from telomestatin-induced G-overhang degradation and senescence induction. These data confirm the importance of POT1 and G-overhang in the action of telomestatin but suggest the presence of additional DNA sites of action.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOligonucleotides and Compounds—All oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). Telomestatin was purified according to Ref. 31Shin-ya K. Wierzba K. Matsuo K. Ohtani T. Yamada Y. Furihata K. Hayakawa Y. Seto H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 1262-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar. Other compounds were commercially available (Sigma). Telomestatin was prepared at 5 mm in MeOH/Me2SO (50:50). Further dilutions were made in water.Plasmids—Full-length hPOT1 was cloned into the pET22b expression vector by PCR using the Marathon testis cDNA library (Clontech). The cDNA was completely sequenced and corresponded to the sequence previously released (14Baumann P. Cech T.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). This construct contained an N-terminal T7 sequence allowing its coupled transcription/transcription. The GFP-POT1 plasmid was constructed by insertion of the POT1 cDNA after PCR amplification from pET22bPOT1 vector at BamHI-XbaI of the pEGFP-C1 plasmid (Clontech). The ΔOB-POT1 and TRF2 sequences were cloned by PCR from POT1 and TRF2 cDNAs (a gift from E. Gilson, ENS, Lyon, France), using pfu polymerase and inserted in the cloning sites of a pCDNA3 vector.Cell Culture and Transfection—HT1080 was obtained from the ATCC. Cells were grown in DMEM 5The abbreviations used are: DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation. with 100 units of penicillin and 0.1 mg of streptomycin per ml and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). 70-80% confluence cells were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid in Lipofectamine 2000 complex in fetal bovine serum and antibiotic-free DMEM according to the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The media were replaced after 24 h, and the cells were grown in DMEM with 100 units of penicillin and 0.1 mg of streptomycin/ml containing 400 μg/ml of geneticin. After 15 days of geneticin selection, GFP-positive cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorter.For long term cell growth studies, transfected cells were seeded at 15 × 103 cells/ml into a 25-cm2 tissue culture flask, in the presence or the absence of telomestatin (2 μm), cultured for 4 days, then trypsinized, and counted. At each passage, 15 × 103 cells/ml were replated into a new culture flask with fresh medium containing drug solution. Results were expressed as the cumulated population doubling as a function of the time of culture as described previously (36Gomez D. Aouali N. Renaud A. Douarre C. Shin-Ya K. Tazi J. Martinez S. Trentesaux C. Morjani H. Riou J.F. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6149-6153PubMed Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence—For immunofluorescence microscopy, HT1080-GFP-POT1 cells plated on glass coverslips were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde. Cells were then washed twice in PBS and treated with permeabilization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose, and 0.5% Triton X-100), washed twice with PBS followed by antibody staining with 1 ng/μl TRF2 4A794 mouse monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or TRF2 H-300 (sc-9142) rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and/or 2 ng/μl antiphospho-γH2AX (Ser-139) (Upstate Biotechnology) in 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS. The nuclear DNA was stained with 1 μm Hoechst. Secondary antibodies raised against mouse were labeled with Alexa 568 (Molecular Probes), and those raised against rabbit were labeled with Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes).We obtained images of fixed cells using a 100× (NA 1.4) plan apochromat objective mounted on a piezo translator (Physik Instrumente, Karlsruhe, Germany) and imaged with a Cool-snap HQ camera controlled by Metamorph software (Roper Scientific, Duluth, GA). Appropriate excitation and emission filters placed in two filter wheels driven by a Lambda 10-2 controller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) were combined to specific double or triple band dichroic filters (Chroma Technology, Rockingham, VT). Stacks of 60-100 images (12-bit grayscale) were acquired with a z-step of 0.12 μm with a low illumination intensity to avoid photo-bleaching. For data processing, experimental point spread functions were obtained from infra-resolution fluorescent microspheres emitting at specific wavelengths (Molecular Probes), whose stacks were acquired in the same sampling conditions as those used for the volumes to be analyzed. Deconvolution was performed with Metamorph software on a 2.4-GHz Dell computer equipped with a GeForce4 Ti 4800 Se Winfast A280 video card (Leadtek Research Inc., Almere, The Netherlands).G-overhang Assays—The nondenaturing hybridization assay to detect the 3′ telomere G-overhang was performed as described previously on 2.5-μg aliquots of undigested genomic DNA using a labeled 5′-CCCTAACCCTAACCCTAACCC-3′ oligonucleotide (21C) (33Gomez D. Paterski R. Lemarteleur T. Shin-Ya K. Mergny J.L. Riou J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41487-41494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The procedure allows detection of the amount of single strand overhang available for hybridization. Experiments were performed either on genomic DNA from treated cells or on purified genomic DNA treated in vitro with telomestatin, as indicated in the text.TRF Analysis—Aliquots of 5 μg of undigested genomic DNA were hybridized at 37 °C overnight with 0.5 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP-labeled (5′-(CCCTAA)3CCC-3′) oligonucleotide in hybridization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of RsaI and HinfI restriction enzymes in a volume of 20 μl. Reaction was stopped with 2 μl of 1%SDS, 1 mg/ml proteinase K and incubated for 30 min at 50 °C. Hybridized samples were size-fractionated on 0.8% agarose gels in 1× TBE buffer. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide, washed, and dried on Whatman filter paper. Ethidium fluorescence and radioactivity were scanned in a PhosphorImager (Typhoon 9210, Amersham Biosciences). Telomeric smears were revealed by exposure in a PhosphorImager (Typhoon 9210, Amersham Biosciences), and the mean length of the TRF corresponds to the peak of the integration curve from three separate experiments.Chromatin Immunoprecipitations (ChIP)—ChIP was performed according to the manufacturer's procedure (Upstate Biotechnology) using TRF2 antibody (H-300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Telomeric sequences in immunoprecipitates were evidenced by PCR amplification according to a method described previously (37Cawthon R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e47Crossref PubMed Scopus (2471) Google Scholar). The final telomere primer concentrations were 270 nm (tel1) and 900 nm (tel2), and PCR amplification was subjected to 35 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 54 °C for 2 min. The primer sequences were as follows: tel1 5′-GGTTTTTGAGGGTGAGGGTGAGGGTGAGGGTGAGGGT-3′ and tel25′-TCCCGACTATCCCTATCCCTATCCCTATCCCTATCCCTA-3RESULTSTelomestatin Induces a Decrease of the Telomeric G-overhang in HT1080 Cells—Recent studies have indicated that the telomeric G-overhang represents one of the direct targets of quadruplex ligands (33Gomez D. Paterski R. Lemarteleur T. Shin-Ya K. Mergny J.L. Riou J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41487-41494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 38Douarre C. Gomez D. Morjani H. Zahm J.M. O'Donohue M.F. Eddabra L. Mailliet P. Riou J.F. Trentesaux C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2192-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We analyzed the effect of telomestatin on the telomeric G-overhangs from HT1080 cells. As shown before, hybridization of a telomeric C-rich probe (21C) under nondenaturing conditions allowed the measurement of the relative single-stranded G-overhang signal in undigested genomic DNA samples (33Gomez D. Paterski R. Lemarteleur T. Shin-Ya K. Mergny J.L. Riou J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41487-41494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).Treatment of HT1080 cells with 1, 2, and 5 μm telomestatin for 48 h induces a dose-dependent decrease of the G-overhang signal, which represents 32, 15, and 10% of the untreated control, respectively (Fig. 1, A and C).Previous results with telomestatin in A549 cells (33Gomez D. Paterski R. Lemarteleur T. Shin-Ya K. Mergny J.L. Riou J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41487-41494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) indicate that the apparent decrease in G-overhang signal may result from the stabilization of the quadruplex, making it less prone to hybridization to its complementary C-rich probe. To exclude this possibility, we performed the following experiment: telomestatin (1-5 μm) was added to purified DNA just prior to the hybridization reaction. This results in a nearly complete inhibition of the G-overhang signal (Fig. 1, B and C). The inhibition is almost completely reversed in the presence of another G-quadruplex competitor (Pu22myc) that traps the ligands, leaving the overhang free for hybridization with 21C probe (Fig. 1, B and C).To determine the real degradation of the G-overhang induced by telomestatin in HT1080 cells, in this study we used the competition with Pu22myc on DNA samples from telomestatin-treated HT1080 cells. Results indicated a limited reversion (∼15%) of the G-overhang signal decrease (Fig. 1, A and C, compare with reactions in the absence of Pu22myc). Therefore, we concluded that the G-overhang signal loss in HT1080-treated cells mainly corresponds to an effective degradation of the telomeric G-overhang in vivo.Treatment with Telomestatin Delocalizes Telomeric POT1 in Human Cell Lines—To examine the effects of telomestatin treatment on the binding of POT1 to telomeres in cultured cells, we have designed a GFP-POT1 vector that was transfected in HT1080 cells. As reported previously (15Colgin L.M. Baran K. Baumann P. Cech T.R. Reddel R.R. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 942-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 34Gomez D. O'Donohue M.F. Wenner T. Douarre C. Macadré J. Koebel P. Giraud-Panis M.J. Kaplan H. Kolkes A. Shin-Ya K. Riou J.F. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6908-6912Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), GFP-POT1 overexpression in telomerase-positive cells results in telomere length elongation (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that the N-terminal fusion with GFP does not alter the functional property of the fusion protein to transduce telomere extension.To localize GFP-POT1 in HT1080 cells, a co-localization experiment has been performed on fixed cells by confocal microscopy using a TRF2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2, GFP-POT1 colocalizes with almost all the TRF2 dots, suggesting that GFP-POT1 protein is present at telomeres in HT1080 cells. Thus, cells expressing GFP-POT1 fusion protein may be used as a model to investigate the effect of telomestatin on POT1 localization. HT1080 cells expressing GFP-POT1 have been treated for 48 h with 2 μm telomestatin (Fig. 2), a concentration and time exposure with the ligand at which most of the cells are still viable, because the IC50 values for 2 and 4 days of treatment were equal to 5 and 1.5 μm, respectively. Microscopic examination of treated cells indicated a dramatic change in the nuclear organization of GFP-POT1. Telomestatin strongly reduced the GFP-POT1 punctated signal associated with telomeres to nearly undetectable levels, as compared with untreated controls (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Telomestatin alters the GFP-POT1 and TRF2 localization at telomeres in HT1080 cells. Effect of telomestatin (2 μm) on GFP-POT1 in HT1080 cells treated for 48 h. Fluorescence for GFP-POT1 (green), TRF2 (red), and Hoechst (blue) was determined on fixed cells. GFP-POT1 and TRF2 signals colocalize in control untreated cells. Telomestatin treatment induces a strong decrease of the telomeric sites of GFP-POT1 fluorescence and also induces a decrease of the TRF2 fluorescence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The dose-dependent effect of telomestatin was also studied in HT1080GFP-POT1 cells after 48 h of treatment (supplemental Fig. S2). At 0.5 μm telomestatin, no obvious decrease or modification of the GFP-POT signal was detectable in >90% of the cells. At 1 μm, a decrease of telomeric GFP-POT1 fluorescence was observed in 20-30% of the cells. The main effect of the ligand, i.e. a decrease of the telomeric GFP-POT1 fluorescence, was detectable at 2 μm in about 50-60% of the cells. In addition, a significant fraction of the cells (25-30%) presented a nucleolar localization of GFP-POT1. At 5 μm, a telomestatin concentration that significantly impaired the growth of the cells and induced apoptosis (supplemental Fig. S3), nearly all surviving cells presented a complete loss of the GFP-POT1 telomeric signal and a strong nucleolar accumulation, as well as a marked cytoplasmic GFP-POT1 accumulation (supplemental Fig. S2).Telomestatin Impairs TRF2 Binding at Telomeres and Decreases Telomere Length in HT1080 Cells—To examine whether the delocalization of POT1 is a consequence of a general effect on the telomere structure, we have determined the effect of telomestatin on TRF2 localization. Telomestatin treatment of HT1080 cells (2 μm, 48 h) induced a noticeable decrease of the TRF2 signal at telomeres (Fig. 2) that paralleled the effect of telomestatin on GFP-POT1.The telomestatin effect was also evaluated by ChIP experiments using TRF2 antibodies. In these experiments, the immunoprecipitated telomere sequences were evaluated by specific PCR amplification, as described previously (37Cawthon R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e47Crossref PubMed Scopus (2471) Google Scholar). ChIP experiments indicate that telomestatin (2 μm, 48 h) provokes the removal of an important fraction of TRF2 from telomeric sequences, in agreement with the immunofluorescence results (supplemental Fig. S4).The effect of the ligand on TRF2 suggests that either the double-stranded telomeric repeats or the t-loop conformations have been altered. We have thus determined the effect of telomestatin to decrease the length of the double-stranded telomere. Interestingly, the exposure of HT1080 cells to telomestatin (2 μm) induces a rapid telomere shortening detectable after short term treatment (supplemental Fig. S5A). The TRF decrease corresponds to 300 and 600 bases after 4 and 8 days, respectively (supplemental Fig. S5B). These results indicate that telomestatin also induces a dramatic and rapid alteration of the double-stranded telomere repeats and TRF2 binding to telomeres in addition to the G-overhang degradation and the GFP-POT1 delocalization.Telomestatin Induces an Early DNA Damage Response at Telomeres—Telomere-initiated senescence or dysfunctional telomeres have been shown to be associated with a DNA damage response involving factors such as 53BP1 and γH2AX (17de Lange T. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2100-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar, 39Celli G.B. de Lange T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 712-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The rapid effect of telomestatin to trigger telomere degradation together with POT1 and TRF2 removal may suggest the induction of a DNA damage response at telomeres. To study such DNA damage, we used γH2AX immunofluorescence after short term treatment with the ligand. As shown in Fig. 3A, telomestatin treatment induces a marked DNA damage response evidenced by a strong increase in the γH2AX foci. The effect started at 0.5 μm telomestatin and reaches nearly all cells in the presence of 2 μm telomestatin (Fig. 3, A and B). We have also determined the colocalization of γH2AX foci in HT1080GFP-POT1 with telomeric GFP-POT1 under telomestatin treatment. As shown in Fig. 3B, treatment with telomestatin 0.5 μm mainly triggers a DNA damage response outside from the telomeric foci. Only a fraction of the total γH2AX foci colocalizes with GFP-POT1 in treated cells (indicated by arrowheads in Fig. 3B). The γH2AX and GFP-POT1 colocalization is significantly increased by 2.5-fold (p < 0.01), as compared with controls, in cells treated with 0.5, 1, or 2 μm telomestatin, where the GFP-POT1 telomeric signal is still detectable (Fig. 3C). However, in cells treated with 5 μm telomestatin, the analysis was not possible, because of the complete delocalization of the GFP-POT1 protein (see supplemental Fig. S2). These results have been confirmed by Telo-fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments using a telomeric fluorescein isothiocyanate-peptidic nucleic acid probe to determine the localization of γH2AX foci in telomestatin-treated HT1080 cells (supplemental Fig. S6). Analysis of HT1080 cells treated with telomestatin also showed that in some metaphases the γH2AX response is observed at the extremities of chromosomes, in agreement with a response at telomeres (Fig. 3D).FIGURE 3DNA damage response at telomere after telomestatin treatment in HT1080 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2111898206,"We characterized the molecular mechanisms by which high density lipoprotein (HDL) inhibits the expression of adhesion molecules, including vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1, induced by sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α in endothelial cells. HDL inhibited S1P-induced nuclear factor κB activation and adhesion molecule expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The inhibitory HDL actions were associated with nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) activation and were reversed by inhibitors for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and NOS. The HDL-induced inhibitory actions were also attenuated by the down-regulation of scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) and its associated protein PDZK1. When TNFα was used as a stimulant, the HDL-induced NOS activation and the inhibitory action on adhesion molecule expression were, in part, attenuated by the down-regulation of the expression of S1P receptors, especially S1P1, in addition to SR-BI. Reconstituted HDL composed mainly of apolipoprotein A-I and phosphatidylcholine mimicked the SR-BI-sensitive part of HDL-induced actions. Down-regulation of S1P3 receptors severely suppressed the stimulatory actions of S1P. Although Gi/o proteins may play roles in either stimulatory or inhibitory S1P actions, as judged from pertussis toxin sensitivity, the coupling of S1P3 receptors to G12/13 proteins may be critical to distinguish the stimulatory pathways from the inhibitory ones. In conclusion, even though S1P alone stimulates adhesion molecule expression, HDL overcomes S1P3 receptor-mediated stimulatory actions through SR-BI/PDZK1-mediated signaling pathways involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and NOS. In addition, the S1P component of HDL plays a role in the inhibition of TNFα-induced actions through S1P receptors, especially S1P1.

Am. J. Cardiol. 2003; 92: 42J-49JAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 2Assmann G. Gotto Jr., A.M. Circulation. 2004; 109: 8-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HDL can remove excess cholesterol from arterial and nonliver cells, transport it to the liver, and excrete it as bile acids. The so-called reverse cholesterol transport is thought to be an important anti-atherogenic action of HDL (1Rader D.J. Am. J. Cardiol. 2003; 92: 42J-49JAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 2Assmann G. Gotto Jr., A.M. Circulation. 2004; 109: 8-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In recent studies, however, HDL has been shown to exert a variety of actions that are independent of cholesterol metabolism. For example, HDL inhibits LDL oxidation, smooth muscle cell migration, platelet aggregation, and endothelial dysfunction (3O'Connell B.J. Genest Jr., J. Circulation. 2001; 104: 1978-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 4Rohrer L. von Hersberger M. Eckardstein A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2004; 15: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The inhibition of endothelial dysfunction may be achieved by several responses to HDL, including the stimulation of proliferation, cell survival, migration, and NO synthesis, or the inhibition of apoptosis and of the expression of adhesion molecules, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (3O'Connell B.J. Genest Jr., J. Circulation. 2001; 104: 1978-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 5Collins T. Cybulsky M.I. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). An increase in the expression of the adhesion molecules stimulates monocyte interaction with endothelial cells and cell penetration into subendothelial space or the intima of arterial walls. Thus, the expression of adhesion molecules is thought to be one of the early steps in the onset of atherosclerosis (3O'Connell B.J. Genest Jr., J. Circulation. 2001; 104: 1978-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 5Collins T. Cybulsky M.I. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms whereby HDL inhibits adhesion molecule expression are poorly defined.We have recently shown that S1P is accumulated in lipoprotein fractions, especially HDL fractions (6Okajima F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 9Kimura T. Sato K. Kuwabara A. Tomura H. Ishiwara M. Kobayashi I. Ui M. Okajima F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31780-31785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and demonstrated that HDL-induced cell survival and migration responses are mediated by S1P and its receptors, S1P1 and S1P3 (9Kimura T.

Other groups also have demonstrated that the S1P3 receptor mediates HDL-induced relaxation through NO synthase (NOS) activation and NO synthesis in mouse artery (11van der Nofer J.R. Giet M. Tolle M. von Wnuck Wolinska I. Lipinskiqq K. Baba H.A. Tietge U.J. Godecke A. Ishii I. Kleuser B. Schafers M. Fobker M. Zidek W. Assmann G. Chun J. Levkau B. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 569-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Thus, we proposed the S1P component of HDL as an anti-atherogenic mediator (6Okajima F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 7Tamama K. Okajima F. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2002; 13: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 10Kimura T. Sato K.

However, S1P action on adhesion molecule expression is not simple; S1P alone stimulates the expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 through NF-κB activation (12Xia P. Gamble J.R. Rye K.A. Wang L. Hii C.S. Cockerill P. Khew-Goodall Y. Bert A.G. Barter P.J. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14196-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 15Kimura T. Tomura H. Mogi C.

Shibasawa K. Sato K. Ohwada S. Im D.S. Kurose H. Ishizuka T. Murakami M. Okajima F. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Bolick D.T. Srinivasan S. Kim K.W.

Biol. 2005; 25: 976-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These results suggest that both S1P and HDL have opposing potentials for atherogenesis. The inhibitory action of HDL on adhesion molecule expression could be explained by the S1P component of HDL; however, a previous study (17Xia P. Vadas M.A. Rye K.A. Barter P.J. Gamble J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33143-33147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and our preliminary study did not show any stimulatory effect on adhesion molecule expression by HDL alone. More interestingly, the S1P-induced stimulatory action was lost in the presence of HDL, suggesting that HDL may have mechanisms in addition to those mediated by S1P to inhibit adhesion molecule expression. In the present study, we characterized the molecular mechanisms involved in the HDL-induced inhibitory action and found a critical role of scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) and its associated protein, termed PDZK1, which contains four PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domains (18Nakamura T. Shibata N. Nishimoto-Shibata T. Feng D. Ikemoto M. Motojima K. Iso O.N. Tsukamoto K. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, as expected, we demonstrated the involvement of S1P receptors, in addition to SR-BI, in the HDL-induced inhibition of adhesion molecule expression when TNFα was used as a pro-atherogenic stimulant.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—S1P was purchased from Cayman Chemical Co.; wortmannin was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem; l-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester hydrochloride (l-NAME), and d-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester hydrochloride (d-NAME) were from BIOMOL Research Laboratories Inc.; anti-endothelial nitricoxide synthase (eNOS) antibody, anti-Ser(P)1177 eNOS antibody, and anti-β-actin antibody were from Cell Signaling Technology Inc.; primary mouse antibodies for VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 were from Chemicon International; and anti-SR-BI and anti-PDZK1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. YM-254890 was generously provided by Dr. Masatoshi Taniguchi of Astellas Co. (Tsukuba, Japan). The sources of all other reagents were the same as described previously (15Kimura T. Tomura H. Mogi C. Kuwabara A. Ishiwara M. Shibasawa K. Sato K. Ohwada S. Im D.S. Kurose H. Ishizuka T. Murakami M. Okajima F. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Kimura T.

Plasma lipoproteins were prepared by density gradient centrifugation; LDL (1.019–1.063 g/ml) and HDL (1.063–1.21 g/ml) were separated from freshly isolated plasma of healthy volunteers by sequential ultracentrifugation as described previously (8Murata N. Sato K. Kon J. Tomura H. Yanagita M. Kuwabara A. Ui M. Okajima F. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used HDL isolated from nine different donors; the protein content was estimated to be 1.92 ± 0.12 mg proteins (mainly apolipoprotein A-I)/ml plasma, and S1P content (21Murata N. Sato K. Kon J. Tomura H. Okajima F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 282: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) was 204 ± 10 pmol/mg protein (within the range from 168 to 248 pmol/mg protein). Thus, S1P content in HDL samples is rather constant. We usually used HDL at 1 mg/ml, which corresponds to ∼0.2 μm S1P.Preparation of Reconstituted HDL—The reconstituted discoidal lipoprotein particle (rHDL) was prepared as follows. HDL was delipidated as described (22Osborne J Jr C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and then the lipid-free apolipoprotein mixture was dialyzed against 5 × 1 liter Tris-buffered saline (0.01 m Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01% (w/v) EDTA, and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3). The discoidal lipoprotein particle was prepared by the sodium cholate dialysis method as previously described (23Jonas A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 553-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), using apolipoprotein/palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine molar ratios of 1:80 (24Assanasen C. Mineo C. Seetharam D. Yuhanna I.S. Marcel Y.L. Connelly M.A. de la Williams D.L. Llera-Moya M. Shaul P.W. Silver D.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The rHDL samples thus prepared were diluted to roughly 50% with respect to protein content compared with native HDL samples. To avoid the loss of protein, we used the rHDL samples without further concentration. Thus, in the experiments using rHDL, we used 500 μg/ml of rHDL or HDL (Fig. 9). The S1P content in the rHDL was undetectable by our S1P assay method (21Murata N. Sato K. Kon J. Tomura H. Okajima F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 282: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Cell Culture and Transfection—HUVECs (passage number 3) were purchased from Whittaker Bioproducts. The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and several growth factors as previously described (9Kimura T. Sato K. Kuwabara A. Tomura H. Ishiwara M. Kobayashi I. Ui M. Okajima F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31780-31785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 10Kimura T. Sato K. Malchinkhuu E. Tomura H. Tamama K. Kuwabara A. Murakami M. Okajima F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1283-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We usually used 5–8 passages of the cells and checked the cobblestone-like cell shape before experiments. Where indicated, pertussis toxin (PTX, 100 ng/ml) or its vehicle (PBS) was added to the culture medium 24 h before experiments, unless otherwise stated. Transfection of antisense oligonucleotides to block the expression of S1P1 and S1P3 receptors was performed using NovaFECTORTM reagent (VennNova) according to the method of Paik et al. (25Paik J.H. Chae S. Lee M.J. Thangada S. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11830-11837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). 18-mer phosphothioate oligonucleotides used are as follows: antisense EDG-1/S1P1, 5′-GAC GCT GGT GGG CC C CAT-3′ and antisense EDG-3/S1P3, 5′-CGG GAG GGC AGT TGC CAT-3′. The expression of these S1P receptor mRNAs was measured at 12 h, and experiments were started at 16 h after the transfection. Although we have not succeeded in observing S1P receptor protein expression by Western blotting, we confirmed almost complete inhibition of the expression of both S1P receptor mRNAs by Northern blotting under these conditions (10Kimura T. Sato K. Malchinkhuu E. Tomura H. Tamama K. Kuwabara A. Murakami M. Okajima F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1283-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). As for the transfection of siRNAs specific to SR-BI, PDZK1, S1P1, S1P3, Gα12, and Gα13, HUVECs were seeded with a density of 5.0 × 104 cells/cm2 on 96-well plates for adhesion molecule expression and on 6-well plates for quantitative RT-PCR analysis, Western blotting, NOS activation, and NF-κB transcription assay. Sixteen h later, siRNA (100 nm) was introduced into cells using RNAiFect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were further cultured for 48 h. The nonsilencing siRNA (D-001206-13) and siRNAs targeted for SR-BI (M-010592-00), PDZK1 (M-010615-01), S1P1 (M-003655-01) S1P3 (M-005208-01), Gα12 (M-008435-00), and Gα13 (M-009948-00) were from Dharmacon Inc. (Lafayette, CO). THP-1 monocytic cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum.Determination of Cell Surface Expression of Adhesion Molecules by Enzyme Immunoassay—HUVECs were plated on 96-well plates and transfected with antisense oligonucleotides or siRNA as described above. The cells were then washed twice and incubated in RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin with test agents for 8 h. Thereafter cells were washed with PBS twice and fixed with PBS containing 3% formamide under 4 °C. The plates were blocked at 4 °C overnight with 5% skim milk powder in PBS. Cell surface expression of adhesion molecules was determined by primary binding with specific mouse antibody for VCAM-1 or ICAM-1, followed by secondary binding with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody as described previously (15Kimura T. Tomura H. Mogi C. Kuwabara A. Ishiwara M. Shibasawa K. Sato K. Ohwada S. Im D.S. Kurose H. Ishizuka T. Murakami M. Okajima F. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Quantification was performed by determination of colorimetric conversion at an optical density at 450 nm of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine using TMB peroxidase EIA substrate kit (Bio-Rad).Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using TRI REAGENT (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. After DNase I (Promega, Madison, UI) treatment to remove possible traces of genomic DNA contaminating in the RNA preparations, 5 μg of the total RNA was reverse-transcribed using a high capacity cDNA archive kit according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). To evaluate the expression level of mRNAs for SR-BI, PDZK1, S1P1, S1P3,Gα12, and Gα13, quantitative RT-PCR was performed using real time TaqMan technology with sequence detection system model 7700 (Applied Biosystems). The human probes specific to SR-BI, PDZK1, S1P1, S1P3,Gα12, and Gα13 were obtained from TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems). The ID numbers of the products were Hs00194092 for SR-BI, Hs0042004 for PDZK1, Hs00173499 for S1P1, Hs00245464 for S1P3, Hs00170899 for Gα12, Hs00183573 for Gα13, and Hs99999905 for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The expression level of the target mRNA was normalized to the relative ratio of the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA (26Yamada T. Sato K. Komachi M. Malchinkhuu E. Tobo M. Kimura T. Kuwabara A. Yanagita Y. Ikeya T. Tanahashi Y. Ogawa T. Ohwada S. Morishita Y. Ohta H. Im D.S. Tamoto K. Tomura H. Okajima F. J. Biol.

Each RT-PCR assay was performed at least three times, and the results are expressed as the means ± S.E.NF-κB Transcription Assay—HUVECs were transfected with the Lipofectin/nucleic acid mixture including 1 μg of Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen), 1 μg of pNFκB-Luc (Stratagene), and 240 ng of pRL (Renilla luciferase)-SV40 as described previously (15Kimura T. Tomura H. Mogi C. Kuwabara A. Ishiwara M. Shibasawa K. Sato K. Ohwada S. Im D.S. Kurose H. Ishizuka T. Murakami M. Okajima F. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Luciferase reporter assay was performed 48 h after transfection using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Renilla luciferase activity was used to normalize transfection efficiencies among experiments.Western Blotting—HUVECs were cultured and pretreated with several reagents as described above and then incubated for indicated times with test agents. For detection of eNOS phosphorylation (15Kimura T. Tomura H. Mogi C. Kuwabara A. Ishiwara M. Shibasawa K. Sato K. Ohwada S. Im D.S. Kurose H. Ishizuka T. Murakami M. Okajima F. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the reaction was terminated by washing twice with ice-cold PBS and adding 0.1 ml of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 8 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm Na3VO4,5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was separated by 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting with eNOS-specific and eNOS-Ser(P)1177 antibody. As for the detection of SR-BI, PDZK1, and β-actin, the procedures were essentially the same as those for eNOS phosphorylation except for the primary antibody.NOS Enzymatic Activity in Cell Lysate—NOS enzymatic activity was measured according to the method previously described (27Pace M.C. Chambliss K.L. German Z. Yuhanna I.S. Mendelsohn M.E. Shaul P.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L106-L112PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVECs were grown to 80% confluence, and the cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold PBS, harvested from the dishes, and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (27Pace M.C. Chambliss K.L. German Z. Yuhanna I.S. Mendelsohn M.E. Shaul P.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L106-L112PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were disrupted by sonication (Branson Ultrasonics, Chicago, IL) three times for 10 s each. NOS enzymatic activity in the resulting cell lysates was determined by measuring the conversion of l-[3H]arginine to l-[3H]citrulline. Fifty microliters of cell lysate were added to 50 μl of reaction mixtures containing 2 μm cold l-arginine and 2 μCi/ml of l-[3H]arginine. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the assay was terminated by the addition of 400 μl of 40 mm HEPES buffer, pH 5.5, with 2 mm EDTA and 2 mm EGTA. The terminated reactions were applied to 1-ml columns of Dowex AG50WX-8 (Tris form) and eluted with 1 ml of 40 mm HEPES buffer. The l-[3H]citrulline generated was collected into scintillation vials and quantified by liquid scintillation spectroscopy.THP-1 Cell Adhesion Assay—THP-1 monocytic cells were washed twice and resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The cell suspensions were overlaid (1.5 × 106 cells/ml, 500 μl/well) on the confluent monolayers of HUVECs that had been grown in 12-well plates and treated with various reagents. After incubation for 15 min at 37 °C, nonadherent THP-1 monocytic cells were removed by washing four times with prewarmed RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The number of THP-1 monocytic cells on the HUVECs was counted in four places under microscopy at 400× magnification as adhering cells.Data Presentation—All of the experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate. The results of multiple observations are presented as the means ± S.E. of a representative experiment or as a representative result from more than three different batches of cells, unless otherwise stated. Statistical significance was assessed by Student's t test; the values were considered significant at p < 0.05.RESULTSHDL Inhibits S1P-induced Adhesion Molecule Expression through eNOS Activation—TNFα, a well known cytokine for adhesion molecule expression, is more potent than S1P. In the present study, however, we first characterized in detail the action of HDL on exogenous S1P-induced adhesion molecule expression to exclude the possible role of the S1P component of HDL. In accordance with previous results (15Kimura T. Tomura H. Mogi C. Kuwabara A. Ishiwara M. Shibasawa K. Sato K. Ohwada S. Im D.S. Kurose H. Ishizuka T. Murakami M. Okajima F. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), S1P promoted THP-1 monocytic cell adhesion to HUVECs, and S1P-induced cell adhesion was almost completely inhibited by HDL (Fig. 1, A and B). The change in cell adhesion was associated with the change in the expression of VCAM-1 (Fig. 1C, left panel) and ICAM-1 (Fig. 1C, right panel). Thus, HDL inhibited S1P-induced adhesion molecule expression without any significant effect alone. In contrast to HDL, LDL was ineffective for the suppression of adhesion molecule expression (Fig. 1C).FIGURE 1HDL inhibits S1P-induced adhesion molecule expression and NF-κB activation in a manner sensitive to PI 3-kinase and NOS. A and B, HUVECs were incubated for 8 h with or without S1P (1 μm) and HDL (1 mg/ml). THP-1 monocytic cells were then overlaid on the cells. Fifteen minutes later, nonadherent THP-1 cells were removed. A representative photograph is shown in A, and THP-1 cell number in four places under the microscope was counted in B. The results are the means ± S.D. of three wells of a representative experiments. Other two experiments gave similar results. C, the cells were similarly incubated for 8 h with the indicated concentrations of HDL or LDL in the presence or absence of S1P (1 μm) for measurement of VCAM-1 (left panel) and ICAM-1 (right panel) protein expression. D, the cells were transfected with pNFκB-Luc for 48 h. The cells were then treated with S1P (1 μm) and/or HDL (1 mg/ml) in the presence or absence of l-NAME (1 μm) or wortmannin (100 nm) for 8 h, and luciferase reporter assay was performed as NF-κB activity. E, the cells were similarly incubated with the indicated agents of the same concentrations as those in D for 8 h to measure VCAM-1. The results in C–E are the means ± S.E. of three values of a representative experiment. Two other experiments gave similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The inhibitory action of HDL was associated with the inhibition of NF-κB activation (Fig. 1D), which has been shown to be critical for adhesion molecule expression (5Collins T.

Because we previously showed that S1P-induced adhesion molecule expression was inhibited by NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (15Kimura T. Tomura H. Mogi C. Kuwabara A. Ishiwara M.

Signal. 2006; 18: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of NOS inhibitor l-NAME. The HDL-induced inhibition of VCAM-1 expression (Fig. 1E) and NF-κB activation (Fig. 1D) was completely reversed by the NOS inhibitor l-NAME, whereas an inactive derivative d-NAME was ineffective (data not shown). HDL-induced inhibitory actions were also inhibited by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (Fig. 1, D and E). The inhibitory action of HDL on ICAM-1 expression was also reversed by l-NAME and wortmannin (data not shown). These results suggest that PI 3-kinase and NOS are involved in the HDL-induced inhibition of NF-κB-mediated adhesion molecule expression.HDL stimulated the phosphorylation of eNOS (Fig. 2A), reflecting the activation of enzyme activity (Fig. 2B) and thus supporting this proposal. As in a previous study (15Kimura T. Tomura H. Mogi C. Kuwabara A. Ishiwara M. Shibasawa K. Sato K. Ohwada S. Im D.S. Kurose H. Ishizuka T. Murakami M. Okajima F. Cell.

The HDL action was still effective even at 6 or 8 h after stimulation, whereas the S1P action was ineffective at these time points. HDL-induced enzyme activation was completely inhibited by wortmannin (Fig. 2, C and D), as was the short term S1P-induced NOS activation (15Kimura T. Tomura H. Mogi C. Kuwabara A. Ishiwara M.

Diverse metabolic activities of eukaryote cells generate reactive oxygen species, which can damage biological macromolecules, including DNA, proteins, and lipids (1Imlay J.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 395-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). Oxidative damage to biological macromolecules can alter multiple cellular functions and has been implicated in cancer, inflammation, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, and aging (2Nunomura A.

Consequently, eukaryote cells have evolved multiple protective mechanisms against reactive molecules and oxidative stress. A comprehensive analysis of oxidative stress resistance in yeast has identified several core functions, including transcription, protein trafficking, and vacuolar formation that are broadly required for oxidative stress resistance (7Ahmad S.

In mammals, the Keap1 protein has emerged as a major sensor for oxidative stress and electrophilic molecules.

Under basal conditions of cellular redox homeostasis, the N-terminal BTB domain of Keap1 binds to Cul3, whereas the C-terminal Kelch domain of Keap1 binds to the bZIP transcription factor Nrf2 (8Cullinan S.B.

This ubiquitin ligase complex conjugates ubiquitin onto specific lysine residues within the N-terminal Neh2 domain of Nrf2 and targets Nrf2 for degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Cyclical association and dissociation of this E3 ubiquitin ligase complex is required for efficient ubiquitination of Nrf2 and repression of Nrf2-dependent gene expression (11Lo S.C. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Reactive electrophilic chemicals and oxidative stress modify one or more cysteine residues located in the N-terminal BTB and central linker domains of Keap1 and disrupt formation of a functional E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (12Hong F.

Inhibition of Keap1-mediated ubiquitination of Nrf2 results in a marked increase in the steady-state level of Nrf2 and transcription of Nrf2-dependent genes. Induction of Nrf2-dependent genes represents a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress that neutralizes reactive molecules, eliminates damaged macromolecules, and restores cellular redox homeostasis (18Shen G.

For example, β-TrCP, a well characterized substrate adaptor for Cul1, recognizes two substrate proteins, IκBα and β-catenin, after these proteins are phosphorylated on two serine residues embedded within a conserved sequence motif (32Winston J.T.

The PGAM5 gene encodes two protein isoforms, PGAM5-L and PGAM5-S, which result from alternative splicing. Both PGAM5 isoforms contain an N-terminal region of ∼100 amino acids, which includes a conserved NXESGE motif that is required for binding to Keap1, and a C-terminal phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) domain, which binds to Bcl-XL (34Hammond P.W.

PGAM5 is ubiquitinated by a Keap1-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets PGAM5 for proteasome-mediated degradation. Both quinone-induced oxidative stress and sulforaphane inhibit Keap1-dependent ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of PGAM5. Our results establish PGAM5 as a novel substrate of Keap1 and support the notion that Keap1 regulates diverse cellular functions as part of a global response to oxidative stress. Construction of Recombinant DNA Molecules—The PGAM5-L cDNA (accession number BG030775) and the PGAM5-S cDNA (accession number BC008196) were obtained from ATCC and Open Biosystems, respectively. The PGAM5 expression vectors were constructed by cloning PCR-generated fragments containing the entire open reading frame of either PGAM5-L and PGAM5-S into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and the NotI/SmaI sites of pFLAG-CMV2 (Sigma). The mutant PGAM5-L cDNA containing alanines in place of Glu-79 and Ser-80 codons were generated by site-specific mutagenesis with standard overlap-extension techniques. Plasmids expressing wild type and the mutant Keap1, chitin binding domain (CBD)-tagged Keap1, and Cul3 proteins have been previously described (10Zhang D.D. Lo S.C. Cross J.V. Templeton D.J.

All the genes used in this study were sequenced in the context of the expression vectors used for the experiments. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Chemical Reagents—MDA-MB-231, COS1, HEK-293T, and HeLa cells were purchased from the ATCC. Cells were maintained in either Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or Eagle's minimal essential medium in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmid DNA transfections were performed with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (lactacystin) was purchased from Boston Biochem. Sulforaphane and tert-butylhydroquinone were purchased from Sigma. Immunofluorescence Assays—HeLa and COS1 cells were grown on glass coverslips on 35-mm plates. Cells were transfected with 1.0 μg of the empty vector or the expression vectors for the FLAG-PGAM5 proteins. Cells were fixed with 100% methanol at -20 °C for 10 min. Fixed cells were incubated for 40 min with mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibodies (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Cover-slips were washed and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (Jackson Laboratories) for another 40 min. Coverslips were washed and incubated with To-pro-3 (Molecular Probes) for another 30 min. Coverslips were washed and mounted on glass slides. Images were obtained with a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal system coupled to an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope and a digital camera. The images were captured with ImagePro and transferred to Adobe Photoshop for construction of the figure. Antibodies, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblot Analysis—The anti-Keap1 antibody has been described (17Zhang D.D. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8137-8151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). Antibodies against tubulin (Santa Cruz), the chitin binding domain (New England Biolabs), ubiquitin (Sigma), the FLAG epitope (Sigma), the Myc epitope (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the HA epitope (Covance), and Bcl-XL (L-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were purchased from commercial sources. For detection of protein expression in total cell lysates, cells were lysed in sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1% bromphenol blue) at 24-48 h post-transfection. For immunoprecipitation assays cell extracts were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Soluble cell lysates were incubated either with 2 μg of anti-FLAG M2 coupled to agarose (Sigma) or with 2 μg of affinity-purified antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C followed by incubation at 4 °C with protein A-agarose beads (Sigma) for 2 h. Unbound proteins were removed by washing four times with lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted in sample buffer by boiling for 5 min, electrophoresed through SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and subjected to immunoblot analysis. In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—For detection of ubiquitinated PGAM5-L proteins in vivo, cells were transfected with expression vectors for HA-tagged ubiquitin, FLAG-PGAM5-L, and the indicated proteins. Cells were lysed by boiling in a buffer containing 2% SDS, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). This rapid lysis procedure inactivates cellular ubiquitin hydrolases and, therefore, preserves ubiquitin-substrate protein conjugates present in cells before lysis. Protein-protein interactions, including association of PGAM5-L with Keap1, are also disrupted by this lysis procedure. For immunoprecipitation, these lysates were diluted with 4 volumes of a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm DTT, and 1% Triton X-100. The diluted lysates were precleared with protein A-agarose beads (Sigma) and incubated with anti-FLAG M2 agarose (Sigma). HA-ubiquitin conjugates in immunoprecipitated FLAG-PGAM5-L proteins were analyzed by immunoblot analysis with antibodies against the HA epitope. In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—For detection of ubiquitinated PGAM5-L proteins in vitro, cells were transfected with expression vectors for FLAG-PGAM5-L, Keap1-CBD, Myc-Rbx1, and HA-Cul3 proteins. Cells were lysed in buffer B (15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 0.25% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The lysates were pre-cleared with protein A-agarose beads before incubation with chitin beads (New England Biolabs) for 4 h at 4 °C. Chitin beads were washed twice with buffer B, twice with buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Non-idet P-40, and 100 mm NaCl), and twice with reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 0.6 mm DTT). The pellets were incubated with ubiquitin (300 pmol), E1 (2 pmol), E2-UbcH5a (10 pmol), and ATP (2 mm) in 1× reaction buffer in a total volume of 30 μl for 1 h at 37 °C. Ubiquitin, E1, and E2-UbcH5a were purchased from BostonBiochem. The chitin beads were pelleted by centrifugation (3000 × g) and resuspended in 2% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 1 mm DTT and boiled for 5 min to release bound proteins, inactivate any contaminating ubiquitin hydrolases, and disrupt protein-protein interactions. The supernatant was diluted 5-fold with buffer lacking SDS prior to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 agarose. Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-ubiquitin antibodies (Sigma). Mass Spectrometry—Gel slices containing bands A, B, and C as indicated as in Fig. 1A were reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin. Tryptic peptides were desalted and subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry by the MU Proteomics Core using a Voyager DEPro with a 20-Hz 337-nm nitrogen laser (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The Mascot software package was used to match the mass of the peptides with predicted tryptic peptides generated from the translated human genome. Mowse scores of 74 and 172 were obtained for PGAM5 (band B) in two independent experiments. The cut-off values for statistical significance (p < 0.05) in these two experiments were 59 and 63, respectively. The matched peptides from the second experiment are shown in Table 1. A Mowse score of 59 was obtained for CH3L1 (Band A) in the first experiment (cut-off value at p < 0.05 was 59 in this experiment).

Open table in a new tab Identification of PGAM5 as an Interaction Partner of Keap1—To identify new Keap1-interacting proteins, the human Keap1 protein containing a C-terminal CBD was stably expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells, a human breast carcinoma-derived cell line. The Keap1-CBD protein was isolated from cell lysates using chitin beads, and Keap1-associated proteins were visualized on silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Three proteins, ranging in size from 30 to 39 kDa were found to co-purify with the Keap1-CBD protein in a specific and reproducible manner (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4). Tryptic peptides from these three proteins were subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Band A (39 kDa) was tentatively identified as chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CH3L1; NCBI accession number NP_001267), with a border-line Mowse score of 59 in one experiment (the cut-off value for p < 0.05 was 59; data not shown). Bands B and C (32 and 30 kDa, respectively) were identified as phosphoglycerate mutase 5 (PGAM5; NCBI accession number NP_612642) in two independent experiments. The Mowse scores for band B were 74 and 172, well above the cut-off values for statistical significance of 59 and 63, respectively. The position and sequence of the PGAM5-derived peptides identified by MALDI-TOF MS are given in Table 1. A data base search revealed the presence of two mRNA transcripts that originate from the PGAM5 gene located on chromosome 12. The proteins encoded by these mRNAs are identical from amino acid 1-239, with the shorter form (PGAM5-S) containing 16 additional C-terminal amino acids and the longer isoform (PGAM5-L) containing 50 additional C-terminal amino acids (Fig. 2A). Both isoforms of human PGAM5 contain a PGAM domain (pfam00300), which begins at amino acid 98 and extends to the C-terminal end of the longer isoform. The PGAM5 isoforms are distant members of the phosphoglycerate mutase family, with their closest relatives being two proteins, termed STS-1 and STS-2, that do not have phosphoglycerate mutase activity but participate in receptor-mediated signal transduction pathways (37Carpino N.

In particular, the phosphohistidine signature motif that is characteristic of PGAM domains with enzymatic activity is poorly conserved in PGAM5 (39Jedrzejas M.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2000; 73: 263-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2D). A region within the PGAM domain of PGAM5 has previously been shown to bind to Bcl-XL (34Hammond P.W. Alpin J. Rise C.E. Wright M. Kreider B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20898-20906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and the ability of both isoforms of PGAM5 to associate with Bcl-XL was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2E and data not shown). To confirm association between Keap1 and the two PGAM5 isoforms, untagged or FLAG-tagged versions of both PGAM5-S and PGAM5-L were expressed in HEK-293T cells along with the Keap1-CBD protein. Proteins that bound to chitin beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver stain. Both PGAM5 isoforms bound to the Keap1-CBD protein (Fig. 1B, lanes 3-6). The presence of the N-terminal FLAG tag decreased the mobility of both PGAM5 isoforms but did not perturb their ability to associate with Keap1-CBD (Fig. 1B, lanes 7 and 8). The ectopic untagged PGAM5-L protein co-migrated exactly with the endogenous 32-kDa Keap1-associated protein (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 3). In contrast, the mobility of the ectopic untagged PGAM5-S protein was slightly faster than the endogenous Keap1-associated protein of 30 kDa (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 5). This result supports the identification of the Keap1-associated protein of 32 kDa as the PGAM5-L isoform and suggests that the Keap1-associated protein of 30 kDa is not the PGAM5-S isoform but is derived from the 32-kDa protein by proteolysis during purification. To verify the association of both isoforms of human PGAM5 with Keap1, reciprocal pull-down analyses of the proteins in transfected cells were performed. COS1 cells were transfected with expression vectors for untagged Keap and either of the FLAG-tagged PGAM5 isoforms. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies, and the resultant immunoprecipitates were probed for the presence of Keap1. The Keap1 protein was present in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates of both PGAM5 isoforms (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 4). The subcellular localization of both PGAM5 isoforms was determined by indirect immunofluorescence of HeLa cells expressing the FLAG-tagged proteins. The PGAM5-L protein displayed diffuse cytoplasmic staining and a punctate nuclear staining, whereas the PGAM5-S protein displayed a punctate pattern in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3). A similar pattern was observed in COS1 cells (data not shown). Both PGAM isoforms co-localized with the Keap1 protein in the cytoplasm (data not shown). No nuclear staining of Keap1 was observed in our experiments. When co-expressed with Keap1, the cytoplasmic localization of both PGAM5-L and Keap1 shifted from a diffuse pattern to a punctate pattern (data not shown). Keap1 also displayed a punctate cytoplasmic pattern when co-expressed with PGAM5-S (data not shown). In subsequent experiments we focused on the PGAM5-L isoform, as this isoform co-migrated with the 32-kDa protein identified as PGAM5 by mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides and is expressed at higher levels than the PGAM5-S isoform (Fig. 1B). Identification of the Interaction Interface between Keap1 and pGAM5-L—The Keap1 protein possesses five discrete domains: the N-terminal region (N); an N-terminal Broad complex, Tramtrack, and BTB; a central linker domain (Linker); a C-terminal Kelch repeat domain (Kelch); and a C-terminal short tail (C). To determine which domain(s) in Keap1 is responsible for binding to PGAM5, a series of mutant Keap1 proteins containing a specific deletion of each individual domain was expressed in HEK-293T cells along with FLAG-PGAM5-L proteins. Association of the mutant Keap1 proteins and PGAM5-L was assessed by coimmunoprecipitation. Only the Keap1-ΔKelch protein did not associate with PGAM5-L (Fig. 4A, lane 5), indicating that the Kelch domain of Keap1 is required for binding to PGAM5-L. Previous structural and mutational studies have demonstrated that the Kelch domain of Keap1 is a six-bladed β-pro-peller structure that contains a shallow pocket on its top face that binds Nrf2 (23Lo S.C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 54750-54758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The shallow pocket of Keap1 binds an Nrf2-derived peptide containing a highly conserved DXETGE motif. Our previous analysis of more than 30 Keap1 mutant proteins identified seven amino acids in Keap1 whose side chains participate in direct contact with the Nrf2-derived peptide and for which individual alanine substitutions are sufficient to disrupt binding of Nrf2 to Keap1 (23Lo S.C. Li X. Henzl M.T. Beamer L.J. Hannink M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3605-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). These residues are Tyr-334, Arg-380, Asn-382, Arg-415, Arg-483, Tyr-525, and Tyr-572. The charged residues are located at the base of the binding pocket, whereas the hydrophobic residues line the sides of the binding pocket. A set of mutant CBD-tagged Keap1 proteins were characterized for their ability to bind pGAM5-L. Association of the endogenous PGAM5-L protein with these mutant Keap1 proteins was determined by co-purification on chitin beads followed by SDS-PAGE and visualization by silver stain. This analysis revealed 4 amino acid residues, including Tyr-334, Arg-415, Arg-483, and Tyr-572, for which individual alanine substitutions significantly disrupted the ability of Keap1 to bind PGAM5-L (Fig. 4, B, lanes 2 and 13, and C, lanes 5 and 7). The highly conserved DXETGE motif in Nrf2 is required for the association of Nrf2 with Keap1 (23Lo S.C. Li X. Henzl M.T. Beamer L.J. Hannink M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3605-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 25Padmanabhan B. Tong K.I. Ohta T. Nakamura Y. Scharlock M. Ohtsuji M. Kang M.I. Kobayashi A. Yokoyama S. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 689-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The side chains of the glutamate residues contact multiple residues in Keap1, including Arg-380, Asn-382, Arg-415, and Arg-483. The side chains of the aspartate and threonine residues, on the other hand, interact with the backbone of the Nrf2-derived peptide and stabilize a β-turn region that enables the Nrf2-derived peptide to fit into the binding pocket on Keap1. Alanine substitution of the threonine residue within the DXETGE motif markedly reduces binding of Nrf2 to Keap1 and enables the mutant Nrf2 protein to escape Keap1-mediated repression (23Lo S.C. Li X. Henzl M.T. Beamer L.J. Hannink M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3605-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In contrast, serine substitution of this threonine residue did not disrupt the binding of Nrf2 to Keap1, suggesting that the hydroxyl group of the serine residue is an effective substitute for the hydroxyl group of the threonine residue. A NXE(S/T)GE motif, amino acids 77-82 in the human PGAM5 isoforms, is strongly conserved in mammals (Fig. 2C). To determine whether the NXESGE motif in PGAM5-L is required for binding to Keap1, a mutant PGAM5-L protein was constructed in which two alanine substitutions were introduced in place of Glu-79 and Ser-80. FLAG-tagged versions of the wild-type and PGAM5-L-E79A/S80A mutant proteins were expressed in HEK-293T cells along with Keap1-CBD, and association with Keap1 was assessed by immunoblot after affinity purification with anti-FLAG beads. The mutant PGAM5-L-E79A/S80A protein did not bind to Keap1 (Fig. 4D, lane 5). The cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 3M) and association of PGAM5-L with Bcl-XL (Fig. 4D) were not altered by the E79A/S80A mutation. Taken together, these results indicate that four amino acids within the substrate binding pocket on the top face of the Kelch domain of Keap1 form critical contacts with the NXESGE motif in PGAM5-L and support the not"

However, the mechanisms by which it stimulates initiation of DNA replication remain largely unclear. We have analyzed phosphorylation of MCM subunits during cell cycle by examining mobility shift on SDS-PAGE. MCM4 on the chromatin undergoes specific phosphorylation during S phase. Cdc7 phosphorylates MCM4 in the MCM complexes as well as the MCM4 N-terminal polypeptide. Experiments with phospho-amino acid-specific antibodies indicate that the S phase-specific mobility shift is due to the phosphorylation at specific N-terminal (S/T)(S/T)P residues of the MCM4 protein. These specific phosphorylation events are not observed in mouse ES cells deficient in Cdc7 or are reduced in the cells treated with siRNA specific to Cdc7, suggesting that they are mediated by Cdc7 kinase. The N-terminal phosphorylation of MCM4 stimulates association of Cdc45 with the chromatin, suggesting that it may be an important phosphorylation event by Cdc7 for activation of replication origins. Deletion of the N-terminal non-conserved 150 amino acids of MCM4 results in growth inhibition, and addition of amino acids carrying putative Cdc7 target sequences partially restores the growth. Furthermore, combination of MCM4 N-terminal deletion with alanine substitution and deletion of the N-terminal segments of MCM2 and MCM6, respectively, which contain clusters of serine/threonine and are also likely targets of Cdc7, led to an apparent nonviable phenotype. These results are consistent with the notion that the N-terminal phosphorylation of MCM2, MCM4, and MCM6 may play functionally redundant but essential roles in initiation of DNA replication.

These results are consistent with the notion that the N-terminal phosphorylation of MCM2, MCM4, and MCM6 may play functionally redundant but essential roles in initiation of DNA replication. DNA replication proceeds through series of staged reactions involving various protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions on template DNA. In eukaryotes, origin recognition complexes are believed to play central roles in recognition of replication origins and to function as landing pads for other essential replication factors including MCM (minichromosome maintenance proteins) (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar, 2Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). The initiation of DNA replication is under strict regulation of G1 cell cycle signals, which are activated or suppressed by extracellular growth or differentiation signals, respectively (3Aguda B.D. Chaos. 2001; 11: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The G1 cell cycle signals regulate Cdkcyclins and ultimately activate E2F, leading to activation of various components of replication machinery as well as protein kinases (4Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar). Cdk2-cyclinE and Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase are among those activated by the G1 signals and are known to play critical roles in activation of DNA replication origins (5Coverley D. Laman H. Laskey R.A. Nat.

In fission yeast, Hsk1 kinase, the homologue of budding yeast Cdc7 kinase, was shown to phosphorylate MCM4 in the MCM2-MCM4-MCM6-MCM7 complex (25Lee J.K. Seo Y.S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2334-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, precise Cdc7-mediated phosphorylation sites on the MCM subunits are not known, except for a recent report on the N-terminal segment of MCM2 (17Cho W.H. Lee Y.J. Kong S.I. Hurwitz J. Lee J.K.

Only recently, a potential role of phosphorylation of MCM2 N-terminal segment was reported in human cells (48Tsuji T. Ficarro S.B. Jiang W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4459-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this report, we have analyzed phosphorylation of the MCM4 protein in vivo and discovered that Cdc7 is required for this phosphorylation. We have further identified phosphorylation sites on MCM4, which are mediated by Cdc7, and have shown that Cdc7-mediated phosphorylation may play important roles in loading of Cdc45 onto the chromatin. We also show the data suggesting that the phosphorylation of the N-terminal serine/threonine clusters of MCM subunits by Cdc7 may play important but redundant roles in initiation of DNA replication. Cell Synchronization and Preparation of Cell Lysates—HeLa cells were arrested at the G1/S boundary by two successive incubation in the medium containing 2.5 mm thymidine (24 h for each) with an interval of 12 h of growth without thymidine. Cells were then released into medium without thymidine and were harvested at each time point. Cells were also arrested at early S with 0.5 mm mimosine for 24 h, 2 mm HU 2The abbreviations used are: HU, hydroxyurea; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; HA, hemagglutinin; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; tg, transgene. for 12 h, respectively, followed by fractionation into Triton-soluble and -insoluble (chromatin-enriched) fractions, as described previously (26Fujita M.

The whole cell extract was the soluble supernatant of the cells sonicated in CSK buffer (26Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol.

Each fraction was applied on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and MCM2 protein was detected by Western blotting. Synchronization of cell cycle was monitored by flow cytometry analyses of the cells stained with propidium iodine. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) and Transfection—Transfection of siRNA, purchased from Japan Bio Services (Saitama, Japan), was conducted by using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). The siRNA for Cdc7 were Cdc7-1 (27Yoshizawa-Sugata N. Ishii A. Taniyama C. Matsui E. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol.

Construction of Expression Plasmids of Mutant MCM Proteins—The mouse wild-type Mcm4 cDNA was used as a template for PCR mutagenesis to mutate each conserved serine and threonine residues to alanine or glutamic acid. The 6AA or 6EE mutant of MCM4 represents those MCM mutants in which serine and threonine residues of (S/T)(S/T)P at the positions 2-4, 6-8, 30-32, 52-54, 69-71, and 86-88 were replaced with alanine (Ala) or glutamic acid (Glu). Alanine or glutamine mutants of fission yeast MCM2(Cdc19) and MCM4(Cdc21) were constructed in a similar manner. The mutant constructions were verified by DNA sequencing. Each mutant form of mouse MCM4 was expressed on a baculovirus expression vector expressing both MCM4 and MCM6. This virus and the virus expressing MCM2-MCM7 (29You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) were used for coinfection of insect cells to express a MCM2-MCM4-MCM6-MCM7 complex, which was purified as described for the wild-type MCM2 protein preparation (19Masai H.

Immunofluorescence Analyses—Cells, grown on cover slides, were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. DNA was stained with propidium iodide. For immunofluorescence, antibody was used at 1 μg/ml, and secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 546-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG) was used at 1:250 dilution. Development of Phosphopeptide Antibodies and Other Antibodies—Antibodies were developed in rabbit against oligopepetides CMSSPASTPSRRGSRRG (1st to 16th amino acid of human or mouse MCM4), in which the 7th threonine or both 6th serine and 7th threonine were phosphorylated (T7 or S6T7 antibody, respectively). Antibodies were affinity-purified using non-phosphorylated oligonucleotides to remove the antibody reacting with the nonphosphorylated polypeptide. Anti-MCM4 antibody was developed in rabbit against GST-fused C-terminal polypeptide of mouse MCM4 (683-861) and were affinity-purified against the same polypeptide fused to histidine tag. Anti-Cdc45 antibody was developed against the recombinant GST-Cdc45 protein expressed in Escherichia coli and affinity-purified using the His-Cdc45 protein expressed in insect cells. 3K. Tamai, unpublished data. Anti-MCM3 and MCM5 antibodies were prepared in rabbit against bacterially expressed recombinant proteins. Goat anti-MCM2 antibody (sc-9831), goat anti-Cdc6 antibody (sc-6316), mouse monoclonal anti-PCNA antibody (sc-56), and goat anti-LaminB antibody (sc-6217) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-HA antibody (mouse monoclonal antibody, 16B12) was from Babco. Anti-α-tubulin antibody (mouse monoclonal, B-5-1-2) was from Sigma. Anti-RPA (9H8) antibody was from NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA).

Anti-Cdt1 antibody was from Dr. Hideo Nishitani. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—Methods for genetic and biochemical analyses of fission yeast have been described previously (30Matsumoto S. Ogino K.

The following strains were used for this study: NI740 (h+ ade6-M210 ura4-D18 leu1-32), NI284 (h+ ade6-M216 ura4-D18 leu1-32 cdc21-M68), CHP429 (h- ade6-M216 ura4 leu1 his7), MS190 (h- ura4 leu1 his7 cdc19-P1), MS210 (h- ade6-M216 ura4 leu1 his7 Δcdc21::[Pnmt-cdc21:his7+]), MS211 (h- ade6 ura4 leu1 his7 Δcdc21::[Pnmt-Δ67cdc21:his7+]), MS213 (h- ade6 ura4 leu1 his7 Δcdc21::[Pnmt-Δ130cdc21:his7+]), MS240 (h+ ade6-M210 ura4 leu1 his7 Δ47mis5:kan), MS242 (h+ ade6-M210 ura4 leu1 his7 mis5:kan), and Goa1-HA (h- goa1-HA3 ura4-D14 leu1-32 ade6-M26) and Goa1-HA hsk1-89 (h- goa1-HA3 leu1-32 ade6-M210 ura4-D18 hsk1-89:ura4+). Cdc19-A10 or Cdc19-E10 is a Cdc19 (MCM2) mutant in which 10 serine and threonine residues present within its N-terminal 35-amino acid segment were replaced with alanine or glutamic acid, respectively. pREP41-cdc19, pREP41-cdc19-A10, and pREP41-cdc19-E10 are pREP41 derivatives expressing Cdc19 wild-type, Cdc19-A10, and Cdc19-E10, respectively, fused with a C-terminal RGSHis-tag. REP41X-AAP7cdc21 or REP41X-EEP7cdc21 are a pREP41 derivative expressing mutant Cdc21 (MCM4) in which all the seven (S/T)(S/T)P sequences in the N-terminal 129-amino acid segment of Cdc21 were replaced with AAP or EEP sequence, respectively, fused with a C-terminal 3×FLAG-tag. REP41X-Δ67cdc21, REP41X-Δ130cdc21, REP41X-Δ150cdc21, and REP41X-Δ200cdc21 are pREP41 derivatives expressing mutant Cdc21-3FLAG in which N-terminal 67, 130, 150, and 200 amino acids are deleted, respectively. Δ47mis5 is a MCM6 mutant lacking the N-terminal 47 amino acids containing 12 serine and threonine residues. REP41X-mcm6NΔ150cdc21 carries the N-terminal 42 amino acids of fission yeast MCM6 at the N-terminal deletion end point of REP41X-Δ150cdc21-3FLAG. The MCM6 N-terminal fragment was amplified by PCR using the following primers: SpMCM6-N(XhoI) ccgctcgagatgtcttctcttgcatctcag and SpMCM-6-(47-41, XhoI) gctatgctcgaggatgatgga. Cell Cycle-dependent Phosphorylation of Human MCM4 Protein—MCM4 protein was previously reported to be a phosphoprotein (31Fujita M. Yamada C. Tsurumi T. Hanaoka F. Matsuzawa K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17095-17101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 32Pereverzeva I. Whitmire E. Khan B. Coue M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have examined the phosphorylation of MCM4 protein during the cell cycle. HeLa cells were synchronized by release from double thymidine block, which arrests the cells at the G1-S boundary. The synchronous progression of the cell cycle was confirmed by FACS analyses of the DNA stained with propidium iodide (Fig. 1A). Immediately after release, the cells entered S phase, completing it in 8 h. They underwent mitosis at 10-14 h and reentered the next S phase at 18-24 h. We have prepared Triton-soluble and -insoluble extracts from the cells at each stage and analyzed the profiles of various proteins by Western blotting. The former contains the cytoplasmic and nuclear soluble proteins and the latter chromatin-associated or insoluble proteins. The PCNA protein, known to associate with replication forks (33Morris G.F.

Cdt1 was detected in the Triton-soluble fractions mainly during G1 phase at 12-18 h after release (34Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44905-44911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). α-Tubulin, a marker for the cytoplasmic protein, was constitutively detected at a constant level in the Triton-soluble fractions, whereas the LaminB protein was constitutively detected in the chromatinenriched fractions, verifying the fractionation procedure. A portion of MCM4 was detected in the insoluble fractions at the time of release but its level decreased as the S phase progressed. Other MCM proteins also behaved in a similar manner; about a half-population associates with chromatin during G1 and dissociates from the chromatin in late S to G2/M phase, whereas the remainder is detected in the Triton-soluble fraction throughout the cell cycle. This is consistent with the previous results in the Xenopus egg extracts and mammalian cells that MCM is released from the chromatin during the S phase (31Fujita M. Yamada C. Tsurumi T. Hanaoka F.

At the time 0-6 h after the release, slow migrating bands were detected in the insoluble fractions and they appeared again at 16-20 h after the release. This mobility shift was eliminated by prior treatment with phosphatase (data not shown), indicating that it is caused by phosphorylation. In the Triton-soluble fractions, highly mobility-shifted and slow migrating forms accumulated at late S through M phase (6-14 h after release). This phosphorylation was previously reported and was shown to be caused by Cdc2 kinase, as a part of the strategies to ensure the inhibition of the rereplication (31Fujita M. Yamada C. Tsurumi T. Hanaoka F. Matsuzawa K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17095-17101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In Vitro Phosphorylation of MCM4—We have examined whether MCM4 is phosphorylated by Cdc7 in vitro. We have used the mouse MCM2-MCM4-MCM6-MCM7 complex as a substrate for the in vitro phosphorylation reactions. As reported previously, MCM2 in the MCM2-MCM4-MCM6-MCM7 was efficiently phosphorylated by Cdc7, and its mobility on SDS-PAGE shifted downward (16Brown G.W. Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22083-22090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 17Cho W.H. Lee Y.J. Kong S.I. Hurwitz J. Lee J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10281-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar; Fig. 2A). We also observed phosphorylation of MCM4 (as well as MCM6 to a lower extent) in vitro by Cdc7. This phosphorylation caused the mobility shift of MCM4 (Fig. 2A), similar to the one observed in mammalian cells. The level of MCM4 (and MCM6) phosphorylation in the MCM2-MCM4-MCM6-MCM7 complex is lower, compared with that of MCM2 protein (∼4 molecules or 1 molecule of ATP incorporated at max on an average per molecule of MCM2 or MCM4 + MCM6, respectively; see supplemental Fig. S1). This may be due to lack of other factors, such as MCM10, which may enhance the phosphorylation reaction by Cdc7 kinase (25Lee J.K. Seo Y.S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2334-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of MCM4 contains the clusters of serine/threonine residues (see Fig. 7A). Some of these are the targets of Cdk, since they are present as a part of the S/TPXR motif. In vitro and in vivo phosphorylation of these serine/threonine residues by Cdk has been in fact demonstrated (31Fujita M. Yamada C. Tsurumi T. Hanaoka F. Matsuzawa K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17095-17101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 35Ishimi Y. Komamura-Kohno Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34428-34433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We noticed the repeated presence of (S/T)(S/T)P sequences in the N-terminal segments of MCM4 protein across the species and speculated that they may be phosphorylated by Cdc7. Therefore, we have generated mutant MCM4 in which these serine/threonine residues have been replaced by alanine. The “6AA” mutant carries alanine substitutions at the six (S/T)(S/T)P sequences at positions 2-4, 6-8, 30-32, 52-54, 69-71, and 86-88 of mouse MCM4 protein. MCM4(6AA) was expressed as a MCM2-MCM4-MCM6-MCM7 complex in insect cells. The mutation did not affect the complex formation, and the complex could be purified. Although Cdc7 could phosphorylate the MCM2 protein in the MCM2-MCM4(6AA)-MCM6-MCM7 complex, the mobility shift by the phosphorylation of MCM4 was largely eliminated, as indicated by the loss of the labeled and mobility-shifted form of MCM4 (Fig. 2A, top and bottom panels, lanes 1-3 and 6-8). Interestingly, the 6EE mutant form of MCM4, in which the same sets of serine/threonine residues were replaced with glutamic acid to generate the mutant protein mimicking the phosphorylated state, migrated anomalously on SDS-PAGE, similar to the phosphorylated forms of MCM4 (Fig. 2A, lanes 11-15). Next, the N-terminal 198-amino acid polypeptide of MCM4 was used as a substrate for kinase reaction by Cdc2-CyclinB and Cdc7-ASK in vitro. Both Cdc7 and Cdc2 phosphorylate the N-terminal polypeptide (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 5). The level of phosphorylation was reduced with the 6AA mutant form of the same polypeptide (compare lanes 9 and 10 in Fig. 2B), suggesting that these (S/T)(S/T)P sequences are targets of phosphorylation by Cdk and Cdc7. However, a significant level of phosphorylation by Cdc7 was still observed with the 6AA mutant (Fig. 2B, lane 2), indicating that the other residues within the N-terminal region of MCM4 (see Fig. 7A) can be phosphorylated by Cdc7. The level of phosphorylation significantly increased in the presence of both Cdc7 and Cdc2 kinases (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1, 5, and 9), suggesting the concerted action of the two kinases. Similar stimulatory effect of Cdk on phosphorylation of MCM2 was previously reported (17Cho W.H. Lee Y.J. Kong S.I. Hurwitz J. Lee J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 11521-11526Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19Masai H. Matsui E. You Z. Ishimi Y. Tamai K. Arai K. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10281-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, the efficacy of MCM4 phosphorylation in the MCM4N polypeptide was significantly lower than that of MCM4 in the MCM2-MCM4-MCM6-MCM7 complex (∼0.2 molecule of ATP incorporated at maximum per molecule of MCM4), suggesting that the MCM4 segment outside the N-terminal tail and/or other MCM subunits facilitate the substrate recognition by Cdc7 kinase. These results indicate that the N-terminal segment of MCM4 contains multiple Cdc7-mediated phosphorylation sites, some of which are stimulated by prior phosphorylation by Cdk. The N-terminal Segment of MCM4 Is Phosphorylated by Cdc7 in Vivo—We then generated an antibody that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated forms of MCM4 at one of the above (S/T)(S/T)P residues (serine 6 and threonine 7). We have designed the phosphopeptide, which carries a phosphoserine and a phosphothreonine at the 6th and 7th position, respectively, as well as the one which carries only a phosphothreonine at the 7th position. The S6T7 antibody strongly reacted with MCM4N protein, when it was incubated with Cdc2-CyclinB and Cdc7 kinases (Fig. 2C, lane 3). The Western blotting of the cell cycle synchronized extract showed that the S6T7 antibody detected the mobility-shifted form of MCM4 in the Tritoninsoluble fraction at 0-6 h and 18-24 h after the release from double thymidine block, suggesting that S6T7 is indeed phosphorylated on the chromatin during the S phase (Fig. 1B). Phosphorylation was also detected with the S6T7 antibody in the Triton-soluble fractions at 12-14 h and 24 h after the release. This represents the phosphorylation of S6T7 in nuclear soluble or cytoplasm fractions during M phase and may be mediated by Cdc7-ASKL1/Drf1 present in the Triton-soluble fractions during G2-M (27Yoshizawa-Sugata N. Ishii A. Taniyama C. Matsui E. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13062-13070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast, the T7 antibody, developed against the polypeptide carrying only the phosphothreonine 7, detected the mobility-shifted forms of MCM4 specifically in the Triton-soluble fractions, the amount of which peaked at 10-14 h or 24 h after release. This phosphorylation is most likely mediated by Cdc2 kinase, as was reported previously (31Fujita M. Yamada C. Tsurumi T. Hanaoka F. Matsuzawa K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17095-17101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of chromatin-enriched fraction of HU-treated HeLa cells with MCM2 or MCM4 antibody indicates interaction between these two MCM subunits. Immunoprecipitation with S6T7 antibody indicates the selective precipitation of the phosphorylated forms of MCM4 and coimmunoprecipitation of lower band of MCM2 (Fig. 1C), which is generated by phosphorylation by Cdc7 kinase (19Masai H.

Carpani D. Brotherton D. Albanese C. Santocanale C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7110-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This suggests that both MCM2 and MCM4 subunits in the MCM complex are phosphorylated by Cdc7 on the chromatin. Since the phosphorylation of MCM4 on the chromatin takes place at the early S phase and continues during the S phase, the kinase responsible for this phosphorylation needs to be active throughout S phase. Cdc7 is known to be activated at the G1/S junction and to stay active during the S phase. In fact, Cdc7 protein is detected in the Triton-insoluble fractions throughout the S phase and even during G2 phases (Fig. 1B). We therefore examined whether the appearance of this mobility-shifted, phosphorylated forms of MCM4 depends on the Cdc7 functions. We used the mutant mouse ES cell line in which the Cdc7 gene can be conditionally inactivated (36Kim J.M. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Saito I. Katsuki M. Arai K. Masai H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2168-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Inactivation of Cdc7 in ES cells results in increased late S phase population (Fig. 2A).

Recombinant human polymerase (pol) δ also copied past these two lesions but was totally blocked by O6-[4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)butyl] (Pob)G, an important mutagenic lesion formed following metabolic activation of the tobacco-specific carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone. The human translesion pols ι and κ produced mainly only 1-base incorporation opposite O6-MeG and O6-BzG and had very low activity in copying O6-PobG. Human pol η copied past all three adducts. Steady-state kinetic analysis showed similar efficiencies of insertion opposite the O6-alkylG adducts for dCTP and dTTP with pol η and κ; pol ι showed a strong preference for dTTP. pol η, ι, and κ showed pre-steady-state kinetic bursts for dCTP incorporation opposite G and O6-MeG but little, if any, for O6-BzG or O6-PobG. Analysis of the pol η O6-PobG products indicated that the insertion of G was opposite the base (C) 5′ of the adduct, but this product was not extended. Mass spectrometry analysis of all of the pol η primer extension products indicated multiple components, mainly with C or T inserted opposite O6-alkylG but with no deletions in the cases of O6-MeG and O6-PobG. With pol η and O6-BzG, products were also obtained with –1 and –2 deletions and also with A inserted (opposite O6-BzG). The results with pol η may be relevant to some mutations previously reported with O6-alkylG adducts in mammalian cells.

Chemical and physical damage to DNA can cause mutations and ultimately cancer, cardiovascular disease, aging, and other diseases (1Bauer K.H. Mutationstheorie der Geschwulstenstehung. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1928Google Scholar, 4Gasiewicz T.A. Neurotoxicology. 1997; 18: 393-413PubMed Google Scholar). This damage can result from endogenous agents or exogenous chemicals. Many types of damage are known, and the biological effects can vary considerably. One of the prominent types of damage is alkylation at the O-6 atom of guanine (5Loveless A. Nature. 1969; 223: 206-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 6Lawley P.D. Searle C.E. Chemical Carcinogens. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1984: 325-484Google Scholar). O6-AlkylG 4The generic term “alkyl” is used to include both alkyl and aralkyl (Bz) groups for convenience. lesions are some of the more mutagenic lesions formed from DNA-alkylating agents (5Loveless A.

A. 1989; 86: 8271-8274Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The ability of O6-alkylG adducts to cause mutations has been demonstrated directly in site-specific mutagenesis experiments with defined adducts (8Green C.L. Loechler E.L. Fowler K.W. Essigmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Pauly G.T. Hughes S.H. Moschel R.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9169-9177Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Further support for the view that these are deleterious species derives from the existence of specific DNA repair systems for this type of damage in almost all species, ranging from most bacteria to humans (13Pegg A.E. Dolan M.E. Moschel R.C. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 51: 167-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 14Memisoglu A. Samson L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 31: 405-447Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Different alkylating agents form O6-alkylG adducts, and structure-activity relationships are important for understanding the basic mechanisms of how DNA polymerases function as well as issues such as carcinogenesis.

O6-EthylG and O6-BzG produce some nontargeted mutations in the H-ras gene in Rat4 cells (9Bishop R.E. Pauly G.T. Moschel R.C. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Previous work on blockage and misincorporation opposite O6-MeG and O6-BzG has been done in this laboratory with the replicative model polymerases pol T7– and HIV-1 RT (16Woodside A.M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and by others with several DNA polymerases, mostly bacterial (7Singer B. Chavez F. Goodman M.F. Essigmann J.M.

Some of the more significant conclusions with pol T7– and HIV-1 RT were that the bulk of the adduct at the O-6 atom had an inhibitory effect and that an inactive polymerase-oligonucleotide complex is in equilibrium with the functional form (16Woodside A.M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Woodside A.M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1039-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Studies with pol T7– and HIV-1 RT indicated that the effect of size at the N-2 atom is more severe than at the O-6 atom (16Woodside A.M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Woodside A.M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1039-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20Choi J.Y.

However, these issues have not been addressed in detail with mammalian DNA polymerases, particularly replicative pol δ and the so-called translesion polymerases that bypass damage in cells (Y family, e.g. pol η, ι, and κ). We have systematically addressed the issue of the effect of bulk at the N-2 guanine atom on the insertion of dNTPs by several of the above polymerases (21Choi J.Y. Guengerich F.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 72-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 23Choi J.Y. Angel K.C. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21062-21072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and we now apply similar quantitative approaches to O6-alkylG adducts varying in size. The studies with O6-MeG and O6-BzG were extended to the larger adduct O6-PobG, which is of relevance to tobacco-induced carcinogenesis (24Pauly G.T. Peterson L.A. Moschel R.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 28Hecht S.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 560-603Crossref Scopus (984) Google Scholar). The O6-PobG adduct is formed from the “tobacco-specific” carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosoamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone in vivo (27Thomson N.M. Kenney P.M. Peterson L.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2003; 16: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and has been demonstrated to be mutagenic in both bacterial and mammalian cells (24Pauly G.T. Peterson L.A. Moschel R.C. Chem. Res.

Toxicol. 2005; 18: 1619-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We found an effect of adduct size at the O-6 atom of G on activities of all the human DNA polymerases examined. The increase in adduct size resulted in attenuated steady-state kcat/Km parameters and a loss of the rapid burst phase in pre-steady-state analyses. The effects of the increased bulk varied with human polymerases pol δ, η, ι, and κ. Of these polymerases, pol η was clearly the most efficient in handling the bulkier lesions. O6-PobG posed an almost complete block to pol δ. LC-MS/MS analysis of the pol η product of the O6-BzG reaction indicated unexpected phenomena, –1 and –2 frameshifts and insertion of A, which may be relevant to complex phenomena observed previously in cells (24Pauly G.T. Peterson L.A. Moschel R.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).

Reaction Conditions for Enzyme Assays—Standard DNA polymerase reactions were done in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 5 mm DTT, 100 μg of bovine serum albumin ml–1 (w/v), and 10% glycerol (v/v) with 100 nm primer-template at 37 °C (20Choi J.Y.

Biol. 2005; 352: 72-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Primers were 5′-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase/[γ-32P]ATP and annealed with template (36-mer). All reactions were initiated by the addition of dNTP solutions containing MgCl2 (5 mm final concentration) to preincubated enzyme/DNA mixtures. Primer Extension Assay with All Four dNTPs (“Run-on” or “Standing Start” Experiments)—A 32P-labeled primer, annealed to either an unmodified or modified (O6-alkylG) template, was generally extended in the presence of all four dNTPs (100 μm each) for 15 min. In some cases (extension of A:O6-alkylG mismatches), the dNTP concentrations were raised to 1 mm, and the incubation time was 60 min. Reaction mixtures (8 μl) were quenched with 2 volumes of a solution of 20 mm EDTA in 95% formamide (v/v) (20Choi J.Y. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19217-19229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Products were resolved using a 16% PAGE system (w/v) containing 8 m urea and visualized using a Molecular Imager FX and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Steady-state Kinetic Analyses—A 32P-labeled primer, annealed to either an unmodified or adducted template, was extended in the presence of varying concentrations of a single dNTP. The molar ratio of primer-template complex to enzyme was at least 10:1. Polymerase concentrations and reaction times were chosen so that maximal product formation was ≤20% of the substrate concentration (34Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The primer-template complex was extended with dNTP in the presence of 0.1–5 nm enzyme for 5–30 min. All reactions (8 μl) were done at ≥10 dNTP concentrations (in duplicate) and quenched with 2 volumes of a solution of 20 mm EDTA in 95% formamide (v/v) (20Choi J.Y. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol.

Products were resolved using 16% polyacrylamide gels (w/v) containing 8 m urea and quantitated with PhosphorImaging analysis using a Molecular Imager FX instrument and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Graphs of product formation versus dNTP concentration were fit using nonlinear regression (hyperbolic fits) in GraphPad Prism version 3.0 (San Diego, CA) for the determination of kcat and Km values. Pre-steady-state Reactions—Rapid quench experiments were performed using a model RQF-3 KinTek Quench Flow Apparatus (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). Reactions were initiated by rapid mixing of 32P-primer-template/polymerase mixtures (12.5 μl) with the dNTP-Mg2+ complex (10.9 μl) and then quenched with 0.3 m EDTA after reaction times varying from 5 ms to 4 s with G in the template (or 8 s for O6-MeG- and O6-BzG-, or 30 s for O6-PobG-containing DNA) (21Choi J.Y. Guengerich F.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 72-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 23Choi J.Y. Angel K.C. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol.

Reaction products were mixed with 450 μl of a formamide/dye solution (20 mm EDTA, 95% formamide (v/v), 0.5% bromphenol blue (w/v), and 0.05% xylene cyanol (w/v)) and separated using denaturing electrophoresis gels, with quantitation as described for the steady-state reactions. Pre-steady-state data points were fit to the following burst equation: y = A(1 – e–kpt) + ksst, whereas y indicates the concentration of product; A indicates the burst amplitude; kp indicates the pre-steady-state rate of nucleotide incorporation; t indicates time, and kss indicates the steady-state rate of nucleotide incorporation (not normalized for enzyme concentration in the equation) (35Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 36Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 38-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), using nonlinear regression analysis in GraphPad Prism version 3.0. Phosphorothioate Analysis—With the 32P-primer annealed to either an unmodified or adducted template, reactions were initiated by rapid mixing of 32P-primer-template/polymerase mixtures (12.5 μl) with Sp-dCTPαS-Mg2+ complex (or dCTP-Mg2+) (10.9 μl) and then quenched with 0.3 m EDTA after reaction times varying from 5 ms to 30 s for O6-PobG-containing DNA. Products were analyzed as described for the pre-steady-state reactions (see above). LC-MS/MS Analysis of Oligonucleotide Products from pol η Reactions—In a typical reaction, 1–4 nmol of DNA (primer-template) and 50–100 pmol of pol η were mixed in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7) containing 2 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 μg of bovine serum albumin ml–1 in a total volume of 100 μl. The reaction was initiated by adding 1 mm each of four dNTPs and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by removal of the excess dNTPs using a spin column (Bio-Spin 6 chromatography column, Bio-Rad). To the above filtrate (∼100 μl), Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm), DTT (2 mm), and UDG (6 units) were added, and the volume was made up to 200 μl (37Zang H. Goodenough A.K. Choi J.Y. Irminia A. Loukachevitch L.V. Kozekov I.D. Angel K.C. Rizzo C.J. Egli M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29750-29764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was incubated for 5 h at 37 °C, then heated at 95 °C for 1 h in the presence of 0.5 m piperidine, and finally concentrated to dryness by lyophilization; the residue was dissolved in 100 μl of H2O for LC-MS/MS analysis. LC-MS/MS was performed on an Acquity ultraperformance liquid chromatography system (Waters Associates) connected to a Finnigan LTQ mass spectrometer (ThermoElectron Corp., San Jose, CA), operating in the ESI negative ion mode and using an Acquity ultraperformance liquid chromatography system BEH octadecylsilane (C18) column (1.7 μm, 1.0 × 100 mm). LC conditions were as follows: buffer A contained 10 mm NH4CH3CO2 plus 2% CH3CN (v/v), and buffer B contained 10 mm NH4CH3CO2 plus 95% CH3CN (v/v). The following gradient program was used with a flow rate of 150 μl min–1: 0–3 min, linear gradient from 100% A to 97% A/3% B (v/v); 3–4.5 min, linear gradient to 80% A/20% B (v/v); 4.5–5 min, linear gradient to 100% B; 5–5.5 min, hold at 100% B; 5.5–6.5 min, linear gradient to 100% A; 6.5–9.5 min, hold at 100% A. The temperature of the column was maintained at 50 °C. Samples (10 μl) were infused with an autosampler system. ESI conditions were as follows: source voltage 4 kV, source current 100 μA, auxiliary gas flow rate setting 20, sweep gas flow rate setting 5, sheath gas flow setting 34, capillary voltage –49 V, capillary temperature 350 °C, tube lens voltage –90 V. MS/MS conditions were as follows: normalized collision energy 35%, activation Q 0.250, and activation time 30 ms. Product ion spectra were acquired over the range m/z 300–2000. The triply (negatively) charged species were generally used for CID analysis; in some cases the –4 ions were used. The calculations of the CID fragmentations of oligonucleotide sequences were done using a program linked to the Mass Spectrometry Group of Medicinal Chemistry at the University of Utah (38Rozenski J. McCloskey J.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 13: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Overall Strategy—As in previous work with the two replicative viral polymerases HIV-1 RT and pol T7– (16Woodside A.M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Woodside A.M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1039-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), comparisons were made with the four human DNA polymerases (δ, η, ι, and κ) with Me and Bz substituents at the O-6 atom of G. In addition, an even larger adduct of direct relevance to tobacco-induced carcinogenesis, O6-PobG, was included in comparisons. Initial studies involved extension of a 24-mer primer opposite templates containing each of the adducts, followed by more quantitative steady-state kinetic analysis of the insertion reactions. Further analysis involved pre-steady-state kinetic measurements of incorporation with three of the polymerases (η, ι, and κ). The most active polymerase with all three O6-alkylG adducts (pol η) was analyzed to characterize all the products. Primer Extension Past O6-AlkylG Adducts Using All Four dNTPs—Preliminary studies indicated that pol δ activity is stimulated by the presence of PCNA. None of the other polymerases were stimulated by the addition of PCNA under these conditions, without or with these or any of several other DNA adducts (21Choi J.Y. Guengerich F.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 72-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 23Choi J.Y. Angel K.C. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21062-21072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). pol δ readily extended the primer opposite the O6-MeG and O6-BzG templates but was completely blocked by O6-PobG, and exonuclease activity was seen in the latter case (Fig. 2A). pol η was hindered by all of the O6-alkylG adducts but nevertheless extended all three (Fig. 2B). The product derived from the primer opposite O6-PobG appeared not to be full-length, and the analysis is considered later in this work. pol ι showed considerable 1-base incorporation opposite O6-MeG and O6-BzG but little opposite O6-PobG (Fig. 2C). pol κ showed limited 1-base incorporation and extension beyond O6-MeG and O6-BzG but very little activity with O6-PobG (Fig. 2D). Steady-state Kinetics of dNTP Incorporation Opposite G and O6-AlkylG Adducts—Preliminary analyses with individual dNTPs showed that, as with processive polymerases (16Woodside A.M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 39Tan H.B. Swann P.F. Chance E.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5335-5346Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), mainly C or T was incorporated opposite O6-MeG and O6-BzG. With O6-PobG, some dGTP incorporation also occurred, and incorporation was subsequently measured with all four dNTPs with pol η. Rates of incorporation of dATP by pol η were also measured for all three adducts because of results obtained later in the work (see below). Rates were measured as a function of the concentration of each dNTP, and the steady-state kinetic parameters were determined (Table 2).TABLE 2Steady-state kinetic parameters for 1-base incorporation by human pol δ, η, ι, and κPolymeraseTemplatedNTPKmkcatkcat/Kmf (misinsertion frequency)μms-1mm-1 s-1pol δ/PCNAGC0.049 ± 0.0090.0096 ± 0.00011961T210 ± 200.022 ± 0.0010.100.00051O6-MeGC1.3 ± 0.30.021 ± 0.001161T1.3 ± 0.10.022 ± 0.001171.0O6-BzGC7.8 ± 0.90.016 ± 0.0012.11T8.1 ± 0.90.016 ± 0.0012.00.95pol ηGC2.6 ± 0.30.41 ± 0.011601T130 ± 200.15 ± 0.011.20.008A98 ± 410.0021 ± 0.00020.020.0001O6-MeGC8.7 ± 0.90.14 ± 0.01161T14 ± 30.20 ± 0.01140.88A84 ± 320.0027 ± 0.00020.030.0002O6-BzGC51 ± 60.13 ± 0.012.51T72 ± 110.22 ± 0.013.11.2A61 ± 110.0021 ± 0.00010.030.01O6-PobGC190 ± 200.12 ± 0.010.631G77 ± 110.010 ± 0.0010.130.21T270 ± 500.0013 ± 0.00010.00480.008A66 ± 180.0029 ± 0.00020.040.07pol ιGC88 ± 120.23 ± 0.012.61T640 ± 600.30 ± 0.010.470.18O6-MeGC360 ± 400.19 ± 0.010.531T190 ± 301.0 ± 0.15.310O6-BzGC260 ± 500.26 ± 0.021.01T170 ± 200.57 ± 0.023.43.4O6-PobGC400 ± 1200.00021 ± 0.000030.00051G94 ± 180.00044 ± 0.000020.00469.2T82 ± 110.00068 ± 0.000020.008216pol κGC8.4 ± 0.90.31 ± 0.0136.91T6800 ± 7000.38 ± 0.020.0560.0015O6-MeGC790 ± 600.27 ± 0.010.341T2400 ± 3000.58 ± 0.040.240.71O6-BzGC400 ± 700.016 ± 0.0010.041T1400 ± 1000.031 ± 0.0010.0220.55O6-PobGC2400 ± 3000.0091 ± 0.00060.00371G110 ± 200.00043 ± 0.000030.00391.1T250 ± 700.000053 ± 0.0000040.000210.057 Open table in a new tab The most meaningful parameters in this work are kcat/Km, the catalytic specificity, and f, the misinsertion frequency, which is based on the ratio of insertion of the incorrect dNTP to that of dCTP (40Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pol δ, η, and κ showed similar incorporation efficiencies for dCTP and dTTP with both O6-MeG and O6-BzG, similar to the case of HIV-1 RT (16Woodside A.M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). pol ι inserted T in preference to C, by an order of magnitude, similar to the case of pol T7–, for both O6-MeG and O6-BzG (16Woodside A.M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). With O6-PobG in the template, dGTP was also incorporated. The order of preference of individual dNTPs varied among the polymerases, showing the order (based on kcat/Km) C > G > A > T for pol η, T > G > C for pol ι, and C ∼ G > T for pol κ. The kcat/Km for dCTP incorporation opposite O6-PobG by pol η is considerably less than for O6-MeG or O6-BzG by the same enzyme but still much higher than for incorporation of any dNTPs opposite this adduct by any of the other polymerases. Pre-steady-state Burst Kinetics of dNTP Incorporation Opposite G and O6-AlkylG Adducts—Steady-state kinetic parameters are useful in understanding DNA polymerases but are limited in the amount of information they can provide in terms of mechanistic details about catalysis (41Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, pre-steady-state kinetic measurements have not been reported previously for any of these enzymes with O6-alkylG substrates. As expected from the results of studies with other oligonucleotide sequences, kinetic bursts were observed with pol η, ι, and κ for insertion of dCTP opposite G (Figs. 3 and 4) (21Choi J.Y. Guengerich F.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 72-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 23Choi J.Y. Angel K.C. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21062-21072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These results indicate that a step in catalysis occurring after product formation is at least partially rate-limiting (42Johnson K.A. Johnson K.A. Kinetic Analysis of Macromolecules, A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2003: 1-18Google Scholar). The bursts seen with pol ι (Fig. 4) do not break as sharply as with pol η and pol κ (Fig. 3), probably because of the slower kp. (The amount of pol δ available was not sufficient to conduct these experiments.)FIGURE 4Pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of incorporation of dCTP and dTTP o"

https://openalex.org/W2043521546,"Proteolytic shedding is an important step in the functional down-regulation and turnover of most membrane proteins at the cell surface. Extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) is a multifunctional glycoprotein that has two Ig-like domains in its extracellular portion and functions in cell adhesion as an inducer of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in surrounding cells. Although the shedding of EMMPRIN is reportedly because of cleavage by metalloproteinases, the responsible proteases, cleavage sites, and stimulants are not yet known. In this study, we found that human tumor HT1080 and A431 cells shed a 22-kDa EMMPRIN fragment into the culture medium. The shedding was enhanced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and inhibited by TIMP-2 but not by TIMP-1, suggesting the involvement of membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMPs). Indeed, down-regulation of the MT1-MMP expression in A431 cells using small interfering RNA inhibited the shedding. The 22-kDa fragment was purified, and the C-terminal amino acid was determined. A synthetic peptide spanning the cutting site was cleaved by MT1-MMP in vitro. The cleavage site is located in the linker region connecting the two Ig-like domains. The N-terminal Ig-like domain is important for the MMP inducing activity of EMMPRIN and for cell-cell interactions, presumably through its ability to engage in homophilic interactions, and the 22-kDa fragment retained the ability to augment MMP-2 expression in human fibroblasts. Thus, the MT1-MMP-dependent cleavage eliminates the functional N-terminal domain of EMMPRIN from the cell surface, which is expected to down-regulate its function. At the same time, the released 22-kDa fragment may mediate the expression of MMPs in tumor tissues.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-binding endopeptidases responsible for the turnover of many proteins in the extracellular space, including those that compose the extracellular matrix (ECM), cell adhesion molecules, cytokines, growth factors, and receptors (20Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5134) Google Scholar). Most tumor types and the surrounding stromal cells overexpress multiple MMPs, which are important players in promoting tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis (20Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5134) Google Scholar). EMMPRIN also induces MMP-2, -3, and -9, MT1-MMP, and MT2-MMP in addition to MMP-1 (9Kanekura T. Chen X. Kanzaki T. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 99: 520-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 21Kataoka H. DeCastro R. Zucker S. Biswas C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3154-3158PubMed Google Scholar, 25Tang Y. Kesavan P. Nakada M.T. Yan L. Mol. Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 73-80PubMed Google Scholar); only glycosylated EMMPRIN is able to induce these MMPs (26Sun J. Hemler M.E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2276-2281PubMed Google Scholar), and the N-terminal Ig-like domain is also indispensable for the MMP inducing activity (26Sun J. Hemler M.E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2276-2281PubMed Google Scholar), as well as for the homophilic interactions of the protein (26Sun J. Hemler M.E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2276-2281PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, EMMPRIN potentially mediates the excessive production of MMPs in tumor tissue and is expected to act as a modulator of ECM in tumor tissues through the activity of the MMPs that it induces. According to the literature, EMMPRIN is released from tumor cells in at least two different ways. A significant amount of intact EMMPRIN is released from tumor cells (27Taylor P.M. Woodfield R.J. Hodgkin M.N. Pettitt T.R. Martin A. Kerr D.J. Wakelam M.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5765-5772Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 28Sidhu S.S. Mengistab A.T. Tauscher A.N. LaVail J. Basbaum C. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), possibly contained within membrane vesicles (microvesicles) that some tumor cells release upon stimulation (28Sidhu S.S. Mengistab A.T. Tauscher A.N. LaVail J. Basbaum C. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The other pathway is proteolytic shedding. In addition to inducing MMPs, EMMPRIN is likely to be cleaved and shed by MMPs or other metalloproteinases, because the shedding of EMMPRIN is inhibited by zinc chelators (25Tang Y. Kesavan P. Nakada M.T. Yan L. Mol. Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 73-80PubMed Google Scholar, 29Haug C. Lenz C. Diaz F. Bachem M.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1823-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Supporting this, MMP-1 and MMP-2 can cleave EMMPRIN at the membrane-proximal region, at least in vitro (29Haug C. Lenz C. Diaz F. Bachem M.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1823-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The proteolytic shedding of EMMPRIN from the cell surface is not only important for regulating EMMPRIN function at the cell surface but is also a mechanism to release a soluble MMP inducer. However, the details of the proteolytic processing of EMMPRIN, such as the responsible proteinases, cleavage sites, and stimulants, is very limited. In this context, MT1-MMP (MMP-14) is an interesting candidate for the EMMPRIN shedding as an integral membrane protease responsible for pericellular proteolysis (30Seiki M. Koshikawa N. Yana I. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 129-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 31Itoh Y. Seiki M. J. Cell Physiol. 2006; 206: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). MT1-MMP is expressed in human tumors, and its potential substrates are ECM proteins, such as collagens, fibronectin, laminins, vitronectin, and aggrecan (30Seiki M. Koshikawa N. Yana I. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 129-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 31Itoh Y. Seiki M. J. Cell Physiol. 2006; 206: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Other functional proteins that can be cleaved by MT1-MMP include pro-MMPs, CD44, the integrin αv chain, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, interleukin 8, and pro-tumor necrosis factor (32Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar, 37Tam E.M. Morrison C.J. Wu Y.I. Stack M.S. Overall C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6917-6922Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Thus, the proteolytic activity of MT1-MMP is a potent modulator of the pericellular environment and promotes tumor growth and invasion, particularly in collagen-rich environments (38Hotary K.B. Allen E.D. Brooks P.C. Datta N.S. Long M.W. Weiss S.J. Cell. 2003; 114: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Our knowledge about the physiological substrates of MT1-MMP is still fragmentary, but proteins that can be cleaved by MT1-MMP are often co-purified with it from cell lysates, and EMMPRIN is among the proteins we identified as co-purifying with MT1-MMP. 3N. Egawa, N. Koshikawa, T. Tomari, K. Nabeshima, T. Isobe, and M. Seiki, unpublished results. Thus, we were interested in the possibility that MT1-MMP cleaves and releases EMMPRIN from tumor cells. In this study, we characterized the proteolytic shedding of EMMPRIN by MT1-MMP for the first time. Two of the three human tumor cell lines tested released a small 22-kDa fragment of EMMPRIN. The shedding was enhanced by treatment of the cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and inhibited by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2 but not by TIMP-1, indicating the possible involvement of MT-MMPs. Indeed, expression, knockdown, and in vitro cleavage studies supported the involvement of MT1-MMP in EMMPRIN proteolysis. Our results raise the interesting possibility that MT1-MMP may trigger the expression of MMPs in tumor tissues. Cells and Culture Conditions—The human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080, human epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431, and human melanoma cell line A375 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA), and the African green monkey kidney cell line COS-7 was obtained from Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan). The gastric cancer cell line TMK-1 was a gift from Prof. E. Tahara (Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan). Human primary fibroblast cells were obtained from nonlesional dermis around nodular fasciitis according to the guideline for clinical sample handling in Fukuoka University Hospital. A431, HT1080, COS-7, and human normal fibroblast cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin (Sigma). TMK-1 and A375 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, streptomycin, and penicillin. MT1-MMP-inducible expression cell lines were established using the Tet-Off gene expression system (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan) as described previously (39Nakamura H. Suenaga N. Taniwaki K. Matsuki H. Yonezawa K. Fujii M. Okada Y. Seiki M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 876-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The cells were seeded in 6-well plates (1.5 × 105 cells/well) and cultured for 16 h before transfection. Expression plasmids were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were kindly gifted from Daiichi Fine Chemical (Takaoka, Japan). Construction of Expression Vectors—FLAG-tagged MTMMP constructs (MT1, MT2, MT3, MT4, MT5, and MT6) were prepared as described previously (34Kajita M. Itoh Y. Chiba T. Mori H. Okada A. Kinoh H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 40Kojima S. Itoh Y. Matsumoto S. Masuho Y. Seiki M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The other cDNAs were subcloned into pENTR/D-TOPO vectors (Invitrogen) using the Gateway System (Invitrogen). We amplified a cDNA sequence corresponding to the open reading frame of human EMMPRIN using the PCR, and then generated expression constructs for a Myc-tagged form (NM-EMMPRIN) or a FLAG-tagged form (NF-EMMPRIN) in which each tag was inserted downstream of its signal sequence by a PCR-based method. We also generated an expression construct for a C-terminally FLAG-tagged EMMPRIN fragment (from Met1 to Thr121) containing the N-terminal Ig-like domain (D1) by a PCR-based method. Establishment of Stable Transfectants—Cells expressing EMMPRIN or MT1-MMP were established using the ViraPower lentiviral expression system (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The pLenti6 vectors for mock, NF-EMMPRIN, MT1-MMP, or D1 and the packaging plasmid mixture were introduced into 293FT packaging cells provided within the kit. The recombinant lentiviruses in the conditioned medium were harvested and titrated using A431 cells. Transductions were performed at a multiplicity of infection of 5, and the cells were propagated and maintained in the presence of blasticidin (5 μg/ml; Invitrogen). Western Blot Analysis—To detect proteins in the conditioned medium (CM), proteins in the CM were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and precipitates were collected and dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Total cell lysates (TCL) and proteins in the CM were separated by SDS-PAGE (10 and 14% gels, respectively) under reducing conditions, and proteins separated in the gel were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). After blocking the membrane with 5% fat-free dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20, the membrane was probed with a primary antibody specific to each protein, including an anti-EMMPRIN rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb, Invitrogen), an anti-actin goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), an anti-FAS ligand mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences), an anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma), and an anti-c-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science). The reacted antibodies were treated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (GE Healthcare) and detected with the Western Lightning chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). An alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-conjugated anti-goat IgG secondary antibody (Sigma) in developing solution (8.25 mg of nitro blue tetrazolium, 2.1 mg of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphatase in 25 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 8.6) was used to detect actin. Densitometry analysis was performed using ImageJ (available on line). Detection of Cell Surface EMMPRIN by FACS Analysis— A431 cells that express MT1-MMP in a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible manner were used. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 3 days in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml doxycycline (Sigma). The cells were trypsinized, collected, and stained with an anti-EMMPRIN mAb (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). An Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) was used as a secondary antibody. The amount of cell-surface EMMPRIN was evaluated with a FACSCalibur cytofluorimeter (BD Biosciences). Temporary Knockdown of MT1-MMP and MT2-MMP by RNA Interference—Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the MT1-MMP and MT2-MMP mRNAs were designed and prepared by B-Bridge (Sunnyvale, CA), and transfection was carried out using the Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Thirty six hours after transfection, cells were cultured with serum-free medium in the presence or absence of 100 nm PMA for 8 h. Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and quantified at A260. An aliquot of the samples was reverse-transcribed, and mRNAs for MT1-MMP and MT2-MMP were measured by real time PCR using SYBR Green I (Molecular Applications, BioWhittaker, Rockland, ME) and the Smart cycler system (Takara Bio). The specific primer pairs used were 5′-TTGGACTGTCAGGAATGAGG-3′ and 5′-GCAGCACAAAATTCTCCGTG-3′ for MT1-MMP, 5′-TGAGCTAGAACCCTCTGT-3′ and 5′-GAGGCTAGTGGTGTGAGT-3′ for MT2-MMP, and 5′-AGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAAC-3′ and 5′-GACGGTGCCATGGAATTTGC-3′ for GAPDH. After initial denaturation (95 °C, 15 s), the PCRs were cycled 40 times with the following parameters: denaturation 95 °C, 1 s; annealing 65 °C, 4 s; and extension 72 °C, 6 s. Purification of EMMPRIN Fragments from the Culture Medium—A375-derived cells that express NF-EMMPRIN stably and MT1-MMP in a Dox-inducible manner were used to isolate the EMMPRIN fragments shed by MT1-MMP, and cells that express D1 stably were used to isolate the C-terminally FLAG-tagged EMMPRIN fragment containing N-terminal Ig-like domain. The cells (5 × 107) cultured in Dox-free induction medium were further cultured without serum for 72 h to obtain CM. The CM containing the FLAG-tagged EMMPRIN fragment was purified on an affinity column filled with agarose beads conjugated to an anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma). After washing with a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, 1.0 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4, the EMMPRIN fragment retained in the column was eluted with the FLAG peptide (200 μg/ml). Then the eluate was applied to a gel permeation column (Superdex 75 10/300 GL; GE Healthcare), and fractionation was carried out using an AKTA Explorer 10S (GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions containing the EMMPRIN fragment were collected, dialyzed against MilliQ water (Millipore), and freeze-dried. The purity of the EMMPRIN fragment was checked with SDS-PAGE and silver staining. The concentration of the fragment was determined by ELISA using an anti-EMMPRIN mAb and a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Deglycosylation was performed using N-glycosidase F (2 units/100 μl; Roche Applied Science) in a reaction buffer (200 mm Na2PO4, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.0) at 37 °C for 16 h. Determination of the C-terminal Amino Acid of the EMMPRIN Fragment by Mass Spectrometry—The purified NFEMMPRIN fragment was digested with 2 pmol of V8 peptidase (Roche Applied Science) in 25 μl of digestion buffer (25 mm ammonium carbonate, 5% acetonitrile, pH 7.8) for 18 h at 25 °C. The reaction mixture was applied to a C18 reverse-phase HPLC (HiQ-Sil C18-3; KYA Tech, Hachioji, Japan) and eluted by acetonitrile with a linear gradient from 5 to 90%. Each peak fraction was collected and applied to a sample plate (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with 1 μl of matrix solution and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (4700 Proteomics Analyzer, Applied Biosystems). Ions were then used to interrogate human protein sequences in the NCBInr data base using the MASCOT data base search algorithms (available on line). Digestion of the EMMPRIN Peptide by MT1-MMP in Vitro— An EMMPRIN peptide (89FLPEPMGTANIQLHGPPRVK108; 10 μm) was incubated with the catalytic fragment of human MT1-MMP (rMT1; 10 nm) (34Kajita M. Itoh Y. Chiba T. Mori H. Okada A. Kinoh H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) in a digestion buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5) in the presence or absence of 10 μm MMI270 (a synthetic hydroxamic MMP inhibitor, a kind gift from Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland). After incubation at 37 °C for 8 h, the digests were directly subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis. Induction of MMP-2 by the EMMPRIN Fragment in Normal Fibroblasts—Normal human fibroblast cells were cultured in a 24-well plate (5 × 104 cells/well) for 3 days. After the culture medium was changed to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing the purified EMMPRIN fragment (0, 0.1, 1.0, or 2.0 μg/ml), it was cultured for 24 or 72 h. The amount of MMP-2 in the CM was measured using an MMP-2 quantitative assay kit (Daiichi Fine Chemical) according to the instructions in the product manual. Immunoprecipitation—A431 cells (2 × 106 cells) expressing FLAG-tagged MT1-MMP were lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, protease inhibitor mixture set I (Calbiochem), pH 7.5) at 4 °C for 1 h. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected and incubated with anti-FLAG M2 mAb-conjugated agarose beads at 4 °C for 12 h. The beads were washed with lysis buffer four times, and the materials bound to the beads were eluted with lysis buffer containing 200 μg/ml FLAG peptide. The samples were then subjected to Western blot analysis. Immunocytochemistry and Immunohistochemistry—A431 cells expressing FLAG-tagged MT1-MMP were cultured on glass coverslips for 16 h in the presence of 10 μm MMI270 and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min. After a blocking step using 5% goat serum, 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS, the cells were treated with a rabbit anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (Sigma) or a mouse anti-EMMPRIN mAb. An Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and an Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) were used as secondary antibodies. The signals were analyzed with a confocal laser microscope (Bio-Rad). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of human ovarian carcinoma were kindly provided by Prof. Y. Okada at Keio University (Tokyo, Japan). Sections were deparaffinized and dehydrated. Endogenous peroxidase was quenched with 3% H2O2 in methanol for 15 min. The antigen was activated by microwaving it for 10 min in 10 mm citric acid, pH 6.0. Blocking was performed using a Histofine blocking kit (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan) for 10 min. Samples were treated with an anti-MT1-MMP mAb (222-1D8, a kind gift of Daiichi Fine Chemical) or anti-EMMPRIN mAb overnight at 4 °C. After three washes with PBS, biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins were used as secondary antibodies, and they were reacted with a horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin complex. Peroxidase activity was detected by a solution of diaminobenzidine containing H2O2 in a Tris-HCl buffer, which develops a brown color. Tumor Cells Shed EMMPRIN in an MMP-mediated Manner— EMMPRIN is expressed in most human tumor cell lines. We used three such cell lines for our study, the human fibrosarcoma line HT1080, the human epidermoid carcinoma line A431, and the human gastric carcinoma line TMK-1. We examined the expression of EMMPRIN in cell lysates and its shedding into the CM with Western blotting using anti-EMMPRIN pAb (Fig. 1). The cells were also treated with PMA, because PMA often stimulates the expression and activity of MMPs. All cell lines expressed EMMPRIN with a molecular mass between 44 and 66 kDa, as reported previously, and the peak of the distribution appeared to be at 58 kDa (Fig. 1, upper panels). A smaller 37-kDa band that presumably represents an intermediately glycosylated form (41Ellis S.M. Nabeshima K. Biswas C. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3385-3391PubMed Google Scholar) was also present. Stimulation of the cells with PMA did not affect the expression levels or the band patterns in the cells. EMMPRIN of almost the same size as the cellular form was detected in the CM (Fig. 1, lower panels). This is consistent with previous reports that the intact form of EMMPRIN is released into the CM, although PMA did not stimulate this shedding significantly. In addition to the intact form, a small 22-kDa fragment that had not been reported previously was also shed into the CM of HT1080 and A431 cells, but not TMK-1 cells. PMA treatment enhanced the shedding of the 22-kDa fragment from both cell types, and it was completely inhibited by a broad spectrum synthetic MMP inhibitor, MMI270. However, the shedding is not an immediate response to PMA treatment, because the 22-kDa fragment began to appear more than 4 h after stimulation (data not sown). The shedding pattern of TMK-1 cells was not affected by PMA treatment or by MMI270. Identification of the Protease Responsible for EMMPRIN Shedding—To characterize the protease(s) responsible for the EMMPRIN shedding, we tested the effects of the natural MMP inhibitors TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. TIMP-1 inhibits soluble MMPs and some disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs), but not membrane-type MT-MMPs, whereas TIMP-2 inhibits all MMPs, including MT-MMPs, but not most ADAMs. We treated A431 cells with PMA in the presence or absence of the inhibitors and examined the shedding of the 22-kDa fragment (Fig. 2A). Again, the 22-kDa EMMPRIN fragment was detected weakly in the CM, and its amount was enhanced by PMA. TIMP-2 inhibited the shedding effectively, but TIMP-1 showed almost no effect. MMI270 inhibited the shedding, as it did in the experiments shown in Fig. 1. Thus, the 22-kDa EMMPRIN fragment appears to be produced by the action of MT-MMPs, which are sensitive to TIMP-2 but not to TIMP-1. To test the effects of MT-MMPs on EMMPRIN shedding, each of six MT-MMPs was expressed as a FLAG-tagged form in COS-7 cells, and EMMPRIN was expressed as a Myc-tagged form (NM-EMMPRIN). Expression levels of MT-MMPs were confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 2B, lower panel). Although the expression levels of the MT-MMPs varied widely, with MT2-MMP and MT3-MMP expressed at much lower levels than the others, the 22-kDa EMMPRIN fragment was detected in the culture medium of cells that expressed either MT1-MMP or MT2-MMP (Fig. 2B, upper panel). Thus, at least MT1-MMP and MT2-MMP can induce the shedding of the 22-kDa EMMPRIN fragment. Then the cell lysate used for Fig. 1 was analyzed by Western blotting using either anti-MT1-MMP or anti-MT2-MMP. HT1080 and A431 cells but not TMK-1 cells expressed MT1-MMP (Fig. 2C). MT2-MMP was undetectable in all three cell lines (data not shown). Shedding of the 22-kDa fragment from the cell surface in the presence of MT1-MMP decreased the amount of cell-associated EMMPRIN, as analyzed by FACS analysis (Fig. 2D). A real time reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that mRNAs for both MT1-MMP and MT2-MMP were detectable in A431 cells and that their expression was increased about three times upon treatment of the cells with PMA (Fig. 3A). To evaluate the role of each MT-MMP on the EMMPRIN shedding, we performed knockdown experiments using siRNAs. The siRNA for MT1-MMP (siMT1) specifically reduced MT1-MMP mRNA by 80% and that for MT2-MMP (siMT2) specifically reduced the mRNA for MT2-MMP by 90% (Fig. 3A). An siRNA for the luciferase gene (siLuc) used as a control did not affect the MTMMP mRNA levels. We then tested the effect of the siRNAs on shedding from A431 cells stimulated with PMA. Down-regulation of MT1-MMP strongly inhibited shedding of the 22-kDa fragment (Fig. 3B, CM), and down-regulation of MT2-MMP slightly inhibited the shedding. Combining the siRNAs for MT1-MMP and MT2-MMP reduced the level more efficiently (Fi"

Recently we have shown that overexpression of the transcription factor SOX9 greatly enhanced re-expression of the phenotype in three-dimensional aggregate cultures. Here we show that endogenous SOX9 mRNA can be rapidly up-regulated in subcultured human articular chondrocytes if grown in alginate, in monolayer with cytochalasin D, or with specific inhibition of the RhoA effector kinases ROCK1 and -2, which all prevent actin stress fiber formation. Disruption of actin stress fibers using any of these redifferentiation stimuli also supported the superinduction of SOX9 by cycloheximide. The superinduction was blocked by inhibitors of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway and involved the stabilization of SOX9 mRNA. Furthermore stimulation of chondrocyte p38 MAPK activity with interleukin-1β resulted in increased levels of SOX9 mRNA, and this was again dependent on the absence of actin stress fibers in the cells. In this study of chondrocyte redifferentiation we have provided further evidence of the early involvement of SOX9 and have discovered a novel post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism activated by p38 MAPK, which stabilized SOX9 mRNA.

Articular chondrocytes are the only cell type found within articular cartilage and are responsible for the formation and maintenance of the specialized extracellular matrix of the tissue. Isolation of these cells and culture in monolayer dramatically alters their differentiation state. They change from a phenotype expressing COL2A1 (encoding collagen type II α1) to one expressing COL1A1 (encoding collagen type I α1) and switch from a rounded to a fibroblastic morphology. During early passages in monolayer culture, chondrocytes are able to re-express their COL2A1 phenotype if placed in a culture that promotes a round cell shape (1Benya P.D. Shaffer J.D. Cell. 1982; 30: 215-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar) or in a high density cell aggregate culture (2Jakob M. Demarteau O. Schafer D. Hintermann B. Dick W. Heberer M. Martin I. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 368-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The transcription factor SOX9, which plays a major role in the regulation of COL2A1 gene expression, has been shown to be involved in this redifferentiation process (3Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R.

Regulation of SOX9 gene expression has been extensively studied in developmental systems, yet precise mechanisms that control it are elusive.

However, analysis of promoter activity is complicated by the presence of several regulatory regions extending at least a megabase both upstream and downstream of the SOX9 locus (12Bagheri-Fam S.

The organization of the chondrocyte cytoskeleton is clearly of importance in the full expression of chondrocyte phenotype, and this may be regulated by many interacting signaling pathways. The p38 MAPK is a stress-activated protein kinase related to JNK and is able to transduce a variety of stress and physiological signals into transcriptional regulation (15Zarubin T. Han J. Cell Res. 2005; 15: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). Such stress signals include the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, which can lead to superinduction of genes by p38 MAPK-dependent mechanisms (16Hershko D.D. Robb B.W. Wray C.J. Luo G.J. Hasselgren P.O. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 91: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Itani O.A. Cornish K.L. Liu K.Z. Thomas C.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F778-F787Google Scholar). In chondrocytes, cytokines such as IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor α signal through the p38 MAPK pathway (18Geng Y. Valbracht J. Lotz M. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 2425-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and this contributes to their metabolic and catabolic effects (19Studer R.K. Bergman R. Stubbs T. Decker K. Arthritis Res.

Furthermore p38 MAPK signaling has been implicated in the maturation of chondrocytes in the endochondral growth plate during development (21Stanton L.A. Sabari S. Sampaio A.V. Underhill T.M. Beier F. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This activation of p38 MAPK can be opposed by the activity of the RhoA small GTPase, which prevents chondrocyte maturation (22Wang G. Woods A. Sabari S. Pagnotta L. Stanton L.A. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13205-13214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). RhoA is an important regulator of cytoskeletal structure and focal adhesion maturation (23Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). Its activity promotes the formation of actin stress fibers through downstream effector kinases such as ROCK1 and -2. These act by both increasing tension within the cell through direct phosphorylation of myosin II regulatory light chain (24Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K.

Recent studies have shown that prevention of actin stress fiber formation achieved through inhibition of RhoA signaling leads to increased levels of SOX9 mRNA and protein in chondrocytic cells (26Woods A. Wang G. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11626-11634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Cell Isolation and Culture—Human articular cartilage was obtained with fully informed consent and ethical approval within 18 h of surgery from total knee arthroplasties (6Li Y. Tew S.R. Russell A.M.

Chondrocytes were isolated following sequential trypsin/collagenase digestion and cultured at 37 °C in monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (all from Cambrex, Wokingham, UK). Experiments were with cells at the end of the second or third passage (with a 1:2 split ratio). Alginate bead cultures were established as described previously (6Li Y. Tew S.R. Russell A.M. Gonzalez K. Hardingham T.E. Hawkins R.E. Tissue Eng. 2004; 10: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Specific inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide unless otherwise stated. Cycloheximide (5 μg/ml in ethanol), Y27632 ROCK inhibitor (10 μm in water), SP600125 JNK inhibitor (25 μm), and actinomycin D (1 μm) were all obtained from Calbiochem. Cytochalasin D (1 μm) and SB202190 p38 MAPK inhibitor (20 μm) were obtained from Sigma. Final concentrations of carrier solvents were equal under all experimental conditions. Cells treated with IL-1β (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK) were in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Examination of Cytoskeleton in Monolayer and Alginate Chondrocyte Cultures—Monolayer cultures grown on 8-chamber LabTek II glass slides (Nalge Nunc International, Hereford, UK) were fixed for 10 min at 4 °C with formaldehyde, permeabilized in Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min and then blocked in Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. F-actin was stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (50 μl of 5 units/ml) (Invitrogen) for 30 min. After counterstaining of cell nuclei for 1 min with 300 nm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and then washing in Tris-buffered saline the cells were mounted under a glass coverslip using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK). Alginate beads were blocked, permeabilized, and stained as described above but with the reagents supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 to prevent depolymerization of the alginate. After the final wash step, the stained beads were placed within microcavity slides, soaked with Vectashield, and gently crushed under a glass coverslip. Fluorescence localization was analyzed using a Leica SP2 confocal microscope. Gene Expression Analysis—Real time PCR was used to examine expression of SOX9 in the chondrocyte cultures. Total RNA was prepared from cell monolayers in 12-well culture plates using 1 ml of TRI reagent (Sigma) per well. Alginate beads were crushed in TRI reagent, and total RNA was extracted into an aqueous phase after the addition of chloroform. This aqueous phase was then passed through a GenElute RNA purification kit (Sigma). cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and primed with random hexamer oligonucleotides (Promega, Southampton, UK) in a 25-μl reaction. Amplification by PCR was carried out in 25-μl reaction volumes on an MJ Research Opticon 2 using reagents from a real time PCR probe core kit with gene-specific primers and TaqMan probes (all from Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). GAPDH primers and probe have been described previously (27Martin I. Jakob M. Schafer D. Dick W. Spagnoli G. Heberer M. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: 112-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Primers and probe for SOX9 were designed using Applied Biosystems Primer Express software and had the following sequences: Forward 5′-3′, CCCCAACAGATCGCCTACAG; Reverse 5′-3′, GAGTTCTGGTCGGTGTAGTC; and Probe 5′-3′, CGCCCATCACCCGCTCACAGTA. The final concentration for all primers was 300 nm and for probes was 100 nm. Relative expression levels were normalized to GAPDH and calculated using the 2-ΔCt method (28Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124899) Google Scholar). Prior validation had established that both GAPDH and SOX9 PCRs proceeded with a similar efficiency. For determination of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) gene expression, SYBR Green detection was used, and values were normalized using GAPDH. MMP-13 primers were as follows: Forward 5′-3′, TGTTGCTGTACAAAAGCAATGGTT; and Reverse, 5′-3′ TGCTCTCATTGACAGACCATGTG. For the mRNA decay experiment, SOX9 mRNA copy number in each sample was calculated using a calibration curve created from known dilutions of the pcDNA3SOX9_UT_FLAG vector, a kind gift from Professor Benoit de Crombrugghe, Houston, TX (3Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Copy numbers were then normalized to input RNA concentrations, which were measured on a GeneQuant II spectrophotometer. Western Blot Analysis of Cell Extracts—The culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline before being extracted in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue) with the aid of a cell scraper. Samples were heated at 80 °C for 10 min under reducing conditions (50 mm dithiothreitol) and run on Novex 4-12% SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen). The separated proteins were then blotted onto Biotrace NT nitrocellulose membranes (Pall Corp., Ann Arbor, MI) and probed with the following antibodies: anti-p38 (catalog number 9212), anti-p38 phospho-Thr180/Tyr182 (catalog number 9211), anti-phospho-MAPKAPK2 (catalog number 3041), anti-c-Jun (catalog number 9165), or anti-phospho-c-Jun Ser73 (catalog number 9164). All antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (Danvers, MA), and the manufacturer's own probing protocol was used. Primary antibody binding was localized using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (catalog number 7074, Cell Signaling Technologies) and developed using chemiluminescence (Western Lightning Plus, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Gene Sequence Analysis of SOX9 3′-Untranslated Region (UTR)—SOX9 3′-UTR sequence was obtained in three ways. First, the sequences of the 3′-UTR of human (accession number NM_000346), mouse (accession number NM_011448), Xenopus (accession number NM_001016853), and rainbow trout (accession number AF209872) SOX9 mRNA were obtained from the GenBank™ data base. Second, sequences 3′ of the SOX9 coding region were identified for rat and dog (each with 80-90% identity to human sequence) from genomic sequence aligned using the University of California Santa Cruz Genome Browser. Finally BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) searches of expressed sequence tag data bases using human SOX9 3′-UTR sequences were able to identify highly conserved (>81-91% similarity) cow (accession numbers CB437176 and CO896800) and horse (accession numbers CX603491 and CX604580) sequences. All known and putative SOX9 3′-UTRs were aligned with human SOX9 3′-UTR using ClustalW, and conserved AU-rich elements (AUUUA) were identified. The loss of SOX9 expression is a major factor causing the change in chondrocyte phenotype in monolayer culture (4Stokes D.G. Liu G. Dharmavaram R. Hawkins D. Piera-Velazquez S. Jimenez S.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In this study there was a striking decrease in SOX9 gene expression in the human articular chondrocytes in monolayer culture (Fig. 1A). Cells at the end of passage 2 (P2) had 10-fold lower levels of SOX9 mRNA than cells freshly isolated from tissue (P0). Many redifferentiation strategies for monolayer expanded articular chondrocytes have been described (1Benya P.D. Shaffer J.D. Cell. 1982; 30: 215-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar, 2Jakob M. Demarteau O. Schafer D. Hintermann B. Dick W. Heberer M. Martin I. J. Cell.

Physiol. 2004; 199: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Typically these have included inducing a rounded cell morphology, such as in alginate or cell aggregate culture, and these strategies have been shown to lead to increased expression of target genes of SOX9 including cartilage-specific extracellular matrix proteins. We investigated the early response of chondrocytes to alginate bead culture, which induced cell rounding. The change in cytoskeletal organization was assessed by determining the actin distribution with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Fig. 1B). In monolayer the human articular chondrocytes showed characteristic F-actin stress fibers across the cell. In contrast confocal images of articular chondrocytes after 72 h in alginate revealed a cortical distribution of F-actin and an absence of stress fibers. Analysis of SOX9 gene expression using real time PCR (Fig. 1C) showed that in alginate there was a 5-fold increase in SOX9 mRNA at 72 h. From this experiment, it was clear that cell rounding and/or disruption of actin stress fibers led to an increase in SOX9 gene expression during the early stages of articular chondrocyte redifferentiation in alginate. To determine whether cell rounding was an important aspect controlling the increase in SOX9 we determined SOX9 expression in human articular chondrocytes in monolayer cultured (a) with cytochalasin D (CytD), which prevents actin polymerization, or (b) with Y27632, an inhibitor of the RhoA effector kinases ROCK1 and -2, which are important in the signaling processes that control the formation of actin stress fibers. Therefore both agents inhibit the formation of actin stress fibers but by separate mechanisms. Imaging of the cells after 72 h (Fig. 2) showed that untreated controls contained large stress fiber bundles. CytD treatment (0.1 μm) caused a slight retraction of the cells, but actin stress fibers were still present. However, at 1 μm CytD many of the cells were fully retracted into a rounded shape, and at 10 μm CytD all cells had a round shape, and no actin stress fibers were visible. Specific inhibition of RhoA signaling using Y27632 had little affect at 1 μm, but at 10 μm the cells assumed a thin elongated morphology with an absence of actin stress fibers. At 100 μm Y27632 in addition to the absence of actin stress fibers there was also cell rounding. Both CytD and Y27632 caused significant increases in SOX9 gene expression at their two higher concentrations, and this corresponded with a complete loss of actin stress fibers in each case. The results with Y27632 suggested that the rounding up of the cell was less important than the loss of actin stress fibers. It seems likely therefore that prevention of actin stress fiber formation plays an important role in controlling SOX9 gene expression levels during the early stages of redifferentiation of cultured mature chondrocytes.FIGURE 2Inhibition of stress fibers in human articular chondrocytes causes up-regulation of SOX9.

In control cultures the time course showed that SOX9 was increased almost 5-fold as early as 24 h after the formation of the alginate beads. The addition of CHX had a surprising inductive effect on SOX9 mRNA, which rose almost 20-fold higher after 48 h. In contrast with the chondrocytes in monolayer culture with CHX (Fig. 3B) there was no induction of SOX9 over 24 h. However, if there was additional disruption of actin with CytD, or Y27632, then SOX9 mRNA was increased almost 4-fold by CHX. These results provided evidence of another mechanism for increasing SOX9 mRNA levels in articular chondrocytes that was triggered by CHX but only occurred in the absence of ROCK-dependent actin structures. To further define the mechanism by which CHX increased SOX9 mRNA, we tested whether it was sensitive to the inhibition of signaling through the stress-activated protein kinase pathways p38 MAPK and JNK, which CHX is known to activate (32Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Gotoh Y. Iwamatsu A. Irie K. Mori E. Kuroyanagi N. Hagiwara M. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26981-26988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 33Newton R. Stevens D.A. Hart L.A. Lindsay M. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To disrupt stress fibers in monolayer cultures treated with CHX, Y27632 was chosen rather than CytD because of its greater specificity to those actin structures. Preliminary experiments showed that increases in SOX9 mRNA were easily detected at 5 h, and this short time was chosen for further experiments as it reduced the risk of cell toxicity that might be caused by multiple signaling pathway inhibitors over longer treatment. In control cultures analysis of cell extracts revealed higher levels of activated phospho-p38 MAPK in the presence of CHX (Fig. 4A) as well as increased c-Jun phosphorylation, which confirmed that CHX caused both p38 MAPK and JNK activation. The ROCK inhibitor Y27632 increased further the p38 MAPK activation but decreased c-Jun phosphorylation. Therefore inhibition of the RhoA signaling pathway shifted the CHX-induced stress response toward increased p38 MAPK signaling. Inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway by SB202190 and of the JNK pathway by SP600125 was used to probe further the involvement of these distinct pathways in SOX9 superinduction. Incubation with SB202190 was found to prevent increased CHX/Y27632-induced phosphorylation of the p38 MAPK target MAPKAPK2, and SP600125 inhibited c-Jun phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). SOX9 showed a 6-fold superinduction at 5 h in cells treated with both CHX and Y27632, but this was completely abolished in the presence of the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 (Fig. 4C), and this result was confirmed with another p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580 (data not shown). In contrast, inhibition of JNK with SP600125 had no effect on SOX9 superinduction (Fig. 4C). The results thus showed that CHX superinduction of SOX9 was p38 MAPK-dependent. To confirm whether CHX stimulation of SOX9 in alginate culture also involved p38 MAPK, the effects of these inhibitors were tested on alginate cultures. The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 strongly inhibited the CHX-mediated increase of SOX9 mRNA in alginate. However, the experiment also showed no inhibition of the increased expression caused by the alginate culture itself (Fig. 4D). The JNK inhibitor SP600125 had no effect on SOX9 levels in any alginate culture conditions. JNK signaling was therefore not involved. The inhibition of stress-activated protein kinases in these experiments showed that activation of p38 MAPK, but not JNK, was necessary for the up-regulation of SOX9 mRNA in CHX-treated human articular chondrocytes. Additionally the inhibition of actin stress fiber formation was an essential part of the action of p38 MAPK. It was also noted that because neither of these stress-activated protein kinase pathway inhibitors affected the up-regulation of SOX9 caused purely by cell rounding in alginate this was independent of p38 MAPK and JNK activation. Superinduction of gene expression by CHX can be caused by increased transcription or increased mRNA stability (16Hershko D.D. Robb B.W. Wray C.J. Luo G.J. Hasselgren P.O. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 91: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Itani O.A. Cornish K.L. Liu K.Z. Thomas C.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F778-F787Google Scholar). We investigated the stability of SOX9 mRNA in CHX/Y27632-treated monolayer cultures using actinomycin D to inhibit transcription. The stability of SOX9 mRNA was found to be much greater in CHX/Y27632-treated cultures (half-life, 3.1 h) than in controls (half-life, 1.8 h) (Fig. 5). Furthermore co-incubation of cells with CHX/Y27632/SB202190 significantly reduced the SOX9 mRNA stabilization (half-life, 2.4 h) demonstrating that p38 MAPK signaling was involved in the mechanism. A similar analysis of actinomycin D-treated alginate cultures also provided evidence of SOX9 mRNA stabilization in CHX superinduction (data not shown). Therefore, the results suggested that SOX9 mRNA stabilization was likely to be a major cause of the p38 MAPK-mediated increase in SOX9 mRNA induced by CHX/Y27632. The stability of mRNA has been shown to be greatly influenced by the presence of AU-rich elements (AREs) in their 3′-UTRs. Data base analysis of human SOX9 3′-UTRs revealed eight AUUUA motifs, five of which were conserved in the 3′-UTR of rat, mouse, and dog SOX9 (Table 1). All the conserved motifs were among very well conserved AU-rich sequences (between 73 and 85% AU content of the 40 bp surrounding the central uracil of each motif), and two of them also form part of a defined UUAUUUA(U/A)(U/A) minimal destabilizing sequence (34Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). From the sequence available we found that the latter motifs and two other motifs were conserved in cow and horse expressed sequence tags. No comparable conserved sequences were found in Xenopus and rainbow trout SOX9 3′-UTRs. The results showed that mammalian SOX9 3′-UTRs contained well conserved elements that could render the mRNA susceptible to 3′-ARE-dependent mRNA stabilization signals.TABLE 1Gene sequence analysis of 3′-AREs in mammalian SOX9 3′-untranslated region Positions of AUUUA motifs were identified in human SOX9 mRNA (accession number NM_000346). These motifs are shown with 18 bp of both upstream and downstream sequence, and AU content shown is based on this additional sequence.

https://openalex.org/W2139299569,"The Andromeda galaxy (Messier 31) is big in galaxy evolution studies, since it is the nearest giant spiral galaxy, and one of the largest in the Local Group. It also looks odd, and its appearance has long puzzled astronomers. It has a well known outer ring offset from the galactic nucleus, and the outer disk is warped. Now an offset inner dust ring has been discovered in infrared images from the Spitzer Space Telescope. Numerical simulations indicate that both rings formed when a companion galaxy plunged almost head-on through the disk of M31. The most likely interloper is the dwarf galaxy M32. This paper reports the presence of a second, inner ring offset by half a kiloparsec from the centre of the Andromeda galaxy. Numerical simulations indicate that both rings result from a companion galaxy plunging head-on through the centre of the disk of M31. The unusual morphology of the Andromeda galaxy (Messier 31, the closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way) has long been an enigma. Although regarded for decades as showing little evidence of a violent history, M31 has a well-known1,2,3,4,5,6,7 outer ring of star formation at a radius of ten kiloparsecs whose centre is offset from the galaxy nucleus. In addition, the outer galaxy disk is warped, as seen at both optical8 and radio9 wavelengths. The halo contains numerous loops and ripples. Here we report the presence of a second, inner dust ring with projected dimensions of 1.5 × 1 kiloparsecs and offset by about half a kiloparsec from the centre of the galaxy (based upon an analysis of previously-obtained data10). The two rings appear to be density waves propagating in the disk. Numerical simulations indicate that both rings result from a companion galaxy plunging through the centre of the disk of M31. The most likely interloper is M32. Head-on collisions between galaxies are rare, but it appears nonetheless that one took place 210 million years ago in our Local Group of galaxies."
https://openalex.org/W1983457228,"Disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis precedes the neurodegeneration that occurs in Alzheimer disease (AD). Of the many neuronal calcium-regulating proteins, we focused on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident ryanodine receptors (RyRs) because they are increased in the hippocampus of mice expressing mutant presenilin-1 and are associated with neurotoxicity. Others have observed that ryanodine binding is elevated in human postmortem hippocampal regions suggesting that RyR(s) are involved in AD pathogenesis. Here we report that extracellular amyloid-β(Aβ)-(1-42) specifically increased RyR-3, but not RyR-1 or RyR-2, gene expression in cortical neurons from C57Bl6 mice. Furthermore, endogenously produced Aβ-(1-42) increased RyR-3 mRNA and protein in cortical neurons from transgenic (Tg)CRND8 mice, a mouse model of AD. Increased RyR-3 mRNA and protein was also observed in brain tissue from 4- to 4.5-month-old Tg animals compared with non-Tg littermate controls. In experiments performed in nominal extracellular calcium, neurons from Tg mice had significant increases in intracellular calcium following ryanodine or glutamate treatment compared with littermate controls, which was abolished by treatment with small interfering RNA directed to RyR-3, indicating that the higher levels of calcium originated from RyR-3-regulated stores. Taken together, these observations suggest that Aβ-(1-42)-mediated changes in intracellular calcium homeostasis is regulated in part through a direct increase of RyR-3 expression and function. Disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis precedes the neurodegeneration that occurs in Alzheimer disease (AD).

Fastbom J. Cowburn R.F. Bonkale W. Ohm T.G. Ravid R. Sorrentino V. O'Neill C. Neuroscience. 1999; 92: 499-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although the cause of AD is still unknown, it is believed that accumulation of Aβ in the brain is an initial pathogenic event (2Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (10962) Google Scholar). Aβ-(1-42) is a fibrillogenic peptide resulting from the sequential endoproteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein by β- and γ-secretase, and its overproduction and deposition are associated with early-onset (or familial) and sporadic AD (3Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11039-11041Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Consequently, there is an extensive effort to determine the molecular and cellular actions of Aβ on neurons and glial cells. Alterations in intracellular calcium (Ca2+i) homeostasis constitute an early signaling event that initiates the manifestation of AD (4LaFerla F.M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 862-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Ca2+i levels are maintained by voltage-, ligand-gated, or store-operated Ca2+ channels on the plasmalemma and by endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident channels (5Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). Several studies have indicated that disruption of ER-regulated Ca2+i homeostasis is associated with neurotoxicity in AD (6O'Neill C. Cowburn R.F. Bonkale W.L. Ohm T.G. Fastbom J. Carmody M. Kelliher M. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2001; 67: 177-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The ER is an important dynamic Ca2+ source and sink, it regulates neurotransmitter release, synaptic plasticity, gene expression, and signal transduction to the nucleus (7Verkhratsky A. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) are the two major Ca2+ release channels found on the ER (8Sorrentino V. Rizzuto R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 459-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and are activated through Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release and IP3-induced Ca2+ release, respectively (9Mattson M.P. LaFerla F.M. Chan S.L. Leissring M.A. Shepel P.N. Geiger J.D. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 222-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Our study focuses on the role of RyRs in the regulation of Ca2+i homeostasis because others have observed that hippocampal brain specimens from AD patients with early cognitive decline have increased ryanodine binding, suggestive of increased RyR levels (1Kelliher M. Fastbom J. Cowburn R.F. Bonkale W. Ohm T.G. Ravid R. Sorrentino V. O'Neill C. Neuroscience. 1999; 92: 499-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We observed that RyR expression and function were increased in neurons that expressed mutant PS-1 (10Chan S.L. Mayne M. Holden C.P. Geiger J.D. Mattson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18195-18200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Furthermore, high levels of RyRs mediated dysregulation of Ca2+i in cortical neurons from other mouse models of AD (11Lee S.Y. Hwang D.Y. Kim Y.K. Lee J.W. Shin I.C. Oh K.W. Lee M.K. Lim J.S. Yoon do Y. Hwang S.J. Hong J.T. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 151-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13Smith I.F. Hitt B. Green K.N. Oddo S. LaFerla F.M. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 1711-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In brain, RyRs are concentrated in postsynaptic neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, where they regulate Ca2+i levels, membrane potential, and second messenger systems. Three isoforms of RyRs have been identified as follows: type-1, which is found in skeletal muscle; type-2, which is concentrated in the heart; and type-3, which is concentrated in hippocampus (14Giannini G. Conti A. Mammarella S. Scrobogna M. Sorrentino V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), cerebral cortex, and corpus striatum (15Ogawa Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 229-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). All isoforms exist in brain, where RyR-2 is the most abundant, but previous studies give no indication as to which isoform is important in the dysregulation of Ca2+i homeostasis in AD neurons. The way Aβ regulates the expression and function of the machinery that mediates disruption of Ca2+i homeostasis in AD remains unclear. Here we report that high levels of Aβ-(1- 42) selectively elevated RyR-3 mRNA and protein levels in vitro and in vivo. Functionally, increased RyR-3 facilitated significant increases in Ca2+i levels following ryanodine or glutamate treatment. These observations highlight a possible role for RyR-3 in the AD pathology. Animals and Neuronal Cultures—APP695 (KM670/671NL+V717F) transgenic (Tg) CRND8 mice were a gift from Dr. David Westaway (University of Toronto) and have been described previously to exhibit Aβ plaques and cognitive defects by 3 months of age (16Chishti M.A. Yang D.S. Janus C. Phinney A.L. Horne P. Pearson J. Strome R. Zuker N. Loukides J. French J. Turner S. Lozza G. Grilli M. Kunicki S. Morissette C. Paquette J. Gervais F. Bergeron C. Fraser P.E. Carlson G.A.

Timed pregnant C57Bl6 mice were obtained from the animal housing facility at the University of Manitoba. Cerebral cortices were dissected from embryonic day 16 C57Bl6 or CRND8 (non-Tg or Tg) fetuses and used for primary culture of cortical neurons as described previously (10Chan S.L. Mayne M. Holden C.P. Geiger J.D. Mattson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18195-18200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). CRND8 fetuses were genotyped for the APP695 double mutation by real time PCR (Platinum TaqDNA polymerase; Invitrogen) before cell dissociation and tissue pooling. The sequences of primers used for double mutant APP695 were as follows: 5′ TGT CCA AGA TGC AGC AGA ACG GCT ACG AAAA and 3′ AGA AAT GAA GAA ACG CCA AGC GCC GTG ACT. PCR products were generated by 30 cycles of 94/68/72 °C. PCR product levels were determined during each cycle by SYBR-Green I (1/10,000 dilution; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) using iCycler iQ real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Non-Tg and TgCRND8 cortical tissues were pooled separately and seeded at 8 × 105 cells per well onto poly-d-lysine (Sigma)-coated 6-well culture plates, 6.5 × 105 cells per 40-mm glass coverslips for Ca2+ imaging experiments, or 8 × 105 cells per 25-mm glass coverslips for immunofluorescence assay. CRND8 cortical neurons were maintained as above. Experiments were performed on C57Bl6 primary cortical neurons following 8 days of in vitro culture. Experiments conducted on non-Tg or TgCRND8 cultures were completed following 5 days of in vitro culture to ensure high viability of Tg neurons. Cultures were ∼80% MAP-2 (Chemicon, Sunnyville, CA)-positive neurons and 20% were glial fibrillary acidic protein (Abcam, Cambridge, MA)-positive astrocytes by immunofluorescence assay (data not shown). Aβ Treatments of Primary Cortical Neurons—Aβ-(25-35), Aβ-(35-25), Aβ-(1-40), Aβ-(1-42), and Aβ-(42-1) peptides (Bachem, Torrance, CA) were prepared as 200 μm stocks in Locke's buffer containing 154 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm NaHCO3, 5.6 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 5 mm HEPES, and 2.3 mm CaCl2 (Fisher), pH 7.2, and incubated at 37 °C (5% CO2 atmosphere) 24 h prior to use. C57Bl6 neurons were incubated with 1000 nm of Aβ-(25-35), Aβ-(35-25), Aβ-(1-40), Aβ-(1- 42), or Aβ-(42-1) peptide for 18 h or with 100 or 1000 nm ionomycin (Sigma) for 30 min in conditioned media. Non-Tg and TgCRND8 primary cortical neurons were incubated with 1000 nm of Aβ-(1-40), Aβ-(1-42), and Aβ-(42-1), peptide or 1.3 μg/ml Aβ-(1-42) antibody (rabbit polyclonal IgG) (BIOSOURCE) or as a negative control 1.3 μg/ml gp-116 (HHV-6) antibody (mouse monoclonal IgG) (Advanced Biotechnologies, Inc., Columbia, MD) for 18 h. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was purified from 8 × 105 neurons or a small cortical section of the right hemisphere of the brain (∼10 mg) from non-Tg and TgCRND8 mice using the GenElute Total Mammalian RNA isolation kit (Sigma). RT-PCR amplification of RyR-1 and RyR-3 mRNA was conducted as outlined previously (10Chan S.L. Mayne M. Holden C.P. Geiger J.D. Mattson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18195-18200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). PCR amplification of RyR-2 mRNA was conducted using primers 5′ GAA TCA GTG AGT TAC TGG GCA TGG and 3′ CTG GTC TCT GAG TTC TCC AAA AGC, yielding a product of 650 bp. RyR-2 PCR products were generated by 35 cycles of 94/53/72 °C. IP3R-1 levels were determined using 5′ TCA TGG AAA GCA GAC ACG AT and 3′ CCG CTC TGT GGT GTA ATA TA yielding a PCR product of 404 bp, generated by 30 cycles of 94/54/72 °C. SERCA-2b levels were determined using 5′ GGG AGT GGG GCA GTG GCA GC and 3′ CGT CTC TCT GGG CTG AGG GG yielding a PCR product of 350 bp, generated by 30 cycles of 94/62/72 °C. β-Actin levels were determined using 5′ ATG GAT GAC GAT ATC GCT GC and 3′ CGT ACA TGG CTG GGG TGT TG primers that yielded a PCR product of 399 bp, generated by 25 cycles of 94/53/72 °C. Alignment analysis of each primer was conducted to ensure that they were gene- and isoform-specific. Densitometric analysis of RT-PCR products was performed using NIH Image software, version 1.60. RyR pixel density levels were normalized to β-actin levels and are depicted as fold changes, where the untreated condition is considered 1-fold. Western Blot Analysis—Non-Tg and TgCRND8 brains were harvested from 4- to 4.5-month-old mice (16-18 weeks) sacrificed by intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg pentobarbital (Bimeda-MTC Animal Health Inc., Cambridge, Ontario, Canada) followed by decapitation. Whole brains were dissected on ice into cerebellar, cortical, hippocampal, and basal regions (the remainder of tissue after the removal of the cortex, hippocampus, and brain stem). Tissue was immediately homogenized on ice with 400 μl of lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPS, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol (Fisher) and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Samples were incubated on ice for 1 h and then centrifuged at 950 × g to pellet insoluble proteins. 125 μg of supernatant was loaded onto a 3-8% Tris acetate NuPAGE® gradient gel (Invitrogen) and transferred under reducing conditions onto 0.4 μm polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Fisher) on ice for 24 h at 20 V. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBS for 1 h at room temperature and incubated in blocking buffer with 1/1000 dilution of RyR-1, -2, or -3 antibodies overnight at 4 °C (isoform-specific RyR rabbit polyclonal antibodies were a gift from Dr. V. Sorrentino, University of Siena, Italy). The same membranes were probed for actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). RyR pixel density levels were normalized to actin levels and are depicted as fold changes, where the untreated condition is considered 1-fold. Immunofluorescence Analysis—Non-TgCRND8 neurons seeded at 8 × 105 on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips were treated with 1000 nm Aβ-(1-42) for 24 h on in vitro day 4 to elevate RyR expression. Non-Tg and TgCRND8 cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Fisher) in phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma) on in vitro day 5 at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 12 min and permeabilized with HEPES/Triton buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 300 mm sucrose, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Triton X-100 (Fisher) for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked with 5% goat serum (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with 1/1000 dilution of RyR-1, -2, and -3 antibodies (17Rossi D. Simeoni I. Micheli M. Bootman M. Lipp P. Allen P.D. Sorrentino V. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2497-2504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Neurons were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies at 1/1000 dilution (Molecular Probes), and nuclei were stained using Hoechst 33342 (Sigma). Neurons were imaged using an Axioskop 2 plus (Carl Zeiss Canada, Ltd.) with Axiovision Release 4.2 software. For detection of RyRs, all images were exposed for 260 ms under fluorescein isothiocyanate. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Design and Delivery—siRNAs were generated using the Dicer siRNA generation kit (Genelantis, San Diego) and were based on the rabbit RyR-3 mRNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number X68650). The region of the RyR-3 mRNA chosen showed 88% alignment with mouse RyR-3, 9.6% with mouse RyR-2, and 0% with mouse RyR-1 after BLAST analysis. Primers used to amplify RyR-3 from plasmid for diced siRNA generation were specific to mouse and rabbit RyR-3 as determined by alignment analysis. Tg neurons seeded at 8 × 105 per well in 6-well plates were transfected with 200 ng of siRyR-3 or nonspecific control siRNA (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) using 3 μl of GeneSilencer® siRNA transfection reagent (Genelantis) per ml of conditioned media for 24 h. Gene silencing was confirmed 72 h post-transfection by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis as described previously. Transfection efficiency was determined using 1 μg of AlexaFluor 546®-labeled nonspecific siRNA (Qiagen) and calculated as the number of nuclei localized with siRNA ÷ total number of nuclei × 100%. Measurement of Free Intracellular Calcium—Free intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+i) levels were quantified using fluorescence ratio microscopy as described elsewhere (10Chan S.L. Mayne M. Holden C.P. Geiger J.D. Mattson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18195-18200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), using the Ca2+ indicator dye Fura-2 (Molecular Probes). Fura-2 bound to Ca2+, an indication of free Ca2+ levels, and was excited at 340 nm, and unbound Fura-2 was excited at 380 nm. Ca2+i levels are depicted as a ratio of 340/380 nm emission at 510 nm. Briefly, 6 × 105 cells were loaded for 30 min with 1 μg/ml of acetoxymethyl ester (AM) Fura-2 in Locke's buffer. Cells were imaged on an inverted Zeiss microscope using a CoolSnapHQ (Roper Scientific Inc., Trenton, NJ) camera with a 40× oil objective lens. Changes in Ca2+i levels were determined using Stallion Imaging software (Downingtown, PA). l-(+)-glutamic acid (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ) was converted to 1 m stock of glutamate by addition of 10 n NaOH (Fisher) to pH 7.2. Ryanodine (Sigma) was prepared as a stock solution of 50 mm in 100% Me2SO (Sigma). Treatments were delivered to neurons by perfusion. Experiments were performed in nominal extracellular Ca2+ (Locke's buffer without CaCl2). Each experiment was repeated at least three separate times, 15-30 cells imaged at each time. Of the cells imaged, data were pooled from cells that responded to both glutamate and ryanodine. Statistical Analysis—Densitometric analysis was performed using NIH Scion Image software, version 1.60. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism, version 3.02 (San Diego, CA). One-way ANOVA with Student-Newman-Keuls post-test was performed to determine the difference between means after treatment. Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test was used to determine the difference between genotypes and treatments and the possible interactions of each. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Aβ-induced RyR-3 mRNA Expression in Primary Cortical Neurons—To test the hypothesis that Aβ directly increased RyR mRNA levels, C57Bl6 cortical neurons were treated with Aβ-(1-42) peptide (1000 nm) for 18 h and analyzed for RyR mRNA levels (Fig. 1A). As determined by RT-PCR, C57Bl6 primary cortical cells incubated with 1000 nm Aβ-(1-42) increased RyR-3 mRNA levels 3.5 ± 1.38-fold S.E. (n = 4, p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA, Student-Newman-Keuls post-test). Although not statistically significant, RyR-1 mRNA increased ∼2.4 ± 0.84-fold S.E. Treatment with Aβ-(25-35), Aβ-(35- 25), Aβ-(1-40), and Aβ-(42-1) peptides did not alter RyR gene expression in primary cortical neurons from C57Bl6 (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, identical treatments did not alter RyR-2, IP3R-1, or SERCA-2b mRNA levels (not shown). To rule out the involvement of rapid increases in Ca2+i in the up-regulation of RyR gene expression, we treated C57Bl6 primary cortical neurons with an ionophore, ionomycin, for 30 min. The treatment was removed and replaced with conditioned media for 18 h at 37 °C. Consistent with the observations made in a previous study (18Genazzani A.A. Carafoli E. Guerini D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5797-5801Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), we did not see an induction of RyR gene expression after treatment with ionomycin (n = 2). Cell viability was unaltered by a 30-min treatment with ionomycin as assessed 18 h after treatment by trypan blue exclusion assay (data not shown). RyR-3 Transcription and Protein Levels Are Increased in TgCRND8 Mice—Because Aβ increased RyR gene expression in primary cortical neurons, we hypothesized that RyR-3 expression is elevated in TgCRND8 mice, a mouse model of Alzheimer disease that produces high levels of Aβ and expresses early cognitive decline (16Chishti M.A. Yang D.S. Janus C. Phinney A.L. Horne P. Pearson J. Strome R. Zuker N. Loukides J. French J. Turner S. Lozza G. Grilli M. Kunicki S. Morissette C. Paquette J. Gervais F. Bergeron C. Fraser P.E. Carlson G.A. George-Hyslop P.S. Westaway D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21562-21570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Examination of cerebrum (forebrain) from the right hemisphere of 4-4.5-month-old TgCRND8 animals showed that RyR-3 mRNA levels were ∼2.6 ± 0.43-fold S.E. higher (n = 16, p < 0.01, two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post-test) compared with their non-Tg littermates (Fig. 1B). There was no change in RyR-1 and RyR-2 (Fig. 1B)orinIP3R-1 and SERCA-2b mRNA levels (not shown). To determine where in TgCRND8 brain the increases in RyR were located, lysates of different brain regions dissected from 4- to 4.5-month-old CRND8 mice were analyzed for RyR protein by Western blot analysis using isoform-specific antibodies (17Rossi D. Simeoni I. Micheli M. Bootman M. Lipp P. Allen P.D. Sorrentino V. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2497-2504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to mRNA levels, RyR-3 levels were increased ∼2.7 ± 0.42-fold S.E. (n = 14, p < 0.001, two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post-test) in the cortex of Tg mice as compared with non-Tg, whereas RyR-1 and RyR-2 levels were unchanged (Fig. 1C). RyR-3 levels were increased 1.9 ± 0.26-fold S.E. in the hippocampus as well (n = 14, p < 0.01, two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post-test) but were unchanged in the basal and cerebellar regions (Fig. 1D). Our statistical tests reveal that these differences in RyR-3 expression are attributed to the genotype (p < 0.0001) and specific to the brain region (p = 0.0011). Aβ Increased RyR-3 mRNA and Protein Levels in CRND8 Cortical Neurons—Based on our observations that Aβ increased RyR gene transcription in naive cortical neurons (Fig. 1A) and that RyR levels are increased in TgCRND8 brain samples (Fig. 1, B-D), we hypothesized that the cortical neurons of TgCRND8 mice had increased RyR gene expression. Primary neuronal cultures from TgCRND8 animals had an increase of ∼3.6 ± 0.71-fold S.E. (n = 3, p < 0.001, two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post-test) in RyR-3 mRNA levels as determined by RT-PCR compared with non-Tg littermate controls on in vitro day 5 (Fig. 2A). Aβ-(1-42) treatment of non-TgCRND8 neurons increased gene expression of RyR-3 3.1 ± 0.17-fold S.E. compared with untreated (n = 3, p < 0.001, two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post-test) to levels comparable with those expressed in TgCRND8 neurons (Fig. 2A). Other treatments, including Aβ-(1-40) and Aβ-(42-1), did not influence RyR-3 gene expression, nor did IP3R-1 and SERCA-2b mRNA levels differ between non-Tg and TgCRND8 neurons (not shown). As an alternative approach to determine whether extracellular Aβ was directly involved in elevating RyR gene expression, we treated TgCRND8 neurons with Aβ-(1-42) antibody (1.3 μg/ml) for 18 h. Quenching of extracellular Aβ-(1- 42) decreased neuronal RyR-3 mRNA levels in Tg neurons by 2.2 ± 0.30-fold S.E. compared with untreated (n = 3, p < 0.001, two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post-test) to levels similar to non-TgCRND8 littermates (Fig. 2B). Our statistical tests reveal that these differences in RyR-3 expression are attributed to the genotype (p < 0.0001) and specific to the type of treatment (p = 0.0056). To determine relative RyR protein levels in CRND8 neurons, an immunofluorescence assay was performed with using isoform-specific RyR antibodies. RyR-3 levels were markedly increased in TgCRND8 primary cortical neurons compared with their non-Tg littermate control cultures (Fig. 2C), whereas RyR-1 and RyR-2 levels did not change. Similarly, non-Tg neurons treated with Aβ-(1-42) (1000 nm) for 18 h had increased RyR-3, but not RyR-1 or RyR-2, levels comparable with Tg neurons (Fig. 2C). Targeting RyR-3 by Gene Silencing Techniques—It was reported recently that RyR levels are increased in other models of AD, and as a result neurons from transgenic mice have elevated responses to 20-25 mm caffeine (12Stutzmann G.E. Smith I. Caccamo A. Oddo S. Laferla F.M. Parker I. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 5180-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 13Smith I.F. Hitt B. Green K.N. Oddo S. LaFerla F.M. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 1711-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Given our observations showing increased RyR-3 levels in TgCRND8 neurons, we wanted to determine whether RyR-3 was involved in the elevated response. Because of a lack of pharmacological tools to selectively block RyR-3, we opted for a molecular approach to target RyR-3 and depress its expression in Tg neurons prior to Ca2+ imaging studies. Diced siRNAs selective for RyR-3 were generated to span a 613-bp section of the mRNA and knock down RyR-3 levels. 200 ng of siRyR-3 was transfected into Tg neurons with GeneSilencer reagent (GSR) for 24 h. At 72 h post-transfection, RyR-3 levels were significantly decreased by 2.9 ± 0.47-fold S.E. compared with untreated (n = 4, p < 0.001, two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post-test) and were comparable with non-Tg neurons (Fig. 3A), whereas RyR-1 and RyR-2 levels did not change (fold changes not shown). Tg neurons treated with GSR, siRyR-3 alone, nonspecific siRNA alone (200 ng), and siRNA with GSR did not show significant changes in RyR-1, -2 (not shown), or -3 (Fig. 3A) mRNA levels. To determine the transfection efficiency of our experiments, we transfected Tg neurons with AlexaFluor 546®-labeled nonspecific siRNA (1 μg) under the same conditions as the siRyR-3 experiments. A transfection efficiency of 74.2 ± 8.3 S.E. % (n = 4 (12 separate fields total), p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA, Student-Newman-Keuls post-test) was obtained at 72 h post-transfection. Knockdown of RyR-3 protein levels in Tg neurons was confirmed by Western blot using isoform-specific antibodies (n = 3, Fig. 3C). At 72 h post-transfection, RyR-3 levels were reduced to 1.79-fold ± S.E. (p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Student-Newman-Keuls post-test) that of untreated Tg neurons. This is a reduction of 44.4 ± 4.5 S.E. %. RyR-1 and RyR-2 levels were unchanged after any treatment (fold changes not shown). Calcium Released from ER Stores Is Increased in TgCRND8 Neurons Expressing Elevated Levels of RyR-3—To determine some of the functional consequences of increased levels of RyR-3 in TgCRND8 mice, we measured Ca2+i levels of neurons after treatments of glutamate and ryanodine. Because of our interest in the contribution of ER Ca2+ stores to the overall Ca2+i response, experiments were conducted in the presence of nominal extracellular Ca2+ to minimize the contribution of Ca2+ influx. Increased Ca2+i because of glutamate is closely associated with neurotoxicity (19Jarvis C.R. Lilge L. Vipond G.J. Andrew R.D. Neuroimage. 1999; 10: 357-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 23Guo Q. Fu W. Sopher B.L. Miller M.W. Ware C.B. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. Nat.

Lett. 2004; 366: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); therefore, we sought to determine whether Tg neurons had altered Ca2+i responses because of increased RyR-3. TgCRND8 neurons at in vitro day 5 demonstrated an elevated Ca2+i response to 250 μm glutamate treatment as compared with non-Tg littermate controls (Fig. 4A), with a peak response of 0.67 ± 0.01 S.E. Fura-2 fluorescence ratio 340/380 nm (n = 15, p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA, Student-Newman-Keuls post-test) for Tg neurons was in contrast to 0.55 ± 0.03 S.E. 340/380 nm for non-Tg (n = 18) (Fig. 4B). To determine the contribution of RyR-3 to the observed increases in Ca2+i levels, Tg neurons were treated with siRyR-3 for 72 h prior to Ca2+ imaging experiments. Knockdown of RyR-3 levels resulted in a decreased Ca2+ response of Tg neurons to glutamate (Fig. 4A), with a peak response of 0.52 ± 0.02 S.E. ratio 340/380 nm (Fig. 4B) that was significantly lower than non-Tg (0.55 ± 0.06 S.E., n = 15, p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, Student-Newman-Keuls post-test). To determine the direct contribution of RyR-gated Ca2+ stores to Ca2+i levels, we performed experiments using an"

As one member of the human NDRG gene family, NDRG2 encodes a protein highly homologous to Ndrg1. However, it is uncertain whether the expression of human NDRG2 is regulated by Myc because mouse ndrg2 and -3 are not affected by Myc. In this study, we provide the novel evidence that the expression of human NDRG2 is down-regulated by Myc via transcriptional repression. A high level of NDRG2 was observed as Myc expression was reduced in differentiated cells, whereas a low level of NDRG2 was shown following increased Myc expression upon serum stimulation. The ectopic expression of c-Myc dramatically reduces the cellular Ndrg2 protein and mRNA level. We further identified the core promoter region of NDRG2 that is required for Myc repression on NDRG2 transcription, and we verified the interaction of Myc with the core promoter region both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the c-Myc-mediated repression of NDRG2 requires association with Miz-1, and possibly the recruitment of other epigenetic factors, such as histone deacetylases, to the promoter.

The myelocytomatosis viral oncogene (myc) was first identified as a cellular homolog of the viral oncogene myc (v-myc) from the retrovirus MC29 in 1978 by Bishop (1Bishop J.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1982; 37: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Several research groups subsequently determined that the cellular myc (c-myc) proto-oncogene was activated in various animal and human tumors (2Cole M.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 361-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 3Dang C.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 103-113PubMed Google Scholar, 4DePinho R.A. Schreiber-Agus N. Alt F.W. Adv. Cancer Res. 1991; 57: 1-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MYC gene family includes c-MYC (cellular MYC), B-MYC (brain-expressed), L-MYC (lung carcinoma-derived), N-MYC (neuroblastoma-derived), and s-MYC. However, only c-MYC, L-MYC, and N-MYC have neoplastic potential (5Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). MYC is undetectable in most normal tissues, but it is highly expressed in tumors. Uncontrolled expression of MYC causes abnormal proliferation that deregulates the cell cycle (6Evan G. Vousden K.H.

Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2235-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). MYC is considered to be a strategic controller of the cell cycle and proliferation (9Wu S. Cetinkaya C.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3703-3712Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). As a transcription factor, Myc belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper region protein family, which includes two N-terminal conserved transactivation domain Myc Boxes, I (MbI) and II (MbII), as well as the C-terminal basic helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper regions. The N-Myc and L-Myc proteins share several regions of at least 80% amino acids sequence homology to c-Myc. Myc functions as transcriptional activator by heterodimerizing with Max, another basic helix-loop-helix protein (12Alex R. Sozeri O. Meyer S. Dildrop R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2257-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Blackwood E.M. Kretzner L. Eisenman R.N. Curr. Opin. Genet.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 15Benvenisty N. Leder A. Kuo A. Leder P. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2513-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Binding of the heterodimers to these enhancer sites regulates the transcription of the target genes. A growing number of cellular genes related to biosynthesis, metabolism, RNA structure determination, and cell cycle control are direct targets of Myc-Max transactivation (16Facchini L.M. Penn L.Z. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 633-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). However, these genes may account for only a portion of the biological activation sites controlled by Myc. Indeed, Myc acts as a transcriptional repressor for a number of genes, including p15ink4b, p21Cip1, and p27Kip1. The mechanism for Myc repression has not been determined. Some genes are found repressed on the transcriptional level, and the response element is located at the transcriptional initiation region (17Li L.H. Nerlov C. Prendergast G. MacGregor D. Ziff E.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4070-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Recently, a Myc-interacting protein, Myc-interacting zinc finger protein 1 (Miz-1), was demonstrated to participate in Myc-mediated repression on p15ink4b and p21Cip1 (9Wu S. Cetinkaya C.

Although NDRG members do not possess a clear functional peptide motif, they do share many well conserved residues among all members. The percentage of shared residue identities among members is roughly 60%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that NDRG1 and -3 belong to one subfamily, whereas NDRG2 and -4 belong to another (24Zhou R.H. Kokame K. Tsukamoto Y. Yutani C. Kato H. Miyata T. Genomics. 2001; 73: 7386-7397Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The various NDRG family members are reportedly intimately involved in cellular differentiation and development. NDRG1, also known as DRG1, CAP43, RTP/rit42, and PROXY-1 (27Kurdistani S.K. Arizti P.

NDRG1 expression is up-regulated in various components of the nervous system, including injured sciatic nerves (34Masuda K. Morikawa W. He J.-W. Kuraoka A. Kuwano M. Kawabuchi M. Glia. 2004; 47: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and may play a key role in hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, Lom. The ndrg1-deficient mice exhibit a progressive demyelinating disorder in the peripheral nervous system (35Okuda T. Higashi Y. Kokame K. Tanaka C. Kondoh H. Miyata T. Mol. Cell.

Neurosci. Lett. 2005; 388: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Taken together, NDRG1 is induced under a number of stress and pathological conditions.We initially identified the human NDRG2 (GenBank™ accession number AF159092) as a candidate for tumor suppressor gene. The expression of NDRG2 in human glioblastoma tissues is significantly lower than that in the normal brain. Transfection of human glioblastoma U373 cells with NDRG2 markedly reduced proliferation of the glioblastoma cells (26Deng Y. Yao L. Chau L. Ng S.S. Peng Y. Liu X. Au W.S. Wang J. Li F. Ji S. Han H.

Recently, NDRG2 was shown to be up-regulated in Alzheimer disease brains (38Mitchelmore C. Buchmann-Moller S. Rask L. West M.J. Troncoso J.C. Jensen N.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2004; 16: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and could induce the differentiation of dendritic cells (40Choi S.C. Kim K.D. Kim J.T.

Brain Res. 2002; 135: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) reported that NDRG2 may facilitate neurite outgrowth of nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells, suggesting the involvement of Ndrg2 in differentiation. These findings implicate Ndrg2 as being associated with cell growth and differentiation.Mouse ndrg1 expression is repressed by N-Myc and c-Myc (25Kokame K. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29659-29665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) via an unknown mechanism. So far, it is uncertain whether human NDRG2 is really regulated by Myc because mouse ndrg2 or -3 is not affected. Defining the functional interaction between Myc and NDRG2 will facilitate the functional understanding of both molecules in cell differentiation and proliferation.In this study, we first displayed an inverse regulatory relationship between human NDRG2 and MYC gene expression events in induced cell differentiation and proliferation. It was confirmed that the ectopic expression of MYC could down-regulate expression of NDRG2. Finally, through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments, we demonstrate that Myc represses NDRG2 gene expression via Miz-1-dependent interaction with NDRG2 core promoter region.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid Constructs—The human NDRG2 promoter was amplified from BAC clone R-998D10 (The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia; GenBank™ accession number AL161668.6) with the Advantage-GC Genomic polymerase (Clontech). The resulting amplicon was cloned into the pGL3-basic vector (Promega, WI) to generate the NDRG2/luciferase reporter plasmid. Various mutants of the human NDRG2 promoter were generated with PCR by using the cloned promoter as template. All of the newly constructed plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. The pcDNA3.1-c-MYC was generously provided by Dr. Michael Cole (Lewis Thomas Laboratory, Princeton University Princeton, NJ). The pBabepuro Myc-ER™ and pBabepuro ΔMyc106–143-ER™ were the gifts from Dr. Gerard Evan (Cancer Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco).

HT-29 cell differentiation was induced with DMEM (without glucose) supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS and 2.5 mm inosine for four passages and then cultured for 10 days (44Wice B.M. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21907-21918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Differentiation of Caco-2 cells to enterocyte-like cells was induced with high glucose DMEM with 10% FBS. Cells at 70–80% confluency were trypsinized and placed onto 12 Transwell plates (24 mm diameter, 3.0-μm pore size; Costar, Cambridge, MA), at density of 105 cells/well, and cultured for 21 days (45Malagolini N. Dall'Olio F. Turrini I. Cessi C. Serafini-Cessi F. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1994; 18: 1386-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing HL60 and U937 cells were treated with 1 μm all-trans-retinoic acid (Promega) (44Wice B.M. Gordon J.I. J. Biol.

In serum stimulation, the full culture medium was replaced with DMEM with 0.1% FBS for 48 h. Then the media were changed with DMEM containing 10% FBS, and the cells were collected at the indicated time points.RT-PCR—The cells were collected at the indicated time points, and the total RNA was isolated from each sample by using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and then quantified. Two μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with reverse transcriptase (Promega, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All PCR experiments were performed with Taq polymerase (Promega, WI) and the primers 5′-gcccagcgatccttacctacc-3′ and 5′-ggctgcccaatccatccaacc-3′ for NDRG2, 5′-gatgacatggtcacgctggctacc-3′ and 5′-tgggctgtgtggattcgcacatgc-3′ for MIZ-1,5′-gatgctctatcttgctctgtaatc-3′ and 5′-tttgaagtatgcatgtaactgccc-3′ for YY-1, and 5′-gcctcaagatcatcagcaat-3′ and 5′-aggtccaccactgacacgtt-3′ for GAPDH control.Cell Lysis and Western Blot—The cells were collected and lysed in 100 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Fifty μg of cell lysate (quantificationally measured by BCA protein assay; Pierce) was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were probed with various antibodies, such as anti-c-Myc rabbit polyclonal (sc-764; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Ndrg2 goat polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-CD18 mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Miz-1 rabbit polyclonal (sc-22837; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-β-actin rabbit polyclonal (Boster, Wu Han, China). To visualize primary antibody-bound protein, the secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:4000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and ECL detection solutions (Pierce) were applied. The scanned images were quantified using Kodak Digital Science one-dimensional software (Eastman Kodak Co., New Haven, CT).Transfection and Reporter Gene Assay—The cells used for transfection (HEK293 and HeLa) were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well and transfected the next day using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at a confluency of about 80%. Briefly, 0.1 μg of reporter DNA was co-transfected with 50 ng of pcDNA3.1-c-MYC (designated as Myc) or its mutant counterparts (the total amount was normalized with empty vector). Five ng fo pRL-CMV and 0.1 μg of green fluorescent protein were co-transfected to monitor the transfection efficiency. Forty eight hours after transfection, the luciferase activity was measured by using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega).Inducible Activation of Myc—HeLa cells were transfected with MycER or ΔMycER expression plasmid, the latter deleted the N-terminal 106–143 residues of Myc. After 24 h, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) (Sigma) was added into cells to a final concentration of 300 nm. The activation (nuclear translocation) of Myc was confirmed by immunofluorescence assay with anti-Myc rabbit polyclonal (sc-764, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. Cells were harvested at indicated time points and applied to Western blotting with antibody against Ndrg2.DNA Pulldown Assay—DNA pulldown assay was performed as described (49Chen L. Peng Z. Bateman E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). DNA covering the core promoter region of NDRG2(–79 to +57 bp) was amplified by PCR with primers, one of which was labeled with biotin. Two μg of purified PCR product was attached to streptavidin-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Pierce). The beads were washed twice with buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol (v/v)) and blocked in the same buffer supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 30 min. Before use, the beads were washed three times with buffer A and then incubated with 50 μg of nuclear extract protein in 350 μl of buffer A containing 5 μg of poly(dI·dC) at room temperature for 30 min. Sepharose beads with adsorbed proteins were pelleted and washed, and then the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis as described, using antibodies against c-Myc, Miz-1 as indicated. The double strand DNA covering putative NF-κB recognizing sequence (–1455/–1160) upstream of the NDRG2 promoter and T7 primer sequence were used as control.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—The cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde and lysed as described (49Chen L. Peng Z. Bateman E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The chromatin DNA was sonicated to an average size of 300–500 bp. The immunoprecipitations were carried out in a ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 167 mm NaCl, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) with the following antibodies: anti-Myc rabbit polyclonal (sc-764; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG mouse M2 monoclonal (F3165; Sigma), anti-acetylhistone H3 rabbit polyclonal antibody (06-599; Upstate), antiacetylhistone H4 rabbit polyclonal antibody (06-866; Upstate), and normal rabbit serum as control. The precipitated DNA was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-ggcattgaccccagagtccctg-3′ (–75/–54) and 5′-gaagttggacaacaaggcgggg-3′ (+29/+50) for NDRG2 core promoter region.Statistics Analysis—We performed t tests and analysis of variance on independent samples using the statistical software SPSS (version 10.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL) to evaluate the differences. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.01 and p < 0.05.RESULTSNDRG2 Expression Was Enhanced in Differentiated Cells Along with the Reduced Myc Content—Reportedly, the differentiation programs of intestinal cells and leukemia cells can induce the down-regulation of Myc (16Facchini L.M. Penn L.Z. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 633-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). To explore the possible relationship between Myc and NDRG2 expression regulation, we induced the differentiation of the intestinal cell lines Caco-2 and HT-29 and the leukemia cell lines U937 and HL60, respectively, and we analyzed the resulting changes of gene and protein expression levels. The differentiation status of Caco-2 and HT-29 cells was confirmed by examining the presence of regular brush borders and tight junctions, which are structural markers of differentiation (supplemental Fig. S1), using transmission electron microscopy. The Myc protein level significantly declined after the Caco-2 and HT-29 cells differentiated, meanwhile the protein level of Ndrg2 increased markedly (Fig. 1A). A similar phenomenon also occurred in the differentiated leukemia cells U937 and HL60. The expression of CD18 was used as the marker of differentiation here (48Buzek J. Latonen L. Kurki S. Peltonen K. Laiho M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2340-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). During the retinoic acid-induced differentiation, the c-Myc protein concentration declined distinctly over time in the U937 and HL60 cells and was almost undetectable at day 9 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the Ndrg2 protein amount showed simultaneous augmentation.NDRG2 Was Down-regulated following the Induction of c-Myc in Growth-stimulated HeLa Cells—To further confirm the functional interactions between NDRG2 and c-MYC, we examined their gene expression behaviors in serum-stimulated HeLa cells. Serum deprivation followed by serum stimulation results in a transient induction of c-Myc (45Malagolini N. Dall'Olio F. Turrini I. Cessi C. Serafini-Cessi F. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1994; 18: 1386-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this experiment, c-Myc expression was induced rapidly 2 h after serum stimulation and reached the highest level after 4 h. Following 10 h of stimulation, the c-Myc level declined gradually, until it reached basal level after 24 h (Fig. 1C). In contrast, Ndrg2 displayed the opposite kinetics. As shown in Fig. 1C, the amount of the Ndrg2 started to decline following 4 h of serum stimulation, an event that lagged ∼2 h behind the decline of c-Myc expression. Ndrg2 maintained its lowest level from 6 to 12 h post-stimulation. After 24 h of stimulation, the Ndrg2 level recovered partially. This staggered induction time line between c-Myc and Ndrg2 suggests a regulatory role for c-Myc on the NDRG2 gene.Ectopic Expression of c-Myc Resulted in Down-regulation of Ndrg2—To assess directly whether c-Myc can down-regulate the NDRG2 expression, we transfected a construct harboring a c-Myc fused with the ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ER) into HeLa cells. This system permits an inducible nuclear translocation of MycER by 4-OHT, which was confirmed here by immunofluorescence analysis (supplemental Fig. S2). The expression of MycER and ΔMycER relative to the endogenous Myc protein is shown in Fig. 2A. The Ndrg2 level declined following the MycER activation and reached the lowest level at 24 h post-activation in HeLa cells (Fig. 2B). However, the Ndrg2 level was not changed in the cells transfected with the mutant ΔMycER, in which the sequences responsible for transcriptional repression (9Wu S. Cetinkaya C. Munoz-Alonso M.J. von der Lehr N. Beuger V. Eilers M. Leon J. Larsson L.G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 17Li L.H. Nerlov C. Prendergast G. MacGregor D. Ziff E.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4070-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) were deleted (Fig. 2B). The data from the semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay were consistent with those of the Western blotting analysis (Fig. 2, C and D), suggesting the repression of Myc on NDRG2 occurred at the transcriptional level.FIGURE 2Ectopic expression of Myc represses Ndrg2 expression.

The figure shows the tendency of each group as indicated. All the assays were duplicated for at least three independent experiments. The results are shown as the mean ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Myc Represses the Promoter Activity of NDRG2—To address the mechanism of Myc-induced transcriptional repression, we amplified the putative promoter region flanking 5′ of the first exon of the NDRG2 gene (–1455/+274) (supplemental Fig. S3). Reporter gene assay confirmed the promoter activity, which is partly consistent with the prediction based with an on-line promoter scan service. The core promoter region was mapped within –79/+57 with series deletion assay (see Fig. 3A). Co-transfection of c-MYC or N-MYC with the NDRG2/luciferase reporter gene in HEK293 cells, respectively, resulted in repression of the NDRG2 promoter (Fig. 3B). To map the domains of Myc required for repression, we deleted the N-terminal Myc box II (MbII) and the C-terminal helix-loop-helix domain of c-Myc and N-Myc, and we designated them as ΔN and ΔC, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3B, the N-terminal deletion reduced the Myc-induced repression of NDRG2 partially, whereas the C-terminal deletion abolished Myc-induced repression completely. Similar results were obtained in HeLa cells (data not shown). The relative equivalent expression of wild type and mutant c-Myc and N-Myc proteins was confirme"

(EC 1.3.3.4), the penultimate enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway, is the last common enzyme in heme and chlorophyll biosynthesis. It catalyzes the six-electron oxidation of protoporphyrinogen IX to protoporphyrin IX (1Poulson R. Polglase W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1209-1274Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 2Dailey H.A. Dailey H.A. Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1990: 123-161Google Scholar). In humans, defects in the PPOX gene result in the dominantly inherited disorder variegate porphyria (VP) (3Brenner D. Bloomer J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1980; 302: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 4Deybach J.C. de Verneuil H. Nordmann Y. Hum. Genet. 1981; 58: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), characterized by cutaneous photosensitivity and the propensity to develop acute neurovisceral crisis (5Meissner P.N. Day R.S. Moore M.R. Disler P.B. Harley E. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 1986; 16: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This disease is particularly prevalent in South Africa because of a founder gene effect (an R59W mutation) (6Meissner P.N. Dailey T.A. Hift R.J. Ziman M. Corrigall A.V. Roberts A.G. Meissner D.M. Kirsch R.E. Dailey H.A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 7Warnich L. Kotze M.J. Groenewald I.M. Groenewald J.Z. van Brakel M.G. van Heerden C.J. de Villiers J.N. van de Ven W.J. Schoenmakers E.F. Taketani S. Retief A.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 981-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In plants, PPOX is a target of light-dependent peroxidizing herbicides, which act as competitive inhibitors (8Matringe M. Camadro J. Labbe P. Scalla R. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) resulting in desiccation and photobleaching of green plant tissue. Of the herbicides known to inhibit PPOX, the diphenylethers, of which acifluorfen (AF) is the most well studied, are of great interest. Such inhibition has also been documented in mammals and bacteria (9Camadro J.M. Matringe M. Scalla R. Labbe P. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Corrigall A.V. Hift R.J. Adams P.D. Kirsch R.E. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1994; 34: 1283-1289PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of the enzyme leads to the accumulation and export of protoporphyrinogen to the cytoplasm, where it undergoes non-enzymatic oxidation to porphyrin. In the presence of light, accumulation of protoporphyrin can lead to reactive oxygen species that may induce cellular damage, primarily via peroxidation of membrane lipids, and ultimately cell death. A similar photodestructive mechanism, because of accumulating porphyrin intermediates in the skin of patients with VP, is probably responsible for the photocutaneous manifestations in this condition (11Kirsch R.E. Meissner P.N. Hift R.J. Semin. Liv. Dis. 1998; 18: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, PPOX is functionally conserved despite a low sequence identity. It is an intrinsic protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane and requires molecular oxygen and a flavin cofactor (in most cases, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)) for this conversion. However, it is possible that diverse catalytic mechanisms may exist, especially in prokaryotes that can survive under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions (12Camadro J.M. Thome F. Brouillet N. Labbe P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32085-32091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Klemm D.J. Barton L.L. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5209-5215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three molecules of oxygen, the ultimate fate of which is hydrogen peroxide rather than water, serve as the final electron acceptors in the aerobic reaction in both eukaryotic and most prokaryotic PPOXs (14Ferreira G.C. Andrew T.L. Karr S.W. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3835-3839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Dailey H.A. Dailey T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8714-8718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, in the case of Escherichia coli the respiratory chain of the cell serves as the electron acceptor, and in the anaerobe Desulfovibrio gigas the electron acceptor is unclear (13Klemm D.J. Barton L.L. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5209-5215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction proceeds via three two-electron oxidations rather than a single six-electron oxidation. A mechanism for the removal of four hydrogens in the meso positions of the porphyrin ring has been suggested in which three desaturation steps occur with the involvement of one particular face of the porphyrin ring and one prototropic rearrangement step using the other face of the ring (16Akhtar M. Jordan P.M. Biosynthesis of Tetrapyrroles. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1991: 67-99Google Scholar). In bacteria, PPOX enzymes are less well characterized and exhibit relatively diverse behavior (17Corrigall A.V. Siziba K.B. Maneli M.H. Shephard E.G. Ziman M. Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. Meissner P.N. R.E. K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 358: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Of the bacterial enzymes studied, PPOX from Myxococcus xanthus (mxPPOX) is most similar to the eukaryotic enzymes, being dimeric, membrane-bound, and inhibited by AF (15Dailey H.A. Dailey T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8714-8718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the PPOX from Bacillus subtilis, which is monomeric, cytoplasmic, has broader substrate specificity, and is not inhibited by AF (18Dailey T.A. Meissner P. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 813-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An interesting feature of PPOX from M. xanthus is its ability to convey herbicidal resistance to oxyfluorfen-treated transgenic rice plants by overexpression of the engineered PPOX gene to counteract the photodynamic stress in these plants (19Jung S. Back K. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2005; 43: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Prokaryotic diversity with respect to the electron acceptor/donor used also appears to exist (see above). PPOX from the thermophile Aquifex aeolicus is most similar to M. xanthus differing only in its monomeric state (20Wang K.F. Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 202: 115-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of mitochondrial tobacco PPOX (mtPPOX) with a phenylpyrazol inhibitor has been solved to a 2.9-Å resolution (21Koch M. Breithaupt C. Kiefersauer R. Freigang J. Huber R. Messerschmidt A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1720-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The structure revealed it to be a loosely associated dimer of a tri-lobed protein. The three lobes were designated: a FAD-binding domain of the p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase type fold; a substrate-binding domain that enclosed a narrow active site cavity beneath the FAD; and an α-helical membrane-binding domain (21Koch M. Breithaupt C. Kiefersauer R. Freigang J. Huber R. Messerschmidt A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1720-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Here, we present the first prokaryotic PPOX structure from M. xanthus. Despite a low sequence identity with mtPPOX, the fold for both proteins is largely conserved. However, the different charge distribution of mxPPOX suggests an alternative membrane binding orientation, and this, combined with the crystal packing, suggests other differences in its dimerization interface. We also present the crystal structure of mxPPOX bound to AF, allowing visualization of this important complex for the first time. Furthermore, to elucidate the determinants of the active site important for AF binding, we have compared our structure with a model of the AF-resistant PPOX from B. subtilis. Expression and Purification of M. xanthus PPOX—The expression vector (pMx-PPO) containing M. xanthus cDNA (22Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was kindly donated by Prof. H. Dailey, University of Georgia, Athens, GA. The vector was transfected into and maintained in E. coli JM109 cells. For expression of recombinant mxPPOX, 3 × 1 ml of PPOX JM109 cell glycerol stocks were inoculated into 3 × 1 liter of LB medium and grown at 37 °C for 22 h with shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in 90 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Tween 20, pH 8.0 (buffer A) prior to sonication (four times for 30 s). The lysate was centrifuged (105000 × g) for 40 min and the supernatant loaded onto a Talon resin (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) column pre-equilibrated with buffer A. After loading, the column was washed with buffer A; buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, pH 6.3); buffer C, (50 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, pH 6.3), and buffer C at pH 7.0 containing 25 mm imidazole. Elution was in buffer C (pH 7.0) containing 100 mm imidazole. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 μg/ml) was added throughout the purification procedure, which was performed at room temperature. After purification, 1.5 eq of FAD was added to the eluate. Purity of the eluted PPOX was assessed by SDS-PAGE (7.5-17.5%) and protein concentrations determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay in an aliquot excluding FAD. The protein was concentrated in a 30-kDa cut off Amicon concentrator, in a series of brief spins at 5000 × g, until an estimated concentration of 12 mg/ml was achieved and stored at 4 °C in the dark. Crystallization, X-ray Data Collection, and Structure Solution—For native mxPPOX, initial crystals in tetragonal form were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 16 °C in the dark. 2 μl of PPOX (3.7 mg/ml in 50 mm Na2HPO4, 0.1 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Tween 20, pH 7, 0.15 mm FAD) was mixed with 2 μl of well solution (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1.5 m (NH4)2SO4, 12% glycerol). A data set to 2.9 Å was collected at 100 K on station PX 9.6 of the Synchrotron Radiation Source, Daresbury, UK, using the well solution plus 25% glycerol as a cryoprotectant. The data were processed and scaled to 2.9 Å using the HKL2000 software package (HKL Research, Charlottesville, VA) (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Later, crystals were grown with increased glycerol and the addition of PEG 4000 to the well solution (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 m (NH4)2SO4, 20% glycerol, 1% PEG 4000) to decrease their solvent content. Additionally, 1% PEG 4000 was added to the well solution on 3 days prior to data collection. The crystal diffracted to 2.7 Å at 100 K on station PX 14.2 of the Synchrotron Radiation Source, Daresbury, UK. No additional cryoprotectant was used, but the cold stream was blocked for 5 s to anneal the crystal and remove the ice rings. The data were processed with MOSFLM (24Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACMB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 26Google Scholar) and scaled with SCALA in CCP4 (25No. 4 Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The final model contained 2 FAD molecules, 6 glycerol molecules, three Tween 20 molecules, and 146 water molecules. The quality of the structure was validated with the program WHAT IF (32Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref Scopus (3377) Google Scholar), and the ϕ-Ψ conformational angle values were within the normal range. Acifluorfen·mxPPOX Complex—AF was from Chem Services (West Chester, PA). mxPPOX at ∼7 mg/ml was incubated with 100 μm AF (in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m imidazole, pH 7, 2.5% Me2SO) on ice in the dark for 5 h. One μl of complex was mixed with 1 μl of well solution (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 m (NH4)2SO4, 20% glycerol, 1% PEG 4000) and suspended above the well as a hanging drop. Additionally, 1% PEG 4000 was added to the well solution 3 days prior to data collection. Data were collected at 100 K on station PX 14.1 of the Synchrotron Radiation Source, Daresbury, UK. No additional cryoprotectant was used, but the cold-stream was blocked for 5 s to anneal the crystal, although a small ice ring was still present and reduced the completeness of the data around ∼3.5-Å resolution. The data were processed and scaled in P4212 with HKL2000 to 2.3 Å (Table 1) (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The native mxPPOX was refined with the new data with REFMAC (30Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) through CCP4i and the AF built into incomplete but clear difference density with the aid of COOT graphics program (31Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). The final model contained 2 FAD, 5 glycerol, 2 AF, 1 Tween 20, and 288 water molecules. The final structure had R-cryst of 23% and R-free (2% of the reflections) of 28% (see Table 1). The stereochemistry of the structure was checked with WHAT IF (32Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref Scopus (3377) Google Scholar), and the ϕ-Ψ conformational angle values were within the normal range. All figures were produced in Pymol (33DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar) except Fig. 1, A-D, which were prepared using Molscript (34Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and rendered in Povray, and Fig. 1E, which was prepared with MDL® ISIS/Draw 2.5. Overall Structures—mxPPOX was crystallized in the space group P4212 with two monomers (A and B) in the asymmetric unit. Most of the model is well ordered for both the native structure and the AF complex, with the exception of few residues at each termini, the loop from residues 208 to 214, which are not visible in the map and a disordered region between residues 88 and 93. Also, a few side chains in both structures (mostly located on the surface of the molecules) are truncated because of insufficient density. No ligand-dependent conformational change in the mxPPOX·AF structure was observed (r.m.s.d. of 0.3 Å for 449 Cα atoms as calculated by the Dali server (36Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar)). Viewed from its flattest surface, mxPPOX branches into three lobes, one mainly helical, one predominantly β-sheet, and one mixed (Fig. 1A). In the case of mtPPOX, Koch et al. (21Koch M. Breithaupt C. Kiefersauer R. Freigang J. Huber R. Messerschmidt A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1720-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) designated these lobes as the membrane-, substrate-, and FAD-binding domains, respectively. However, these are probably referred to as pseudo-domains as they do not fold independently. Active Site Structure and Conservation—The mxPPOX active site is a hydrophobic cavity seated at the interface of the three pseudo-domains. An almost continuous chain of difference density was observed in the active site of the native structure that could not be accounted for by water or glycerol molecules. This density was finally modeled as a Tween 20 molecule, the long hydrophobic chain of which matches the length of the density. Interestingly, the density had similar shape and dimensions to the substrate (Fig. 1E), and the modeled substrate (after energy minimization) matched the position and orientation of the Tween (Fig. 2A). The width of the active site is limited by Arg-95 and Gly-447 and is larger than the tetrapyrrole macrocycle. The modeled macrocycle is sandwiched between the isoalloxazine ring of the FAD, which acts as a ceiling, and the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-167, which protrudes from the floor of the active site (Fig. 2A). Although the sequence identity between PPOX enzymes is very low, there are some well conserved residues in the active site that can be rationalized in terms of the modeled substrate. Arg-95, the equivalent of Arg-98 in the mtPPOX, is well conserved across species and has been proposed to interact ionically with ring C of the substrate (Fig. 1E) (21Koch M. Breithaupt C. Kiefersauer R. Freigang J. Huber R. Messerschmidt A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1720-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The conservation of this bulky residue on one side of the pocket has presumably constrained the size of the residue on the other side as it is always a relatively small uncharged residue in the majority of species (Ala, Gly, Thr, or Ser in all cases). Gly-167 is also conserved, and its carbonyl oxygen, which protrudes from the floor of the cavity to the center of the active site, probably serves to center the tetrapyrrole macrocycle. Phe-329 that is conserved in many species such as tobacco, human, and mouse is optimally placed to limit the height of the ceiling of the cavity on the opposite side of the macrocycle to the FAD. Other residues in the active site are not conserved but show similarity in type or size among many species. For example, Phe-392 in mtPPOX, which stacked with the modeled porphyrin ring A, is not conserved is mxPPOX. It is replaced by an equally bulky residue, Met-365, that is also seen in human and mouse PPOXs. Another non-conserved residue of more interest is Asn-63, positioned on the opposite side of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD to the substrate binding site (Fig. 2C). This residue is equivalent to Arg-59 in human PPOX, and Arg-59-Trp mutation is by far the most prevalent VP mutation identified to date (see “Variegate Porphyria Mutations”). Human PPOX Arg-59 has also been shown to be essential for enzymatic activity and structural stability in vitro (37Maneli M.H. Corrigall A.V. Klump H.H. Davids L.M. Kirsch R.E. Meissner P.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1650: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It has been proposed from the mtPPOX structure that human PPOX Arg-59 forms a salt bridge with an aspartate (Asp-349) opposite, and that this helps maintain the integrity of the active site. Although mxPPOX has different residues at these positions, the resolution of our structures allows us to visualize a hydrogen-bonding network surrounding Asn-63 mediated by several water molecules. Asn-63 forms a hydrogen bond with nearby Arg-354, plus water mediated interactions with nearby Ser-363, Glu-59, and the N-5 and O-4 atoms of the FAD cofactor. This analysis agrees with the hypothesis that this residue may be important for active site integrity and stability, holding together the FAD and the substrate-binding pseudo-domains. It also suggests that this residue may impact on the catalytic activity, as it makes a water-mediated interaction with the active N-5 atom of the FAD. There has been little work in elucidating the precise mechanism of PPOX oxidation. Akhtar (16Akhtar M. Jordan P.M. Biosynthesis of Tetrapyrroles. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1991: 67-99Google Scholar) proposed three desaturation reactions, removing a hydride from one face of the macrocycle followed by a prototopic rearrangement with a proton removed from the other face of the macrocycle. Further to this, Koch et al. (21Koch M. Breithaupt C. Kiefersauer R. Freigang J. Huber R. Messerschmidt A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1720-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) suggested that all the electrons are lost from a single point in the macrocycle, based on the lack of space for the substrate to rotate in the active site and their modeled orientation of the ring in the mtPPOX crystal structure. Although our structure verifies that the substrate is unable to rotate in the active site, we cannot confirm the substrate orientation proposed by Koch et al. (21Koch M. Breithaupt C. Kiefersauer R. Freigang J. Huber R. Messerschmidt A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1720-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Both structures show the porphyrin ring has to lie horizontal to the active site with the propionyl groups pointing toward the cavity, but it is less clear from our structure, which half of the ring should be closer to the FAD. Although, the oxidation of half was preferred by Akhtar (16Akhtar M. Jordan P.M. Biosynthesis of Tetrapyrroles. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1991: 67-99Google Scholar), and this half is modeled closest to the FAD in the model by Koch et al. (21Koch M. Breithaupt C. Kiefersauer R. Freigang J. Huber R. Messerschmidt A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1720-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), our structure does not conclusively confirm these results. Acifluorfen Binding—AF is a bicyclic non-planar molecule proposed to mimic half of the protoporphyrinogen tetrapyrrole macrocycle. Previous detailed structural comparison of AF and protoporphyrinogen suggested that both the bond and the torsion angles of AF at the ether oxygen match closely with the angles at the methylene bridges between the rings of the protoporphyrinogen macrocycle (38Nandihalli U.B. Duke M.V. Duke S.O. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1992; 43: 193-211Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the mxPPOX·AF complex, AF is observed deep in the substrate binding pocket. It makes no direct hydrogen bonds with the enzyme but is accommodated by the shape of the hydrophobic pocket and makes three key interactions (Fig. 2B). The nitro group is held in the active site by the positively charged Arg-95 (distance 3.4 Å), and the carboxylate group makes water-mediated interaction with the carbonyl oxygen of Val-164; the water occupying the position where the methyl group of methyl-AF might be expected to fit. There is also an aromatic-aromatic interaction (39Burley S.K. Petsko G.A. Science. 1985; 229: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar) between Phe-329 and the 2-nitrobenzoic acid moiety. The non-polar nature of the binding highlights the importance of the shape of the inhibitor to fit this pocket, in what is presumed to be a fairly rigid active site. In the absence of hydrogen bond formation on inhibitor binding, the higher affinity of methyl-AF for many PPOXs (9Camadro J.M. Matringe M. Scalla R. Labbe P. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) may therefore be because of the gain in entropy following the displacement of more water molecules by the larger inhibitor. AF, however, does not perfectly mimic the flat substrate, and comparison of the modeled protoporphyrinogen with AF reveals differences in their modes of binding. Protoporphyrinogen is a tetrapyrrole macrocycle with each of the pyrroles joined by a methylene bridge. By contrast, AF is based on two benzene rings joined by an ether linkage and therefore is both wider than the individual pyrrole rings and longer than the edge of the tetrapyrrole. The 2-nitrobenzoic acid moiety lies flat in the pocket and is held snugly against β17, sandwiched between Arg-95, Leu-332, and Phe-329 (Fig. 2B). The 2-chloro-4-trifluoromethylphenoxy moiety is situated in a much wider pocket between Met-365 and Gly-167 and tilts at an angle of 45° relative to the plane. The extra width of the AF 2-chloro-4-trifluoromethylphenoxy moiety cannot be accommodated in the plane of the tetrapyrrole macrocycle because of the projection of the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-167 from the cavity floor and is therefore channeled between the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-167 and the cavity wall (Ile-311, Ile-412, and Ala-170).

These enzymes catalyze the cleavage the protein components of the extracellular matrix and play a pivotal role in connective tissue remodeling during development, wound healing, and other physiological processes (1Nagase H.

There are a total of 24 MMPs in humans that have broad and overlapping specificities. The collagenases, a subgroup of MMPs that cleave collagens type I, II, and III, include MMP-1 (fibroblast collagenase), MMP-8 (neutrophil collagenase), and MMP-13 (collagenase-3) (2Welgus H.G.

Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar). MMP-1 is considered a prototype for all interstitial collagenases and plays an important role in the turnover of collagen fibrils in the matrix. Much evidence indicates that collagenolysis is an important event in diverse physiologic processes such as development, tissue morphogenesis, and wound repair (5Greene J. Wang M. Liu Y.E. Raymond L.A. Rosen C. Shi Y.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30375-30380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), whereas unregulated collagen breakdown has been implicated in a variety of human diseases including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, pulmonary emphysema, and fibrotic disorders (6Laurent G.J. Tetley T.D. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 1984; 14: 411-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Therefore, knowledge of the structural basis of collagenase action and its regulation is crucial for understanding the molecular basis of these diseases and opening new therapeutic avenues. MMPs are initially synthesized as inactive precursors (pro-MMPs), and the levels of MMP activity in tissues are closely regulated at the levels of gene expression, pro-MMP activation, and inhibition of the active enzymes. The principal endogenous inhibitors of active MMP in tissues are four tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1 to TIMP-4). These two-domain proteins are 40-50% identical in sequence (7Pohar N. Godenschwege T.A. Buchner E. Genomics. 1999; 57: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Their N-terminal domains have about 120 amino acids, whereas the C-domains contain about 65 residues; in mammalian TIMPs each domain is stabilized by three disulfide cross-links (8Murphy G. Houbrechts A. Cockett M.I. Williamson R.A. O'Shea M. Docherty A.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8097-8102Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domains (designated N-TIMPs) can fold independently and carry the full inhibitory activity toward their target MMPs (9Huang W. Meng Q. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22086-22091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 10Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 496-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). TIMPs form tight non-covalent 1:1 inhibitory complexes with MMPs albeit with relatively low selectivity (10Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 496-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). An exception to this is TIMP-1, which is a weak inhibitor of some membrane-type MMPs. Crystal structures have been determined for two inhibitory MMP·TIMP complexes; that is, the catalytic domain of MMP-3 (MMP-3cd) in complex with the full-length TIMP-1 (PDB code 1UEA (11Gomis-Ruth F.X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar)) and the complex of MT1-MMPcd with TIMP-2 (PDB code 1BQQ (12Fernandez-Catalan C. Bode W. Huber R. Turk D. Calvete J.J. Lichte A. Tschesche H. Maskos K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar)). In addition, a structure has been determined for the complex of pro-MMP-2 with the full-length TIMP-2 (PDB code 1GXD (13Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Tryggvason K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7414-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar)), which exemplifies a distinct type of non-inhibitory complex stabilized by interactions between the C-terminal domain of TIMP and the non-catalytic hemopexin domains of pro-MMP. The previously determined structures show that the N-terminal inhibitory domains of TIMPs have the widely distributed oligonucleotide binding fold. In the inhibitory complexes this domain makes most of contacts with the protease. The core of the interaction site is a continuous ridge stabilized by a disulfide bond between Cys-1 and Cys-70, that links the N-terminal four residues (1CTCV4) with residues 66MESVC70. Cys-1 interacts bidentately with the catalytic zinc through the N-terminal α-amino group and carbonyl group, displacing the water molecule that is needed for peptide bond hydrolysis, whereas residue 2 (Thr-2 in TIMP-1) interacts with the so-called S1′ specificity pocket of the MMP, a region that has a dominant role in enzyme specificity. In addition, the structures also show that the loops of the N-terminal domain of TIMP-1 between β-strands A and B and between strands E and F also facilitate interactions of the inhibitor with the protease. Mutational analyses of residues implicated in binding have shown that changes in the interaction site in TIMPs can significantly change its relative affinity for different MMPs, raising the possibility of generating TIMP variants that are selective inhibitors of disease-related MMPs that could open a novel approach to disease treatment (14Meng Q.

The structures of different TIMP·MMP complexes can provide information about differences in interaction interfaces that are crucial for the rational design of selective TIMP variants. For this reason we have conducted an x-ray crystallographic analysis of the complex formed between N-TIMP-1 and the catalytic domain of MMP-1 (MMP-1cd). The crystal structure provides new insights into features that influence the affinity of MMP-1 and, thus, helps provide a crucial platform for further engineering of MMP-selective TIMPs and small molecule inhibitors. Cloning, Protein Expression, and Protein Purification—Human N-TIMP-1 was expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21 DE3) cells, partially purified, and folded as described previously (16Huang W. Nagase H. Arumugam S. Van Doren S. Brew K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), with the exception that the protein was extracted from inclusion bodies and initially purified by gel filtration in 6 m guanidine HCl rather than 8 m urea. After partial purification of the folded protein by cation exchange chromatography with carboxymethylcellulose, further purification was performed by medium pressure cation exchange chromatography using a Bio-Rad Biologic DuoFlow chromatography system to separate active and inactive forms of the protein (17Arumugam S. Gao G. Patton B.L. Semenchenko V. Brew K. Van Doren S.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 719-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). After dialysis against 20 mm Bis-Tris-HCl, pH 5.5, the N-TIMP-1 was applied to a Mono S HR (5/5) column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been previously equilibrated with the same buffer. Elution was performed with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl over 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and the effluent was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. Two similarly sized slightly overlapping peaks were collected manually of which the second contained the MMP-inhibitory activity. The vector for bacterial expression of the catalytic domain of MMP-1 (pET3a, MMP-1cd) was kindly provided by Dr. H. Nagase. Protein expression and isolation of inclusion bodies was carried out as for N-TIMP-1. Recombinant protein was extracted from inclusion bodies with 8 m urea containing 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.5, containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a column (1.5 × 10 cm) of MacroPrep 50Q anion exchange resin that had been equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 8 m urea that was subsequently washed with the same buffer at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in equilibration buffer at the same flow rate and collected in 4.5-ml fractions. Fractions containing MMP-1cd were identified by SDS-PAGE and pooled. For folding, the denatured protein was dialyzed twice (16 h each) against 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, containing 250 mm NaCl, 20 mm CaCl2, and 50 μm ZnCl2 at 4 °C. The solution was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min to remove precipitate, and the supernatant was purified by gel filtration with a column (2.5 × 35 cm) of Superdex-75 that was equilibrated and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl and 20 mm CaCl2 at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Preparation of N-TIMP-1·MMP-1cd Complex—Samples of N-TIMP-1 (3 ml; 330 nmol) and MMP-1cd (25 ml: 230 nmol) in TNC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm CaCl2) were mixed and incubated overnight at room temperature to ensure complex formation. The solution was concentrated to about 12 ml, and the complex was purified by gel filtration with a column of Superdex-75 (3.5 × 40 cm) equilibrated and eluted with TNC buffer at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Fractions of 6 ml were collected, and protein was detected by absorbance at 280 nm. The elution profile (not shown) consisted of a major peak followed by a minor peak; SDS-PAGE of the major peak (complex) gave bands with apparent molecular masses of 14.5 and 19 kDa, corresponding to N-TIMP-1 and MMP-1cd, whereas the minor peak contained only N-TIMP-1. Crystallization, X-ray Diffraction Data Collection, and Processing—Crystals for the N-TIMP-1·MMP-1cd complex were grown at 16 °C by the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique with 10% polyethylene glycol 8000, 8% ethylene glycol, and 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, as the reservoir solution. A full dataset to 2.54 Å resolution was collected on station PX 9.6 of the Synchrotron Radiation Source, Daresbury (UK), at 100 K from a single crystal. Data processing was performed with the HKL package (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The command script for AMoRe was edited to include the NCS translation vector (0.33 0.00 0.00). Once the three MMP-1cd molecules were located and their position in the asymmetric unit defined, the N-TIMP-1 molecules were located one by one. Structures for the three MMP-1cd molecules and the three N-TIMP-1 molecules were built and ensured that there were no symmetry-related clashes using the program COOT (22Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23605) Google Scholar). Structure Refinement—Crystallographic refinement was carried out using the program CNS (23Brunger A.T. Rice L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 243-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) at 2.54 Å resolution against 91.2% of the measured data. A test set of random reflections of 2.7% was excluded from the full data set for cross-validation purposes (24Brunger A.T. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 366-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) by calculating the free R-factor (Rfree) to monitor refinement trend. An initial round of refinement with the three complexes found by AMoRe (20Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) resulted in an Rcryst of 37.6% and an Rfree of 43.0%. Few cycles of refinement (energy minimization, simulated annealing, and individual temperature factor (B-factor) refinement) using NCS restraints in CNS (23Brunger A.T. Rice L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 243-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and model building with reference to 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps using the program COOT (22Emsley P. Cowtan K.

Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13911) Google Scholar) was used to incorporate TLS (26Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar) thermal refinement. Each molecule within the asymmetric unit was defined as a TLS tensor group for the purpose of refinement. Refinement proceeded in 15-30 cycles of TLS refinement with atomic residual isotropic B-factors set at 45 Å2 followed by 15 cycles of individual atomic restrained refinement. Water molecules with peaks greater than 3σ in the Fo - Fc maps and those within hydrogen bonding distances from appropriate atoms were incorporated into the structure. The final refined structure at 2.54 Å resolution had an Rcryst of 24.8% and an Rfree of 27.5% (Table 1).TABLE 1Crystallographic, data processing, and refinement statisticsSpace groupMonoclinic, C2Unit cell dimensions (Å)a = 158.09, b = 67.85, c = 86.24Resolution range (Å)23.0-2.54Total reflections measured191,162Unique reflections measured29,526RsymaRsym = ΣhklΣi|Ii(hkl – 〈I(hkl) 〉 |/ΣhklΣiIi(hkl), where 〈I 〉 is the averaged intensity of the i observations of reflection hkl (%)8.8 (45.1)I/σ (I) (outermost shell)bOutermost shell; the resolution range of the outermost shell is 2.63-2.54 Å8.3 (2.8)Completeness (outermost shell) (%)98.4 (99.4)RcrystcRcryst = Σ||Fo| – |Fc||/Σ|Fo|, where Fo and Fc are observed and calculated structure factors, respectively (%)24.8RfreedRfree is equal to Rcryst for a random subset of reflections (2.2%) not used in refinement (%)27.5Contents of the asymmetric unit Protein atoms6,495 Solvent molecules42 Ions15 (6 zinc ions and 9 calcium ions)r.m.s. deviation Bond lengths (Å)0.006 Bond angles (°)0.9Average B-factor (Å2) MMPsAll atoms (A, B, C)46.2 (A), 45.9 (B), 44.9 (C)Main-chain atoms46.1 (A), 45.8 (B), 44.8 (C)Side-chain atoms46.3 (A), 46.1 (B), 45.0 (C) TIMPsAll atoms (D, E, F)43.6 (D), 43.8 (E), 43.4 (F)Main-chain atoms43.5 (D), 43.7 (E), 43.6 (F)Side-chain atoms43.8 (D), 43.9 (E), 44.0 (F)Ions (6 zinc and 9 calcium)41.7Solvent molecules31.3a Rsym = ΣhklΣi|Ii(hkl – 〈I(hkl) 〉 |/ΣhklΣiIi(hkl), where 〈I 〉 is the averaged intensity of the i observations of reflection hklb Outermost shell; the resolution range of the outermost shell is 2.63-2.54 Åc Rcryst = Σ||Fo| – |Fc||/Σ|Fo|, where Fo and Fc are observed and calculated structure factors, respectivelyd Rfree is equal to Rcryst for a random subset of reflections (2.2%) not used in refinement Open table in a new tab The structure of the N-TIMP-1·MMP-1cd complex (Fig. 1a) was determined at 2.54 Å resolution. Details of the data processing and refinement statistics are given in Table 1. The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains three copies of the complex. All the three complexes in the asymmetric unit are identical in their orientation and are translationally related to each other along the x axis by the vector 0.33, 0, 0. The MMP components of these complexes are designated A, B, and C and the cognate N-TIMP components D, E, and F, respectively. Residues 49-57 in all the three N-TIMP-1 molecules could not be positioned unambiguously because of the lack of electron density and were, therefore, modeled as glycines. The other residues modeled as glycine or alanine includes 41, 78, 91, 114, and 118 of N-TIMP-1. The disordered residues are distant from the binding interface and consequently do not affect our analysis of the interactions between the two components of the complex. The refined model includes 854 protein residues, 42 water molecules, 6 zinc ions, and 9 calcium ions. Analysis with PROCHECK (27Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) indicates that the φ-Ψ conformational angles are within the limits expected for a structure at this resolution with no residues in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot (99.3% residues in the core region). Overall Structure of the Complex—The inhibitory domain of TIMP-1 has a characteristic oligonucleotide binding-fold architecture consisting of a five-stranded β-sheet of Greek key topology and two or three associated α-helices (three in N-TIMP-1). The closed β-barrel is bound by loops connecting strands B-C and strands C-D on each end. The individual N-TIMP-1 structures from the three complexes are closely similar to each other, with r.m.s.d. values of 0.7 Å. Least squares super-positioning of N-TIMP-1 (chain D) with N-TIMP-1 extracted from the published TIMP-1·MMP-3cd complex (PDB code 1UEA (11Gomis-Ruth F.X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar)) and the averaged NMR ensemble for free N-TIMP-1 (PDB code 1D2B (28Wu B. Arumugam S. Gao G. Lee G.I. Semenchenko V. Huang W. Brew K. Van Doren S.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)) yielded r.m.s. deviations of 0.93 and 1.46 Å, respectively. These alignments indicate that N-TIMP-1 in the MMP-1 complex is structurally more similar to the inhibitory domain from the full-length TIMP-1 structure. The catalytic domain of MMP-1 also exhibits the typical extended ellipsoid shape where the active-site cleft anchoring the catalytic zinc bifurcates the upper subdomain from the lower subdomain. Apart from the active-site zinc, the domain also contains a structural zinc ion and three calcium ions that are required for stability and structure. All the analyses reported here have been carried out using complex A and are replicated in the other two complexes of the asymmetric unit unless otherwise stated. The three MMP-1cd structures in the complexes are closely similar with r.m.s.d values of 0.4 Å. Atom-by-atom r.m.s. deviations in these comparisons revealed that most of the differences lie in the loop connecting strands sA and sB (AB loop) and in the loop containing residues 64-73 (Fig. 1a). Similar comparisons of the catalytic domain of MMP-1 from complex A with the catalytic domain of procollagenase-1 (PDB code 1SU3 (29Jozic D. Bourenkov G. Lim N.H. Visse R. Nagase H. Bode W. Maskos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9578-9585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)), collagenase-1 (PDB code 1CGL (21Lovejoy B. Cleasby A. Hassell A.M. Longley K.

Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)) resulted in r.m.s.d. values of 0.45, 0.54, and 1.30 Å, respectively. These comparisons (and others for which r.m.s.d. values are not shown) indicate that the catalytic domain in our structure is very similar to the catalytic domains of other known crystal structures of MMP-1. The overall orientation of N-TIMP-1 relative to MMP-1cd is similar to that observed in the TIMP-1·MMP-3cd complex (PDB code 1UEA (11Gomis-Ruth F.X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar)) and the TIMP-2·MT1-MMPcd complex (PDB code 1BQQ (12Fernandez-Catalan C. Bode W. Huber R. Turk D. Calvete J.J. Lichte A. Tschesche H. Maskos K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar)). The three complexes in the asymmetric unit (complexes A, B, and C) superimpose with a mean r.m.s.d. of ∼0.9 Å. Structural alignment of complex A with the TIMP-1·MMP-3cd complex gave an r.m.s.d. of 0.85 Å (272 Cα atoms), whereas alignment with the TIMP-2·MT1-MMPcd complex gave a r.m.s.d. of 1.55 Å (217 Cα atoms). In all these superpositions it was observed that the catalytic domains of the different complexes aligned quite well, whereas the TIMP components exhibited most of the differences. Characteristics of the Interface—N-TIMP-1 recognizes three segments of the catalytic domain of MMP-1: residues 178-186, 218-228, and 238-240 (Fig. 1c). Formation of the complex buries a total of about 1500 Å2 of the solvent-accessible area of the two proteins, about 60% of the interface being contributed by MMP-1cd. In all 18 residues from N-TIMP-1 and 22 residues from MMP-1cd participate in the interface, forming 87 van der Waals contacts (Table 2) and 12 H-bonds (Table 3). The total number of van der Waals contacts observed at the interface is slightly lower than those for the TIMP-1·MMP-3cd and TIMP-2·MT1-MMPcd complexes, although the total number of direct hydrogen-bonding interactions at the interface in the three complexes remains the same. Complex A shares 10 hydrogen bonds with the TIMP-1·MMP-3cd complex and 9 with the TIMP-2·MT1-MMPcd complex; 7 hydrogen bonds are conserved between all three complexes. The majority of all intermolecular contacts is made by the five N-terminal residues (Cys-1-Pro-5) and residues Met-66-Cys-70 from the connector loop (loop connecting strands sC and sD). Residues Cys-1, Thr-2, Glu-67, and Ser-68 make 62% of the van der Waals interactions and 75% of the hydrogen-bonding interactions at the interface.TABLE 2Comparison of van der Waals interactions at the binding interface of N-TIMP-1·MMP-1cd complex (present structure) and TIMP-1·MMP-3cd complex (11) Contact distances are the following maximum allowed values: C-C, 4.1 Å; C-N, 3.8 Å; C-O, 3.7 Å; O-O, 3.3 Å; O-N, 3.4 Å; N-N, 3.4 Å; C-S, 4.1 Å; O-S, 3.7 Å; N-S, 3.8 Å. The contact distances were calculated using CONTACT (19).

https://openalex.org/W2060428701,"Recently, we cloned the ATA/SNAT transporters responsible for amino acid transport system A. System A is one of the major transport systems for small neutral and glucogenic amino acids represented by alanine and is involved in the metabolism of glucose and fat. Here, we describe the cellular mechanisms that participate in the acute translocation of ATA2 by insulin stimulus in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We monitored this insulin-stimulated translocation of ATA2 using an expression system of enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged ATA2. Studies in living cells revealed that ATA2 is stored in a discrete perinuclear site and that the transporter is released in vesicles from this site toward the plasma membrane. In immunofluorescent analysis, the storage site of ATA2 overlapped with the location of syntaxin 6, a marker of the trans-Golgi network (TGN), but not with that of EEA1, a marker of the early endosomes. The ATA2-containing vesicles on or near the plasma membrane were distinct from GLUT4-containing vesicles. Brefeldin A, an inhibitor of vesicular exit from the TGN, caused morphological changes in the ATA2 storage site along with the similar changes in the TGN. In non-transfected adipocytes, brefeldin A inhibited insulin-stimulated uptake of α-(methylamino)isobutyric acid more profoundly than insulin-stimulated uptake of 2-deoxy-d-glucose. These data demonstrate that the ATA2 storage site is specifically associated with the TGN and not with the general endosomal recycling system. Thus, the insulin-stimulated translocation pathways for ATA2 and GLUT4 in adipocytes are distinct, involving different storage sites.

Thus, the insulin-stimulated translocation pathways for ATA2 and GLUT4 in adipocytes are distinct, involving different storage sites. The significance of the muscle and liver in amino acid metabolism has been well recognized and the involvement of these two tissues in amino acid uptake has been investigated in detail (1Brosnan J.T. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 2068S-2072SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). The adipose tissue also possesses multiple amino acid transport systems (2Ritchie J.W. Baird F.E. Christie G.R. Stewart A. Low S.Y. Hundal H.S. Taylor P.M. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 11: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition to the obvious role of amino acids in protein synthesis, available evidence indicates that amino acids may have other important functions in the adipose tissue. Adipose tissue uses amino acids to synthesize fatty acids, triglycerides, and glycerol-based phospholipids (3Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 1199-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 4Palacin M. Lasuncion M.A. Herrera E. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 26-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, amino acids modulate the magnitude of insulin-stimulated translocation of the facilitated glucose transporter GLUT4 (5Bogan J.S. McKee A.E. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 14: 4785-4806Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar), glutamine modulates fat metabolism through a regulatory effect on hexosamine biosynthesis (6Rumberger J.M. Wu T. Hering M.A. Marshall S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28547-28552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and arginine enhances insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis (7Egan J.M. Henderson T.E. Bernier M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E61-E66PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems that amino acid uptake may influence glucose and fat metabolism in adipose tissue. Under physiological conditions, uptake of small neutral and gluconeogenic amino acids such as glutamine and alanine into adipocytes occurs primarily via the amino acid transport system A (2Ritchie J.W. Baird F.E. Christie G.R. Stewart A. Low S.Y. Hundal H.S. Taylor P.M. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 11: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). System A is a Na+-dependent active transport system for neutral amino acids expressed in most tissues (8Christensen H.N. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 173: 576-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A unique characteristic of this system is its ability to recognize N-alkylated amino acids as substrates (9Christensen H.N. Oxender D.L. Liang M. Vatz K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 3609-3616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α-(Methylamino)isobutyric acid (MeAIB) 2The abbreviations used are: MeAIB, α-(methylamino)isobutyric acid; ATA, amino acid transporter A; TGN, trans-Golgi network; 2-DG, 2-deoxy-d-glucose; TfnR, transferrin receptor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BFA, brefeldin A; mATA, mouse amino acid transporter A; RT, reverse transcriptase; BMI, body mass index. is commonly used as a model substrate for system A. Among the various amino acid transport systems known to be expressed in mammalian cells, system A is best known for its regulation (10Haussinger D. Lang F. Kilberg M.S. Mammalian Amino Acid Transport, Mechanisms and Control. Plenum Press, New York1992: 113-130Google Scholar, 11Kilberg M.S. Bracy D.S. Handlogten M.E. Fed.

However, most of the studies investigating the regulatory aspects of this system have been carried out only at the phenomenological level. Very little is known about the molecular events involved in the process. In the past, the lack of appropriate tools such as transporter-specific antibodies and cDNA probes precluded studies on the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of system A. Recently, the molecular identity of amino acid transport system A has been established (13Hatanaka T. Huang W. Ling R. Prasad P.D. Sugawara M. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochim. Biophys.

These studies have identified three distinct transporter proteins that are responsible for system A transport activity in mammalian cells and all three transporters are capable of mediating the Na+-coupled uptake of the system A model substrate MeAIB. The three transporters are known as amino acid transporter A (ATA)1 (also known as SNAT1), ATA2 (SNAT2), and ATA3 (SNAT4). These transporters belong to the solute-linked carrier family SLC38 (21Mackenzie B. Erickson J.D. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 784-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). ATA1 and ATA2 possess similar functional characteristics, but exhibit differential tissue expression patterns. ATA1 is expressed primarily in the placenta and brain, whereas ATA2 is expressed ubiquitously in mammalian tissues. ATA3 is functionally distinguishable from ATA1 and ATA2 and its expression is restricted to the liver. Among these transporters, it is generally believed that ATA2 represents system A, which is known for its regulatory features. There is evidence to indicate that ATA2 corresponds to system A activity in adipocytes (2Ritchie J.W. Baird F.E. Christie G.R. Stewart A. Low S.Y. Hundal H.S. Taylor P.M. Cell. Physiol.

Moreover, whether insulin has any role in the acute regulation of amino acid flux in this tissue is not known. Here, we investigated the cellular events involved in the trafficking of ATA2 in response to insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The present study shows for the first time that the perinuclear storage site for ATA2 is identical to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), that insulin acutely up-regulates system A activity by facilitating the translocation of ATA2 in vesicles from the TGN to the plasma membrane, and that the ATA2-containing vesicles are different from the GLUT4-containing vesicles. Materials—Mouse ATA2 (mATA2) cDNA was cloned from mouse kidney cDNA library using rat ATA2 cDNA as the hybridization probe, as described previously (13Hatanaka T. Huang W. Ling R. Prasad P.D.

CHO-K1 cells were provided by the Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Tohoku University (Sendai, Japan). Cell culture media, Lipofectamine 2000, Alexa 568-conjugated secondary antibodies, and Alexa 568-conjugated phalloidin were purchased from Invitrogen. [14C]MeAIB and l-[14C]tryptophan were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). 2-Deoxy-d-[14C]glucose ([14C]2-DG) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Wortmannin was purchased from Merck Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). Latrunculin A, latrunculin B, and brefeldin A were purchased from Sigma.

The monoclonal antibody against transferrin receptor (TfnR) was from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Cell Culture—3T3-L1 fibroblasts (preadipocytes) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% calf serum, and differentiation was induced according to established protocols (26Bose A. Cherniack A.D. Langille S.E. Nicoloro S.M. Buxton J.M. Park J.G. Chawla A. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5262-5275Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 27Harrison S.A. Buxton J.M.

Briefly, cells were allowed to reach confluence at least 2 days prior to the induction of differentiation. Differentiation was induced (day 0) with high-glucose DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum containing 0.25 μm dexamethasone, 5 μg/ml insulin, and 500 μm methylisobutylxanthine. After 48 h (day 2), the cells were fed with high-glucose DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum containing 5 μg/ml insulin. After an additional 48 h (day 4), the cells were re-fed every 2 days with high-glucose DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum. All media were supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 50 units of penicillin/ml, and 50 μg of streptomycin/ml. Differentiation was monitored by noting the accumulation of lipid droplets, which typically began by day 4 of differentiation. Cells were considered fully differentiated between days 8 and 12. CHO-K1 cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium according to the protocol of the provider. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—ATA isoform-specific oligonucleotide primer pairs were synthesized to match bp 97-107 (ATA1 forward, 5′-ACGACTCTAATGACTTCACAG-3′) and bp 785-764 (ATA1 reverse, 5′-ACTGACTGTCGAGTTCTGCTCC-3′) of the mouse ATA1 sequence (NM 134086), bp 327-347 (ATA2 forward, 5′-AACTACTCATACCCCACCAAG-3′) and 1031-1011 (ATA2 reverse, 5′-AAAGGTGCCGTTCACAGTTTC-3′) of the mouse ATA2 sequence (BC 041108), and bp 1056-1075 (ATA3 forward, 5′-GAGTACGAAGCCCAGGGTGC-3′) and 1773-1754 (ATA3 reverse, 5′-CCCGGGATTAGTGGTGATTG-3′) of the mouse ATA3 sequence (NM 027052). Total RNA was isolated from 3T3-L1 cells and mouse brain and liver using TRI reagent (Sigma) and subsequent protocol. RT-PCR was performed using ReverTraAce (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) and the AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol using the following PCR amplification conditions: 94 °C for 1 min, 56.5 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, repeated for 32 cycles. RT-PCR products were resolved on agarose/Tris acetate/EDTA gel and detected with ethidium bromide under UV light. Uptake Experiments—Prior to uptake experiments, 3T3-L1 cells were fed serum-free DMEM for 4 h, and then incubated with or without insulin (1 μm) in uptake buffer (pH 7.4) for 30 min. Because we wanted to obtain the maximal effect of insulin for MeAIB uptake, we used 1 μm insulin according to the previous report showing that insulin concentration with the saturated maximal effect was several hundred nm (24Su T.Z. Wang M. Syu L.J. Saltiel A.R. Oxender D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3173-3179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The uptake buffer was 25 mm Tris/HEPES (pH 8.0), for MeAIB (14Hatanaka T. Huang W. Wang H. Sugawara M. Prasad P.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochim. Biophys.

The uptake experiment was performed in 3T3-L1 cells at 37 °C for 30 min with [14C]MeAIB, [14C]2-DG, or l-[14C]tryptophan as the substrate. The concentration of the radiolabeled substrate was 3.6, 10, and 30 μm for MeAIB, 2-DG, and l-tryptophan, respectively. The culture medium was removed by aspiration, and the cells were washed once with the uptake buffer. 0.25 ml of uptake buffer containing radiolabeled substrate (MeAIB, 2-DG, or l-tryptophan) was added to the wells and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Uptake was terminated by aspirating the buffer and subsequently washing the cells twice with ice-cold fresh uptake buffer. The cells were then lysed with 0.25 ml of 1% SDS in 0.2 n NaOH, and the lysate was transferred to scintillation vials for quantification of radioactivity. Carrier-mediated uptake of the substrate was calculated by subtracting the uptake measured in the presence of an excess amount of unlabeled substrate (10 mm) from the uptake measured in the absence of unlabeled substrate. Transient Expression and Characterization of EGFP-tagged ATA2 in CHO-K1 Cells—CHO-K1 cells that transiently express mATA2 tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were established using the BD Living Colors pEGFP vector system from Clontech. The full-length cDNA of mATA2 was subcloned into the pEGFP-C2 vector. We have named this construct EGFP-ATA2. CHO-K1 cells were plated onto 24-well plates 1 day before transfection. EGFP-ATA2 cDNA was transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine 2000. The expression of EGFP-ATA2 protein in CHO-K1 cells was evaluated by confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy and Western blot with the anti-GFP antibody. The functional activity of the expressed EGFP-ATA2 protein was monitored by measurements of MeAIB uptake. Stable Expression of EGFP-tagged ATA2 in 3T3-L1 Cells— 3T3-L1 cells that stably express EGFP-ATA2 protein were also established using the BD Living Colors pEGFP vector system (Clontech). EGFP-ATA2 vector was introduced into 3T3-L1 preadipocytes using Effectene reagent from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The transfected cells were cultured in a medium that contained G418 (Sigma). After 2 weeks of culture, cells that formed single colonies were isolated, and stored individually. After that, we screened these stable cell lines for their ability to differentiate into adipocytes, and used only those that could differentiate for the subsequent experiments. We also verified by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis that all the cells expressed EGFP. We have named this cell line EGFP-ATA2 3T3-L1 cells. Biotinylation of Cell Surface Proteins—Biotinylation of cell surface proteins was performed by the method described by Rotmann et al. (28Rotmann A. Strand D. Martine U. Closs E.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54185-54192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) for the study of the internalization of the cationic amino acid transporter with slight modifications. Briefly, the preadipocytes stably expressing EGFP-ATA2 protein were grown to confluence and differentiated into adipocytes in 10-cm dishes. After the experimental treatment, the cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS+), and incubated in the same solution supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidobiotin (EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin: Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were then rinsed with the Quenching Solution in the Cell Surface Protein Biotinylation and Purification Kit (Pierce) once and Tris-buffered saline twice to quench any unbound biotin. The cells were then lysed by the addition of 1 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA free: Roche Diagnostics) for 30 min at 4 °C. After removal of the cellular debris, protein concentrations of the lysates were determined using the Bradford method. 1 mg of the lysate proteins were batch-extracted overnight at 4 °C using avidin-coated agarose beads (immobilized NeutrAvidin, Pierce), and then released from the beads by incubation in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.001% bromphenol blue, 5 min at 95 °C). Western Blot Analysis—Lysate proteins and cell surface proteins were separated in 8% SDS-PAGE and then blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membranes were blocked with 10% skim milk, and probed with diluted primary antibodies (1:1000-2000) at 4 °C overnight. The bound antibodies were detected with diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000-10000) at room temperature for 1 h. Signals were visualized using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of signals was carried out using Scion Image imaging software. The values of signal intensity in the cell surface protein blot were normalized with those in the total lysate blot. Imaging of Movement of EGFP-ATA2-containing Vesicles in Living Cells—The preadipocytes, which stably express EGFP-ATA2 protein, were grown to confluence, differentiated into adipocytes on a glass-bottom dish, and imaged by a specially devised incubation microscope (LCV100, Olympus Co., Ltd., Tokyo, and SANYO Electric Biomedical Co., Ltd., Tokyo). This device possesses the fluorescence microscopy capability to monitor fluorescence in living cells under normal culture conditions (temperature 36.8 ± 0.2 °C, humidity 90% or more, and CO2 5%). Simultaneous GFP and differential interference contrast images were collected at intervals of 4 min for time lapse experiments. The cells were visualized with a ×40 objective lens (UAP040X/340, NA 0.9, Olympus) using standard filter sets and a mercury lamp. Sequential images were acquired with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (DP30BW, Olympus) with a 600-ms exposure time every 4 min. The images with several focuses along the z axis were acquired to catch the images depicting the movement of puncta or vesicles from the perinuclear site during insulin stimulation. Data were analyzed using Metamorph software from Universal Imaging Corp. (Downingtown, PA). Immunofluorescent Analysis and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—3T3-L1 adipocytes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. Coverslips were incubated with diluted primary antibodies (1:200-500) for 1 h and with diluted Alexa 568-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200) in 2% skim milk, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.02% SDS, PBS for 30 min. Images were taken with upright confocal laser scanning microscope LSM5 PASCAL (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). ATA2 Is Mostly Responsible for Uptake of MeAIB in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes and Preadipocytes—To confirm whether ATA2 mRNA is mainly expressed in 3T3-L1 cells, we performed RT-PCR using mouse-specific ATA1, ATA2, and ATA3 primers (Fig. 1A). We used total RNA of mouse brain and liver as positive control samples for detection of ATA1 and ATA2/3, respectively, according to our previous reports (13Hatanaka T. Huang W. Ling R. Prasad P.D.

Commun. 2000; 273: 1175-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The results from positive controls show that all three primer pairs function appropriately. 3T3-L1 adipocytes and preadipocytes generated the expected 705-bp PCR fragment for ATA2. In contrast, ATA1 mRNA was not detected. ATA3 mRNA was detected at very low levels in preadipocytes, compared with ATA2. As a negative control, an equal volume of water replaced reverse transcriptase in the RT-PCR, and no amplified products were obtained (results not shown). Insulin Stimulates Carrier-mediated MeAIB Uptake in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes Partially by the Phosphatidylinositol 3′-Kinase-Actin Polymerization Signal Pathway—We first confirmed that acute treatment of adipocytes with insulin increases system A activity, as monitored by the Na+-dependent uptake of MeAIB, without involving de novo synthesis of the transporter protein (Fig. 1B, MeAIB). After the insulin stimulus, carrier-mediated uptake of MeAIB was markedly increased, uptake activity in insulin-treated cells being twice as that in untreated cells. Under identical conditions, insulin also stimulated the carrier-mediated uptake of 2-DG, attributable mainly to GLUT4 activity, to the level of more than 700% of control (Fig. 1B, 2-DG). Carrier-mediated uptake of l-tryptophan, an amino acid that is not recognized by system A, was not affected by insulin (Fig. 1B, l-Trp). We then investigated the molecular events involved in stimulation of MeAIB uptake by insulin. The insulin-stimulated uptake of MeAIB was inhibited to less than 30% of control by 100 nm wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, whereas the insulin-stimulated uptake of 2-DG was blocked almost completely under identical conditions (Fig. 1C). Treatment of the cells with 0.2 μg/ml latrunculin A and 1 μg/ml latrunculin B, specific inhibitors of actin polymerization, decreased the insulin-stimulated MeAIB uptake to 40 and 30% of control, respectively. Under identical conditions, the insulin-stimulated uptake of 2-DG was reduced to 70% of control (Fig. 1D, a). To confirm that the treatment condition of latrunculin A and B is appropriate, we undertook immunohistochemical staining of the actin filament (Fig. 1D, b-d). The images show these reagents actually disrupted the actin structure as reported previously (29Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42436-42444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Similar results for MeAIB uptake were obtained with 3T3-L1 undifferentiated preadipocytes (Fig. 1E). Characterization of EGFP-tagged ATA2 Transiently Expressed in CHO-K1 Cells—To carry out the cell biological approach for direct observation of ATA2 translocation stimulated by insulin, we first constructed the plasmid for EGFP-tagged mATA2 (EGFP-ATA2), transfected the construct into CHO-K1 cells, and evaluated the expression and function of the fusion transporter, because CHO-K1 cells show much higher transfection efficiency and lower basal ATA activity than 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipocytes. Furthermore, there is information available in the literature for the transfection of the myc- and GFP-tagged GLUT4 constructs into CHO-K1 cells (5Bogan J.S. McKee A.E. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 14: 4785-4806Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). EGFP tagging is a powerful tool to observe the molecular traffic, especially in real time; however, we have to make certain that the tagging does not perturb the native function and property of the molecule, especially in a case of membrane proteins. Because of the lack of a good antibody against ATA2 to detect endogenous ATA2 protein in 3T3-L1 cells, we analyzed the property of the EGFP-ATA2 construct by three criteria: first, the EGFP signal is membrane-associated, not diffuse or aggregative; second, the construct produces appropriate molecular weight bands detected in the Western blot; and third, the construct retains the native transporter activity in the cells. Localization of EGFP-ATA2 protein was evaluated with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Fig. 2A). EGFP-ATA2 was localized primarily on the plasma membrane, whereas EGFP was expressed uniformly throughout the cytoplasm in CHO-K1 cells. The expression of the fusion protein was also evaluated by Western blot using an anti-GFP antibody with cell lysates (Fig. 2B). We detected a major band at an approximate size of 74 kDa only with the lysate of CHO-K1 cells transfected with EGFP-ATA2. This band was not detected with the lysate of non-transfected control cells. We also evaluated the transport function of the EGFP-tagged transporter by measuring the uptake of MeAIB (Fig. 2C). The uptake was 80% higher in cells transfected with the EGFP-mATA2 plasmid compared with cells transfected with the control EGFP plasmid. Thus, this construct successfully met the three criteria, establishing the appropriateness of the EGFP-ATA2 fusion transporter for further studies using stable expression in 3T3-L1 cells. Insul"

T7 gp2.5-Δ26C, lacking 26 acidic C-terminal residues, also reduces the melting force but at considerably lower concentrations.

T7 gp2.5-Δ26C binding to single-stranded DNA also exhibits a stronger salt dependence than the full-length protein.

Optical tweezers have been used extensively for studying the biomechanical properties of single DNA molecules by stretching the molecules and measuring the required force for a given extension under various conditions (1Bustamante C.

The mechanical work performed by stretching has an energy scale of the non-covalent interactions that hold the two DNA strands together (7Rouzina I. Bloomfield V.A. Biophys.

When this mechanical process is reversible, the calculated work is equal to the equilibrium melting free energy (7Rouzina I. Bloomfield V.A. Biophys.

Res. 2002; 35: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).The method of ssDNA stretching in which two strands are melted by force is referred to as force-induced melting (FIM). This method provides valuable information regarding the interaction between nucleic acids and proteins or small molecules that bind to DNA (9Williams M.C. Rouzina I. Bloomfield V.A. Acc. Chem. Res. 2002; 35: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In the experiments described here, a single λ-DNA molecule of 48,500 base pairs was stretched to extensions that were almost twice its B-form contour length, resulting in a FIM transition. Extended regions of dsDNA melt cooperatively, and the midpoint of the melting transition, Fm,is analogous to the DNA melting temperature, Tm, obtained in thermal melting studies. Fm, like Tm, is similarly affected by solution conditions such as pH, temperature, and ionic strength (5Wenner J.R. Williams M.C. Rouzina I. Bloomfield V.A. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 3160-3169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 9Williams M.C. Rouzina I. Bloomfield V.A. Acc. Chem.

DNA-binding proteins and small molecules that affect the thermal melting equilibrium of dsDNA affect the FIM transition in a similar manner (9Williams M.C. Rouzina I. Bloomfield V.A. Acc. Chem. Res. 2002; 35: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 11Pant K. Karpel R.L. Williams M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Vladescu I.D. McCauley M.J. Rouzina I. Williams M.C. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2005; 95: 158102Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). One advantage of the FIM method is that DNA melting studies can be performed over a wide range of temperatures, including physiological temperature, thus avoiding protein denaturation. In addition, because the DNA is stretched during the single molecule experiment, measurements can be obtained under solution conditions that would allow the protein-DNA complex to aggregate in a bulk solution experiment.In previous work, we used DNA stretching to probe the interactions of T4 gene 32 protein (gp32) to ssDNA. We used this method to determine the association constant of gp32 to ssDNA over a range of salt concentrations, including physiological conditions (11Pant K. Karpel R.L. Williams M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Pant K. Karpel R.L. Rouzina I. Williams M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that the association constant of wild type gp32 exhibited very little salt dependence below 200 mm Na+, in contrast to bulk experiments, which had previously shown a very strong salt dependence in high salt. A C-terminal truncation of gp32, denoted *I, does not show salt-independent binding at low salt. We proposed that the lack of salt dependence to wild type gp32-ssDNA binding in low salt was due to a conformational change involving the acidic C-terminal domain of gp32, which may be required for gp32-ssDNA binding (18Rouzina I. Pant K. Karpel R.L. Williams M.C. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 1941-1956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 19Williams M.C. Rouzina I. Karpel R.L. Curr. Org.

Because this conformational change begins to strongly alter gp32 binding near physiological salt concentrations, we had previously proposed that the C-terminal domain of gp32 may act as a regulatory switch. The presence of an acidic C terminus is a common feature of all prokaryotic and mitochondrial ssDNA-binding proteins, which have been shown to modulate the DNA binding properties of the proteins and mediate protein-protein interactions (20Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). However, the replication systems that contain these proteins may differ substantially. For example, the T7 replication system is very economical and can be reconstituted in vitro with only four proteins: DNA polymerase with its processivity factor, thioredoxin, the helicase/primase, and the ssDNA-binding protein, which are involved in multiple protein-protein interactions within the phage replisome. In contrast, T4 phage replication employs a different set of replication proteins, as well as several additional accessory proteins. The differences in complexity between these two systems suggest the possibility of more sophisticated coordination between the DNA binding properties of the single-stranded binding protein from T7, gp2.5, and the protein-protein interactions with other T7 replication proteins. Therefore, we now present a single molecule study of salt-dependent ssDNA binding by the single-stranded DNA-binding protein from bacteriophage T7 in order to examine the differences between the DNA binding activities of T4 gp32 and T7 gp2.5.Bacteriophage T7 gene 2.5 protein (gp2.5), encoded by gene 2.5 of the bacteriophage T7, is a ssDNA-binding protein (21Chase J.W. Williams K.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 103-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). It physically interacts with both T7 DNA polymerase and the T7 helicase/primase (22Kim Y.T. Tabor S.

In the absence of DNA, gp2.5 forms a stable homodimer in solution (35Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15022-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

The crystal structure of gp2.5 reveals a core that consists of a conserved OB-fold (oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide-binding fold) that is well adapted for interactions with ssDNA. gp2.5 has a highly acidic C-terminal tail that is required for dimer formation and for interactions with T7 DNA polymerase and the helicase/primase (39Hollis T. Stattel J.M. Walther D.S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9557-9562Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A genetically altered protein, gp2.5-Δ26C, lacks the C-terminal 26 residues. gp2.5-Δ26C binds ssDNA more tightly than does the full-length protein (22Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Churchich J.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15032-15040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Models have been proposed in which the C-terminal tail of gp2.5 interacts with the DNA-binding core of the protein (39Hollis T. Stattel J.M. Walther D.S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9557-9562Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 40Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).We utilize DNA stretching to investigate the effects of full-length gp2.5 as well as gp2.5-Δ26C on DNA duplex stability and melting. In accord with the known preferential binding to ssDNA, both proteins reduce the melting force. However, the differences between force-extension curves during stretching and relaxation, (i.e. stretching hysteresis), in the presence of both proteins indicates that the system does not reach equilibrium on the time scale of our experiment. The technical limitations of our instrument made it difficult to pull slowly enough to reproduce the complete equilibrium DNA stretching curve. Therefore, we measured the equilibrium force at the midpoint of the DNA melting transition, at the extension corresponding to the melting of half of the base pairs. To do this, we rapidly stretched the dsDNA to a fixed end-to-end extension halfway between the dsDNA and ssDNA contour lengths and monitored the force, which converged to equilibrium at this given extension, on the time scale of several minutes. We then calculated the equilibrium binding constants of the protein to ssDNA from the protein concentration dependence of the measured equilibrium DNA melting force (7Rouzina I. Bloomfield V.A. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 882-893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 8Rouzina I. Bloomfield V.A. Biophys.

Biol. 2005; 349: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).We found that the binding affinity of the full-length gp2.5 and its C-terminal truncation for exposed ssDNA regions were salt-dependent and differed by several orders of magnitude in low salt. To explain this difference in binding affinity, we developed a model in which a salt-dependent dimerization interaction must be broken in order for gp2.5 to bind to DNA. We then quantified this binding interaction as a function of salt concentration; herein we discuss its relevance to gp2.5 interactions with other T7 replication proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Preparation and Purification—Wild type gp2.5 and gp2.5-Δ26C were purified from BL21(DE3)pLysS cells overexpressing a histidine-tagged version of their genes as described previously (40Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Following the purification the histidine tag was proteolytically cleaved using PreScission protease (glutathione S-transferase-tagged, Amersham Biosciences). The cleaved histidine tag and the protease were subsequently removed using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and GSTTrap™ HP columns, respectively. The purified proteins were dialyzed against storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 0.1 EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol) and stored at -20 °C. The storage buffer for gp2.5-Δ26C contained additional 150 mm NaCl. For experiments requiring high concentrations of gp2.5, the protein solution was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device (Millipore) with 10-kDa cut-off.DNA Stretching—The dual-beam optical tweezers instrument used in this study consists of two counter-propagating diode lasers, each with 200 milliwatts of 830 nm light (JDS Uniphase, San Jose, CA) that are convergently directed and focused to a small spot inside a liquid flow cell, using ×60, 1.0 numerical aperture water immersion microscope objectives (Nikon, Tokyo) that form the optical trap. The light leaving the trap is directed onto a lateral effect photodiode detector (UDT Sensors, Hawthorne, CA), which determines the deflection of each beam and outputs a voltage that is directly proportional to the force being exerted on the bead in the optical trap.To tether single DNA molecules, two 5-μm streptavidin-coated polystyrene beads (Bangs Laboratories, Fishers, IN) were trapped in the optical tweezers and on the end of a glass micropipette (World Precision Instrument, Sarasota, FL). A very dilute solution containing bacteriophage λ-DNA (∼ 48,500 base pairs, biotin-labeled on each 3′ terminus), typically in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and varying NaCl concentrations, was run through the cell until one molecule was captured between the two beads. The flow cell, and thus the glass micropipette, may be moved using a feedback-compensated piezoelectric stage (Melles Griot), causing the single DNA molecule to stretch between two beads, resulting in a force measurement, as described previously (10Williams M.C. Wenner J.R. Rouzina I. Bloomfield V.A. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 874-881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The position measurements were converted to a measurement of the molecular extension by correcting for the trap stiffness. To obtain measurements of DNA helix destabilization, the DNA was stretched in 100-nm steps and then held at a constant position while the resulting force as a function of time was measured. After capturing a single DNA molecule in the tethering buffer, the molecule was stretched to verify that the usual force-extension curve was obtained and that only a single molecule had been tethered. To measure the effect of the protein on this transition, 4 to 5 cell volumes of a buffer solution containing a fixed amount of protein was added to the experimental cell until the buffer surrounding the captured DNA molecule had been completely exchanged.RESULTSQuantifying ssDNA Binding Affinity by Single Molecule Stretching—To probe the effect of these proteins on duplex DNA destabilization, we measured the force-extension curve of λ-DNA in the presence and absence of gp2.5 and gp2.5-Δ26C, a deletion mutant lacking 26 C-terminal amino acids, over a range of salt and protein concentrations. Typical results of our measurements in 50 mm Na+ buffer are shown in Fig. 1. In the absence of protein, the DNA melting force is independent of pulling rate (12Pant K. Karpel R.L. Rouzina I. Williams M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 851-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and shows very little hysteresis. gp2.5 (7 μm) and gp2.5-Δ26C (300 nm) significantly lower the melting force relative to that observed in the absence of protein. However, much higher concentrations of gp2.5 compared with gp2.5-Δ26C are required to observe a significant reduction in the melting force. Although this behavior is expected for a protein that binds preferentially to ssDNA, this is the first observation of natural DNA denaturation in the presence of gp2.5. When the DNA was relaxed, the relaxation curves did not match the stretching curves, as shown by the dashed lines in Fig. 1. The considerable hysteresis shows that protein dissociation from exposed regions of ssDNA and subsequent DNA reannealing upon relaxation is slower than the 4-min duration of a stretching and relaxation cycle. In addition, lower rates of DNA stretching resulted in lower melting forces, signifying that the protein-ssDNA association and dissociation were slow on the time scale of the force-induced DNA melting.Ideally, if we were able to pull slowly enough, we should be able to measure the complete equilibrium DNA stretching curve in the presence of the “slow” protein. However, our optical tweezers instrument does not allow pulling slower than 5-10 nm/s because of a position drift on longer time scales. Instead, we could measure the equilibrium force at the midpoint of the DNA melting transition. To this end, we rapidly stretched the dsDNA to a fixed end-to-end extension halfway between the dsDNA and ssDNA contour length and monitored the force, which converges to an equilibrium value, over a time scale of several minutes. This approach was used previously for equilibrium studies of T4 gene 32 protein interactions with DNA (11Pant K. Karpel R.L. Williams M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Pant K. Karpel R.L. Rouzina I. Williams M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Typical results obtained in 25 mm Na+ buffer are given in Fig. 2. After rapid stretching to the transition midpoint, the force decreased exponentially with time, representing additional DNA melting due to protein binding. The time-dependent force data can be fit to the following relation, F(t)stretch=Fm+(Fk-Fm)exp(-tτmelt)(Eq. 1) where Fm is the equilibrium force obtained at long times, Fk is the initial melting force (the subscript k indicates that this kinetically determined force likely depends on pulling rate), and the constant τmelt is the time for DNA melting due to protein binding. To measure the equilibrium force during the DNA renaturation, the DNA molecule was first stretched through the DNA melting transition and then relaxed quickly to the midpoint of the transition, and the change in force in the presence of each protein was monitored for at least 15 min. The observed force increased exponentially, representing DNA reannealing due to protein dissociation. The time-dependent force data upon relaxation were fit to an expression analogous to Equation 1. The fact that both denaturation and renaturation experiments converge to the same force, denoted by Fm, clearly demonstrates that the melting force obtained in the experiment outlined in Fig. 2 represents the equilibrium DNA melting force.FIGURE 2Time dependence of the DNA stretching force at the midpoint of the melting transition in the absence of protein (black) and in the presence of 10 μm gp2.5 (red) and 80 nm gp2.5-Δ26C (blue) as well as the time dependence of DNA renaturation in which the DNA molecule has been overstretched and relaxed back to the same position in the presence of 10 μm gp2.5 (light orange) and 80 nm gp2.5-Δ26C (light blue). Data were taken in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 25 mm Na+ (20 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaOH).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As illustrated by Fig. 3, increasing amounts of either protein results in a lower DNA melting force, reflecting progressive protein-induced duplex destabilization. Below we use these data to determine the protein-DNA association constants of both proteins. The shift in the DNA melting temperature due to protein binding can be related to the protein-DNA binding constants to dsDNA and ssDNA as follows (41McGhee J.D. Biopolymers. 1976; 15: 1345-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), 1Tm0-1Tm=kBΔHln{(1+KdsC)1/nds(1+KssC)1/nss}(Eq. 2) where nss, nds, Kss, and Kds are the binding site size in nucleotides and binding constants of the protein to ssDNA and dsDNA, respectively, and C is the bulk protein concentration. The change in DNA melting temperature and force due to duplex destabilization by protein can be related via general thermodynamics by the relation, ΔGdestabilization=(Fm-Fm0)Δx=(Tm-Tm0)ΔS(Eq. 3) where ΔS and Δx are the difference in entropy and extension per base pair between the protein-bound ssDNA and dsDNA, Tm0 , Tm, Fm0 , and Fm are the melting temperature and force in the absence and presence of protein, respectively, and ΔGdestabilization is the change in DNA melting free energy per base pair induced by protein binding. Combining Equations 2 and 3, using the relationship ΔH = ΔSTm0 , and taking into the account that gp2.5 is a single-stranded binding protein, i.e. that Kss >> Kds (35Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15022-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we can find the shift in melting force due to protein binding as follows. Fm≈Fm0-2kBTnssΔxln(1+KssC)(Eq. 4) By fitting the melting force as a function of concentration to Equation 4, we obtain a measurement of Kss under the desired solution conditions. Below, we use this to examine the salt dependence of gp2.5 and gp2.5-Δ26C association to ssDNA.FIGURE 3a, the measured DNA equilibrium melting force as a function of protein concentration, Fm(C), for gp2.5.

To perform this fit, we used our measured difference in length per base pair Δx between the dsDNA and ssDNA from the stretching curves for ssDNA in the presence of gp2.5-Δ26C in 0.005 m Na+ buffer. This length change was not expected to depend significantly on ionic strength (8Rouzina I. Bloomfield V.A. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 894-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Furthermore, by using the salt-independent parameter nss = 7 from the work of Kim et al. (35Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15022-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the salt-dependent value of DNA melting in the absence of the protein, Fm0 , from the work of Wenner et al. (5Wenner J.R. Williams M.C. Rouzina I. Bloomfield V.A. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 3160-3169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), we obtained the best fit to our data, which resulted in finding the binding constants for both proteins to ssDNA in different salt concentrations extended from 5 mm Na+ to 50 mm Na+ for gp2.5 and 25 mm Na+ to 100 mm Na+ for gp2.5-Δ26C.As shown in Fig. 4, the C-terminal truncation of gp2.5 binds ssDNA about 100-fold stronger than the wild type gp2.5 in 100 mm Na+ salt, in accord with previous data (35Kim Y.T.

However, previous data were limited to a single measurement of Kss = 1.2 × 106 m-1 at 50 mm NaCl for gp2.5 by fluorescence quenching (35Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15022-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) compared with our measured value of (3.5 ± 0.6) × 105 m-1 at the same salt concentration. Similarly, previous data were limited to a single measurement of Kss = 3 × 107 m-1 at 50 mm KCl for gp2.5-Δ26C by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (38Hyland E.M. Rezende L.F. Richardson C.C. J.

For the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we used the value obtained for binding to 70-base oligonucleotides as determined from the “slow mobility” lane of the gel. For this lane, the measured wild type gp2.5 value for Kss agrees well with that measured in the earlier fluorescence quenching assay (35Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J.

https://openalex.org/W2033574285,"Inositol polyphosphates perform essential functions as second messengers in eukaryotic cells, and their cellular levels are regulated by inositol phosphate kinases. Most of these enzymes belong to the inositol phosphate kinase superfamily, which consists of three subgroups, inositol 3-kinases, inositol phosphate multikinases, and inositol hexakisphosphate kinases. Family members share several strictly conserved signature motifs and are expected to have the same backbone fold, despite very limited overall amino acid sequence identity. Sequence differences are expected to play important roles in defining the different substrate selectivity of these enzymes. To investigate the structural basis for substrate specificity, we have determined the crystal structure of the yeast inositol phosphate multikinase Ipk2 in the apoform and in a complex with ADP and Mn2+ at up to 2.0A resolution. The overall structure of Ipk2 is related to inositol trisphosphate 3-kinase. The ATP binding site is similar in both enzymes; however, the inositol binding domain is significantly smaller in Ipk2. Replacement of critical side chains in the inositolbinding site suggests how modification of substrate recognition motifs determines enzymatic substrate preference and catalysis."

Thus, there exists a considerable interest in unraveling the mechanistic basis of the broad neutralizing activity of mAb4E10. The epitope core 671NWF(D/N)IT676 recognized by mAb4E10 locates at the center of the gp41 664DKWASLWNWFNITNWLWYIK683 sequence. This sequence has been defined as a distinct domain according to its interfacial hydrophobicity (designated as pre-transmembrane (preTM)) (2Suárez T. Gallaher W.R. Agirre A. Goñ F.M. Nieva J.L. J.

Specifically, this domain would be involved in the expansion of the fusion pores (6Muñoz-Barroso I. Salzwedel K. Hunter E. Blumenthal R. J.

However, the structural grounds sustaining this activity are poorly understood due in part to the fact that a gp41 ectodomain atomic structure including the membrane-proximal region is not available at present. Our analyses predicted a membrane interfacial location of the sequence as a monomer (2Suárez T. Gallaher W.R. Agirre A. Goñ F.M. Nieva J.L. J.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9570-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) further demonstrated that the preTM peptide adopts a well defined helical conformation in the membrane-like environment provided by dodecylphosphocholine micelles. In addition, nuclear Overhauser effects between side chains and polar head groups suggested that aromatic residues would position within the interfacial bilayer region (Fig. 1B). Infrared (IR) spectroscopy and fluorescence measurements were compatible with the existence of helical monomers or oligomers in phospholipid bilayers depending on peptide load and lipid composition (3Sáez-Cirión A.

Subsequent x-ray diffraction data obtained by Cardoso et al. (14Cardoso R.M. Zwick M.B. Stanfield R.L. Kunert R. Binley J.M. Katinger H. Burton D.R. Wilson I.A. Immunity. 2005; 22: 163-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) have indeed revealed a helical structure for a 13-residue preTM derivative in complex with Fab4E10. Finally, preTM appears to bind directly cholesterol (Chol) through its C-terminal cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus LWYIK sequence (15Epand R.F. Sayer B.G. Epand R.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5525-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), a phenomenon that might condition gp41 fusogenic function (16Epand R.F. Thomas A. Brasseur R. Vishwanathan S.A. Hunter E. Epand R.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6105-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of the predicted preTM interfacial location has recently received support from the cryoelectron microscopy tomography study by Roux and co-workers (17Zhu P. Liu J. Bess J. Chertova E. Lifson J.D. Grisé H. Ofek G.A. Taylor K.A. Roux K.H. Nature. 2006; 441: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). This study has revealed that gp41 stalk regions project as “legs” from the trimeric Env complex in intact virions, with their “feet” just above the plane of the envelope (tripod-like structure). Docking of the Fab-bound atomic structures into the surface model suggests that Env native preTM would actually locate at the viral surface, inserted as a monomer in parallel to the external membrane monolayer. Thus, it is inferred that mAb4E10 bears the capacity to recognize native-like epitope sequences associated to the viral membrane interface. In this work we test this prediction by assessing the capacity of mAb4E10 to recognize and block preTM peptides inserted into lipid vesicles and monolayers. Specifically, we have compared the effects on recognition of sphingomyelin and cholesterol, the two raft-lipids postulated to be predominant at the virion external monolayer (18Aloia R.C. Jensen F.C.

Our studies support the notion that 4E10 paratope is structurally designed to allow recognition of preTM species stabilized by cholesterol at the virion external membrane-interface. Moreover, we propose that recognition might render cross-linked spikes incompetent for fusion. These observations might be important for the design of immunogens aimed at recovering 4E10-like protective responses. Materials—The sequences DKWASLWNWFNITNWLWYIK (preTM), representing the pre-transmembrane stretch of HIV-1 (BH10 isolate) gp41, and its fluorescent derivative (Rho-preTM), labeled with rhodamine at its N terminus, were synthesized by solid-phase synthesis using Fmoc chemistry as its C-terminal carboxamide and purified by high performance liquid chromatography at the Proteomics Unit of the University Pompeu-Fabra (Barcelona, Spain). Peptide stock solutions were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) (spectroscopy grade), and concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid microassay (Pierce). Neutralizing antibody expressing hybridomas were generated by a combined polyethylene glycol electrofusion of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HIV-infected non-symptomatic patients (21Buchacher A. Predl R. Strutzenberger K. Steinfellner W. Trkola A. Purtscher M. Gruber G. Tauer C. Steindl F. Jungbauer A. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1994; 10: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Neutralizing antibodies 2F5 and 4E10 were produced in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells after a subclass switch to IgG1 (9Kunert R. Wolbank S. Stiegler G. Weik R. Katinger H. AIDS Res. Hum.

Bioeng. 2000; 67: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), Chol, sphingomyelin (SPM), and the fluorescent probes N-(7-nitro-benz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)phosphatidylethanolamine (N-(NBD)-phosphatidylethanolamine) and N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)phosphatidylethanolamine were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). The N-(5-dimethylaminonaphtalene-1-sulfonyl)-1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine), 8-aminonaphtalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid sodium salt (ANTS), and p-xylenebis(pyridinium)bromide (DPX) fluorescent probes and the goat anti-human IgG antibody labeled with Alexa-Fluor 488 were from Molecular Probes (Junction City, OR). Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBCD) and sphingomyelinase (from Bacillus cereus) were from Sigma. Production of Lipid Vesicles—Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were prepared following the extrusion method of Hope et al. (23Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar) in 5 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) buffer. Lipid concentrations of liposome suspensions were determined by phosphate analysis (24Böttcher C.S.F. van Gent C.M. Fries C. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1961; 24: 203-204Crossref Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Extraction of cholesterol from the vesicles was performed using MBCD as previously described (25Ohvo-Rekilä H. Akerlund B. Slotte J.P. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2000; 105: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26John K. Kubelt J. Muller P. Wustner D. Herrmann A. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1525-1534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Fluorimetric Assays—Release of vesicular contents to the medium was monitored by the ANTS/DPX assay (27Ellens H. Bentz J. Szoka F.C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3099-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). LUV containing 12.5 mm ANTS, 45 mm DPX, 20 mm NaCl, and 5 mm Hepes were obtained by separating the unencapsulated material by gel filtration in a Sephadex G-75 column eluted with 5 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.4). Osmolarities were adjusted to 200 mosmol in a cryoscopic osmometer (Osmomat 030, Gonotec, Berlin, Germany). Fluorescence measurements were performed by setting ANTS emission at 520 nm and excitation at 355 nm. A cutoff filter (470 nm) was placed between the sample and the emission monochromator. The 0% leakage corresponded to the fluorescence of the vesicles at time 0; 100% leakage was the fluorescence value obtained after the addition of Triton X-100 (0.5%, v/v). Membrane lipid mixing was monitored using the resonance energy transfer assay, described by Struck et al. (28Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). The assay is based on the dilution of N-(NBD)-phosphatidylethanolamine and N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)phosphatidylethanolamine. Dilution due to membrane mixing resulted in an increased N-NBD-phosphatidylethanolamine fluorescence. Vesicles containing 0.6 mol % of each probe were mixed with unlabeled vesicles at a 1:4 ratio (final lipid concentration, 0.1 mm). The NBD emission was monitored at 530 nm with the excitation wavelength set at 465 nm. A cutoff filter at 515 nm was used between the sample and the emission monochromator to avoid scattering interferences. The fluorescence scale was calibrated such that the zero level corresponded to the initial residual fluorescence of the labeled vesicles, and the 100% value corresponded to complete mixing of all the lipids in the system. The latter value was set by the fluorescence intensity of vesicles, labeled with 0.12 mol % of each fluorophore, at the same total lipid concentration as in the fusion assay. Kinetics of peptide partitioning into the membrane interface was evaluated measuring energy transfer from Trp residues to the surface fluorescent probe N-(5-dimethylaminonaphtalene-1-sulfonyl)-1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine as in Ruiz-Argüello et al. (29Ruiz-Argüello M.B. Goñi F.M. Pereira F.B. Nieva J.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1775-1781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 6 mol % of N-(5-dimethylaminonaphtalene-1-sulfonyl)-1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine probe was included in the target vesicle composition, and its emission was collected in time at the wavelength of 510 nm. The excitation wavelength was that of the Trp residue (280 nm). Monolayer Penetration—Surface pressure was determined in a fixed-area circular trough (μTrough S system, Kibron, Helsinki). Measurements were carried out at room temperature and under constant stirring. The aqueous phase consisted of 1 ml of 5 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.4). Lipid mixture dissolved in chloroform was spread at the surface at the initial surface pressure (π0) of 25 mN/m. Peptide was subsequently injected into the subphase with a Hamilton microsyringe until the surface pressure reached a value of ∼32 mN/m. Finally, the antibody was injected into the subphase, and changes in surface-pressure were recorded in time. Planar Supported Phospholipid Layers—Phospholipid monolayers were spread from chloroform/methanol 3:1 (v/v) solutions ontoa5mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl subphase in a thermostatted Langmuir-Blodgett trough (NIMA Technologies, Coventry) as previously described (3Sáez-Cirión A.

After 10 min, to allow for solvent evaporation, monolayers were compressed at 25 cm2/min up to 32 mN/m and then transferred onto a glass coverslip at 5 mm/min. Lipid/Rho-PreTM monolayers were prepared by adding the proper volume of a Me2SO solution of the peptide to the chloroform/methanol lipid mixtures used in monolayer spreading. Epifluorescence microscopy observation of the planar supported monolayers was performed with a Zeiss Axioplan II fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, D). Antibody was injected into the aqueous subphase and incubated for 30 min before transferring the monolayer to the solid support. Images from Alexa-Fluor-labeled antibody, and rhodamine-labeled peptide were recorded separately by switching fluorescence filters to select the proper emission wavelength range. Images presented in the figures were false-colored to show them as they look under the microscope. All experiments were carried out at 24 °C. Fig. 1A displays the average interfacial hydrophobicities of HIV-1 gp41 ectodomain and mAb4E10 heavy chain (top and bottom plots, respectively). The gp41 sequence displays a prominent hydrophobic region comprising the aromatic-rich pre-TM 664-683 sequence. The core 4E10 epitope sequence lies in the center of the preTM stretch. Therefore, mAb4E10 is predicted to recognize a sequence that may stably reside at membrane interfaces. The mAb4E10 plot below displays two hydrophobic peaks (colored in black) that correspond to loop sequences containing exposed aliphatic and aromatic residues in the heavy chains (14Cardoso R.M.

These two loops have been postulated to establish direct interactions with the membrane, a process that might help with recognition of the membrane-inserted epitope stretch (14Cardoso R.M. Zwick M.B.

Fig. 1, panel B, compares the atomic structures of a preTM-derived sequence resolved by Cardoso et al. (14Cardoso R.M. Zwick M.B. Stanfield R.L. Kunert R. Binley J.M. Katinger H. Burton D.R.

(13Schibli D.J. Montelaro R.C. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9570-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) (blue chain). The helical structure is the main conformation in both cases. However, the relative orientation of the aromatic residues is different. Specifically the Phe-673 (red side chain) is buried into a hydrophobic pocket of the Fab binding site, whereas the side chain of this residue projects toward the hydrocarbon core of the bilayer in the membraneinterface residing species. The different orientations and insertion levels suggest that the potential recognition of the membrane interface residing preTM by mAb4E10 should result in blocking of its membrane restructuring capacity. mAb4E10 Effects on PreTM-induced Membrane Restructuring—Results displayed in Figs. 2 and 3 confirmed that mAb4E10 was able to block PreTM-induced membrane restructuring in Chol-containing vesicles. We have previously reported that the PreTM peptide perturbs vesicles made of lipids that resemble the raft-like composition of HIV-1 external membrane monolayer (3Sáez-Cirión A. Nir S. Lorizate M.

In particular, PreTM peptide partitions almost quantitatively into POPC:SPM:Chol (1:1:1) vesicles and induces the release of the encapsulated solutes (3Sáez-Cirión A. Nir S. Lorizate M. Agirre A. Cruz A. Pérez-Gil J. Nieva J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21776-21785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, the addition of mAb4E10 alone to these vesicles did not induce any appreciable ANTS release, suggesting that the antibody was not able to destabilize the lipid bilayer on its own. However, antibody addition before PreTM efficiently reduced the ANTS leakage induced by the peptide. The inhibitory effect was dose-dependent and more effective at low peptide-to-lipid ratios, suggesting that the process was directly dependent on antibody recognition (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 3Distinct effects of SPM and Chol on the membrane-restructuring blocking capacity of mAb4E10.

Accordingly, ANTS leakage kinetics reproduced the time-course required for selfaggregation and pore assembly at the membrane surface. Thus, this process may comprise a potential means for testing antibody recognition of membrane-bound species. mAb4E10 addition to vesicles undergoing permeabilization also arrested the pore formation (Fig. 2C). The PreTM peptide lacks the complete ELDKWA epitope sequence required for efficient mAb2F5 recognition, and this antibody could not arrest the leakage process (b trace). This observation reinforces the idea that blocking of membrane-bound species competent for membrane destabilization depended on specific 4E10 epitope recognition. Membrane restructuring could not be completely arrested in the previous samples, suggesting the existence of a peptide fraction not accessible to the antibody. In our previous contribution we showed that raft lipids SPM and Chol promoted different PreTM species in membranes (3Sáez-Cirión A. Nir S. Lorizate M. Agirre A. Cruz A. Pérez-Gil J. Nieva J.L. J.

When mixed with POPC, SPM sustained pore-formation, whereas Chol also promoted fusion activity, a phenomenon that we interpreted as indicative of transmembrane and interfacial topologies. Therefore, the role of each raft lipid in the blocking-at-membrane processes was next analyzed separately using POPC:Chol (2:1) and POPC: SPM (1:1) vesicles (Fig. 3A).

X-ray crystallography revealed that the CXXC motif, through its network of hydrogen bonds, plays a crucial role in orienting the substrate optimally for catalysis. In all structures, there were changes in the structure of the β-turn preceding the CXXC motif when compared with wild type protein. The N-terminal loop between residues 15 and 32 is flexible in the oxidized and mutant enzymes, the disorder greater in the oxidized protein. Disordering of the N-terminal loop disrupts the integrity of the side chain binding pocket, particularly for the branched chain side chain, less so for the dicarboxylate substrate side chain. The kinetic studies of the mutant and oxidized enzymes support the structural analysis. The kinetic results showed that the predominant effect of oxidation was on the second half-reaction rather than the first half-reaction. The oxidized enzyme was completely inactive, whereas the mutants showed limited activity. Model building of the second half-reaction substrate α-ketoisocaproate in the pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate-hBCATm structure suggests that disruption of the CXXC center results in altered substrate orientation and deprotonation of the amino group of pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate, which inhibits catalysis.

In humans, there are two isozymes, a mitochondrial (hBCATm) and a cytosolic (hBCATc) form (1Yennawar N. Conway M.E. Yennawar H.P. Farber G.K. Hutson S.M.

The BCAT and transamination reactions of other pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes follow a ping-pong Bi-Bi reaction (7Christen P. Metzler D. Transaminases. 2.

(Tokyo). 1994; 116: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In the first half-reaction, the PLP form of BCAT reacts with the branched chain amino acid, and the reaction proceeds through a Michaelis complex, an external aldimine, quinonoid intermediate, ketimine, and finally the PMP form of the BCAT and the branched chain α-keto acid product. In the Michaelis complex, the α-amino group of the substrate must be deprotonated to form a new Schiff base with PLP. The migration of the proton on the α-amino group of the substrate to the short contact pair between the α-carboxylate and the phosphate of PLP reduces the electrostatic repulsion between the pair and renders the α-amino group of the substrate deprotonated (6Goto M. Miyahara I. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. Hirotsu K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3725-3733Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The second half-reaction is the reverse of the first half-reaction. Structurally PLP-dependent enzymes are classified into five distinct fold types (fold types I-V) (13Schneider G. Kack H. Lindqvist Y. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: R1-R6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 14Mehta P.K. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Jensen R.A. Gu W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2161-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The BCATs are fold type IV proteins and are the only mammalian enzymes in this fold type (1Yennawar N. Conway M.E. Yennawar H.P. Farber G.K. Hutson S.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11592-11601Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 2Hutson S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

The BCAT isozymes have similar substrate specificity; however, they exhibit subtle differences in steady state kinetic parameters, substrate preferences, and differences in sensitivity to chemical denaturing agents (3Davoodi J.

Hutson S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3092-3098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second characteristic of the mammalian BCATs is the presence of a consensus sequence CXXC motif (17Yennawar N. Dunbar J. Conway M. Hutson S. Farber G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 506-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Conway M.E. Yennawar N. Wallin R. Poole L.B. Hutson S.M.

In mitochondrial hBCATm, these cysteines can participate in a thiol-thiolate interaction and are responsible for the redox sensitivity of the enzyme (1Yennawar N. Conway M.E. Yennawar H.P. Farber G.K. Hutson S.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11592-11601Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17Yennawar N. Dunbar J. Conway M. Hutson S. Farber G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 506-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The cysteines of the CXXC center (Cys315 and Cys318) can form a disulfide bond in the presence of an oxidizing agent. Cys315 is the sensor, whereas Cys318 acts as the “resolving cysteine,” permitting reversible formation of a disulfide bond (19Conway M.E. Poole L.B. Hutson S.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7356-7364Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). hBCATm enzyme activity is affected by the reduction state of the CXXC center. The reduced protein is fully active (3Davoodi J. Drown P.M. Bledsoe R.K. Wallin R. Reinhart G.D. Hutson S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4982-4989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 19Conway M.E. Poole L.B. Hutson S.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7356-7364Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), whereas the oxidized enzyme is inactive (18Conway M.E. Yennawar N. Wallin R. Poole L.B. Hutson S.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9070-9078Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 19Conway M.E. Poole L.B. Hutson S.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7356-7364Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). hBCATc activity is less affected by oxidation of its CXXC center (20Goto M. Miyahara I. Hirotsu K. Conway M. Yennawar N. Islam M.M. Hutson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37246-37256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Prokaryotic BCATs do not contain the CXXC structural motif (6Goto M. Miyahara I. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. Hirotsu K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3725-3733Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The structural and kinetic basis for the influence of the CXXC center on hBCAT catalysis is not known. To understand the molecular basis for catalytic inactivation of hBCATm by oxidation of the CXXC center and the structural role of this motif in hBCATm catalysis, we have solved the x-ray crystallographic structure of oxidized mitochondrial hBCATm, the C315A, C318A, and C315A/C318A mutants. Structural changes include an altered hydrogen bonding pattern concomitant with changes in the net turn dipole moment at the beta turn preceding the CXXC motif, altered flexibility of the interdomain loop, a change in the conformation of one of the residues lining the substrate binding pocket, and changes in the mode of substrate binding as a consequence of a mutation. These structural changes result in kinetic inactivation of the second half-reaction due to improper positioning of the α-keto acid substrate in the active site. Chemicals—HEPES buffer was obtained from Fisher. l-Leucine, l-Isoleucine, l-Valine, l-Glutamate, all α-keto acids, N-methylleucine, dithiothreitol (DTT), β-mercaptoethanol, PLP, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside were purchased from Sigma. The bacterial growth medium contained 0.5% yeast extract, 1% polypeptone, and 0.5% NaCl and was from Fisher. The pET-28a vector was from Novagen (Madison, WI), and bacterial strain Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) was from Promega. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was purchased from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA). All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. Protein Purification—The overexpression and purification of the hBCATm proteins for crystallization studies were performed according to the method of Conway et al. (18Conway M.E. Yennawar N. Wallin R. Poole L.B. Hutson S.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9070-9078Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For kinetic studies, the procedure was modified. Briefly, the pET-28a expression vector containing the hBCATm cDNA was transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells. The E. coli were cultivated in LB medium containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 100 μm pyridoxine-HCl. The histidine-tagged proteins were extracted and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The histidine tag was removed by digestion with thrombin (100 National Institutes of Health units) at 30 °C for 1 h followed by buffer exchange into the storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm α-ketoisocaproate, and 5 mm glucose). Purified hBCAT proteins were filtered using a 0.22-μm filter and stored at -20 °C in 30% glycerol in the storage buffer. The mutant proteins are as stable as wild type hBCATm (WT-hBCATm). Radioactive hBCATm Assay—The radioactive hBCATm assay was performed as described previously (18Conway M.E. Yennawar N. Wallin R. Poole L.B. Hutson S.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9070-9078Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The activity of the enzyme was measured at 37 °C in 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.8 with 5 mm DTT, using 1 mm α-keto[1-14C]isovalerate and 12 mm isoleucine. A unit of enzyme activity was defined as 1 μmol of valine formed/min at 37 °C. The reported values are the average of three independent assays. Preparation of the PMP Form of hBCATm—The purified enzyme is in the PLP form. To convert hBCATm to the PMP-form, 100 nmol of purified hBCATm protein were exchanged into 50 mm NaHEPES (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 m KCl and 0.1 mm EDTA and incubated with 20 mm leucine for 15 min at 25 °C. The leucine was removed using a PD-10 column as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). The protocol was then repeated. Conversion to the PMP form was confirmed spectrophotometrically, and hBCATm activity was determined using a spectrophotometric assay (see below). The specific activity of PMP-hBCATm was the same as the specific activity of the PLP form of the enzyme. Preparation of the Oxidized Form of hBCATm—Oxidation of hBCATm was conducted by incubation with hydrogen peroxide at 25 °C. A 60 μm solution of the enzyme was first exchanged into 50 mm KHEPES (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 m KCl and 0.1 mm EDTA using a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). Enzyme (50 μm) was incubated with 500 μm hydrogen peroxide for 2 h. Then the enzyme reaction mix was exchanged into the same buffer without hydrogen peroxide. The activity of oxidized hBCATm was 1.5 units/mg of protein compared with the reduced hBCATm activity of 106 units/mg of protein (99.5% inhibition). Loss of the free cysteines as a result of disulfide bond formation was determined by 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) titration (18Conway M.E. Yennawar N. Wallin R. Poole L.B. Hutson S.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9070-9078Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Preparation of WT and Mutant Enzymes—Site-directed mutagenesis for the single mutants C315A and C318A and double mutant C315A/C318A were performed according to the QuikChange kit protocol. The pET-28a plasmid, carrying the human cDNA gene for BCATm, was used as the template for the desired mutations. Primer design, PCR, expression, and purification of the proteins were described previously (19Conway M.E. Poole L.B. Hutson S.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7356-7364Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein contains four additional residues (GSHM) at the amino terminus. These residues were not well defined in the electron density map and are not included in the deposited structures. Mass spectroscopy was used to confirm the molecular masses of the mutants and the oxidized proteins. Determination of Protein Concentration—The concentrations of WT and mutant hBCATm proteins were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm and at pH 8.0. Molar extinction coefficients used were ϵ = 67,600 m-1 cm-1m for the PLP -1 cm-1 form of the enzyme and ϵ = 67,500 mm for the PMP form of the enzyme. The calculation was based on the contribution of tryptophan and tyrosine residues to the apparent molar absorption at 280 nm, and the estimated ϵM was 5800 m-1 cm-1 and 1450 m-1 cm-1 for tryptophan and tyrosine, respectively. The ϵM for the coenzyme moiety was determined from the absorption change upon binding of coenzyme to apoenzyme, which was 2000 m-1 cm-1 for PLP and 700 m-1 cm-1 for PMP, respectively. Sulfur Chemistry and Thiol Oxidation—DTNB titration was performed to quantify the free thiol groups in hBCATm. The molar extinction coefficient of 13,600 m-1 cm-1 for 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate (TNB) was used for all calculations (19Conway M.E. Poole L.B. Hutson S.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7356-7364Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A 20 mm DTNB stock solution was prepared, and reactions were performed in 50 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, for 20 min at room temperature. Final DTNB concentrations were always in 100-fold molar excess over the thiol concentration. Kinetic Analysis—Fast reaction kinetics were performed using a stopped-flow SX.17MV spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). Enzyme (concentration 40 μm after mixing) and varied concentrations of each substrate were reacted in 50 mm NaHEPES at pH 8.0, 0.1 m KCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Time-resolved spectra were collected using the SX.17MV system equipped with a photodiode array accessory and the XScan (version 1.0) controlling software (Applied Photophysics). The reaction temperature was set at 25 °C using a circulating water bath to maintain a constant temperature in the water jackets surrounding the mixing syringes and the mixing cell. Enzyme (80 μm) and substrate were placed in different syringes, and the reaction was initiated by injecting the fresh enzyme into a mixing chamber at a 1:1 ratio. The dead time was 2.0 ms under a pressure of 600 kilopascals. The absorption maximum was fixed depending on the observed transient spectral changes. Photomultiplier voltage was controlled automatically, and the times used to measure absorption changes were determined experimentally. The apparent rate constant (kapp) for the monoexponential absorption changes was calculated with the program provided with the instrument at 418 nm. For each sample, a minimum of three rate constants were collected to minimize the error. The nonlinear least square fitting of the collected data were performed, and the obtained kapp values were fit to the following equation using IGOR Pro software (WaveMatrics Inc.) using nonlinear regression analysis, kapp=kcat[S]/(Kd+[S])(Eq. 1) where kcat and Kd are the turnover number and substrate dissociation constants for the “half” reactions, respectively, and [S] is the substrate concentration. The direct titrations of the substrates with the enzymes were performed using a Beckman Coulter DU-800 spectrophotometer at 25 °C equipped with a Beckman Coulter temperature controller. The enzyme was exchanged into 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0, KOH) buffer containing 5 mm DTT using a PD-10 column, and the enzyme concentration was adjusted to 30 μm. Substrates were added, and spectral changes were determined. The equilibrium constants (Keq) for hBCATm substrate reactions were evaluated by monitoring the absorption maximum changes at 418 nm and fitting the values to the following equation by nonlinear regression analysis (21Toney M.D. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1471-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), A0=Ai+Aα-Ai×Keq+S+E-Keq+S+E2-4SE2E(Eq. 2) where Ao is the observed absorbance, Aα and Ai are the fitted values of the initial and final absorbance, respectively, [S] is the substrate concentration, and [E] is the enzyme concentration. All calculations and analyses were performed using IGOR Pro software (WaveMatrics). Crystallization, Soaking, and Data Collection—Crystals of the mutants of human recombinant hBCATm were obtained using the vapor diffusion method of hanging drops at room temperature similar to the wild type protein reported earlier (1Yennawar N. Conway M.E. Yennawar H.P. Farber G.K. Hutson S.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11592-11601Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17Yennawar N. Dunbar J. Conway M. Hutson S. Farber G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 506-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The drop consisted of 5 μl of protein solution and 5 μl of the reservoir. The drop was equilibrated against 1 ml of the reservoir. The protein solution contained 2.5 mg/ml mutant proteins in a solution of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 20 mm DTT, and 50 mm EDTA. Yellow crystals grew in grids set up with the wild type crystallization condition containing 22-30% polyethlylene glycol 1500, 100 mm HEPES (pH 6.9-7.2), and 20 mm DTT. Some of the crystals were in the monoclinic form, space group P21, and some in the orthorhombic form with space group P212121 symmetry. There was a dimer in the asymmetric unit in both forms (Table 1).TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsData parametersC315AC315A + N-methylleucineC318AC315A/C318AOxidized hBCATmProtein Data Bank code2HGX2HG82HGW2HDK2HHFUnit cella (Å)58.73859.17969.66859.48058.123b (Å)109.904109.278105.585112.187104.183c (Å)59.58959.449106.59960.26558.264β (degrees)96.51297.23090.00096.156100.722Space groupP21P21P212121P21P21Resolution range (Å)25-1.8030-1.8030-1.9825-2.4030-1.80Integrated reflections262,574225,772292,060115,409183,535Independent reflections69,06464,19954,31728,48958,070Data completeness (%)99.892.497.993.292.0Average I/average σ(I)25.112.717.59.8614.7R-factor (%)4.97.49.010.77.7R-factor (working)%/No. of reflections20.8/65,53625.1/60,89022.7/50,39618.1/24,96625.1/55,034R-factor (free) %/No. of reflections23.1/333028.2/316625.2/262423.6/185028.3/2886No. of protein atoms57405740571957945684No. of water molecules374337172146209No. of cofactor atoms3030303030Other molecules3 acetates and 1 HEPES1 acetate and N-methylleucine10 acetates, 1 HEPES, 1 glycerol, and 1 sulfate1 acetate and 1 α-ketoiso caproate1 HEPESRoot mean square deviation bond lengths (Å)0.010.010.010.020.01Root mean square deviation bond angles (degrees)1.51.61.62.032.06Average B-factor (Å)2, protein19.225.333.129.424.3α-Ketoisocaproate/methylleucine/HEPES40.434.846.337.845.2Waters/acetates/glycerol/sulfate25.431.136.429.525.8 Open table in a new tab For data collection, the crystals were first soaked in a solution of the crystallization condition having 10% glycerol added to it so as to get a glassy freeze. The crystals were picked up with a loop (Hampton research nylon loop, size 0.5 mm) and frozen directly in the liquid nitrogen cold stream. In order to see the complex with N-methylleucine, the crystals were soaked in the crystallization solution with an excess amount of the substrate mimic. The crystals did not change color from yellow to clear with time, indicating that N-methylleucine forms the Michaelis complex with the mutant proteins. In order to solve the structure of the oxidized protein, the protein crystals obtained under standard conditions were incubated with the standard crystallization buffer without DTT and with the addition of 3% hydrogen peroxide. The crystals were flash frozen as described above. The following hBCATm structures are reported here: 1) hBCATm C315A single mutant (Protein Data Bank code 2HGX); 2) hBCATm C315A single mutant Michaelis complex with N-methylleucine (C315A-NML) (Protein Data Bank code 2HG8); 3) hBCATm C318A single mutant (Protein Data Bank code 2HGW); 4) hBCATm C315A/C318A double mutant as a Michaelis complex with α-ketoisocaproate (Protein Data Bank code 2HDK); 5) oxidized hBCATm (hBCATm-Ox) with Cys315 and Cys318 as a disulfide (Protein Data Bank code 2HHF). Diffraction data for the crystals were collected to 1.8 Å resolution at the synchrotron source in Cornell university, on beam line F1 with a 2 × 2 array CCD detector, using 0.91609 Å wavelength radiation monochromatized with a double crystal Si(111). DENZO and SCALEPACK (22Otowinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) were used to reduce the data. Crystal data are listed in Table 1. Structure Determination—The molecular replacement method was used to solve the mutant crystal structures with the earlier solved PLP form as the search probe in the program AMoRe (23Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar), part of the CCP4 program suite (24Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The program CNS (25Brunger A. Adams P. Clore G. DeLano W. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

The slow cool protocol was used to minimize model bias, and O (26Jones T. Kjeldgaard M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 27Kleywegt G. Jones T. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 208-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) was used for examination and manual adjustment of the structure during the refinement. Several cycles of positional refinement and isotropic B-factor refinement were performed after every model building cycle. Electron density maps confirmed the mutated side chains (Fig. 1). The pyridoxal phosphate was removed from the initial refinement cycles to get an unbiased view of the active site. Toward the end of the refinement, σ-weighted difference Fourier maps and 2Fo - Fc maps clearly showed the changes that had occurred at the active site as a result of the mutation. The cofactor is covalently linked to the active site lysine, Lys202, in all of the mutant structures. In the N-methylleucine soaked crystals of C315A enzyme (C315A-NML), the active site density maps indicated that the N-methylleucine has bound as a Michaelis complex in both the monomers. In the oxidized enzyme (hBCATm-Ox), Cys315 and Cys318 are seen to be part of a disulfide (Fig. 1A). Cys108, which is on the surface of the enzyme and does not affect hBCATm activity (19Conway M.E. Poole L.B. Hutson S.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7356-7364Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), is overoxidized to the sulfonic acid. The N terminus loop, residues 15-32, is disordered in monomer A and cannot be traced. In monomer B, the conformation of Phe30 has changed significantly. A HEPES molecule is stabilized with its cyclohexyl ring in the substrate binding pocket, and the sulfate end plugs the access to the active site. In the double mutant C315A/C318A structure, an α-ketoisocaproate molecule is seen tightly bound as a Michaelis complex in the active site of one of the monomers (Fig. 5). α-Ketoisocaproate is present in the enzyme storage buffer. In the single mutant C318A, a HEPES molecule is seen bound on the surface of the protein. In monomer B, a sulfate ion occupies the substrate backbone carboxylate site. In monomer A, two acetate molecules are seen in the substrate backbone carboxylate and glutamate side chain distal carboxylate binding site. In the structure of the N-methylleucine-bound C315A mutant, an acetate molecule is seen bound in the latter site in both of its monomers. A HEPES molecule is seen on the surface of the protein in this mutant as well. Water molecules were automatically located using CNS (25Brunger A. Adams P. Clore G. DeLano W. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N. Read R. Rice L. Simonson T. Warren G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Acetate, HEPES, and glycerol molecules were modeled manually into σ-weighted (2Fo - Fc) maps. The refinement parameters with the R-factors and average B-factors of the various structures are listed in Table 1.

https://openalex.org/W2112748367,"The specific intracellular inhibition of protein activity at the protein level is a highly valuable tool for the validation or modulation of cellular processes. We demonstrate here the use of designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) as tailor-made intracellular proteinase inhibitors. Site-specific proteolytic processing plays a critical role in the regulation of many biological processes, ranging from basic cellular functions to the propagation of viruses. The NIapro proteinase of tobacco etch virus, a major plant pathogen, can be functionally expressed in Escherichia coli without harming the bacterium. To identify inhibitors of this proteinase, we first selected binders to it from combinatorial libraries of DARPins and tested this pool with a novel in vivo screen for proteinase inhibition. For this purpose, a hybrid protein consisting of the ω subunit of E. coli RNA polymerase was covalently fused to a DNA-binding protein, the λcI repressor, containing an NIapro cleavage site in the linker between the two proteins. Thus, this transcriptional activator is inactivated by site-specific proteolytic cleavage, and inhibitors of this cleavage can be identified by the reconstitution of transcription of a reporter gene. Following this two-step approach of selection and screening, we could rapidly isolate NIapro proteinase inhibitors active inside the cell from highly diverse combinatorial DARPin libraries. These findings underline the great potential of DARPins for modulation of protein functionality in the intracellular space. In addition, our novel genetic screen can help to select and identify tailor-made proteinase inhibitors based on other protein scaffolds or even on low molecular weight compounds.

In addition, our novel genetic screen can help to select and identify tailor-made proteinase inhibitors based on other protein scaffolds or even on low molecular weight compounds. Selective inhibition of protein activity inside the cell is of fundamental importance for the investigation of biological processes as well as for the drug discovery process. Experimental approaches to achieve this goal have become increasingly available through the use of genetic knockouts and small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of target proteins (1Dove A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, these techniques knock out the expression of the entire gene of interest and are thus not able to discriminate, e.g. between the different functions of protein variants originating from the same gene (2Lo Conte L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). Moreover, the effect mediated by RNA interference is often only weak, especially if the cellular stability of the protein of interest is high, as only the de novo synthesis is (partially) inhibited. Recent studies have also demonstrated that RNA interference effects are not always specific for the targeted gene (3Sledz C.A. Holko M. de Veer M.J. Silverman R.H. Williams B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar, 4Jackson A.L. Bartz S.R. Schelter J. Kobayashi S.V. Burchard J. Mao M. Li B. Cavet G. Linsley P.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 635-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar, 5Bridge A.J. Pebernard S. Ducraux A. Nicoulaz A.L. Iggo R. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 263-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). The use of inhibitory molecules directly acting at the protein level is thus a complementary approach. This strategy allows the targeting of single functions residing in different domains of multidomain protein complexes or those due to post-translational modifications. An important consideration is also that such proteinaceous inhibitors may be used in the subsequent characterization of the corresponding target protein in vitro or may even serve as first leads in the drug discovery process. Intracellular proteinases are important regulators of signal transduction, RNA transcription, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and development (6Sices H.J. Kristie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2828-2833Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 7Vanaman T.C. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and many other processes, and they are also used by viruses in the processing of polyprotein precursors (8Dougherty W.G. Semler B.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 781-822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To elucidate their function early in the discovery process, specific small molecule inhibitors will usually not be available, and thus a rapid approach to generate specific inhibitors that function inside the cell would be very valuable. One way of approaching this challenge would be to use artificial proteinase inhibitors based on proteins. Although a large number of protein families have been used by nature for this purpose (10Rawlings N.D. Morton F.R. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D270-D272Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), the great majority of these inhibitors are secreted proteins and contain disulfide bonds. Thus, they work naturally on secreted proteinases and, consequently, have been re-engineered to target extracellular proteinases (9Skerra A. J. Mol. Recognit. 2000; 13: 167-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Even though there are also natural intracellular proteinase inhibitors controlling many of the processes mentioned above (10Rawlings N.D. Morton F.R. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D270-D272Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), they have not been used as scaffolds for deriving new specificities up to now. Another approach would be to use scaffolds that are not derived from proteinase inhibitors for this purpose. The generation of novel inhibitors is difficult, because polypeptides are first and foremost substrates of proteinases. The challenge is thus to achieve selective binding without cleavage or by maintaining a stable complex between proteinase and inhibitor even after cleavage of the latter. An antibody scFv fragment that works in the reducing intracellular milieu (11Sun J. Pons J. Craik C.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 892-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) has been reported for this purpose. However, because these molecules also rely on disulfide bonds for stability (12Biocca S. Ruberti F. Tafani M. Pierandrei-Amaldi P. Cattaneo A. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 1110-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 13Ewert S. Honegger A. Plückthun A.

Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), they may not provide a general solution for this kind of application. We therefore wished to investigate whether another class of proteins, repeat proteins, can be engineered to act as proteinase inhibitors. We previously reported the generation of designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) 3The abbreviations used are: DARPin, designed ankyrin repeat protein; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; NIapro, potyvirus nuclear inclusion-a proteinase (25 kDa, not containing the viral genome-linked protein domain VPg); RNAP, RNA polymerase; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; TEV, tobacco etch virus; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. as specific binding molecules, and we also showed that they can be selected for intracellular enzyme inhibition, demonstrated for a bacterial kinase (15Forrer P. Stumpp M.T. Binz H.K. Plückthun A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 2-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 16Binz H.K. Amstutz P. Kohl A. Stumpp M.T. Briand C. Forrer P. Grütter M.G. Plückthun A.

Chem. 2005; 280: 24715-24722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), but it was unclear whether they would contain the properties required for proteinase inhibition. Repeat proteins constitute the largest group of natural proteins specialized in binding. They can be found across all phyla, in the intra- and extracellular space, mediating a diverse set of biological functions (18Bork P. Proteins. 1993; 17: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 19Andrade M.A. Perez-Iratxeta C. Ponting C.P. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 134: 117-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 20Kobe B. Kajava A.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). DARPins feature consecutive homologous structural units (repeats) of 33 amino acids, which stack to build up a single folded polypeptide. The elongated repeat domain can be of variable size, depending on the number of repeats, and it displays a rather rigid target-binding surface that can accommodate many different surface residues adaptable to specifically bind a wide range of targets. By structural and sequence consensus analysis of this modular architecture of natural repeat proteins, we constructed highly diverse combinatorial DARPin libraries (15Forrer P. Stumpp M.T. Binz H.K. Plückthun A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 2-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 21Forrer P. Binz H.K. Stumpp M.T. Plückthun A.

Biol. 2003; 332: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). These libraries consist of an N-terminal capping repeat, a defined number (typically 2 or 3) of engineered randomized internal repeats, and a C-terminal capping repeat (denoted an N2C and an N3C library; Fig. 1) in a single protein chain, and the molecules assume the ankyrin fold. The theoretical diversity exceeds 1014 for the N2C library and 1023 for the N3C library (22Binz H.K. Stumpp M.T. Forrer P. Amstutz P. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Unselected members of these libraries show very favorable biophysical properties (16Binz H.K. Amstutz P. Kohl A. Stumpp M.T. Briand C. Forrer P. Grütter M.G. Plückthun A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 22Binz H.K. Stumpp M.T. Forrer P. Amstutz P. Plückthun A. J. Mol.

DARPins do not rely on disulfide bonds for their stability, nor do they contain free cysteines. Furthermore, they do not show structural similarities to known naturally occurring proteinaceous inhibitors. Here, we investigated whether DARPins can be selected to inhibit the main proteinase responsible for virus maturation of an agriculturally important plant virus, the NIapro proteinase of tobacco etch virus (TEV). NIapro is the main proteinase of potyvirus; it is responsible for two-thirds of all cleavage reactions occurring during the viral infection cycle, and its functionality is vital for successful virus propagation (25Carrington J.C. Dougherty W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3391-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 26Carrington J.C. Dougherty W.G. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2540-2548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Carrington J.C. Dougherty W.G. Virology. 1987; 160: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our aim to identify DARPin-based proteinase inhibitors was further encouraged by recent findings that naturally occurring proteinase inhibitors could mediate resistance against potyviruses in transgenic plants (28Gutierrez-Campos R. Torres-Acosta J.A. Saucedo-Arias L.J. Gomez-Lim M.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1223-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In addition, NIapro is structurally highly homologous to the 3C proteinases of the picornavirus family, which are the major cause of numerous human diseases worldwide (29Wang Q.M. Prog. Drug Res. 2001; (Spec. No.): 229-253PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, this proteinase can be expressed in functional form in Escherichia coli without harm to the cell, as its highly specific cleavage reaction does not seem to destroy vital E. coli proteins. To accomplish our task, we applied a two-step approach of in vitro selection for binding, followed by in vivo activity screening. Although many assays exist to study proteinase activity in vitro (30Billich A. Hammerschmid F. Winkler G. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1990; 371: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 31Matayoshi E.D. Wang G.T. Krafft G.A. Erickson J.

A. 1991; 88: 5159-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), these assays either need purified protein or they lack ease of handling. Therefore, we adapted a known bacterial two-hybrid system (35Dove S.L. Hochschild A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) to serve as an in vivo proteinase activity screen. We were able to select and characterize in vivo active proteinaceous DARPin NIapro inhibitors. The potential of DARPins as a basis for proteinase inhibition and as a general intracellular target validation tool is discussed.

In turn, pZA21-TEV was constructed by inserting the PCR-amplified gene of the catalytic domain, NIapro, into pZA21 (37Lutz R. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar), thereby replacing its KpnI/BamHI fragment. The gene of the catalytic domain NIapro was amplified from pRK793 (38Kapust R.B. Waugh D.S. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1668-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). pBRcI-T-ω is a derivative of pBRcI-ω (35Dove S.L. Hochschild A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) containing a NIapro cleavage site. pMAKcI-T-ω-pD is a derivative of pQI-pD (39Stumpp M.T. Designing Repeat Proteins: From Leucine-rich Repeat Proteins to Ankyrin Repeat Proteins. University of Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland2004Google Scholar) and constitutively expresses the λcI-T-ω fusion protein under control of the β-lactamase promoter Pbla. pMAKcI-T-ω-DL is a derivative of pMAKcI-T-ω-pD in which the pool of DARPins enriched by ribosome display, binding NIapro, replaces phage λ protein D (gpD). Expression of the DARPin pool is under control of the IPTG-inducible promoter PT5/lac. It was used in all in vivo screening experiments. The open reading frames of the ribosome display-selected DARPins were digested with NcoI and HindIII and ligated into pMAKcI-T-ω-pD, yielding the selection plasmid ready for in vivo screening. The pMAKcI-T-ω-DL tag is a derivative of pMAKcI-T-ω-DL and was used for the DARPins 9_1s, 13_1b, 20_2b, and E2_5 in the Western blot experiments. In this vector the DARPin genes lack their N-terminal RGS-His6 tag. pAT223-TEV is a derivative of pAT223 and was used for the expression of His-tagged biotinylated and nonbiotinylated gpD-NIapro fusion protein. Protein Production and Purification—The biotinylated fusion protein pD-NIapro and biotinylated pD alone (plasmids pAT223_TEV and pAT222) were produced by in vivo biotinylation of the N-terminal Avi tag (40Schatz P.J.

Efficient biotinylation was confirmed by ELISA and Western blotting using a streptavidinalkaline phosphatase conjugate as detection agent (Roche Applied Science) and by mass spectrometry. Nonbiotinylated pD-NIapro for the ELISA analysis was produced in the same way as the DARPin proteins (22Binz H.K. Stumpp M.T. Forrer P. Amstutz P. Plückthun A. J. Mol.

In Vitro Selection with Ribosome Display—The DARPin library generation has been described (22Binz H.K. Stumpp M.T. Forrer P. Amstutz P. Plückthun A. J. Mol.

In this study, an N2C and an N3C DARPin library were used, encoding DARPins consisting of a constant N-terminal capping repeat, two or three internal designed ankyrin repeats, respectively, containing randomized residues, and a constant C-terminal capping repeat as a continuous polypeptide chain. The PCR-amplified libraries in the ribosome display format were transcribed in vitro, and four standard ribosome display selection rounds were carried out as described (16Binz H.K. Amstutz P. Kohl A.

In Vivo Screening—The pools of NIapro binders selected by ribosome display from selection round three and four, starting from the N2C and the N3C library, were combined and ligated into pMAKcI-T-ω-pD, thereby replacing phage λ protein D (gpD) and generating pMAKcI-T-ω-DL, co-introduced with pZA55-TEV into E. coli KS1ΔZ (35Dove S.L. Hochschild A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and plated on LB agar plates containing 1% glucose, 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 20 μg/ml tetracycline, 0.2% arabinose, 20 μg/ml X-gal, and 20-25 μm IPTG. Cells were grown at 30 °C overnight and checked for blue color development after various times. pMAKcI-T-ω-DL clones were isolated from different blue colonies and re-introduced together with pZA55-TEV into fresh E. coli KS1ΔZ cells, and the screening step was repeated to confirm the phenotype and to eliminate false positives. The DNA of those clones confirmed twice as positive was sequenced using standard DNA sequencing. Size-exclusion Chromatography—Immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography-purified DARPins were analyzed on a Superdex 200 HR gel-filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) at room temperature using a SMART chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 60 μl/min. TBS150 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) was used as running buffer. ELISA—The biotinylated antigens (pD or pD-NIapro) were immobilized as follows: neutravidin (66 nm, 100 μl/well; Pierce) in TBS150 was immobilized on a Maxisorp plate (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) by overnight incubation at 4 °C. The wells were then blocked with 300 μl of 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) in TBS150 for 1 h at room temperature. Biotinylated antigen (100 μl; 1 μm) in TBS150 with 0.5% bovine serum albumin was allowed to bind for 1 h at 4°C. To test whether the binding of the selected DARPins was specific for NIapro, 100 μl of purified DARPins (1 μm) were applied to wells with or without immobilized antigen for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing with TBS150, binding was detected with an anti-RGS-His antibody (Qiagen; detects only the N-terminal RGS-His6 tag of the DARPin but not the internal (pD-NIapro) or C-terminal (pD) His6 tag of the antigen), an anti-mouse-IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Pierce), and p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Fluka). For competition ELISA, the purified DARPins were incubated with 5 μm of free NIapro prior to and during (4 °C, 100 min) the binding reaction. Surface Plasmon Resonance—SPR was measured using a BIAcore 3000 instrument (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). The running buffer was 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20. A streptavidin SA chip (BIAcore) was used with 2000 response units of biotinylated pD-NIapro immobilized. The interactions were measured at a flow of 50 μl/min with a 5-min buffer flow, a 5-min injection of NIapro binding DARPins in varying concentrations (45 nm to 100 μm), and a dissociation step of 10 min with buffer flow. The signal of an uncoated reference cell was subtracted from the measurements. The equilibrium data of the interaction were evaluated with a global fit using BIAevaluation 3.0 (BIAcore), Scrubber (BioLogic software, Campbell, Australia), and Clamp (42Myszka D.G. Morton T.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 149-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Prior to Western blot analysis, antigenic samples were normalized to cell density (A600), and proteins were separated by standard 15% SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was done following the protocol of Ref. 43Gallagher S. Winston S.E. Fuller S.A. Hurrell J.G.R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

An Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA) was used for sample transfer using semi-dry electroblotting. Sample detection was achieved using an anti-tetra-His antibody (Qiagen) and an anti-mouse-IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Pierce) or an anti-cI antibody (Invitrogen) and an anti-rabbit-IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma). Blots were developed using nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate as substrates or chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (Millipore). In Vitro Inhibition Study—NIapro activity assays were performed essentially according to published procedures (44Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Methods (San Diego). 1999; 17: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) with small modifications. Briefly, NIapro (3 μm) and selected DARPins or DARPin E2_5 (300 μm) were preincubated in NIapro reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) at room temperature for 5 min prior to starting the measurement. The reaction was started by adding 7.5 μl of 200 μm substrate (Ac-TENLYFQ-amc, where amc is 7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin) to the reaction mixture (Vfinal, 100 μl; cfinal substrate, 15 μm), and initial rates of substrate hydrolysis were immediately recorded by fluorometric measurement of the emission intensity. The assay was carried out at room temperature. The excitation wavelength was 360 nm, and the emission wavelength was 465 nm. Initial velocity data of substrate hydrolysis in the presence of the selected DARPins or E2_5 were normalized to initial velocity data obtained from measurements without DARPins; the value obtained here was arbitrarily set to 100%. All experiments were at least done in triplicate. To obtain NIapro inhibitors from large combinatorial DARPin libraries (15Forrer P. Stumpp M.T. Binz H.K. Plückthun A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 2-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we chose to follow a two-step procedure consisting of an in vitro selection step to obtain pools of DARPins able to bind NIapro, followed by an in vivo screening step to identify those DARPins which not only bind but also inhibit the proteinase activity. This genetic screen is based on the well characterized transcriptional activation properties of fusion proteins consisting of the ω subunit of E. coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) connected covalently to a DNA-binding protein (bacteriophage λ repressor cI (35Dove S.L.

https://openalex.org/W2095570273,"Vav proteins are multidomain signaling molecules critical for mediating signals downstream of several surface receptors, including the antigen receptors of T and B lymphocytes. The catalytic guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity of the Vav Dbl homology (DH) domain is thought to be controlled by an intramolecular autoinhibitory mechanism involving an N-terminal extension and phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the acidic region (AC). Here, we report that the sequences surrounding the Vav1 AC: Tyr142, Tyr160, and Tyr174 are evolutionarily conserved, conform to consensus SH2 domain binding motifs, and bind several proteins implicated in TCR signaling, including Lck, PI3K p85α, and PLCγ1, through direct interactions with their SH2 domains. In addition, the AC tyrosines regulate tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1. We also show that Tyr174 is required for the maintenance of TCR-signaling microclusters and for normal T cell development and activation. In this regard, our data demonstrate that while Vav1 Tyr174 is essential for maintaining the inhibitory constraint of the DH domain in both developing and mature T cells, constitutively activated Vav GEF disrupts TCR-signaling microclusters and leads to defective T cell development and proliferation.

The cells of the αβ T cell lineage progress through a developmental program that links ordered V(D)J gene rearrangement and antigen receptor protein expression to further developmental progression in which CD4–8– cells give rise to CD4+8+ cells that are precursors to CD4+8– or CD4–8+ single positive thymocytes (reviewed in Ref. 1Borowski C.

Subsequently, the recruitment of the adaptors LAT, GADS, and SLP-76, and enzymes such as Tec family kinases, phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1), and Vav family guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) leads to generation of the secondary signaling intermediates, 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), and activation of intracellular Ca2+, Rho GTPases, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) (reviewed in Ref. 2Kane L.P.

Together, these events promote the transcription of genes involved in T cell proliferation, differentiation, and cytoskeletal reorganization. Live cell imaging studies using T cells stimulated on peptide:MHC-containing planar bilayers or on anti-CD3 antibodies immobilized on a planar surface revealed formation of microclusters of signaling proteins, including the TCR, ZAP-70, LAT, and SLP-76, within seconds of contact (3Barda-Saad M.

The Vav family of Rho GEFs consists of three members: Vav1, Vav2, and Vav3, which are expressed in both T and B lymphocytes. Vav proteins contain multiple domains, including a calponin homology (CH) domain, an acidic region (AC), a catalytic Dbl homology domain (DH), a pleckstrin homology domain (PH), a cysteine-rich region (CR), and a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain flanked by two SH3 domains. The importance of Vav1 in lymphocytes was first demonstrated in mice lacking Vav1 (Vav1–/–), which show activation defects in T and B lymphocytes (7Fischer K.D. Zmuldzinas A. Gardner S. Barbacid M.

However, Vav1–/– lymphocytes retain significant functional ability, presumably because of redundancy between Vav family members. Indeed, mice with combined Vav deficiencies show more severe lymphocyte defects (17Fujikawa K. Miletic A.V. Alt F.W. Faccio R. Brown T. Hoog J. Fredericks J. Nishi S. Mildiner S. Moores S.L.

Miletic A.V. Alt F.W. Faccio R. Brown T. Hoog J. Fredericks J. Nishi S. Mildiner S. Moores S.L. Brugge J. Rosen F.S. Swat W. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1595-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Control of Vav GEF activity is complex and involves multiple modes of regulation (reviewed in Ref. 20Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Structural studies suggested that autoinhibitory intramolecular interactions between the CH domain and the CR region and the AC and the DH domain are responsible for maintaining the Vav DH domain in an inactive state (21Aghazadeh B. Lowry W.E. Huang X.Y. Rosen M.K. Cell. 2000; 102: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 22Llorca O. Arias-Palomo E. Zugaza J.L. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1330-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). One mechanism for relieving such an autoinhibitory constraint is via phosphorylation of three conserved AC tyrosines: Tyr142, Tyr160, and Tyr174, which results in unraveling of the autoinhibitory N-terminal extension and its release from the DH domain (21Aghazadeh B. Lowry W.E. Huang X.Y. Rosen M.K. Cell. 2000; 102: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 23Amarasinghe G.K. Rosen M.K. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15257-15268Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Given that tyrosine phosphorylation distinguishes Vav from the plethora of other Rho GEFs (24Bustelo X.R. Ledbetter J.A. Barbacid M. Nature. 1992; 356: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 25Margolis B. Hu P. Katzav S. Li W. Oliver J.M. Ullrich A. Weiss A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1992; 356: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), it is possible that Vav has evolved a complex mechanism for regulation of GEF activity in which tyrosine phosphorylation represents a specific adaptation of Vav proteins to function downstream of ITAM-containing antigen receptors in lymphocytes. It has also been suggested that binding of the Vav PH domain to phosphatidylinositols may contribute to regulation of GEF activity. For example, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) binding to the PH domain of Vav may lead to activation of DH domain activity, whereas phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) binding has been suggested to negatively regulate DH domain activity (26Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). A thermodynamic model has been proposed in which PIP3 binding to the PH domain may relax interactions between the Vav PH domain and the autoinhibited DH domain, thereby allowing access of protein-tyrosine kinases to the AC tyrosines, with the resulting phosphorylation of AC tyrosines and activation of GEF activity (21Aghazadeh B. Lowry W.E. Huang X.Y. Rosen M.K. Cell. 2000; 102: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In this regard, GEF activity is diminished in a mutant of Vav1 in which the PH domain is rendered incapable of interacting with phosphatidylinositols (27Prisco A. Vanes L. Ruf S. Trigueros C. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Immunity. 2005; 23: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, binding of proteins to the N-terminal CH domain of Vav may contribute to activation of the DH domain. For example, interaction of the adaptor protein APS with the CH domain of Vav3 has been implicated in activation of Vav3 (28Yabana N. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7720-7729Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that the tyrosine residues in the Vav1 AC are evolutionarily conserved and conform to consensus SH2 domain binding motifs for several proteins implicated in TCR signaling (including Lck, PI3K p85α, and PLCγ1). Indeed, Tyr142, Tyr160, and Tyr174 can bind these proteins through direct interactions with their SH2 domains. Moreover, the AC tyrosines are essential for total tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1. Our data also indicate that Tyr174 is critical for TCR-induced Vav1 microcluster stability and for normal T cell development and activation, because the Y174F mutation disrupts TCR signaling. Generation of Reconstituted J.Vav Cell Lines, Stimulation, and Immunoblotting—The Vav1-deficient J.Vav cell line was previously described (29Cao Y. Janssen E.M. Duncan A.W. Altman A. Billadeau D.D. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4809-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To generate J.Vav cell lines expressing Vav1WT, Vav1 AC Tyr → Phe mutants, and Vav1Y174F/GEF–, GFP-tagged Vav1 expression constructs were transduced into J.Vav cells via “spinfection” with retroviral particles at room temperature, 2000 rpm for 90 min. GFP+ cells were fluorescent-activated cell-sorted and subcloned. Vav1-GFP constructs were generated by ligation of an XbaI-BamHI Vav1-GFP cDNA fragment into IRES-GFP-RV digested with XhoI-BamHI replacing IRES-GFP. Mutagenesis was performed by PCR (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and confirmed by sequencing. Cells were stimulated with anti-CD3ϵ (clone HIT3a; 1 μg/ml, BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and anti-IgG2a cross-linker (1 μg/ml, Southern Biotechnology Assoc., Birmingham, AL), and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer, Ridgefield, CT), 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4. Western blotting was performed following standard procedures. Primary antibodies were developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-mouse, Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA; anti-rabbit, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Immune complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Peptide Immunoprecipitation Assays—For GST fusion protein immunoprecipitations, peptide-bead complexes were generated by mixing 30 nmol of biotinylated peptide (QCB, Hopkinton, MA) and 20-μl SA-conjugated beads (Sigma) in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 1 h. Complexes were washed four times by adding 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline followed by centrifugation at 4 °C and 13,000 rpm for 1 min. To peptide-bead complex, 500 μl of Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 25 mm HEPES pH 7.5) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer), 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 μg of GST fusion proteins were added followed by rotation at 4 °C for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-GST antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) following standard procedures. For immunoprecipitation from cell lysates, 50 × 106 Jurkat T cells were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer for 20 min on ice. Postnuclear lysates were obtained by centrifugation at 4 °C and 13,000 rpm for 10 min. Clarified lysates were precleared by adding 20 μl of SA-conjugated beads followed by rotation at 4 °C for 1 h. During preclearance, peptide-bead complexes were generated by mixing 30 nmol of biotinylated peptide and 200 μl of beads with 500 μl of PBS with rotation at 4 °C for 1 h. Complexes were washed as described above. Precleared lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C and 13,000 rpm for 1 min and incubated with washed peptide-bead complexes at 4 °C for 1–2 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed and Western blotting performed as above. TIRFM Imaging—Imaging of dynamic Vav1-GFP microcluster assembly and movement was performed using TIRF microscopy as described in Ref. 30Tokunaga M. Kitamura K. Saito K. Iwane A.H. Yanagida T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A beam from a solid state laser (488 nm, 20 milliwatt, SAPPHIRE 488-20-OPS, Coherent) was introduced into an inverted microscope (IX-81, Olympus) for illumination. Images were captured using an EB-CCD camera (C-7190-23, Hamamatsu Photonics) equipped with an image intensifier (C8600-05, Hamamatsu Photonics). Image recording and processing were performed using AQUACOSMOS software (Hamamatsu Photonics), and image analyses were performed using Metamorph Software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Kymographic analysis was performed as in Ref. 6Yokosuka T. Sakata-Sogawa K. Kobayashi W. Hiroshima M. Hashimoto-Tane A. Tokunaga M. Dustin M.L. Saito T. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1253-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar. In brief, an arbitrary “slice” was drawn through a cell and was then applied to all frames of a movie using MetaMorph software. Subsequently, the fluorescence over time of individual Vav1-GFP microclusters contained within the “slice” was visualized as white streaks. For analyses of fluorescence of single microclusters over time, a gate was drawn around individual, randomly chosen microclusters and was applied to all frames of a movie beginning with the first frame in which the microcluster was visible to the last frame of the movie. Fluorescence of a selected microcluster within the gate was reflected in arbitrary units. Mice, Cell Suspensions, Antibodies, and Flow Cytometry—Germline VavNULL mice have been previously described (17Fujikawa K. Miletic A.V. Alt F.W. Faccio R. Brown T. Hoog J. Fredericks J. Nishi S.

Cell suspensions were prepared, counted, and stained with antibodies following standard procedures. The following antibody conjugates were used (BD Biosciences): phycoerythrin (PE), allophyocyanin (APC)-H129.19 (anti-CD4), and cytochrome c (CyC)-53-6.7 (anti-CD8α). All samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with FlowJo software. VavNULL Hematopoietic Stem Cell Complementation (VavNULL-HSCC)—A single dose of 150 mg/kg of 5-flurouracil (10 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, Sigma) was injected into donor mice intraperitoneally. 4–5 days postinjection, donors were sacrificed, and bone marrow (BM) harvested. BM cells were expanded in medium containing 15% fetal calf serum and supplemented with stem cell factor (100 ng/ml, PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), IL-3 (6 ng/ml, PeproTech), and IL-6 (10 ng/ml, PeproTech). After 2 days in culture, the cells were retrovirally transduced via spinfection. Infection efficiency and viability of BM cells were assessed by flow cytometry. RAG2–/–-recipient mice were lethally irradiated with 950 Rad (γ irradiation (Cs137), MDS Nordion, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) and injected with a 250-μl cell suspension (∼.25 × 106 cells), intravenous. Chimera were sacrificed and analyzed 5–7 weeks following reconstitution. T Cell Stimulation and Proliferation Assays—Purified T cells were stimulated with soluble anti-CD3ϵ antibodies (clone 145-2C11, 1 μg/ml, BD Biosciences), as indicated, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was performed as described in Ref. 17Fujikawa K. Miletic A.V. Alt F.W. Faccio R. Brown T. Hoog J. Fredericks J. Nishi S. Mildiner S. Moores S.L. Brugge J. Rosen F.S. Swat W. J. Exp.

Cells were treated with 1 μg/ml anti-CD3 antibodies for 2 min, and the Rac assay was performed using the EZ-Detect Rac1 Activation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Vav1 AC Tyrosines Are Evolutionarily Conserved and Conform to SH2 Domain Binding Motifs—The Vav1 AC of several species was analyzed by sequence alignment (Fig. 1A). This alignment shows that amino acid sequences surrounding AC (Tyr142, Tyr160, and Tyr174; numbering relative to the human sequence) are conserved within several mammalian and non-mammalian species, including frog (Xenopus laevis), zebrafish (Danio rerio), fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), and nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans) (Fig. 1A). Moreover, AC tyrosines are found within consensus binding motifs for the SH2 domains of several proteins implicated in TCR signaling, including the Src family kinase Lck (YXXΦ), the p85α subunit of PI3K (YXXM/Φ), and PLCγ1 (YΦXΦ)(X is any residue, Φ is Val, Ile, or Leu) (Fig. 1A and Refs. 33Songyang Z.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3635-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the AC tyrosines may be involved in Vav interactions with these SH2 domain-containing proteins during TCR signaling. AC Tyrosines Are Critical for Inducible Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Vav1—AC tyrosines have been implicated in regulation of Vav tyrosine phosphorylation and function in T lymphocytes (36Lopez-Lago M. Lee H. Cruz C. Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1678-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 40Billadeau D.D. Mackie S.M. Schoon R.A. Leibson P.J. J.

Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). To determine whether the AC tyrosines can function in T cells as potential SH2 domain docking sites, we first tested whether these residues are phosphorylated during T cell activation using antibodies that specifically recognize phosphorylated-AC Tyr142, Tyr160, or Tyr174, with minimal cross-reactivity. Using Vav1-deficient Jurkat T cells (29Cao Y. Janssen E.M. Duncan A.W. Altman A. Billadeau D.D. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4809-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) in which endogenous Vav1 was replaced by wild-type Vav1-GFP (Vav1WT) or with Vav1 harboring tyrosine-to-phenylalanine (Tyr → Phe) substitutions of the AC tyrosines, we found that consistent with previously published studies (27Prisco A. Vanes L. Ruf S. Trigueros C. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Immunity. 2005; 23: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 36Lopez-Lago M. Lee H. Cruz C. Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1678-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) Vav1 AC tyrosines were rapidly phosphorylated during T cell activation (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1A). To determine if the AC tyrosines are required for inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1 in activated T cells, J.Vav cell lines reconstituted with either Vav1WT or AC tyrosine-mutated Vav1 were stimulated with orthovanadate, and tyrosine phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated Vav1 was examined by immunoblotting with total anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 1C). These experiments reveal that while mutation of any single AC tyrosine has no discernible effect on Vav1 phosphorylation, mutation of Tyr174 in combination with Tyr142 and/or Tyr160, results in severely diminished phosphorylation of Vav1 (Fig. 1C). Strikingly, loss of all three AC tyrosines (Vav1Y3F) leads to a virtually complete disruption of Vav1 total tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1C), even though in addition to the AC tyrosines, there are six tyrosine residues outside of the AC (Tyr267, Tyr482, Tyr603, Tyr604, Tyr826, Tyr841) that conform to consensus tyrosine phosphorylation motifs (35Obenauer J.C. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3635-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). Importantly, we observed similar results when cells were activated by TCR cross-linking with anti-CD3 antibodies (supplemental Fig. S1B), indicating that these results are not an artifact of orthovanadate treatment. Diminished Vav tyrosine phosphorylation is not caused by altered levels of Vav protein expression because the reconstituted J.Vav cell lines express recombinant Vav1-GFP at a level similar to endogenous Vav1 (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Together, these data suggest that the AC tyrosines are critical for TCR-induced phosphorylation of Vav1, suggesting that the AC tyrosines may function as docking sites and/or facilitate access for kinases such as Lck to phosphorylate additional Vav tyrosines. In this context, tyrosine residues outside of the AC may not be accessible to protein-tyrosine kinases as they may not be surface-exposed, or they may be masked by intramolecular interactions. Thus, the AC tyrosines appear to control Vav1 tyrosine phosphorylation and may be required for protein-tyrosine kinase recruitment. Vav1 AC Tyrosines Bind SH2 Domains of TCR-signaling Proteins—To examine AC tyrosine interactions with the SH2 domains of Lck, PI3K p85α, and PLCγ1, we first tested binding of biotinylated peptides derived from the AC of Vav1 containing either phosphorylated or unphosphorylated Tyr142, Tyr160, or Tyr174 (supplemental Table S1) to purified GST-SH2 domain(s) of Lck, PI3K p85α, PLCγ1, or Grb2. As a positive control, we used the previously characterized binding of CD22- or BTLA-derived peptides to the SH2 domain of Grb2 (supplemental Fig. S2A and Refs. 42Yohannan J. Wienands J. Coggeshall K.M. Justement L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18769-18776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar and 43Gavrieli M. Murphy K.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 345: 1440-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These experiments show that, as expected based on the predicted sequence motif binding (Fig. 1A), each of the phosphorylated but not unphosphorylated AC tyrosines can bind to the SH2 domain of Lck, the C-terminal SH2 domain of PLCγ1, or to either of the two SH2 domains of PI3K p85α (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the N-terminal SH2 domain of PLCγ1 did not associate with any of the AC tyrosines nor did the SH2 domain of Grb2 (Fig. 2A), consistent with the preference of the Grb2 SH2 domain for the YXNM motif (Fig. 1 and Ref. 44Schneider H. Cai Y.C. Prasad K.V. Shoelson S.E. Rudd C.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1044-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that phosphorylated Vav1 AC tyrosines can directly bind SH2 domains of several proteins implicated in TCR signaling, consistent with a recent report showing association of the Lck SH2 domain with AC tyrosines (23Amarasinghe G.K. Rosen M.K. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15257-15268Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To determine whether the AC tyrosines could interact with SH2 domain-containing proteins in their native conformation, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using the biotinylated AC tyrosine-containing phosphopeptides and cytoplasmic extracts generated from Jurkat cells. In these experiments, we used the previously characterized interaction between Grb2 and CD22 Tyr828 as a positive control (supplemental Fig. S2B and Ref. 42Yohannan J. Wienands J. Coggeshall K.M. Justement L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18769-18776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These experiments confirmed binding of phosphorylated Tyr142, Tyr160, and Tyr174 AC tyrosine-containing peptides to native Lck protein (Fig. 2B). Moreover, we find that PI3K p85α and PLCγ1 bind specifically to phosphorylated but not unphosphorylated AC tyrosines (Fig. 2B). As expected, Grb2 fails to bind to any of the Vav1 AC tyrosines in these assays (Fig. 2B). Thus, while associations of Vav with Lck, PI3K p85α, and PLCγ1 have been previously shown by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (45Reynolds L.F. de Bettignies C. Norton T. Beeser A. Chernoff J.

Swat, unpublished observations. these data indicate the direct binding of Vav with SH2 domain-containing proteins via phosphorylated AC tyrosines. Vav1 Tyrosine 174 Controls Dynamic Redistribution of Vav1 upon TCR Activation—Recent imaging studies examining activation of T cells on stimulatory planar surfaces have identified microclusters of signaling proteins at the sites of TCR contacts (3Barda-Saad M.

All of these proteins interact with the NPTY motif in the intracellular domain of APP, APLP1, and APLP2 via their phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain (22King G.D. Scott Turner R. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 185: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Protein interacting with APP tail 1 (PAT1) binds to the basolateral sorting sequence (BaSS) of APP and is associated with microtubules. Further, an influence on APP cleavage at the cell surface has been proposed (23Zheng P. Eastman J. Vande Pol S. Pimplikar S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14745-14750Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore, a kinesin light chain (KLC)-like function has been proposed (23Zheng P. Eastman J. Vande Pol S. Pimplikar S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14745-14750Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, the structural and primary sequence homology between PAT1 and KLC is low. Additionally, PAT1 was shown not to interact with kinesin heavy chain (23Zheng P. Eastman J. Vande Pol S. Pimplikar S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14745-14750Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and its association to microtubules is elevated in the presence of ATP (23Zheng P. Eastman J. Vande Pol S. Pimplikar S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14745-14750Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), indicating that PAT1 has no KLC-like function. It has also been reported that PAT1 affects the half-life time of the APP intracellular domain (AICD), suggesting a regulatory function of PAT1 in the putative nuclear signaling of the AICD (24Gao Y. Pimplikar S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14979-14984Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In this study, AICD fragments with a length of 57 (C57) and 59 (C59) amino acids were shown to be affected by PAT1.

Additionally, Ara67, which is 99.6% identical to PAT1, was reported as an androgen receptor-interacting protein, interrupting androgen receptor cytoplasmic-nuclear import and modulating androgen receptor signaling. These studies suggest that PAT1 might be a regulatory factor that controls the subcellular localization of multiple proteins with divergent functions. Here we show that PAT1a, which is 99.0% identical to PAT1, exists in a common complex with APP, APLP1, and APLP2 in vivo and co-localizes with APP/APLPs bearing intracellular vesicles. Moreover, we demonstrate that PAT1a regulates the levels of APP family members at the cell surface. Finally, we provide evidence that PAT1a increases the proteolytic conversion of APP/APLPs and promotes the generation of Aβ, suggesting an important regulatory role of PAT1a in the transport of APP/APLPs with possible implications for Alzheimer disease pathogenesis.

Cell Fractionation and Carbonate Extraction—COS-7 or SH-SY5Y cells were co-transfected with PAT1a-HA and APP, APLP1, or APLP2 cDNAs. 28 h after transfection, cells were lysed in homogenization buffer (HOM) (250 mm sucrose, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by passing 20 times through a 27-gauge needle and centrifuged at 100 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was added to a 9-fold higher volume of carbonate buffer (0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11) and incubated for 15 min on ice. The postnuclear homogenate was then layered on a 1/3 volume of sucrose/carbonate buffer (carbonate buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. Soluble proteins in the supernatant and membrane fractions in the pellet were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. The amounts of PAT1a associated with APP/APLPs in the membrane fraction or present in the fraction containing soluble proteins were quantified using Advanced Image Data Analyzer (AIDA) software, version 3.20.116 (Raytest Isotopen-Messgeräte GmbH). GST Pulldown Analysis—The generation of GST fusion proteins containing the intracellular domain of APP (AICD, aa 649-695), APLP1 (ALICD1, aa 604-650), and APLP2 (ALICD2 aa 717-763) have been described previously (30Lazarov O. Morfini G.A. Lee E.B. Farah M.H. Szodorai A. DeBoer S.R. Koliatsos V.E. Kins S. Lee V.M. Wong P.C. Price D.L. Brady S.T. Sisodia S.S. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2386-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding ALICD1 and ALICD2 lacking the BaSS (aa 604-620 and aa 733-763) (ALICD1ΔBaSS and ALICD2ΔBaSS) were amplified by PCR and cloned by BamHI/NotI in-frame into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The sequence was verified by sequencing of both strands (Agowa). Expression of GST and GST fusion proteins and loading of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) was performed as described previously (31Fuhrmann J.C. Kins S. Rostaing P. El Far O. Kirsch A. Sheng M. Triller A. Betz H. Kneussel M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5393-5402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PAT1a was in vitro-translated in the presence of [35S]methionine (TnT7 quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega)) and incubated with the loaded beads in buffer H (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 50 mm KCl, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2,2mm MgCl2, 0,1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm dithiothreitol) for 90 min. After three times of washing with buffer H, the proteins were eluted and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. Subsequently, gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography (MR films, Amersham Biosciences) overnight. Quantification is based on densitometric measurements using Image Gauge (Fuji Systems). Antibodies—The monoclonal anti-HA and rat anti-c-Myc antibody were purchased from Roche Applied Science and the mouse anti-c-Myc (9E10) antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The β-tubulin antibody (mouse) was from Sigma. Monoclonal antibody against APP (22C11) has been described (32Hilbich C. Monning U. Grund C. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26571-26577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal antibodies against APLP1 (CT-11) and APLP2 (DII-2) were obtained from Calbiochem. For generation of an anti-PAT1a antibody, rabbits were immunized with synthesized peptide corresponding to the C-terminal residues 542-572 of human PAT1a. The resulting antiserum was affinity-purified using the same peptide (SulfoLink kit, Pierce). Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: anti-APP (22C11) 1:10,000 (IB); anti-PAT1a 1:500 (IB), 1:50 (IC); anti-APLP1 (CT11) 1:10,000 (IB); anti-APLP2 (D2-II) 1:10,000 (IB); anti-HA 1:2000 (IB), 1:200 (IC); anti c-Myc 1:200 (IC). For immunoblotting, secondary anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG antibodies (1:10,000) (Promega) and anti-rat IgG antibodies (1:10,000) (DAKO Diagnostic) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were used. For immunofluorescence analysis, secondary anti-mouse, anti-rat, and anti-rabbit antibodies (1:500) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Alexa Fluor series). Immunocytochemical Assays—For immunocytochemical analysis, primary neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. Staining of cells was performed using standard procedures (33Kins S. Kurosinski P. Nitsch R.M. Gotz J. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 833-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 34Kins S. Betz H. Kirsch J. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The fluorescent signals were visualized with an Axiovert 200 m Inverted Microscope (Zeiss) supplied with a CCD Camera (Hamamatsu), and images were acquired and enhanced using the MetaMorph Imaging System (Universal Imaging Co.). Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7, HEK293, and SH-SY5Y cells were cultured under standard conditions. Primary neurons were prepared as described (35Tienari P.J. Ida N. Ikonen E. Simons M. Weidemann A. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Dotti C.G. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4125-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) with the exception that mouse cortical neurons of embryonic day 14 were used. Neurons were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated 15-mm coverslips (Marienfeld) in serum-free neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) with B-27 supplement (Invitrogen), 25 μm glutamate, and 0.5 mm glutamin. Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and collected for analysis 20-72 h after transfection. Silencing of PAT1a Expression—For the down-regulation of PAT1a, a short hairpin (sh) construct (shPAT1a) was cloned into pSilencer1.0-U6 (Ambion) using the sequence previously described by Zhang et al. (36Zhang Y. Yang Y. Yeh S. Chang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1044-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A scrambled RNAi sequence directed against PAT1a (scrPAT1a) was cloned accordingly and served as a control. For cassette cloning of the shPAT1a construct, the following two oligonucleotides were used: forward, 5′-cga agg cag aac agt taa ttt tca aga gaa att aac tgt tct gcc ttc ttt ttt g-3′, and reverse, 5′-aat tca aaa aag aag gca gaa cag tta att tct ctt gaa aat taa ctg ttc tgc ctt cgg gcc-3′. The non-functional scrPAT1a construct was generated by the same strategy, using the following oligonucleotides: forward, 5′-cga agg tag atc agc taa ttt tca aga gaa att aac tgt tct gcc ttc ttt ttt g-3′, and reverse, 5′-aat tca aaa aag aag gca gaa cag tta att tct ctt gaa aat tag ctg atc tac ctt cgg gcc-3′. The identity of the construct was confirmed by sequencing. SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with pSilencer sh-PAT1a and src-PAT1a using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and collected for analysis 48-72 h after transfection. Co-Immunoprecipitation Assay—Adult mouse brains were homogenized in ice-cold co-immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 143 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2,1mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science). Before immunoprecipitation, either anti-PAT1a antibody or preimmune serum as a control was incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads. Alternatively, antibodies were covalently coupled to an agarose gel (ProFundTM co-immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce)). For IPs, brain lysates of young adult mice (C57Bl/6) containing 400 μg of protein were incubated with beads loaded with anti-PAT1/PAT1a antibody or preimmune serum for 4 h at 4°C. After extensive washing with co-immunoprecipitation buffer, immunocaptured protein samples were collected in sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The antigen/antibody-complexes were visualized using ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences). Analyses of APP/APLPs Processing—SH-SY5Y cells were transfected as described previously. For the analysis of secreted sAPP/APLPs and Aβ, fresh growth medium was added to the cells after transfection (2.5 ml for each 6-cm dish and 1 ml for each well of a 6-well plate), conditioned for 30 h, and subsequently assayed for Aβ (ELISA) or analyzed by Western blotting. For the analysis of the full-length APP/APLPs and CTFs, cells were lysed 30 h after transfection for 30 min in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g. The supernatants were denatured in sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 8% Tris-glycine or 15% Tris-Tricine gels and Western blotting. Quantification of Aβ Using Sandwich ELISA Assay—Secreted Aβ levels were measured by a Sandwich ELISA assay (hAmyloid ELISA High Sensitive, The Genetics Company, Zürich, Switzerland) as described (37Duering M. Grimm M.O. Grimm H.S. Schroder J. Hartmann T. Neurobiol. Aging. 2005; 26: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibodies specific to Aβ40 (G2-10) or Aβ42 (G2-13) were used as capture antibodies, and an N-terminal Aβ antibody (W0-2) was used for detection. Aβ levels in the samples were determined by comparison with the signal from media spiked with known quantities of Aβ40 and Aβ42. Surface Biotinylation— 48 h after transfection with control plasmid, PAT1a cDNA, or shPAT1a, SH-SY5Y cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2 mm CaCl2 and 2 mm MgCl2 followed by incubation with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (0.5 mg/ml, Pierce) for1hat4 °C. The reaction was stopped by extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline and quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl, 1% bovine serum albumin in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Cell lysates were prepared and precipitated with streptavidin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The precipitated biotinylated proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis. For detection of PAT1a or APP/APLPs, the indicated antibodies were used and visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence technique (Amersham Biosciences). Polymorphism of the PAT1/APPBP2 Gene—As a prerequisite for our studies of the PAT1 protein, we amplified the coding region of PAT1 cDNA from a human brain cDNA library. Surprisingly, we consistently found seven nucleotide exchanges in eight independent clones, resulting in six amino acid substitutions (F296L, K325R, A337A, S340C, L354V, P369R, N544K) (Fig. 1). Data base analyses of the PAT1 sequence (cDNA, AF017782; aa, AAC83973.1) revealed that besides PAT1, a sequence (APPBP2 cDNA, NM_006380; aa, NP_006371.2) completely identical with the sequence we amplified from the brain cDNA is annotated in the data base. Furthermore, we found that the genomic sequence, which is located on chromosome 17, is also identical to our brain cDNA PCR product and APPBP2 (LocusID: 10513). The Ensembl website gives no indication for a duplication of this gene in the human genome. We analyzed 53 expressed sequence tags covering the region of PAT1 cDNA containing the nucleotide exchanges and found that all tested expressed sequence tag sequences were identical with our brain cDNA PCR products and APPBP2, but none was equal to PAT1. These data indicate that the PAT1 sequence used in previous analyses (23Zheng P. Eastman J. Vande Pol S. Pimplikar S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14745-14750Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 24Gao Y. Pimplikar S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14979-14984Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 36Zhang Y. Yang Y. Yeh S. Chang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1044-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) carries six amino acid exchanges. The PAT1 amino acid sequence is thus 99% identical to APPBP2. We conclude that the PAT1 sequence represents a rare variant of APPBP2 rather than a sequencing error as independently of the PAT1 sequence, six of seven nucleotide exchanges in the PAT1 sequence are annotated as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genomic sequence. In addition, Ara67 has been described to be 99.6% identical with PAT1 (36Zhang Y. Yang Y. Yeh S. Chang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1044-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting that Ara67 is a further variant of PAT1/APPBP2. Thus, PAT1, Ara67, and APPBP2 likely represent different alleles of one single gene, of which APPBP2 is the most common form. For simplification, we propose to rename APPBP2 to PAT1a. Co-localization and Interaction of PAT1a with APP, APLP1, and APLP2 in Neurons—To test whether PAT1a interacts with APP and possibly also with APLP1 and APLP2 in vivo, we performed co-fractionation, co-immunoprecipitation, and co-localization experiments. In a cell fractionation assay, we found that about 50% of PAT1a co-fractionated with membranes containing APP/APLPs. Moreover, PAT1a can be released into the cytosolic fraction by carbonate extraction, showing that it is not a transmembrane protein nor coupled covalently to the membrane (data not shown). Together these data suggest that PAT1a is associated with membrane compartments containing APP, APLP1, and APLP2. To perform co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we generated a polyclonal anti-PAT1a antibody directed against an epitope in the C terminus of human PAT1a (amino acids 542-572). This region contains only one of the amino acid substitutions (N544K) when compared with PAT1/Ara67. Since we have not tested whether the antibody recognizes PAT1 and Ara67, we cannot exclude the possibility of cross-reactivity. However, we show that this anti-PAT1a antibody can be used for Western analyses and immunoprecipitation studies of recombinant HA-tagged PAT1a and endogenous PAT1a (possibly also PAT1 and Ara67) (Fig. 2 and see also Fig. 5). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments with mouse brain extracts using the anti-PAT1a antibody revealed that APP, APLP1, and APLP2 can be co-immunoprecipitated with PAT1a, suggesting that all three APP family members are interacting with PAT1a in vivo (Fig. 2). Co-immunoprecipitations with PAT1a preimmune serum served as control (Fig. 2). Noteworthily, the mature forms of APP, APLP1, and APLP2 were selectively co-immunoprecipitated with PAT1a, indicating specific interaction in post-Golgi compartments.FIGURE 5Cell surface localization of APP depends on PAT1a expression. A, to determine the endogenous PAT1a protein levels, an anti-PAT1a antibody was generated. Depending on the gel system and degree of separation, it recognizes a very close double band (B)at ∼67 kDa in protein extracts (20 μg) of SH-SY5Y cells expressing recombinant PAT1a tagged with a HA tag (PAT1a-HA). The difference in the apparent molecular weight may be due to different post-translational modifications of PAT1a, such as phosphorylation. On the blot in panel A, the proteins were less well separated when compared with the blot in panel B. Thus, PAT1a appears as a single band or as a double band, respectively. Probing of the same extract with a HA antibody revealed an identical signal. After loading of higher amounts of protein extracts (60 μg), the anti-PAT1a antibody also detected endogenous PAT1a in non-transfected cells with the same apparent molecular weight. The overexpression rate of PAT1a was about 3-5-fold higher than endogenous PAT1a protein levels. B, SH-SY5Y cells were treated with transfection reagent only, with shPAT1a, or with a non-functional RNAi construct (scrPAT1a). 48 h after transfection, cell lysates were analyzed on a 8% Tris-glycine gel and subjected to Western analysis using anti-PAT1a and anti-β-tubulin antibodies. C, biotinylation assay 48 h after transfection with PAT1a cDNA, for control pCDNA3.1 or shPAT1a, and for control scrPAT1a. Cells were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with a biotinylation reagent. Cell extracts were prepared, and biotinylated surface proteins were immunoprecipitated. Western analysis was performed with anti-APP, anti-APLP1, or anti-APLP2 antibodies. D, for quantification, densitometric measurements of three independent experiments were performed. The data were normalized to the amount of total APP, APLP1, and APLP2. The mean ± S.E. is indicated. Statistically significant differences in comparison with control cells transfected with pCDNA3.1 (served as control for PAT1a overexpression) or the scrPAT1a construct (served as control for PAT1a knockdown) (Mann-Whitney U-test) with a p value <0.05 are marked by an asterisk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res"
https://openalex.org/W2064818636,"Archaeal RadA or Rad51 recombinases are close homologues of eukaryal Rad51 and DMC1. These and bacterial RecA orthologues play a key role in DNA repair by forming helical nucleoprotein filaments in which a hallmark strand exchange reaction between homologous DNA substrates occurs. Recent studies have discovered the stimulatory role by calcium on human and yeast recombinases. Here we report that the strand exchange activity but not the ATPase activity of an archaeal RadA/Rad51 recombinase from Methanococcus voltae (MvRadA) is also subject to calcium stimulation. Crystallized MvRadA filaments in the presence of CaCl2 resemble that of the recently reported ATPase active form in the presence of an activating dose of KCl. At the ATPase center, one Ca2+ ion takes the place of two K+ ions in the K+-bound form. The terminal phosphate of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue is in a staggered conformation in the Ca2+-bound form. In comparison, an eclipsed conformation was seen in the K+-bound form. Despite the changes in the ATPase center, both forms harbor largely ordered L2 regions in essentially identical conformations. These data suggest a unified stimulation mechanism by potassium and calcium because of the existence of a conserved ATPase center promiscuous in binding cations.

In homologous recombination, a hallmark DNA strand exchange reaction is promoted by RecA-like recombinases between a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and a homologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Such a reaction plays critical role in the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks and restart of stalled replication forks (1Cox M.M.

Cell. 1992; 69: 439-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Large differences in their primary structures exist between bacterial RecAs and nonbacterial orthologues. Their tertiary and quaternary structures, however, are clearly conserved (11VanLoock M.S. Yu X. Yang S. Lai A.L. Low C. Campbell M.J. Egelman E.H.

Such filamentous assemblies are classic allosteric systems equipped with at least two functional sites, one located at the subunit interface for binding and hydrolyzing ATP and the other located near the filament axis for binding DNA and promoting strand exchange. In vitro studies have clearly shown that optimal reaction conditions differ for the well characterized Escherichia coli RecA (EcRecA) and members of the archaeal/eukaryal group (14Rice K.P. Eggler A.L. Sung P. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38570-38581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Liu Y. Stasiak A.Z. Masson J.Y. McIlwraith M.J. Stasiak A.

Nature. 2004; 429: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). EcRecA favors low salt conditions with little or no monovalent cation. Human and yeast Rad51 and DMC1, on the other hand, favor the presence of a salt, typically KCl or (NH4)2SO4. Fishel and coworkers further found that human Rad51 is stimulated by K+ or bigger monovalent cations (17Shim K.S. Schmutte C. Yoder K. Fishel R. DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 718-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Using MvRadA 2The abbreviations used are: MvRadA, RadA recombinase from M. voltae; EcRecA, RecA recombinase from E. coli; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA. as a prototype, we have structurally rationalized that monovalent cations stimulate RadA/Rad51/DMC1 by bridging and stabilizing a critical L2 region with the ATP cofactor (18Wu Y.

Biol. 2006; 360: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the reported MvRadA structures could not explain the recently discovered stimulatory role by divalent Ca2+ ions on human Rad51 (20Bugreev D.V. Mazin A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9988-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and DMC1 (21Bugreev D.V. Golub E.I. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. Mazin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26886-26895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Though initially suspected of being relevant only to higher eukaryotes in sensing the second messenger Ca2+, similar effects have later been found for yeast DMC1 (22Lee M.H. Chang Y.C. Hong E.L. Grubb J. Chang C.S. Bishop D.K. Wang T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 49: 40980-40984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To test whether a similar effect by Ca2+ exists in archaeal orthologues, we carried out assays on MvRadA in the presence of Ca2+. The strand exchange activity but not the ATPase activity of MvRadA is stimulated by Ca2+, suggesting that this archaeal orthologue also possesses a structural element for sensing Ca2+. We further determined the crystal structure of MvRadA in the presence of Ca2+. A largely ordered L2 is anchored by Ca2+ with the ATP cofactor in an essentially identical conformation to that previously elucidated in the K+-activated forms of MvRadA. Analysis of sequence and structure suggests that archaeal/eukaryal recombinases may share a negatively charged cavity lined by ATP, the catalytic Glu, an Asp in the ATP cap, and the C terminus of a short helix in the L2 region. We interpret these results as suggesting a unified stimulation mechanism by various cations because of the existence of such a conserved and promiscuous cation-binding pocket in the ATPase center of closely related RadA/Rad51/DMC1 recombinases. Cloning, Protein Preparation, and Crystallization—RadA from Methanococcus voltae was subcloned into pET28a (Novagen). The recombinant proteins were overexpressed in BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL cells (Stratagene) and purified as reported (13Wu Y. He Y. Moya I.A. Qian X. Luo Y. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 423-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 19Qian X. He Y. Wu Y. Luo Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In brief, the purification procedure involved steps of polymin P (Sigma) precipitation, high salt extraction, and three chromatography steps using heparin (Amersham Biosciences), hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad), and DE52 (Whatman) columns. The RadA protein pooled between 0.3 and 0.4 m NaCl from the DE52 column was concentrated to ∼30 mg/ml by ultra-filtration. Strand Exchange Assay Using Virion DNA—Circular single-stranded ϕX174 virion DNA (5386 nucleotides) and its homologous double-stranded ϕX174 replication form I DNA (5386 base pairs) were purchased from New England Biolabs. The double-stranded replication form I DNA was linearized by PstI (VWR) digestion before being used as the dsDNA substrate. The reaction solutions were composed of 50 mm Tris-Hepes buffer at pH 7.4, specified amount of CaCl2 or MgCl2, 5 mm ATP or AMP-PNP. The reaction solution with ATP was supplemented with an ATP regenerating system composed of 4 mm creatine phosphate and 0.01 unit/μl creatine kinase (VWR). The circular single-stranded ϕX174 virion DNA (5 ng/μl or 15 μm in nucleotides) and MvRadA (5 μm) were first incubated in the reaction buffer at 37 °C for 3 min. Then single-stranded DNA-binding protein from E. coli (VWR) was added to a concentration of 1 μm. After a second incubation at 37 °C for 3 min, the PstI-linearized dsDNA was added to a concentration of 10 ng/μl (15 μm in base pairs). After a third incubation at 37 °C for 90 min, SDS (a final concentration of 1%) and proteinase K (a final concentration of 1 μg/μl, VWR) were added to the reaction solution. A further incubation for 10 min was required to fully degrade MvRadA. A 10-μl sample was mixed with 5 μl of loading buffer composed of 30% glycerol and 0.1% bromphenol blue and loaded onto a 0.6% agarose horizontal gel. The DNA gel electrophoresis was developed for 4 h in a constant electric field of 4 V/cm. The ethidium bromide-stained gel was recorded with a Kodak Gel Logic 200 system. Strand exchange yields were quantified using the Kodak MI software. Strand exchange yields were derived by dividing the integrated intensity of the product band by the average intensity of the dsDNA bands in inactive lanes. Strand Exchange Assay Using Synthetic Oligonucleotides—A 63-nucleotide oligonucleotide and a homologous 36-bp double-stranded DNA were used as the strand exchange substrates as described previously (19Qian X. He Y. Wu Y. Luo Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The solution for strand exchange reaction was composed of 5 mm ATP or an analogous nucleotide, 6 mm MgCl2 or CaCl2, 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mm Hepes-Tris buffer at pH 7.4, 21 μm MvRadA, and 1 μm oligonucleotides. The 63-nucleotide ssDNA substrate was pre-incubated at 37 °C with MvRadA for 1 min before adding the 36-bp dsDNA substrate. The reaction was stopped at 30 min by adding EDTA to a concentration of 20 mm and trypsin to a concentration of 1 μg/μl. After 10 min of trypsin digestion at 37 °C, a 10-μl sample was mixed with 5 μl of loading buffer composed of 30% glycerol and 0.1% bromphenol blue and then loaded onto a 17% acrylamide gel. The SDS-PAGE was developed, stained with ethidium bromide, and digitized with the Kodak Gel Logic 200 system. Crystallization and Structure Determination—The concentrated MvRadA protein (∼30 mg/ml) was crystallized using the hanging drop crystallization method at a room temperature of 21 °C. The optimal well solution for crystallization contained 2 mm AMP-PNP, 0.005 m MgCl2, 0.025 m CaCl2, 0.5 m NaCl, 6% polyethylene glycol 3350, and 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.2-7.8. Crystals grew to a typical size of 0.15 mm wide and 0.4 mm long in 4 days. AMP-PNP and polyethylene glycol 3350 were purchased from Sigma. The other chemicals used in crystallization were from VWR. Crystals were gradually transferred to soaking solution composed of the crystallization reservoir solution supplemented with 10, 15, 20, and 25% glycerol, soaked for ∼5 min, then flash-cooled to 100 K in a nitrogen stream generated by an Oxford Cryosystems device. The 0.4° oscillation images were acquired and processed using a Bruker Proteum R system as described (13Wu Y. He Y. Moya I.A. Qian X. Luo Y. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 423-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Another crystal was cooled by dipping into liquid nitrogen and data collected at the 08ID-1 beamline at the Canadian Light Source. A total of 360 consecutive images of 1° oscillation and 1 s exposure were acquired. This synchrotron data set was processed using XDS (23Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3243) Google Scholar). The previously solved MvRadA model (Protein Data Bank code 1XU4) was used as the starting model for rigid body refinement. The model was iteratively rebuilt using XtalView (24McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) and refined using crystallography NMR software (25Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

Using the data collected with the in-house Bruker system, a 2.8 Å-resolution anomalous difference map was generated using model-derived phases retarded by 90°. An ordered calcium site near the ATP analogue was located at a major peak (∼7 σ) in the anomalous difference map, where most minor peaks (3-4 σ) corresponded to sulfur atoms in Met and Cys residues. Using the synchrotron data set, the calcium site corresponded to a higher density peak (∼18 σ) in the anomalous difference map. Some sulfur and phosphorous atoms also corresponded to higher anomalous density peaks up to 6 σ. Statistics of the diffraction data, refinement, and geometry are given in Table 1. The molecular figures were generated using Molscript (26Kraulis P. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and rendered using Raster3D (27Bacon D.J. Anderson W.F. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 1988; 6: 219-220Crossref Google Scholar). The coordinates and structure factors of the synchrotron data set have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code 2I1Q).TABLE 1X-ray crystallographic data and structure refinement statisticsX-ray crystallographic dataX-ray sourceIn-houseSynchrotronWavelength (Å)1.54181.3303Space groupP61P61Unit cell dimensions (Å)a = b = 83.5, c = 104.2a = b = 84.2, c = 104.7Resolution rangeaValues in parentheses refer to values in the highest resolution shell (Å)40–2.10 (2.20–2.10)40–1.9 (2.0–1.9)Observed reflections81,88773,4621Unique reflection21,20333,129Completeness (%)87.1 (40.5)99.9 (99.1)RsymbRsym = Σ|Ih – 〈I 〉h|/ΣIh, where 〈I 〉h is average over symmetry equivalents, h is reflection index0.060 (0.222)0.058 (0.346)I/σ10.6 (2.1)43.2 (10.4)Anomalous (I/σ)2.6 (1.9)0.9 (0.6)Crystal structure refinementReflection with F > 019457/81.0%33129/99.9%R-factor/R-freecR-factor = Σ|Fobs – Fcalc|/ΣFobs.

Biol. 2006; 360: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Two K+ ions stabilize an ATPase and strand exchange-active conformation by filling in a negatively charged cavity at the ATPase center. However, potassium and other monovalent ions are not the only recombinase-activating cations known to date. To find out whether a similar effect by divalent Ca2+ ions exists in archaeal orthologues as reported for human and yeast Rad51 and DMC1 recombinases (20Bugreev D.V. Mazin A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9988-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 21Bugreev D.V. Golub E.I. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. Mazin A.V. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 49: 40980-40984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we carried out ATPase and strand exchange assays on MvRadA in the presence of divalent cations Ca2+ and Mg2+. Despite screening a number of monovalent cations (18Wu Y. Qian X. He Y. Moya I.A. Luo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 722-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and divalent cations (Mg2+ and Ca2+, data not shown), K+ remains the only cation that stimulates the ATPase activity of MvRadA. In comparison, other tested monovalent and divalent cations registered less than 5% of the maximal ATPase activity recorded in the presence of 100 mm KCl. The stimulation on the strand exchange activity of MvRadA, on the other hand, appeared to require the presence of ions such as but not limited to K+. Similar to its roles on human and yeast homologues, Ca2+ activates the strand exchange activity of MvRadA (Fig. 1) without drastically boosting ATPase activity (data not shown). In the presence of 5 mm ATP, more of 2 mm CaCl2 was needed for yielding visible quantities of the plasmidsize strand-exchange product (Fig. 1A). A maximal yield of ∼8% was observed in the presence of 4 mm CaCl2. It is worth noting that the assay was performed in the absence of potassium, the only previously known stimulant for this protein. We also resorted to shorter DNA substrates, the strand exchange between which does not require the presence of single-stranded DNA-binding protein. Stimulation by Ca2+ was observed in the presence of ATP or AMP-PNP (Fig. 1B). Therefore, it appears that stimulation by Ca2+ on DNA strand exchange is a universal phenomenon shared by RadA/Rad51/DMC1 recombinases. Structural Basis for Calcium Stimulation—To pursue a structural elucidation of the mechanism of calcium stimulation, we carried out strand exchange assay in the presence of AMP-PNP, the only ATP analogue amenable to MvRadA crystallization. In the presence of 5 mm AMP-PNP and 2-6 mm CaCl2, MvRadA did promote strand exchange between viron DNAs (Fig. 1A). The yields were similar to those in the presence of ATP. We then attempted crystallizing MvRadA in the presence of AMP-PNP and CaCl2. MgCl2 was found to be an essential ingredient in the production of diffractive crystals, though crystallization could be achieved in its absence. The strand exchange activity in the presence of AMP-PNP and mixtures of MgCl2 and CaCl2 was confirmed (Fig. 1A) before proceeding to final optimization of crystallization conditions and structural determination. The calcium-bound structure was first refined to a resolution of 2.1 Å using an in-house data set (Table 1). Because calcium is the major anomalous scattering element in the crystal, the resulting anomalous difference map was used to locate a Ca2+ species near the γ-phosphate of AMP-PNP (Fig. 2A). A synchrotron data set of 1.9 Å-resolution was acquired later at the new 08ID-1 beamline at the Canadian Light Source, which provided improved clarity in electron density maps (Fig. 2B) and agreed with the in-house data-based assignment of a Ca2+ species. All crystals in this and previous studies of MvRadA belong to space group P61 with similar helical pitches and essentially identical packing schemes. The filament pitch coinciding with the crystallographic c axis is 104.2 Å, 1-2 Å shorter than previously reported forms using the same cooling and in-house diffracting procedures. The Ca2+-bound structure is unexpectedly and strikingly similar to the previously determined K+-bound form of MvRadA (Fig. 3B) (18Wu Y. Qian X. He Y. Moya I.A. Luo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 722-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 28Qian X. Wu Y. He Y. Luo Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 13753-13761Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-bound form also has an octahedral Mg2+ ion in a position seen in many P-loop-containing GTPases and ATPases. The lack of anomalous signal and the distances (1.9-2.2 Å) from this species to its six-ligand oxygen atoms enabled the Mg2+ assignment. As seen in other crystal forms, AMP-PNP, the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue is buried between MvRadA promoters (Fig. 3). One subunit (Fig. 3, yellow subunit) contacts the ATP analogue and the octahedral Mg2+ largely through its conserved P-loop (residues Gly-105 to Thr-112) (29Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar) and the base-stacking Arg-158. The adjacent subunit (Fig. 3, gray subunit) contributes the ATP cap (residues Asp-302 to Asp-308) and the C-terminal portion of the L2 region in trans. The putative ssDNA-binding L2 region (residues Asn-256 to Arg-285) has an 8-residue helix (residues Gly-275 to Ala-282) analogous to helix G of EcRecA (30Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The side chain of His-280 therein forms a direct hydrogen bond with the γ-phosphate of the ATP analogue. One Ca2+ ion (Fig. 3A, large salmon spheres) located by anomalous signals forms a bridge between the γ-phosphate and three backbone carbonyl moieties at the C terminus of the 8-residue helix. Unlike the Mg2+, seven oxygen ligands of this Ca2+ form a pentagonal bipyramid. The carbonyl O atom of Ala-282 and one Oγ atom of the ATP analogue constitute the poles. Three water ligands and two carbonyl O atoms in Gly-279 and His-280 constitute the equatorial pentagon. The Ca2+ ion makes indirect contact with Glu-151 or Asp-302 through two of its three water ligands. A candidate for the hydrolyzing water (Fig. 3A, large green spheres) is hydrogen-bonded with the side chains of Glu-151 and Gln-257 from the subunit contributing the P-loop. The analogous residues of EcRecA (Glu-96 and Gln-194) have been proposed as the catalytic residues based on the EcRecA crystal structure (30Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) and analogy to GTPases (31Kelley J.A. Knight K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25778-25782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), respectively. As expected for a P-loop-containing ATPase, the γ-phosphate contacts the ϵ-amino group of Lys-111 and the Mg2+ ion. With the added electron-withdrawing effects by His-280 and the Ca2+ ion, the γ-phosphate is likely further polarized for the nucleophilic attack by the hydrolysis water positioned and activated by Glu-151 and Gln-257. However, the terminal phosphate is in a staggered conformation (Fig. 3A), which may lack the maximal phosphate-phosphate repulsion in the eclipsed conformation seen in the K+-bound ATPase active form (Protein Data Bank code 2FPM, Fig. 3B) (28Qian X. Wu Y. He Y. Luo Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 13753-13761Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This may partially explain why calcium does not stimulate optimal ATPase activity. The L2 region, which is more important for strand exchange activity, is in an essentially identical conformation as seen in the K+-bound form. Both forms lacked interpretable electron densities for a 7-residue segment from Pro-262 to Met-268. In comparison, ∼19 residues (residues 260-278) in the L2 region are disordered in the recurrent inactive form of MvRadA crystallized in the presence of ADP instead of AMP-PNP or in the absence of an adequate amount of a stimulatory cation. Because both potassium and calcium ions are elucidated to stabilize a largely ordered L2 conformation, which is correlated with the stimulating roles of the ions in DNA strand exchange, we view these findings as further supporting evidence for the notion that a properly dispositioned L2 region is critical for promoting DNA strand exchange as reviewed by Bell (32Bell C.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3ATPase center of MvRadA in stereo. The view is rotated from that in Fig. 2 by ∼90°. Two MvRadA subunits are in yellow and gray, respectively. Ca2+ and K+ ions are in salmon and red, respectively. Mg2+ ions and water molecules are blue and green, respectively. The putative hydrolysis water is highlighted in a larger sphere. A, Ca2+-bound form. B, previously reported K+-bound form (Protein Data Bank entry code 2FPM). The L2 regions are in essentially identical conformations in both forms. Ca2+ and K+ are bound in a conserved cavity lined by the tip of the nucleotide cofactor, the catalytic Glu-151, Asp-302 in the ATP cap, and the C terminus of a short helix in the L2 region. The terminal phosphate is in a staggered conformation in the Ca2+-bound form but in an eclipsed conformation in the K+-bound form.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mg2+ Stimulates Strand Exchange Activity of MvRadA—The structural comparison between K+- and Ca2+-bound structures implies a promiscuous cavity capable of incorporating varied numbers and sizes of cations. Indeed, the location of the Ca2+ ion in the new crystal form lies between the two K+ ions in the previously reported ATPase-active form (Fig. 3). We further tested the possibility that this cavity could house the physiologically abundant magnesium ion. Although Mg2+ appeared a stronger activator than Ca2+, more than 5 mm MgCl2 was required to promote DNA strand exchange to 50% of the maximal yield (Fig. 4A). In comparison, a lower (2 mm) CaCl2 concentration was required to exhibit ∼50% of its maximal stimulatory effect (Fig. 1A). It is generally believed that the P-loop-containing ATPases bind M(II)-ATP chelates. We argue that the binding of K+,Ca2+, or other ions in the structurally characterized cavity occurs after the incorporation of M(II)-ATP. As such, the saturation of the ion-binding cavity would be affected by the concentration of free ions. In the presence of 5 mm ATP, an efficient Mg2+ and Ca2+ chelator, free cation concentrations were estimated by using the MAXCHELATOR software (33Patton C. Thompson S. Epel D. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Approximately 0.5-1.2 mm free Mg2+ is present when a total of 5-6 mm MgCl2 is added to half-activate MvRadA. A much lower free Ca2+ concentration of ∼0.08 mm corresponds to the half-activating dose of 2 mm CaCl2. We speculate that one or two Mg2+ ions could be bound in the MvRadA cavity but with lower affinity than Ca2+. In the presence of AMP-PNP, Mg2+ did not appear to stimulate MvRadA in promoting strand exchange between viron DNA (Fig. 4A) or oligonucleotides (Fig. 4B). As such, it is not surprising that previously reported MvRadA structures crystallized in the presence of Mg2+ did not reveal a second magnesium ion in contact with the γ-phosphate of AMP-PNP. The archaeal RadA protein from M. voltae is a bona fide RecA orthologue that promotes the hallmark strand exchange reaction between homologous DNAs. Consistent with its sequence similarity with eukaryal Rad51/DMC1 recombinases, the archaeal RadA from M. voltae is similarly activated by K+ and Ca2+ ions. Therefore, MvRadA can serve as a structural model for rationalizing the activation mechanism of its human homologues. An active recombinase DNA filament is in a strand exchange-competent state, which harbors an extended and under-wound form of DNA as compared with B-DNA (34Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 539-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The assembly of an active filament also requires the binding of Mg2+ and ATP cofactors at the ATPase center of each subunit, which dooms the complex because of the intrinsic ATPase activity unless ATP hydrolysis is blocked or ATP is replenished by ADP/ATP exchange. Based on the crystal structure of E. coli RecA, two axially located loops L1 and L2 have been proposed as the structural elements for binding DNA (30Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). This structure-based hypothesis has been supported by numerous experiments as reviewed (35McGrew D.A. Knight K.L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 38: 385-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the crystal structures of MvRadA, two loops equivalent to L1 and L2 of EcRecA are closer to the filament axis than seen in the EcRecA structure (13Wu Y. He Y. Moya I.A. Qian X. Luo Y. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 423-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Their axial location would be suitable for binding DNA. Besides, RecA-like recombinases are classical allosteric proteins with a signature interplay between its ATPase center and DNA-binding loops. The stimulatory roles of potassium ions on the ATPase and strand exchange activities of MvRadA (18Wu Y. Qian X. He Y. Moya I.A. Luo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 722-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 19Qian X. He Y. Wu Y. Luo Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) led to the first revelation that concomitant conformational changes in its ATPase center and L2 region (which encompass the L2 loop and its elbows). Structures determined in the presence of strand exchange stimulant ions K+ and Ca2+ harbor largely ordered L2 regions in a recurrent conformation as compared with a more disordered one in structures determined in the absence of adequate stimulating ions or in the presence of ADP (28Qian X. Wu Y. He Y. Luo Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 13753-13761Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These findings are not only consistent with the notion that L2 is critical for promoting DNA strand exchange but also provide a satisfying explanation to why ATP and Mg2+ cofactors and ionic stimulants are needed (Fig. 5). A cation-bridged interaction between the ATP cofactor and the C-terminal short helix in the L2 region appears essential in the proper disposition of L2 as well as in further polarizing ATP for hydrolysis. The negatively charged nature of the cation-binding pocket is further strengthened by two conserved carboxylates, one from the invariable Asp in the ATP cap and the other from the catalytic Glu. As the short helix points its C terminus toward this pocket, electrostatic repulsion would destabilize such a L2 disposition without cationic bridging. Therefore, the K+- and Ca2+-bound structures offer a plausible explanation for the cationic activation on archaeal and eukaryal recombinases. Yet it astonishes that MvRadA and perhaps its eukaryal homologues as well is capable of incorporating both monovalent and divalent cations of various radii. The ∼1 Å-shortening of each helical 6-subunit rise of the Ca2+-bound MvRadA filament compared with the K+-bound one amounts to a ∼0.2 Å smaller gap between adjacent subunits where the stimulating ions are bound. This would partially offset the ∼ 0.3 Å smaller ionic radius of Ca2+. The still wider-than-ideal gap is compensated by seven, one more than usual, oxygen ligands of the Ca2+ to further satisfy the valence rule (36Nayal M. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The ATP in contact with the ions also switches from the eclipsed conformation in the K+-bound form to the staggered conformation in the Ca2+-bound form. Though direct Ca2+-carboxylate contacts with both Glu-151 and Asp-302 are infeasible, the stabilizing effects by these two conserved residues are retained in forming hydrogen bonds with the hydration shell of Ca2+. This conformational variability of the ATPase center allows for promiscuous binding of cations while stabilizing a recurrent L2 disposition for promoting proper interactions with DNA substrates and hence strand-exchange. In the absence of a stimulatory cation or in the aftermath of ATP hydrolysis, L2 becomes disordered (28Qian X. Wu Y. He Y. Luo Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 13753-13761Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This scenario of order-disorder transition appears recurrent in similar ATPase complexes such as the motor in the bacterial Sec protein translocation machinery (37Keramisanou D. Biris N. Gelis I. Sianidis G. Karamanou S. Economou A. Kalodimos C.G. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 594-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Also because of the subtle yet noticeable changes in the ATPase center, the similarly polarized ATP, either by one Ca2+ or two K+, may sense enough disparity in its surroundings for efficient hydrolysis. Though unexpected, crystal structures of MvRadA appear to suggest a unified activation mechanism by monovalent and divalent cations on this archaeal recombinase. In light of the findings that such archaeal and eukaryal recombinases share a high degree of similarity in ionic activation consistent with their resemblance in amino acid sequence, it would not be surprising that they share this conserved structural element for cation sensing. In particular, as pointed out by Bugreev and Mazin (20Bugreev D.V. Mazin A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9988-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), sensing Ca2+ as a second messenger could play a regulatory role on recombinase activity in higher eukaryotes. Though we speculate that the primary Ca2+, which anchors the L2 elbow, is likely to play a major role in triggering the large scale conformational change, it is prudent to notice two additional calcium ions located by anomalous signals. Neither is in contact with the flexible L2 loop. The second Ca2+ is partially enclosed by the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyls of the bound AMP-PNP, the carboxylate of Asp-308, and the carbonyl of Tyr-301. In a previously reported inactive filament in which L2 is largely disordered, this cavity is occupied (Protein Data Bank entry code 2FPL) by a potassium ion. Intake of a cation at this site does not appear to be correlated with the ordering in the L2 region. Nevertheless, cations such as potassium and calcium may play a role in the recognition of the ribose moiety of the nucleotide cofactor. The third Ca2+ replaces an Mg2+/Mn2+ seen in all previously reported MvRadA structures. This cation species is liganded by Asp-246. We made a D246A mutant MvRadA, 3X. Qian, Y. He, and Y. Luo, unpublished data. the crystal structure of which no longer harbors a cation near Ala-246. However, this D246A protein was observed to be proficient in promoting DNA strand exchange. Therefore, it is unlikely calcium binding near Asp-246 would play a major role in activating MvRadA by triggering the observed conformational change in the L2 region. In light of recent development in eukaryal Rad51/DMC1 proteins, activation of DNA strand exchange appears correlated with K+ or Ca2+-triggered transition from inactive ringshaped oligomers to active nucleoprotein filaments (16Sehorn M.G. Sigurdsson S. Bussen W. Unger V.M. Sung P. Nature. 2004; 429: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 22Lee M.H. Chang Y.C. Hong E.L. Grubb J. Chang C.S. Bishop D.K. Wang T.F. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3292-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). On the other hand, two recurrent conformations have been observed in the crystal structures of MvRadA. In the presence of ADP or in the absence of adequate cationic activator, the L2 region is disordered, suggesting that this form resembles an inactive post-hydrolysis intermediate (28Qian X. Wu Y. He Y. Luo Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 13753-13761Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The disordered feature of this form implies that its L2 region is not fully engaged in interacting with DNA. As such, direct conversion of ringshaped oligomers into inactive nucleoprotein filaments is unlikely. The crystallized filaments in the presence of canonical magnesium and nucleotide co-factors as well as calcium or high concentration of potassium harbor a largely ordered L2 region and may resemble the active filament previously seen by imaging techniques. The ordered L2 and L1 regions form a continuous axial groove (Fig. 5) in this seemingly active form implies that their stabilizing interactions with DNA are optimal for the ring-to-filament transition to occur. Archaeal RadA and eukaryal Rad51/DMC1 proteins share a conserved anionic cage highlighted by the invariable Glu-151/Asp-302. By filling this cavity, counter ions such as K+ or Ca2+ would stabilize this conformation and hence triggering increased affinity for DNA and assembly of active nucleoprotein filaments. We thank Drs.

Characterization of cellular mechanisms that regulate SFK activity will provide insights into the pathogenesis of diseases associated with increased SFK activity. Keratin 14-Fyn (K14) transgenic mice were derived to characterize the effect of Fyn on epidermal growth and differentiation in vivo. The epidermis of K14-Fyn mice is thickened, manifests prominent scale, and exhibits features consistent with hyperproliferation. Increased epidermal Fyn levels correlate with activation of p44/42 MAP kinases, STAT-3, and PDK-1, key signaling molecules that promote epithelial cell growth. The Src-activating and signaling molecule (Srcasm) is a substrate of SFKs that becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated downstream of the EGF receptor. In vitro, increased Srcasm levels promote activation of endogenous Fyn and keratinocyte differentiation. To study the in vivo effect of Srcasm upon Fyn, double transgenic lines were derived. K14-Fyn/Srcasm transgenic mice did not manifest the hyperproliferative phenotype. In contrast, K14-Fyn/Srcasm-P transgenic mice, which express a nonphosphorylatable Srcasm mutant, maintained the hyperproliferative phenotype. Resolution of the hyperproliferative phenotype correlated with reduced Fyn levels in vivo in three experimental systems: transgenic mice, primary keratinocytes, and cell lines. Biochemical studies revealed that Srcasm-dependent Fyn down-regulation requires Fyn kinase activity, phosphorylation of Srcasm, and the Srcasm GAT domain. Therefore, Srcasm is a novel regulator of Fyn promoting kinase down-regulation in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Srcasm may act as a molecular “rheostat” for activated SFKs, and cellular levels of Srcasm may be important for regulating epithelial hyperproliferation associated with increased SFK activity.

Increased SFK activity in tumors could result from activating mutations and/or impairment of down-regulatory mechanisms. However, activating mutations of SFKs are rare in these carcinomas, raising the hypothesis that impaired down-regulation of activated SFKs could account for increased tumoral SFK activity (6Daigo Y. Furukawa Y. Kawasoe T. Ishiguro H. Fujita M. Sugai S. Nakamori S. Liefers G.J. Tollenaar R.A. van de Velde C.J. Nakamura Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4222-4224PubMed Google Scholar, 7Irby R.B. Mao W.

Therefore, characterization of negative regulatory mechanisms that target activated SFKs may provide insights into carcinogenesis associated with increased SFK activity.In skin, neoplasia is associated with increased cellular proliferation, epidermal hyperplasia, and increased EGF receptor activity (8Merlino G.T.

To evaluate the in vivo effects of increased Fyn expression, K14-Fyn transgenic mice were derived and characterized. K14-Fyn mice demonstrate a thickened, hyperplastic, and scaly epidermis dependent on increased Fyn expression.

In addition, keratin 6 expression was up-regulated consistent with a hyperproliferative phenotype.Srcasm, the Src-activating and signaling molecule, is an SFK substrate that is tyrosine-phosphorylated secondary to EGF and transforming growth factor-α stimulation of primary human keratinocytes. Srcasm modulates p44/42 MAP kinase signaling in an EGF-dependent manner (14Li W. Marshall C. Mei L. Dzubow L. Schmults C. Dans M. Seykora J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6036-6046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Seykora J.T.M.L. Dotto G.P. Stein P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2812-2822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Increased Srcasm levels activate endogenous Fyn, promote differentiation, and decrease the S-phase fraction of primary human keratinocytes, even after EGF stimulation. Srcasm levels are decreased in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and associated precursor lesions (14Li W. Marshall C. Mei L. Dzubow L. Schmults C. Dans M. Seykora J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6036-6046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Srcasm is an important regulator of SFKs in keratinocytes that promotes keratinocyte differentiation.The in vivo relationship between Fyn and Srcasm was evaluated by generating double transgenic lines co-expressing Fyn with native Srcasm or Srcasm-P, a mutant lacking Fyn phosphorylation sites. K14-Fyn/Srcasm mice did not exhibit a hyperproliferative phenotype, whereas the K14-Fyn/Srcasm-P mice did. Increased Srcasm, but not Srcasm-P, expression in K14-Fyn/Srcasm mice correlated with decreased Fyn levels. Biochemical studies delineate a mechanism of Srcasm-dependent Fyn down-regulation that requires Fyn kinase activity, the Fyn phosphorylation sites of Srcasm, and the Srcasm GAT (GGA and Tom-1) domain. Srcasm efficiently down-regulates constitutively activated Fyn mutants but not kinase-inactive mutants. High levels of Srcasm also interfere with the down-regulatory process, suggesting a biphasic relationship between activated SFKs and Srcasm. Therefore, Srcasm is a novel molecular “rheostat” for activated SFKs that limits cellular proliferation and promotes differentiation.MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression Vector Construction and Generation of Transgenic Mice—Murine HA-Srcasm and Fyn cDNAs were cloned into a human keratin 14 expression vector (23Seykora J.T.M.L.

The Srcasm-P mutant contained Tyr to Phe mutations at tyrosines 392, 440, 441, and 457. All K14 transgene cassettes were excised from the targeting vector and purified via Tris acetate-EDTA-agarose electrophoresis. C57BL/6 × CBA-fertilized oocytes were microinjected with the K14 transgene cassettes using standard protocols of the University of Pennsylvania Transgenic Core Facility.Characterization of Transgenic Mice—Tail genomic DNA was isolated, and a genomic PCR was performed using the following primers: coding primer (K14 promoter), 5′-ATCTTGAGAACTTCAGGG-3′; noncoding primer (Srcasm), 5′-GGTGACCCACAGAGGTAG-3′. This strategy produced a 900-bp Srcasm transgene product. To detect Fyn transgenes, the primer pair of K14 promoter coding (5′-AAC GTG CTG GTT ATT GTG CTG-3′) and Fyn noncoding (5′-TTC CGT CCG TGC TTC ATA GT-3′ was used to amplify a 400-bp product. Transgenic founders and littermate controls were crossed with C57BL/6 mice to generate lines. F1 transgenic progeny were crossed with C57BL/6 mice to maintain lines. The skin of mice was examined at least biweekly after birth; mice exhibiting severe runting were monitored daily. The phenotypes described were maintained through at least 7 generations. In the K14-Fyn A line, 368 mice were observed, with 74 of 203 genotype-positive mice expressing a positive phenotype; epidermal hyperkeratosis of less than 1 cm2 was not considered a positive phenotype. The phenotype, as defined, exhibited incomplete penetrance and was expressed in 36% of K14-Fyn genotype-positive mice in both lines and all crosses. No epidermal hyperkeratosis was seen in 165 genotype-negative mice. In the K14-Fyn/Srcasm crosses, 148 mice were observed. One of 46 K14-Fyn/Srcasm mice exhibited a phenotype, whereas 13 of 32 K14-Fyn mice in these crosses had a phenotype. 43 K14-Srcasm and 27 littermate controls did not exhibit any epidermal hyperkeratosis. In the K14-Fyn/Srcasm-P crosses, 108 mice were observed. 15 of 34 K14-Fyn/Srcasm-P and 6 of 17 K14-Fyn mice maintained the phenotype. 35 K14-Srcasm-P and 20 littermate controls demonstrated no epidermal hyperplasia. All mice were handled in accord with University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee Protocol 705452. A two-sided Fisher's exact test was used to determine the statistical significance of phenotype expression.Histologic and Immunohistochemical Analysis—Skin samples from the back, abdomen, ear, tail, and footpad were fixed overnight in 10% buffered formalin. Tissues were subjected to standard processing followed by paraffin embedding. Five-micron-thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For immunohistochemistry, ear or back skin sections of 1-week-old mice were deparaffinized, rehydrated, blocked with 10% goat serum, and then incubated with the specified primary antibody, biotinylated secondary antibodies, streptavidinhorseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase conjugate, and colorimetric substrates. Hematoxylin or Nuclear Fast Red was used for counter-staining. Sections were incubated with 3% H2O2 solution to block endogenous peroxidase activity when streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase was used. Prior to BrdUrd or Ki-67 immunostaining, antigen retrieval was performed by boiling sections in 10 mm sodium citrate solution (pH 6.0) for 10 min. Photomicrographs were obtained using a Leica DC300 digital camera coupled to a Zeiss Axiophot microscope; all paired photos were obtained under identical conditions. The frequency of BrdUrd and Ki-67 staining in control and K14-Fyn mice was quantified by determining the percentage of positive nuclei. For BrdUrd staining: control, 12% positive nuclei, n = 382; K14-Fyn, 21% positive nuclei, n = 620. For Ki-67 staining: control, 52 positive nuclei/344 cells; K14-fyn, 431 positive nuclei/1544 cells. A Pearson Chi-squared test was applied to determine the statistical significance of positive staining percentages.In Vivo BrdUrd Labeling of Transgenic Mice—Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 μl (1 mg) of BrdUrd solution and sacrificed 1 h later. Skin was cut, formalin-fixed, and processed for BrdUrd immunohistochemistry. Proliferation indices were determined by counting positive nuclei. p values were calculated using a Pearson Chi-squared test. BrdUrd indices (% positive nuclear staining) were: control, 12.0%, n = 382; K14-Fyn, 20.5%, n = 620, p = 0.001. Ki-67 indices were: control, 15.1%, n = 344; K14-Fyn, 27.9%, n = 1544, p = <0.001.Antibodies—α-HA antibody (clone 3F10, Roche Applied Science) was used at 1/100 for immunohistochemistry (IHC). Activated Src family kinase antibody (phospho-Tyr-416) (Cell Signaling Technology) was used at 1/25 for IHC, and 1/1000 for Western blotting. α-p44/42 MAP kinase antibody and α-phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) were used at 1/100 for IHC and 1/1000 for Western blotting. α-Fyn (SC-16, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1/100 for IHC and 1:1000 for Western blotting. α-Mouse keratin 6 antibody (PRB-169P, Covance) was used at 1/150 for IHC and at 1/1000 for Western blotting. α-Ki-67 antigen antibody (NCLL-Ki67-MM1, Novocastra Laboratories, Ltd.) was used at 1/100 for IHC. α-Phospho-PDK1 (Ser-241) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) was used at 1/100 for IHC. α-BrdUrd antibody (Roche Applied Science) was used at 1/10 for IHC. α-β-Actin antibody (Ab 6276, Abcam) was used at 1/5000 for Western blotting. α-GFP (catalog No. 2555, Cell Signaling Technology) antibody was used at 1/1000 for Western blotting. α-Srcasm antibody was used at 1/1000 for Western blotting (23Seykora J.T.M.L.

Isolated skin was subjected to trypsin digestion (0.25%, overnight at 4 °C) and agitation to generate a cell suspension. Cells were plated on rat type I collagen-coated dishes, cultured in MCDB-153 medium with supplements (14Li W. Marshall C. Mei L. Dzubow L. Schmults C. Dans M. Seykora J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6036-6046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and maintained at 34 °C in an atmosphere of 8% CO2. Keratinocytes were used at passage 3 or 4; cells at ∼60–70% confluence were infected with Ad-Fyn (murine Fyn) or control virus at the indicated m.o.i., and were analyzed 16 h after infection.Transfection Studies—COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotic (200 units/ml ampicillin and 200 mg/ml streptomycin). For EGF stimulation, serum was decreased to 0.5%. Murine cDNAs of HA-Srcasm, Fyn, or specified mutants were cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Srcasm GAT domain mutant lacks residues 199–287. Activated murine Fyn is a Y528F mutation (26Davidson D. Fournel M. Veillette A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10956-10963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinase-weak Fyn is a K296R mutation (2Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar). As a transfection control, some cells were transfected with 0.25 μg of E-GFP Living Colors plasmid (BD Biosciences). Cells at ∼60–70% confluency were transfected for 5 h with the indicated expression vectors using Lipofectamine and recovered in medium plus serum for 16 h before lysis. Transfected cells were subjected to the following treatments before lysis: 10 mm ammonium chloride (for 1 h); proteasomal inhibitors (lactacystin at 10 μm for 1, 3, and 4 h; MG132 at 0.1 mm for 1, 3, and 4 h; ALLN at 0.1 mm for 1, 3, and 4 h; ALLN, MG132, and lactacystin for 1 h); and lysosomal protease inhibitors (E64 at 0.1 mm for 1, 3, and 4 h; leupeptin at 0.1 mm for 1, 3, and 4 h; E64 and leupeptin for 1 h).For doxycycline-induced Srcasm expression, 0.5 μg of pcDNA 3.1 Fyn plasmid was co-transfected with empty vectors or pCMV-rtTA (reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator) + pTRE-Srcasm (1.0 μg each). Some cells were incubated with 10, 50, or 100 ng/ml doxycycline-containing medium for 6 h prior to lysis.Immunoblotting—Cell and tissue lysates were prepared using a radio-immune precipitation assay buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (14Li W. Marshall C. Mei L. Dzubow L. Schmults C. Dans M. Seykora J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6036-6046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Lysates were incubated on ice for 15 min and then cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Super-natants were assayed for protein content using the MicroBCA protein assay kit (Pierce Chemical Co.). Aliquots of lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PolyScreen (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Western blotting was conducted in a standard manner with the indicated antibodies and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit as described by the manufacturer (Lumilight Plus, Roche Applied Science). Band densitometry was performed using a Canon LiDE 50 flatbed scanner and Scion image analysis software. Values are standardized to actin levels.Quantitative RT-PCR for Fyn Transcript—Transfected cells were lysed in TRIzol reagent, and total RNA was isolated. Total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using poly(dT). Equivalent amounts of cDNA were subjected to quantitative RT-PCR to detect Fyn transcript using Sybr Green technology on an MJ Research Opticon 2 system.RESULTSPhenotype of Fyn and Srcasm Transgenic Mice—Two independent K14-Fyn founder mice exhibited epidermal scaling with hair loss on the snouts and hindquarters (Fig. 1a). K14-Fyn progeny exhibited diffuse epidermal scale at 2–3 days post-natal, which was prominent by 7 days (Fig. 1b). Approximately, 10% of the affected pups died by 1 week of age; such pups were runted and exhibited decreased feeding activity. Over a period of few weeks, diffuse scaling coalesced into prominent hyper-keratotic plaques lacking hair; these plaques usually resolved by 8 weeks (Fig. 1c). The scaling phenotype was observed through 7 generations and was not seen in transgene-negative mice (n = 165). No spontaneous epidermal tumors were seen in 25 phenotype-positive, unstimulated mice carried to 6 months.K14-Fyn mice were crossed with K14-Srcasm or K14-Srcasm-P mice, a mutant not phosphorylated by Fyn, to generate K14-Fyn/Srcasm and K14-Fyn/Srcasm-P double transgenic lines. K14-Fyn/Srcasm double transgenic mice lacked the scaly phenotype; this decreased phenotypic incidence was statistically significant compared with that of K14-Fyn littermates (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1d). In contrast, K14-Fyn/Srcasm-P double transgenic mice maintained the scaly phenotype with an incidence equivalent to K14-Fyn parent lines and littermates (Fig. 1d). The K14-Srcasm (n = 318) and K14-Srcasm-P (n = 232) strains did not exhibit a hyperproliferative phenotype (Fig. 1d). The numbers of mice characterized for each strain with their corresponding phenotype and phenotypic incidence are shown in Table 1.TABLE 1Phenotype and genotype of mice studied The numbers of genotype-positive mice from each strain are provided. The numbers of phenotype positive (> cm2 of hyperkeratosis) mice are also indicated.

Runted K14-Fyn pups demonstrated hyperkeratosis of the dorsal tongue that correlated with loss of the filiform papillae and increased SFK activity (Fig. 2c).Characterization of K14-Fyn/Srcasm and Fyn/Srcasm-P Mice—The thickened epidermis of K14-Fyn transgenic mice normalizes when this line is crossed with a K14-Srcasm line (Figs. 1d and 3a). Phenotype resolution in K14-Fyn/Srcasm mice correlates with increased Srcasm expression and decreased levels of Fyn, activated SFKs, and keratin 6 (Figs. 3). The K14-Fyn/Srcasm-P mice maintained a hyperkeratotic epidermis demonstrating high levels of Fyn, activated SFKs, and keratin 6 (Fig. 3a). Subtle activation of SFKs and mildly increased Fyn levels could be detected via immunohistochemistry in the K14-Srcasm mice but not in the control or K14-Srcasm-P mice. These findings suggest that endogenous SFK levels coupled with supraphysiologic Srcasm levels may result in impaired down-regulation of activated SFKs. Such findings are supported by previous experiments in primary human keratinocytes (14Li W. Marshall C. Mei L. Dzubow L. Schmults C. Dans M. Seykora J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6036-6046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These data suggest that with endogenous Fyn levels, increased native Srcasm expression may increase levels of activated SFKs; however, with supraphysiologic levels of SFK activation, as in the K14-Fyn mice, increased Srcasm levels promote Fyn down-regulation.FIGURE 3Comparative analysis of transgenic lines. a, sections of ear skin from 1-week-old pups of the indicated genotypes were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H+E) for the following antigens: HA epitope on Srcasm transgene, Fyn, levels of activated SFKs (pY416), and keratin 6. b, Western blot analysis of transgenic skin lysates.

Their replication initiates at two conserved sequences, a dodecamer, known as the universal minicircle sequence (UMS), and a hexamer, which are located at the replication origins of the minicircle L and H strands, respectively. A UMS-binding protein (UMSBP) binds specifically the 12-mer UMS sequence and a 14-mer sequence that contains the conserved hexamer in their single-stranded DNA conformation. In vivo cross-linking analyses reveal the binding of UMSBP to kinetoplast DNA networks in the cell. Furthermore, UMSBP binds in vitro to native minicircle origin fragments, carrying the UMSBP recognition sequences. UMSBP binding at the replication origin induces conformational changes in the bound DNA through its folding, aggregation and condensation.

In the species Crithidia fasciculata the kDNA network consists of ∼5000 duplex DNA minicircles of 2.5 kbp and 50 maxicircles of 37 kbp that are interlocked topologically to form a DNA network (1Ray D.S. Plasmid. 1987; 17: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 5Shlomai J. Curr. Mol. Med. 2004; 4: 623-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Maxicircles contain mitochondrial genes, encoding mitochondrial proteins and rRNA. Minicircles encode for guide RNAs that function in the process of mitochondrial mRNA editing (6Stuart K. Allen T.E. Heidmann S. Seiwert S.D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 8Simpson L. Thiemann O.H. Savill N.J. Alfonzo J.D. Maslov D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6986-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Minicircles in most trypanosomatids species are heterogeneous in sequence. However, a few structural and sequence motifs are conserved in all the minicircles within networks of a given species as well as in minicircles of different trypanosomatid species. These include two short sequences that are associated with the process of replication initiation, which are located 70–100 nucleotides apart in the minicircle molecule; they are the dodecameric sequence GGGGTTGGTGTA, designated the universal minicircle sequence (UMS) and the hexameric sequence ACGCCC. These sequences have been mapped to the sites of the replication origins of the minicircle light (L) and heavy (H) strands, respectively (for review, see Refs. 1Ray D.S. Plasmid. 1987; 17: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 5Shlomai J. Curr. Mol. Med. 2004; 4: 623-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Comparison of the complete minicircle sequences of several species of trypanosomatids reveals that minicircles from different trypanosomatids contain either one (Trypanosoma brucei GenBank™ accession number M15323; Leishmania major, GenBank™ accession number Z32845), two (C. fasciculata, GenBank™ accession number M19266), or three (Trypanosoma cruzi, GenBank™ accession number X56188) copies of the conserved origin region. The two conserved origin regions in C. fasciculata kDNA minicircles are designated OriA and OriB. Each of these origin regions includes the two conserved origin sequences. According to the currently accepted model for kDNA replication, only one of the origins is active during minicircle replication, and the active origin is randomly selected in each replication cycle (9Birkenmeyer L. Ray D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2362-2368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the replication of mitochondrial DNA in other eukaryotic cells, which takes place throughout the cell cycle, kDNA replicates only once, during S phase of the cell cycle, approximately in parallel with the replication of the nuclear DNA (10Woodward R. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 49-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to the current model for kDNA replication, minicircles are released during S-phase from the center of the network by the decatenation activity of a type II DNA topoisomerase and are translocated to the kineto-flagellar zone, located between the kDNA network and the flagellum basal body (11Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Each minicircle is an individual replicon that replicates unidirectionally in a semi-discontinuous mechanism, forming two gapped and nicked progeny molecules (12Birkenmeyer L. Sugisaki H. Ray D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2384-2392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Minicircles are then transferred onto two antipodal sites, flanking the kDNA disk, in which primer removal, repair of the Okazaki fragment gaps, and reattachment of the progeny minicircles to the network occurs. The final gap-filling and sealing of the topologically linked minicircles take place before the network division (13Kitchin P.A. Klein V.A. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3844-3851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several of the proteins involved in the replication of the kDNA network have been identified, including the origin-binding protein, designated UMS-binding protein (UMSBP). UMSBP has been purified from C. fasciculata, and its encoding gene and genomic locus were cloned and analyzed (14Tzfati Y. Abeliovich H. Kapeller I. Shlomai J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6891-6895Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Tzfati Y. Shlomai J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 94: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Genes encoding for homologous proteins have been identified in other trypanosomatid species (18Hertz-Fowler C. Peacock C.S. Wood V. Aslett M. Kerhornou A. Mooney P. Tivey A. Berriman M. Hall N. Rutherford K. Parkhill J. Ivens A.C. Rajandream M.A. Barrell B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 339-343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (supplemental Table 1) The protein binds specifically to the two conserved sequences located at the minicircle replication origins, the UMS dodecamer and a 14-mer sequence (H14) containing the conserved hexamer core and 8 flanking nucleotides, in their single-stranded conformation (14Tzfati Y.

This motif forms a compact zinc finger that has been associated with the binding of single-stranded nucleic acids (20Katz R.A. Jentoft J.E. BioEssays. 1989; 11: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Rajavashisth T.B. Taylor A.K. Andalibi A. Svenson K.L. Lusis A.J. Science. 1989; 245: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We have previously reported on the effect of redox on the binding of UMSBP to the origin sequence as well as on the protein oligomerization and suggested that redox potential may play a major role in the regulation of UMSBP action at the replication origin (23Onn I. Milman-Shtepel N. Shlomai J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Immunolocalization of UMSBP within the kineto-plast has revealed two distinct protein foci at the kineto-flagellar zone, near the suggested minicircle replication site (24Abu-Elneel K. Robinson D.R. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. Shlomai J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As a single-stranded DNA-binding protein, an intriguing question is, How does UMSBP bind the native origin in the duplex kDNA minicircle? This question had been addressed in earlier studies, demonstrating that the minicircle origin region is distorted and adopts a single-strand conformation (25Avrahami D. Tzfati Y. Shlomai J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10511-10515Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Yet no direct evidence has been provided in these studies for the binding of the full-length native origin, including both the L-strand and H-strand initiation sites, by UMSBP, and biochemical and structural analyses of this intriguing nucleoprotein complex have not yet been described. In this study we present evidence for the interaction of UMSBP with kDNA networks in vivo. We further describe the interactions of UMSBP with the sequences conserved at the native minicircle replication origin and show that UMSBP binding induces a significant conformational change in the DNA structure at the native minicircle replication origin.

Biol. 1993; 13: 7766-7773Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and the preparation of pure recombinant UMSBP were conducted as we have previously described (23Onn I. Milman-Shtepel N. Shlomai J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In Vivo Cross-linking and Purification of Kinetoplast Nucleoprotein Complexes—700 ml of C. fasciculata cell culture were grown to logarithmic phase (4.4 × 107 cells/ml) as described elsewhere (14Tzfati Y.

Cross-linking of kinetoplasts and their partial purification were carried out following the procedure of Xu and Ray (26Xu C. Ray D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1786-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with modifications as follows. Formaldehyde (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.75%, and the cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with shaking followed by chilling in ice water. Cells were harvested in a Sorvall GS-3 rotor at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and once in NET buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm EDTA). Cells were then resuspended to final density of 1.25 × 109 cells/ml in NET buffer containing 3% sarkosyl and heated for 10 min at 65 °C. The cell lysate was fractionated through a series of three step gradients as described by Xu and Ray (26Xu C. Ray D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1786-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) as follows. Each 12.0-ml lysate was loaded on the top of a step gradient containing a layer of 23 ml of 20% sucrose in TNES buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Sarkosyl) and a bottom layer of 3 ml of 20% sucrose in TNES, containing NaI to yield a density of 1.36 g/ml, and was centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 rpm in a Beckman SW28 rotor at 25 °C. The bottom 7.6 ml was discarded, and the step-gradient was refilled from the bottom with 5 ml of 20% sucrose in TNES, 3 ml of 20% sucrose, NaI solution (1.36 g/ml), and 3 ml of saturated NaI in TNE (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) and was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 10 min in a Beckman SW28 rotor at 25 °C. The bottom 10 ml of the gradient was fractionated into 10 1.0-ml fractions. To monitor their content of kDNA, samples withdrawn from the gradient fractions were electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The DNA-containing fractions (5Shlomai J. Curr. Mol. Med. 2004; 4: 623-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 8Simpson L. Thiemann O.H. Savill N.J. Alfonzo J.D. Maslov D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The pellets, containing kDNA networks, were resuspended in 18 ml of TNES. Each 9.0-ml suspension of DNA was re-centrifuged as described above through a step gradient containing (from top to bottom) 23 ml of 20% sucrose, 3 ml of 20% sucrose, NaI (1.36 g/ml) in TNES, and 3 ml of saturated NaI solution in TNE. The bottom 10 ml of the gradient was fractionated, and the fractions containing kDNA were diluted and centrifuged as described above. The nucleoprotein pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of TNES and loaded onto a 5.0 ml of sucrose/NaI linear gradient at the range of 10–30% sucrose, saturated NaI in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl. The gradients were centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 20 min in a Beckman SW55.5 rotor at 25 °C. 20 fractions of 250 μl were collected from the bottom of the tubes. Samples withdrawn from each fraction were analyzed for their kDNA content by electrophoresis in ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel followed by Southern blot hybridization analysis using a radioactively labeled minicircle probe following the published procedures (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-9.58Google Scholar). Two of the DNA-containing fractions were randomly selected for further analysis. Each fraction was divided into halves. One-half was incubated overnight at 65 °C to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking of the nucleoprotein complex, and the other was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The fractions were then added to loading buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then electrophoresed in 16.5% SDS-PAGE as described below along with protein markers and recombinant UMSBP. Gels were analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-UMSBP antibodies and Envision+ System HRP (DakoCytonation) secondary antibodies by ECL as described below. Immunoprecipitation of Nucleoprotein Complexes in Vitro—OriA region of the minicircle was amplified by PCR, using as template either a C. fasciculata kDNA minicircle or a plasmid containing a full-length minicircle (linearized by cleavage at its XhoI site). All the sets of primers (A-I) used for preparation of wild-type (WT) and mutated origin region in this work are described in supplemental Table 2. The DNA fragments were biotinylated using 5′-biotinylated primers. PCR amplification was carried out using Failsafe PCR kit (Epicenter Technologies). PCR products were purified using PCR cleaning column (Qiagen). PCR using primers set A (supplemental Table 2) yielded a 313-bp fragment (positions 319–631 (28Sugisaki H. Ray D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 23: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)) that includes the OriA. Mutated OriA sequences were generated in two steps by PCR amplification using in the first step a 313-bp fragment of kDNA minicircle as the DNA template and two sets of mutated primers for each mutant, primers set B and C (supplemental Table 2), yielding two fragments with an overlap (underlined) at the H14 site. In the second step the fragments described above were used as templates with primers set A, yielding a 313-bp fragment that includes a mutated H14 (positions 396–409) and WT UMS sequence. In the first step primers set D and E yielded two fragments with an overlap (underlined, supplemental Table 2) at the UMS site. In the second step the fragments described above were used as template with the primers set A (supplemental Table 2), yielding a 313-bp fragment that included a WT H14 and mutated UMS sequences (positions 489–500). The template for the generation of a double mutant, mutated in both H14 and UMS was the PCR product of the 313-bp fragment that includes a WT H14 and mutated UMS. The two steps of PCR amplification were conducted as in the production of the mutated H14, as described above. PCR products produced in the first and second steps of the preparation of all mutants and the WT were purified by electrophoresis in agarose gel followed by their extraction using a gel extraction preparation (QIAquick, Qiagen). Binding of UMSBP to the double-stranded origin fragment was assayed in a 10-μl reaction mixture containing 150 ng (0.75 pmol) of the origin-containing PCR-amplified DNA fragments, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reactions started by the addition of UMSBP (7.5 pmol) as indicated were incubated at 30 °C for 60 min. The reaction mixtures were cooled on ice for 10 min, and nucleoprotein complexes were cross-linked by UV light (UV Stratalinker 1800, Stratagene) irradiated at 306 mJ/cm2 on ice. Reactions were adjusted to 200 μl by the addition of IP buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mm EDTA) and added to protein A beads preincubated for 2 h with rabbit anti-UMSBP antibodies. The reactions were incubated overnight at 4 °C with constant rotation. The beads were washed 3 times, with 0.7 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and then twice with 0.7 ml of PBS. The beads were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA containing 1% sarkosyl and 2 mg/ml proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C followed by overnight incubation at 60 °C. The DNA was then electrophoresed in 2% agarose gel, vacuum-blotted onto a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and analyzed by Southern blot hybridization using a minicircle DNA probe. Quantification of radioactive signals was conducted using BAS2000 (Fuji) phosphorimaging. Preparation of Minicircle Origin (OriA) and Mutated OriA Fragments for Binding and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Analysis (EMSA) Analyses—The minicircle fragment containing the OriA region of C. fasciculata kDNA (see above) was PCR-amplified using Failsafe PCR kit (Epicenter Technologies). PCR primer set F (supplemental Table 2) was used for the preparation of the WT OriA-containing fragment yielding a 142-bp fragment (positions 377–518). Mutated OriA sequences were generated by PCR amplification using primers that include mutated origins. The 142-bp fragment containing OriA served as template. Primers sets (supplementary Table 2) were as follows. Set G yielded a 144-bp fragment (positions 377–520) that included a mutated H14 and WT UMS sequences; set H yielded a 144-bp fragment (positions 377–520) that included a WT H14 and a mutated UMS sequence, and set I yielded a 144-bp fragment (positions 377–520) that included a double mutant (a mutated H14 and a mutated UMS sequence). The WT and mutated PCR products were purified by electrophoresis in agarose gel followed by their extraction from the gel using a gel extraction preparation (QIAquick). The primers used for the preparation of ligands for micrococcal nuclease digestion of nucleoprotein complexes were 5′-32P-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (MBI Fermentas). EMSA—Analyses were carried out as described previously (14Tzfati Y. Abeliovich H. Kapeller I. Shlomai J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Samples of UMSBP as indicated were incubated in the 10-μl binding reaction mixture containing 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 0.25 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and 25 fmol of 5′-32P-labeled DNA ligand as indicated. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min as indicated. The reaction mixtures were cooled on ice for 10 min, and nucleoprotein complexes were cross-linked by UV light as described above. The products were loaded onto an 8% native polyacrylamide gel (1:29, bisacrylamide/acrylamide) in TAE buffer (6.7 mm Tris acetate, 3.3 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). Electrophoresis was conducted at 2–4 °C and 16 V/cm for 3 h. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Analysis—SPR studies were conducted using a BIAcore 3000 at the BIAcore unit, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. A 5′-biotinylated 313 bp DNA was prepared using primer set A (supplementary Table 2: the primer 5′-CCATGGGTGTGTTTGTGTTG TTCTGG-3′ is 5′-biotinylated). Biotinylated DNA was immobilized to an SA sensor chip (BIAcore), as recommended by the manufacturer (60–500 RU). DNA binding activity of the proteins was measured by injection of 100–300 nm UMSBP into the flow channel, using an empty flow-channel as background. Kinetic analysis was performed by automated injection of various protein concentrations (30 μl/min, 3-min association time and 3-min dissociation time) in 10 mm Hepes pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2. No mass transfer was detected under these conditions. Binding constants were calculated by BIAevaluation 3.1 program using a heterogeneous ligand binding model. Micrococcal Nuclease Assay—Samples of UMSBP as indicated were added to a reaction mixture containing 0.25 pmol of 5′-32P-labeled 313-bp minicircle DNA fragment (positions 319–631, GenBank™ accession number M19266), 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction was incubated for 60 min at 30 °C followed by the addition of 1 unit of micrococcal nuclease (MBI Fermentas) for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 25 mm EGTA, and the reaction products were loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel (1:19, bisacrylamide/acrylamide) along with a sequencing reaction of minicircle DNA using the ddNTPs procedure (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and a 5′-CCATGGGTGTGTTTGTGTTG-3′ primer. Thermodynamic Analysis—Structural properties of the C. fasciculata minicircle sequence (GenBank™ accession number M19266) were analyzed for DNA curvature according to Bolshoy et al. (29Bolshoy A. McNamara P. Harrington R.E. Trifonov E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2312-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) and propeller-twist, as a measure of helix rigidity, as described by El Hassan and Calladine (30el Calladine C.R. Hassan M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Window size was 100 bp, and slide was 10 bp. Analysis of Proteins by SDS-PAGE—Protein samples in loading buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.85, 4% SDS, 3.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 10 mm EDTA were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and loaded onto a 16.5% Tris-Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel (31Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10457) Google Scholar) along with protein size markers (Rainbow pre-stained low molecular weight, Amersham Biosciences). Upper electrophoresis buffer was 0.1 m Tris-Tricine, pH 8.25, containing 0.1% SDS; lower buffer was 0.2 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.9. Western Blot Analysis—Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, as described above. Protein bands were transferred onto a Protran BA85 cellulose nitrate membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were blocked by incubation for 30 min in 5% skim dry milk (Difco) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and probed for 90 min with anti-UMSBP antibodies that were raised in rabbit. Membranes were probed for 45 min with a 1:13,000 dilution horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (DacoCytonation) followed by ECL detection as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). UMSBP Interacts in Vivo with kDNA Networks—UMSBP was immunolocalized within the kinetoplast to two discrete foci located at the kineto-flagellar zone (24Abu-Elneel K. Robinson D.R. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. Shlomai J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) at the site implicated with kDNA minicircle replication initiation (11Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis of synchronized C. fasciculata culture revealed a higher abundance of UMSBP at this site during S-phase, in correlation with the progress of kDNA replication. However, whereas binding of UMSBP to single-stranded origin sequences has been previously demonstrated in DNA binding assays in vitro, its interaction with native kDNA networks in vivo has not yet been challenged. This question was addressed here using an in vivo protein-DNA cross-linking approach following a procedure modified from Xu and Ray (26Xu C. Ray D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1786-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Lysates prepared from cross-linked cells were fractionated by centrifugation through a series of sucrose/NaI stepwise gradients (26Xu C. Ray D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1786-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and pooled kDNA-containing fractions obtained were fractionated by a linear sucrose/NaI gradient. Two kDNA-containing fractions (Fig. 1A) from the final linear sucrose/NaI gradient were monitored by SDS-PAGE analysis followed by Western blot analysis using anti-UMSBP antibodies either with or without heat reversal of the nucleoprotein cross-linking (Fig. 1B). In both kDNA-containing fractions, reversal of the formaldehyde cross-linking by heating at 65 °C overnight (26Xu C. Ray D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1786-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) resulted in the release of UMSBP as indicated by the subsequent SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis, whereas only traces of protein were released from the untreated complexes (Fig. 1B). Under the denaturing and reducing conditions used in this analysis the majority of released protein migrated in the gel as monomers. The minor slower migrating bands observed (arrowheads, Fig. 1B) may represent traces of higher oligomeric forms of UMSBP, generated under the cross-linking conditions, that resisted the denaturing and reducing electrophoresis conditions. These results indicate that UMSBP interacts in vivo with kDNA networks. Interactions of UMSBP with free kDNA minicircles are undetectable by the method employed here, since the purification of the large kDNA-protein complexes in the sucrose/NaI gradients apparently excludes unlinked free minicircles. UMSBP Binds in Vitro Double-stranded DNA Fragments Carrying the Minicircle Replication Origin—We have previously shown that UMSBP is a single-stranded DNA-binding protein that binds specifically the 12-mer UMS and the 14-mer sequence containing the core hexamer (H14) in their single-stranded conformation (14Tzfati Y.

In binding competition analyses duplex native kDNA minicircles, either free or topologically linked, competed efficiently with a radioactively labeled single-stranded UMS on the binding of UMSBP (25Avrahami D. Tzfati Y. Shlomai J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10511-10515Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, no direct evidence has yet been reported, demonstrating the binding of UMSBP to the native minicircle origin, which includes both its UMS and H14 sequences in a duplex kDNA conformation. To examine the binding of UMSBP at the origin and its dependence upon the presence of its UMS and/or H14 binding sites"

The V1 complex of Thermus thermophilus V-ATPase has the subunit composition of A3B3DF, in which the A and B subunits form a hexameric ring structure. A central stalk composed of the D and F subunits penetrates the ring. In this study, we investigated the pathway for assembly of the V1 complex by reconstituting the V1 complex from the monomeric A and B subunits and DF subcomplex in vitro. Assembly of these components into the V1 complex required binding of ATP to the A subunit, although hydrolysis of ATP is not necessary. In the absence of the DF subcomplex, the A and B monomers assembled into A1B1 and A3B3 subcomplexes in an ATP binding-dependent manner, suggesting that ATP binding-dependent interaction between the A and B subunits is a crucial step of assembly into V1 complex. Kinetic analysis of assembly of the A and B monomers into the A1B1 heterodimer using fluorescence resonance energy transfer indicated that the A subunit binds ATP prior to binding the B subunit. Kinetics of binding of a fluorescent ADP analog, N-methylanthraniloyl ADP (mant-ADP), to the monomeric A subunit also supported the rapid nucleotide binding to the A subunit.

Acidification of intracellular acidic compartments of eukaryotic cell, such as lysosomes, endosomes, or synaptic vesicles is important for various cellular processes, including receptor-mediated endocytosis and secondary transport, and is accomplished by ATP-driven proton translocation of the vacuolar-type H+-ATPases (V-ATPases), 3The abbreviations used are: V-ATPase, vacuolar-type H+-ATPase; mant-ADP, N-methylanthraniloyl ADP; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; KTAA, K234A and T235A mutations in the A subunit; TSSA, S232A and T235S mutations in the A subunit; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. which is localized in the membranes of these compartments (1Stevens T.H.

V-ATPases are also found in the plasma membrane of some specialized cells, such as macrophages (4Swallow C.J. Grinstein S. Rotstein O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7645-7654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), renal intercalated cells (5Brown D. Gluck S. Hartwig J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1637-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), or osteoclasts (6Väänänen H.K. Karhukorpi E.K. Sundquist K. Wallmark B. Roininen I. Hentunen T. Tuukkanen J. Lakkakorpi P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1305-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), and transport proton from the cytosol to the extracellular space. It is known that the V-ATPases in the plasma membrane is also responsible for various cellular functions such as acidification of extracellular space or homeostasis of pH in the cytosol (1Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 3Kane P.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). V-ATPases are large protein complexes consisting of two major parts, a peripheral V1 complex and a membrane-embedded Vo complex. V1 and Vo are responsible for ATP hydrolysis and proton translocation, respectively. Proton translocation at Vo is accompanied by rotation of the membrane-spanning c-ring, which is driven by ATP hydrolysis at V1 (7Imamura H. Nakano M. Noji H. Muneyuki E. Ohkuma S. Yoshida M.

Biomembr. 2005; 37: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition to the role in proton translocation, it was recently suggested that Vo complex is directly involved in membrane fusion events (11Peters C. Bayer M.J. Bühler S. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Mayer A. Nature. 2001; 409: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 12Hiesinger P.R. Fayyazuddin A. Mehta S.Q. Rosenmund T. Schulze K.L. Zhai R.G. Verstreken P. Cao Y. Zhou Y. Kunz J.

Homologues of eukaryotic V-ATPases have also been found in the plasma membranes of some bacteria (10Yokoyama K. Imamura H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2005; 37: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 13Murata T. Takase K. Yamato I. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol.

Biomembr. 2003; 35: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although the bacterial V-ATPases have a simpler subunit composition and function as an ATP synthase or Na+ pump rather than a proton pump, all subunits have significant homology with eukaryotic counterparts (10Yokoyama K. Imamura H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2005; 37: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 15Yokoyama K. Nagata K. Imamura H. Ohkuma S. Yoshida M. Tamakoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42686-42691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is known that most of the V-ATPase subunits are essential for formation of a functional VoV1 complex in vivo (1Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). When any of the genes encoding V-ATPase subunits, except H subunit, are deleted, formation of V1,Vo, and/or VoV1 complexes is inhibited. Assembly of V-ATPase subunits also requires other proteins or compounds. For example in yeast, it is known that Vma12p/Vma21p/Vma22p proteins, which are not final components of the V-ATPase, aid the assembly of Vo subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum (16Graham L.A. Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Malkus P. Graham L.A. Stevens T.H. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5075-5091Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and that a protein complex, RAVE, which binds to the free cytosolic V1 complex, plays a role in association of V1 and Vo (18Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 19Smardon A.M. Tarsio M. Kane P.M. J. Biol.

Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16618-16623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and in vivo (21Liu Q. Leng X.H. Newman P.R. Vasilyeva E. Kane P.M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11750-11756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) conditions, binding of ATP to the A subunit is important for assembly. Another important feature of assembly of V-ATPase components is that proton translocation by V-ATPase is regulated by reversible association/dissociation of V1 and Vo complexes (22Kane P.M. Smardon A.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The proton translocation activity of the V-ATPase is completely abolished by the dissociation of the V1 complex from the Vo complex. Here, we report in vitro reconstitution of the V1 complex of Thermus thermophilus from its components. The V1 complex of T. thermophilus V-ATPase is composed of 8 subunits with a subunit composition of A3B3DF (15Yokoyama K. Nagata K. Imamura H. Ohkuma S. Yoshida M. Tamakoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42686-42691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The A and B subunits form a hexameric A3B3 ring, in which A and B are arranged alternately, and the D and F subunits constitute a central rotor shaft, which penetrates into the cavity of the A3B3 ring. We investigated the role of ATP in V1 formation in detail, and found that ATP binding to the A subunit is a crucial step for assembly of the V1 components into the complex. Furthermore, potential intermediate subcomplexes were identified. We also describe a model for the assembly of the V1 complex. Chemicals—ATP, ADP, and bovine serum albumin were products of Sigma. AMP-PNP and restriction endonucleases were purchased from Roche. N-Methylanthraniloyl ADP (mant-ADP) was purchased from Invitrogen. Cy3-maleimide and Cy5-maleimide were from GE Healthcare. Other reagents were from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan), unless otherwise stated. Expression and Purification of Proteins—Expression of the T. thermophilus V1 complex (A3B3DF) in Escherichia coli containing a His10 tag at the N terminus of the A subunit was performed as described previously (23Imamura H. Ikeda C. Yoshida M. Yokoyama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18085-18090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The E. coli cells were suspended in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 20 mm imidazole-HCl, 0.3 m NaCl and disrupted by sonication, followed by heat treatment at 65 °C for 30 min. After removal of denatured E. coli proteins by centrifugation at 19,000 × g for 60 min, the supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (Qiagen), which was then washed thoroughly and eluted with 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.2 m imidazole-HCl, 0.3 m NaCl. The buffer was switched to 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EDTA by ultrafiltration (AmiconUltra, Millipore) and the solution was applied to a UNO-Q column (Bio-Rad). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl, from 0 to 400 mm. V1 and the A subunit were eluted in different fractions and were stored at 4 °C. The B subunit of T. thermophilus was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)-CodonPlus-RP (Stratagene) harboring a plasmid pHis-B, in which genes for the B subunits are inserted between the NdeI and EcoRI sites of pET17b (Novagen). A His6 tag was introduced at the N terminus of the B subunit. The B subunit was purified basically by the same procedure used for V1 and stored at 4 °C. The DF subcomplex of T. thermophilus was expressed in E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus-RP harboring a plasmid pUC-DF, in which genes for the D and F subunits were inserted tandemly between the EcoRI and SalI sites of pUC18. A His6 tag was fused to the C terminus of the F subunit. The E. coli cells were suspended in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 20 mm imidazole-HCl, 0.3 m NaCl and disrupted by sonication, followed by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 90 min. The supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column, which was then washed thoroughly with 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 60 mm imidazole-HCl, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.05% dodecyl maltoside and eluted with 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.2 m imidazole-HCl, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.05% dodecyl maltoside. Fractions containing DF were pooled and stored at 4 °C. Protein concentration of the V1 complex, the A and B subunits, were determined from UV absorbance calibrated by quantitative amino acid analysis using molar extinction coefficient of 360,000, 82,000, and 42,000 m-1 cm-1, respectively. The protein concentration of the A3B3 subcomplex was determined by the same method assuming that it has the same extinction coefficient as V1. Protein concentrations of the DF subcomplex were estimated with SDS-PAGE by comparing density of D subunit with that of known concentrations of V1. Gel-permeation Chromatography—Gel-permeation chromatography (Superdex HR 200, Amersham Biosciences) was used to analyze assembly and disassembly, and to purify the A3B3 subcomplex. The column was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. Molecular weight standards were purchased from Sigma. Fluorescent Labeling of Proteins—To label the A and B subunits with a fluorescent dye, Glu114 or Glu374 of the A subunit and Thr107 or Lys304 of the B subunit were replaced with cysteine. All intrinsic cysteine residues were changed to serine or alanine (A-Cys28, A-Cys508, and B-Cys268 to Ser, and A-Cys255 to Ala). The A and B subunits, each containing the single introduced cysteine, were purified, and then incubated with 10 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min to reduce the sulfhydryl group of cysteine. After removal of dithiothreitol by gel permeation chromatography equilibrated with 20 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, proteins were incubated with 5-fold molar excess of Cy3-maleimide (A subunit) or Cy5-maleimide (B subunit) at room temperature for 2 h. Non-reacted fluorescent dye was removed with NAP-10 (GE Healthcare) and Superdex HR200. The labeling ratios of dye to protein were 0.85, 0.89, 0.69, and 0.72, respectively, for AE114C-Cy3, AE374C-Cy3, BT107C-Cy5, and BK304C-Cy5 as estimated by spectrophotometry. The molar extinction coefficients used were 150,000 m-1 cm-1 at 550 nm (Cy3) and 250,000 m-1 cm-1 at 650 nm (Cy5). FRET Measurement between A and B Subunits—FRET from the donor (Cy3) in the A subunit to the acceptor (Cy5) in the B subunit was monitored with a fluorescence spectrometer (FP-6500, JASCO). To acquire fluorescent spectra, the donor was selectively excited with light at 532 nm (bandwidth 10 nm) and the fluorescence intensity from 550 to 700 nm was scanned (bandwidth 3 nm). For time course measurements, the donor was excited with light at 532 nm (bandwidth 5 nm) and the fluorescence intensity was measured at 565 nm (bandwidth 5 nm). All measurements were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37 °C. FRET Measurement between mant-ADP and Proteins—To monitor FRET from the tryptophan residue in protein to bound mant-ADP, tryptophan was excited with light at 285 nm (bandwidth 3 nm). For time course measurements, the fluorescence intensity was measured at 435 nm (bandwidth 3 nm). All measurements were carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C, with a fluorometer (FP-6500). ATPase Assay—ATPase activity was measured at 25 °C, as previously described (24Yokoyama K. Muneyuki E. Amano T. Mizutani S. Yoshida M. Ishida M. Ohkuma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20504-20510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein was added to a solution comprised of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, MgATP, and an ATP regenerating system (0.1 mg/ml pyruvate kinase, 0.1 mg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 2 mm phospho-enol-pyruvate, and 0.2 mg/ml NADH), and the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was monitored with a spectrometer (V-550, JASCO). Requirement of ATP for Reconstitution of the V1 Complex in Vitro—The subunit composition of the V1 complex of T. thermophilus is A3B3DF. It is an ATP-driven rotary motor, in which D and F subunits rotate relative to A3B3 hexamer (7Imamura H. Nakano M. Noji H. Muneyuki E. Ohkuma S. Yoshida M. Yokoyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2312-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 9Imamura H. Takeda M. Funamoto S. Shimabukuro K. Yoshida M. Yokoyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17929-17933Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). There are three catalytic sites in one V1 complex. Most of the residues that participate in catalysis are located in the A subunit (2Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). To analyze the assembly process of V1 subunits, the A and B subunits, and DF subcomplex of T. thermophilus were expressed in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 1A). They were mixed together in the absence and presence of ATP 4All nucleotides used in this study were a 1:1 mixture with MgCl2. For example, 1 mm ATP means 1 mm ATP and 1 mm MgCl2. and submitted to native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Native PAGE) to determine whether the V1 complex and/or small subcomplex is formed. In the absence of ATP, no V1 formation was observed (Fig. 1B, lane 3). In contrast, A, B, and DF were assembled into the V1 complex in the presence of ATP (Fig. 1B, lane 4). This is consistent with the previous observation that ATP is required for the in vitro reconstitution of yeast V1 complex from yeast cell extract (20Tomashek J.J. Garrison B.S. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16618-16623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A small band that was observed just below the V1 complex is the A3B3 subcomplex (Fig. 1, B and C), which we describe later. To determine whether both ATP binding and hydrolysis are required or only ATP binding is necessary for V1 formation, we carried out reconstitution experiments using mutant A subunits and an ATP analog. As shown in Fig. 1C, the use of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PNP, instead of ATP supported assembly of subunits into the V1 complex. We also assessed whether the AE257A mutant could be incorporated into the V1 complex. Glu257 in the A subunit is equivalent to Glu190 in the β subunit of Bacillus PS3 F1-ATPase, which has been suggested to be an essential residue for hydrolysis, but not for binding ATP (25Yoshida M. Poser J.W. Allison W.S. Esch F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 148-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Shimabukuro K. Yasuda R. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14731-14736Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). When AE257A was mixed with the B subunit, the DF subcomplex, and ATP, the V1 complex was successfully reconstituted (Fig. 1C, lane 4). These results clearly suggest that hydrolysis of ATP is not necessary for V1 formation. Moreover, A, B, and DF assembled into the V1 complex when incubated with ADP (Fig. 1B, lane 5). Next, we assessed assembly using the AK234A/T235A mutant (hereafter AKTAA mutant), in which the conserved Lys234 and Thr235 within the Walker motif A (GXXXXGKT) of the A subunit were replaced with alanine. It has been reported that the AAA+ protein ClpB with this mutation in the Walker motif has greatly reduced capacity to bind nucleotide (27Watanabe Y.H. Motohashi K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5804-5809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Indeed, the AKTAA mutant lost the ability to bind the fluorescent nucleotide, mant-ADP as described below. As expected, no assembly was observed when the AKTAA mutant was examined (Fig. 1C, lane 5). These results indicate that binding of nucleotide to the catalytic sites is necessary for assembly of the subunits into the V1 complex, and that hydrolysis of ATP is not necessary. Nucleotide-dependent Formation of Subcomplexes—Because T. thermophilus V1 is an assembly of 8 subunits, there should be several intermediate subcomplexes when V1 subunits assemble to form the complex. Existence of intermediates in assembly is consistent with the observation that yeast strains lacking one or more genes encoding V1 subunits accumulate various subcomplexes (28Tomashek J.J. Sonnenburg J.L. Artimovich J.M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10397-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 29Tomashek J.J. Graham L.A. Hutchins M.U. Stevens T.H. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26787-26793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). During reconstitution of the V1 complex, we observed two bands on Native PAGE (Fig. 1D), which migrated slightly faster than the V1 complex. This suggested formation of two large subcomplexes during the assembly process. One subcomplex migrated slower than the V1 complex on Native PAGE even in the absence of DF and contained only A and B subunits (Fig. 1, B, lane 1; D, lane 1; E, lane 3). Thus, this subcomplex should be the A3B3 subcomplex (also see below). The amount of A3B3 assembled from the A and B subunits decreased as the amount of DF subcomplex increased (Fig. 1D). On the other hand, another subcomplex was observed when the amount of DF increased (Fig. 1, D, lane 4 and 5), and contained A, B, and DF (Fig. 1E, lane 2). Because this subcomplex contained 77% of the B subunit compared with V1 (as determined by densitometer and normalized by the amount of D subunit) observed on SDS-PAGE, its subunit composition is thought to be A2B2DF. Next, we purified the A3B3 subcomplex using gel permeation chromatography, and examined whether it can accommodate the DF subcomplex to form the V1 complex. Interestingly, the A3B3 and DF subcomplexes assembled into the V1 complex even in the absence of ATP (Fig. 1F, lane 3). This suggests that the A3B3 subcomplex might be a precursor of the V1 complex, and that ATP, which is obligatory for V1 formation, is not used for the assembly step in which the DF subcomplex is incorporated into the cavity of the A3B3 subcomplex. Although A3B3 and DF assembled into V1 complex in the presence of ATP, formation of the A2B2DF subcomplex was also observed under these conditions (Fig. 1F, lane 4). The A2B2DF subcomplex might assemble from the DF and A1B1 heterodimer, as the A3B3 disassembles in the presence of ATP (see below). It is also likely that A2B2DF is a direct precursor of the V1 complex. However, because of the instability of this subcomplex, this could not be demonstrated. We next investigated the assembly of the A and B subunits in the absence of DF in detail. When the A and B subunits were incubated with ATP, formation of the A3B3 subcomplex was observed as shown in Fig. 2A. The A3B3 subcomplexes were also formed when AMP-PNP or AE257A was used, suggesting that hydrolysis of ATP is unnecessary (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3), although the amount of A3B3 formed was decreased significantly compared with the case where wild-type A subunit and ATP were used. The decrease in the amount of A3B3 observed might suggest that A3B3 is stabilized by hydrolysis of bound ATP. We also analyzed the assembly of the A and B subunits using gel-permeation chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2C, only one peak with an estimated molecular mass of 62 kDa was observed in the absence of ATP. This peak should be a mixture of the monomeric A and B subunits, which have calculated molecular masses of 64 and 53 kDa, respectively. In contrast, additional 309- and 122-kDa peaks were observed in the presence of ATP (Fig. 2C), indicating the formation of the A1B1 heterodimer in addition to the A3B3 subcomplex. Both peaks were also observed when AE257A mutant was used instead of the wild-type A subunit (Fig. 2C), or when AMP-PNP was used instead of ATP (data not shown). The A1B1 heterodimer did not clearly resolve from the B subunit by Native PAGE (Fig. 2B, asterisks). On the other hand, when AKTAA mutant was used neither A3B3 nor A1B1 was observed (Fig. 2C). This indicates that binding of ATP to the A subunit induces or stabilizes interaction between A and B subunits and subsequent formation of A1B1, which would then assemble into the A3B3 complex. Given that the V1 complex did not assemble when ATP was absent or AKTAA was used, the formation of the A1B1 heterodimer induced by ATP binding is most likely the primary step of V1 complex formation. The amount of A3B3 formed was dependent on the concentration of monomeric subunits (Fig. 2D). The A and B subunits must be at or above the critical concentration, which seems to be a few micromolar, for assembly into A3B3. Nucleotide-dependent Disassembly of A3B3 Subcomplex—In the absence of nucleotides, the purified A3B3 subcomplex was stable at 4 °C for a few days (data not shown), and appeared as a single band on Native PAGE (Fig. 3A, lane 1) and eluted as a single peak in gel-permeation chromatography (Fig. 3B). However, when A3B3 was incubated with ATP, a band representing the A3B3 subcomplex disappeared and a new band appeared on Native PAGE (Fig. 3A, lane 2). Gel-permeation chromatography also showed disappearance of A3B3 and emergence of a 115-kDa complex (Fig. 3B). This indicates that ATP induced disassembly of the A3B3 subcomplex into A1B1 heterodimer. Disassembly of A3B3 was also observed when incubated with AMP-PNP or ADP (Fig. 3, A, lanes 3 and 4, and B), except that a trace amount of A3B3 was still present after treatment with ADP. Although A3B3 was completely disassembled by ATP under the conditions shown in the figure, a substantial amount of A3B3 remained after treatment with ATP when the concentration of A3B3 was much higher (data not shown). This apparent resistance of A3B3 to nucleotides might be caused by reassembly of A1B1 to form A3B3. Because the amount of assembled A3B3 is highly dependent on the concentration of the components (Fig. 2D), it does not appear that reassembly occurs at low concentrations. It is not clear why dissociation of A3B3 complex by addition of ATP yielded only trace amounts of the monomers (Fig. 3B), whereas addition of ATP to the monomeric A and B subunits gave a substantial amount of monomers (Fig. 2C). One possible reason for this inconsistency is that the isolated subunits used for assembly experiments contain inactive species that are partially denatured and cannot assemble. In contrast to the A3B3 subcomplex, nucleotide-induced disassembly was not observed for V1 complex (data not shown). The presence of the central stalk must prevent nucleotide-induced conformational changes that lead to disassembly of the A3B3 ring. Asymmetric Binding of the A Subunit with B Subunits—In the V1 complex, one A subunit interacts with two B subunits, and vice versa, because the A and B subunits are arranged alternately (Fig. 4A). One of the two interfaces between A and B subunits includes a catalytic site, whereas the other does not. Thus, two A1B1 species might exist, i.e. A-B and B-A. To determine whether A1B1 assembled from the A and B monomers contains one or two A1B1 complexes, we tried to estimate the relative distance between two positions within the A1B1 subcomplex using FRET. FRET is a powerful tool for estimating distances within the complex and for investigating dynamics of various biological processes, including protein interaction and ligand binding (30Lakowicz R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy, 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). Glu114 or Glu374 of the A subunit, and Thr107 or Lys304 of the B subunit were replaced by cysteine, and the intrinsic cysteine residues were replaced by substitution. Glu114 of the A subunit and Lys304 of the B subunit are close to the catalytic site, whereas Glu374 of the A subunit and Thr107 of the B subunit are distant from the catalytic site (Fig. 4A). These unique cysteine residues were selectively labeled by Cy3 (A subunit) or Cy5 (B subunit) dyes. If the distance between Cy3 (donor) and Cy5 (acceptor) dyes are close enough, decrease in the donor fluorescent intensity and increase in the acceptor fluorescent intensity associated with interaction of the Cy3-labeled A and the Cy5-labeled B subunits was expected. First, we examined whether FRET is observed between the Cy3-labeled A and the Cy5-labeled B subunits. Donor intensity from the Cy3-labeled A subunit did not change upon addition of Cy5-labeled B subunit to a solution containing Cy3-labeled A subunit. However, when ATP was added to the mixture of Cy3-labeled A and Cy5-labeled B subunits, the donor intensity decreased gradually (Fig. 4B). This is consistent with the result of Native PAGE and gel-permeation analyses, which indicate that the A and B subunits assemble in an ATP-dependent manner. In the absence of the B subunit, donor intensity from Cy3-labeled A subunit also decreased upon addition of ATP, but very rapidly (within a minute) and to a much smaller (about 5% for 1 mm ATP) extent (data not shown). Thus, the decrease in donor emission most likely reflects interaction between A and B subunits. Because the amount of A3B3 assembled from low concentrations of the A and B subunits is quite low (Fig. 2D), the fluorescence change noted above must reflect formation of the A1B1 heterodimer, not the A3B3, under the conditions of this experiment. Next, we measured the fluorescence spectrum of a mixture of the Cy3-labeled A subunit and the Cy5-labeled B subunit at 0 and 60 min after addition of ATP. Fig. 4C shows four sets (A114C-Cy3 and B107C-Cy5, A114C-Cy3 and B304C-Cy5, A374C-Cy3 and B107C-Cy5, and A374C-Cy3 and B304C-Cy5) of fluorescence spectra. The highest FRET indu"

To further define transmembrane 2 (M2) structure relative to NCA action, we extended the Cys scanning to the extra cellular half of the β3 homopentamer (11′ to 20′). Spontaneous disulfides formed with T13′C, L18′C, and E20′C from M2/M2 cross-linking and with I14′C (weak), H17′C, and R19′Con bridging M2/M3 intersubunits, based on single (M2 Cys only) and dual (M2 Cys plus M3 C289S) mutations. Induced disulfides also formed with T16′C, but there were few or none with M11′C, T12′C, and N15′C. These findings show conformational flexibility/mobility in the M2 extracellular half 17′ to 20′ region interpreted as a deformed β-like conformation in the open channel. The NCA radioligands used were [3H]1-(4-ethynylphenyl)-4-n-propyl-2,6,7-trioxabicyclo[2.2.2]octane ([3H]EBOB) and [3H]3,3-bis-trifluoromethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,2-dicarbonitrile with essentially the same results. NCA binding was disrupted by individual Cys substitutions at 13′,14′,16′,17′, and 19′. The inactivity of T13′C/T13′S may have been due to disturbance of the channel gate; I14′S and T16′S showed much better binding activity than their Cys counterparts, and the low activities of H17′C and R19′C were reversed by dithiothreitol. Zn2+ potency for inhibition of [3H]EBOB binding was lowered 346-fold by the mutation H17′A. We propose that NCAs enter their binding site both directly, through the channel pore, and indirectly, through the water cavity of adjacent subunits."
