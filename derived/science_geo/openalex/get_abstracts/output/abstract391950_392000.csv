https://openalex.org/W2050690313,"Regulation of chromatin structure involves histone posttranslational modifications that can modulate intrinsic properties of the chromatin fiber to change the chromatin state. We used chemically defined nucleosome arrays to demonstrate that H2B ubiquitylation (uH2B), a modification associated with transcription, interferes with chromatin compaction and leads to an open and biochemically accessible fiber conformation. Notably, these effects were specific for ubiquitin, as compaction of chromatin modified with a similar ubiquitin-sized protein, Hub1, was only weakly affected. Applying a fluorescence-based method, we found that uH2B acts through a mechanism distinct from H4 tail acetylation, a modification known to disrupt chromatin folding. Finally, incorporation of both uH2B and acetylated H4 resulted in synergistic inhibition of higher-order chromatin structure formation, possibly a result of their distinct modes of action."
https://openalex.org/W2037657244,"Activation of Nrf2 by covalent modifications that release it from its inhibitor protein Keap1 has been extensively documented. In contrast, covalent modifications that may regulate its action after its release from Keap1 have received little attention. Here we show that CREB-binding protein induced acetylation of Nrf2, increased binding of Nrf2 to its cognate response element in a target gene promoter, and increased Nrf2-dependent transcription from target gene promoters. Heterologous sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) decreased acetylation of Nrf2 as well as Nrf2-dependent gene transcription, and its effects were overridden by dominant negative SIRT1 (SIRT1-H355A). The SIRT1-selective inhibitors EX-527 and nicotinamide stimulated Nrf2-dependent gene transcription, whereas resveratrol, a putative activator of SIRT1, was inhibitory, mimicking the effect of SIRT1. Mutating lysine to alanine or to arginine at Lys(588) and Lys(591) of Nrf2 resulted in decreased Nrf2-dependent gene transcription and abrogated the transcription-activating effect of CREB-binding protein. Furthermore, SIRT1 had no effect on transcription induced by these mutants, indicating that these sites are acetylation sites. Microscope imaging of GFP-Nrf2 in HepG2 cells as well as immunoblotting for Nrf2 showed that acetylation conditions resulted in increased nuclear localization of Nrf2, whereas deacetylation conditions enhanced its cytoplasmic rather than its nuclear localization. We posit that Nrf2 in the nucleus undergoes acetylation, resulting in binding, with basic-region leucine zipper protein(s), to the antioxidant response element and consequently in gene transcription, whereas deacetylation disengages it from the antioxidant response element, thereby resulting in transcriptional termination and subsequently in its nuclear export."
https://openalex.org/W2008952784,"The mechanism of action of clofazimine (CFZ), an antimycobacterial drug with a long history, is not well understood. The present study describes a redox cycling pathway that involves the enzymatic reduction of CFZ by NDH-2, the primary respiratory chain NADH:quinone oxidoreductase of mycobacteria and nonenzymatic oxidation of reduced CFZ by O(2) yielding CFZ and reactive oxygen species (ROS). This pathway was demonstrated using isolated membranes and purified recombinant NDH-2. The reduction and oxidation of CFZ was measured spectrally, and the production of ROS was measured using a coupled assay system with Amplex Red. Supporting the ROS-based killing mechanism, bacteria grown in the presence of antioxidants are more resistant to CFZ. CFZ-mediated increase in NADH oxidation and ROS production were not observed in membranes from three different Gram-negative bacteria but was observed in Staphylococcus aureus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is consistent with the known antimicrobial specificity of CFZ. A more soluble analog of CFZ, KS6, was synthesized and was shown to have the same activities as CFZ. These studies describe a pathway for a continuous and high rate of reactive oxygen species production in Mycobacterium smegmatis treated with CFZ and a CFZ analog as well as evidence that cell death produced by these agents are related to the production of these radical species."

https://openalex.org/W2152856096,"The Sotos syndrome gene product, NSD1, is a SET domain histone methyltransferase that primarily dimethylates nucleosomal histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36). To date, the intrinsic properties of NSD1 that determine its nucleosomal substrate selectivity and dimethyl H3K36 product specificity remain unknown. The 1.7 Å structure of the catalytic domain of NSD1 presented here shows that a regulatory loop adopts a conformation that prevents free access of H3K36 to the bound <i>S</i>-adenosyl-l-methionine. Molecular dynamics simulation and computational docking revealed that this normally inhibitory loop can adopt an active conformation, allowing H3K36 access to the active site, and that the nucleosome may stabilize the active conformation of the regulatory loop. Hence, our study reveals an autoregulatory mechanism of NSD1 and provides insight into the molecular mechanism of the nucleosomal substrate selectivity of this disease-related H3K36 methyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1983275934,"Autophagy enables cells to degrade and recycle cytoplasmic materials both as a housekeeping mechanism and in response to extracellular stress such as nutrient deprivation. Recent studies indicate that autophagy also functions as a protective mechanism in response to several cancer therapy agents, making it a prospective therapeutic target. Few pharmacological inhibitors suitable for testing the therapeutic potential of autophagy inhibition in vivo are known. An automated microscopy assay was used to screen >3,500 drugs and pharmacological agents and identified one drug, verteporfin, as an inhibitor of autophagosome accumulation. Verteporfin is a benzoporphyrin derivative used in photodynamic therapy, but it inhibits autophagy without light activation. Verteporfin did not inhibit LC3/Atg8 processing or membrane recruitment in response to autophagic stimuli, but it inhibited drug- and starvation-induced autophagic degradation and the sequestration of cytoplasmic materials into autophagosomes. Transient exposure to verteporfin in starvation conditions reduced cell viability whereas cells in nutrient-rich medium were unaffected by drug treatment. Analysis of structural analogs indicated that the activity of verteporfin requires the presence of a substituted cyclohexadiene at ring A of the porphyrin core but that it can tolerate a number of large substituents at rings C and D. The existence of an autophagy inhibitor among FDA-approved drugs should facilitate the investigation of the therapeutic potential of autophagy inhibition in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1967384627,"Substantial data from clinical trials and epidemiological studies show promising results for use of statins in many cancers, including mammary carcinoma. Breast tumor primarily metastasizes to bone to form osteolytic lesions, causing severe pain and pathological fracture. Here, we report that simvastatin acts as an inhibitor of osteolysis in a mouse model of breast cancer skeletal metastasis of human mammary cancer cell MDA-MB-231, which expresses the mutant p53R280K. Simvastatin and lovastatin attenuated migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 breast tumor cells in culture. Acquisition of phenotype to express the cancer stem cell marker, CD44, leads to invasive potential of the tumor cells. Interestingly, statins significantly decreased the expression of CD44 protein via a transcriptional mechanism. shRNA-mediated down-regulation of CD44 markedly reduced the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in culture. We identified that in the MDA-MB-231 cells, simvastatin elevated the levels of mutated p53R280K, which was remarkably active as a transcription factor. shRNA-derived inhibition of mutant p53R280K augmented the expression of CD44, leading to increased migration and invasion. Finally, we demonstrate an inverse correlation between expression of p53 and CD44 in the tumors of mice that received simvastatin. Our results reveal a unique function of statins, which foster enhanced expression of mutant p53R280K to prevent breast cancer cell metastasis to bone."
https://openalex.org/W1995023885,"The RASSF1A tumor suppressor protein interacts with the pro-apoptotic mammalian STE20-like kinases MST1 and MST2 and induces their autophosphorylation and activation, but the mechanism of how RASSF1A activates MST1/2 is unclear. Okadaic acid treatment and PP2A knockdown promoted MST1/2 phosphorylation. Data from dephosphorylation assays and reduced activation of MST1/2 seen after RASSF1A depletion suggest that dephosphorylation of MST1/2 on Thr-183 and Thr-180 by PP2A is prevented by RASSF1A, shifting the balance of MST1/2 to the activated autophosphorylated form. In addition to preventing dephosphorylation, RASSF1A also stabilized the MST2 protein. Through binding to MST1/2, RASSF1A supports maintenance of MST1/2 phosphorylation, promoting an active state of the MST kinases and favoring induction of apoptosis. This is one of the first examples of a tumor suppressor acting as an inhibitor of a specific dephosphorylation pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2024334150,"Pro-survival members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins restrain the pro-apoptotic activity of Bax, either directly through interactions with Bax or indirectly by sequestration of activator BH3-only proteins, or both. Mutations in Bax that promote apoptosis can provide insight into how Bax is regulated. Here, we describe crystal structures of the pro-survival proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) in complex with a 34-mer peptide from Bax that encompasses its BH3 domain. These structures reveal canonical interactions between four signature hydrophobic amino acids from the BaxBH3 domain and the BH3-binding groove of the pro-survival proteins. In both structures, Met-74 from the Bax peptide engages with the BH3-binding groove in a fifth hydrophobic interaction. Various Bax Met-74 mutants disrupt interactions between Bax and all pro-survival proteins, but these Bax mutants retain pro-apoptotic activity. Bax/Bak-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast cells reconstituted with several Bax Met-74 mutants are more sensitive to the BH3 mimetic compound ABT-737 as compared with cells expressing wild-type Bax. Furthermore, the cells expressing Bax Met-74 mutants are less viable in colony assays even in the absence of an external apoptotic stimulus. These results support a model in which direct restraint of Bax by pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins is a barrier to apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2095173724,"T cell receptor (TCR) ligation induces increased diacylglycerol and Ca2+ levels in T cells, and both secondary messengers are crucial for TCR-induced nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) and NF-κB signaling pathways. One prominent calcium-dependent enzyme involved in the regulation of NF-AT and NF-κB signaling pathways is the protein phosphatase calcineurin. However, in contrast to NF-AT, which is directly dephosphorylated by calcineurin, the molecular basis of the calcium-calcineurin dependence of the TCR-induced NF-κB activity remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that calcineurin regulates TCR-induced NF-κB activity by controlling the formation of a protein complex composed of Carma1, Bcl10, and Malt1 (CBM complex). For instance, increased calcium levels induced by ionomycin or thapsigargin augmented the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced formation of the CBM complex and activation of NF-κB, whereas removal of calcium by the calcium chelator EGTA-acetoxymethyl ester (AM) attenuated both processes. Furthermore, inhibition of the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin with the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporin A (CsA) or FK506 as well as siRNA-mediated knockdown of calcineurin A strongly affected the PMA + ionomycin- or anti-CD3 + CD28-induced CBM complex assembly. Mechanistically, the positive effect of calcineurin on the CBM complex formation seems to be linked to a dephosphorylation of Bcl10. For instance, Bcl10 was found to be hyperphosphorylated in Jurkat T cells upon treatment with CsA or EGTA-AM, and calcineurin dephosphorylated Bcl10 in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we show here that calcineurin A interacts with the CBM complex. In summary, the evidence provided here argues for a previously unanticipated role of calcineurin in CBM complex formation as a molecular basis of the inhibitory function of CsA or FK506 on TCR-induced NF-κB activity.

Diacylglycerol is crucial for the activation of members of the PKC family, with PKCϴ being the key PKC family member required for the activation of AP1, NF-AT, and NF-κB signaling pathways in T cells. The other product generated by phosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis, inositol trisphosphate, is an inducer of calcium influx into the cytoplasm of T cells by a process known as store-operated calcium entry. After an initial inositol trisphosphate-induced depletion of the calcium stored in the endoplasmic reticulum, CRAC channels at the plasma membrane are opened in a STIM-dependent fashion, leading to a more sustained calcium influx (1Oh-hora M. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2008; 20: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Calcium acts as a second messenger in the T cell necessary for the activation of several signaling molecules, including the protein kinases CaMKII and PKCα as well as the protein phosphatase calcineurin, which in turn are crucial for the activation of the transcription factors NF-AT, AP1, CREB1, and NF-κB. Especially calcineurin has been demonstrated to be crucial for the activation of the AP-1, NF-AT, and NF-κB signaling pathways (1Oh-hora M. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2008; 20: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 2Werlen G. Jacinto E. Xia Y. Karin M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3101-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 3Marienfeld R.

In contrast to the NF-AT pathway, however, which is activated due to a direct dephosphorylation of the NF-AT transcription factors by the calcium-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin, the molecular mechanisms by which calcineurin affects the NF-κB pathway is far less understood.The transcription factor NF-κB is crucial for development, survival, homoeostasis, and function of T lymphocytes. One essential step in the antigen receptor-induced NF-κB signaling pathway is the formation of the CBM complex, which is composed of Carma1, Bcl10, and Malt1 (5Thome M. Weil R. Trends Immunol. 2007; 28: 281-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Whereas Bcl10 and Malt1 interact constitutively, Carma1 is recruited to this Bcl10-Malt1 complex in an inducible manner, depending on site-specific phosphorylation of Carma1. Besides PKCϴ, which seems to be the main Carma1 kinase following TCR engagement, also HPK1 and IKK2 have been reported to phosphorylate Carma1, albeit at different serine residues (6Sommer K. Guo B.

Following CBM complex formation, Malt1 is ubiquitinated by TRAF6, and this Lys63-conjugated ubiquitin chain functions as an anchor for the recruitment of the IκB-kinase complex, which is subsequently activated by a still unknown mechanism (9Bidère N. Snow A.L. Sakai K. Zheng L. Lenardo M.J. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1666-1671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Oeckinghaus A. Wegener E. Welteke V. Ferch U. Arslan S.C. Ruland J. Scheidereit C. Krappmann D. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4634-4645Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The activated IκB-kinase complex phosphorylates IκB proteins and thereby targets these proteins for proteasomal degradation. NF-κB is subsequently liberated and translocates to the nucleus, where it supports the expression of various NF-κB target genes. Finally, TCR-induced NF-κB signaling is terminated by the phosphorylation-dependent proteasomal degradation of Carma1 and Bcl10 (5Thome M. Weil R. Trends Immunol. 2007; 28: 281-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 11Hinz M. Scheidereit C. Sci. STKE 2007. 2007; : pe19Google Scholar, 12Moreno-García M.E.

The calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin is composed of a catalytically active A subunit (CnA) of ∼61 kDa and a regulatory B subunit (CnB) of 19 kDa. In its inactive state, the active site of calcineurin is blocked by a carboxyl-terminal localized autoinhibitory domain (1Oh-hora M. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2008; 20: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 13Shibasaki F. Hallin U. Uchino H. J. Biochem. 2002; 131: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). For its activation, calcineurin requires the binding of the CnB subunit as well as the calcium-calmodulin complex. The binding of the regulatory proteins causes a structural alteration of CnA and a release of the autoinhibitory domain. Immunosuppressive drugs like cyclosporin A (CsA) and tacrolimus (FK506) target calcineurin and impair the activation of key signaling pathways in lymphoid cells. For instance, pretreatment of T cells with pharmacological inhibitors specific for calcineurin, like CsA or FK506, led to a marked reduction of the TCR-induced NF-AT, JNK, and NF-κB activity (2Werlen G. Jacinto E. Xia Y. Karin M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3101-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 3Marienfeld R. Neumann M. Chuvpilo S. Escher C. Kneitz B. Avots A. Schimpl A. Serfling E. Eur. J.

However, although calcineurin dependence of the TCR-induced NF-κB signaling pathway has been known for over a decade, the molecular mechanism by which this calcium-dependent protein phosphatase regulates NF-κB has not been clarified.Here, we demonstrate that calcium influx is essential for the formation of the CBM complex in activated T cells. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a crucial role of the calcium-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin for the assembly of the CBM complex and NF-κB activation. Blocking calcineurin activity with CsA or FK506 or suppression of the catalytic calcineurin A subunit by siRNA led to a drastic decrease in CBM complex formation. Moreover, calcineurin constitutively interacts with components of the CBM complex like Malt1, and inhibition of calcineurin augmented the basal Bcl10 phosphorylation in Jurkat T cells. Furthermore, basal Bcl10 phosphorylation was diminished by calcineurin coexpression in HEK293 cells. In conclusion, our data imply that calcineurin regulates the TCR-induced NF-κB signaling pathway by controlling the CBM complex assembly, most likely by the removal of inhibitory phosphate groups from the CBM complex component Bcl10.DISCUSSIONA multitude of signal transduction events are initiated upon engagement of the antigen receptors in T and B cells. One critical event during this process is the activation of the phospholipase Cγ1, which in turn hydrolyzes phosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate, leading to the activation of the Ras and PKC pathways on the one hand and to a calcium influx on the other. This calcium influx is known as store-operated calcium entry and depends on the calcium sensors of the STIM family and the CRAC calcium channels (1Oh-hora M. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2008; 20: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Several signaling pathways, including the NF-AT, AP1, and NF-κB pathways, need both signaling branches (the diacylglycerol-induced and the calcium-dependent signals) for their full activity. One essential calcium-dependent signaling protein is the protein phosphatase calcineurin, which has been shown to be crucial for the TCR-induced activation of NF-AT as well as NF-κB (1Oh-hora M. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2008; 20: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 3Marienfeld R. Neumann M. Chuvpilo S. Escher C. Kneitz B. Avots A. Schimpl A. Serfling E. Eur. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22923-22931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the NF-AT pathway, the molecular mechanism underlying the calcium-calcineurin dependence of the NF-κB pathway is less well understood. Therefore, we set out to determine the molecular mechanisms by which this calcium-dependent phosphatase affects the NF-κB signaling pathway. One essential step in the NF-κB signaling pathway initiated upon antigen-receptor triggering is the assembly of a multiprotein complex consisting of Carma1, Bcl10, and Malt1, also known as the CBM complex (21Schulze-Luehrmann J. Ghosh S. Immunity. 2006; 25: 701-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Here, we provide evidence that calcium influx is crucial for the proper formation of the CBM complex. For instance, we show that an additional calcium-influx, either induced by ionomycin or by thapsigargin treatment, augmented the PMA-induced Carma1-Bcl10 interaction distinctively (Fig. 1). By contrast, a pretreatment with the cell-permeable calcium chelator EGTA-AM attenuated the PMA- and P+I-induced NF-κB activity. In addition, the CBM complex formation but had no effect on the TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 2), thus further demonstrating the necessity of elevated cellular calcium levels for the formation of the CBM complex.An active calcineurin is composed of a catalytically active A subunit, a regulatory B subunit, and a calcium-calmodulin complex (13Shibasaki F. Hallin U. Uchino H. J. Biochem. 2002; 131: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Inhibition of calcineurin with the pharmaceutical inhibitor CsA or FK506 impairs the IKK activation and thus the IκBα degradation specifically induced by TCR engagement but not upon TNF-α stimulation (Fig. 3, A–C) (3Marienfeld R. Neumann M. Chuvpilo S. Escher C. Kneitz B. Avots A. Schimpl A. Serfling E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1601-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 4Trushin S.A. Pennington K.N. Algeciras-Schimnich A. Paya C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22923-22931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that the basis for the negative effect of these pharmaceutical calcineurin inhibitors is the attenuation of the CBM complex assembly. Pretreatment of Jurkat T cells as well as primary murine T cells with CsA strongly reduces the Bcl10-Carma1 interaction by P+I stimulation or by stimulation with agonistic anti-CD3 + CD28 antibodies (Fig. 3, D–F). Importantly, a similar reduction in Bcl10-Carma1 interaction was achieved by the combined transfection of siRNAs for CnAα and CnAβ but only very moderately by transfection of the individual CnA siRNAs (Fig. 5A). However, the degree of inhibition in the Carma1-Bcl10 interaction as well as NF-κB activation was always more pronounced by pretreatment with CsA than by siRNA-mediated suppression of CnA. The reason for the lower efficacy of the siRNA-mediated CnA suppression is not completely clear. However, one can speculate that the inhibition by CsA might be more efficient because CsA impairs the activity of all CnA isoforms, whereas a residual CnA expression remained in case of the siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments, which would allow a remaining calcineurin activity (Fig. 5C). Alternatively, the third isoform of CnA, CnAγ, might also contribute to the regulation of the CBM complex formation by calcineurin. Expression of CnAγ is thought to be restricted to the testis. However, data mining revealed that this calcineurin A isoform is also expressed in T and B lymphocytes at the RNA level (GeneATLAS).The formation of the CBM complex appears to be highly regulated by post-translational modifications, involving the phosphorylation of Carma1 and Bcl10. Carma1 phosphorylation upon TCR ligation, which can be mediated by PKCϴ, HPK1, IKK2, CaMKII, and casein kinase I, is required for CBM complex formation, and thus Carma1 phosphorylation represents mostly a positive signal (7Shinohara H.

Biol. 2004; 24: 3860-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For instance, the phosphorylation of the five serine residues (Ser134, Ser136, Ser138, Ser141, and Ser144) in the carboxyl-terminal part of Bcl10 by IKK2 has been linked to a remodeling of the Bcl10-Malt1 heterodimer, leading to resolution of CBM complex assembly (14Wegener E. Oeckinghaus A. Papadopoulou N. Lavitas L. Schmidt-Supprian M. Ferch U. Mak T.W. Ruland J. Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Mol.

Phosphorylation of Bcl10 at these carboxyl-terminal serine residues does not influence the Carma1-Bcl10 interaction directly but affects CBM complex function by altering the structure of the Malt1-Bcl10 heterodimer. The disturbed Malt1-Bcl10 interaction in turn causes a reduced recruitment of Carma1 as part of a negative feedback mechanism to terminate the TCR-induced NF-κB pathway. A similar mechanism might also underlie the positive calcineurin effect shown in the present study. Although Malt1-Bcl10 interaction remained unchanged upon calcineurin inhibition by CsA or by specific siRNAs (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 5), calcineurin might dephosphorylate Bcl10, causing an alteration of the Malt1-Bcl10 heterodimer structure and thus promoting an efficient Carma1 recruitment. Interestingly, the role of basal Bcl10 phosphorylation in unstimulated T cells or during the early phase of TCR-induced signaling has not been fully elucidated. However, a basal Bcl10 phosphorylation can be observed in Jurkat T cells as well as HEK293 cells (FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7) (20Zeng H. Di L. Fu G. Chen Y. Gao X. Xu L. Lin X. Wen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5235-5245Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that calcineurin might affect the CBM complex formation by removing one or more negatively acting phosphate groups from the Bcl10 protein is supported by the increased basal Bcl10 phosphorylation in CsA- or EGTA-treated Jurkat T cells (Fig. 6) (which suggests that calcineurin dephosphorylates Bcl10 in vivo). In addition, the decrease in Bcl10 phosphorylation in HEK293 and Jurkat T cells upon coexpression of calcineurin A or more pronounced upon coexpression of the constitutive active mutant ΔCam further supports our hypothesis. Moreover, we observed a protein-protein interaction of the calcineurin A subunit or a constitutive active deletion mutant of calcineurin Aα (ΔCam) with Malt1 or Carma1. In addition, calcineurin A forms a protein complex with the CBM complex in Jurkat T cells as demonstrated by the Malt1-calcineurin A interaction (Fig. 9D). The reason for the lack of Bcl10-CnA interaction with ectopically expressed proteins remains unclear. However, one explanation could be that Malt1 is required for a stable Bcl10-CnA interaction. Alternatively, the recently published Bcl10-calmodulin interaction might also contribute to the recruitment of calcineurin to Bcl10 (25Edin S. Oruganti S.R. Grundström C. Grundström T. Mol. Immunol. 2010; 47: 2057-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Experiments are under way in our laboratory to clarify this question.Taken together, the evidence provided in this study clearly demonstrates that calcium influx is crucial for the formation of the CBM complex during TCR-induced NF-κB activation. Furthermore, our data strongly suggest that calcineurin is one of the calcium-dependent signaling proteins involved in the assembly of the CBM complex (Fig. 10). However, calcineurin might not be the only calcium-dependent enzyme required for this process. Blocking CaMKII with the specific inhibitor KN93, for instance, had a profound effect on the PMA- and TCR-induced NF-κB activity (26Hughes K. Edin S. Antonsson A. Grundström T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36008-36013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PKCα has also been demonstrated to affect the antigen receptor-induced NF-κB activation in T cells. However, PKCα seems to modulate the TCR-induced NF-κB activity indirectly by affecting PKCϴ, the central regulator of CBM complex assembly (27Trushin S.A. Pennington K.N. Carmona E.M. Asin S. Savoy D.N. Billadeau D.D. Paya C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7068-7081Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). CaMKII, on the other hand, has been identified as both a Bcl10 and a Carma1 kinase and could participate in the control of CBM complex assembly by phosphorylating Carma1 at Ser109 (23Ishiguro K. Ando T. Goto H. Xavier R. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 2095-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28Ishiguro K. Green T. Rapley J. Wachtel H. Giallourakis C. Landry A. Cao Z. Lu N. Takafumi A. Goto H. Daly M.J. Xavier R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The reduced Carma1 phosphorylation upon EGTA-AM pretreatment would support the hypothesis of an additional calcium-dependent but CsA-insensitive effect on Carma1 phosphorylation. However, although PKCα or CaMKII might contribute to the overall calcium dependence of the TCR-induced NF-κB activation, they seem not to be negatively affected by CsA (Fig. 4). From these results, especially the calineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of Bcl10 in vitro (Fig. 8), we concluded that the positive effect of calcineurin is rather direct and does not involve the activation of other calcium-dependent signaling pathways. Although we provide evidence that CBM complex formation might be affected by the calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of Bcl10, further work is needed to clarify the exact role of calcineurin for the TCR-induced NF-κB signaling pathway. For instance, it will be necessary to identify the serine residues in Bcl10 that are dephosphorylated by calcineurin. To this end, it seems likely that one or more of the five already identified carboxyl-terminal IKK2 phosphorylation sites are targeted by calcineurin because calcineurin coexpression reverted the IKK2-mediated Bcl10 hyperphosphorylation (Fig. 7, A–C). Furthermore, the Bcl10S5A mutant is not affected by calcineurin (Fig. 7). Another question pertains to the kinases responsible for basal Bcl10 phosphorylation. IKK2 and CaMKII have been identified as Bcl10 kinases, which are responsible for Bcl10 phosphorylation upon cell activation. However, whether the basal Bcl10 phosphorylation is also conducted by these kinases or conducted by still unknown kinases needs to be clarified in future experiments. The answers to these questions will not only provide a better understanding of the regulation of the TCR-induced NF-κB signaling pathway but might also lead to the development of more specific inhibitors for the different CnA isoforms in order to avoid the toxicity of the currently used immunosuppressors CsA and FK506.

Diacylglycerol is crucial for the activation of members of the PKC family, with PKCϴ being the key PKC family member required for the activation of AP1, NF-AT, and NF-κB signaling pathways in T cells. The other product generated by phosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis, inositol trisphosphate, is an inducer of calcium influx into the cytoplasm of T cells by a process known as store-operated calcium entry. After an initial inositol trisphosphate-induced depletion of the calcium stored in the endoplasmic reticulum, CRAC channels at the plasma membrane are opened in a STIM-dependent fashion, leading to a more sustained calcium influx (1Oh-hora M. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2008; 20: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Calcium acts as a second messenger in the T cell necessary for the activation of several signaling molecules, including the protein kinases CaMKII and PKCα as well as the protein phosphatase calcineurin, which in turn are crucial for the activation of the transcription factors NF-AT, AP1, CREB1, and NF-κB. Especially calcineurin has been demonstrated to be crucial for the activation of the AP-1, NF-AT, and NF-κB signaling pathways (1Oh-hora M. Rao A. Curr. Opin.

In contrast to the NF-AT pathway, however, which is activated due to a direct dephosphorylation of the NF-AT transcription factors by the calcium-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin, the molecular mechanisms by which calcineurin affects the NF-κB pathway is far less understood.The transcription factor NF-κB is crucial for development, survival, homoeostasis, and function of T lymphocytes. One essential step in the antigen receptor-induced NF-κB signaling pathway is the formation of the CBM complex, which is composed of Carma1, Bcl10, and Malt1 (5Thome M. Weil R. Trends Immunol. 2007; 28: 281-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Whereas Bcl10 and Malt1 interact constitutively, Carma1 is recruited to this Bcl10-Malt1 complex in an inducible manner, depending on site-specific phosphorylation of Carma1. Besides PKCϴ, which seems to be the main Carma1 kinase following TCR engagement, also HPK1 and IKK2 have been reported to phosphorylate Carma1, albeit at different serine residues (6Sommer K. Guo B.

Following CBM complex formation, Malt1 is ubiquitinated by TRAF6, and this Lys63-conjugated ubiquitin chain functions as an anchor for the recruitment of the IκB-kinase complex, which is subsequently activated by a still unknown mechanism (9Bidère N.

The activated IκB-kinase complex phosphorylates IκB proteins and thereby targets these proteins for proteasomal degradation. NF-κB is subsequently liberated and translocates to the nucleus, where it supports the expression of various NF-κB target genes. Finally, TCR-induced NF-κB signaling is terminated by the phosphorylation-dependent proteasomal degradation of Carma1 and Bcl10 (5Thome M. Weil R.

PR3-ANCA-activated neutrophils participate in small-vessel vasculitis. Since NB1 lacks an intracellular domain, we characterized components of the NB1 signaling complex that are pivotal for neutrophil activation. PR3-ANCA resulted in degranulation and superoxide production in the mNB1(pos)/PR3(high) neutrophils, but not in the mNB1(neg)/PR3(low) subset, whereas MPO-ANCA and fMLP caused similar responses. The NB1 signaling complex that was precipitated from plasma membranes contained the transmembrane receptor Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) as shown by MS/MS analysis and immunoblotting. NB1 co-precipitation was less for CD11a and not detectable for CD11c. NB1 showed direct protein-protein interactions with both CD11b and CD11a by surface plasmon resonance analysis (SPR). However, when these integrins were presented as heterodimeric transmembrane proteins on transfected cells, only CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1)-transfected cells adhered to immobilized NB1 protein. This adhesion was inhibited by mAb against NB1, CD11b, and CD18. NB1, PR3, and Mac-1 were located within lipid rafts. In addition, confocal microscopy showed the strongest NB1 co-localization with CD11b and CD18 on the neutrophil. Stimulation with NB1-activating mAb triggered degranulation and superoxide production in mNB1(pos)/mPR3(high) neutrophils, and this effect was reduced using blocking antibodies to CD11b. CD11b blockade also inhibited PR3-ANCA-induced neutrophil activation, even when β2-integrin ligand-dependent signals were omitted. We establish the pivotal role of the NB1-Mac-1 receptor interaction for PR3-ANCA-mediated neutrophil activation."

The ESCRT-0 complex is composed of two subunits, Hrs and STAM, both of which can engage ubiquitinylated substrates destined for lysosomal degradation. Here, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of ESCRT-0:ubiquitin interactions using isothermal titration calorimetry and define the affinity of each ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD) within the intact ESCRT-0 complex. Our data demonstrate that ubiquitin binding is non-cooperative between the ESCRT-0 UBDs. Additionally, our findings show that the affinity of the Hrs double ubiquitin interacting motif (DUIM) for ubiquitin is more than 2-fold greater than that of UBDs found in STAM, suggesting that Hrs functions as the major ubiquitin-binding protein in ESCRT-0. In vivo, Hrs and STAM localize to endosomal membranes. To study recombinant ESCRT-0 assembly on lipid bilayers, we used atomic force microscopy. Our data show that ESCRT-0 forms mostly heterodimers and heterotetramers of Hrs and STAM when analyzed in the presence of membranes. Consistent with these findings, hydrodynamic analysis of endogenous ESCRT-0 indicates that it exists largely as a heterotetrameric complex of its two subunits. Based on these data, we present a revised model for ESCRT-0 function in cargo recruitment and concentration at the endosome."
https://openalex.org/W2118571599,"Hypoxia-inducible factor α proteins (HIF-αs) are regulated oxygen dependently and transactivate numerous genes essential for cellular adaptation to hypoxia. NEDD8, a member of the ubiquitin-like family, covalently binds to its substrate proteins, and thus, regulates their stabilities and functions. In the present study, we examined the possibility that the HIF signaling is regulated by the neddylation. HIF-1α expression and activity were inhibited by knocking down APPBP1 E1 enzyme for NEDD8 conjugation but enhanced by ectopically expressing NEDD8. HIF-1α and HIF-2α were identified to be covalently modified by NEDD8. NEDD8 stabilized HIF-1α even in normoxia and further increased its level in hypoxia, which also occurred in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein- or p53-null cell lines. The HIF-1α-stabilizing effect of NEDD8 was diminished by antioxidants and mitochondrial respiratory chain blockers. This suggests that the NEDD8 effect is concerned with reactive oxygen species driven from mitochondria rather than with the prolyl hydroxylase (PHD)/VHL-dependent oxygen-sensing system. Based on these findings, we propose that NEDD8 is an ancillary player to regulate the stability of HIF-1α. Furthermore, given the positive role played by HIF-αs in cancer promotion, the NEDD8 conjugation process could be a potential target for cancer therapy."

Here we show that the core features of the BAK-driven MOMP pathway can be reproduced in a highly simplified in vitro system consisting of recombinant human BAK lacking the carboxyl-terminal 21 residues (BAKΔC) and tBID in combination with liposomes bearing an appropriate lipid environment. Using this minimalist reconstituted system we established that tBID suffices to trigger BAKΔC membrane insertion, oligomerization, and pore formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that tBID-activated BAKΔC permeabilizes the membrane by forming structurally dynamic pores rather than a large proteinaceous channel of fixed size. We also identified two distinct roles played by mitochondrial lipids along the molecular pathway of BAKΔC-induced membrane permeabilization. First, using several independent approaches, we showed that cardiolipin directly interacts with BAKΔC, leading to a localized structural rearrangement in the protein that “primes” BAKΔC for interaction with tBID. Second, we provide evidence that selected curvature-inducing lipids present in mitochondrial membranes specifically modulate the energetic expenditure required to create the BAKΔC pore.

Here, we demonstrate that the main features of the BAK-driven MOMP pathway can be reproduced in vitro using recombinant forms of BAK and tBID together with synthetic vesicles containing a defined lipid composition. Our studies with this novel in vitro reconstituted system shed new mechanistic insight on how tBID triggers functional BAK activation as well as important information regarding the actual molecular mechanism of pore formation by BAK. Additionally, we also identified two distinct roles played by mitochondrial lipids at different steps along the membrane permeabilization process driven by BAK.

All proteins were purified from soluble fractions of bacterial extracts and were >90% pure as evaluated by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE. Except for tcBID, all proteins were purified in the complete absence of detergents during the purification procedure. HPLC-purified peptides were obtained from Abgent. Peptide sequences were: 21BIDBH3, IRNIARHLAQVGDSMDRSIPP; F-21BIDBH3, FITC-IRNIARHLAQVGDSMDRSIPP; 29BIDBH3, SESQEDIIRNIARHLAQVGDSMDRSIPPG. Mitochondria were isolated from livers of male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (18Terrones O. Antonsson B. Yamaguchi H. Wang H.G. Liu J. Lee R.M. Herrmann A. Basañez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30081-30091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Isolated mitochondria (500 μg of protein/ml) were incubated with recombinant proteins in 125 mm KCl, 5 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 25 μm EGTA, 5 mm succinate, 5 μm rotenone, and 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, for 20 min at 30 °C under constant stirring, using an Eppendorf Thermomixer (Vfinal = 100 μl). Reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatant fractions and pellet fractions were subjected to 4–20% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using anti-cytochrome c 7H8.2C-12 antibody (Pharmingen). Mitochondria were kept on ice and used within 3 h of preparation (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Unless otherwise indicated, liposomes were prepared with a lipid composition resembling that of MOM contact sites ((40 PC/35 PE/10 PI/15 CL (mol/mol)) (MOM-like liposomes) (18Terrones O. Antonsson B.

Lipid mixtures at the indicated ratios were co-dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1), and organic solvents were removed by evaporation under an argon stream followed by incubation under vacuum for 2 h. For membrane permeabilization assays, dry lipid films were resuspended in 20 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 12.5 mm ANTS, and 45 mm DPX, except in experiments corresponding to Fig. 8 where 100 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, 0.1 mm EDTA (KHE buffer) supplemented with 10 mg/ml FD-20 and FD-250 was used. Unless otherwise specified, for other assays lipid films were resuspended in KHE buffer. Multilamellar vesicles were next subjected to 5 freeze/thaw cycles. Unless otherwise specified, frozen/thawed liposomes were then extruded 10 times through two polycarbonate membranes of 0.2-μm pore size (Nucleopore, San Diego, CA) to obtain large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs). Untrapped ANTS/DPX and FD-20/FD-250 were removed by gel filtration in Sephadex G-75 and CL2B-Sepharose columns, respectively, with KHE running as elution buffer. Release of LUV-encapsulated ANTS/DPX was monitored in an 8100 Aminco-Bowman luminescence spectrometer (Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY) in a thermostatically controlled 1-cm path length cuvette with constant stirring, at 37 °C (Vfinal = 750 μl). The ANTS emission was monitored at 520 nm with the excitation wavelength set at 355 nm (slits, 4 nm). The FD-20 and FD-250 emission was monitored at 490 nm with the excitation wavelength set at 530 nm (slits, 4 nm). The extent of marker release was quantified on a percentage basis according to the equation (Fi − F0/F100 − F0) = 100, where Fi is the measured fluorescence of protein-treated LUV at time t, F0 is the initial fluorescence of the LUV suspension before protein addition, and F100 is the fluorescence value after complete disruption of LUV by the addition of C12E8 (final concentration, 0.5 mm). Unless otherwise specified, lipid concentration was 100 μm. To assess the liposome binding capacity of BAKΔC alone or combined with tBID, a low speed vesicle sedimentation approach was used followed by detection of the protein by immunoblotting. Brominated PC was employed to allow efficient pelleting of liposomes by centrifugation. BAKΔC (200 nm) with or without tBID (100 nm) was incubated with freeze/thaw vesicles (1 mm) for 20 min at 37 °C under constant stirring using an Eppenford Thermomixer (Vfinal = 100 μl). Samples were centrifuged for another 10 min at 18,000 × g, and equivalent aliquots (10 μl) were taken from supernatant (corresponding to free protein) and pellet fractions (corresponding to liposome-bound protein). Half of the volume of both fractions was then subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE on 15% Tris-glycine gels followed by protein visualization by immunoblotting using anti-BAK G23 polyclonal antibody. Western blot signals were digitalized using a Bio-Rad Fluor-S-Max Imager, and integrated densities were measured using Quantity One program (Fujifilm USA, Valhalla, NY). Linearity of the response of the film-based system under conditions used was established using a serial dilution of recombinant purified BAKΔC protein. Membrane lipid strips were purchased from Echelon Biosciences (Salt Lake City, UT). The strips were first blocked with 1% fat-free milk in PBS for 1 h and incubated for 1 more hour with BAKΔC in PBS at 37 °C. The strips were washed 3 times, 10 min each with PBS, and soaked in 1% fat-free milk in PBS with an anti-BAK polyclonal G23 antibody at 1:2000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. The strips were washed twice with PBS and soaked in 1% fat free milk in PBS with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti mouse antibody (Bio-Rad) at a 1:20,000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS 3 × 10 min at room temperature, the protein was detected by chemiluminescence. Alternatively, stock solutions of different anionic lipids were solubilized in 2:1:0.8 MeOH:CHCl3:H20, spotted onto Hybond C nitrocellulose, and allowed to dry. The nitrocellulose was then subjected to the same procedure described above to detect BAKΔC by immunoblotting, protein bands were digitalized, and integrated densities were measured using Quantity One software. No detergent was added in any of the steps described for protein-lipid overlay assays to avoid any possible detergent-induced artifactual changes in BAKΔC conformation. Gel filtration chromatography was performed in an AKTA system using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column from Amersham Biosciences equilibrated in KHE supplemented with 2% (v/v) CHAPS. The sample was applied to the column in a total volume of 0.25 ml at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min, and 1-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-BAK G23 antibody. SPR was measured with a BIAcoreTM 3000 instrument using an L1 sensor chip (BIAcore). To prepare the L1 chip with liposomes, 40 mm octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (Sigma) was injected over the surface at a flow rate of 100 μl/min for 30 s. Liposomes (2 mm final lipid concentration) were then injected at a flow rate of 2 μl/min for 3 min and 30 s. Binding analyses were performed at 25 °C in KHE (running buffer). Protein stocks were dialyzed against the running buffer and then diluted in the same buffer. Protein samples were injected over the liposome-coated chip at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The resonance units change due to buffer was subtracted from the sample signal. The L1 chip was regenerated and stripped of liposomes by injecting a 2-min pulse of 40 mm octyl β-d-glucopyranoside followed by a 2-min pulse of running buffer. BAKΔC (200 nm) was first incubated with or without LUV of the indicated lipid compositions (1 mm) for 20 min at 37 °C under constant stirring using an Eppendorf Thermomixer (Vfinal = 100 μl). Then, samples were incubated with the redox catalyst CuPhe on ice for 30 min. The CuPhe stock was 30 mm CuSO4 and 100 mm 1,10-phenanthroline in 4:1 water/ethanol and diluted 50-fold into the sample. The oxidation was quenched by adding 20 mm EDTA to chelate copper and 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide to block unreacted cysteine residues, and the samples were analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-BAK G23 antibody. Immunoprecipitations with the conformation-specific antibody Ab-1 were performed in 100-μl reactions in KHE buffer supplemented with 2% CHAPS (w/v) at 4 °C unless otherwise specified. BAKΔC and liposomes were added at concentrations of 400 nm and 1 mm, respectively. Immunoprecipitation was allowed to occur overnight on a rotator in KHE buffer. In the absence of liposomes, Triton X-100 or CHAPS were added at 0.5% (w/v) as positive and negative controls, respectively. Immunoprecipitates were collected by incubating with protein G-Sepharose for 2 h followed by centrifugation for 1 min. The pellets were washed 2 times with KHE supplemented with 0.5% CHAPS then an additional 3 times with KHE supplemented with 2% CHAPS. Immunoprecipitates were released from the beads in SDS loading buffer and analyzed by Western blotting with the BAK G23 antibody. Far-UV CD spectra were recorded at 37 °C on a Jasco J-810 spectrapolarimeter (Jasco Spectroscopic Co. Ltd., Hachioji City, Japan) equipped with a JASCO PTC-423S temperature control unit using 1-mm path length cell. Data were collected every 0.2 nm at 50 nm/min from 250 to 200 nm with a bandwidth of 2 nm, and results were averaged from 20 scans. All samples were allowed to equilibrate for 10 min before CD analysis. Each spectrum represents the average of three distinct spectral recordings. The contribution of buffer with/or without liposomes to the measured ellipticity was subtracted as the blank. All samples were allowed to equilibrate for 10 min before CD analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2084680375,"Programmed cell death of lipid-laden macrophages is a prominent feature of atherosclerotic lesions and mostly ascribed to accumulation of excess intracellular cholesterol. The present in vitro study investigated whether intracellular triacylglycerol (TG) accumulation could activate a similar apoptotic response in macrophages. To address this question, we utilized peritoneal macrophages isolated from mice lacking adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the major enzyme responsible for TG hydrolysis in multiple tissues. In Atgl(-/-) macrophages, we observed elevated levels of cytosolic Ca(2+) and reactive oxygen species, stimulated cytochrome c release, and nuclear localization of apoptosis-inducing factor. Fragmented mitochondria prior to cell death were indicative of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway being triggered as a consequence of defective lipolysis. Other typical markers of apoptosis, such as externalization of phosphatidylserine in the plasma membrane, caspase 3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, were increased in Atgl(-/-) macrophages. An artificial increase of cellular TG levels by incubating wild-type macrophages with very low density lipoprotein closely mimicked the apoptotic phenotype observed in Atgl(-/-) macrophages. Results obtained during the present study define a novel pathway linking intracellular TG accumulation to mitochondrial dysfunction and programmed cell death in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2003102209,"Inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS, NOS2) plays a prominent role in macrophage bactericidal and tumoricidal activities. A relatively large amount of NO produced via iNOS, however, also targets the macrophage itself for apoptotic cell death. To uncover the intrinsic mechanisms of iNOS regulation, we have characterized the SPRY domain- and SOCS box-containing protein 1 (SPSB1), SPSB2, and SPSB4 that interact with the N-terminal region of iNOS in a D-I-N-N-N sequence-dependent manner. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that these SPSB proteins can induce the subcellular redistribution of iNOS from dense regions to diffused expression in a SOCS box-dependent manner. In immunoprecipitation studies, both Elongin C and Cullin-5, components of the multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase, were found to bind to iNOS via SPSB1, SPSB2, or SPSB4. Consistently, iNOS was polyubiquitinated and degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner when SPSB1, SPSB2, or SPSB4 was expressed. SPSB1 and SPSB4 had a greater effect on iNOS regulation than SPSB2. The iNOS N-terminal fragment (residues 1–124 of human iNOS) could disrupt iNOS-SPSB interactions and inhibit iNOS degradation. In lipopolysaccharide-treated macrophages, this fragment attenuated iNOS ubiquitination and substantially prolonged iNOS lifetime, resulting in a corresponding increase in NO production and enhanced NO-dependent cell death. These results not only demonstrate the mechanism of SPSB-mediated iNOS degradation and the relative contributions of different SPSB proteins to iNOS regulation, but also show that iNOS levels are sophisticatedly regulated by SPSB proteins in activated macrophages to prevent overproduction of NO that could trigger detrimental effects, such as cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2049171169,"For many cell types, including pancreatic β-cells, nitric oxide is a mediator of cell death; paradoxically, nitric oxide can also activate pathways that promote the repair of cellular damage. In this report, a role for FoxO1-dependent transcriptional activation and its regulation by SIRT1 in determining the cellular response to nitric oxide is provided. In response to nitric oxide, FoxO1 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and stimulates the expression of the DNA repair gene GADD45α, resulting in FoxO1-dependent DNA repair. FoxO1-dependent gene expression appears to be regulated by the NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT1. In response to SIRT1 inhibitors, the FoxO1-dependent protective actions of nitric oxide (GADD45α expression and DNA repair) are attenuated, and FoxO1 activates a proapoptotic program that includes PUMA (p53-up-regulated mediator of apoptosis) mRNA accumulation and caspase-3 cleavage.

In addition to the inhibition of β-cell function, nitric oxide induces DNA strand breaks and oxidative DNA damage (10Delaney C.A. Green M.H. Lowe J.E. Green I.C.

The addition of a NOS inhibitor to islets pretreated for 24 h with IL-1 (without removing IL-1) results in a time-dependent recovery of insulin secretion and mitochondrial function (3Corbett J.A.

Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 3415-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The ability of β-cells to recover from cytokine- and nitric oxide-induced damage is temporally limited. Following a 36-h exposure to IL-1, β-cells are no longer capable of recovering metabolic and secretory function, and the islets are committed to death (14Hughes K.J. Chambers K.T. Meares G.P.

This dichotomy in the type of cell death that has been observed appears to reflect the temporal changes in the metabolic responses and the extent of DNA damage caused by nitric oxide. Following short exposures to cytokines, under conditions in which nitric oxide-mediated damage is reversible, biochemical assays indicate that cell death is necrotic in nature. At points in which β-cells no longer have the capacity to recover from this damage, cytokine-mediated β-cell death shifts to an apoptotic process that is associated with irreversible DNA damage and caspase activation (14Hughes K.J. Chambers K.T. Meares G.P. Corbett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 297: E1187-E1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Similar to what has been observed in β-cells, nitric oxide has been implicated in the induction of both necrosis and apoptosis of multiple cell types (27Brüne B. Antioxid.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6097-6104Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we recently observed that the repair of nitric oxide-damaged DNA in β-cells occurs by a p53-independent but GADD45α-dependent process (32Hughes K.J. Meares G.P. Chambers K.T. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 27402-27408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A number of studies have shown that GADD45α expression is regulated by p53 (33Carrier F. Smith M.L. Bae I. Kilpatrick K.E. Lansing T.J. Chen C.Y. Engelstein M. Friend S.H. Henner W.D. Gilmer T.M. et al.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32672-32677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that there is an alternative pathway because p53 knockdown does not modify GADD45α expression or GADD45α-dependent DNA repair in β-cells. Members of the Forkhead family of transcription factors are known to regulate genes involved in cell cycle, stress resistance, DNA repair, and apoptosis (34Giannakou M.E. Partridge L. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 408-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 35Huang H. Tindall D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2479-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). FoxO1 is one member of this family whose activity is regulated by various external stimuli, including insulin, growth factors, and oxidative stress (36Frescas D. Valenti L. Accili D. J. Biol.

These stimuli can regulate FoxO1 activity by modifying its subcellular localization (cytoplasmic versus nuclear) and posttranslational modifications (37Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P.

In response to insulin signaling, Akt phosphorylates FoxO1, resulting in its binding to 14-3-3 and sequestration in the cytoplasm where it is inactive (37Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z.

In contrast, stresses such as nutrient deprivation attenuate Akt-mediated phosphorylation and result in the nuclear translocation of FoxO1 (37Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S.

Once in the nucleus, the activity of FoxO1 is controlled by acetylation via the histone acetyltransferase p300/CBP and deacetylation by the NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 (39Brunet A. Sweeney L.B.

Nuclear deacetylated FoxO1 promotes the transcription of genes involved in DNA repair and stress resistance, whereas acetylated FoxO1 promotes the expression of genes involved in apoptosis (39Brunet A. Sweeney L.B. Sturgill J.F. Chua K.F. Greer P.L. Lin Y. Tran H. Ross S.E. Mostoslavsky R. Cohen H.Y. Hu L.S. Cheng H.L. Jedrychowski M.P. Gygi S.P. Sinclair D.A. Alt F.W. Greenberg M.E.

Recently, evidence has suggested that acetylation may also direct nuclear localization of FoxO1 independent of phosphorylation (38Qiang L. Banks A.S. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27396-27401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In this study we provide evidence that FoxO1 and its regulation by SIRT1 play primary roles in regulating the cellular responses to nitric oxide. Nitric oxide, produced in response to IL-1, or supplied exogenously, stimulates the nuclear localization of FoxO1 and the FoxO1-dependent expression of GADD45α and repair of nitric oxide-damaged DNA in β-cells. This protective response is controlled by the activity of SIRT1. Activators of SIRT1 accelerate, whereas inhibitors attenuate, the repair of nitric oxide-damaged DNA. Further, inhibition of SIRT1 is associated with the induction of apoptosis that is characterized by enhanced expression of the proapoptotic gene p53-up-regulated mediator of apoptosis (PUMA) 2The abbreviations used are: PUMAp53-up-regulated mediator of apoptosisDEANO(Z)-1-(N,N-diethylamino)diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolateNMMAl-NG-monomethyl arginineTSAtrichostatin AAMPKAMP-activated protein kinase. and caspase activation. These findings suggest that the fate of β-cells in response to nitric oxide is controlled by the cellular localization of FoxO1 and activity of SIRT1 to either promote a protective response or induce β-cell death by apoptosis. p53-up-regulated mediator of apoptosis (Z)-1-(N,N-diethylamino)diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate l-NG-monomethyl arginine trichostatin A AMP-activated protein kinase.

Med. 2003; 83: 3-14PubMed Google Scholar). Islets were cultured overnight in CMRL-1066 (containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 prior to experimentation. INS 832/13 cells were removed from growth flasks by treatment with 0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA for 5 min. at 37 °C, washed twice with RPMI, and plated at 200,000 cells/400 μl, unless otherwise noted. The INS 832/13 cells used in this study were glucose responsive for insulin secretion (data not shown). Cells were lysed in Laemmli buffer and proteins separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane under semidry transfer conditions as described previously (43Heitmeier M.R.

Blots were blocked with 5% milk in TBST for 1 h and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following dilutions for primary antibodies GADD45α (1:500), Ac-histone H3 (1:1,000), FoxO1 (1:1,000), cleaved caspase-3 (1:1,000), cleaved caspase-9 (1:1,000), or GAPDH (1:50,000) antibodies. Membranes were incubated for 1 h with HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or anti-mouse (1:7,000, 1:5,000, respectively) secondary antibodies, and antigen was detected by luminol chemiluminescence (44White B.H. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1582-1595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). INS 832/13 cells were transduced with WT-FoxO1 or Δ256-FoxO1 adenovirus constructs at 50 plaque-forming units/cell for 1 h as described previously (45Nakae J. Kitamura T. Silver D.L. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Following transduction, cells were washed three times, and experiments were started 24 h after transduction. INS 832/13 cells were seeded in chamber slides (Nunc/Thermo Fisher) and incubated for 24 h. Cells were then transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol for a surface area of 0.3 cm2. Briefly, cells were transfected with 200 ng of GFP-FoxO1 (Addgene plasmid 17551) (36Frescas D. Valenti L. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20589-20595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) using 0.5 μl of Lipofectamine diluted in 50 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) per chamber. Cells were incubated for 24 h, the medium was then replaced with fresh medium, and cells were treated as described in the figure legends. Following treatments, cells were fixed gently to preserve GFP fluorescence using 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature followed by several washes with PBS. Cells were then permeabilized (0.2% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5) for 2 min at room temperature and washed with PBS. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (50 ng/ml in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were imaged using Metamorph software and a Nikon eclipse 90i at 40× magnification. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis was performed using oligo(dT) and reverse transcriptase Superscript Preamplification System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real time PCR was performed using the Light Cycler 480 (Roche Applied Science) and SYBR Green incorporation for product detection. The-fold-increase of GADD45α and PUMA are normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH as described previously (14Hughes K.J. Chambers K.T. Meares G.P. Corbett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol.

DNA damage was assessed using the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis) as described previously (10Delaney C.A. Green M.H. Lowe J.E. Green I.C.

Briefly, cells were harvested and embedded in 0.6% low melting agarose on slides precoated with 1.0% agar. Samples were then incubated in lysing solution (2.5 m NaCl, 100 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, 1% Triton X-100) overnight. Following lysis, the slides were incubated in an alkaline electrophoresis buffer (0.3 m NaOH, 1 mm EDTA, pH >13) for 40 min followed by electrophoresis at 25 volts for 20 min. Slides were washed three times in 0.4 m Tris, pH 7.5, and stained with ethidium bromide (2 μg/ml). Comet images were captured using a Nikon eclipse 90i and comets were quantified using the CASP program as the mean tail moment from 30–50 cells/condition. To isolate crude nuclei, ∼107 cells were washed with PBS (4 °C) and collected in nuclear lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA, with protease and phosphatase inhibitors). The lysate was then centrifuged at 2,700 × g for 10 min, and the nuclei-containing pellet was retained. The nuclei were washed twice in nuclear lysis buffer. The nuclei were then lysed and the proteins denatured by the addition of SDS to 1% followed by boiling for 5 min. 100 μg of the nuclear lysate was then diluted to 200 μl with PBS/0.1% BSA for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations were performed using sheep anti-mouse IgG Dynabeads (Invitrogen). The Dynabeads, 10 μl of slurry/sample, were washed twice in PBS/0.1% BSA using a magnetic particle separator. The beads were incubated with 4 μl of anti-acetylated lysine/sample in 200 μl of PBS/BSA at 4 °C with end-over-end mixing overnight. The beads were then washed twice in PBS/BSA followed by the addition of cell lysate (100 μg of protein). The beads plus lysate were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with end-over-end mixing. The beads were then washed three times with PBS/BSA. The proteins were eluted from the beads by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. siRNA transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lipofectamine (1.5 μl/well) and siRNA were diluted in OptiMem (Invitrogen) to give a final concentration of 100 nm siRNA. The diluted Lipofectamine-siRNA complex was added to each well and overlaid with 200,000 cells in 400 μl. Experiments were started 48 h following transfection. The following Silencer® Select Pre-designed siRNA for SIRT1, 5′-GAUCAAGAGAUGGUAUUUAtt-3′ and 5′-CGAUAUUGAGUAUUUUAGAtt-3′ were obtained from Ambion. The enzymatic activity of SIRT1 was evaluated using the Fluor-de-lys Sirt1 fluorometric drug discovery assay kit (Enzo Life Sciences, Plymouth Meeting, Pa). Statistical comparisons were made between groups using one-way ANOVA. Significant differences between groups (p < 0.05) were determined by Newman-Keuls post hoc analysis. Akt-mediated phosphorylation at serine residue 256 (Ser-256) retains FoxO1 in the cytoplasm and attenuates FoxO1-dependent transcription (37Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S.

Cellular stresses, including nutrient deprivation and oxidative stress, attenuate Ser-256 phosphorylation, resulting in FoxO1 translocation to the nucleus where it is transcriptionally active (36Frescas D.

Nitric oxide, produced endogenously by the inducible isoform of NOS following 12- or 24-h IL-1 treatments, attenuates Ser-256 phosphorylation of FoxO1 (Fig. 1A). The NOS inhibitor NMMA prevents the loss of Ser-256 phosphorylation of FoxO1 in response to IL-1. Kitamura et al. (41Kitamura Y.I. Kitamura T. Kruse J.P. Raum J.C. Stein R. Gu W. Accili D. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 153-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) have shown that nuclear, transcriptionally active FoxO1 is rapidly ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. Consistent with these findings, there is a significant reduction in the levels of total FoxO1 in INS 832/13 cells treated for 24 h with IL-1, and this loss of FoxO1 is prevented by NMMA (Fig. 1A). Akt-mediated Ser-256 phosphorylation of FoxO1 and Akt phosphorylation itself are reduced in INS 832/13 cells (Fig. 1B) and rat islets (Fig. 1C) treated with the nitric oxide donor DEANO. These findings indicate that nitric oxide is a mediator of the actions of IL-1 on FoxO1 activation. To confirm that the loss of Ser-256 phosphorylation in response to nitric oxide results in FoxO1 nuclear localization, cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were prepared from INS 832/13 cells treated for 1 h with DEANO. In untreated control cells FoxO1 is localized predominantly in cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. 1D). Following the 1-h treatment with the nitric oxide donor there is a shift in the localization of FoxO1 to the nucleus (Fig. 1D). As a second measure of FoxO1 translocation, a GFP-FoxO1 construct was transfected into INS 832/13 cells. Both DEANO (30, 60 min) and IL-1 (24 h) stimulate GFP-FoxO1 nuclear localization (Fig. 2). The percentage of INS 832/13 cells containing nuclear FoxO1 was 79 ± 9% at 30 min and 94 ± 3% following a 60-min incubation (B, p < 0.05). Consistent with the effects of the nitric oxide donor, IL-1 stimulates the nuclear localization of FoxO1 in 60 ± 3% of INS 832/13 cells, and this nuclear translocation is attenuated to control levels by NMMA (Fig. 2). These findings show that nitric oxide stimulates the loss of Ser-256 phosphorylation and promotes the nuclear localization of FoxO1 in β-cells. Nitric oxide is a known inducer of oxidative DNA damage (10Delaney C.A. Green M.H. Lowe J.E. Green I.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 11Eizirik D.L.

The comet assay was used to evaluate both the extent of nitric oxide-mediated DNA damage and the ability of β-cells to repair this damage (32Hughes K.J. Meares G.P. Chambers K.T. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 27402-27408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Treatment of INS 832/13 cells with DEANO for 1 h results in DNA damage as indicated by a 4-fold increase in mean tail moment (Fig. 3A). Removal of the donor by washing and continued culture for 5 h (in the absence of nitric oxide) results in the repair of this DNA damage (mean tail moment returns to control levels; Fig. 3A). The repair of nitric oxide-damaged DNA in β-cells does not require the presence of p53; however, GADD45α is required for DNA repair (32Hughes K.J. Meares G.P. Chambers K.T. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 27402-27408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because both p53 and FoxO1 participate in the transcriptional regulation of GADD45α, yet p53 is not necessary for the repair of nitric oxide-damaged DNA in β-cells, the role of FoxO1 as a regulator of GADD45α expression by β-cells was examined. INS 832/13 cells were transduced with an adenovirus expressing either a wild-type FoxO1 (WT-FoxO1) or a dominant negative FoxO1 (Δ256-FoxO1) mutant lacking the transactivating domain (45Nakae J. Kitamura T. Silver D.L. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). In cells expressing WT-FoxO1, DEANO stimulates an ∼4-fold increase in GADD45α mRNA accumulation following a 3-h incubation. There is an ∼8-fold increase in GADD45α mRNA accumulation in response to DNA repair conditions (1-h incubation with DEANO, followed by washing to remove the donor and an additional 5 h of incubation in the absence of donor; Fig. 3B). Nitric oxide-stimulated GADD45α mRNA accumulation is attenuated in INS 832/13 cells expressing the Δ256-FoxO1 mutant (Fig. 3B, gray bars). The inhibitory effects of the Δ256-FoxO1 mutant are selective because this mutant does not modify the expression of hsp70, a FoxO-independent gene whose expression is stimulated by nitric oxide (16Scarim A.L. Heitmeier M.R. Corbett J.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 5050-5057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C). In these experiments, WT-FoxO1 and Δ256-FoxO1 were expressed to similar levels (Fig. 3D). The effects of WT-FoxO1 on DEANO-induced gene expression are shown as a control for these studies because it takes into account the potential effects of the vector and the increased expression of the target protein. There were no differences in the levels of nitric oxide-induced mRNA accumulation in cells transfected with the empty vector compared with WT-FoxO1 (control data not shown). Because FoxO1 regulates nitric oxide-induced GADD45α expres"

PAI-1 specifically and rapidly inhibits uPA and tissue-type PA (tPA). Despite extensive structural/functional studies on these two reactions, the underlying structural mechanism has remained unknown due to the technical difficulties of obtaining the relevant structures. Here, we report a strategy to generate a PAI-1·uPA(S195A) Michaelis complex and present its crystal structure at 2.3-Å resolution. In this structure, the PAI-1 reactive center loop serves as a bait to attract uPA onto the top of the PAI-1 molecule. The P4-P3' residues of the reactive center loop interact extensively with the uPA catalytic site, accounting for about two-thirds of the total contact area. Besides the active site, almost all uPA exosite loops, including the 37-, 60-, 97-, 147-, and 217-loops, are involved in the interaction with PAI-1. The uPA 37-loop makes an extensive interaction with PAI-1 β-sheet B, and the 147-loop directly contacts PAI-1 β-sheet C. Both loops are important for initial Michaelis complex formation. This study lays down a foundation for understanding the specificity of PAI-1 for uPA and tPA and provides a structural basis for further functional studies."
https://openalex.org/W2038115582,"A high intrapulmonary protease burden is characteristic of cystic fibrosis (CF), and the resulting dysregulation of the protease/anti-protease balance has serious implications for inflammation in the CF lung. Because of this inflammation, micro-bleeds can occur releasing hemoglobin into the lung. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the protease-rich environment of the CF lung on human hemoglobin and to assess the proinflammatory effect of heme on CF bronchial epithelium. Here, we show that the Pseudomonas proteases (Pseudomonas elastase and alkaline protease) and the neutrophil proteases (neutrophil elastase (NE) and proteinase-3) are capable of almost complete degradation of hemoglobin in vitro but that NE is the predominant protease that cleaves hemoglobin in vivo in CF bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. One of the effects of this is the release of heme, and in this study we show that heme stimulates IL-8 and IL-10 protein production from ΔF508 CFBE41o− bronchial epithelial cells. In addition, heme-induced IL-8 expression utilizes a novel pathway involving meprin, EGF receptor, and MyD88. Meprin levels are elevated in CF cell lines and bronchial brushings, thus adding to the proinflammatory milieu. Interestingly, α1-antitrypsin, in addition to its ability to neutralize NE and protease-3, can also bind heme and neutralize heme-induced IL-8 from CFBE41o− cells.

The normal fine balance between the positive physiological function of the proteases and their deleterious effect is dysregulated in the CF lung. This results in unopposed protease activity that can cause lung damage.In the CF lung, proteases are secreted by the host and also by bacteria that colonize the lung. The host secretes serine, metallo, cysteine, and aspartyl proteases that include elastases, matrix metalloproteases, cathepsins, prolyl endopeptidases, and napsins. However, it is the elastases that are the main contributor to the total protease activity found in the CF lung. Given the abundance of neutrophils in CF, the principal lung proteases are secreted by the neutrophil. These include neutrophil elastase (NE), protease-3 (PR-3), and cathepsin G. NE is thought to contribute 90% of the CF sputum elastinolytic activity (1Rees D.D. Brain J.D. Wohl M.E. Humes J.L. Mumford R.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 283: 1201-1206PubMed Google Scholar) with PR-3 contributing 7% and the balance of activity derived from the remaining proteases. NE cleaves a broad spectrum of proteins, including immunoglobulins, plasma proteins, matrix proteins, cytokines, and protease inhibitors. In addition, NE can amplify inflammatory signaling by direct and transcriptional (2Geraghty P. Rogan M.P. Greene C.M. Boxio R.M. Poiriert T. O'Mahony M. Belaaouaj A. O'Neill S.J. Taggart C.C.

The range of bacteria that colonize the CF lung include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Burkholderia cepacia complex, and Prevotella, Veillonella, Rothia, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus species. The most common bacteria to colonize the CF lung is P. aeruginosa, which is known to secrete the metalloproteases Pseudomonas elastase (PsE), alkaline protease (APR), and the less abundant staphylolysin. It is known that PsE and APR are capable of degrading a broad range of host proteins and of modifying the physiology of the CF lung (6Alcorn J.F. Wright J.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2010; 391: 705-716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Pseudomonas like many bacteria requires iron for growth, and degradation of host iron-containing proteins is an excellent source of such iron. Both the Pseudomonas proteases PsE and APR and the host protease NE are capable of cleaving transferrin and lactoferrin (7Britigan B.E. Hayek M.B. Doebbeling B.N. Fick Jr., R.B. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 5049-5055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a recent paper by Fischer et al. (10Fischer B.M. Domowicz D.A. Zheng S. Carter J.L. McElvaney N.G. Taggart C. Lehmann J.R. Voynow J.A. Ghio A.J. Clin. Transl. Sci. 2009; 2: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) showed that NE could cleave the iron-containing protein ferritin to produce an increase in lung iron levels. In addition to free iron, bacteria also utilize heme, which can be released from hemoglobin. This is of particular significance in cystic fibrosis due to the frequent occurrence of micro-bleeds, which leads to the presence of hemoglobin at the delicate CF lung epithelia in the presence of both host and bacterial proteases.Hemoglobin is the main hemoprotein of the blood and accounts for 97% of the dry weight of the red blood cells. Hemoglobin is tetrameric, consisting of two α- and two β-globin chains (α2β2). In the center of each globin chain is a large central cavity where the heme group is bound by noncovalent forces (reviewed in Ref. 11Schechter A.N. Blood. 2008; 112: 3927-3938Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Hemoglobin when contained within the red blood cells is in the tetrameric form; however, on release it can dissociate into its dimeric form. Ferrous hemoglobin (Fe2+) may then be subject to autoxidation or by reaction with free radicals (12Balla J. Jacob H.S. Balla G. Nath K. Eaton J.W. Vercellotti G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 9285-9289Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) converted to ferric (Fe3+) hemoglobin (methemoglobin). Formation of methemoglobin can lead to subsequent heme release (12Balla J. Jacob H.S. Balla G. Nath K. Eaton J.W. Vercellotti G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 9285-9289Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In addition to heme release by oxidation of oxyhemoglobin, heme has also been shown to be released by proteolytic activity of the protease interpain from the anaerobe Prevotella, which is associated with periodontal diseases (13Byrne D.P. Wawrzonek K. Jaworska A. Birss A.J. Potempa J. Smalley J.W. Biochem. J. 2010; 425: 257-264Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To date, there are no studies on the proteolytic effect of the principal CF lung proteases PsE, APR, NE, PR-3, and cathepsin G on the structure of hemoglobin. In this work, we study the ability of these proteases to degrade hemoglobin and in addition evaluate the effect of the liberated heme on CF bronchial epithelia.Heme has been found to be an activator of G protein-coupled receptors where by it can activate neutrophil migration and reactive oxygen species production (14Porto B.N. Alves L.S. Fernández P.L. Dutra T.P. Figueiredo R.T. Graça-Souza A.V. Bozza M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24430-24436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition, in macrophages heme can induce the cytokine tumor necrosis factor α in an MyD88-, CD-14-, and TLR4-dependent manner (15Figueiredo R.T. Fernandez P.L. Mourao-Sa D.S. Porto B.N. Dutra F.F.

This is of particular interest as TLR and EGFR (3Bergin D.A. Greene C.M. Sterchi E.E. Kenna C. Geraghty P. Belaaouaj A. Belaaouaj A. Taggart C.C. O'Neill S.J. McElvaney N.G. J. Biol.

This study set out to examine the effect of the CF lung and lung proteases on hemoglobin. We further investigated the role of heme in the TLR/EGFR pathway and its effect on proinflammatory cytokine expression. Finally, we assessed the inhibitory capacity of AAT against the heme-induced effects.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have demonstrated that hemoglobin is cleaved by the Pseudomonas proteases, PsE and APR, and the neutrophil proteases, NE and PR-3, but not by cathepsin G. We also demonstrate that NE is the principal protease responsible for hemoglobin degradation in vivo. Heme was also shown to stimulate the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 utilizing a novel pathway involving MyD88, EGFR, and meprin. This study also highlights the importance of meprin in CF by showing both in vitro and in vivo that RNA and protein levels of meprin are elevated in CF. As a possible therapeutic, AAT was investigated as a binding partner and neutralizing agent of heme, and it was shown to be effective in doing so, suggesting that AAT not only has an ability to inhibit neutrophil proteases at the airway epithelial surface but also to dampen the damaging inflammatory effects of unopposed neutrophil proteases.The role of lung proteases has long been considered to have significant effects on the CF lung (28Greene C.M. McElvaney N.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2009; 158: 1048-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 29Taggart C.C. Greene C.M. Carroll T.P. O'Neill S.J. McElvaney N.G. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2005; 171: 1070-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Unopposed proteases can cause degradation of host proteins resulting in various degrees of loss of function (9Guyot N. Bergsson G. Butler M.W. Greene C.M. Weldon S. Kessler E. Levine R.L. O'Neill S.J. Taggart C.C. McElvaney N.G. Biol. Chem. 2010; 391: 705-716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Guyot N. Butler M.W. McNally P. Weldon S. Greene C.M. Levine R.L. O'Neill S.J. Taggart C.C. McElvaney N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32377-32385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) in addition to release of degradation products that can affect the inflammatory status of the lung (31Gaggar A. Jackson P.L. Noerager B.D. O'Reilly P.J. McQuaid D.B. Rowe S.M. Clancy J.P. Blalock J.E. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 5662-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We have shown for the first time that PsE and APR can degrade hemoglobin, thus extending the known mechanisms of iron/heme acquisition methods of the Pseudomonas spp. This has significance not only for CF but also in cases of Pseudomonas spp. infection associated with hemolysis.For the first time, we have also shown the effect of the neutrophil proteases on the structural integrity of hemoglobin. NE and PR-3 degrade the hemoglobin units in all forms. This extends the previous data (32Kao R.C. Wehner N.G. Skubitz K.M. Gray B.H. Hoidal J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1963-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) that showed that NE and PR-3 released protein fragments from hemoglobin using the rudimentary hemoglobin assay of Anson (33Anson M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1938; 22: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the finding that the mechanism of NE cleavage of hemoglobin is more effective that PR-3 at liberating the heme, as demonstrated by the TMB gels. When this is coupled with the finding that in vivo, in CF BAL, NE is the predominant protease responsible for hemoglobin degradation, it extends the role of NE in the cleavage of iron and heme-containing proteins. In addition to NE-mediated heme release, the neutrophil produces reactive oxygen species that causes formation of methemoglobin that can lead to subsequent heme release (12Balla J. Jacob H.S. Balla G. Nath K. Eaton J.W. Vercellotti G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 9285-9289Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). This illustrates how the neutrophil in vivo can use dual mechanisms to amplify heme-induced inflammation. The effect of the liberated heme in CF bronchial epithelia has been shown here to cause release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-10, illustrating again the neutrophil as an amplifier of inflammation.Prior to this work, the role of heme in the increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines in CF bronchial epithelial cells was unknown. The amphipathic nature of heme was once regarded as the method by which it exerted its biological effects, including its proinflammatory effects. In recent times our understanding of the heme mechanism of action has been extended significantly, and it is clear that heme may have multiple effects on CF lung epithelia. In addition to its role as a prosthetic group of many proteins and enzymes, heme is now known to act as a cellular messenger utilizing different methods of regulation. For example, heme is known to regulate its own synthesis and catabolism, and its other protean properties are reviewed by Furuyama et al. (34Furuyama K. Kaneko K. Vargas P.D. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 2007; 213: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Impressively, heme can target translation by heme-regulated inhibitor of translation that targets the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (35Kramer G. Cimadevilla J.M. Hardesty B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1976; 73: 3078-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Heme can also directly target transcription by heme binding domains on the transcriptional repressor Bach1, inhibiting its function and resulting in transcription of its regulated genes, including heme oxygenase 1 (reviewed in Ref. 34Furuyama K. Kaneko K. Vargas P.D. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 2007; 213: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Recent research has illustrated that the ever increasing roles of heme also extend to regulation of miRNA (36Faller M. Matsunaga M. Yin S. Loo J.A. Guo F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), ion channels (37Tang X.D. Xu R. Reynolds M.F. Garcia M.L. Heinemann S.H. Hoshi T. Nature. 2003; 425: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and cell surface receptors, including G protein-coupled receptors (14Porto B.N. Alves L.S. Fernández P.L. Dutra T.P.

Mourao-Sa D.S. Porto B.N. Dutra F.F. Alves L.S. Oliveira M.F. Oliveira P.L. Graça-Souza A.V. Bozza M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20221-20229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar).Given that heme-mediated IL-8 production in the macrophage has been reported to occur via TLR4, in this work we examined and found that heme-mediated IL-8 production was MyD88-dependent in CFBE41o− cells, and therefore we hypothesize that CFBE41o− cells also use TLR4. In support of this, we have previously shown that TLR4 and EGFR can co-localize on the surface of isogenic non-CF 16HBE14o− bronchial epithelial cells (3Bergin D.A. Greene C.M. Sterchi E.E. Kenna C. Geraghty P. Belaaouaj A. Belaaouaj A. Taggart C.C. O'Neill S.J. McElvaney N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31736-31744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this study, in addition to MyD88, heme-induced IL-8 was found to require EGFR and an EGFR agonist. Therefore, the dual TLR4/EGFR requirement may be due to co-localization of the receptors upon activation, similar to what is observed when bronchial epithelial cells are stimulated with NE (3Bergin D.A. Greene C.M. Sterchi E.E. Kenna C. Geraghty P. Belaaouaj A. Belaaouaj A. Taggart C.C. O'Neill S.J. McElvaney N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31736-31744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).In addition to the meprin-activated EGFR, we have also identified another possible direct method of EGFR activation. We have identified that an extracellular domain of EGFR contains a heme-binding motif and that heme and EGFR can physically interact.The importance of the role of meprin in CF is another pertinent finding of this work. Both the in vitro and in vivo data indicate that meprin is up-regulated at a gene and protein level in CF bronchial epithelium. This is of particular interest in this work as heme-mediated IL-8 was found to require meprin. Previously, NE-activated meprin was found to generate TGFα (3Bergin D.A. Greene C.M. Sterchi E.E. Kenna C. Geraghty P. Belaaouaj A. Belaaouaj A. Taggart C.C. O'Neill S.J. McElvaney N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31736-31744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar); however, here anti-TGFα-neutralizing antibodies alone did not significantly inhibit heme-induced IL-8, rather a pool of EGFR ligand antibodies was required. Thus heme-mediated meprin EGFR ligand generation shows a redundancy that was not seen in NE-mediated generation, showing that ligand generation is stimulus-specific.In the CF lung where micro-bleeds commonly occur in a protease-rich environment, it is clear that endogenous anti-heme neutralization mechanisms can be overwhelmed. In such cases, the increased heme levels can provide an iron source possibly fueling microbial growth but also, as shown by this study, stimulating proinflammatory cytokines. This study suggests that in the CF lung heme levels may act as a new proinflammatory factor. With a view to identifying a potential therapeutic to treat bleeding into the CF lung, we investigated the ability of AAT to bind and neutralize heme. In CF, the natural protease anti-protease balance is over-ridden mainly due to the massive NE burden; unopposed NE action results in epithelial surface anti-protease degradation and inactivation. It has been suggested that AAT therapy may have therapeutic benefit to patients with lung disease characterized by an increased protease burden such as CF (38McElvaney N.G. Hubbard R.C. Birrer P. Chernick M.S. Caplan D.B. Frank M.M. Crystal R.G. Lancet. 1991; 337: 392-394Abstract PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The principle behind the therapeutic benefit of AAT is by negating the effect of NE. More recently, however, AAT has been shown to have other potentially beneficial properties. In this work, we found that AAT binds heme, and given the positive charge of heme and the negative charge of AAT, this interaction is likely to be relatively stable. This observation was shown to have functional relevance by the capability of AAT to neutralize heme-induced IL-8 in CFBE41o− cells. Endogenous AAT is lost in the protease-rich environment of the CF lung where AAT is cleaved, which further potentiates the effects of heme. Thus, neutralization of heme and its proinflammatory effects represent a new property of AAT, in addition to its known anti-protease, anti-apoptotic, and immuno-modulatory effects.In this work, we focused on the effect of the liberated heme on the CF bronchial epithelial cell. To avoid the complication of the globin fragments, commercially available heme was used in the cell culture experiments. Hemoglobin is known to produce bioactive fragments preceding proteolysis reviewed by Ivanov et al. (39Ivanov V.T. Karelin A.A. Philippova M.M. Nazimov I.V. Pletnev V.Z. Biopolymers. 1997; 43: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), which are not subject to rapid host neutralization. Another area of future work is the examination of the biological effects of these globin fragments. The protease-rich environment of the CF lung doubtlessly produces a unique and diverse tissue-specific pool of bioactive fragments. Previous studies have found the hemoglobin fragment neokyotorphin in the rat lung (40Blishchenko E.Y. Mernenko O.A. Yatskin O.N. Ziganshin R.H. Philippova M.M. Karelin A.A. Ivanov V.T.

Biopolymers. 1997; 43: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Mapping the CF lung-specific pool of bioactive hemoglobin fragments presents a fascinating challenge that, in addition to the discovery of new bioactive molecules and their functions, may also provide a patient-specific biomarker pattern that could be used as a noninvasive clinical assessment technique.

The normal fine balance between the positive physiological function of the proteases and their deleterious effect is dysregulated in the CF lung. This results in unopposed protease activity that can cause lung damage.In the CF lung, proteases are secreted by the host and also by bacteria that colonize the lung. The host secretes serine, metallo, cysteine, and aspartyl proteases that include elastases, matrix metalloproteases, cathepsins, prolyl endopeptidases, and napsins. However, it is the elastases that are the main contributor to the total protease activity found in the CF lung. Given the abundance of neutrophils in CF, the principal lung proteases are secreted by the neutrophil. These include neutrophil elastase (NE), protease-3 (PR-3), and cathepsin G. NE is thought to contribute 90% of the CF sputum elastinolytic activity (1Rees D.D. Brain J.D. Wohl M.E. Humes J.L. Mumford R.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 283: 1201-1206PubMed Google Scholar) with PR-3 contributing 7% and the balance of activity derived from the remaining proteases. NE cleaves a broad spectrum of proteins, including immunoglobulins, plasma proteins, matrix proteins, cytokines, and protease inhibitors. In addition, NE can amplify inflammatory signaling by direct and transcriptional (2Geraghty P. Rogan M.P. Greene C.M. Boxio R.M. Poiriert T. O'Mahony M. Belaaouaj A. O'Neill S.J. Taggart C.C.

The range of bacteria that colonize the CF lung include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Burkholderia cepacia complex, and Prevotella, Veillonella, Rothia, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus species. The most common bacteria to colonize the CF lung is P. aeruginosa, which is known to secrete the metalloproteases Pseudomonas elastase (PsE), alkaline protease (APR), and the less abundant staphylolysin. It is known that PsE and APR are capable of degrading a broad range of host proteins and of modifying the physiology of the CF lung (6Alcorn J.F. Wright J.R. J. Biol.

Both the Pseudomonas proteases PsE and APR and the host protease NE are capable of cleaving transferrin and lactoferrin (7Britigan B.E. Hayek M.B. Doebbeling B.N. Fick Jr., R.B. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 5049-5055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a recent paper by Fischer et al. (10Fischer B.M. Domowicz D.A. Zheng S. Carter J.L. McElvaney N.G. Taggart C. Lehmann J.R. Voynow J.A. Ghio A.J. Clin. Transl. Sci. 2009; 2: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) showed that NE could cleave the iron-containing protein ferritin to produce an increase in lung iron levels. In addition to free iron, bacteria also utilize heme, which can be released from hemoglobin. This is of particular significance in cystic fibrosis due to the frequent occurrence of micro-bleeds, which leads to the presence of hemoglobin at the delicate CF lung epithelia in the presence of both host and bacterial proteases.Hemoglobin is the main hemoprotein of the blood and accounts for 97% of the dry weight of the red blood cells. Hemoglobin is tetrameric, consisting of two α- and two β-globin chains (α2β2). In the center of each globin chain is a large central cavity where the heme group is bound by noncovalent forces (reviewed in Ref. 11Schechter A.N. Blood. 2008; 112: 3927-3938Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Hemoglobin when contained within the red blood cells is in the tetrameric form; however, on release it can dissociate into its dimeric form. Ferrous hemoglobin (Fe2+) may then be subject to autoxidation or by reaction with free radicals (12Balla J. Jacob H.S. Balla G. Nath K. Eaton J.W. Vercellotti G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 9285-9289Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) converted to ferric (Fe3+) hemoglobin (methemoglobin). Formation of methemoglobin can lead to subsequent heme release (12Balla J. Jacob H.S. Balla G. Nath K. Eaton J.W. Vercellotti G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 9285-9289Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In addition to heme release by oxidation of oxyhemoglobin, heme has also been shown to be released by proteolytic activity of the protease interpain from the anaerobe Prevotella, which is associated with periodontal diseases (13Byrne D.P. Wawrzonek K. Jaworska A. Birss A.J. Potempa J. Smalley J.W. Biochem. J. 2010; 425: 257-264Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To date, there are no studies on the proteolytic effect of the principal CF lung proteases PsE, APR, NE, PR-3, and cathepsin G on the structure of hemoglobin. In this work, we study the ability of these proteases to degrade hemoglobin and in addition evaluate the effect of the liberated heme on CF bronchial epithelia.Heme has been found to be an activator of G protein-coupled receptors where by it can activate neutrophil migration and reactive oxygen species production (14Porto B.N.

In addition, in macrophages heme can induce the cytokine tumor necrosis factor α in an MyD88-, CD-14-, and TLR4-dependent manner (15Figueiredo R.T. Fernandez P.L. Mourao-Sa D.S. Porto B.N. Dutra F.F.

We developed a strategy that incorporates rapid and efficient immunoaffinity purification of Complex I followed by differential alkylation and quantitative detection using sensitive mass spectrometry techniques. This method allowed us to quantify the reversible cysteine oxidation status of 34 distinct cysteine residues out of a total 130 present in murine Complex I. Six Complex I cysteine residues were found to display an increase in oxidation relative to controls in brains from mice undergoing in vivo glutathione depletion. Three of these residues were found to reside within iron-sulfur clusters of Complex I, suggesting that their redox state may affect electron transport function."

Two interactions were identified as potential biological dimer interfaces in the crystal structure, and mutagenesis studies revealed that the biological dimer possesses a symmetrical interaction where blades II and III of molecule A interact with blades III and II of molecule B. The mutations of amino acids involved in the interaction weakened the dimer interaction of Hpx domains in solution, and incorporation of these mutations into the full-length enzyme significantly inhibited dimer-dependent functions on the cell surface, including proMMP-2 activation, collagen degradation, and invasion into the three-dimensional collagen matrix, whereas dimer-independent functions, including gelatin film degradation and two-dimensional cell migration, were not affected.

https://openalex.org/W2086853957,"The multifunctional Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) promotes vascular smooth muscle (VSMC) proliferation. However, the signaling pathways mediating CAMKII-dependent proliferative effects in vivo are poorly understood. This study tested the hypothesis that CaMKIIδ mediates neointimal proliferation after carotid artery ligation by regulating expression and activity of cell cycle regulators, particularly at the G1/S checkpoint. Data herein indicate that 14 days after carotid ligation, C57Bl/6 mice developed a marked neointima with robust CaMKII protein expression. In particular, only the CaMKII isoform δ was increased as demonstrated by quantitative RT-PCR. Genetic deletion of CaMKII δ prevented injury-induced neointimal hyperplasia and cell proliferation in the intima and media. In ligated carotids of control mice, the proliferative cell cycle markers cdk2, cyclin E, and cyclin D1 were activated. In contrast, in CaMKIIδ(-/-) mice, we detected a reduction in proliferative cell cycle regulators as well as an increase in the cell cycle inhibitor p21. This expression profile was confirmed in cultured CaMKIIδ(-/-) VSMC, in which cdk2 and cdk4 activity was decreased. Toward understanding how CAMKIIδ affects p53, a transcriptional regulator of p21, we examined p53 pathway components. Our data indicate that p53 is elevated in CAMKIIδ(-/-) VSMC, whereas phosphorylation of the p53-specific E3 ligase, Mdm2, was decreased. In conclusion, CaMKII stimulates neointima proliferation after vascular injury by regulating cell proliferation through inhibition of p21 and induction of Mdm-2-mediated degradation of p53."

The cellular receptor(s) for human PSGs remain unknown. Therefore, we conducted these studies to identify the receptor for PSG1, the highest expressed member of the family. We show that removal of cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) by enzymatic or chemical treatment of cells or competition with heparin completely inhibited binding of PSG1. In addition, PSG1 did not bind to cells lacking heparan or chondroitin sulfate on their surface, and binding was restored upon transfection with all four syndecans and glypican-1.

https://openalex.org/W2072388293,"The basement membrane protein laminin-332 (laminin-5) mediates both stable cell adhesion and rapid cell migration and thus has the potential to either restrain or promote tumor cell metastasis. The major cellular receptors for laminin-332 are integrin α3β1, which mediates rapid tumor cell migration, and integrin α6β4, which often mediates stable cell attachment. Tetraspanin protein CD151 interacts directly with both α3β1 and α6β4 integrins and with other tetraspanins, thereby promoting α3β1 and α6β4 association with tetraspanin-enriched microdomains on the cell surface. To explore the possibility of selectively modulating tumor cell responses to laminin-332, we re-expressed a series of CD151 mutants in epidermoid carcinoma cells with near total, RNAi-mediated silencing of endogenous CD151. The interactions of CD151 with its integrin partners or its interactions with other tetraspanins were selectively disrupted by specific mutations in the CD151 large extracellular loop (EC2 domain) or in intracellular CD151 palmitoylation sites, respectively. CD151-integrin association and CD151-tetraspanin association were both important for α3β1 integrin-dependent initial adhesion and rapid migration on laminin-332. Remarkably, however, only CD151-integrin association was required for stable, α6β4 integrin-dependent cell attachment on laminin-332. In addition, we found that a QRD amino acid motif in the CD151 EC2 domain, which had been thought to be crucial for CD151-integrin interaction, is not essential for CD151-integrin association or for the ability of CD151 to promote several different integrin functions. These new data suggest potential strategies for selectively modulating migratory cell responses to laminin-332, while leaving stable cell attachment on laminin-332 intact."

Recent studies indicate that the Orai3 subtype, in addition to being store-operated, is also activated in a store-independent manner by 2-aminoethyldiphenyl borate (2-APB), a small molecule with complex pharmacology. However, it is unknown whether the store-dependent and -independent activation modes of Orai3 channels operate independently or whether there is cross-talk between these activation states. Here we report that in addition to causing direct activation, 2-APB also regulates store-operated gating of Orai3 channels, causing potentiation at low doses and inhibition at high doses. Inhibition of store-operated gating by 2-APB was accompanied by the suppression of several modes of Orai3 channel regulation that depend on STIM1, suggesting that high doses of 2-APB interrupt STIM1-Orai3 coupling. Conversely, STIM1-bound Orai3 (and Orai1) channels resisted direct gating by high doses of 2-APB. The rate of direct 2-APB activation of Orai3 channels increased linearly with the degree of STIM1-Orai3 uncoupling, suggesting that 2-APB has to first disengage STIM1 before it can directly gate Orai3 channels. Collectively, our results indicate that the store-dependent and -independent modes of Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channel activation are mutually exclusive: channels bound to STIM1 resist 2-APB gating, whereas 2-APB antagonizes STIM1 gating.

This antigen, together with mucins, the major carriers of O-glycosylated tumor antigens in adenocarcinomas, are being evaluated as anti-cancer immunotherapeutic targets. In particular, the MUC6 protein, which is normally expressed only in gastric tissues, has been detected in intestinal, pulmonary, colorectal, and breast carcinomas. To develop anti-cancer vaccines based on the Tn antigen, we produced MUC6 proteins with different Tn density by using mixtures of recombinant ppGalNAc-T1, -T2, and -T7. The obtained glycoproteins were characterized and analyzed for their immunological properties, as compared with the non-glycosylated MUC6. We show that these various MUC6:Tn glycoproteins were well recognized by both MUC6 and Tn-specific antibodies. However, Tn glycosylation of the MUC6 protein strongly affected their immunogenicity by partially abrogating Th1 cell responses, and promoting IL-17 responses. Moreover, the non-glycosylated MUC6 was more efficiently presented than MUC6:Tn glycoproteins to specific T CD4(+) hybridomas, suggesting that Tn glycosylation may affect MUC6 processing or MHC binding of the processed peptides. In conclusion, our results indicate that Tn glycosylation of the MUC6 protein strongly affects its B and T cell immunogenicity, and might favor immune escape of tumor cells."

https://openalex.org/W2072830341,"Collagen XVIII is characterized by three variant N termini, an interrupted collagenous domain, and a C-terminal antiangiogenic domain known as endostatin. We studied here the roles of this collagen type and its variant isoforms in the mouse kidney. Collagen XVIII appeared to be in a polarized orientation in the tubular basement membranes (BMs), the endostatin domain embedded in the BM, and the N terminus residing at the BM-fibrillar matrix interface. In the case of the glomerular BM (GBM), collagen XVIII was expressed in different isoforms depending on the side of the GBM. The orientation appeared polarized here, too, both the endothelial promoter 1-derived short variant of collagen XVIII and the epithelial promoter 2-derived longer variants having their C-terminal endostatin domains embedded in the BM and the N termini at the respective BM-cell interfaces. In addition to loosening of the proximal tubular BM structure, the Col18a1(-/-) mice showed effacement of the glomerular podocyte foot processes, and microindentation studies showed changes in the mechanical properties of the glomeruli, the Col18a1(-/-) glomeruli being ∼30% softer than the wild-type. Analysis of promoter-specific knockouts (Col18a1(P1/P1) and Col18a1(P2/P2)) indicated that tubular BM loosening is due to a lack of the shortest isoform, whereas the glomerular podocyte effacement was due to a lack of the longer isoforms. We suggest that lack of collagen XVIII may also have disparate effects on kidney function in man, but considering the mild physiological findings in the mutant mice, such effects may manifest themselves only late in life or require other compounding molecular changes."

In Trp-58(E7) deoxy-α subunits, the indole side chain fills both the channel and the distal pocket, forming a completely closed state. The bimolecular rate constant for CO binding, k'(CO), to the open conformations of both mutant Hb subunits is ∼80-90 μm(-1) s(-1), whereas k'(CO) for the completely closed states is 1000-fold slower, ∼0.08 μm(-1) s(-1). A transient intermediate with k'(CO) ≈ 0.7 μm(-1) s(-1) is observed after photolysis of Trp-63(E7) βCO subunits and indicates that the indole ring blocks the entrance to the E7 channel, as observed in the crystal structures of Trp(E7) deoxyMb and βCO subunits. Thus, either blocking or completely filling the E7 channel dramatically slows bimolecular binding, providing strong evidence that the E7 channel is the major pathway (≥90%) for ligand entry in human hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W2006426923,"The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCB6 is a mitochondrial porphyrin transporter that activates porphyrin biosynthesis. ABCB6 lacks a canonical mitochondrial targeting sequence but reportedly traffics to other cellular compartments such as the plasma membrane. How ABCB6 reaches these destinations is unknown. In this study, we show that endogenous ABCB6 is glycosylated in multiple cell types, indicating trafficking through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and has only one atypical site for glycosylation (NXC) in its amino terminus. ABCB6 remained glycosylated when the highly conserved cysteine (Cys-8) was substituted with serine to make a consensus site, NXS. However, this substitution blocked ER exit and produced ABCB6 degradation, which was mostly reversed by the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. The amino terminus of ABCB6 has an additional highly conserved ER luminal cysteine (Cys-26). When Cys-26 was mutated alone or in combination with Cys-8, it also resulted in instability and ER retention. Further analysis revealed that these two cysteines form a disulfide bond. We discovered that other ABC transporters with an amino terminus in the ER had similarly configured conserved cysteines. This analysis led to the discovery of a disease-causing mutation in the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1)/ABCC8 from a patient with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. The mutant allele only contains a mutation in a conserved amino-terminal cysteine, producing SUR1 that fails to reach the cell surface. These results suggest that for ABC transporters the propensity to form a disulfide bond in the ER defines a unique checkpoint that determines whether a protein is ER-retained."
https://openalex.org/W2050479720,"Prolactin (PRL) is essential for normal reproduction and signals through two types of receptors, the short (PRL-RS) and long (PRL-RL) form. We have previously shown that transgenic mice expressing only PRL-RS (PRLR(-/-)RS) display abnormal follicular development and premature ovarian failure. Here, we report that MAPK, essential for normal follicular development, is critically inhibited by PRL in reproductive tissues of PRLR(-/-)RS mice. Consequently, the phosphorylation of MAPK downstream targets are also markedly inhibited by PRL without affecting immediate upstream kinases, suggesting involvement of MAPK specific phosphatase(s) in this inhibition. Similar results are obtained in a PRL-responsive ovary-derived cell line (GG-CL) that expresses only PRL-RS. However, we found the expression/activation of several known MAPK phosphatases not to be affected by PRL, suggesting a role of unidentified phosphatase(s). We detected a 27-kDa protein that binds to the intracellular domain of PRL-RS and identified it as dual specific phosphatase DUPD1. PRL does not induce expression of DUDP1 but represses its phosphorylation on Thr-155. We also show a physical association of this phosphatase with ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK. Using an in vitro phosphatase assay and overexpression studies, we established that DUPD1 is a MAPK phosphatase. Dual specific phosphatase inhibitors as well as siRNA to DUPD1, completely prevent PRL-mediated MAPK inhibition in ovarian cells. Our results strongly suggest that deactivation of MAPK by PRL/PRL-RS contributes to the severe ovarian defect in PRLR(-/-)RS mice and demonstrate the novel association of PRL-RS with DUPD1 and a role for this phosphatase in MAPK deactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1984746265,"The protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) family proteins regulates innate immune responses by controlling transcription induced by Toll-like receptor, RIG-I-like receptor signaling, and JAK/STAT pathways. Here, we show that PIASy negatively regulates type I interferon (IFN) transcription. Virus infection led to enhanced type I IFN induction in PIASy null cells, and conversely PIASy overexpression reduced IFN transcription. A mutation in the LXXLL motif of the SAP domain abolished inhibition of IFN-stimulated gene expression but did not affect virus or Toll-like receptor/RIG-I-like receptor-stimulated IFN transcription, indicating that PIASy employs distinct mechanisms to inhibit virus-induced and IFN-stimulated transcription. SUMO E3 activity was not required for PIASy inhibition of IFN transcription; however, PIASy relied on the SUMO modification mechanism to inhibit IFN transcription, because the activity of the SUMO-interacting motif was required for inhibition, and knockdown of SUMO E2 enzyme UBC9 decreased inhibitory activity of PIASy. Our results demonstrate that PIASy negatively regulates both IFN transcription and IFN-stimulated gene expression through multiple mechanisms utilizing the function of different domains."
https://openalex.org/W1993056701,"Bacterial phosphopentomutases (PPMs) are alkaline phosphatase superfamily members that interconvert α-D-ribose 5-phosphate (ribose 5-phosphate) and α-D-ribose 1-phosphate (ribose 1-phosphate). We investigated the reaction mechanism of Bacillus cereus PPM using a combination of structural and biochemical studies. Four high resolution crystal structures of B. cereus PPM revealed the active site architecture, identified binding sites for the substrate ribose 5-phosphate and the activator α-D-glucose 1,6-bisphosphate (glucose 1,6-bisphosphate), and demonstrated that glucose 1,6-bisphosphate increased phosphorylation of the active site residue Thr-85. The phosphorylation of Thr-85 was confirmed by Western and mass spectroscopic analyses. Biochemical assays identified Mn(2+)-dependent enzyme turnover and demonstrated that glucose 1,6-bisphosphate treatment increases enzyme activity. These results suggest that protein phosphorylation activates the enzyme, which supports an intermolecular transferase mechanism. We confirmed intermolecular phosphoryl transfer using an isotope relay assay in which PPM reactions containing mixtures of ribose 5-[(18)O(3)]phosphate and [U-(13)C(5)]ribose 5-phosphate were analyzed by mass spectrometry. This intermolecular phosphoryl transfer is seemingly counter to what is anticipated from phosphomutases employing a general alkaline phosphatase reaction mechanism, which are reported to catalyze intramolecular phosphoryl transfer. However, the two mechanisms may be reconciled if substrate encounters the enzyme at a different point in the catalytic cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1996346894,"The mechanism by which HIV-1-Tat protein transduction domain (TatP) enters the cell remains unclear because of an insufficient understanding of the initial kinetics of peptide entry. Here, we report the successful visualization and tracking of TatP molecular kinetics on the cell surface with 7-nm spatial precision using quantum dots. Strong cell binding was only observed with a TatP valence of ≥8, whereas monovalent TatP binding was negligible. The requirement of the cell-surface heparan sulfate (HS) chains of HS proteoglycans (HSPGs) for TatP binding and intracellular transport was demonstrated by the enzymatic removal of HS and simultaneous observation of two individual particles. Multivalent TatP induces HSPG cross-linking, recruiting activated Rac1 to adjacent lipid rafts and thereby enhancing the recruitment of TatP/HSPG to actin-associated microdomains and its internalization by macropinocytosis. These findings clarify the initial binding mechanism of TatP to the cell surface and demonstrate the importance of TatP valence for strong surface binding and signal transduction. Our data also shed light on the ability of TatP to exploit the machinery of living cells, using HSPG signaling to activate Rac1 and alter TatP mobility and internalization.

This property makes them extraordinarily good candidates for the transport of therapeutic bioactive molecules, such as proteins, DNA, RNA, or drugs, into cells. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms of TatP entry and its efficacy is particularly important (3Chauhan A. Tikoo A. Kapur A.K. Singh M. J. Control Release. 2007; 117: 148-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The pathway by which these peptides enter cells is the subject of substantial controversy (3Chauhan A. Tikoo A. Kapur A.K. Singh M. J. Control Release. 2007; 117: 148-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Biological assays have shown that TatP can enter into the cells at a relatively low concentration (∼5 nm) (1Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1988; 55: 1189-1193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2320) Google Scholar, 9Wadia J.S. Stan R.V. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar). In live cell imaging studies, photobleaching of GFP- and FITC-labeled TatP has been used to explore the mechanisms of TatP entry. The high concentrations (∼10 μm to 100 nm) of TatP used in these experiments could induce the nonspecific entry of TatP into cells, however (5Vivès E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2056) Google Scholar, 10Sandgren S. Cheng F. Belting M. J. Biol.

Moreover, because of the lack of state-of-the-art techniques for direct visualization, the initial events at the cell surface have only been predicted based on biological activities (e.g. activity of the reporter genes) or the amount of TatP inside the cells after ∼1 h of TatP exposure. For instance, in a recently published paper (13Gump J.M. June R.K. Dowdy S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 1500-1507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), TatP was shown to enter cells in both pinosomes and macropinosomes after initially binding to an unidentified, non-HSPG protein. Pinocytosis is always occurring at the cell surface, even without stimulation. Increasing the TatP concentration might accelerate this nonspecific entry and prevent the discovery of a truly specific entry pathway (13Gump J.M. June R.K. Dowdy S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 1500-1507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Thus, it is rather difficult to determine specific entry pathways using conventional live cell imaging and photobleaching fluorophores. There is still considerable controversy surrounding the validity of the data that have been obtained using such indirect measurements.

To clarify and quantify the mechanisms of TatP entry while overcoming the above-mentioned difficulties, we visualized the initial TatP molecular binding kinetics using a high speed confocal microscope and a high sensitivity camera with 7-nm spatial precision (22Watanabe T.M. Sato T. Gonda K. Higuchi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 359: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Nguyen V.T. Kamio Y. Higuchi H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4968-4979Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We used TatP labeled with quantum dots (QD), which are bright and resistant to photobleaching (24Medintz I.L. Uyeda H.T.

Notably, we confirmed that multivalent TatP-induced HSPG cross-linking activates Rac1 for TatP internalization. St-QDs and biotinylated Alexa were purchased from Invitrogen. Unless otherwise mentioned, inhibitors of cellular proteins were acquired from Sigma. The Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 was purchased from Calbiochem. mAb clone F58-10E4 (IgM class) (26David G. Bai X.M.

Heparin was purchased from Sigma. We received the vector for glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked GFP (pGFP-GPI) as a kind gift from Dr. Santos Manes (Centro Nacional de Biotechnologia/CSIC, Madrid, Spain) (27Gómez-Moutón C.

The pAcGFP1-tubulin vector was purchased from Clontech. The 11-amino acid TatP sequence was synthesized by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase synthesis. The N terminus was conjugated with FITC or biotin or left unmodified. The peptides were purified by reverse phase-HPLC to >95% purity on an acetonitrile/H2O/trifluoroacetic acid gradient and confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Toray, Osaka, Japan). The lyophilized peptides were reconstituted in distilled water to 3 mm stock concentrations. For the labeling of TatP with QDs, biotin-TatP was incubated with streptavidin (St)-QD (1 μm) at room temperature for 30 min at a TatP to St-QD molar excess of 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 16. To saturate the free Sts on the QDs, TatP-QDs were further incubated with an equal volume of 20 μm biotin at room temperature for 30 min. St-QD605s were used unless otherwise mentioned. The conjugated QDs were diluted in phenol red-free (Ph−) X-VIVO-10 buffer (X-B) (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) for 45 min before the experiments. The cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. 24 h before the start of the experiment, cells were detached and suspended at 1 × 105 cells/ml by Ph− minimal essential medium with 10% FBS. Subsequently, 100- or 30-μl aliquots were plated onto either 96- or 384-well microwell plates (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL), which were coated with 15-fold-diluted Ph− Matrigel Matrix (BD Biosciences) for 1 h and cultured overnight. One h before the microscopy experiments, the culture medium was exchanged for Ph− X-B with 2% FBS. TatP-QD molecular imaging was performed at 37 °C on the microscope. Primary cells were isolated from a healthy donor and cultured as described previously (28Suzuki Y. Rahman M. Mitsuya H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3064-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The partial depletion of cholesterol from the plasma membrane was performed by incubating the cells in 4 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBC) at 37 °C for 30 min (29Suzuki K.G. Fujiwara T.K. Sanematsu F. Iino R. Edidin M. Kusumi A. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 717-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). This treatment did not decrease the surface expression of HSPG, which was followed by F58-10E4 with flow cytometry (data not shown). Partial actin depolymerization was performed by incubating the cells in medium containing 50 nm latrunculin-B (LatB) for 10 min at 37 °C (29Suzuki K.G. Fujiwara T.K. Sanematsu F. Iino R. Edidin M. Kusumi A. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 717-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Rac1 was inhibited by treating the cells with 100 μm NSC23766 for 30 min at 37 °C. The Na+/H+ exchange and dynamin required for macropinocytosis were inhibited by treating the cells with 1 mm amiloride and 17 μm Dynasore, respectively, for 30 min at 37 °C. The optical system that was used to observe the individual particles consisted of an epifluorescence microscope (IX-71, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Nipkow lens-type confocal unit (CSU10, Yokokawa, Tokyo, Japan) and an electron multiplier type charge-coupled device camera (EM-CCD, Ixon DV887, Andor Technology, Belfast, Northern Ireland), as described previously (22Watanabe T.M. Sato T. Gonda K. Higuchi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 359: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30Watanabe T.M. Higuchi H. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 4109-4120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A ×100 objective lens (UPlanFLN, 1.30 NA, oil, Olympus) was used. A 50 × 50 μm2 area was illuminated with a green laser (532 nm wavelength, 50 milliwatts, CrystaLaser, Reno, NV). The laser-excited fluorescence was filtered with a >580 nm long pass filter to image the QDs. All images were processed with SOLIS software (Andor Technology). The position of a given QD was determined by fitting the image with two-dimensional Gaussian functions (30Watanabe T.M. Higuchi H. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 4109-4120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, immobile 8-val TatP-QDs on HeLa cells were tracked with a time resolution of 23 ms/frame; the standard deviation of the position of the QDs was 6.9 nm in the x axis and 6.5 nm in the y axis, indicating that the spatial precision for detecting TatP-QDs on HeLa cells was ∼7 nm. For dual labeling of HSPG and TatP, the cells were detached with 0.25% trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen), washed thoroughly with Ph− X-B, and cultured for 6 h in 1.5 ml of Eppendorf tubes with X-B containing 2% FBS. Cultured HeLa cells were first incubated with mAb F58-10E4 (1:200) in PBS with 2% FBS (designated as the binding buffer, binding B) followed by a secondary goat anti-mouse IgM tagged with QD705 (1:100, Sigma). QD705-labeled anti-mouse IgM was prepared with a QD705 antibody conjugate kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After labeling, the cells were incubated with 30 pm of 8-val TatP-QD525 for 10 min at room temperature and washed thoroughly with X-B. The cells were suspended at a concentration of 1 × 105 cell/ml in Ph− X-B containing 2% FBS, plated on 96-well glass bottom plates (Nalge Nunc), centrifuged at 4 °C, and then observed under the microscope. QD525 and QD705 were illuminated with a blue laser (488 nm wavelength, 40 milliwatts, Furukawa Electric, Chiba, Japan). The laser-excited fluorescence was split into two paths with a dichroic mirror (transmission/reflection at 570 nm, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and filtered with a 500–550-nm bandpass filter for QD525 and a 690–730-nm bandpass filter for QD705 (22Watanabe T.M. Sato T. Gonda K. Higuchi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 359: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Nguyen V.T. Kamio Y. Higuchi H.

Nanotechnology. 2010; 21: 185103Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Images were taken at a rate of 200 ms/frame at 37 °C on the microscope. The number of TatP-QDs bound to the cell and the dynamics of the QDs were examined by imaging at 400 and 23 ms/frame, respectively. TatP-QD cell-surface binding requires more than 10 min to plateau, so the lower rate of 400 ms/frame was used to avoid collecting unnecessarily large amounts of data (at 23 ms/frame, ∼19 gigabytes would be required to store the >198,000 pictures). When captured by the EM-CCD camera, the brightness of a single QD particle was characterized by a Gaussian distribution, with a peak at the center and a concentric drop in intensity. This unique property can be used to estimate the physical location of a single QD particle with nanometer accuracy. The positions of individual particles and their trajectories were determined with a single particle tracking plug-in for Image J (View5D, which automatically detects the positions of fluorescence-labeled particles). To investigate the dynamics of the particle, a mean square displacement (MSD) was calculated from the x-y coordinates of the position of the tracked particle, as described previously (30Watanabe T.M. Higuchi H. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 4109-4120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The MSD values were defined by Equation 1, MSD(nΔt)=1N−n∑i=1N−n[(Xi+n−Xi)2+(Yi+n+Yi)2](Eq. 1) where xi and yi give the position within frame i, and N is the total number of frames. The time between frames is Δt, and nΔt is the time interval over which the MSD is calculated. To calculate the diffusion coefficients (D) and the velocities (V), MSD values were fitted by Equation 2, MSD(Δt)=4DΔt+V2(Δt)2limt→0MSD(Δt)=4DΔt(Eq. 2) The DIC images and reconstructed three-dimensional images of live cells were collected with a Zeiss LSM 510-meta confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) with a Plan-Apochromatic 63 × 1.4 NA oil-immersion DIC objective (Carl Zeiss). Live cells were imaged at 10-s intervals at 37 °C in Ph− X-B. To generate the three-dimensional reconstructions of cells exposed to 8-val TatP-QD for 1 h, overlapping image stacks (10–15 stacks per cell; thickness of each image: 0.45 μm) were recorded with a ×2.0 scan zoom. The DIC and three-dimensional reconstructions were imaged with the Zeiss LSM Image Browser version 32. To examine the ability of TatP-QD655 of varying valences to bind the cell surface, detached HeLa cells were cultured in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes with X-B for 6 h and exposed to 5 nm of TatP-QD of various valences for 15 min, washed three times with ice-cold binding B, and kept on ice until analysis with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). HeLa cells were serum-starved for 24 h prior to the experiment and exposed to 30 pm of either 2- or 8-val-TatP. At the first indicated time point, the exposed cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed. The lysates (500 μg each) were subjected to a Rac1-GTP pulldown assay with GST-human Pak1-protein binding domain, using the active Rac1 pulldown and detection kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) and the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were loaded and blotted with anti-Rac1 mAb (1:3000) and an HRP-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1:3000). Signal was visualized with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific). To examine the cell-surface expression of HSPG, cells were detached and cultured in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes with X-B containing 2% FBS at least 6 h prior to experiments. Cells were stained with either anti-HSPG mAb (1:100) or an isotype-matched mAb followed by a FITC-conjugated secondary Abs (1:500) (Sigma). For experiments involving the enzymatic removal of the HS chains from cell-surface HSPGs by either HS lyase or Ch-ABC lyase, the cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with HS lyase (20 milliunits) or Ch-ABC lyase (0.5 unit) in HS lyase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.01% BSA, and 4 mm CaCl2) or Ch-ABC lyase buffer (3.3 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.01% BSA, 3.3 mm sodium acetate), respectively, and stained as described above. Aliquots of the enzyme-treated cells were plated and attached to 96-well glass bottom plates by centrifugation at 4 °C. The level of binding of 30 pm of 8-val TatP-QD to the HeLa cells was examined by single molecule microscopy as described above, with an acquisition rate of 200 ms/frame. To study the effect of trypsin, cells treated with 0.25% trypsin/EDTA for 8 min were cultured in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes with X-B with 2% FBS. Trypsin/EDTA-treated cells were collected at the time indicated and examined for HSPG expression or 10 nm 8-val TatP-QD binding by FACS or 30 pm of 8-val TatP-QD binding by single molecule microscopy as described above. To visualize the interactions between TatP and the cell surface, we used St-QDs coupled with biotin-TatP at a TatP/QD molar ratio of 1:1. Unless otherwise stated, all experiments were conducted with the HeLa cell line. We cultured the HeLa cells on glass-bottom plates, exposed them to either 30 or 250 pm of TatP-QDs for 30 s, and observed them under a Nipkow-type confocal microscope at a time resolution of 400 ms/frame. TatP-QD molecules that are not bound to the surface move very rapidly due to Brownian motion, and at this rate of acquisition, these particles cannot be localized in discrete spots. Only QDs that are bound to the membrane can be recognized as fluorescent spots. As shown in Fig. 1B, TatP-QDs surprisingly did not bind to the cell surface (∼100 cells examined) even after exposing the cells for about 15 min to 30 or 250 pm (data not shown) of QDs (the methods that were used to measure the QD numbers are described in the supplemental “Experimental Procedures”). This result suggests that monovalent TatP-QDs do not bind to the surface of HeLa cells at concentrations of 30 and 250 pm. The entry of TatP occurs in living cells at a concentration of ∼10 μm (5Vivès E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol.

We speculated that increasing the TatP concentration in the medium could enhance their ability to bind the cells. Using high concentrations of QDs would lead to very high background fluorescence, however. Thus, we first exposed the cells to 30 pm TatP-QDs for ∼3 min and then added unlabeled TatP at different concentrations in the medium. As shown in Fig. 1B, the addition of unlabeled TatP to the medium at concentrations up to 50 μm does not significantly enhance the ability of TatP-QDs to bind the cell surface. Similarly, when FITC-labeled TatP was used to test surface binding, very little binding was observed after 15 min of exposure, as detected by FACS (Fig. 1C, upper panel). These results further confirm that monovalent TatP has little to no capacity to bind to the surface of HeLa cells. Because each St-QD typically contains ∼7 streptavidin molecules, ∼30 biotin-TatP molecules can bind to each St-QD. We studied the effect of adding biotin-TatP to the medium. We expected that the extra biotin-TatP would bind to the free streptavidin sites on the TatP-QDs (Fig. 1D). The cells were precultured with 30 pm monovalent TatP-QDs without added biotin (see “Experimental Procedures”), and different concentrations of biotin-TatP were then added to the medium. We found that the binding of TatP-QD to the cell surface, including filopodia, continually increased until a plateau was reached after ∼5 min of biotin-TatP exposure (Fig. 1, E and F). The numbers of TatP-QD bound to the cell surface increased with increasing concentrations of biotin-TatP in the medium up to 5 μm (Fig. 1, E and G). These results suggest that the number of TatPs on the QDs could determine the capacity for cell-surface binding and that the TatPs in the medium interact with one another very little, if at all. To test whether the increase in TatP peptides per QD enhances cellular binding, we examined the cell surface association of QDs with different valences of TatP. One of the limitations of single molecule microscopy is that only a limited number of cells can be examined at once. Therefore, in addition to single molecule microscopy, we also employed FACS to analyze a larger population. We designate St-QD incubated with molar ratios of TatP/QDs of 1, 2–4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 16 as 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, 12-, and 16-valent (val) TatP-QD, respectively. Cells were incubated with these different valences of 30 pm TatP-QDs for 15 min and then placed on ice. The amount of TatP-QDs bound to the cellular surface was analyzed by FACS. As shown in Fig. 2 (A and B), the binding of TatP was found to increase as the valency increased from 4 to 8. The binding of ≥8-val TatP-QD was 15-fold higher than that of 4-val TatP-QD (Fig. 2F). At concentrations above 8-val, the binding did not further increase, as shown by both the relative mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) and the percentages of gated cells (data not shown). We studied the kinetics of 1-, 2-, 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, 12-, and 16-val TatP and found that the cell-surface binding of 30 pm 8-val TatP-QDs was more rapid than that of 30 pm 4-val TatP-QDs (Fig. 2, C–E, and supplemental Video 1). The binding velocities of 2-, 4-, 6-, 12-, and 16-val TatP relative to that of 8-val TatP (as calculated from Fig. 1) were 10.1, 14.6, 35.1, 70.2, and 68.6%, respectively (Fig. 2F). We confirmed these results by testing the binding of different TatP valences, namely mono-, 2-, and 4-val TatP, labeled with St-Alexa488 (Fig. 1C, lower panel). The 4-val but not monovalent TatP showed a significant amount of binding after 15 min of exposure, as detected by FACS (2.6 and 60.0% of cells bound mono- and 4-val-TatP+, respectively). In addition, we found that 8-val TatP-QDs bound well to primary CD4+T cells, macrophages, and B cells isolated from the peripheral blood cells of healthy donors (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that this phenomenon extends beyond HeLa cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate that increasing the TatP valency on the QDs enhances cellular binding; we found that at least bivalent TatP-QD is required to support TatP-QD cell-surface binding on living cells, and a valence ≥8 is required for rapid and efficient cell-surface binding of TatP. We next examined whether the lower concentrations of cell surface-bound 8-val TatP-QD could translocate into the cells. We examined cultured HeLa cells exposed to 3 or 30 pm of 8-val TatP-QD for a 24-h period, obtaining confocal images at 30 and 40 min and 1, 2, and 24 h (supplemental Fig. S2A). We found that when the cells were exposed to 3 or 30 pm of 8-val TatP-QD, the number of QD particles attached to the cells was limited to either ∼30 or ∼400 of 8-val QD particles/cell 10 min after the addition of TatP. As reported previously (33Ruan G. Agrawal A. Marcus A.I. Nie S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 14759-14766Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), we found that TatP-QDs started to appear"
https://openalex.org/W1984996380,"In the presence of oligomeric chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4-S), cathepsin K (catK) forms a specific complex that was shown to be the source of the major collagenolytic activity in bone osteoclasts. C4-S forms multiple contacts with amino acid residues on the backside of the catK molecule that help to facilitate complex formation. As cathepsin L does not exhibit a significant collagenase activity in the presence or in the absence of C4-S, we substituted the C4-S interacting residues in catK with those of cathepsin L. Variants revealed altered collagenolytic activities with the largest inhibitory effect shown by the hexavariant M5. None of the variants showed a reduction in their gelatinolytic and peptidolytic activities when compared with wild-type catK, indicating no structural alteration within their active sites. However, the crystal structure of the M5 variant in the presence of oligomeric C4-S revealed a different binding of chondroitin 4-sulfate. C4-S is not continuously ordered as it is in the wild-type catK·C4-S complex. The orientation and the direction of the hexasaccharide on the catK surface have changed, so that the hexasaccharide is positioned between two symmetry-related molecules. Only one M5 variant molecule of the dimer that is present in the asymmetric unit interacts with C4-S. These substitutions have changed the mode of catK binding to C4-S and, as a result, have likely affected the collagenolytic potential of the variant. The data presented here support our hypothesis that distinct catK/C4-S interactions are necessary for the collagenolytic activity of the enzyme."

During liver fibrosis, activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the major source of the type I collagen that accumulates in the damaged tissue. Expression of α1(I) and α2(I) collagen mRNA is increased 60-fold compared with quiescent stellate cells and is due predominantly to post-transcriptional message regulation. Specifically, a stem-loop structure in the 5′-untranslated region of α1(I) collagen mRNA may regulate mRNA expression in activated HSCs through its interaction with stem-loop binding proteins. The stem-loop may also be necessary for efficient production and folding of the type I collagen heterotrimer. To assess the role of the stem-loop in type I collagen expression in vivo, we generated a knock-in mouse harboring a mutation that abolished the stem-loop structure. Heterozygous and homozygous knock-in mice exhibited a normal phenotype. However, steady-state levels of α1(I) collagen mRNA decreased significantly in homozygous mutant MEFs as well as HSCs; intracellular and secreted type I collagen protein levels also decreased. Homozygous mutant mice developed less liver fibrosis.

The collagen family is a group of extracellular matrix proteins involved in a variety of biological processes, including providing structural support to connective tissue and forming the basement membrane of organs (1Aumailley M.

Acta Biomater. 2009; 5: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). Type I collagen is a heterotrimeric protein comprised of two α1(I) collagen chains and one α2(I) collagen chain, and although located on different chromosomes, these genes are coordinately regulated in a developmental, tissue-specific, and inducible manner (3Niederreither K.

The three peptide chains form a triple-helical structure, with several post-translational modifications resulting in multiple inter- and intrachain interactions, providing the protein with increased stability (5Eleftheriades E.G.

Increased expression and deposition of type I collagen are the most dramatic aspects of liver fibrosis, although expression of other collagens, including type III, is also increased (4Milani S.

Activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) 2The abbreviations used are: HSChepatic stellate cell5′ SL5′ stem-loopMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastRPAribonuclease protection assayTIMP-1tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1BDLbile duct ligation. are the major source of type I collagen in the fibrotic liver (7Friedman S.L.

Expression of type I collagen is very low in quiescent HSCs, which act as a storage site of vitamin A and regulate blood flow through the hepatic sinusoid. However, following a fibrogenic stimulus, HSCs undergo an activation process, characterized by a loss of the vitamin A stores; increased cellular proliferation, migration, and contractility; and increased synthesis of both α1(I) and α2(I) collagen mRNA and type I collagen protein (8Brenner D.A.

Type I collagen biosynthesis is a complex process that is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Many of these regulatory processes differ in the quiescent versus activated HSC phenotype. Activated HSCs show a 50–60-fold increase in α1(I) collagen mRNA expression, with a 3-fold increase in gene transcription and a 16-fold increase in mRNA stability (9Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Holcik M. Briendl M. Aliebhaber S. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5201-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like many mRNAs (10Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (11Shyu A.B. Wilkinson M.F. van Hoof A. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), the α1(I) collagen gene contains regulatory elements located within both the 3′- and 5′-UTRs, which are involved in message stability and processing (12Lindquist J.N. Marzluff W.F. Stefanovic B. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest Liver Physiol. 2000; 279: G471-G476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, an evolutionarily conserved sequence located ∼75 nucleotides downstream of the 5′ 7-methylguanine cap (involved in translation initiation (13Sachs A.B. Sarnow P. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 831-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar)) encompasses the translational start codon and is able to form a stem-loop (5′ SL) structure (this stem-loop is also found in α2(I) and α1(III) mRNA (14Yamada Y. Mudryj M. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14914-14919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Reporter gene assays revealed that the 5′ SL inhibited α1(I) collagen mRNA steady-state levels in quiescent HSCs and that mutation of the sequence resulted in increased mRNA levels; this inhibition was reduced in activated HSCs through interactions of the SL with RNA-binding proteins, indicating the SL is important in regulating α1(I) collagen mRNA expression during fibrogenesis (15Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4334-4342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Cai L. Fritz D. Stefanovic L. Stefanovic B. Expert Rev. Gastroenterol.

The type I collagen protein is also regulated at the translational and post-translational levels. Modifications such as cleavage of pro-domains, hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues in the GXY repeats of the triple-helical region (where G is glycine, and X and Y are often proline and hydroxyproline, respectively (18Forlino A. Marini J.C. Mol. Genet Metab. 2000; 71: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar)), and the formation of disulfide bonds are necessary to ensure proper folding of the constituent chains and to provide intra- and interchain stabilization interactions (6Doyle S.A. Smith B.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 71: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Transfection studies indicated that although the 5′ SL appeared to be inhibitory to translation in vitro, binding of proteins to the SL in vivo resulted in proper translation (19Stefanovic B. Brenner D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 927-933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, mutating the 5′ SL resulted in a type I collagen species that was susceptible to protease degradation; as such, it has been suggested that the 5′ SL is also important in regulating translational efficiency of the α1(I) collagen gene (19Stefanovic B. Brenner D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 927-933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Analysis of the 5′ SL of α1(I) collagen has for the most part been performed in cell culture studies using exogenous mutated mRNAs or molecular decoys. Therefore, we looked to extend the understanding of this element to a more physiologically relevant in vivo system. In this study we have generated a knock-in mouse harboring a sequence mutation in the 5′-UTR stem-loop that prevents formation of its secondary structure. Characterization of embryonic fibroblasts demonstrated that mutation of the SL resulted in decreased steady-state levels of α1(I) collagen mRNA expression and, in turn, type I collagen protein in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and in activated HSCs. Furthermore, mice homozygous for the SL mutation had decreased liver fibrosis and collagen accumulation in response to liver injury. Thus, the 5′ SL is critical in regulating expression of α1(I) collagen mRNA in MEFs and HSCs. Briefly, a 2.8-kb HindIII/HpaI restriction fragment of mouse genomic DNA clone p1a containing 2.3 kb of upstream promoter sequence, the first exon, and 300 bp of the first intron of α1(I) collagen was cloned into HindIII/HpaI sites in the pGL3 vector (Promega, Madison, WI) (supplemental Fig. S1A). A mutation in the 5′ SL was introduced by cloning a double-stranded oligonucleotide into the BstXI and XbaI sites of the pGL3 construct. This mutation changed 21 nucleotides of the 5′ end of the stem-loop, introduced an EcoRI restriction site, and eliminated binding of LARP6 (17Cai L. Fritz D. Stefanovic L. Stefanovic B. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 395 (2010): 309-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). From this clone, a NheI/StuI fragment was subcloned into the OSDupDel vector (a gift of Dr. Oliver Smithies, University of North Carolina) at NheI/ClaI (blunt) sites 5′ of the neomycin cassette. The second fragment, a 7.7-kb genomic StuI fragment of p1a containing the remaining 1.2 kb of the first intron and an additional 6.5 kb of downstream exons and introns, was cloned into SalI/NotI of the above OSDupDel vector 3′ of the neomycin cassette. The plasmid also contained an ampicillin resistance cassette for positive selection of clones and a herpesvirus thymidine kinase cassette for negative selection. TC1 ES cells (provided by Dr. Beverly Koller, University of North Carolina) derived from the 129 mouse strain were maintained on irradiated MEFs in ES medium (DMEM-high glucose containing 15% ES-qualified FBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mm l-glutamine). PmeI-linearized OSDupDel-SLMut plasmid was introduced to the ES cells by electroporation. The cells were suspended in 0.3 ml of PBS with 13 μg of plasmid DNA and pulsed in a 2-mm gap electroporation cuvette with 270 V, 50 microfarads, and 350 Ω for 0.4 s using an Electro Cell Manipulator 630 (BTX, Holliston, MA). The cells were immediately plated on neomycin-resistant, sublethally irradiated MEFs in ES medium. After 24 h, the medium was replaced, and the cells were grown in ES medium containing 200 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA); after an additional 24 h, 1 μg/ml ganciclovir was added to the medium. Individual G418/ganciclovir-resistant ES colonies were expanded and screened for proper recombination by Southern blotting. Genomic DNA was isolated by standard techniques (20Hogan B. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Plainview, NY1994: 1-487Google Scholar), digested with EcoRI, separated on a 0.8% agarose Tris acetate-EDTA gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), followed by UV-cross-linking of the blot. The blot was hybridized with two probes to ensure homologous recombination (supplemental Fig. S3). The first probe (Recomb) binds a region of endogenous genomic DNA located outside the construct DNA and was generated by RT-PCR of mouse NIH3T3 RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The primer sequences are: sense, 5′-TGCCCACCCCCACATACAGC-3′, and antisense, 5′-CACGCCACGCCACGCCACCTCATCTT-3′. The second probe (Neo) binds within the neomycin resistance cassette of the construct and was generated by PCR of OSDupDel-SLMut plasmid DNA. The primer sequences are: sense, 5′-TGACGCGTGTGGCCTCGAACAC-3′, and antisense, 5′-TGAGCCTGGC GAACAGTTCGGC-3′. The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the random primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN); each hybridization was performed by incubating 12.5 × 1012 counts of probe with the membrane for 1 h at 68 °C in Rapid-Hyb buffer (GE Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). The blot was washed once with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS; washed once with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS (each for 20 min at 55 °C); and analyzed the following day using a Typhoon 8600 PhosphorImager (GE Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, U.K.). Two positive heterozygous clones were weaned off feeder cells and expanded on 0.1% gelatin-coated culture plates in ES medium containing 1000 units/ml recombinant leukemia inhibitory factor (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) to maintain the cells in an undifferentiated state. Expanded clones were karyotyped to ensure the absence of chromosomal abnormalities. One positive undifferentiated ES clone was expanded, microinjected into blastocysts, and implanted in C57BL/6 surrogate females (Animal Models Core, University of North Carolina). Successful introduction of the ES cell DNA was determined by the appearance of chimeric offspring. Males of 70–80% chimerism were bred with wild-type C57BL/6 females. Successful integration of the mutation into the germ line was determined by the appearance of agouti (F1) offspring; genotyping by Southern blot (as described above) confirmed the mutation. F1 heterozygote males and females were intercrossed, and the resulting offspring were bred to perform MEF isolations and initial phenotyping. As before, genotyping was performed by Southern blot. All of the animal work was approved by the University's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. HSCs were isolated through collagenase-Pronase perfusion of livers, followed by 8.2% Nycodenz (Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corporation, Westbury, NY) two-layer discontinuous density gradient centrifugation resulting in 99% purity of HSCs as confirmed by retinoid autofluorescence (21Seki E.

After the isolation, HSCs were plated and cultured on plastic dishes with 10% FBS supplemented DMEM for 7 days, and then the cells were analyzed. Specific pathogen-free WT (Balb/c/J) and 5′ SL mutant mice backcrossed with Balb/c background eight times were used for this study. For the bile duct ligation (BDL) model, 8–12-week-old mice were anesthetized. After laparotomy, the common bile duct was ligated twice, and the abdomen was closed. The sham operation was performed similarly without BDL. The mice received humane care according to National Institutes of Health recommendations outlined in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All of the animal experiments were approved by the Columbia University and University of California, San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Hepatic hydroxyproline content was measured as described previously (21Seki E. De Minicis S. Osterreicher C.H. Kluwe J. Osawa Y. Brenner D.A. Schwabe R.F. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 1324-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). Hepatic collagen content was also quantitated by Sirius red staining of paraffin-embedded sections. The Sirius red-positive area was analyzed in six random fields (100×) on each slide and quantified using National Institutes of Health imaging software. MEFs were isolated by standard techniques (20Hogan B. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Plainview, NY1994: 1-487Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from MEFs using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and ribonuclease protection assays (RPAs) were performed as described previously (22Rippe R.A. Almounajed G. Brenner D.A. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 241-251PubMed Google Scholar). Antisense probes for mouse α1(I) collagen were designed by RT-PCR of NIH3T3 RNA (wild-type probe) or PCR from the OSDupDel-SLMut plasmid (mutant probe). The primer sequences are: wild type: sense, 5′-CCGCAAAGAGTCTACATGTC-3′, and antisense, 5′-ACACAGCCGTGCCATTGTGG-3′; mutant: sense, 5′-CTCGGGACGGAGCAGGAG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GAATTCTGTGTACGAGCAATTCTA-3′. Antisense probe for mouse α2(I) collagen was designed by RT-PCR of NIH3T3 RNA. The primer sequences are: sense, 5′-GGTTTCCAAGGACCTGCT-3′, and antisense, 5′-CTTTGAAGCCAGGAAGTCC-3′. The products were cloned into BlueScript SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) under the control of the T7 promoter; an antisense probe against mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (p-TRI-GAPDH; Ambion, Austin, TX) was used as a loading control. [α-32P]UTP-labeled probes were incubated with 5 μg of RNA, and the protected fragments were subjected to electrophoresis in 5% acrylamide urea sequencing gels; the gels were subsequently fixed in 10% methanol:10% acetic acid for 15 min, followed by autoradiography and quantitation on a Typhoon 8600 PhosphorImager, using 5 μg of NIH3T3 RNA as a normalization control. Whole cell protein lysate was extracted from MEFs and HSCs by a 20-min incubation at 4 °C in Dignam C buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25% glycerol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing 10 mm 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 500 μm Pefabloc, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin. The samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Protein lysate was separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE under native or denaturing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). Equal protein loading was determined by Ponceau S staining (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) of the transfer blot and by Western blot using 1:1000 goat anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or 1:1000 mouse anti-α-tubulin (Zymed Labs, San Francisco, CA) primary antibodies and 1:1000 rabbit anti-goat or goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Blotting was performed as described (23Schnabl B. Kweon Y.O. Frederick J.P. Wang X.F. Rippe R.A. Brenner D.A. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), using 1:1000 rabbit anti-collagen type I (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA), and 1:1000 goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Protein expression was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL), and expression levels were quantified by densitometry using AlphaEase software (Alpha-Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA). MEFs or HSCs were washed twice with PBS, fresh DMEM-high glucose medium containing 10% FBS was added to the cells, and aliquots were removed at the indicated time points. The aliquots were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE; blotting was performed with rabbit anti-type I collagen as described above and with 1:1000 mouse anti-fibronectin (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) with 1:1000 goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Wild-type and mutant MEFs were plated on 60-mm cell culture dishes at a density of 20 × 104 cells/dish. The cells were transduced overnight with either AdCre or Ad-Track CMV (which expresses GFP under the cytomegalovirus promoter) adenovirus in DMEM containing 2% FBS at a multiplicity of infection of 6000, which resulted in >90% transduction efficiency (data not shown). The following day, the viral medium was removed and replaced with DMEM containing 10% FBS; 36 h post-transduction, the medium was collected, and the cells were harvested for RNA (as described under “Ribonuclease Protection Assays”). Genomic DNA was isolated from additional dishes using the Puregene Cell & Tissue DNA Purification System (Gentra, Minneapolis, MN). To determine splicing efficiency of the mutant transcript, human 293A cells were transfected with 5 μg of OSDupDel-SLMut plasmid or empty vector using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA); 48 h post-transfection, cellular RNA was harvested using TRIzol, and RNA samples were reverse-transcribed, followed by PCR amplification. PCR primers were designed such that the sense primer bound to a region within the first exon of the mouse α1(I) collagen gene, whereas the antisense primer bound to a region within the second exon (supplemental Fig. S2A). The primer sequences were: sense, 5′-CTCGGGACGGAGCAGGAG-3′, and antisense, 5′-ACACAGCCGTGCCATTGTGG-3′. For confirmation of neomycin cassette removal using AdCre, 100 ng of MEF genomic DNA was amplified using primers that flanked the cassette. The primer sequences were: sense, 5′-GCAGGGTTCCTCCCAGCTCT-3′, and antisense, 5′-AGCCGGGTCCTTCAAAGCCAG-3′. Wild-type or SL mutant MEFs were treated with actinomycin D (5 ng/ml) or DMSO in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The cells were lysed at 0, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h after treatment. RNA was isolated by RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed using random hexamer primer. Real time quantitative PCR was performed with an ABI 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using an α1(I) collagen primer-probe set (Mm00801666_g1; ABI, Foster City, CA) for 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 60 s at 60 °C. Quantification was performed by comparing the Ct values of each sample to a standard curve and normalization to 18 S (primer probe set (Hs99999901_s1; ABI, Foster City, CA). Student's t test was used to determine statistical significance between groups. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. Approximately 10.5 kb of mouse genomic DNA containing the α1(I) collagen sequence, harboring a mutation in the 5′-UTR stem-loop sequence that abolished SL formation, was cloned into the OSDupDel targeting vector (supplemental Fig. S1A). Along with the 21-nucleotide mutation, an EcoRI restriction site was included, which was used for genotyping purposes (Fig. 1) but did not disrupt the translational start codon located within the loop. The short arm of the construct contained 2.8 kb of genomic DNA, incorporating 2.3 kb of upstream sequence, the first exon (including the SL mutation), and a 300-bp portion of the first intron. The long arm included the remaining 1.2 kb of the first intron and 6.5 kb of additional downstream sequence. A neomycin cassette was located between the arms and within the first intron, making the entire insert ∼12.8 kb in length. The product of a successful homologous recombination event would result in introduction of the SL mutation along with the neomycin cassette into the genome (supplemental Fig. S1B). RT-PCR was performed on 293 cells transfected with SL mutant plasmid to determine whether insertion of the mutant construct affected the capability to splice α1(I) collagen mRNA. A PCR primer set was generated such that the sense primer bound within the first exon of the message, whereas the antisense primer bound within the second exon (supplemental Fig. S2A). If proper splicing occurred, the expected PCR product would be 290 bp; however, because of the neomycin cassette within the first intron, if the message was not efficiently or properly spliced, a product of 3020 bp would be observed. As shown in supplemental Fig. S2B, only the smaller PCR product was detected in cells transfected with the SL mutant plasmid; cells transfected with the empty vector generated no product. The efficiency of production of the large PCR product was confirmed using the SL mutant plasmid as a template. The linearized targeting construct was electroporated into 129 strain embryonic stem cells, and clones were positively selected for homologous recombination and negatively selected against random integration. Individual clones were isolated and expanded, and homologous recombination was assessed using two Southern blot probes. Following EcoRI digestion of the ES DNA, the first probe (Recomb) bound to a region outside the recombined construct DNA and generated a 4.1-kb fragment if the SL mutation was properly inserted (supplemental Fig. S3B). In addition, because the neomycin cassette contained an EcoRI site, proper homologous recombination was further confirmed using a second probe (Neo), which bound the cassette downstream of the restriction site, generating a 10.3-kb fragment. Digested wild-type DNA would generate a 13.9-kb band with the Recomb probe and no band with the Neo probe. As shown in supplemental Fig. S3, several clones were positive for proper homologous recombination (see lanes 7 and 8). Positive heterozygous clones had normal chromosomal karyotypes (data not shown). Following successful generation of mice harboring the 5′ SL mutation, the mutant mice had normal development, grossly normal phenotype, and normal fertility. This was somewhat surprising, given the role of type I collagen in growth and development (see “Discussion”). RNA was harvested from MEFs isolated from wild-type and mutant mice and subjected to RPAs using α1(I) collagen-specific probes to analyze effects of the SL mutation on message expression. Two probes were designed, and both bound either genotype; however, a portion of each probe bound specifically to either wild-type or mutant sequence (Fig. 2, A and B). Digestion of the RNA-probe hybrid would thus generate protected bands of differing size depending on the genotype of the cell. The wild-type probe protected a 213-bp fragment of wild-type RNA, whereas the protected fragment of the mutant-containing RNA was 190 bp; likewise, the mutant probe protected a 91-bp fragment of mutant RNA and a 68-bp fragment of wild type. As seen in Fig. 2 (C and D), the wild-type probe protected the proper fragment for each respective genotype; similar results were obtained using the mutant probe. Quantitation of the bands revealed an ∼55% reduction in α1(I) collagen mRNA expression in mutant cells, regardless of the probe used (Fig. 2, E and F). To further investigate these findings, we isolated MEFs from heterozygous embryos and analyzed the relative contribution of the wild-type and mutant alleles to the total α1(I) collagen mRNA population (Fig. 2G, wild-type probe RPA; mutant probe RPA not shown). RPA results using either riboprobe indicated that expression of the wild-type allele was approximately twice that of the mutant, in close agreement with our findings comparing the alleles separately in homozygous MEFs. No significant difference in expression of α2(I) collagen mRNA was detected between WT and mutant MEFs (supplemental Fig. S4, A and B). Because the production and accumulation of the type I collagen heterotrimer is the end product of the pathway, we next determined what effect mutation of the stem-loop had on type I collagen protein expression. As shown in Fig. 3A, intracellular type I collagen expression was decreased ∼65% in homozygous mutant compared with wild-type MEFs. This decrease is similar to that observed in the steady-state levels of α1(I) collagen mRNA (Fig. 2), indicating that there does not appear to be increased translational activity in the mutant cells to compensate for reduced RNA levels. A similar decrease in intracellular type I pro-collagen protein was also observed under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3B), which allows for the detection of the high molecular weight, disulfide-bonded species of collagen. We next analyzed the effect of mutating the 5′ SL on collagen secretion. Collagen levels were decreased in medium harvested from mutant MEFs over a period of 3 h compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 3C). Although collagen secretion was clearly observed after 2 h in wild-type cells, expression was detected only faintly after 3 h in mutant cells and at levels much lower than wild type at either 2 or 3 h. This decrease correlated with the decreased intracellular expression of type I collagen in mutant MEFs observed in Fig. 3 (A and B). It is well established that introns control a variety of mRNA activities, including sp"

Allosteric changes can be brought about by either a change in the dynamics of a protein, or alteration in its mean structure. We have investigated the mechanisms of allostery induced by chemically distinct ligands in the cGMP-binding, cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase, PDE5. PDE5 is the target for catalytic site inhibitors, such as sildenafil, that are used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension. PDE5 is a multidomain protein and contains two N-terminal cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase, bacterial adenylyl cyclase, FhLA transcriptional regulator (GAF) domains, and a C-terminal catalytic domain. Cyclic GMP binding to the GAFa domain and sildenafil binding to the catalytic domain result in conformational changes, which to date have been studied either with individual domains or with purified enzyme. Employing intramolecular bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, which can monitor conformational changes both in vitro and in intact cells, we show that binding of cGMP and sildenafil to PDE5 results in distinct conformations of the protein. Metal ions bound to the catalytic site also allosterically modulated cGMP- and sildenafil-induced conformational changes. The sildenafil-induced conformational change was temperature-sensitive, whereas cGMP-induced conformational change was independent of temperature. This indicates that different allosteric ligands can regulate the conformation of a multidomain protein by distinct mechanisms. Importantly, this novel PDE5 sensor has general physiological and clinical relevance because it allows the identification of regulators that can modulate PDE5 conformation in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2078134515,"F(1)-ATP synthase (F(1)-ATPase) is equipped with a special mechanism that prevents the wasteful reverse reaction, ATP hydrolysis, when there is insufficient proton motive force to drive ATP synthesis. Chloroplast F(1)-ATPase is subject to redox regulation, whereby ATP hydrolysis activity is regulated by formation and reduction of the disulfide bond located on the γ subunit. To understand the molecular mechanism of this redox regulation, we constructed a chimeric F(1) complex (α(3)β(3)γ(redox)) using cyanobacterial F(1), which mimics the regulatory properties of the chloroplast F(1)-ATPase, allowing the study of its regulation at the single molecule level. The redox state of the γ subunit did not affect the ATP binding rate to the catalytic site(s) and the torque for rotation. However, the long pauses caused by ADP inhibition were frequently observed in the oxidized state. In addition, the duration of continuous rotation was relatively shorter in the oxidized α(3)β(3)γ(redox) complex. These findings lead us to conclude that redox regulation of CF(1)-ATPase is achieved by controlling the probability of ADP inhibition via the γ subunit inserted region, a sequence feature observed in both cyanobacterial and chloroplast ATPase γ subunits, which is important for ADP inhibition (Sunamura, E., Konno, H., Imashimizu-Kobayashi, M., Sugano, Y., and Hisabori, T.

https://openalex.org/W1971129066,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae Kre6 is a type II membrane protein with amino acid sequence homology with glycoside hydrolase and is essential for β-1,6-glucan synthesis as revealed by the mutant phenotype, but its biochemical function is still unknown. The localization of Kre6, determined by epitope tagging, is a matter of debate. We raised anti-Kre6 rabbit antiserum and examined the localization of Kre6 and its tagged protein by immunofluorescence microscopy, subcellular fractionation in sucrose density gradients, and immunoelectron microscopy. Integration of the results indicates that the majority of Kre6 is in the endoplasmic reticulum; however, a small but significant portion is also present in the secretory vesicle-like compartments and plasma membrane. Kre6 in the latter compartments is observed as strong signals that accumulate at the sites of polarized growth by immunofluorescence. The truncated Kre6 without the N-terminal 230-amino acid cytoplasmic region did not show this polarized accumulation and had a severe defect in β-1,6-glucan synthesis. This is the first evidence of a β-1,6-glucan-related protein showing the polarized membrane localization that correlates with its biological function."
https://openalex.org/W2052457125,"Homocysteine sulfinic acid (HCSA) is a homologue of the amino acid cysteine and a selective metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist. However, the metabolic role of HCSA is poorly understood. In this study, we showed that HCSA and glutamate stimulated glucose uptake in C2C12 mouse myoblast cells and increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis revealed that C2C12 expresses mGluR5. HCSA transiently increased the intracellular calcium concentration. Although α-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine, a metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist, blocked the action of HCSA in intracellular calcium response and AMPK phosphorylation, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, an AMPA antagonist, did not exhibit such effects. Knockdown of mGluR5 with siRNA blocked HCSA-induced AMPK phosphorylation. Pretreatment of cells with STO-609, a calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) inhibitor, blocked HCSA-induced AMPK phosphorylation, and knockdown of CaMKK blocked HCSA-induced AMPK phosphorylation. In addition, HCSA activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Expression of dominant-negative AMPK suppressed HCSA-mediated phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, and inhibition of AMPK and p38 MAPK blocked HCSA-induced glucose uptake. Phosphorylation of protein kinase C ζ (PKCζ) was also increased by HCSA. Pharmacologic inhibition or knockdown of p38 MAPK blocked HCSA-induced PKCζ phosphorylation, and knockdown of PKCζ suppressed the HCSA-induced increase of cell surface GLUT4. The stimulatory effect of HCSA on cell surface GLUT4 was impaired in FITC-conjugated PKCζ siRNA-transfected cells. Together, the above results suggest that HCSA may have a beneficial role in glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle cells via stimulation of AMPK."
https://openalex.org/W2000670994,"microRNAs (miRNAs) are generally thought to negatively regulate the expression of their target genes by mRNA degradation or by translation repression. Here we show an efficient way to identify miRNA target genes by screening alterations in global mRNA levels following changes in miRNA levels. In this study, we used mRNA microarrays to measure global mRNA expression in three cell lines with increased or decreased levels of miR-16 and performed bioinformatics analysis based on multiple target prediction algorithms. For further investigation among the predicted miR-16 target genes, we selected genes that show an expression pattern opposite to that of miR-16. One of the candidate target genes that may interact with miR-16, ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 2 (ARL2), was further investigated. First, ARL2 was deduced to be an ideal miR-16 target by computational predictions. Second, ARL2 mRNA and protein levels were significantly abolished by treatment with miR-16 precursors, whereas a miR-16 inhibitor increased ARL2 mRNA and protein levels. Third, a luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-16 directly recognizes the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of ARL2. Finally, we showed that miR-16 could regulate proliferation and induce a significant G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, which was due at least in part, to the down-regulation of ARL2. In summary, the present study suggests that integrating global mRNA profiling and bioinformatics tools may provide the basis for further investigation of the potential targets of a given miRNA. These results also illustrate a novel function of miR-16 targeting ARL2 in modulating proliferation and cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W2008826649,"Sulfate reducers have developed a multifaceted adaptative strategy to survive against oxidative stresses. Along with this oxidative stress response, we recently characterized an elegant reversible disulfide bond-dependent protective mechanism in the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) of various Desulfovibrio species. Here, we searched for thiol redox systems involved in this mechanism. Using thiol fluorescent labeling, we show that glutathione is not the major thiol/disulfide balance-controlling compound in four different Desulfovibrio species and that no other plentiful low molecular weight thiol can be detected. Enzymatic analyses of two thioredoxins (Trxs) and three thioredoxin reductases allow us to propose the existence of two independent Trx systems in Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (DvH). The TR1/Trx1 system corresponds to the typical bacterial Trx system. We measured a TR1 apparent K(m) value for Trx1 of 8.9 μM. Moreover, our results showed that activity of TR1 was NADPH-dependent. The second system named TR3/Trx3 corresponds to an unconventional Trx system as TR3 used preferentially NADH (K(m) for NADPH, 743 μM; K(m) for NADH, 5.6 μM), and Trx3 was unable to reduce insulin. The K(m) value of TR3 for Trx3 was 1.12 μM. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the TR1/Trx1 system was the only one able to reactivate the oxygen-protected form of Desulfovibrio africanus PFOR. Moreover, ex vivo pulldown assays using the mutant Trx1(C33S) as bait allowed us to capture PFOR from the DvH extract. Altogether, these data demonstrate that PFOR is a new target for Trx1, which is probably involved in the protective switch mechanism of the enzyme."

In this study, we investigated PC4 coactivator function in the control of LHR transcription.

IntroductionThe luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) 2The abbreviations used are: LHR, luteinizing hormone receptor; DAPA, DNA affinity precipitation assay; TSA, trichostatin A; PC4, positive cofactor 4; HDAC, histone deacetylase; aa, amino acids. is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family and is essential for sexual development and reproduction in mammals. The LHR is predominantly located on the plasma membrane of gonadal cells, where it mediates the luteinizing hormone signals that regulate ovarian granulosa/luteal and testicular Leydig cell development and function. It is also found in non-gonadal cells, tumoral tissues, and cancer cells (1Dufau M.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 461-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 2Dufau M.L. Tsai-Morris C.-H.

Characterization of LHR transcriptional mechanisms revealed that the LHR gene is subject to repression/derepression through complex and diverse networks that include an epigenetic modulation at the promoter and association/dissociation of multiple effectors centered at the proximal Sp1 site of the promoter. Local chromatin changes resulting from histone acetylation and cell-specific CpG island methylation/demethylation within the promoter are critical for silencing and reactivation of the LHR gene in cancer cells (9Zhang Y. Fatima N. Dufau M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7929-7939Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Sp1 acts as an anchor to recruit histone deacetylases (HDAC)1/2/mSin3A corepressor complex and p107 repressor protein. This results in promoter localized hypo-acetylation that contributes to the silencing of LHR transcriptional expression. The participation of the PI3K/PKCζ was found to be essential for histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA-induced LHR activation in cancer cells (10Zhang Y. Liao M. Dufau M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6748-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PKCζ directly associates with Sp1 and phosphorylates Sp1 at Ser-641, which triggers dissociation of p107 repressor from Sp1, recruitment of TFII B and Pol II and LHR gene activation. TSA-induced chromatin changes cause cell-specific release of phosphatases which associate directly through Sp1, or indirectly through HDAC1/2 at the promoter. This serves as an on switch for Sp1 phosphorylation that triggers release of p107 repressor from Sp1 at the promoter and marked transcriptional activation of the LHR gene (11Zhang Y. Liao M. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24039-24046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Maximal derepression of the LHR gene upon TSA treatment is dependent on complete demethylation of the promoter, in conjunction with histone hyperacetylation and release of repressors (p107 and HDAC/mSin3A).Whereas the role of repressor/corepressors (e.g. HDAC1/2, mSin3A, p107) and their association/dissociation with Sp1 in TSA-induced repression/derepression of the LHR gene have been well characterized, the involvement of transcriptional coactivators in this process has not been elucidated. Histone acetylase transferases p300 and CBP have been reported to participate in transcriptional activation of many genes in response to the HDAC inhibitors (12Wang X. Pan L. Feng Y. Wang Y. Han Q.

As a transcriptional coactivator, PC4 is proposed to facilitate activator-dependent class II gene transcription through providing bridge interactions between components of the general transcription machinery and transcriptional activators such as GAL4-Sp1, GAL4-VP16, GAL4-BRCAL1, GAL4-OCA-B (15Kretzschmar M.

While PC4 was shown to increase transactivation of GAL-Sp1 in an in vitro reconstituted cell- free transcription system (15Kretzschmar M. Kaiser K. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. Cell. 1994; 78: 525-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 16Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), no functional in vivo evidence was provided for PC4-mediated Sp1 activation. In this study, we investigated the role of PC4 in basal LHR promoter activity and TSA-induced LHR gene transcription/expression. These studies have demonstrated a crucial aspect of LHR gene modulation, whereby PC4 acts as an essential coactivator of Sp1 to facilitate LH receptor transcription.DISCUSSIONThese studies have investigated the role of PC4 in the silencing and re-activation of LHR gene transcription. We found that PC4 markedly activates the Sp1- but not Sp3-dependent LHR promoter activity. This activation is associated with direct interaction between the coactivation domain of PC4 and Zn finger DNA binding domain of Sp1. Furthermore, PC4 is involved in Sp1-regulated LHR activation in response to TSA, and PC4 recruitment at the LHR promoter is significantly increased by TSA stimulation. Depletion of PC4 impaired TSA-induced recruitment of Pol II and TFIIB at the LHR promoter. Taken together, these findings have revealed a critical aspect of LHR modulation in which PC4 is a necessary coactivator in Sp1-dependent LHR derepression induced by TSA.In this study, we have demonstrated the coactivator function of PC4 with Sp1 in MCF-7 cells. PC4 markedly enhanced Sp1-dependent LHR promoter activity, but did not display an augmenting effect on the activity that is driven by Sp3 though both Sp1 and Sp3 function as activators of basal LHR gene expression (Fig. 1B). This result revealed a specific coactivator function of PC4 for Sp1-activated LHR gene transcription. This finding was supported by the association of PC4 with Sp1 at the Sp1 (I) site of LHR promoter (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the physical interaction between PC4 and Sp1 as determined by GST pull-down assay provides further evidence to support the coactivator role of PC4 for Sp1 activity in vivo (Fig. 3D). The identification of PC4 as a coactivator of LHR transcription in MCF-7 cells has revealed its crucial role in the physiological control of LHR gene expression.PC4 interacts with distinct domains of activators to mediate their functions. While the activation domains of many activators such as VP16, GAL4, and AP2 are responsible for PC4 interaction (16Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 17Kaiser K. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M.

Kannan P. Tainsky M.A. Gene. 2003; 320: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the basic RNA binding domain of HIV-TAT rather than its activating domain is found to interact with PC4 (22Holloway A.F. Occhiodoro F. Mittler G. Meisterernst M. Shannon M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21668-21677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In contrast, both the DNA binding domain and the highly flexible C-terminal regulatory domain of p53 bind PC4 to mediate the interaction with PC4 (24Batta K. Kundu T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7603-7614Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The current study has demonstrated that PC4 interacts with the DNA binding domain (DBD) of Sp1 in vitro, and three Zn fingers in the DBD contribute to this interaction (Fig. 5). The differential functional regions of activators required for their interactions with PC4 suggests a diverse mechanism underlying its coactivator function to mediate the transcriptional response to distinct types of activators. The Zn finger DBD of Sp1 has also been shown to be involved in interaction with other cofactors, such as human TAFII55, p300, the ATP-dependent nucleosomal remodeling enzyme SWI/SNF, and corepressor SMRT, NCoR, and BcoR (34Chiang C.M.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2441-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Those interactions are crucial in the regulation of many cellular functions by controlling gene expression at the transcriptional level. On the other hand, GST pull-down assay using the bacterial expressed Sp1 and in vitro translated PC4 proteins showed that the Sp1-interacting region of PC4 is localized to the region between residue 22 and 91, which is its coactivator domain, that further indicated the coactivator function of PC4 on Sp1 activity (Fig. 4, A and B). The relevance of this region for Sp1 interaction was also supported by functional analyses (Fig. 4C) in which the Sp1-mediated LHR promoter activity could be substantially activated by transfection of full-length PC4, deletion mutant PC4-(22–127), or PC4-(1–91) but not by the mutants that are devoid of the intact 22–91 region. Although we were unable to detect an interaction between Sp1 and PC4-(43–127) and PC4-(1–62) in GST pull-down assay, transfection of those two constructs could marginally stimulate the Sp1-driven LHR activity. This implies that a weak interaction might exist between Sp1 and the PC4 region of residue 43–91 or region of residue 22–63, which could ultimately contribute to the minimal activation of Sp1-mediated promoter activity observed.We have previously established that Sp1 is not only important for basal LHR promoter activity, but also has a key role in mediation of activated-LHR expression in cancer cells that are stimulated by TSA (3Tsai-Morris C.H.

At the silenced LHR promoter, Sp1 interacts directly or indirectly with a variety of repressor/corepressor factors (e.g. HDAC1/2/mSin3A, p107, PP1), and the release of such inhibitory complex/molecules is dependent on Sp1 phosphorylation and local chromatin changes (9Zhang Y. Fatima N. Dufau M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7929-7939Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 10Zhang Y. Liao M. Dufau M.L. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2008; 283: 24039-24046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These are essential regulatory mechanisms that lead to re-activation of LHR gene expression. This study reveals an additional regulatory component that involves recruitment of the coactivator PC4 of Sp1 in the control of LHR gene transcription. We found that PC4 directly associated with Sp1 at the promoter. Depletion of PC4 inhibited the basal LHR promoter activity and largely blocked TSA-induced LHR activation and mRNA expression. The residual promoter activity/transcription is indicative of the presence of other coactivator (s) that might be also involved in the TSA action. This coactivator activity could work independently or cooperatively with PC4 to mediate the overall activation of the LHR gene.PC4 has been reported to be regulated by post-translational modifications including phosphorylation and acetylation (15Kretzschmar M. Kaiser K. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. Cell. 1994; 78: 525-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 24Batta K. Kundu T.K. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2001; 276: 16804-16809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). CKII phosphorylates PC4 in vivo and such phosphorylation negatively regulates its coactivator functions, its interactions with the activator and TATA box-binding protein/TFIIA (15Kretzschmar M. Kaiser K. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. Cell. 1994; 78: 525-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 39Ge H. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 12691-12695Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In our studies, phosphorylation of PC4 exhibited a negative effect on the interaction between PC4 and Sp1 (Fig. 3). Sp1 interacted with the bacterial recombinant PC4 that is unphosphorylated, but not with PC4 that was phosphorylated by CKII. Conversely, nuclear PC4 that was treated with CIP largely increases the association of the two proteins at the promoter in DAPA experiments. Therefore, these results indicated that PC4 phosphorylation may play an important role in the TSA-induced activation. On the other hand, PC4 acetylation could also affect the function of PC4 with Sp1. PC4 is known to be acetylated by p300, and this acetylation stimulates its double stranded DNA binding activity, which is correlated with its coactivator function (40Kumar B.R. Swaminathan V. Banerjee S. Kundu T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16804-16809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that the inhibition of HDAC with TSA could lead to recruitment of a yet unknown protein with HAT activity that could mediate PC4 acetylation, which would enhance its interaction with Sp1 and thereby LHR gene activation.This study indicates that PC4 has an important role in the formation/assembly of general transcriptional machinery in the TSA-mediated LHR transcription. PC4 was recruited by Sp1 to the LHR promoter following TSA treatment. Loss of PC4 significantly blocked TSA-stimulated recruitment of Pol II and TFIIB (Fig. 7), which is correlated with a substantial reduction of TSA-mediated LHR activation. Similarly, the yeast PC4 homolog SUB1 facilitates osmoresponse gene transcription by promoting preinitiation complex formation (41Rosonina E. Willis I.M. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 2308-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although PC4 is also believed to be implicated in chromatin organization (42Das C. Gadad S.S. Kundu T.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 397: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), PC4 does not seem in this case to participate in TSA-induced chromatin structural alteration, because silencing of PC4 did not change the release of HDAC1/2/Sin3A and phosphatase release from Sp1, two events that are dependent on TSA-elicited DNA methylation and chromatin decompaction resulting from histone acetylation at local promoter (9Zhang Y. Fatima N. Dufau M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7929-7939Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 10Zhang Y. Liao M. Dufau M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6748-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 11Zhang Y. Liao M. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24039-24046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition, while TSA-induced TFIIB recruitment is largely dependent on PC4 recruitment, lack of interaction between PC4 and TFIIB in vitro and in vivo (data not shown) has ruled out the possibility that TFIIB is the potential target of PC4 to link Sp1 to the basal transcriptional machinery in TSA-induced LHR transcription. This is consistent with the report that in an in vitro system PC4 is unable to interact with free TFIIB, while it interacts with free or DNA-bound TFIIA and TBP components of the basal transcription machinery (17Kaiser K. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3520-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Moreover, knockdown of Med17/Trap80 did not block TSA-induced LHR activation in MCF-7 cells and it was not found to be recruited to the LHR promoter upon TSA treatment (data not shown). Thus, interaction with other members of this initiation complex and/or mediator complex is anticipated.PC4 binds the LHR promoter in vivo, and TSA treatment further induces its recruitment. These data, along with our previous observations, have revealed complex regulation that releases inhibitory factors, and recruitment of positive PC4 cofactor cooperatively contributes to maximum activation of this gene. However, while the release of repressor p107 is triggered by PI3K/PKCζ-mediated Sp1 phosphorylation (10Zhang Y. Liao M. Dufau M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6748-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), recruitment of PC4 to LHR promoter is independent of such phosphorylation since the inhibition of PI3K/PKCζ with its specific inhibitor (Wortmannin) did not block TSA-induced PC4 recruitment (Fig. 6D). A mechanism other than Sp1 phosphorylation might engage to cause its recruitment. In addition, TSA-mediated dissociation of p107, HDAC/mSin3A complex and phosphatase from the promoter was not significantly affected by knockdown of PC4 (Fig. 7B). Together these findings led us to propose that the critical role of PC4 in TSA-induced LHR gene expression is independent of Sp1 phosphorylation and release of corepressors, and it may function as a coactivator linker between Sp1 and one or more components of the preinitiation complex (Fig. 7C). IntroductionThe luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) 2The abbreviations used are: LHR, luteinizing hormone receptor; DAPA, DNA affinity precipitation assay; TSA, trichostatin A; PC4, positive cofactor 4; HDAC, histone deacetylase; aa, amino acids. is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family and is essential for sexual development and reproduction in mammals. The LHR is predominantly located on the plasma membrane of gonadal cells, where it mediates the luteinizing hormone signals that regulate ovarian granulosa/luteal and testicular Leydig cell development and function. It is also found in non-gonadal cells, tumoral tissues, and cancer cells (1Dufau M.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 461-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 2Dufau M.L. Tsai-Morris C.-H. Payne A.H. Hardy M.P. Contemporary Endocrinology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa2007: 227-252Google Scholar), and these have provided a convenient model to study modalities of LHR transcriptional regulation.The TATA-less LHR promoter contains two activating Sp1 binding domains and an upstream inhibitory motif that binds nuclear orphan receptors (3Tsai-Morris C.H.

Characterization of LHR transcriptional mechanisms revealed that the LHR gene is subject to repression/derepression through complex and diverse networks that include an epigenetic modulation at the promoter and association/dissociation of multiple effectors centered at the proximal Sp1 site of the promoter. Local chromatin changes resulting from histone acetylation and cell-specific CpG island methylation/demethylation within the promoter are critical for silencing and reactivation of the LHR gene in cancer cells (9Zhang Y. Fatima N. Dufau M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7929-7939Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Sp1 acts as an anchor to recruit histone deacetylases (HDAC)1/2/mSin3A corepressor complex and p107 repressor protein. This results in promoter localized hypo-acetylation that contributes to the silencing of LHR transcriptional expression. The participation of the PI3K/PKCζ was found to be essential for histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA-induced LHR activation in cancer cells (10Zhang Y. Liao M. Dufau M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6748-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PKCζ directly associates with Sp1 and phosphorylates Sp1 at Ser-641, which triggers dissociation of p107 repressor from Sp1, recruitment of TFII B and Pol II and LHR gene activation. TSA-induced chromatin changes cause cell-specific release of phosphatases which associate directly through Sp1, or indirectly through HDAC1/2 at the promoter. This serves as an on switch for Sp1 phosphorylation that triggers release of p107 repressor from Sp1 at the promoter and marked transcriptional activation of the LHR gene (11Zhang Y. Liao M. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24039-24046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Maximal derepression of the LHR gene upon TSA treatment is dependent on complete demethylation of the promoter, in conjunction with histone hyperacetylation and release of repressors (p107 and HDAC/mSin3A).Whereas the role of repressor/corepressors (e.g. HDAC1/2, mSin3A, p107) and their association/dissociation with Sp1 in TSA-induced repression/derepression of the LHR gene have been well characterized, the involvement of transcriptional coactivators in this process has not been elucidated. Histone acetylase transferases p300 and CBP have been reported to participate in transcriptional activation of many genes in response to the HDAC inhibitors (12Wang X. Pan L. Feng Y. Wang Y. Han Q.

To elucidate SPRED2 in vivo function, we characterized body homeostasis in SPRED2(-/-) mice. They showed a doubled daily water uptake, induced by elevated serum osmolality, originating from increased blood salt load. Accordingly, serum aldosterone was doubled, accompanied by augmented adrenal aldosterone synthase (AS) expression. Surprisingly, serum vasopressin (AVP) was unaltered, and, as evidenced by halved angiotensin II (Ang II) levels, the renin angiotensin system (RAS) was down-regulated. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was significantly elevated in SPRED2(-/-) mice, together with its secretagogue corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and its downstream target corticosterone. ERK phosphorylation in brains was augmented, and hypothalamic CRH mRNA levels were elevated, both contributing to the increased CRH release. Our data were supported by CRH promoter reporter assays in hypothalamic mHypoE-44 cells, revealing a SPRED-dependent inhibition of Ets (ERK/E-twenty-six)-dependent transcription. Furthermore, SPRED suppressed CRH production in these cells. In conclusion, our study suggests that SPRED2 deficiency leads to an increased MAPK signaling, which results in an augmented CRH promoter activity. The subsequent CRH overproduction causes an up-regulation of downstream hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) hormone secretion. This constitutes a possible trigger for the observed compulsive grooming in SPRED2(-/-) mice and may, together with hyperplasia of aldosterone-producing cells, contribute to the hyperaldosteronism and homeostatic imbalances."

When mixed with other RecA variants, RecA K72R causes a drop in the rate of ATP hydrolysis and has been used to study disassembly of hydrolysis-proficient RecA protein filaments. RecA K72R filaments do not form in the presence of ATP but do so when dATP is provided. We demonstrate that in the presence of ATP, RecA K72R is defective for extension of RecA filaments on DNA. This defect is partially rescued when the mutant protein is mixed with sufficient levels of wild type RecA protein. Functional extension complexes form most readily when wild type RecA is in excess of RecA K72R. Thus, RecA K72R inhibits hydrolysis-proficient RecA proteins by interacting with them in solution and preventing the extension phase of filament assembly.

The bacterial RecA protein catalyzes recombinational DNA repair. Homologs of RecA are present in all forms of life including the RadA protein of Archaea and the Rad51 and Dmc1 proteins of eukaryotes (1Brendel V. Brocchieri L. Sandler S.J. Clark A.J. Karlin S. J.

Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). The conservation of RecA proteins highlights their importance to genome integrity. In Escherichia coli, the 352-amino acid 37,842-Da RecA protein also plays a role inducing the expression of DNA repair proteins in response to DNA damage through a regulatory network known as the SOS response. To carry out recombinational DNA repair or to stimulate the SOS response, RecA protein must first bind to DNA. RecA can bind both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA (ssDNA and dsDNA, respectively), but it binds preferentially to ssDNA (7Lusetti S.L. Cox M.M. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 71-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). When binding either type of DNA, RecA forms extended, oligomeric filaments along the length of the DNA deoxyribose-phosphate backbone. The RecA/DNA nucleoprotein filament is a right-handed helix with the DNA on the inside of the filament groove and the RecA along the outside. There are six RecA monomers per turn of the filament and three nucleotides (or base pairs) per monomer, although each monomer makes contacts with the nucleotide triplet of the adjacent monomer (8Chen Z. Yang H. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2008; 453: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). RecA nucleoprotein filaments can assume a variety of conformational states depending on the presence and identity of the nucleotide cofactor and the DNA substrate (for review, see Ref. 7Lusetti S.L. Cox M.M. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 71-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). RecA can bind to ssDNA in the absence of a nucleotide cofactor or in the presence of ADP and form a compact, “collapsed” filament with a pitch of 64 Å that is not active for RecA-related activities (9Heuser J. Griffith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Egelman E.H. Stasiak A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 677-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This filament state is also referred to as the O state (11Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In the presence of ATP, dATP, ATPγS, 3The abbreviations used are: ATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)SSB proteinssDNA-binding proteincssDNAcircular ssDNAFPfluorescence polarizationntnucleotide(s). or ADP-AlF4−, RecA filaments are more extended, with a pitch of 95 Å (10Egelman E.H. Stasiak A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 677-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These filaments are said to be in the “active” or A state (11Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). RecA filaments bound to dsDNA or that actively catalyze exchange of homologous DNA strands exist in the P or “pairing enhanced” state (12Haruta N. Yu X. Yang S. Egelman E.H. Cox M.M. J. Biol.

The formation of RecA filaments on DNA is a dynamic process. The first and rate-limiting step of filament formation is nucleation (13Kowalczykowski S.C. Clow J. Krupp R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 3127-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 14Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1326-1336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Nucleation is inhibited by the single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) protein (18Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 19Thresher R.J. Christiansen G. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20Joo C. McKinney S.A. Nakamura M. Rasnik I. Myong S. Ha T. Cell. 2006; 126: 515-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Inhibition of nucleation by SSB can be overcome with the help of the RecF, RecO, and RecR proteins (for review, see Ref. 21Cox M.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 42: 41-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The rate of nucleation onto SSB-bound DNA can also be enhanced using dATP as a nucleotide cofactor (22Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5871-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) by deleting the C-terminal 17 amino acid residues of RecA (23Eggler A.L. Lusetti S.L. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16389-16396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or by mutating residue Glu-38 to Lys (RecA E38K or RecA730) (24Witkin E.M. McCall J.O. Volkert M.R. Wermundsen I.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1982; 185: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 25Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20648-20658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After nucleation, the RecA filament rapidly extends in the 5′ to 3′ direction with respect to the bound DNA (26Register 3rd, J.C. Griffith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12308-12312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Extension of the filament can occur at rates greater than 1000 monomers/min at 37 °C (28Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Information on the RecA species involved in the extension phase of filament formation is limited. Two single-molecule studies have addressed the issue but come to different conclusions with either monomers (20Joo C. McKinney S.A. Nakamura M. Rasnik I. Myong S. Ha T. Cell. 2006; 126: 515-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) or a larger oligomer (17van Loenhout M.T. van der Heijden T. Kanaar R. Wyman C. Dekker C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) being the relevant species. Secondary structure in long ssDNA substrates can inhibit RecA filament extension (18Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In RecA assays in vitro, SSB is often added after nucleation takes place to melt out secondary structure in the DNA. SSB does not pose a barrier to RecA filament extension in vitro (18Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 20Joo C. McKinney S.A. Nakamura M. Rasnik I. Myong S. Ha T. Cell. 2006; 126: 515-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). RecA filament disassembly occurs from the 5′-proximal end of the filament and also proceeds in the 5′ to 3′ direction with respect to the bound DNA (27Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 29Bork J.M. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45740-45743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The rate of RecA filament disassembly is slower than the rate of filament extension, occurring at 60–70 monomers/min/filament end (30Arenson T.A. Tsodikov O.V. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although some RecA protein can add to the 5′-proximal end of the filament and some disassembly can occur from the interior of the filament or at the 3′-proximal end of the filament, these events are limited in rate and in scope (20Joo C. McKinney S.A. Nakamura M. Rasnik I. Myong S. Ha T. Cell. 2006; 126: 515-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Thus, filament assembly and disassembly are generally end-dependent processes occurring at opposite filament ends, especially when ATP is being hydrolyzed. Once RecA protein is bound to DNA, it can hydrolyze ATP. All subunits throughout the filament hydrolyze ATP with no enhancement of hydrolysis at the filament ends (31Brenner S.L. Mitchell R.S. Morrical S.W. Neuendorf S.K. Schutte B.C. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4011-4016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RecA can hydrolyze several other (d)NTPs (for review, see Ref. 28Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the most thoroughly studied alternative cofactor used in RecA assays is dATP. When bound to ssDNA, RecA hydrolyzes ATP with a monomer kcat of 30 min−1 (7Lusetti S.L. Cox M.M. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 71-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 31Brenner S.L.

The kcat for RecA bound to dsDNA is 20 min−1 (for review, see Ref. 7Lusetti S.L. Cox M.M. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 71-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Binding and hydrolysis of the nucleotide cofactor occur at the monomer-monomer interfaces of the RecA filament. RecA contains canonical Walker A and Walker B motifs (residues 66–73 and 140–144, respectively) for ATP binding (Ref. 34Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4252) Google Scholar, and for review, see Ref. 7Lusetti S.L. Cox M.M. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 71-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). These motifs are present on the 3′-proximal face of a RecA monomer within a filament (8Chen Z. Yang H. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2008; 453: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Residues from the 5′-proximal face of the adjacent monomer, including Lys-248 and Lys-250, also make contact with the nucleotide cofactor (8Chen Z. Yang H. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2008; 453: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 35Cox J.M. Abbott S.N. Chitteni-Pattu S. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12968-12975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Amino acids on both sides of the interface participate in hydrolysis of the nucleotide cofactor including Glu-96, Lys-72, and Lys-248 (35Cox J.M. Abbott S.N. Chitteni-Pattu S. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J.

Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1292-1297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several RecA-mediated activities depend on ATP hydrolysis (for review, see Ref. 11Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). RecA filament disassembly requires ATP hydrolysis. Exchange of homologous DNA strands that are more than 1000 bp long, exchange past sites of DNA damage or heterology, and exchange between two homologous duplex DNA molecules also require ATP hydrolysis. The importance of ATP hydrolysis to RecA function has been addressed by mutation of the conserved Lys-72 of the Walker A motif to arginine (K72R) (38Rehrauer W.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1292-1297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of the equivalent lysine residue in the Walker A motifs of other nucleotide-binding proteins had been made previously and resulted in nonfunctional mutant proteins (39Sung P. Higgins D. Prakash L. Prakash S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 40Dombroski A.J. Brennan C.A. Spear P. Platt T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 7158-7165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In RecA, the conservative K72R mutant protein binds to DNA and nucleotide cofactors but catalyzes negligible amounts of ATP hydrolysis (38Rehrauer W.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1292-1297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional experiments with the RecA K72R mutant protein reinforced the finding that ATP binding, but not hydrolysis, was necessary for pairing homologous strands of DNA (38Rehrauer W.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1292-1297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78: 3433-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 45Shan Q. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5712-5724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). After its discovery, RecA K72R became a useful tool in studying the filament dynamics of RecA proteins that are hydrolysis-proficient. It was used to demonstrate that very little disassembly of RecA filaments occurs from the interior of the filament (46Shan Q. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 756-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), that RecA filaments on dsDNA are more dynamic than those bound to ssDNA (46Shan Q. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 756-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), that RecA filaments disassemble over the course of DNA strand exchange (47Shan Q. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11063-11073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and that RecA filament disassembly is necessary to complete exchange of long homologous DNA substrates (48Britt R.L. Haruta N. Lusetti S.L. Chitteni-Pattu S. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3211-3226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). If differing ratios of the wild type and the mutant RecA proteins are premixed before incubating them with circular single-stranded DNA (cssDNA), the decrease in ATP hydrolysis rate is greater than that expected if the hydrolysis-deficient RecA K72R were simply occluding binding sites on the DNA (46Shan Q. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 756-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This result provides evidence for interaction between the two RecA proteins and formation of mixed filaments on DNA. The addition of RecA K72R to a wild type RecA filament on cssDNA in the presence of ATP leads to a decrease in the rate of ATP hydrolysis (46Shan Q. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 756-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A decrease in wild type RecA-mediated ATP hydrolysis suggests that the hydrolysis-deficient RecA K72R can interact with a wild type filament even if the mutant protein cannot form its own filaments on cssDNA. Lysine 72 is present at the RecA monomer-monomer interface. Mutation of lysine 72 to arginine may distort the interface or may alter the position of the nucleotide cofactor such that additional RecA protein cannot join the growing end of the filament. This filament extension defect in RecA K72R would effectively cap the growing end of the filament and eventually result in net disassembly of the wild type RecA filament. The E. coli RecX protein is also thought to inhibit RecA by capping the growing end of a filament (49Drees J.C. Lusetti S.L. Chitteni-Pattu S. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Use of the RecA K72R mutant in vivo initially suggested that ATP hydrolysis is necessary for RecA to trigger the SOS response (50Renzette N. Sandler S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 67: 1347-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A later study by the same group showed that a lack of filament formation by the RecA K72R protein in vivo was what had inhibited induction of the SOS response (51Gruenig M.C. Renzette N. Long E. Chitteni-Pattu S. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. Sandler S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 1165-1179PubMed Google Scholar). Introducing a Glu-38 to Lys mutation in addition to K72R restores RecA filament formation in the presence of ATP in vitro. ATP is still bound but not hydrolyzed by the double mutant protein, which also supports SOS induction in vivo (51Gruenig M.C. Renzette N. Long E. Chitteni-Pattu S. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. Sandler S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 1165-1179PubMed Google Scholar). The RecA E38K/K72R provides a better platform for studying some aspects of the function of RecA-mediated ATP hydrolysis than does RecA K72R. However, this double mutant protein does not allow investigation of RecA filament dynamics, as we will show. A continued need for RecA K72R as a tool to investigate the filament dynamics of other RecA proteins led us to better characterize the filament formation defect of this mutant protein in the presence of ATP. A lack of RecA filament formation could be attributed to defects in either the nucleation or the extension phases of this process or both. We find that RecA K72R is defective in the extension phase of filament formation. In particular, our results help to resolve the literature controversy about the RecA species involved in filament extension. Using ensemble rather than single molecule methods, we provide evidence that RecA protein adds to the 3′-proximal end of a filament as oligomers during the extension phase of RecA filament formation. This further implicates an oligomeric RecA species in both phases of RecA filament formation. Circular single-stranded DNA was derived from M13mp18 bacteriophage and was purified by CsCl banding as previously described (12Haruta N. Yu X. Yang S. Egelman E.H. Cox M.M. J. Biol.

Concentrations of M13mp18 are reported in terms in of μm nucleotides (μm nt) using a conversion factor of 108 μm nt A260 nm−1.

The concentration of fluorescent oligonucleotide is reported in terms of μm molecules. The wild type E. coli RecA, RecA K72R, RecA E38K/K72R, and SSB proteins were purified as previously described (45Shan Q. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol.

Fluorescence polarization was used to measure direct binding of RecA K72R or wild type RecA to ssDNA using either ATP, dATP, or ATPγS as a nucleotide cofactor. The fluorescent entity in these experiments was the 3′ fluorescein-labeled 50-nt oligomer described above. FP experiments had a reaction solution of 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.8, 80% cation), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 3 mm potassium glutamate, 5% w/v glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 3 mm ATP, dATP, or ATPγS. RecA was serially diluted in the storage buffer. Fluorescent oligonucleotide at a final concentration of 10 nm molecule was added to the diluted RecA and incubated in the dark for 20 min at 37 °C. Each dilution was done in triplicate. The polarization of each sample was measured in triplicate on a Beacon 2000 fluorescence polarization system (Invitrogen) at 37 °C. The data were plotted and fit to a modified form of the Hill equation, y = (Bmin + (Bmax − Bmin))(xn/(Kdn + xn)) (55Bindslev N.

All EM assays contained a reaction solution of 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5, 88% cation), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 3 mm potassium glutamate, 5% w/v glycerol, 12 mm phosphocreatine, and 10 units/ml creatine phosphokinase to regenerate ATP, and 4 μm M13mp18 cssDNA. All reactions contained 3 mm ATP and 0.4 μm SSB, although the timing of their addition varies among experiments. In the EM experiment with a substoichiometric amount of wild type RecA to form nucleation points for RecA K72R, the reaction solution was incubated with ATP and SSB for 10 min at 37 °C before the addition of wild type RecA to a final concentration of 0.133 μm. The reactions were incubated for 20 additional min, and then a sample was removed for spreading before RecA K72R, or additional wild type RecA was added to achieve a final concentration of 2 μm, with the total RecA concentration being 2.133 μm. Subsequent samples were removed at the indicated times for spreading on activated carbon grids and eventual visualization. EM experiments in which wild type and RecA K72R proteins were premixed before the addition to M13mp18 cssDNA contained varying ratios of wild type RecA and RecA K72R proteins as listed in the legends to Figs. 3, 5, and 7 and accompanying text. The total RecA concentration was maintained at 2 μm. The RecA proteins were incubated with the reaction solution at 37 °C for 10 min before the addition of ATP and SSB. The complete reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min before spreading on activated carbon grids.FIGURE 5Wild type RecA and RecA K72R from shortened filaments on cssDNA when premixed in solution. Wild type RecA and RecA K72R were mixed in the same ratios as in Fig. 4 before the addition to cssDNA, and images of the resulting RecA filaments were obtained by EM as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The concentrations of DNA, RecA, ATP, and SSB are the same as in the legend to Fig. 4. A, images of RecA filaments at 0, 25, 50, and 75% RecA K72R were obtained at 15,000× magnification. B, more than 200 filaments at 0, 25, 50, and 75% RecA K72R were visually inspected and grouped into Full, Medium, Small, or Miscellaneous (Misc) length categories as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bars represent the average percentage of RecA filaments in each length category as counted from four randomly selected squares on carbon grids containing spread reaction samples with 0, 25, 50, or 75% RecA K72R. Error bars represent 1 S.D. from the mean.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 7RecA filaments decrease in length after wild type RecA bound to cssDNA is challenged with RecA K72R. Wild type RecA filaments formed on cssDNA were challenged with varying concentrations of RecA K72R as in Fig. 6, and the resultant filaments were imaged by EM as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The concentrations of DNA, RecA, ATP, and SSB are the same as in the legend to Fig. 6B. A, images of RecA filaments before, 20, 40, and 60 min after the addition of RecA K72R were obtained at 15,000× magnification. B, more than 400 filaments at 0, 20, 40, and 60 min after RecA K72R addition were visually inspected and grouped into the same length categories as Fig. 5B and as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bars represent the average percentage of RecA filaments in each length category as counted from four randomly selected squares on carbon grids containing spread reaction samples from each time point.

A sample was removed for spreading after an additional 20 min of incubation at 37 °C, and then RecA K72R was added to achieve a final concentration of 2.6 μm. Subsequent samples were removed at the indicated times for spreading on activated carbon grids. Samples from the reaction mixtures described above were diluted 3.25-fold with 200 mm ammonium acetate, 10 mm HEPES, and 10% (w/v) glycerol, pH adjusted to 7.5, and adsorbed to an activated carbon grid for 3 min. The grid was then touched to a drop of the above buffer followed by floating on a drop of the same buffer for 1 min. The sample was then stained by touching to a drop of 5% uranyl acetate followed by floating on a fresh drop of the same solution for 30 s. Finally, the grid was washed by touching to a drop of double-distilled water followed by immersion in two, 10-ml beakers of double distilled water. After the sample was dried, it was rotary-shadowed with platinum. This protocol is designed for visualization of complete reaction mixtures, and no attempt was made to remove proteins not bound to DNA, which can lead to a high background of unbound proteins. Prepared samples were observed, and images were obtained using a TECNAI G2 12 Twin Electron Microscope (FEI Co.) equipped with a GATAN 890 CCD camera. Pictures were taken at 15,000 × magnification. To determine how RecA filament length changed when RecA K72R was present, at least 200 filaments per time point or RecA K72R/wild type RecA ratio from at least four squares on the carbon grids were counted at an identical magnificati"
