https://openalex.org/W2156707826,"Human visual speed perception is qualitatively consistent with a Bayesian observer that optimally combines noisy measurements with a prior preference for lower speeds. Quantitative validation of this model, however, is difficult because the precise noise characteristics and prior expectations are unknown. Here, we present an augmented observer model that accounts for the variability of subjective responses in a speed discrimination task. This allowed us to infer the shape of the prior probability as well as the internal noise characteristics directly from psychophysical data. For all subjects, we found that the fitted model provides an accurate description of the data across a wide range of stimulus parameters. The inferred prior distribution shows significantly heavier tails than a Gaussian, and the amplitude of the internal noise is approximately proportional to stimulus speed and depends inversely on stimulus contrast. The framework is general and should prove applicable to other experiments and perceptual modalities."

Nrf2 should be coordinated with the canonical cell survival pathway represented by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the Ser/Thr kinase Akt but so far the mechanistic connections remain undefined. Here we identify glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), which is inhibited by Akt-mediated phosphorylation, as the link between both processes. Using heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) as a model phase II gene, we found that both PI3K and Akt increased mRNA and protein levels of this enzyme. Pharmacological inhibitors (LiCl and PDZD-8) and genetic variants of GSK-3β (constitutively active and dominant negative mutants) indicated that PI3K/Akt activates and GSK-3β inhibits the antioxidant response elements of the ho1 promoter and pointed Nrf2 as directly involved in this process. Indeed, GSK-3β phosphorylated Nrf2 in vitro and in vivo. Immunocytochemistry and subcellular fractionation analyses demonstrated that the effect of GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation of Nrf2 is to exclude this transcription factor from the nucleus. Nrf2 up-regulated the expression of HO-1, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase A1, NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase and glutamate-cysteine ligase and protected against hydrogen peroxide-induced glutathione depletion and cell death, whereas co-expression of active GSK-3β attenuated both phase II gene expression and oxidant protection. These results contribute to clarify the cross-talk between the survival signal elicited by PI3K/Akt and the antioxidant phase II cell response, and introduce GSK-3β as the key mediator of this regulation mechanism.

When ROS levels exceed the cell capacity to maintain redox homeostasis, a condition termed oxidative stress occurs, which results in the oxidation of cellular macromolecules and leads to cell death. The detrimental accumulation of ROS plays an important role in multiple pathologies, including neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and aging (1Moreira P.I.

To maintain redox homeostasis, aerobic cells have developed an antioxidant armamentarium that includes a group of antixenobiotic genes termed phase II detoxification genes (5Itoh K. Ishii T. Wakabayashi N. Yamamoto M. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 31: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 6Rushmore T.H. Kong A.N. Curr. Drug Metab. 2002; 3: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). These genes include NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1, glutathione S-transferases, glutamate-cysteine ligase, glutathione peroxidases, and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). The enzyme HO-1 degrades heme to release equimolar amounts of free iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin, the latter being converted to bilirubin by the ubiquitous enzyme biliverdin reductase (7Maines M.D. Gibbs P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 568-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Induction of a moderate intracellular heme catabolism through HO-1 represents an adaptive and protective response to oxidative injury because bilirubin is a very potent antioxidant (8Dore S.

Choi A.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional up-regulation of phase II genes, including HO-1, is critically dependent on a common cis-acting enhancer sequence, termed antioxidant response element (ARE) (11Nguyen T. Huang H.C. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15466-15473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 12Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1199-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have provided clear evidence that the transcription factor nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a crucial molecule in the regulation of basal and induced expression of phase II genes through regulation of AREs (13McMahon M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Chanas S.A. Henderson C.J. McLellan L.I. Wolf C.R. Cavin C. Hayes J.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3299-3307PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kwak M.K. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Sutter T.R. Kensler T.W. Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 135-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nrf2 is a member of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor family featuring a cap'n'collar motif (15Itoh K. Igarashi K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4184-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 16Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9926-9930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). It forms heterodimers with members of the Jun (17Jeyapaul J. Jaiswal A.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 1433-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and small Maf (18Katsuoka F. Motohashi H. Ishii T. Aburatani H. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8044-8051Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) proteins to bind AREs and transactivate ARE-containing genes. AREs are also subjected to negative regulation by heterodimers made with small Mafs, such as MafK, and the heme-binding protein Bach1 (19Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jain A.K. Bloom D.A. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16891-16900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 20Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5301-5312Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Considering that both Nrf2 and Bach1 form heterodimers with small Maf proteins in the nucleus to activate or repress AREs, respectively, it is clear that Nrf2 levels must be tightly regulated (21Nguyen T. Yang C.S. Pickett C.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Under conditions where high levels of the phase II gene products are not required, Nrf2 interacts with the BTB-Kelch protein Keap1, and this association promotes Nrf2 ubiquitination by the cullin-3-ROK1 complex and subsequent degradation by the proteasome (22Zhang D.D.

Chem. 2003; 278: 4536-4541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Therefore, under normal conditions, Nrf2 protein levels are barely detectable. On the other hand, oxidant insults promote the dissociation of the Nrf2-Keap1 complex, resulting in stabilization of the Nrf2 protein, translocation to the nucleus, and up-regulation of phase II genes (29Kang K.W. Lee S.J. Kim S.G. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2005; 7: 1664-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the control of nuclear Nrf2 accumulation remain unexplored. Recent reports have characterized import and export signals in Nrf2 and have suggested that this factor might by subjected to regulation at the level of cellular location (30Li W. Jain M.R. Chen C.

Phosphorylation is a common post-translational modification implicated in the regulation of numerous transcription factors (32Brownawell A.M. Kops G.J. Macara I.G. Burgering B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3534-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 33Ginger R.S. Dalton E.C. Ryves W.J. Fukuzawa M. Williams J.G. Harwood A.J.

Science. 1997; 275: 1930-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) but the possible role of Nrf2 phosphorylation in the regulation of its subcellular distribution remains unknown. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) is a Ser/Thr kinase involved in a variety of metabolic processes that include glycogen metabolism, Wnt signaling and sensitization to apoptosis (35Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Regarding oxidative stress, GSK-3β intervenes in oxidative-stress-mediated apoptosis through caspase-3 by releasing cytochrome c from mitochondria (36Koh S.H. Kim S.H. Kwon H. Kim J.G. Kim J.H. Yang K.H. Kim J. Kim S.U. Yu H.J. Do B.R. Kim K.S. Jung H.K. Neurotoxicology. 2004; 25: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been shown that inhibition of GSK-3β activity by either overexpression of the GSK-3β-binding protein, FRAT-1, or the use of a kinase-dead dominant negative mutant of GSK-3β, or pharmacological inhibitors such as lithium, results in a decreased susceptibility of cortical neurons to trophic withdrawal-induced cell death (37Schafer M. Goodenough S. Moosmann B. Behl C. Brain Res. 2004; 1005: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, GSK-3β has emerged as a new regulator of cell death but the mechanism whereby GSK-3β sensitizes cells to external insults such as oxidant injury is unknown. GSK-3β is tightly regulated by the survival pathway represented by phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and its downstream effector the Ser/Thr kinase Akt. This pathway is activated in response to growth factors and neurotrophins but also by external oxidants such as H2O2 (38Martin D. Salinas M. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Cuadrado A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42943-42952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 39Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem.

Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1000-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), etc. PI3K and Akt inhibit apoptosis by mechanisms that may involve in part the inactivation of GSK-3β (41Woodgett J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 37Schafer M. Goodenough S. Moosmann B. Behl C. Brain Res. 2004; 1005: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) because GSK-3β activity is negatively regulated by Akt-mediated phosphorylation at Ser-9 in the pseudosubstrate domain (41Woodgett J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). At this time, the possible connection between PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β and the regulation of the Nrf2-induced antioxidant response remains to be established. In this study, we identify Nrf2 as a substrate of GSK-3β and we show that this kinase governs its subcellular location. Our observations provide a mechanistic interpretation for the proapoptotic effects of GSK-3β through inhibition of Nrf2 function and contribute to elucidate the regulation of this transcription factor. Cell Culture and Reagents—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco′s modified Eagle′s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 80 μg/ml gentamycin.

Luciferase Assays—HEK293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates (75,000 cells per well), cultured for 16 h and transfected with calcium phosphate. After 24 h from transfection, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity with the luciferase assay system (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Relative light units were measured in a BG1 Optocomp I, GEM Biomedical luminometer (Sparks, NV). Immunoblotting—The primary antibodies used were anti-Nrf2(C-20), anti-Akt1 (C-20), and anti-Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); anti-phospho-Thr308 Akt-1 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA); anti-phospho-Ser9-GSK-3β (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); anti-HO-1 and anti-HO-2 (Stressgen Biotech Corp., Victoria, British Columbia, Canada); anti-V5 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA); anti-HA and anti-AU5 (Covance, Berkeley, CA); antiphospho-Ser antibodies (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) and anti-protein-disulfide isomerase (gift from Dr. J. G. Castaño, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas, Madrid, Spain). Cells were washed once with cold PBS and lysed on ice with lysis buffer (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Precleared cell lysates were resolved in SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). These membranes were analyzed using the primary antibodies indicated above and appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Preparation of Nuclear and Cytosolic Extracts—Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were prepared as previously described (58Minc E. de Coppet P. Masson P. Thiery L. Dutertre S. Amor-Gueret M. Jaulin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 503-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 million cells were washed three times with cold PBS and harvested by centrifugation at 1100 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended carefully in three pellet volumes of cold buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.15 mm EDTA, 0.015 mm EGTA, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Then, the homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. The supernatant corresponding to the cytosolic fraction was resolved in SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-V5 or anti-PDI antibodies. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in five pellet volumes of cold buffer B (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25% glycerol, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). After centrifugation in the same conditions indicated above, the nuclei were resuspended in two pellet volumes of hypertonic cold buffer C (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25% glycerol, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in a rotating wheel. Nuclear debris was removed by centrifugation at 900 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was resolved in SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-V5 and anti-Sp1 antibodies. In Vitro Kinase Assays—In vitro phosphorylation was performed in two different ways: (i) using bacterially expressed His-tagged Nrf2, isolated with the ProBond™ purification system (Invitrogen), and (ii) using immunocomplexes with V5-tagged Nrf2 or AU5-tagged c-Jun, that were immunoprecipitated with anti-V5- or anti-AU5-specific antibodies, respectively, from HEK293T cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1 Nrf2ΔETGE-V5 or pCEFL AU5-c-Jun. In both cases, the kinase assays were performed using 5 ng of active recombinant GSK-3β (Upstate Biotechnology) per reaction; briefly, substrate was incubated with the kinase and 5 μCi of [γ32P]ATP in 25 μl of reaction buffer (10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP in 40 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, and 1 mm EDTA) for 20 min at 30 °C with continuous shaking. Kinase reactions were resolved in SDS-PAGE, transferred to immobilon-P membranes, and exposed to autoradiography or immunoblotted. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were washed once with cold PBS and harvested by centrifugation at 1100 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in three pellet volumes of cold lysis buffer (340 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C in a rotating wheel. Then, they were precleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. To prevent the NaCl interference in association between the protein and its specific antibody, NaCl concentration was diluted to 200 mm. 5 μl of the corresponding antibody were added per lysate, and after incubation for 3 h at 4°C in a rotating wheel, gamma-bind Sepharose-protein G was added (Amersham Biosciences), and then incubated for one more hour at 4 °C. The complexes were harvested by centrifugation, washed five times with lysis buffer, resolved in SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted. Immunocytochemistry—HEK293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates (75,000 cells per well), on poly-d-Lys covered slides, cultured for 16 h and transfected with calcium phosphate. After 24 h from transfection, cells were, in some cases, treated with lithium chloride 5 mm (for 6 h). Then, cells were washed with cold PBS and fixed by incubation for 15 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde. After three 5-min washes with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min. The slides were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h and 30 min at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. Then, cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies for 45 min under the same conditions. To visualize the nuclei, cells were stained with DAPI. The fluorescence images were captured using appropriate filters in a Leica DMIRE2TCS SP2 confocal microscope (Nussloch, Germany). The lasers used were Ar 488 nm for green fluorescence, Ar/HeNe 543 nm for red fluorescence and finally ArUV 351 nm 364 nm for UV fluorescence. Primary antibodies used in immunocytochemistry were mouse anti-V5 (Invitrogen); mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma Aldrich); mouse anti-AU5 (Covance), and rabbit anti-HA (Abcam). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes). Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Total cellular RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Equal amounts (1 μg) of RNA from each treatment were reverse-transcribed (75 min, 42 °C), using 5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of 20 units of RNAsin (Promega). Semiquantitative PCR amplification of cDNA was performed in 25 μl of PCR buffer, containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.6 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Promega) and 15 pmol of each synthetic gene-specific primer for selected human phase II genes as well as human GSK-3β and murine Nrf2. To ensure that equal amounts of cDNA were added to the PCR, we amplified the β-actin housekeeping gene. After an initial denaturation step for 3 min at 94 °C, amplification of each cDNA was performed at the optimal number of cycles within linear range, using a thermal profile of 30 s at 94 °C (denaturalization), 30 at 58 °C (annealing), and 30 s at 72 °C (elongation). Table 1 shows the forward and reverse primers used for each gene analyzed, the size of the PCR fragment and the number of PCR cycles for amplification in the linear range. The amplified PCR products were resolved by 5% acrylamide/bisacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide.TABLE 1Genes, primers, and conditions for semiquantitative PCR amplificationGene productForward primerReverse primerFragment sizeCycles for linear rangeaLinear range was achieved with the indicated number of cycles using a 20-ng cDNA template and the thermal profile described under “Experimental Procedures”bpNrf25′–ATCCAGACAGACACCAGTGGATC–3′5′–GGCAGTGAAGACTGAACTTTCA–3′17920GSK-3β5′–TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGAT–3′5′–ACCCTGCCCAGGAGTTGCCAC–3′12030HO-15′–TGCTCAACATCCAGCTCTTTGA–3′5′–GCAGAATCTTGCACTTTGTTGCT–3′12030HO-25′–ATGGAGCTGCACCGGAAGGAG–3′5′–CTCCGGCTCGTTCTGCCCTAT–3′13030GSTA15′–CCTGCCTTTGAAAAAGTCTTAAAG–3′5′–AAGTTCCACCAGGTGAATGTCA–3′8632Gpx45′–CCGAAGTAAACTACACTCAGCTCGTC–3′5′–TTGATCTCTTCGTTACTCCCTGGC–3′12422GCL-M5′–GCTGTATCAGTGGGCACAG–3′5′–CGCTTGAATGTCAGGAATGC–3′19622NQO1bNQO1, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase5′–AGGCTGGTTTGAGCGAGT–3′5′–ATTGAATTCGGGCGTCTGCTG–3′26930β-Actin5′–TGTTTGAGACCTTCAACACC–3′5′–CGCTCATTGCCGATAGTGAT–3′20721a Linear range was achieved with the indicated number of cycles using a 20-ng cDNA template and the thermal profile described under “Experimental Procedures”b NQO1, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase Open table in a new tab GSH Levels—The levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) were determined using the GSH-sensitive probe monochlorobimane (Molecular Probes). 60,000 cells were seeded on 24-well plates and 16 h later, they were transfected as indicated. 200 μm l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO) was added to the medium and incubated for 24 h. During the last 6 h, cells were treated with 0.5 mm H2O2 as indicated in Fig. 8A. 100 μm monochlorobimane was added during the last hour. Plates were analyzed immediately using a Fluoroscan fluorometer (Labsystems Oy, Helsinki, Finland) (20-ms integration time, 355-nm excitation filter, and 485-nm emission filter). Basal autofluorescence was determined from cells that were not incubated with the probe and was subtracted to all samples. The background incorporation of the probe to -SH protein groups was subtracted from each sample with its corresponding BSO-treated GSH-depleted controls. LDH Levels—The levels of extracellular LDH were determined using the cytotoxicity detection kit of LDH (Roche Applied Science). 60,000 cells were seeded on 24-well plates and 16-h later, they were transfected as indicated. After 24 h, cells were treated with 0.5 mm H2O2 for 6 h as showed in Fig. 8B. Then, 100 μl per well of supernatant were carefully removed and transferred into corresponding wells of a 96-well micro-plate for determination of extracellular LDH levels. Then, the assay medium was removed from the adherent cells, and replaced with 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% Triton X-100. Again, 100 μl of supernatant from the lysed cells were transferred to a 96-well microplate for determination of intracellular LDH levels. To determine LDH activity 100 μl of reaction mixture were added to each sample and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Optical density was measured using a microplate reader (ELISA), at 490 nm and 600 nm. The fraction of extracellular LDH was represented as fold of increase over control untreated cells. Image Analysis, Quantification, and Statistics—Different band intensities corresponding to ethidium bromide detection of DNA samples or Western blot detection of protein samples were quantified using the Scion Image program. Student's t test was used to assess differences between groups. A p value < 0.001 was considered significant. Unless indicated, all experiments were performed at least three times with similar results. The values in the graphs correspond to the mean of at least three samples. Error bars indicate S.D. First, we set up the conditions to investigate phase II gene induction by the PI3K/Akt survival pathway using HO-1 as a model. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors for active, membrane-targeted versions of PI3K (PI3K-CAAX) and Akt1 (myr-Akt1), with an efficiency of transfection close to 90% (data not shown). HO-1 mRNA and protein levels were analyzed after 24 h from transfection. As shown in Fig. 1A, PI3K-CAAX- and myr-Akt1-transfected cells exhibited increased levels of Thr308-phosphorylated, active Akt. Interestingly, Akt activation correlated with increased HO-1 mRNA and protein levels"

We recently identified a nonselective cation channel, the NCCa-ATP channel, in ischemic astrocytes that is regulated by sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1), is opened by depletion of ATP and, when opened, causes cytotoxic edema. Here, we evaluated involvement of this channel in rodent models of stroke. SUR1 protein and mRNA were newly expressed in ischemic neurons, astrocytes and capillaries. Upregulation of SUR1 was linked to activation of the transcription factor Sp1 and was associated with expression of functional NCCa-ATP but not KATP channels. Block of SUR1 with low-dose glibenclamide reduced cerebral edema, infarct volume and mortality by 50%, with the reduction in infarct volume being associated with cortical sparing. Our findings indicate that the NCCa-ATP channel is crucially involved in development of cerebral edema, and that targeting SUR1 may provide a new therapeutic approach to stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2058734183,"Arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by tortuosity, elongation, stenosis and aneurysm formation in the major arteries owing to disruption of elastic fibers in the medial layer of the arterial wall. Previously, we used homozygosity mapping to map a candidate locus in a 4.1-Mb region on chromosome 20q13.1 (ref. 2). Here, we narrowed the candidate region to 1.2 Mb containing seven genes. Mutations in one of these genes, SLC2A10, encoding the facilitative glucose transporter GLUT10, were identified in six ATS families. GLUT10 deficiency is associated with upregulation of the TGFbeta pathway in the arterial wall, a finding also observed in Loeys-Dietz syndrome, in which aortic aneurysms associate with arterial tortuosity. The identification of a glucose transporter gene responsible for altered arterial morphogenesis is notable in light of the previously suggested link between GLUT10 and type 2 diabetes. Our data could provide new insight on the mechanisms causing microangiopathic changes associated with diabetes and suggest that therapeutic compounds intervening with TGFbeta signaling represent a new treatment strategy."

https://openalex.org/W2108175286,"d-Serine is a coagonist of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors that occurs at high levels in the brain. Biosynthesis of d-serine is carried out by serine racemase, which converts l-to d-serine. d-Serine has been demonstrated to occur in glial cells, leading to the proposal that astrocytes are the only source of d-serine. We now report significant amounts of serine racemase and d-serine in primary neuronal cultures and neurons in vivo. Several neuronal culture types expressed serine racemase, and d-serine synthesis was comparable with that in glial cultures. Immunohistochemical staining of brain sections with new antibodies revealed the presence of serine racemase and d-serine in neurons. Cortical neurons expressing serine racemase also expressed the NR2a subunit in situ. Neuron-derived d-serine contributes to NMDA receptor activation in cortical neuronal cultures. Degradation of endogenous d-serine by addition of the recombinant enzyme d-serine deaminase diminished NMDA-elicited excitotoxicity. Release of neuronal d-serine was mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptor agonists such as NMDA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid, and kainate. Removal of either external Ca2+ or Na+ blocked d-serine release. Release of d-serine was mostly through a cytosolic route because it was insensitive to bafilomycin A1, a potent inhibitor of vesicular neurotransmitter uptake. d-Serine was also not transported into purified synaptic vesicles under conditions optimal for the uptake of known transmitters.

Parsons A.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 597-664PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to glutamate, the NMDA receptor requires the obligatory binding of a coagonist of the NR1 subunit to mediate ion influx (2Johnson J.W. Ascher P. Nature. 1987; 325: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (2605) Google Scholar). Although glycine was originally suggested as the NMDA receptor coagonist, recent data indicate that endogenous d-serine is a physiologically relevant NMDA receptor ligand at the coagonist site. d-Serine is present at high levels in the brain, with little levels in peripheral tissues (3Hashimoto A. Nishikawa T. Hayashi T. Fujii N. Harada K. Oka T. Takahashi K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 4Hashimoto A. Nishikawa T. Oka T. Takahashi K. J.

Destruction of endogenous d-serine by d-amino-acid oxidase in hippocampal cultures promotes a decrease in NMDA receptor responses (6Mothet J.P. Parent A.T. Wolosker H. Brady Jr., R.O. Linden D.J.

Likewise, NMDA receptor-mediated responses in the retina and induction of long-term hippocampal potentiation are also diminished by removing d-serine (7Yang Y. Ge W. Chen Y. Zhang Z. Shen W. Wu C.

Very recently, d-serine was shown to be required for granule cell migration in the developing cerebellum (9Kim P.M. Aizawa H. Kim P.S. Huang A.S. Wickramasinghe S.R. Kashani A.H. Barrow R.K.

It has been proposed that Bergman glial cells release d-serine and enhance cell migration through activation of NMDA receptors in migrating granule cells (9Kim P.M. Aizawa H. Kim P.S. Huang A.S.

In hippocampal organotypic slice cultures, endogenous d-serine was shown to be the dominant coagonist for NMDA receptor-elicited neurotoxicity, mediating virtually all cell death elicited by NMDA (10Shleper M.

De Miranda J. Wolosker H. Brain Res. 2002; 929: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that d-serine released from astrocytes that ensheath the synapse will stimulate nearby neuronal NMDA receptors (16Schell M.J. Molliver M.E. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3948-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar).The evidence that d-serine possesses a target receptor as well as a biosynthetic and degradative apparatus implies that d-serine is an important transmitter/neuromodulator in the brain (5Wolosker H. Panizzutti R. De Miranda J. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 41: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19Snyder S.H. Ferris C.D. Am. J. Psychiatry. 2000; 157: 1738-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the glial localization of d-serine is not compatible with the classical definition of neurotransmitter, which should be present in neurons. We have explored a possible neuronal localization of d-serine and serine racemase utilizing biochemical methods in cell cultures and new antibodies against d-serine and serine racemase. We demonstrate the unambiguous presence of serine racemase and d-serine in neurons. Neuronal release of d-serine mediates a significant fraction of NMDA-elicited excitotoxicity in cortical cultures. Our data indicate that neuronal d-serine may play an important role in NMDA receptor activation, such as occurs in neurotoxicity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—l-Serine and d-serine were purchased from Bachem. Acetonitrile, AMPA, trans-(±)-1-amino-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid, bafilomycin A1, DNase I, anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and anti-microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2) monoclonal antibodies, l-glutamate, glycine, imidazole, kainate, a lactic dehydrogenase-based in vitro toxicology assay kit, NADH, NMDA, propidium iodide, tetrahydrofuran, and tetrodotoxin were obtained from Sigma. 6,7-Dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione and dizocilpine (MK-801) were purchased from Tocris. Anti-NeuN (neuron-specific nuclear protein) monoclonal antibody was obtained from Chemicon International, Inc. Anti-actin monoclonal antibody was from MP Bioscience. Basal Eagle's medium, minimal essential medium, fetal bovine serum, glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, trypsin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor were obtained from Biological Industries (Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel). B-27 supplement and diaminobenzidine were obtained from Invitrogen. d-[G-3H]Serine was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and l-[G-3H]glutamate was from Amersham Biosciences. Other reagents were analytical grade.Cell Cultures—Animals were killed by quick decapitation. Serum-free neuronal cultures from the cerebral cortex and striatum were prepared from day 16–18 embryos, and hippocampal cultures were obtained from postnatal day (P) 1 Sprague-Dawley rats as described (20Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. After dissection, cortices from 12 embryos were suspended in 1.5 ml of HEPES-buffered salt solution (HBSS) lacking calcium and magnesium (10 mm HEPES, 1 mm pyruvate, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.18 mm NaH2PO4, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, and 137 mm NaCl) and digested for 7 min at 37 °C with trypsin at a final concentration of 0.12%. Then, soybean trypsin inhibitor and 400 units of DNase I were added, and the tissue was mechanically dissociated with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. After adding HBSS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ (10 mm HEPES, 1 mm pyruvate, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.18 mm NaH2PO4, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, 137 mm NaCl, 0.9 mm MgCl2, and 1.1 mm CaCl2) to the suspension and decanting tissue clumps, the cells were plated in poly-d-lysine-coated 12-well plates (Nunc) at a density of 2.2 × 106 cells/well. For immunocytochemistry, the cells were seeded on acid-washed glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine (0.2–1 mg/ml). The culture medium consisted of basal Eagle's medium supplemented with B-27, 0.4 mm glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. For d-serine synthesis experiments, the cultures were used 4–10 days after plating. The culture medium employed did not contain any l-serine, d-serine, or glycine. To obtain mixed neuronal/glial cultures, 2–5% fetal bovine serum was added to the medium described above, and the cultures were used 10 days after plating. Nearly pure glial cultures were prepared by supplementing the medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and vigorously washing the cells with HBSS four to five times every 2 days to dislodge neuronal cells and microglia. Glial cultures were used 10–14 days after plating. Granule cell cultures, mixed neuronal/glial cultures, and glial cultures of the cerebellum were prepared as described above, except that they were obtained from P2–4 Sprague-Dawley pups.Determination of Endogenous d-Serine—An aliquot (0.1 ml) of the culture medium was removed, and the samples were processed for HPLC as described (15De Miranda J. Panizzutti R. Foltyn V.N. Wolosker H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14542-14547Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were first deproteinized by addition of trichloroacetic acid to a 5% final concentration. The suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was analyzed by HPLC after removal of trichloroacetic acid by four extractions with water-saturated diethyl ether. Because the culture medium contained peaks that ran close to d-serine and sometimes obscured it, all samples were routinely treated with the d-serine deaminase DsdA (EC 4.3.1.18) to confirm d-serine levels and positions in the HPLC chromatogram. l-Serine employed in d-serine synthesis experiments was treated with d-amino-acid oxidase to remove contaminant d-serine as described previously (15De Miranda J. Panizzutti R. Foltyn V.N. Wolosker H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14542-14547Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).Antibody Production and Western Blotting—Full-length mouse serine racemase was prepared as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in mammalian cells as described previously (21Panizzutti R. De Miranda J. Ribeiro C.S. Engelender S. Wolosker H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and used to immunize rabbits. The antibody designated Ab2 was purified on a cyanogen bromide column (22Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 343-345Google Scholar) coupled to 1 mg of recombinant full-length mouse serine racemase that was bacterially expressed and purified as described previously (14Foltyn V.N. Bendikov I. De Miranda J. Panizzutti R. Dumin E. Shleper M. Li P. Toney M.D. Kartvelishvily E. Wolosker H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1754-1763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The antibody against serine racemase designated Ab1 was generated and characterized in a previous study (13Wolosker H. Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13409-13414Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Except when indicated otherwise, all blots were carried out with antibody Ab2. For Western blotting, the purified antibodies were used at 0.15–0.5 μg/ml, and the blots were revealed with SuperSignal West Dura extended duration substrate (Pierce).Immunocytochemistry and Cell Counts—Cultured cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated with 0.5 μg/ml affinity-purified anti-serine racemase antibody Ab2. Controls were carried out by pre-absorption of the antibody with 10 μg of purified antigen. Anti-rabbit Cy3 and anti-mouse Cy2 secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were used. Co-localization with neuronal and glial markers (MAP2 (1:100 dilution) and GFAP (1:1000 dilution), respectively) was analyzed by confocal laser microscopy. For determination of the percentage of glial cell in the different cultures, GFAP-positive cells were counted in several random fields. Total cell number in each field was determined by counting cell nuclei stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.Immunohistochemistry for Serine Racemase—For serine racemase staining, Sprague-Dawley rats at P7 or 30 were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and perfused with phosphate-buffered saline to remove the blood. Then, the perfusion solution was switched to 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), and brains were cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) plus 5 mm sodium azide. Brain sagittal sections were cut on a cryostat (10 μm) and affixed to slides. Blocking medium contained 10% normal goat serum and 0.05% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl). Purified anti-serine racemase antibody Ab2 was used at 0.5–1 μg/ml; and in some experiments, immune serum was used at 1:600 dilution in fresh blocking medium. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the slides were washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 250 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Triton X-100. Staining was developed using biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody (1:200 dilution) with diaminobenzidine as the peroxidase substrate (Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories).For double-labeling immunofluorescence, the sections were processed and blocked as described above, and the primary antibodies used were anti-NeuN (1:200 dilution) and anti-NR2a (50 μg/ml; Zymed Laboratories Inc.) monoclonal antibodies and anti-serine racemase immune serum (1:600 dilution, Ab2). NeuN was revealed by applying anti-mouse Cy3 antibody at 1 μg/ml, and serine racemase was revealed by applying biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody (1:600 dilution), followed by fluorescein linked to avidin D (1μg/ml; Vector Laboratories). The slides were observed under a fluorescence inverted microscope.Immunohistochemistry for d-Serine—For d-serine staining, the original protocol (16Schell M.J. Molliver M.E. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl.

After perfusion with phosphate-buffered saline, Sprague-Dawley rats at P9 were perfused with 5% glutaraldehyde, 0.5% paraformaldehyde, and 0.2% sodium metabisulfite in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) and cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) plus 5 mm sodium azide. Brain sagittal sections were cut on a cryostat or freezing microtome. We used sections of 10 μm instead of 40 μm because they gave lower background staining and higher specific immunoreactivity. Free-floating sections were reduced with TBS containing 0.5% NaBH4 and 0.2% sodium metabisulfite for 10 min. After washing, the sections were affixed to slides. Sections were blocked and permeabilized with 10% normal goat serum and 0.05% Triton X-100 in TBS for 45 min. Then, the sections were incubated for 24–48 h with rabbit anti-d-serine antibody (1:200–600 dilution; MoBiTec) or the anti-d-serine antibody employed previously by Schell et al. (16Schell M.J. Molliver M.E. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3948-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar) at 1:200 dilution. Incubation was carried out at 4 °C in TBS containing 10% normal goat serum, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mm l-serine-glutaraldehyde conjugate to block any cross-reactivity against l-serine. We avoided using a higher l-serine-glutaraldehyde conjugate concentration because commercial l-serine contains contaminant d-serine that might decrease the specific staining as well. Biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody was used at 1:200 dilution in 2% normal goat serum and 0.05% Triton X-100 in TBS. Staining was revealed using the peroxidase Elite ABC kit with diaminobenzidine as the substrate. Controls were carried out by pre-absorbing the primary antibody with 0.5 mm d-serine-glutaraldehyde conjugate. In some experiments, free-floating staining for d-serine was carried out in thick sections (40 μm) using the same technique and antibody employed in previous studies (16Schell M.J. Molliver M.E. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3948-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 23Schell M.J. Brady Jr., R.O. Molliver M.E. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1604-1615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Double-labeling experiments for d-serine and NeuN were carried out in rats perfused with 3% glutaraldehyde (instead of 5%) to preserve the immunoreactivity against NeuN and to decrease the background fluorescence. This lower glutaraldehyde concentration was highly effective for d-serine fixation, as trichloroacetic acid extraction of the free amino acids from 3% glutaraldehyde-fixed brains released <5% of the total d-serine compared with unfixed tissue. Sagittal sections (10 μm) were cut using a cryostat. Schiff's reagent was employed to quench the back-ground glutaraldehyde fluorescence as described previously (24Tagliaferro P. Tandler C.J. Ramos A.J. Saavedra J. Pecci Brusco A. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1997; 77: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Schiff's reagent (25De Tomasi J.A. Stain Technol. 1936; 11: 137-144Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was prepared by dissolving 1 g of pararosaniline hydrochloride in 200 ml of boiling water. After cooling to 50 °C, the solution was filtered and acidified by addition of HCl to 0.1 m. After the solution was allowed to cool to 25 °C,1gof sodium metabisulfite was added, and the solution was left in the dark for 24 h. Then, the solution was filtered after addition of2gof activated charcoal and stored in darkness for no more than 5 days at 4 °C. Free-floating sections were immersed in Schiff's reagent and incubated at room temperature under darkness for 20 min. Then, excess reagent was removed by washing with 0.1 m HCl containing 0.5% sodium metabisulfite. The sections were reduced with TBS containing 0.5% NaBH4 and 0.2% sodium metabisulfite for 10 min and affixed to slides after washing with TBS. Blocking was carried out as described above, and anti-NeuN (1:200 dilution) and anti-d-serine (1:400–1000 dilution; MoBiTec) monoclonal antibodies were incubated for 48 h at 4 °C. NeuN was revealed by applying anti-mouse Cy3 antibody at 1 μg/ml, and serine racemase was revealed by applying biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody (1:600 dilution), followed by fluorescein linked to avidin D at 1 μg/ml.Subcellular Fractionation—Intact brain nuclei were purified as described previously (26Giuffrida A.M. Cambria A. Serra I. Avitabile M. Ital. J. Biochem. (Engl. Ed.). 1975; 24: 288-307PubMed Google Scholar), with some modifications. Adult rat brain homogenates were prepared with a loose homogenizer in 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2,1mm potassium Pi (pH 6.4), 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml chymostatin. Then, the suspension was filtered through 70-μm mesh nylon. The crude nuclear fraction (P1) was obtained by centrifugation for 10 min at 850 × g. Purified nuclei were obtained by applying the washed P1 fraction to a 2 m sucrose cushion as described (26Giuffrida A.M. Cambria A. Serra I. Avitabile M. Ital. J. Biochem. (Engl. Ed.). 1975; 24: 288-307PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain cytosolic protein (S3 fraction), the homogenate was centrifuged for 1 h at 120,000 × g, and the pellet was discarded.Recombinant DsdA—DsdA from E. coli strain CFT073 containing an N-terminal histidine tag was expressed as described previously (10Shleper M. Kartvelishvily E. Wolosker H. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9413-9417Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein was induced by addition of 0.8 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and affinity-purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads. After extensive washing in buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and 10 mm imidazole, the protein was eluted with 150 mm imidazole and dialyzed overnight against phosphate-buffered saline. The protein was concentrated to 30–40 mg/ml with Centriprep (Amicon) and frozen at –70 °C until used. The purity of each batch of DsdA was virtually 100% as analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Deamination of d-serine into pyruvate by DsdA was monitored by decreases in NADH at 340 nm as the pyruvate was converted to lactate by added lactate dehydrogenase.NMDA-elicited Neurotoxicity—After 10–15 days in culture, the medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with HEPES control salt solution (HCSS) lacking magnesium (20 mm HEPES, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 15 mm glucose, 5.4 mm KCl, and 120 mm NaCl) and exposed to 100–500 μm NMDA in the same medium for 20 min. Then, cells were washed twice with HCSS, and the original culture medium was returned. Cell death was monitored after 24 h by the release of lactate dehydrogenase using the lactic dehydrogenase-based in vitro toxicology assay kit. To destroy endogenous d-serine, 20–50 μg/ml DsdA was added to the culture medium for 20–60 min and was also present in the HCSS medium in which NMDA stimulation was carried out. To evaluate the percentage of cell death caused by NMDA, total lactate dehydrogenase was measured after cell lysis.d-Serine Release—Neuronal cultures were labeled with 10 μm d-[3H]serine (100,000 cpm/nmol d-serine) during a 20–40-min incubation in HBSS. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold HBSS. Then, cells were exposed to HCSS lacking magnesium for 5–7 min at room temperature with several drugs in triplicates. The radioactivity released was counted. The values were corrected for total protein in each well. To evaluate the total d-[3H]serine taken up, HBSS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 was added, and the radioactivity released was counted. Typically, no more than 7–10% d-serine was released. No significant metabolism of d-serine was observed throughout the experiment monitored as by HPLC analysis. Statistical analysis was carried out by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Tukey's post hoc test.Neurotransmitter Uptake into Synaptic Vesicles—Synaptic vesicles were purified from rat cerebral cortex as described previously (27Hell J.W. Maycox P.R. Stadler H. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3023-3029Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) by omitting chromatography on glass beads (28Wolosker H. de Souza D.O. de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11726-11731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The vesicles were stored in liquid nitrogen until used. The reaction medium contained 10 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 7.4), 4 mm KCl, 150 mm sucrose, and 50 μm l-glutamate or d-serine. l-[G-3H]Glutamate and d-[G-3H]serine were added at 4 μCi/ml. Uptake was started by addition of 4 mm MgATP, and the reaction was stopped after 10 min at 37 °C by filtration through 0.45-μm Millipore filters (100 μg of protein/filter). The filters were quickly flushed with 50 ml of cold MOPS/Tris (pH 7.4) solution. Glutamate uptake was corrected for the nonspecific binding measured in the absence of ATP. The specificity of uptake was checked by addition of 1 μm bafilomycin A1. Radioactivity was counted in a liquid scintillation counter.RESULTSd-Serine Synthesis and Serine Racemase in Neurons—To evaluate the possibility that d-serine may also be present at significant levels in neurons, we prepared prenatal neuronal cultures containing minimal amounts of glia using medium lacking serum and monitored d-serine levels by HPLC (Fig. 1A). In the absence of l-serine, practically no d-serine accumulated in nearly pure neuronal cultures of the cortex (Fig. 1A). Addition of 2 mm l-serine led to the accumulation of micromolar amounts of d-serine in the culture medium, reaching steady state after 6 days (Fig. 1A). This is compatible with the role of serine racemase, which produces d-serine from l-serine (13Wolosker H. Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13409-13414Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). As demonstrated previously for astrocytic cultures (14Foltyn V.N. Bendikov I. De Miranda J. Panizzutti R. Dumin E. Shleper M. Li P. Toney M.D. Kartvelishvily E. Wolosker H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1754-1763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), the majority of the total d-serine produced in cortical neuronal cultures accumulated in the culture medium (data not shown).To examine whether formation of d-serine was due to contamination of the neuronal culture by glia, we prepared different cortical cultures and monitored the number of glial cells by GFAP staining (Fig. 1B). Our prenatal cortical neuronal cultures cont"

https://openalex.org/W2095777706,"Hsp90 is a highly abundant chaperone whose clientele includes hundreds of cellular proteins, many of which are central players in key signal transduction pathways and the majority of which are protein kinases. In light of the variety of Hsp90 clientele, the mechanism of selectivity of the chaperone toward its client proteins is a major open question. Focusing on human kinases, we have demonstrated that the chaperone recognizes a common surface in the amino-terminal lobe of kinases from diverse families, including two newly identified clients, NFκB-inducing kinase and death-associated protein kinase, and the oncoprotein HER2/ErbB-2. Surface electrostatics determine the interaction with the Hsp90 chaperone complex such that introduction of a negative charge within this region disrupts recognition. Compiling information on the Hsp90 dependence of 105 protein kinases, including 16 kinases whose relationship to Hsp90 is first examined in this study, reveals that surface features, rather than a contiguous amino acid sequence, define the capacity of the Hsp90 chaperone machine to recognize client kinases. Analyzing Hsp90 regulation of two major signaling cascades, the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, leads us to propose that the selectivity of the chaperone to specific kinases is functional, namely that Hsp90 controls kinases that function as hubs integrating multiple inputs. These lessons bear significance to pharmacological attempts to target the chaperone in human pathologies, such as cancer.

Morimoto R.I. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) unique in the diverse but select nature of its client proteins. Hsp90 clients range from protein kinases through steroid hormone receptors and small G proteins to viral enzymes and components of the telomerase (2Neckers L. Ivy S.P. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2003; 15: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 3Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). The breadth of Hsp90 clientele has been addressed recently in comprehensive studies in yeast (4Millson S.H. Truman A.W. King V. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Piper P.W. Eukaryotic Cell. 2005; 4: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 5Zhao R. Davey M. Hsu Y.C. Kaplanek P. Tong A. Parsons A.B. Krogan N. Cagney G. Mai D. Greenblatt J. Boone C. Emili A. Houry W.A. Cell. 2005; 120: 715-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), demonstrating that roughly 10% of the yeast proteome is subject to regulation by Hsp90. The common denominator of Hsp90 clients is their essential role in the propagation of signal transduction. Because many different regulatory proteins depend on Hsp90, multiple signaling pathways are sensitive to changes in its activity (6Zhang H. Burrows F. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 488-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Hsp90 controls the biogenesis, stability, and activity of its client proteins. The role of the chaperone in maintenance of the stability of its clients is reflected by enhanced degradation of the clients upon pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 by ansamycin antibiotics, such as geldanamycin (GA). The function of Hsp90 during the biogenesis of client proteins (7Richter K. Buchner J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) is such that the chaperone is essential for the maturation of the majority of its client proteins to an activation-competent state, as established early on for the Src kinase. Thus, in most cells examined, Src engages in a stable complex with the Hsp90 machinery, as long as the protein is cytosolic, but dissociates from the Hsp90-Cdc37 complex as soon as it reaches the plasma membrane (8Brugge J.S. Darrow D. Lipsich L.A. Yonemoto W. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1983; 119: 135-147PubMed Google Scholar, 9Courtneidge S.A. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7117-7121Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Hsp90 is also implicated in the regulation of the signaling capacity of client proteins (10Citri A. Gan J. Mosesson Y. Vereb G. Szollosi J. Yarden Y. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 11Donze O. Abbas-Terki T. Picard D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3771-3780Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Consistently, Hsp90 has been found to interact with the effector domain of its client proteins (e.g. the hormone-binding domain of steroid hormone receptors and the catalytic domain of kinases). Interestingly, large variability can be found in the regulation of individual members of protein families by Hsp90. Thus, the chaperone selectively establishes a stable interaction with individual members of the family of steroid hormone receptors (3Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar), Cyclin-dependent kinases (12Stepanova L. Leng X. Parker S.B. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1491-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), Src kinases (13Bijlmakers M.J. Marsh M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1585-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), as well as ErbB family receptor tyrosine kinases (14Citri A. Alroy I. Lavi S. Rubin C. Xu W. Grammatikakis N. Patterson C. Neckers L. Fry D.W. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2407-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 15Xu W. Mimnaugh E. Rosser M.F. Nicchitta C. Marcu M. Yarden Y. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3702-3708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The interaction of Hsp90 with its client proteins is thought to be characterized by low-affinity binding and repeated cycles of association and release (16Smith D.F. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that, rather than recognizing specific sequence motifs, Hsp90 interacts with features that are common to unstable proteins, such as unveiled hydrophobic patches, with a higher level of specificity being gained through the mediation of specific co-chaperones, such as the kinase-dedicated CDC37 (17Riggs D. Cox M. Cheung-Flynn J. Prapapanich V. Carrigan P. Smith D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 39: 279-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the mechanism by which Hsp90 recognizes its diverse clientele remains a primary question in the field. The specificity of Hsp90 toward its client proteins has mainly been addressed for steroid hormone receptors and kinases. In the case of the glucocorticoid receptor, a small (7-amino-acid) sequence in the amino terminus of the hormone-binding cleft was found to be crucial for recognition by Hsp90 (18Xu M. Dittmar K.D. Giannoukos G. Pratt W.B. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13918-13924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Regarding kinases, work carried out on the Lck kinase demonstrated that the amino-terminal lobe of the kinase mediates the bulk of interactions with CDC37 and Hsp90, with a major contribution associated with the hinge region between the two lobes of the kinase (19Prince T. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39975-39981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Scroggins B.T. Prince T. Shao J. Uma S. Huang W. Guo Y. Yun B.G. Hedman K. Matts R.L. Hartson S.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12550-12561Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Similar to Src family kinases, ErbB-2/HER2 is strongly coupled to Hsp90, and parallel studies have converged on a discrete region within the kinase domain of ErbB-2 that confers interactions with Hsp90 (10Citri A. Gan J. Mosesson Y. Vereb G. Szollosi J. Yarden Y. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 21Tikhomirov O. Carpenter G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 39-43PubMed Google Scholar, 22Xu W. Yuan X. Xiang Z. Mimnaugh E. Marcu M. Neckers L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Initial deletion analysis indicates that the kinase domain of ErbB-2 is responsible for the interaction with Hsp90 (15Xu W. Mimnaugh E. Rosser M.F. Nicchitta C. Marcu M. Yarden Y. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3702-3708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), whereas use of a kinase-inhibitory analog of ATP suggests that this interaction is affected by the occupation of the nucleotide-binding pocket of ErbB-2 (14Citri A. Alroy I. Lavi S. Rubin C. Xu W. Grammatikakis N. Patterson C. Neckers L. Fry D.W. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2407-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Unlike ErbB-2, ErbB-1 interacts only weakly with Hsp90 and CDC37. Upon swapping sequences between ErbB-1 and ErbB-2, it was found that a loop connecting the αC helix to the β4 strand within the amino-terminal lobe of the kinase domain mediates the enhanced sensitivity of ErbB-2 to degradation induced by GA (21Tikhomirov O. Carpenter G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 39-43PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis within this region demonstrated that the interactions of ErbB-2 with Hsp90 are mediated by the respective surface (22Xu W. Yuan X. Xiang Z. Mimnaugh E. Marcu M. Neckers L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 23Citri A. Kochupurakkal B.S. Yarden Y. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and revealed a role for Hsp90 in regulating the activity of ErbB receptors by limiting receptor heterodimerization (10Citri A. Gan J. Mosesson Y. Vereb G. Szollosi J. Yarden Y. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have addressed the features conferring recognition of protein kinases by Hsp90. Revisiting the role of the αC-β4 loop of ErbB-2, we further established that surface electrostatics define the capacity of the kinase to be recognized by Hsp90. Applying this observation to two novel Hsp90 client kinases, NIK and DAPK, we have confirmed that their interactions with the chaperone are dependent on surface electrostatics within the αC-β4 loop. Addressing the potential to define a Hsp90 interaction motif sequence within kinase clients, we carried out a kinome-scale experimental and bioinformatic analysis of the selectivity of Hsp90 toward kinase clients and concluded that a combination of surface features, rather than a linear amino acid sequence, defines recognition by the Hsp90 chaperone. Last, addressing the functional selectivity of the Hsp90 chaperone machine, we have found that hubs within signal transduction cascades are preferred nodes of regulation by the chaperone. Reagents and Plasmids—Unless otherwise indicated, materials were purchased from Sigma. GA and 17-AAG were a kind gift from Kosan Biosciences (Hayward, CA). 35S-labeled cysteine and methionine was from GE-Healthcare (Buckinghamshire, UK). Anti-Hsp90 antibodies were from Stressgen (San Diego, CA), anti-HA from Babco (Basel, Switzerland), anti-epidermal growth factor receptor from Alexis (Montreal, Canada), anti-Myc from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-ErbB-2 monoclonal antibodies were generated in our laboratory. Construction of Mammalian Expression Vectors—Point mutations within the kinase domains of ErbB-1, ErbB-2, NIK, and DAPK were generated by PCR mutagenesis using the Pfu-Turbo enzyme (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). An expression vector encoding HA-tagged ubiquitin was a gift from Prof. Dirk Bohmann (University of Rochester, NY). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293T and COS7 cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, whereas Chinese hamster ovary cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Biological Industries, Beit-Haemek, Israel). All media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Transfection of HEK293T cells was performed using the calcium phosphate method. COS7 cells were transfected using JET-PEI (Qbiogene, Irvine, CA), and Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Lysate Preparation, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblot Analyses—For analysis of protein-protein interactions, cells were lysed in solubilization buffer (50 mm sodium-HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2) containing Na3VO4 and a mixture of protease inhibitors. Otherwise, radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium-deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.1% SDS0) was used. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 15 min). For direct electrophoretic analysis, boiling gel sample buffer was added to cell lysates. For other experiments, lysates were first subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-receptor monoclonal antibodies that were precoupled to rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin G beads by tumbling for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with the lysis buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE through 10% gels, and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked for 0.5 h in TBST buffer (0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 10% low-fat milk, probed with 1 μg/ml primary antibodies for 2 h, followed by 0.5 μg/ml secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive bands were detected with the ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) reagent (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Structural Analysis—The kinase domain of ErbB-2 was modeled based on the available x-ray structure of the kinase domain of ErbB-1 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1M14) (24Berman H.M. Westbrook J.

The fractional solvent-accessible area (amino acid surface exposure) was calculated using the InsightII software package (Accelrys Inc.). Hsp90 Interactions with ErbB Kinases Are Sensitive to Surface Charge within the αC-β4 Loop—We previously reported that a drug designed to covalently attach to cysteine 805 located within the kinase domain of ErbB-2 increased receptor ubiquitylation (14Citri A. Alroy I. Lavi S. Rubin C. Xu W. Grammatikakis N. Patterson C. Neckers L. Fry D.W. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2407-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The mechanism we inferred involves dissociation of Hsp90-ErbB-2 complexes, an effect observed also upon treatment with the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin. Based upon the identification of a sequence motif responsible for ErbB-2 sensitivity to GA (21Tikhomirov O. Carpenter G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 39-43PubMed Google Scholar), we identified the αC-β4 loop of ErbB-2 as a recognition site for the Hsp90 complex (10Citri A. Gan J. Mosesson Y. Vereb G. Szollosi J. Yarden Y. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), a finding confirmed by another group (22Xu W. Yuan X. Xiang Z. Mimnaugh E. Marcu M. Neckers L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In an attempt to gain further understanding of the structural basis for kinase recognition by Hsp90, we addressed the differential sensitivity of the four ErbB proteins to degradation induced by the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG (Fig. 1A). We chose to compare the levels of endogenous kinases following treatment for short (2 and 4 h) or long (18 and 24 h) incubation periods with the drug. Degradation of ErbB-1 and -2 was addressed in COS7 cells, which express relatively high levels of ErbB-1, whereas degradation of ErbB-2, -3, and -4 was addressed in MCF7 cells, which express detectable levels of the receptors but scarcely detectable ErbB-1. Although the degradation of ErbB-1 was relatively slow, rapid degradation of ErbB-2 was observed in both cell lines. In addition, we observed slow degradation of ErbB-3 and -4, consistent with previous reports (27Tikhomirov O. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26625-26631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 28Zheng F.F. Kuduk S.D. Chiosis G. Munster P.N. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Danishefsky S.J. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2090-2094PubMed Google Scholar). Alignment of the αC-β4 loop region of ErbB-1 and -2, as well as the comparison of surface charge maps within this region from the published structure of ErbB-1 (PDB code 1M14) (25Stamos J. Sliwkowski M.X. Eigenbrot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46265-46272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar), upon which we modeled ErbB-2, revealed remarkable differences in surface charge between ErbB-1 and -2 (Fig. 1B). These differences are mainly attributed to a single amino acid (Asp-770 in ErbB-1 and Gly-778 in ErbB-2), which confers a significant negative charge to ErbB-1 in this region (Fig. 1B). The overall surface charge on the backside of the kinase domain of ErbB-1, where the αC-β4 loop is located (Fig. 1C), is characterized by a mainly neutral/positive surface charge, with the exception of the aspartic acid within the αC-β4 loop. Analyzing the surface exposure of residues within this loop, we found that the aspartic acid, as well as an adjacent proline, are the most highly surface-exposed residues within this sequence. Swapping glycine 778 in ErbB-2 with an aspartate (as in ErbB-1; mutant denoted G778D) stabilized the receptor toward 17-AAG-induced ubiquitylation/degradation and enhanced the kinase activity of the receptor dramatically, consistent with loss of regulation by Hsp90 (Fig. 1D) (10Citri A. Gan J. Mosesson Y. Vereb G. Szollosi J. Yarden Y. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The reverse mutation of aspartate to glycine on ErbB-1 (mutant denoted D770G) resulted in the opposite effect (Fig. 1E). In addition, D770G-ErbB-1 was found in a 17-AAG-sensitive association with Hsp90 and associated strongly with CDC37, hallmarks of Hsp90 regulation (Fig. 1, F and G). In conclusion, the surface charge in the region of the αC-β4 loop of ErbB-1, conferred by the presence of a surface-exposed aspartic acid, is a major contributing factor to the reduced dependence of ErbB-1 upon Hsp90. This conclusion is consistent with observations made by Neckers and collaborators (22Xu W. Yuan X. Xiang Z. Mimnaugh E. Marcu M. Neckers L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The Novel Hsp90 Client Kinases NIK and DAPK Interact with Hsp90 through Their αC-β4 Loop—The occurrence of a specific protein fold with distinct surface features defining the differential extent of recognition of ErbB-1 and -2 by Hsp90 suggests the potential for uncovering a general Hsp90 recognition element. In line with this notion, a short motif conferring Hsp90 dependence has been previously described for the glucocorticoid receptor (18Xu M. Dittmar K.D. Giannoukos G. Pratt W.B. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13918-13924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Alignment of the motif sequences of the glucocorticoid receptor, ErbB-1, and -2 (Fig. 2A) demonstrates similar proline-centered hinges (19Prince T. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39975-39981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Giannoukos G. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36527-36536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Genome-wide screens of all human proteins carried out based on this alignment did not bear statistical significance (data not shown). Therefore, we focused on kinases from different families whose sequence characteristics within the region of the αC-β4 loop were similar to those of ErbB-2. The kinases chosen were death-associated protein kinase (DAPK; CAMK family), a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent, cytoskeletal-associated protein kinase whose expression is implicated in the sensitivity of cells to apoptotic effects of tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ; and NFκB-inducing kinase (NIK; MAP3K14, STE family), an essential component of the “alternative” NFκB activation pathway. Addressing the regulation of DAPK by Hsp90, we found that degradation of endogenous DAPK was induced following inhibition of Hsp90 by 17-AAG (see supplemental table). Co-immunoprecipitation of Hsp90 demonstrated that DAPK forms a 17-AAG-sensitive complex with Hsp90 (Fig. 2B, top). When addressing the three DAPK family members, it was observed that all members (DAPK, DAPK2/ZIPK, and DAPK3/Drp1) interact with Hsp90 and undergo degradation following long periods of incubation with 17-AAG (supplemental table and data not shown). Immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged constructs of DAPK and immunoblotting for Hsp90 verified that the kinase domain of DAPK is necessary and sufficient to mediate interactions with Hsp90 (Fig. 2B, bottom). Thus, deletion of the kinase domain (mutant denoted “-KD”) abolished Hsp90 interactions, whereas the kinase domain in isolation (KD) was sufficient to mediate the interaction. Examining the structure of the kinase domain of DAPK, we observed that the surface around the αC-β4 loop of the kinase is characterized by an abundance of neutral or positively charged amino acids, with similar distribution of surface exposure of the residues within the loop, as observed for ErbB-1 (Fig. 2C). Utilizing the isolated kinase domain of DAPK, we addressed the effect of introducing a negative charge within the αC-β4 loop on the dependence of the kinase upon Hsp90. Replacing either of two surface-exposed amino acids with acidic residues (Q72D or P74E) resulted in reduction in the sensitivity of the kinase to degradation induced by inhibition of Hsp90 (Fig. 2D), whereas replacement of the proline with an alanine (P74A) exerted no effect. Combining the negative charges in both positions had a weak additive effect on the disruption of Hsp90 dependence of the kinase (Fig. 2D). In addition, the double mutant displayed reduced interactions with the chaperone, as assayed by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2E). The capacity of DAPK to interact with CDC37 (Fig. 2F) was also sensitive to the introduction of a negative charge within the αC-β4 loop (Fig. 2G). Addressing the regulation of NIK by Hsp90, we followed the degradation of the protein upon treatment of cells with 17-AAG (Fig. 3, A and B) as well as its interactions with Hsp90 (Fig. 3C). These analyses identified NIK as a novel Hsp90 client in line with recent proteomic mapping of interactions within the NFκB pathway (30Bouwmeester T. Bauch A. Ruffner H. Angrand P.O. Bergamini G. Croughton K. Cruciat C. Eberhard D. Gagneur J. Ghidelli S. Hopf C. Huhse B. Mangano R. Michon A.M. Schirle M. Schlegl J. Schwab M. Stein M.A. Bauer A. Casari G. Drewes G. Gavin A.C. Jackson D.B. Joberty G. Neubauer G. Rick J. Kuster B. Superti-Furga G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Further, introduction of an aspartate within the αC-β4 loop and replacement of the flanking proline with a glutamic acid inhibited 17-AAG-induced degradation of NIK (Fig. 3B) and reduced interactions with Hsp90 (Fig. 3C). Likewise, we observed stable NIK-CDC37 interactions (Fig. 3D), which were disrupted by the introduction of a negative charge within the αC-β4 loop (Fig. 3E). Hsp90 Recognizes a Well Defined Surface Common to Kinase Clients, rather than a Linear Sequence Motif—To gain insight into the mechanism of recognition of client kinases by Hsp90, we expanded our dataset of Hsp90 clients. Utilizing COS7 cells treated with 17-AAG, we examined the degradation of a large number of both closely and distantly related kinases (see summary of our results in the supplemental table). This analysis added the kinases Epha2, Yes, Pyk2, Cdk2, Rsk1, and Msk1 to the list of clients based on their destabilization upon treatment of cells with 17-AAG. The list of non-clients was also expanded, adding the kinases Tec, Erk3, Erk5, Mek5, Mek1, and βPak. Additionally, we compiled available data from the literature relating to the regulation of kinases by Hsp90 and verified the data for >30 additional kinases (see supplemental table). Assuming a common structure-based mechanism, we grouped all kinases for which interactions with Hsp90 or 17-AAG/GA-induced degradation have been reported. In this way, all four ErbB proteins are defined as Hsp90 clients, although they diverge strongly in the extent of regulation by the chaperone (Fig. 1A). Summing up all available evidence from the literature and our own data for regulation of mammalian kinases by Hsp90 resulted in a list of 105 kinases (80 Hsp90 clients, 25 non-clients; see supplemental table), which was mapped on a tree based on sequence homology (Fig. 4) (adapted from Ref. 31Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6215) Google Scholar). Interestingly, most Hsp90 clients (Fig. 4, gray ovals) are found in the families of tyrosine kinases and the related tyrosine kinase-like, in which non-client kinases are rarely observed. In contrast, non-clients (Fig. 4, black boxes) are more abundant in several groups of serine/threonine-specific kinases (e.g. CMGC, AGC, and STE). It is also interesting to examine the relationship of surface charge within the region of the αC-β4 loop to Hsp90 dependence for kinases with known structures. In a majority of cases (16 of 22), client kinases display an overall neutral or positive charge within the vicinity of the αC-β4 loop. In contrast, the majority of non-clients whose structures were analyzed (5 of 6) displayed an overall negative charge within this same region (data not shown). We next addressed the potential of defining a consensus sequence for the Hsp90 recognition motif. A profile of Hsp90 client kinases was made from local ungapped block alignments of αC-β4 loop sequences (13 amino acids; MAGVGSPYVSRLLG in ErbB-2) of 73 Hsp90 client kinases, which aligned without gaps. In addition, a non-client profile was made from the αC-β4 loop sequences of 17 non-clients (see supplemental table for sequences). Sequence logos demonstrate the amino acid distribution at each position in these profiles (Fig. 5B). The profiles were compared with each other using the LAMA (local alignment of multiple alignments) profile comparison method (32Pietrokovski S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3836-3845Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), demonstrating a high similarity of the profiles (data not shown).

A similar ambiguity affects the interpretation of signals from fluorescent membrane-permeant cations (usually termed “mitochondrial membrane potential indicators”), because the accumulation of these probes is influenced by both plasma and mitochondrial membrane potentials.

Exploiting this technique, primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule neurons display a concentration-dependent response to ionomycin: low concentrations mimic nigericin by hyperpolarizing the mitochondria while slowly depolarizing the plasma membrane and maintaining a stable elevated cytoplasmic calcium. Higher ionomycin concentrations induce a stochastic failure of calcium homeostasis that precedes both mitochondrial depolarization and an enhanced rate of plasma membrane depolarization. In addition, the protonophore carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone only selectively depolarizes mitochondria at submicromolar concentrations.

Whereas synthetic and natural ionophores are powerful tools for manipulating cellular physiology, their inherent lack of specificity means that they influence the ion permeability of several membranes in the cell. The two classes of ionophores that are most commonly used are the electroneutral Ca2+/2H+ exchangers typified by ionomycin, and protonophores, such as carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP). 2The abbreviations used are: FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; [Ca2+]c, cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration; ΔΨp, plasma membrane potential; ΔΨm, mitochondrial membrane potential; PMPI, plasma membrane potential indicator; TMRM+, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester; CGN, cerebellar granule neuron; NBQX, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-nitro-2,3-dioxo-benzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; MK801, methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzocyclohepten-5,10-imine; TPB-, tetraphenylboron; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl) ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; DIV, days in vitro. 2The abbreviations used are: FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; [Ca2+]c, cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration; ΔΨp, plasma membrane potential; ΔΨm, mitochondrial membrane potential; PMPI, plasma membrane potential indicator; TMRM+, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester; CGN, cerebellar granule neuron; NBQX, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-nitro-2,3-dioxo-benzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; MK801, methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzocyclohepten-5,10-imine; TPB-, tetraphenylboron; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl) ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; DIV, days in vitro. Ionomycin is most commonly used with the assumption that it will generate a stable, moderately elevated, cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]c with maintained cell viability. However, ionomycin also intercalates into the inner mitochondrial membrane where it provides an additional pathway for Ca2+ efflux from the matrix in parallel with the native Ca2+/Na+ antiporter, setting up a proton-dissipating, i.e. uncoupling, Ca2+ cycle that is controlled by the activity of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter and hence by [Ca2+]c (1Åkerman K.E.O. Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 115: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The bioenergetic consequences of this are usually ignored, although they could have profound effects on cellular function. Conversely, protonophores such as FCCP that are widely employed to depolarize mitochondria in intact cells can affect plasma membrane potentials at higher concentrations (2Rottenberg H. Wu S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).An equally important ambiguity surrounds the widespread use of cationic, membrane permeant, fluorescent probes as mitochondrial membrane potential indicators (3Ehrenberg B. Montana V. Wei M.D. Wuskell J.P. Loew L.M. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 4Farkas D.L. Wei M.D. Febbroriello P. Carson J.H. Loew L.M. Biophys.

J. 1998; 75: 1648-1658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) because their uptake and equilibrium accumulation within the mitochondrial matrix of the cell is responsive equally to the plasma membrane potential, ΔΨp, and the mitochondrial membrane potential, ΔΨm. With the explosion of interest in the multiple roles played by in situ mitochondria in cell physiology and pathology (reviewed in Refs. 6Nicholls D.G. Curr. Mol. Med. 2004; 4: 149-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar and 7Duchen M.R. Mol. Aspects Med. 2004; 25: 365-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) has come the importance of accurately monitoring changes in ΔΨm in intact cells. The complicating role of the plasma membrane was recognized at an early stage (4Farkas D.L. Wei M.D. Febbroriello P. Carson J.H. Loew L.M. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 1053-1069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and is exacerbated in studies in which both ΔΨm and the plasma membrane potential (ΔΨp) change during the experiment. We have previously presented a semiquantitative technique for the interpretation of whole cell cationic indicator traces under such conditions (8Ward M.W. Rego A.C. Frenguelli B.G. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7208-7219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) based on curve fitting and estimates of likely changes in ΔΨp. The approach has proven useful for deciphering experiments in “quench mode” (when the probe concentration in the matrix is sufficient for reversible aggregation) as well as for interpreting traces obtained with probes with differing permeability rate constants (8Ward M.W. Rego A.C. Frenguelli B.G. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7208-7219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rego A.C. Ward M.W. Nicholls D.G. J.

Quench mode is only applicable to experiments in which rapid step changes in ΔΨm occur while the cell is being imaged (8Ward M.W. Rego A.C. Frenguelli B.G. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7208-7219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, low probe loadings that avoid matrix quenching must be employed to follow slow changes in potential as well as to estimate pre-existing values of ΔΨm in cell populations (reviewed in Ref. 12Nicholls D.G. Ward M.W. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 166-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Under these latter conditions there is serious ambiguity as to whether the observed change in fluorescence is due to a difference in ΔΨp, ΔΨm, or both.It is evidently important to monitor both potentials. Anionic membrane-permeant probes are excluded from polarized cells due to the negative plasma membrane potential but partition increasingly into the cell upon plasma membrane depolarization. Because of their negative charge these probes are not accumulated by mitochondria. Anionic oxonol dyes have been used for several years to monitor changes in ΔΨp (13Civitelli R. Reid I.R.

Phys. Lipids. 1994; 69: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), but their usefulness is compromised by a relatively slow equilibration across the plasma membrane. Recently a proprietary plasma membrane potential assay kit (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) has become available in which the problem of background fluorescence from the high extracellular probe concentration is suppressed by a hydrophilic quencher (17Baxter D.F. Kirk M. Garcia A.F. Raimondi A. Holmqvist M.H. Flint K.K. Bojanic D. Distefano P.S. Curtis R. Xie Y. J. Biomol. Screen. 2002; 7: 79-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In this paper a technique was developed for combining the use of the Molecular Devices fluorescent anion (which is termed PMPI, for “plasma membrane potential indicator”) with the established cationic indicator tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM+). At the same time we have devised a curve-fitting spreadsheet to interpret the traces. As well as providing a more quantitative means of compensating the TMRM+ signal for changes in ΔΨp, this combined technique allows for the first time simultaneous and continuous monitoring of ΔΨp and ΔΨm in cultured neurons. Whereas the technique is validated for cerebellar granule neurons exposed to a variety of ionophores and inhibitors on a confocal microscope, with suitable calibration the methodology is equally applicable to any attached cell preparation and can be used with non-confocal imaging. Finally the curve-fitting spreadsheet may also be used for single-probe studies of ΔΨm, where ΔΨp is invariant or its changes can be estimated.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—TMRM+ fluo-4 and fluo-5F were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). PMPI is a proprietary component of the Membrane Potential Assay Kit (R-8042) from Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA. All other reagents were from Sigma.Preparation of Cerebellar Granule Neurons—Cerebellar granule neurons were prepared from 7-day-old Wistar rats as previously described (18Courtney M.J. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 983-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, cells were plated into coverslip-based 8-well chambers (LabTek, Naperville, IL) previously coated with 33 μg/ml polyethyleneimine, at a density of 380,000 cells per 0.8-cm2 well. Cultures were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 30 mm glucose, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. 24 h after plating, 10 μm cytosine arabinoside was added to inhibit growth of non-neuronal cells. Cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C in an incubator with a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air and used for experiments at 12–14 days in culture.Plasma Membrane Potential Indicator—An individual vial from a Molecular Devices “membrane potential assay kit, explorer format” (R-8042) containing a proprietary plasma membrane potential indicator was reconstituted in 1 ml of distilled water, dispensed into 50-μl aliquots, and frozen (PMPI stock). For spectral analysis 20 μl of PMPI stock was diluted with 250 μl of water and extracted with 250 μl of octanoyl alcohol to separate the anionic indicator from the aqueous quencher present in the PMPI stock. Excitation and emission spectra (Fig. 1) were determined with a PerkinElmer LS50 scanning spectrophotometer for PMPI in octanoyl alcohol and compared with tetramethylrhodamine in water.Simultaneous Monitoring of PMPI and TMRM+ Fluorescence—Cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) were washed and incubated (37 °C, pH 7.4) for 45 min prior to imaging with a medium (low K-medium) containing 3.5 mm KCl, 120 mm NaCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm Na2SO4, 15 mm d-glucose, 20 mm Na-TES, 1 μm tetraphenylboron, 5 nm TMRM+, and 0.5 μl/ml PMPI stock. An identical medium in which 120 mm NaCl was substituted by 120 mm KCl was prepared (high-K medium). 5 nm TMRM+ is below the limit for probe aggregation and quenching within the matrix. In some experiments the TMRM+ concentration was varied. The PMPI concentration was chosen to obtain a signal comparable with that of TMRM+. The presence of tetraphenylboron (TPB-) facilitates the equilibration of TMRM+ and other lipophilic cations (4Farkas D.L. Wei M.D. Febbroriello P. Carson J.H. Loew L.M. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 1053-1069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 8Ward M.W. Rego A.C. Frenguelli B.G. Nicholls D.G. J.

No effect of 1 μm TPB- on the equilibrium distribution of either PMPI or TMRM+ was detected. No extracellular PMPI fluorescence could be detected and addition of 0.5% Triton X-100 abolished both the TMRM+ and PMPI signals associated with the cells.Cells were imaged on a Zeiss Pascal confocal Axiovert 100M microscope equipped with a computer-driven stage. The technique is equally applicable to non-confocal imaging, and unless otherwise stated, the pinhole diameter was increased to give an optical slice of 10 μm to allow collection of the defocused signal from individual somata. Fluorescence was excited in single track mode with the 514-nm band of an argon laser. Because the emission peaks of the two indicators are separated by only 20 nm (Fig. 1) the spectral overlap must be corrected. To accomplish this the emitted epifluorescence was split with a 570-nm dichroic mirror and detected in channel 1 through a Chroma 595–650-nm filter and channel 2 with a Chroma 525–575-nm filter. Crossover between the two channels was quantified with cell preparations loaded with a single probe. The values obtained were dependent upon the amplifier gains for the two channels and so these were kept constant throughout. Laser power was adjusted to obtain an optimal image and did not exceed 5% when used with the ×20 air objective. Whereas the Zeiss software allows for pixel by pixel correction of crossover between the two emission spectra using its subtractive function, it is equally valid to correct single-cell time courses in a spreadsheet. Scan averaging was performed for the high resolution studies shown in Fig. 2 using the ×63 oil immersion objective with line mode summing of four repetitive scans at 1% laser power to minimize phototoxicity.FIGURE 2Confocal images of CGNs equilibrated with PMPI and 5 nm TMRM+. CGNs were equilibrated with PMPI and 5 nm TMRM+ in low- (3.9 mm) K medium as described under “Materials and Methods.” Images were corrected for crossover between the fluorophores (Equations 1 and 2). After imaging cells in low-K medium, media was exchanged to increase [K+] to 25 mm and the field was imaged again when re-equilibration was complete. The lower panels show the intensity profiles through the cell, scale in micrometers. Note the reciprocal changes in probe intensity, the lack of co-localization between the PMPI and TMRM+ fluorescence, and the exclusion of PMPI from the nucleus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Curve-fitting Computer Simulation—The simulation to convert the TMRM+ and PMPI fluorescence traces into a time course of changes in ΔΨp and ΔΨm is described in supplementary data where it may be accessed as an Excel spreadsheet.

When applied to data (Figs. 3, 6, 7, 8, and 10) the experimental data points are represented by symbols (closed squares for PMPI, open squares for TMRM+) and the fitted computer simulation by the underlying solid lines.

CGNs were equilibrated with PMPI in 3.9 mm K medium as described under “Materials and Methods.” A, varying volumes of 120 mm K+ medium were substituted to give final K+ concentrations from 4 to 80 mm with a proportionate decrease in Na+. Plasma membrane potentials were calculated from the Goldman equation assuming conductances for K+, Na+, and Cl- of 1:100:1. (see text). The fluorescent enhancement relative to 4 mm K+ was determined for the mean of 10 cell bodies with no contaminating membrane fragments at each K+ concentration (closed squares, K+ concentration in parentheses). The trend line (solid) is given by a second-order regression curve (see Equation 1). The dotted line represents the fluorescence enhancement that would result from a purely “Nernstian” distribution. The open triangle reports the fluorescent quenching resulting from the hyperpolarization produced by the addition of 0.5 μm valinomycin (in the presence of 5 μg/ml oligomycin).

B, addition of 0.5 μm nigericin to the cells causes a partial depolarization of the plasma membrane followed by a mitochondrial hyperpolarization of 30 mV, consistent with a collapse of a pH gradient of at least 0.5 units across the inner membrane and the compensatory increase in ΔΨm.

The experimental data points for a single representative cell body are shown. In parallel, cells loaded with 0.5 μm fluo-5F-AM and 5 nm TMRM+ were exposed to 1μm ionomycin. A cell soma was selected that showed the same kinetics of TMRM+ loss as the first cell and the trace of fluo-5F fluorescence was adjusted on the x axis to synchronize the mitochondrial depolarizations. Note that Ca2+ deregulation precedes the loss of TMRM+. D, computer simulation of changes in ΔΨm and ΔΨp that produce the best fit (solid lines in C) with the experimental traces. Note the biphasic responses of both potentials to ionomycin addition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RESULTSFig. 2 depicts equatorial confocal slices through the somata of 12 DIV CGNs equilibrated with PMPI and 5 nm TMRM+. In the polarized cells, PMPI fluorescence is faint and associated with the plasma membrane with slight cytoplasmic fluorescence. Depolarization with 25 mm K+ results in a increase in cell-associated PMPI fluorescence following entry of the probe into the cytoplasm although the probe remains excluded from the nucleus. The decrease in TMRM+ fluorescence is due to the decreased probe accumulation across the plasma membrane in the partially depolarized cells (see Equation 5).Computer Simulation—The computer simulation can be accessed in supplementary data. The theoretical basis of the simulation is developed below.PMPI Calibration—It is first necessary to calibrate the enhancement in the PMPI fluorescence as a function of plasma membrane depolarization. This does not follow an ideal Nernstian relationship, but instead is determined empirically by quantifying the fluorescent enhancement obtained when ΔΨp is depolarized by increasing KCl concentrations. The relationship between ΔΨp and the K+ concentration of the medium (Fig. 3A) was calculated from electrophysiological data in Laritzen et al. (20Lauritzen I. Zanzouri M. Honoré E. Duprat F. Ehrengruber M.U. Lazdunski M. Patel A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32068-32076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) applying the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation. An initial value for the ΔΨp of 8–12 DIV rat CGNs in 3.9 mm KCl media of -83 mV at 37 °C was calculated. A series of experiments were then performed with PMPI-equilibrated CGNs in which step increases in K+ concentrations were made by removing defined volumes of low-K medium and replacing this with an equal volume of high-K medium to give final K+ concentrations from 4 to 80 mm. The mean fluorescent enhancement for 10 cell bodies was determined for each K+ concentration and plotted as a function of ΔΨp (Fig. 4A). The best fit with the empirical fluorescent enhancement was obtained with a second-order regression curve, E=1+0.03(ΔΨKCl−83)+0.0005(ΔΨKCl−83)2 (Eq. 1) where E is the fluorescent enhancement relative to cells in 3.9 mm KCl medium and ΔΨKCl the calculated plasma membrane potential at a given KCl concentration. It should be noted that the fluorescent enhancement is considerably less than that predicted for the change in free cytoplasmic PMPI concentration from the Nernst equation (dashed line in Fig. 3A), presumably due to complicating factors of probe binding to membranes and proteins and changes in fluorescence yield. Using this empirical relationship, an observed change in whole cell PMPI fluorescence can be calibrated as a function of ΔΨp.FIGURE 4Estimation of the volume fraction of the CGN cell soma occupied by the mitochondrial matrix and the quench limit for TMRM+ in the mitochondrial matrix. A, the curve shows the theoretical ratio for the whole cell fluorescence of neurons with depolarized versus polarized mitochondria (Tdepol/Tpol) as a function of the fractional volume occupied by the mitochondrial matrices (x), see Equation 6. Neurons were equilibrated with 5 nm TMRM+ in low-K medium and cell soma were imaged. Myxothiazol (5 μm) plus oligomycin (5 μg/ml) were then added and the final fluorescence determined. PMPI fluorescence confirmed that no change occurred in ΔΨp (see Fig. 7). The vertical lines show the mean (solid line) ± S.E. (dashed lines) for Tdepol/Tpol for 10 randomly chosen cells. The horizontal lines are the corresponding extrapolations to the y axis, indicating a mean matrix fractional volume of 0.023 ± 0.02. B, cells were equilibrated in low-K medium for 60 min with the indicated concentrations of TMRM+ in the absence of TPB-. At the arrow a combination of 2.5 μm rotenone, 2.5 μg/ml oligomycin, and 250 nm FCCP was added to collapse ΔΨm.

Here we report that non-receptor Src tyrosine kinase and the membrane protein caveolin-1 (Cav-1) play a key role in the activation of RAGE by S100B in VSMCs. S100B increased the activation of Src kinase and tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 in VSMCs. A RAGE-specific antibody blocked both these effects. An inhibitor of Src kinase, PP2, significantly blocked S100B-induced activation of Src kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinases, transcription factors NF-κB and STAT3, superoxide production, tyrosine phosphorylation of Cav-1, VSMC migration, and expression of the pro-inflammatory genes monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and interleukin-6. Cholesterol depletion also inhibited S100B-induced effects indicating the requirement for intact caveolae in RAGE-specific signaling. Nucleofection of either a Src dominant negative mutant, or a Cav-1 mutant lacking the scaffolding domain, or Cav-1 short hairpin RNA significantly reduced S100B-induced inflammatory gene expression in VSMCs. Furthermore, VSMCs derived from insulin-resistant and diabetic db/db mice displayed increased RAGE expression, Src activation, and migration compared with those from control db/+ mice.

RAGE is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell-surface molecules and is expressed in many cell types, including VSMCs. It can be activated by multiple ligands such as amphoterin, β-amyloid peptide, and several short peptides belonging to the S100/calgranulin family, which includes S100B (9Yan S.F. Ramasamy R. Naka Y.

However, the role of key upstream tyrosine kinases in signaling mechanisms triggered by the ligation of RAGE in VSMCs is not known.

Cav-1 is an integral protein of caveolae that are specialized cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains existing as vesicular invaginations in several cells, including VSMCs. Cav-1 plays an important role in the assembly and integration of signaling complexes within caveolae (32Shaul P.W. Anderson R.G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 19: L843-L851Google Scholar, 33Smart E.J.

Our results demonstrate for the first time that S100B activates Src kinase in a RAGE-dependent manner and that Src kinase is required for the S100B-induced RAGE signaling leading to migration and inflammatory gene expression in VSMCs. Furthermore, our results also show the involvement of Cav-1 in S100B-induced inflammatory gene expression in VSMCs and provide evidence for the involvement of RAGE signaling in enhanced atherogenic responses in VSMCs derived from diabetic mice.

Both RVSMCs and MVSMCs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and streptomycin/penicillin. Human aortic smooth muscle cell (HVSMCs) were purchased from Cambrex (East Rutherford, NJ) and cultured according to the manufacturer's specifications. In all the experiments, cells were grown to 80% confluence and serum-starved for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin before subjecting them to experimental conditions unless mentioned otherwise. VSMCs were stimulated with S100B at a concentration of 10 μg/ml, unless indicated otherwise. In some experiments cells were pretreated with inhibitors PP2, N-acetylcysteine, bisindolylmaleimide (GFX109203), β-cyclodextrin, or SB202190 at the indicated concentrations for 30 min to 1 h prior to stimulation with S100B. Determination of Superoxide Formation—S100B-induced superoxide production was detected using dihydroethidine staining as described earlier (37Reddy M.A. Kim Y.-S. Lanting L. Natarajan R. Hypertension. 2003; 41: 1294-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, VSMCs were seeded on coverslips placed in 12-well cluster dishes at 50,000 cells per well. Cells at 80% confluence were serum-starved for 48 h and then treated with S100B for 30 min and stained with dihydroethidine (20 mm) for 10 min at 37 °C. The coverslips were then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and sealed in mounting medium. Fluorescence was detected using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (wavelength: 510 nm/595 nm). Fluorescence intensity was quantified using Image Pro software (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Silver Spring, MD). Preparation of Cell Lysates, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—After stimulation with S100B, total cell lysates were prepared in SDS sample buffer for Western blotting. To perform immunoprecipitations, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies as described previously (38Reddy M.A. Thimmalapura P.R. Lanting L. Nadler J.L. Fatima S. Natarajan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9920-9928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), except that, when Cav-1 was immunoprecipitated, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing β-octylglucoside instead of deoxycholate. Protein samples were fractionated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels to detect Cav-1 or on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for all other proteins. Fractionated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies, and blots were developed using chemiluminescence reagents as described earlier (38Reddy M.A. Thimmalapura P.R. Lanting L. Nadler J.L. Fatima S. Natarajan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9920-9928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent Staining of VSMCs—Immunofluorescent staining of VSMCs grown on coverslips was performed as described before (39Sahar S. Dwarakanath R.S. Reddy M.A. Lanting L. Todorov I. Natarajan R. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 1064-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, serum-depleted VSMCs were treated with S100B as indicated. In some experiments cells were pretreated with the indicated inhibitors for 1 h prior to stimulation with S100B. At the end of the incubation period the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 3% formaldehyde for 20 min. The cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and immunostained with the indicated antibodies followed by appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to rhodamine or fluorescein isothiocyanate. Coverslips were mounted on slides and viewed under a confocal microscope LSM510 (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). Cell Migration Assay—VSMC migration assays were performed in a modified 48-well Boyden's microchemotaxis chamber as described earlier (40Natarajan R. Bai W. Rangarajan V. Gonzales N. Gu J.L. Lanting L. Nadler J.L. J. Cell Physiol. 1996; 169: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In some experiments cells were pretreated with indicated inhibitors, RAGE antibody, or control IgG for 1 h. Preparation of Human Cav-1-specific shRNA Expression Vectors—The plasmid vectors expressing Cav-1 shRNA were constructed using methods described earlier (41Dwarakanath R.S. Sahar S. Reddy M.A. Castanotto D. Rossi J.J. Natarajan R. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2004; 36: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 42Li S.L. Dwarakanath R.S. Cai Q. Lanting L. Natarajan R. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 220-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, shRNAs under the control of U6 promoter were cloned into a vector, which also expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein from a CMV promoter to monitor transfection efficiency. The shRNA vectors targeting several regions of human Cav-1 were co-transfected with a Cav-1 expression vector into HEK293 cells and inhibition of Cav-1 protein levels monitored by Western blotting of the cell lysates. The two most efficient shRNA vectors were selected to transfect HVSMCs as described below. Sequences used for the shRNAs in the experiments were: Cav1-100, 5′-gacgagctgagcgagaagcaa-3′; and Cav1-383, 5′-gggcagttgtaccatgcatta-3′ corresponding to 100-120 and 383-403 bp of human Cav-1. RNA Preparation and Relative RT-PCR—Total RNA from VSMCs was isolated using RNA-STAT60 reagent, and the mRNA levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) determined by previously described methods (43Reddy M.A. Adler S.G. Kim Y.-S. Lanting L. Rossi J. Kang S.-W. Nadler J.L. Shahed A. Natarajan R. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F985-F994Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, relative RT-PCRs were performed with 0.5 μg of RNA using gene-specific primers and Quantum RNA 18 S internal standards. The PCR primer sequences have been described earlier (41Dwarakanath R.S. Sahar S. Reddy M.A. Castanotto D. Rossi J.J. Natarajan R. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2004; 36: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 42Li S.L. Dwarakanath R.S. Cai Q. Lanting L. Natarajan R. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 220-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). PCR products were fractionated on 2.0% agarose gels and photographed using an AlphaImager 2000 Documentation and Analysis system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). The densities of amplified products corresponding to specific genes and 18 S RNA were determined with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Results are expressed as -fold stimulation over control after normalizing with the levels of internal standard (18 S RNA). Nucleofection of VSMCs with SrcRF, Cav-1 Mutants, Cav-1 shRNAs, and Control Scrambled shRNA—HVSMCs were trypsinized and resuspended at 1 × 107 cells/ml, and 1 × 106 cells were nucleofected with the indicated plasmids (3 μg each) using a nucleofection equipment as described by the manufacturer (Amaxa, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The cells were allowed to recover overnight and serum-depleted for 48 h prior to stimulation with S100B. Transfection efficiency was monitored by examining enhanced green fluorescent protein expression, and we were able to get ∼50% transfection efficiency. Activation of Src Kinase by S100B—Tyrosine kinase activity plays an important role in VSMC function, including migration. Receptors lacking tyrosine kinase activity utilize Src, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase. Because RAGE does not have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, we hypothesized that Src kinases might play an important role in RAGE signaling. To test this we first examined whether the RAGE-specific ligand S100B can activate Src kinase in VSMCs. Serum-depleted PVSMCs were stimulated with S100B for 0-60 min, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a Src monoclonal antibody. Src immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with a polyclonal phospho-Src antibody that recognizes Src phosphorylated at its autophosphorylation site (Tyr-416). Results showed that S100B treatment rapidly induced Src activation (5 min), and this was sustained up to 60 min (Fig. 1A, upper panel). When the blot was stripped and probed with an antibody that recognizes both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated Src (total Src) it showed that the immunoprecipitates contained equal amounts of Src protein in all the samples (Fig. 1A, lower panel). Quantitation of Src activation at 5 min from multiple experiments is shown in Fig. 1B. These results demonstrate for the first time that RAGE ligands can activate Src kinase in VSMCs. Stimulation of Cav-1 Tyrosine Phosphorylation by S100B—We next examined the downstream effectors of Src kinase in S100B-stimulated VSMCs. Evidence shows that, in cells exposed to oxidant stress, Src phosphorylates Cav-1, the structural component of caveolae, on Tyr-14 (44Volonte D. Galbiati F. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8094-9103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Because RAGE also induces oxidant stress, we tested whether the activation of Src kinase by S100B may lead to Tyr-14 phosphorylation of Cav-1. First, we examined whether RAGE co-localizes with Cav-1 in VSMCs by performing double immunostaining with a polyclonal RAGE antibody and a monoclonal Cav-1 antibody. The slides were observed under a confocal microscope by taking several z-sections. As shown in Fig. 2A, both RAGE antibody as well as Cav-1 antibody staining could be seen on the cell surface, and a merge of the two images clearly showed that RAGE is co-localized with Cav-1 in VSMCs. Having established the co-localization of RAGE and Cav-1, we next examined if Cav-1 is phosphorylated in S100B-stimulated VSMCs. Cell lysates prepared from PVSMCs stimulated with S100B for 5-60 min were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal Cav-1 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblotting with a monoclonal phospho-Cav-1 antibody that recognizes only Cav-1 protein phosphorylated at Tyr-14. Results showed that S100B treatment stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Cav-1 (Fig. 2B). The phosphorylation was apparent by 10 min, and this returned to basal levels by 60 min. Stripping and immunoblotting of this blot with Cav-1 antibody showed that total Cav-1 levels did not change under these conditions. Cell lysates from this experiment were also immunoprecipitated with Src antibody, and these Src immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with a phospho-Src antibody. Results showed that the activation of Src parallels that of Cav-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2C shows the quantitation of Cav-1 tyrosine phosphorylation from multiple experiments. These results demonstrate for the first time that RAGE ligands can stimulate Cav-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in VSMCs. RAGE Mediates S100B-induced Src Activation and Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Cav-1—Next we examined whether the S100B-induced activation of Src kinase and tyrosine phosphorylation of Cav-1 are dependent on RAGE signaling. Serum-depleted VSMCs were preincubated with either a polyclonal RAGE-specific antibody (70 μg/ml) or control normal rabbit IgG for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates of Src or Cav-1 antibodies from these cell lysates were immunoblotted with phospho-Src and phospho-Cav-1 antibodies, respectively. Results showed that the RAGE antibody could block S100B-stimulated Src activation (Fig. 3A, upper panel) as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of Cav-1 (Fig. 3B, upper panel). The lower panels in both figures show that the immunoprecipitates contain equal amounts of Src or Cav-1. Fig. 3 (C and D) shows bar graph quantitation of the results expressed as -fold over control. Thus, these results clearly demonstrate that S100B acts via the RAGE receptor to induce Src activation and Cav-1 phosphorylation in VSMCs. Involvement of Src Kinases in S100B-induced Oxidant Stress in VSMCs—Because activation of RAGE induces oxidant stress, we next examined whether Src kinases are involved in S100B-induced oxidant stress. PVSMCs grown on coverslips were serum-depleted and left untreated or pretreated with a Src kinase inhibitor PP2 (10 μm) for 60 min. The cells were then stimulated with S100B for 30 min and stained with a cell-permeable fluorescent dye dihydroethidine to detect superoxide formation using a fluorescent microscope. The intensity of fluorescence in each field was quantitated using Image Pro software. As shown in Fig. 4, S100B was able to induce superoxide formation by 2-fold in 30 min (panel B) compared with control cells (panel A), and the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 blocked S100B-induced superoxide production (panels F versus B). The vehicle (Me2SO) for PP2 did not have any effect (panels C and D). These results demonstrate the involvement of Src kinases in S100B-induced oxidant stress in VSMCs. Requirement of Caveolae, Src Kinase, and Oxidant Stress in S100B-induced Cav-1 Tyrosine Phosphorylation—Next we examined whether the integrity of caveolae, Src activation, and oxidant stress were required for Cav-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. VSMCs were pretreated for 1 h with the Src inhibitor PP2 (10 μm), or anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 10 mm), or β-cyclodextrin (10 mm), which is known to deplete cholesterol and disrupt the integrity of caveolae. The cells were subsequently stimulated with S100B for 10 min, and the Cav-1 immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with the phospho-Cav-1 antibody (Fig. 5A). The intensities of phospho-Cav-1 bands were quantified, and the results expressed as -fold stimulation over control “no inhibitor” (NI) cells (Fig. 5E). Results in Fig. 5 (A and E) show that S100B-induced Cav-1 Tyr phosphorylation was significantly inhibited by both anti-oxidant (NAC) as well as Src inhibitor (PP2) compared with NI control, whereas Me2SO (DM in Fig. 5), the vehicle for PP2, had no effect. Pre-treatment with βCD increased the basal tyrosine phosphorylation of Cav-1, but S100B had no further effect. Fig. 5B shows that total Cav-1 levels were not altered by these treatments. Src activation was also examined in these cell lysates after immunoprecipitation with Src antibody. As shown in Fig. 5C, the anti-oxidant and PP2 blocked Src activation, whereas cholesterol depletion and Me2SO (DM) had no effect. Fig. 5D shows that total Src levels were similar in all the samples. Fig. 5F shows the bar graph quantitation of Src activation expressed as -fold stimulation. These results show that S100B-induced Cav-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was dependent on Src activation and that oxidant stress is involved in both Src activation as well as Cav-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Results with βCD indicate that disruption of caveolae leads to no"

https://openalex.org/W1969662182,"The F1F0-ATP synthase in mitochondria, in addition to its function in energy transduction, has a structural role in determining cristae morphology. This depends on its ability to form dimeric and higher oligomeric supracomplexes. Here we show that mutants of the dimer-specific subunits e and g, which destabilize dimeric and oligomeric F1F0-ATP synthase supracomplexes, have a decreased mitochondrial membrane potential delta psi. The degree of destabilization correlated with the reduction of the membrane potential. The enzymatic activities of F1F0-ATP synthase and cytochrome c oxidase, maximal respiration rate, coupling of oxidative phosphorylation, and tubular mitochondrial morphology were not affected or only to a minor extent. In mutants lacking one or two coiled-coil domains of subunit e, the reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential was not due to loss of mitochondrial DNA, a reduced capacity of oxidative phosphorylation, or to altered cristae morphology. We propose a role for the supracomplexes of the F1F0-ATP synthase in organizing microdomains within the inner membrane, ensuring optimal bioenergetic competence of mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2156216502,"Excessive water uptake through Aquaporins (AQP) can be life-threatening and reversible AQP inhibitors are needed. Here, we determined the specificity, potency, and binding site of tetraethylammonium (TEA) to block Aquaporin water permeability. Using oocytes, externally applied TEA blocked AQP1/AQP2/AQP4 with IC50 values of 1.4, 6.2, and 9.8 μm, respectively. Related tetraammonium compounds yielded some (propyl) or no (methyl, butyl, or pentyl) inhibition. TEA inhibition was lost upon a Tyr to Phe amino acid switch in the external water pore of AQP1/AQP2/AQP4, whereas the water permeability of AQP3 and AQP5, which lack a corresponding Tyr, was not blocked by TEA. Consistent with experimental data, multi-nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations showed one stable binding site for TEA, but not tetramethyl (TMA), in AQP1, resulting in a nearly 50% water permeability inhibition, which was reduced in AQP1-Y186F due to effects on the TEA inhibitory binding region. Moreover, in the simulation TEA interacted with charged residues in the C (Asp128) and E (Asp185) loop, and the A(Tyr37-Asn42-Thr44) loop of the neighboring monomer, but not directly with Tyr186. The loss of TEA inhibition in oocytes expressing properly folded AQP1-N42A or -T44A is in line with the computationally predicted binding mode. Our data reveal that the molecular interaction of TEA with AQP1 differs and is about 1000-fold more effective on AQPs than on potassium channels. Moreover, the observed experimental and simulated similarities open the way for rational design and virtual screening for AQP-specific inhibitors, with quaternary ammonium compounds in general, and TEA in particular as a lead compound.

Aquaporins form a large family of integral membrane proteins that facilitate specific, efficient, and passive permeation of water, whereas members of the aqua(glycero)porins also permeate small solutes, such as glycerol and urea (1Nielsen S. Frokiaer J. Marples D. Kwon T.H. Agre P. Knepper M.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 205-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). In mammals, 13 different aqua(glycero)porins have been identified, which differ in their tissues of expression, regulation, and selectivity. The gross structure of these membrane proteins is conserved and consists of six transmembrane domains with cytoplasmic N and C termini. The 1st intracellular (B) and 2nd extracellular (E) loop, both containing the highly conserved Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA) motive, fold back into the membrane and form the central part of the water pore (2Murata K.

Aquaporins are involved in the regulation of the water balance in many tissues (1Nielsen S. Frokiaer J. Marples D. Kwon T.H. Agre P. Knepper M.A. Physiol.

In the kidney, AQP1 is present in the proximal tubules and thin descending limbs of Henle, in which almost 90% of the 180 liters of daily formed pro-urine is reabsorbed. The remaining volume is concentrated via the vasopressin-regulated AQP2, which is present in the apical membrane of principal cells of the renal collecting duct (10Deen P.M.T. Verdijk M.A.J.

Nature. 1993; 361: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar), whereas AQP3 and AQP4, which are present in the basolateral membrane of these cells, form the exit pathway of water to the interstitium (1Nielsen S. Frokiaer J. Marples D. Kwon T.H. Agre P. Knepper M.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 205-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, 12Deen P.M.T. Van Balkom B.W.M. Kamsteeg E.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Besides the kidney, AQP3 is also found in the gastrointestinal tract and the stratum corneum of the skin, where it exhibits a high water permeability (13Sougrat R. Morand M. Gondran C. Barre P. Gobin R. Bonte F. Dumas M. Verbavatz J.M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 678-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The clinical importance of AQPs is shown by their role in several disturbed water balance disorders, which can severely affect the quality of life and can be life threatening. The lack of AQP2 in states of excessive water loss is fundamental to widely occurring nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, a disease in which the kidney is unable to concentrate urine in response to vasopressin (1Nielsen S. Frokiaer J. Marples D. Kwon T.H. Agre P. Knepper M.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 205-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, 14Knoers N.V.A.M. Deen P.M.T. Pediatr. Nephrol. 2001; 16: 1146-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In mice, lack of AQP3 also results in an nephrogenic diabetes insipidus phenotype, indicating that AQP3 might also have an important role in urine concentration (15Ma T. Song Y. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4386-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). AQP5 is present in the lung and exocrine glands, such as salivary and sweat glands (16Song Y. Sonawane N. Verkman A.S. J. Physiol. 2002; 541: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and the reduced saliva production in AQP5 knock-out mice underscores the important role of AQP5 in this process (17Ma T. Song Y. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20071-20074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, disorders characterized by excessive water transport have also shown or have been ascribed to AQPs. AQP1 has been shown to be involved in tumor growth (18Saadoun S. Papadopoulos M.C. Hara-chikuma M. Verkman A.S. Nature. 2005; 434: 786-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), and suggested to have a role in the development of pulmonary edema, eye glaucoma, and cyst formation in polycystic kidney disease (19King L.S. Agre P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 619-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In several disorders, excessive renal water uptake is due to high renal plasma membrane AQP2 expression, which can lead to life threatening hyponatremia (20Pedersen R.S. Bentzen H. Bech J.N. Nyvad O. Pedersen E.B. Kidney Int. 2003; 63: 1417-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). AQP4 is, among other tissues, expressed in cells lining brain ventricles and has been shown to have a key role in the formation of brain edema (21Manley G.T. Fujimura M. Ma T. Noshita N. Filiz F. Bollen A.W. Chan P. Verkman A.S. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar), as a consequence of hyponatremia, stroke, accidents, and cancer. Considering the important roles of AQPs in excessive water transport, reversible aquaporin-specific blockers are clinically highly desirable. Such blockers for AQP1, AQP2, and AQP3 could serve well as diuretics and anti-tumor drugs (AQP1), whereas a timely administration of AQP4-specific blockers might reduce the formation of brain edema. Such blockers, however, are yet not available. Mercury, silver, and gold have been shown to inhibit AQPs (22Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Niemietz C.M. Tyerman S.D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), but these metals are highly toxic and their inhibition is not reversible. Recently, however, it was reported that the ion channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA) weakly inhibits AQP1-mediated water permeability in oocytes (24Brooks H.L. Regan J.W. Yool A.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1021-1026PubMed Google Scholar) and mammalian cells (25Yool A.J. Brokl O.H. Pannabecker T.L. Dantzler W.H. Stamer W.D. BMC Physiol. 2002; 2: 4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because TEA can be chemically modified, it is potentially a promising lead compound for the development of AQP-specific and selective blockers. Therefore, we here tested its selectivity toward different water channels, determined its potency of inhibition on different AQPs, and determined the TEA-active site in AQP1, using a combination of an oocyte swelling assay, molecular docking, and MD simulations. Constructs—Expression constructs encoding human (h) AQP1 (pXβg-ev1hAQP1; kind gift of Peter Agre (3Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), pT7TshAQP2 (10Deen P.M.T. Verdijk M.A.J. Knoers N.V.A.M. Wieringa B. Monnens L.A.H. van Os C.H. van Oost B.A. Science. 1994; 264: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar), or pBSKSIIhAQP4 (26Lu M. Lee M.D. Smith B.L. Jung J.S. Agre P. Verdijk M.A.J. Merkx G. Rijss J.P.L. Deen P.M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10908-10912Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) were previously described. To generate pT7Ts-hAQP3, a 1444-bp BamHI-EcoRV fragment from pBSKSII hAQP3 (kind gift of Kenneth Ishibashi (27Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Fushimi K. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Saito H. Furukawa T. Nakajima K. Yamaguchi Y. Gojobori T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6269-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar)) was cloned into the BglII/EcoRV sites of the oocyte expression vector pT7Ts (10Deen P.M.T. Verdijk M.A.J. Knoers N.V.A.M. Wieringa B. Monnens L.A.H. van Os C.H. van Oost B.A. Science. 1994; 264: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). To obtain pT7Ts-hAQP5, an 887-bp BamHI/EcoRV fragment was cut from pBSKSII hAQP5 (kindly provided by Peter Agre (28Lee M.D. Bhakta K.Y. Raina S. Yonescu R. Griffin C.A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Preston G.M. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8599-8604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar)) and cloned into the BglII/EcoRV sites of pT7Ts. With the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany), mutations were introduced into the human AQP1-5 cDNA sequences, using the following forward primers: CTGGGCTTTAAATTCCCGGTG for Y37F, GGGAACGCCCAGACGGCGGTGCAGGAC for N42A, CAACCAGGCGGCGGTGCAGGAC for T44A, CGCAATTCCCTGGCTGATGGTGTCAAC for D128S, GCTATTTCCTACACCGGTTGTGGG for D185S, and GCTATTGACTTCACCGGTTGTGGGATTAACC for Y186F in AQP1; CCACCTCCTCGGGATCCATTTCACCGGCTGC for Y178F in AQP2; CATTGGCACCTCAATGGGCTTCTACTCCGGCTATGC for N209Y in AQP3; GCAATCAATTTTACCGGTGCCAGC for Y185F in AQP4; GGAATCTACTACACCGGTTGCTCCATGAAC for F179Y in AQP5; and GTCGGAATCTTCTACACCGGTTGCTCCATGAAC for Y178F/F179Y in AQP5. With these primers, restriction sites were introduced (DraI (Y37F), BsgI (N42A/T44A), HincII (D128S), and AgeI in AQP4-Y185F, AQP5-F179Y, and AQP5-Y178F/F179Y) or deleted (BstXI for AQP2-Y178F, NcoI site for AQP3-N209Y). Sequence analysis of selected clones confirmed that only the desired mutations were introduced. Water Permeability Measurements—Expression constructs were linearized with SalI (pT7TshAQP2, pT7TshAQP5), XbaI (pT7TshAQP3, pBSKSIIhAQP4), or PstI (pXβg-ev1hAQP1). G-capped cRNA transcripts were synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase (AQP2, -3, and -5) or T3 RNA polymerase (AQP1 and -4). Transcription, and the isolation, integrity checks, and determination of the concentration of the cRNAs was done as described (29Deen P.M.T. Croes H. van Aubel R.A. Ginsel L.A. van Os C.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 2291-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Xenopus oocytes were isolated and stored as described (30Mulders S.M. Bichet D.G. Rijss J.P.L. Kamsteeg E.J. Arthus M.F. Lonergan M. Fujiwara M. Morgan K. Leijendekker R. van der Sluijs P. van Os C.H. Deen P. M.T. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The oocytes were injected with 0.2-0.5 ng of cRNA coding for AQP1-5 and 0.5-1.0 ng of cRNA for the described mutants. One day after injection the follicular membranes were removed, and 2 days after injection the water permeability (Pf ± S.E.; N ≧ 8; in μm/s) was measured using a standard swelling assay (10Deen P.M.T. Verdijk M.A.J. Knoers N.V.A.M. Wieringa B. Monnens L.A.H. van Os C.H. van Oost B.A. Science. 1994; 264: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar), except that here ND96P saline buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 200 mosm ND96P) instead of modified Barth's solution was used, because the tested inhibitors were better soluble in ND96P. For the swelling assays, ND96P was diluted 10 times with Milli-Q water. To test TEA-like compounds for their inhibitory activity, injected oocytes were pretreated with the compound in ND96P for 15 min after which they were subjected to a swelling assay in 20 mosm ND96P in the presence of the compound. Similar results were obtained without the preincubation step. The data shown are an average of five experiments (with 5 different batches of oocytes) in which 10 to 12 oocytes were tested at every condition. The Pf values under different conditions were compared within one batch of oocytes. The measured Pf values were statistically analyzed in an unpaired Student's t test. p values < 0.05 were considered significantly different. For the calculation of the IC50 values of potential blockers, the ratio of inhibition (I/I0) was determined, in which “I” is the Pf at a certain inhibitor concentration and I0 is the Pf in the absence of inhibitor. Both values are corrected for the Pf of non-injected oocytes. The I/I0 values of each individual experiment were plotted against corresponding TEA concentrations and subjected to the automatic curve-fitting procedure in Microsoft Excel. The IC50 ± S.E. values were calculated from four independent experiments. Membrane Isolation and Immunoblotting—Total membranes and plasma membranes were isolated from at least 8 oocytes per sample as described (31Kamsteeg E.J. Deen P.M.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Protein samples were denatured by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in Laemmli buffer and blotted as described (29Deen P.M.T. Croes H. van Aubel R.A. Ginsel L.A. van Os C.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 2291-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Next, the blots were incubated overnight with 1:600 diluted mouse α-AQP1 (32Deen P.M.T. Nielsen S. Bindels R.J.M. van Os C.H. Pflugers Arch. 1997; 433: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), 1:1500 diluted rabbit α-AQP2 (29Deen P.M.T. Croes H. van Aubel R.A. Ginsel L.A. van Os C.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 2291-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), or 1:500 diluted α-AQP4 (33Van Balkom B.W.M. Van Raak M. Breton S. Pastor-Soler N. Bouley R. van der Sluijs P. Brown D. Deen P. M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1101-1107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween, pH 7.6) supplemented with 1% nonfat dried milk. As secondary antibodies, a 1:5000 dilution of goat α-rabbit IgG (Sigma) for AQP2 and AQP4, or a 1:2000 dilution of sheep α-mouse IgG (Sigma) for AQP1, both coupled to horseradish peroxidase, were used. Finally, AQP proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Determination of TEA Docking Sites—The molecular docking package DOCK 4.0 (34Ewing T.J. Kuntz I.D. J. Comp. Chem. 1997; 18: 1175-1189Crossref Scopus (548) Google Scholar) was used to dock TEA into the x-ray structure of bovine AQP1 (Protein Data Bank code 1J4N). Atomic coordinates including hydrogen atoms and charge information for TEA were generated using the SYBYL package from Tripos Inc. (SYBYL 6.9, Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MI). A three-dimensional model of TEA was build using the CONCORD (57Pearlman R.S. CONCORD User's Manual. Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO1998Google Scholar) package. Using the SPHGEN program (35Kuntz I.D. Blaney J.M. Oatley S.J. Langridge R. Ferrin T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 161: 269-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar), clusters of overlapping spheres were created in the upper vestibule of bovine AQP1. The original SPHGEN output file was edited using the InsightII package (58Inc Accelrys InsightII Modeling Environment, Release 2000. Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA2000Google Scholar) until a cluster of 16 spheres remained that filled the solvent accessible surface area of AQP1. Hydrogens were added to the protein and charged using a Gasteiger-Hückel potential. The Dock package flexibly orientated the TEA molecule within the defined docking region, scoring and ranking the 100 best orientations. Orientations were ranked using the energy score of DOCK. The molecular visualization package WITNOTP (59Widmer A. WITNOTP: A Computer Program for Molecular Modeling. Novartis, Basel, Switzerland1997Google Scholar) was used to inspect TEA in the upper vestibule of AQP1. Four representative orientations of TEA were selected as starting positions for subsequent MD studies. Molecular Dynamics Simulations—MD simulations were started from the bovine AQP1 x-ray structure (PDB code 1J4N (36Sui H. Han B.G. Lee J.K. Walian P. Jap B.K. Nature. 2001; 414: 872-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar)), after modifying the structure to adopt the sequence of human AQP1. The 21 mutations and the insertion of 2 residues were carried out using the WHAT IF package (37Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3363) Google Scholar). The percentage of sequence identity is 90.63%. None of the mutations or insertions is located in the pore region. AQP1 was simulated as a tetramer embedded in a solvated palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine lipid bilayer. The simulation system contained 8,340 protein atoms, 14,093 lipid atoms, 19,769 SPC water molecules (38Berendsen H.J. Postma J.P. van Gunsteren W.F. Hermans J. Pullman B. Intermolecular Forces. D. Reidel Publishing Company, Dordrecht2004Google Scholar), and four chloride ions, resulting in a system size of 81,739 atoms. The simulation setup and conditions were identical to those described before (7de Groot B.L. Grubmuller H. Science. 2001; 294: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). In short, MD simulations were carried out using the Gromacs simulation suite (39Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D. J. Mol. Model. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar). Lincs and Settle (40Hess B. Bekker H. Berendsen H.J. Fraaije J.G. J. Comp. Chem. 1997; 18: 1463-1472Crossref Scopus (11574) Google Scholar, 41Miyamoto S. Kollman P.A. J. Comp. Chem. 1992; 13: 952-962Crossref Scopus (5201) Google Scholar) were applied to constrain covalent bond lengths, allowing an integration time step of 2 fs. Electrostatic interactions were calculated using the Particle-Mesh Ewald method (40Hess B. Bekker H. Berendsen H.J. Fraaije J.G. J. Comp. Chem. 1997; 18: 1463-1472Crossref Scopus (11574) Google Scholar). The temperature was kept constant by separately coupling (τ = 0.1 ps) the protein, lipids, and solvent to an external temperature bath (42Berendsen H.J. Postma J.P. DiNola A. Haak J.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (23458) Google Scholar). The pressure was kept constant by weak coupling (τ = 1.0 ps) in the z-direction (normal to the bilayer plane) to a pressure bath (42Berendsen H.J. Postma J.P. DiNola A. Haak J.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (23458) Google Scholar). The gromacs force field was applied, which is the gromos 87 force field (43van Gunsteren W.F. Berendsen H.J. GROMOS Manual, BIOMOS. Biomolecular Software, Laboratory of Physical Chemistry, University of Groningen, The Netherlands1987Google Scholar) with slight modifications (44Van Buuren A.R. Marrink S.-J. Berendsen H. J.C. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 9206-9212Crossref Scopus (380) Google Scholar) and explicit hydrogens on aromatic residues. To equilibrate the system, 500 ps of MD were performed with harmonic position restraints on all non-hydrogen protein atoms (k = 1000 kJ/(mol nm)). All subsequent simulations started from the resulting structure. In total, seven simulations were performed, five of the wild type protein (WT), and two of the Y186F mutant. The simulation length of the seven production runs was 15 ns for each of the simulations, totaling 105 ns of simulation time. For the simulations including TEA and tetramethyl (TMA), initial positions for the inhibitors were derived from the docking approach described above. For WT_TEA1, TEA was placed at four different docking positions within the four monomeric channels of the tetramer, respectively (for the selection procedure of the docking orientations, see above). After inserting the TEA molecules, those water molecules that showed significant overlap with the inhibitor were removed from the simulation system. Because in this simulation TEA remained stably bound to the protein only in one of the four positions (see also “Results”), a second simulation (WT_TEA2) was started with TEA molecules bound to this position in all four monomers. In both simulations, to re-equilibrate the system, the position of the central nitrogen atom of the TEA was kept fixed by a harmonic positional restraint (k = 10000 kJ/(mol nm)) for 500 ps. The third simulation including TEA (WT_TEA3) started from the same conformation as WT_TEA2, but the equilibration period was extended to 3 ns before the production phase started. The WT_TMA simulation started, like the WT_TEA1 simulation, with TMA bound to four different positions obtained from the docking study described above. To all simulation systems including TEA and TMA, four additional chloride ions were added to compensate for the net charge of the quaternary ammonium ions. The starting structures for the simulations of the Y186F mutant, Y186F_free and Y186F_TEA, were modeled from the structures, after equilibration, of the WT_free and WT_TEA3 simulation, respectively, by replacing the tyrosine hydroxide groups by a proton. Free energy changes associated with the Y186F mutation were estimated with thermodynamic integration calculations. The difference in stability between the WT and mutant protein was estimated from the free energy difference between the mutation in the folded protein and in a model of the unfolded state (modeled as a tripeptide in solution). All thermodynamic integration simulations were carried out using the method of slow growth (45Bash P.A. Singh U.C. Langridge R. Kollman P.A. Science. 1987; 236: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), i.e. by gradually introducing the mutation into the simulated system (using soft-core parameters α = 0 (resulting in linear interpolation of the non-bonded interactions) and σ = 0.3 nm) during a simulation period of 1 ns. For both the folded state and unfolded state (tripeptide), forward and backward mutations were simulated to ensure that the mutation was sufficiently reversible and hysteresis effects were small. For molecular visualization the pymol program (46DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar) was used. Quaternary Ammonium Compounds Tested on Human AQP1—Brooks et al. (24Brooks H.L. Regan J.W. Yool A.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1021-1026PubMed Google Scholar) recently reported that 100 μm TEA could reversibly inhibit water permeation through AQP1. To test whether we could reproduce these data, Xenopus oocytes were injected with 0.2 ng of AQP1 cRNA and tested in an oocyte-swelling assay in the presence or absence of 100 μm TEA. Oocytes treated with TEA showed a reduced Pf of 44 ± 14% compared with controls (Fig. 1A). After subjection to a swelling assay in the presence of TEA, oocytes were washed four times and allowed to recover to the normal volume for 4 h. Subsequent analysis of these oocytes in a swelling assay in the absence of TEA (Fig. 1A, wash) revealed a Pf that was significantly higher than when they were treated with TEA (p = 0.038), and which was not significantly different from AQP1-expressing control oocytes (p = 0.074). These data confirm that the water permeation through AQP1 can be reversibly inhibited by TEA. To determine whether the lengths of the carbon side chain of quaternary ammonium compounds affected the inhibition of AQP1 water permeability, 100 μm concentrations of TMA-, tetrapropyl-(TPrA), tetrabutyl-(TBA), and tetrapentyl (TPeA) ammonium compounds were tested on AQP1-expressing oocytes. Determination of the Pfs revealed that, besides TEA, only TPrA significantly inhibited the AQP1 water permeability (32 ± 15%; p = 0.027; Fig. 1B). The inhibition by TPrA was not significantly different from that of TEA and was thus as effective as TEA at the tested concentration of 100 μm. In principle, the effect of TEA and TPrA on AQP1 water permeation could be either a direct effect of the compound on AQP1 functioning or a result of a reduced plasma membrane expression of AQP1 in the presence of the blockers. To address this question, AQP1-expressing oocytes were incubated with 100 μm TMA, TEA, or TPrA for 15 min, after which plasma membranes were isolated from eight oocytes in duplicate and immunoblotted for AQP1 (Fig. 1C). Analysis of the immunoblot signals revealed similar plasma membrane expression of AQP1 for oocytes treated with TEA/TPrA versus TMA (p = 0.11/0.20 respectively; n = 4). As differences in AQP1 amounts revealed different signal intensities at this exposure time (dilution series), this indicated that the reduced water permeability with TEA or TPrA was due to a direct inhibition of AQP1 instead of effects on the levels of AQP1 plasma membrane expression. Screening of AQP2-5 for Inhibitory Effects of Quaternary Ammonium Compounds—To determine whether the quaternary ammonium compounds specifically inhibit AQP1 or also affect the water permeation of other AQPs, oocytes expressing human AQP2, AQP3, AQP4, or AQP5 were subjected to swelling assays in the presence or absence of 100 μm TMA, TEA, TPrA, TBA, or TPeA. Determination of the Pfs revealed that, besides AQP1, the water permeability of AQP2 and AQP4 was inhibited by TEA to 49 ± 15 and 55 ± 18%, respectively (data not shown). In addition, the other four ammonium compounds did not have a significant inhibitory effect on the water permeability of AQP2 or AQP4, and the water permeability of AQP3 or AQP5 was not inhibited by any of the"

Cyclophilin D, a pore component, has catalytic activity as a peptidyl prolyl cis, trans-isomerase (PPIase), which is essential to the pore opening. It has been reported that cyclophilin D overexpression suppresses apoptosis in cancer cells. To clarify the mechanism of this effect, we generated glioma cells overexpressing wild-type or a PPIase-deficient mutant of cyclophilin D. Interestingly, we found that the PPIase-dependent apoptosis suppression by cyclophilin D correlated with the amounts of mitochondrial-bound hexokinase II, which has anti-apoptotic activity. Inactivation of endogenous cyclophilin D by small interference RNA or a cyclophilin inhibitor was found to release hexokinase II from mitochondria and to enhance Bax-mediated apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic effects of cyclophilin D were canceled out by the detachment of hexokinase II from mitochondria, demonstrating that mitochondrial binding of hexokinase II is essential to the apoptosis suppression by cyclophilin D. Furthermore, cyclophilin D dysfunction appears to abrogate hexokinase II-mediated apoptosis suppression, indicating that cyclophilin D is required for the anti-apoptotic activity of hexokinase II. Based on the above, we propose here that cyclophilin D suppresses apoptotic cell death via a mitochondrial hexokinase II-dependent mechanism in cancer cells.

Based on the above, we propose here that cyclophilin D suppresses apoptotic cell death via a mitochondrial hexokinase II-dependent mechanism in cancer cells. During apoptosis, the permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane is up-regulated, inducing a release of pro-apoptotic factors such as cytochrome c from the intermembrane space into the cytosol. Once cytochrome c is released from mitochondria, it binds to Apaf-1 and promotes the assembly of apoptosome multiprotein complex, which induces activation of the caspase-9 cell death protease (1Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). It has been believed that a mitochondrial protein complex called the permeability transition (PT) 2The abbreviations used are: PT, permeability transition; VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channel; ANT, adenine nucleotide translocase; PPIase, peptidyl prolyl cis, trans-isomerase; CTZ, clotrimazole; CsA, cyclosporin A; siRNA, small interference RNA; HA, hemagglutinin; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. pore, which is composed of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), cyclophilin D, and hexokinase, mediates the permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and cytochrome c release (2Beutner G. Rück A. Riede B. Brdiczka D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1368: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Cyclophilin D, which is a peptidyl prolyl-cis, trans-isomerase (PPIase), has been considered to be a promoter of pore opening. It has been reported that cyclophilin inhibitors such as cyclosporin A (3Halestrap A.P. Davidson A.M. Biochem.

Chem. 2002; 277: 34793-34799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) block the opening of the PT pore. Moreover, recent reports clearly show that mitochondria isolated from cyclophilin D null mice are resistant to the permeability transition (5Nakagawa T. Shimizu S. Watanabe T. Yamaguchi O. Otsu K.

Thus, cyclophilin D is now regarded as a key factor in the regulation of pore function. When the PT pore opens in vitro, mitochondria swell, the outer membrane is disrupted, and cytochrome c is released (9Ravagnan L. Marzo I. Costantini P. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Petit P.X. Hirsch F.

However, during apoptosis cytochrome c release is observed without the permeability transition (11Shimizu S. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Indeed, consistent with these observations, cyclophilin D null fibroblasts are not protected from Bax-dependent apoptosis (5Nakagawa T. Shimizu S. Watanabe T. Yamaguchi O. Otsu K. Yamagata H.

Therefore, the opening of the PT pore appears to not be essential to Bax-induced apoptosis. However, although the opening of the PT pore is not a trigger of apoptosis, components of the pore are involved in apoptosis as targets or suppressors against pro-apoptotic factors. For instance, VDAC, which is a primary component of the pore, is recognized as a target of pro-apoptotic protein Bax (13Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y.

VDAC may play a role in regulating cytochrome c release by forming, together with Bax, a highly conductive channel (14Shimizu S. Matsuoka Y. Shinohara Y. Yoneda Y. Tsujimoto Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that Bax promotes cytochrome c release and apoptosis through interactions with the ANT (15Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Jürgensmeier J.M. Susin S.A. Vieira H.L. Prévost M.C. Xie Z. Matsuyama S. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. Science. 1998; 281: 2027-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Hexokinase II, which catalyzes glucose phosphorylation, is overexpressed in cancer cells and plays a pivotal role in cellular proliferation and survival (16Pedersen P.L. Mathupala S. Rempel A. Geschwind J.F. Ko Y.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Hexokinase II appears to antagonize the mitochondrial translocation of Bax by inhibiting the molecular interaction between Bax and VDAC (17Pastorino J.G. Shulga N. Hoek J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7610-7618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mitochondrial binding of hexokinase II seems to play an essential role in the anti-apoptotic mechanism of cancer cells. It has been reported that cyclophilin D suppresses apoptosis when it is overexpressed (18Lin D.T. Lechleiter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31134-31141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 19Schubert A. Grimm S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20Li Y. Johnson N. Capano M. Edwards M. Crompton M. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, whether its PPIase activity is essential remains unknown, as is the mechanism of the anti-apoptotic effect of cyclophilin D. In the present study, we investigated the influences of cyclophilin D overexpression or its dysfunction on constituents of the PT pore complex. We found that cyclophilin D stabilizes hexokinase II mitochondrial binding by its PPIase activity. Our findings demonstrate that hexokinase II mitochondrial binding is essential to apoptosis suppression by cyclophilin D. Reagents—Cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 were purchased from Calbiochem. Adriamycin, A23187, DEVD-AMC, clotrimazole (CTZ), a protease inhibitor mixture (P8340), and digitonin were from Sigma. Bax-inhibiting peptide V5 and negative control peptide were from Calbiochem. Succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-4-nitroanilide was from Peptide Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Cell Cultures and the Generation of Stable Cell Lines—HeLa and C6 cells were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 200 μg/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. C6 cell lines expressing HA-tagged fusion cyclophilin D proteins were obtained by plasmid transfection using Effectene reagents (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). After 48 h of transfection, the cells were transferred to medium containing 800 μg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen). Surviving cells were grown for 2–3 weeks, and colonies were picked. The protein expression of HA-cyclophilin D was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody. Bax-induced Apoptosis—HeLa cells (6 × 104 cells/well of a 12-well plate) were precultured for 24 h, and then the cells were transfected with pCI-Bax or empty vector using transfection reagent Trans-It-LT1 (Mirus Bio Corp., Madison, WI). At 18 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with or without reagents (1 μm CsA, 10 μm CTZ, and 1 μm FK506) for 6 h. Cells were then collected, and caspase-3 activity was measured. Reagents were dissolved in Me2SO, and the concentration of Me2SO in culture medium was 0.1% (v/v). Measurement of Caspase-3 Activity—Cells were solubilized in buffer (20 mm Pipes, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS) at 4 °C for 10 min. The caspase-3-like protease activity of each sample was measured as described (21Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 91-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Substrate (DEVD-aminomethylcoumarin) cleavage to release free AMC (excitation 355, emission 460 nm) was monitored with a spectrophotometer Wallac 1420 ARVO SX (GE Healthcare Life Science). Data are represented as the means ± S.D. of separate experiments. Statistical significance was determined utilizing a one-way analysis of variance followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test. A value of p <0.01 was considered statistically significant. Cytochrome c Release and Bax Mitochondrial Translocation—Cytochrome c release and Bax translocation to mitochondria during apoptosis were analyzed as described (22Jiang S. Cai J. Wallace D.C. Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29905-29911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were suspended in the buffer (70 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 250 mm sucrose, 0.05 mg/ml of digitonin) and incubated for 10 min. The cells were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Precipitation (mitochondria-rich fraction) and cytosolic supernatant were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-cytochrome c antibody or anti-Bax antibodies. RNA Interference—A 21-nucleotide RNA duplex with 3′-deoxythymidine overhang corresponding to human cyclophilin D (NM_005729) was purchased from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX). The RNA sequences (siRNA 1) were as follows: sense 5′-GGCAGAUGUCGUCCCAAAGtt-3′, antisense 5′-CUUUGGGACGACAUCUGCCtt-3′ For specific down-regulation of endogenous cyclophilin D, we also used RNA duplex that binds the 3′-untranslated region of cyclophilin D mRNA. The RNA sequences (siRNA 2) were as follows: sense 5′-GGACUCUAAUACCUGUUUAtt-3′, antisense 5′-UAAACAGGUAUUAGAGUCCtt-3′. Endogenous Bax was down-regulated by Stealth siRNA duplex oligoribonucleotides from Invitrogen. The RNA sequences were as follows: sense 5′-UUGAGCACCAGUUUGCUGGCAAAGU-3′, antisense 5′-ACUUUGCCAGCAAACUGGUGCUCAA-3′. A luciferase GL2 siRNA duplex (Dharmacon Research, Inc., Lafayette, CO) was used as a control siRNA. Each siRNA (50 nm) was introduced into HeLa cells with Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Subcellular Fractionation—Mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were isolated from C6 or HeLa cells as described (17Pastorino J.G. Shulga N. Hoek J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7610-7618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were mechanically disrupted by 20 strokes with 26-gauge needles in 200 μlof isolation buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μl of protease inhibitor mixture). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 1,200 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Pellets of enriched mitochondria and cytosolic supernatants were obtained and used for the assays. Immunoblotting—Monoclonal antibody against cytochrome c (clone 7H8.2C12) and mouse monoclonal anti-HSP60 antibody were from BD Biosciences. Anti-α-tubulin (DM1A) was from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against HA tag (Y-11), polyclonal antibody against ANT (Q-18), Hexokinase II (C-14), Bax (N-19), and monoclonal antibody against HA tag (F-7) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-VDAC monoclonal antibody (31HL) and anti-cyclophilin D polyclonal antibody were from Calbiochem. Anti-cyclophilin A polyclonal antibodies were from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions (Charlottesville, VA). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were seeded on coverslips, fixed with 3.7% glutaraldehyde for 5 min, and treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. The cells were then incubated with primary antibodies (mouse anti-HSP60 antibodies and rabbit anti-HA polyclonal antibodies) for 60 min. All cells were washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline before 60 min of incubation with secondary antibodies, anti-mouse Alexa 488 and anti-rabbit Alexa 594 from Invitrogen. Images were captured with a fluorescence microscope (BX-60, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed with image-processing software (Aquacosmos, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). Plasmids and Transfection—To generate HA-cyclophilin D, we inserted the HA-tagged amino acids (AYPYDVPDYA) between the predicted N-terminal mitochondrial-targeting signal residues (1Li P. Nijhawan D.

Each segment of cyclophilin D was amplified by primer sets (5′-primer 5′-GCGGGATCCATGCTGGCGCTGCGCTG-3′ and 3′-primer 5′-CAAGAATTCCGGAGCCCTTGCTGCAGGCGCC-3′) and (5′-primer 5′-CCGGAATTCTTGCCTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTGACCCGTCCTCTTCCTCCTCCTCC-3′ and 3′-primer 5′-CAATCTAGATTAGCTCAACTGGCCACAGTC-3′). For the PCR reactions, the previously cloned human cyclophilin D gene (23Machida K. Hayashi Y. Osada H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31243-31248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was used as a template. Each PCR product was subcloned into pcDNA3.1B (+) (Invitrogen). Cyclophilin D mutants R97A and H168Q were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using primer sets (5′-primer 5′-ACAAAGGCTCCACCTTCCACGCGCAC-3′ and 3′-primer 5′-CACCGCGTGGAAGGTGGAGCCTTTGT-3′) and (5′-primer 5′-GGATGGCAAGCAGGTTGTGTTCGGTC-3′ and 3′-primer 5′-GACCGAACACAACCTGCTTGCCATCC-3′), respectively. Glutathione S-transferase-cyclophilin D fusion protein was prepared as described previously (23Machida K. Hayashi Y. Osada H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31243-31248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). PPIase activity was measured using a synthetic peptide, succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-4-nitroanilide, as a substrate in a two-step reaction coupled to chymotrypsin (24Kofron J.L. Kuzmic P. Kishore V. Colón-Bonilla E. Rich D.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6127-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). pCI-Bax, used for the Bax transient expression assay, was kindly provided by Dr. S. Simizu, RIKEN. Human hexokinase II was amplified from skeletal muscle cDNA (Invitrogen). The hexokinase II gene was amplified using specific primers (5′-primer 5′-GGATCCATGATTGCCTCGCATCTGCTTGCC-3′ and 3′-primer 5′-CTCTAGACTCTATCGCTGTCCAGCCTCACG-3′). The PCR product was cloned and found to be identical to the sequences reported previously (GenBank™ NM_000189). The C-terminal Myc-tagged fusion hexokinase II was generated by PCR using primers (5′-primer 5′-GGATCCATGATTGCCTCGCATCTGCTTGCC-3′ and 3′ primer CTCTAGACTTCGCTGTCCAGCCTCACGGAT-3′). The PCR product was subcloned into pcDNA3.1B (+). Both cyclophilin D and hexokinase II expression vectors were transiently introduced into HeLa cells (8 × 104 cells/well of a 12-well plate) using Effectene reagents (Qiagen). Establishing a Stable Cell Line with Overexpressed Wild-type or PPIase-deficient Cyclophilin D—We generated PPIase-deficient mutants (R97A and H168Q) of cyclophilin D to address whether the PPIase activity of cyclophilin D is essential. In accordance with previous reports (18Lin D.T. Lechleiter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31134-31141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), both R97A and H168Q mutants completely lost their PPIase activity (Fig. 1A). It has been reported that cyclophilin D binds to the ANT in vitro (25Woodfield K. Rück A. Brdiczka D. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 26Crompton M. Virji S. Ward J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), indicating that cyclophilin D may associate with the ANT and thus regulate the opening of the PT pore. As shown in Fig. 1B, binding of cyclophilin D to the ANT was independent of its PPIase activity, which is consistent with previous observations (18Lin D.T. Lechleiter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31134-31141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Therefore, we expected that the cyclophilin D mutants (R97A and H168Q) could inhibit endogenous cyclophilin D when they were overexpressed in cancer cells. The C6 rat glioma cell line had smaller amounts of endogenous cyclophilin D protein than other tumor cell lines (data not shown). We therefore generated the C6 glioma cell line stably overexpressing wild-type or mutant cyclophilin D in their mitochondria. We confirmed that the introduced cyclophilin D proteins were successfully transferred to mitochondria (Fig. 1, C and D). It was observed that total protein levels of PPIase-deficient mutants were less than that of wild-type cyclophilin D (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1). These observations indicate that PPIase-deficient cyclophilin D proteins are unstable or slightly toxic to tumor cells. Cyclophilin D Suppressed Apoptosis, whereas PPIase-deficient Cyclophilin D Sensitized Cells against Apoptosis—We investigated the effects of cyclophilin D overexpression on apoptosis induction by an anti-tumor reagent, adriamycin. This anti-cancer reagent has been reported to induce Bax-dependent cytochrome c release and apoptosis (27Panaretakis T. Pokrovskaja K. Shoshan M.C. Grandér D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44317-44326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, overexpression of wild-type cyclophilin D protected the cells from adriamycin-induced caspase-3 activation. Expectedly, overexpression of the PPIase-deficient mutants enhanced the caspase-3 activation (Fig. 2B), cytochrome c release, and the Bax mitochondrial translocation induced by adriamycin (Fig. 2C). We confirmed that other stable clones with PPIase-deficient cyclophilin D were sensitive to adriamycin (see supplemental Fig. S1). These results demonstrate that the anti-apoptotic activity of cyclophilin D is dependent on its PPIase activity. To clarify the role of Bax in apoptotic cell death, we investigated the effects of Bax-inhibiting peptide, which is derived from the Bax-binding domain of Ku70 (28Sawada M. Hayes P. Matsuyama S. Nature Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), on the caspase-3 activation by adriamycin. We pretreated the cells expressing PPIase-deficient cyclophilin D (R97A and H168Q) with Bax-inhibiting peptide or negative control peptide, and then adriamycin was added. As shown in Fig. 2D, Bax-inhibiting peptide attenuated the pro-apoptotic effect of adriamycin, but negative control peptide did not. This observation suggests that Bax plays a central role in the defective cyclophilin D-mediated sensitization to apoptosis. Cyclophilin D Stabilized Mitochondrial Binding of Hexokinase II— Because cyclophilin D is a component of the PT pore, we next analyzed the pore constitution among the cyclophilin D-overexpressed cells. Fig. 3A shows that overexpression of wild-type cyclophilin D increases the levels of mitochondrial-bound hexokinase II, whereas that of mutant cyclophilin D reduces these levels. Other pore components (VDAC and ANT) and a mitochondrial chaperon, HSP60, are not affected by overexpression of cyclophilin D. These observations suggest that cyclophilin D maintains hexokinase II mitochondrial binding by its PPIase activity. As shown in Fig. 3B, CTZ, which has been reported to inhibit mitochondrial binding of hexokinase II (17Pastorino J.G. Shulga N. Hoek J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7610-7618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), dissociated hexokinase II from mitochondria. When the cells were treated with CTZ, the anti-apoptotic activity of cyclophilin D was diminished (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that hexokinase II mitochondrial binding is important to the anti-apoptotic activity of cyclophilin D. Cyclosporin A Released Hexokinase II from Mitochondria—We investigated the effects of CsA, a specific inhibitor of cyclophilin protein, on hexokinase II mitochondrial binding. Expectedly, CsA released hexokinase II from mitochondria as CTZ did, but FK506 did not (Fig. 4A). CsA also inhibits calcineurin, a serine/threonine protein phosphatase. Because FK506, an inhibitor of calcineurin, did not release hexokinase II from mitochondria, the effects of CsA on calcineurin can be excluded from the hexokinase II release induction. We next investigated the effects of CsA on Bax-induced apoptosis. It has previously been reported that CTZ enhances Bax-induced apoptosis by detaching hexokinase II from mitochondria (17Pastorino J.G. Shulga N. Hoek J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7610-7618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Fig. 4B shows that CsA, but not FK506, enhanced the caspase-3 activation induced by transient expression of Bax. Moreover, CsA enhanced the Bax mitochondrial translocation (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that CsA enhances Bax-induced apoptosis through inhibition of hexokinase II mitochondrial binding.

https://openalex.org/W1999974789,"Lactococcus lactis is a gram-positive bacterium widely used by the dairy industry. Several industrial L. lactis strains are sensitive to various distinct bacteriophages. Most of them belong to the Siphoviridae family and comprise several species, among which the 936 and P335 are prominent. Members of these two phage species recognize their hosts through the interaction of their receptor-binding protein (RBP) with external cell wall saccharidices of the host, the ""receptors."" We report here the 1.65 A resolution crystal structure of the RBP from phage TP901-1, a member of the P335 species. This RBP of 163 amino acids is a homotrimer comprising three domains: a helical N terminus, an interlaced beta-prism, and a beta-barrel, the head domain (residues 64-163), which binds a glycerol molecule. Fluorescence quenching experiments indicated that the RBP exhibits high affinity for glycerol, muramyl-dipeptide, and other saccharides in solution. The structural comparison of this RBP with that of lactococcal phage p2 RBP, a member of the 936 species (Spinelli, S., Desmyter, A., Verrips, C. T., de Haard, J. W., Moineau, S., and Cambillau, C. (2006) Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 13, 85-89) suggests a large extent of modularity in RBPs of lactococcal phages."
https://openalex.org/W1985198009,"The GSH/glutaredoxin (GRX) system is involved in the redox regulation of certain enzyme activities, and this system protects cells from H2O2-induced apoptosis by regulating the redox state of Akt (Murata, H., Ihara, Y., Nakamura, H., Yodoi, J., Sumikawa, K., and Kondo, T. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 50226–50233). Estrogens, such as 17β-estradiol (E2), play an important role in development, growth, and differentiation and appear to have protective effects on oxidative stress mediated by estrogen receptor α (ERα). However, the role of the ERβ-mediated pathway in this cytoprotection and the involvement of E2 in the redox regulation are not well understood. In the present study, we demonstrated that E2 protected cardiac H9c2 cells, expressing ERβ from H2O2-induced apoptosis concomitant with an increase in the activity of Akt. E2 induced the expression of glutaredoxin (GRX) as well as γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, a rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of GSH. Inhibitors for both γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase and GRX and ICI182,780, a specific inhibitor of ERs, abolished the protective effect of E2 on cell survival as well as the activity of Akt, suggesting that ERβ is involved in the cytoprotection and redox regulation by E2. Transcription of the GRX gene was enhanced by E2. The promoter activity of GRX was up-regulated by an ERβ-dependent element. These results suggest that the GRX/GSH system is involved in the cytoprotective and genomic effects of E2 on the redox state of Akt, a pathway that is mediated, at least in part, by ERβ. This mechanism may also play an antiapoptotic role in cancer cells during carcinogenesis or chemotherapy. The GSH/glutaredoxin (GRX) system is involved in the redox regulation of certain enzyme activities, and this system protects cells from H2O2-induced apoptosis by regulating the redox state of Akt (Murata, H., Ihara, Y., Nakamura, H., Yodoi, J., Sumikawa, K., and Kondo, T. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 50226–50233). Estrogens, such as 17β-estradiol (E2), play an important role in development, growth, and differentiation and appear to have protective effects on oxidative stress mediated by estrogen receptor α (ERα). However, the role of the ERβ-mediated pathway in this cytoprotection and the involvement of E2 in the redox regulation are not well understood. In the present study, we demonstrated that E2 protected cardiac H9c2 cells, expressing ERβ from H2O2-induced apoptosis concomitant with an increase in the activity of Akt. E2 induced the expression of glutaredoxin (GRX) as well as γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, a rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of GSH. Inhibitors for both γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase and GRX and ICI182,780, a specific inhibitor of ERs, abolished the protective effect of E2 on cell survival as well as the activity of Akt, suggesting that ERβ is involved in the cytoprotection and redox regulation by E2. Transcription of the GRX gene was enhanced by E2. The promoter activity of GRX was up-regulated by an ERβ-dependent element. These results suggest that the GRX/GSH system is involved in the cytoprotective and genomic effects of E2 on the redox state of Akt, a pathway that is mediated, at least in part, by ERβ. This mechanism may also play an antiapoptotic role in cancer cells during carcinogenesis or chemotherapy. Oxidative stress is a principle cause of the development of aging and diseases such as inflammation, infection, cancer, and cardiovascular disorders (1Berlett S.B. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar, 2Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7346) Google Scholar). Exogenous or endogenous sources of oxidative stress and weakened antioxidative defenses can damage macromolecules such as DNA, lipids, and proteins. Estrogens play an important role in development, growth, and the differentiation of both female and male secondary sex characteristics (3Yang S.H. Liu R. Perez E.J. Wen Y. Stevens S.M. Jr-Valencia T. Brun-Zinkernagel A.M. Prokai L. Will Y. Dykens J. Koulen P. Simpkins J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4130-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar).

E2 regulates longevity signals to enhance resistance to oxidative stress in mice. Inhibitory effects of E2 on atherosclerosis are mediated by COX-2-derived prostacyclin (5Egan K.M. Lawson J.A. Fries S. Koller B. Rader D.J. Smyth E.M. Fitzgerald G.A. Science. 2004; 306: 1954-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). E2 induces production of antioxidative enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (6Strehlow K. Rotter S. Wassmann S. Adam O. Grohe C. Laufs K. Bohm M. Nickenig G. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS), and glutathione S-transferase (7Montano M.M. Deng H. Liu M. Sun X. Singal R. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2442-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The effects of E2 are mediated mostly through ERα, which functions as a ligand-induced transcription factor and belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily (8Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). ERα binds to a variety of ligands and displays tissue-specific effects through estrogen-response element (ERE). When estrogen-responsive genes do not contain EREs, ERα can up-regulate gene expression through AP-1 and Sp1 sites (9Schultz J.R. Petz L.N. Nardulli A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Another ER, ERβ, is expressed in cells targeted by E2, including cardiomyocytes (10Foster C. Keitz S. Hultenby K. Warner M. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14234-14239Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the role of ERβ in protection against oxidative stress has not been well studied. Protein thiols act as redox-sensitive switches and are believed to be a key element in maintaining the cellular redox balance. The redox state of protein thiols is regulated by oxidative stress and redox signaling and important to cellular functions. To maintain the cellular thiol-disulfide redox status, living cells possess two major systems, the thioredoxin (TRX)/TRX reductase system and the glutathione (γ-glutamylcysteinyl glycine, GSH)/glutaredoxin (GRX) system (11Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GSH is synthesized in two sequential enzymatic reactions that are each catalyzed by a rate-limiting enzyme, γ-GCS, and GSH synthetase (12Meister A. Science. 1973; 180: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). GRX, also known as thioltransferase, was first discovered as a GSH-dependent hydrogen donor for ribonucleotide reductase in Escherichia coli mutants lacking TRX (13Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Oxidized GRX is recycled to the reduced form by GSH with the formation of glutathione disulfide and regeneration of GSH by coupling with NADPH and glutathione disulfide reductase (14Gan Z.-R. Wells W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 996-1001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GRX functions via a disulfide exchange reaction by utilizing the active site, Cys-Pro-Tyr-Cys, which specifically and efficiently catalyzes the reduction of protein-SSG mixed disulfide (15Gravina S.A. Mieyal J.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3368-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). GRX also partially shares its function as a redox sensor with TRX (16Song J.J. Rhee J.G. Suntharalingam M. Walsh S.A. Spitz D.R. Lee Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46566-46575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 17Song J.J. Lee Y.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 845-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Recently, we have found that GRX protects against oxidative stress-induced cell death from apoptosis by regulating the redox state of Akt (18Murata H. Ihara Y. Nakamura H. Yodoi J. Sumikawa K. Kondo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50226-50233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Akt/protein kinase B is a pleckstrin homology domain-containing serine/threonine kinase and a critical component of an intracellular signaling pathway that exerts effects on survival and apoptosis (19Huang X. Begley M. Morgenstern K.A. Gu Y. Rose P. Zhao H. Zhu X. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 21-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Akt has been found to be responsive to extracellular signaling factors, oxidative and osmotic stress, irradiation, and ischemic stress (20Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Akt can phosphorylate Bad, caspase-9, and forkhead-related transcription factors, leading to an inhibition of apoptosis (21Franke T.F. Hornik C.P. Segev L. Shostak G.A. Sugimoto C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8983-8998Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). The unphosphorylated form of Akt is virtually inactive, and phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473 stimulates its activity. Inactivation of Akt also occurs via dephosphorylation of the two phosphorylation sites by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (22Luikenhuis S. Perrone G. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 23Andjelkovic M. Jakubowicz T. Cron P. Ming X.F. Han J.W. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The activation of Akt contributes to the survival of H2O2-treated cells (24Pham F.H. Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1252-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the function of ER-mediated transcriptional activity is regulated by redox (25Hayashi S. Hajiro-Nakanishi K. Makino Y. Eguchi H. Yodoi J. Tanaka H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4035-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanisms of redox regulation in the E2-mediated signal pathways have not been clarified. Here we describe a mechanism for the antiapoptotic effect of E2 through the regulation of the redox state of Akt under oxidative stress. Treatment of cardiac H9c2 cells with E2 for 18 h protected against H2O2-induced apoptosis. E2 induced the expression of GRX andγ-GCS, at least in part, through ERβ-mediated regulation. Elevated GSH and GRX levels potentiated the redox of Akt on the exposure of cells to H2O2. Reagents—Anti-PP2A scaffolding A subunit (PR65) antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against human ERα (clone ER88) and ERβ (polyclonal) were from Kyowa Medex (Tokyo, Japan). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG F was purchased from MBL (Nagoya, Japan). HRP-goat anti-mouse IgG F was from Chemicon International (Temocula, CA). Normal goat IgG, normal rabbit IgG, and normal mouse IgG were from Sigma. Anti-Akt and anti-phospho-(Ser473)-Akt antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-PP2A catalytic C subunit antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories. 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was from Sigma. 4-Acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS) was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). H2O2 and CdCl2 were from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). ICI182,780 and propylpyrazoletriol (PPT) were from Tocris (Ballwin, MO). Cell Culture—H9c2 cells, a clonal line derived from embryonic rat heart, and human breast cancer SK-BR-3 (SKB3) cells, and MDA-MB-231 (MDA) cells, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL-1446). Human breast cancer MCF7 cells were from The Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research Institute of Development, Aging, and Cancer, Tohoku University (Sendai, Japan). H9c2 cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, or MDA and SKB3 cells were maintained in RPMI1640 medium. The cells were supplied with 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C (23Andjelkovic M. Jakubowicz T. Cron P. Ming X.F. Han J.W. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Cell Viability—Cell viability was determined by a MTT assay as described (26Goto S. Kamada K. Soh Y. Ihara Y. Kondo T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 2002; 93: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (1500–5000) were placed in 100 μl of medium per well in 96-well plates. Four hours after treatment with various concentrations of H2O2, the cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-e-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (652 μg/ml) and lysed with 100 μl of 20% SDS, 50% N,N-dimethylformamide (pH 4.7) in each well. After an overnight incubation at 37 °C, the absorbance at 570 nm was measured. Wells without cells served as blanks. Nuclear Condensation—For the histochemical analysis, cells were maintained in a four-well Lab Tec Chamber (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL). After treatment with H2O2, cells were treated with 10 μm Hoechst 33342 for 30 min to estimate the extent of nuclear condensation. They were then washed again with PBS. Fluorescence intensity was examined using an Axioskop2 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany), and the findings were analyzed using a charge-coupled device camera (Axio-Cam) and AxioVision software. Morphological Staining—The immunohistochemical analysis to examine the expression of ERα and ERβ was performed as described previously (27Tamaru N. Hishikawa Y. Ejima K. Nagasue N. Inoue S. Muramatsu M. Hayashi T. Koji T. Lab. Invest. 2004; 84: 1460-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and then preincubated with blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. For ERβ 10% normal goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS and for ERα 500 μg/ml of normal goat IgG and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS were used, respectively. Next, the samples were incubated with the primary antibodies overnight and washed three times with 0.075% Brij 35 in PBS. Then samples were reacted with HRP-goat anti-mouse IgG or HRP-goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with 0.075% Brij 35 in PBS. HRP sites were visualized with H2O2 and DAB solution or H2O2 and DAB in the presence of nickel and cobalt ions. As a negative control, normal rabbit IgG and normal mouse IgG were used instead of the primary antibodies. The results of immunohistochemistry for ERs were graded as positive or negative, compared with the staining with IgG or serum of a normal rabbit or mouse. Immunoblot Analysis—Cultured cells were harvested and lysed for 20 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer as described previously (17Song J.J. Lee Y.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 845-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The supernatants obtained by centrifugation of the lysates at 8000 × g for 15 min were used in subsequent experiments. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA assay kit (Pierce). Protein samples were electrophoresed on 10, 12.5, or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions, except for thiol-modified protein samples. The proteins in the gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.15 m NaCl; TBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (v/v) (TBST) and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk and then reacted with primary antibodies in TBST containing 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin overnight with constant agitation at 4 °C. After several washes with TBST, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG antibodies. Proteins in the membranes were then visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Akt Activity Assay—Akt activity was assayed using an Akt assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology) according to the manufacturer's directions with GSK3α/β fusion protein (GSK3α/β) as a substrate. Phosphorylation of GSK3α/β was assessed by immunoblot analysis using a specific antibody. Briefly, Akt was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using the anti-Akt antibody, and then the immunoprecipitates were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in an assay mixture containing GSK3α/β. Phosphorylated proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes to detect phosphorylated GSK3α/β using an anti-phosphorylated GSK3α/β antibody. Protein Phosphatase Assay—PP2A activity was assayed spectrophotometrically using a Ser/Thr phosphatase assay kit 1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The phosphopeptide RKpTIRR and p-nitrophenyl phosphate were used as phosphatase substrates. Determination of Redox States—The redox states of proteins were assessed by modifying free thiol with AMS (28Kobayashi T. Kishigami S. Sone M. Inokuchi H. Mogi T. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11857-11862Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Briefly, after incubation with or without H2O2, cell lysates or proteins were treated with trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 7.5% to denature and precipitate the proteins as well as to avoid any subsequent redox reactions. The protein precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were rinsed in acetone and centrifuged twice and then dissolved in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% SDS, and 15 mm AMS. Proteins were then separated by 10% SDS-PAGE without using any reducing agents and blotted to nitrocellulose membranes. Proteins in the membranes were visualized by immunoblotting as described above. Northern Blot Analysis—A 764-bp DNA fragment (bp 865–1628) of full-length γ-GCS heavy subunit cDNA was obtained by digestion with PstI (29Iida T. Kijima H. Urata Y. Goto S. Ihara Y. Oka M. Kohno S. Scanlon K.J. Kondo T. Cancer Gene Ther. 2001; 8: 803-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The probes were radiolabeled with 32P using a random primer labeling kit (Takara Biomedicals, Shiga, Japan). The isolation of cytoplasmic RNA and Northern blotting were essentially performed as described by Sambrook et al. (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Isolated RNAs (30 μg) were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing 0.6 m formaldehyde, transferred to a nylon membrane, and then hybridized with 32P-labeled probes. Autoradiographed membranes were analyzed using a BAS5000 bioimage analyzer (Fuji Photo Film). A specific system for the amplification of mRNA was also used: an mRNA-selective PCR kit (Takara-Biomedicals; distributed by BioWhittaker, Europe). It had a total volume of 25 μl, comprising 12.5 μl of 2× buffer II, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm PE1 and PE2, 1 mm each dNTP, 0.4 units of RNAsin (40 units/μl), 0.5 units of Rtase XL (5 units/μl), and 0.5 units of optimized Taq. As material, 1 μg of total RNA extracted from the cells was used. The 330-bp oligonucleotides for GRX (rat GRX sequence, accession number AF167981) were obtained using as a sense primer 5′-GCA TGG CTC AGG AGT TTG TGA ACT GCA AGA TTC AG-3′ and, as an antisense primer, 5′-CCT TTC ATA ACT GCA GAG CTC CAA TCT GCT TCA GC-3′. The 410-bp oligonucleotides for β-actin (rat β-actin sequence, accession number BC063166) were obtained using 5′-GAG CTA TGA GCT GCC TGA CG-3′ and 5′-AGC ATT TGC GGT GCA CGA TG-3′. The 410-bp oligonucleotides for β-actin (human β-actin sequence, accession number NM_001101.2) were obtained using 5′-GAG CTA CGA GCT GCC TGA CG-3′ and 5′-AGC ATT TGC GGT GCA CGA TG-3′. The 325-β oligonucleotides for ERα (rat ERα sequence, accession number AY280663.1) and 280-bp oligonucleotides for ERβ (rat ERβ sequence, accession number U57439) were obtained using 5′-GCT CTT GAC AAA CCC A-3′ and 5′-GCG GCG TTG AAC TCG TAG-3′ and 5′-GGC TGA GGA AAG CAC CTG TC-3′ and 5′-GCG GCG TTG AAC TCG TAG-3′, respectively. Similarly, the sense and antisense primers for the oligonucleotides for human ERα (accession number NM_000125.2) were 5′-GAC TAT GCT TCA GGC TAC C-5′ and 5′-GGT TCC TGT CCA AGA GCA AG-3′, whereas those for human ERβ (accession number NM_001437.1) were 5′-GTG GTC CAT CGC CAG TTA TC-3′ and 5′-GCA CTT CTC TGT CTC CGC AC-3′, respectively. The RT-amplification was carried out as follows: 30 min at 50 °C for the reverse transcription, denaturation for 5 min at 95 °C, and then a succession of 23 (35 for ERs) cycles as follows: 30 s at 95 °C, 40 s at 65 °C (55 °C for ERs), and 90 s at 72 °C. Amplification took place after 5 min at 72 °C. Determination of Cellular Glutathione Levels—Total GSH and GSSG levels were measured using a total glutathione quantification kit (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's directions. Briefly, 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and GSH react to generate 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic acid. The concentration of GSH in the sample solution was determined by measuring absorbance at 412 nm. For quantification of GSSG, cell lysates were treated with 2-vinylpyridine and triethanolamine to block the sulfhydryl residue of GSH. GSSG in the sample solution was reduced to GSH using a reducing mixture containing GSSG reductase and NADPH, and the levels of GSSG were determined photometrically as for GSH. 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent Protein Kinase-1 Activity—3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) activity was estimated using an assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, recombinant human active PDK1 (Upstate Biotechnology) protein was incubated first with inhibitors for 30 min at 30 °C and then with inactive glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) for 30 min at 30 °C. Next, the PDK1-dependent SGK1 kinase activity was estimated by incubating the reaction mixture with glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) peptide as a substrate for 10 min at 30 °C in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Generation of Luciferase Reporter Constructs—A 2.0-kb fragment of the human GRX gene promoter (–2023 to –22) (31Padilla C.A. Bajalica S. Lagercrantz J. Holmgren A. Genomics. 1996; 32: 455-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using Pfu turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The primers used were as follows: a forward primer (5′-GGA CTG AGT GAG AGG CAG ACA ATA GTC TCC-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-CGG GAA GAA TCC TCA GTT GCA GGT ATT GCT TGG-3′). The PCR product was subcloned into pUC18 to obtain pUC18-pro-GRX. PUC18-pro-GRX was digested with HindIII, and the resulting fragment containing the promoter region from –2023 to –22 was inserted into the HindIII site of the reporter vector pGL3-Basic (Stratogene) to give pGL3-pro-GRX. To generate a deleted version of the luciferase reporter construct (pGL3-pro-GRX-del), pGL3-pro-GRX was digested with KpnI and PvuII (Takara Biomedicals). Site-directed mutagenesis for luciferase vectors was performed with pGL3-pro-GRX (–2023 to –22) as a template by using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The oligonucleotides used were as follows: electrophoretic response element (EpRE)-like 1 forward (5′-GCT CCC CCT CCG GGA CTC AGA ATC TGG-3′) and EpRE-like 1 reverse (5′-CCA GAT TCT GAG TCC CGG AGG GGG AGC-3′). The nucleotide sequence was confirmed by sequencing with an ALFexpress II system (Amersham Biosciences). Luciferase Activity Assay—Each vector was introduced into H9c2 cells by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 12 h of transfection, cells were harvested for 24 h and then treated with E2 (100 nm) or left untreated for 18 h. Then luciferase activity was assayed with cellular extracts by using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The electrophoretic mobility shift assay for the GC box and EpRE-like 1 element was performed as described (32Yasuoka C. Ihara Y. Ikeda S. Miyahara Y. Kondo T. Kohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51182-51192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligonucleotides were annealed to double-stranded oligonucleotides and then labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Oligonucleotides specific for the GC box and EpRE-like 1 element were prepared according to the nucleotide sequence of the human GRX promoter region. Oligonucleotides used were as follows: EpRE-like 1 element, 5′-CCC TCC GTG ACT CAG AAT CTG GCT TTC-3′; mutated EpRE-like 1 element, 5′-CCC TCC GGG ACT GTA AGC ACT TTA TGC TTC-3′. Binding reactions were performed in 15 μl of reaction mixture (25 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol) containing 10 μg of nuclear extract and 25 ng of labeled oligonucleotide. For the supershift assay, specific antibodies were added to the reaction mixture during the binding reaction for 30 min. Statistical Analysis—Data were presented as means ± S.D. Differences were examined by using Student's t test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Expression of ERs—The expression of ERs in H9c2 cells was estimated immunohistochemically and genetically. Fig. 1 shows the results of the immunohistochemical analysis. Unlike MCF7 cells, which are known to express both ERα (Fig. 1A) and ERβ (Fig. 1B), H9c2 cells expressed ERβ (Fig. 1F) but not ERα (Fig. 1E). Fig. 1I shows the results of the RT-PCR analysis. ERβ mRNA but not ERα mRNA was detected in H9c2 cells. On the other hand, both ER mRNAs were detected in MCF7 cells. Cytoprotective Effect of E2 on Oxidative Stress—We tested the cytoprotective effect of E2 on oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells. Hydrogen peroxide induces apoptosis or early mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiac H9c2 cells (32Yasuoka C. Ihara Y. Ikeda S. Miyahara Y. Kondo T. Kohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51182-51192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 33Prokai L. Prokai-Tatrai K. Perjesi P. Zharikova A.D. Perez E.J. Liu R. Simpkins J.W. Proc. Natl.

Since 10% fetal calf serum, required for maintaining cultured cells, reduces oxidative stress modification of cells, in order to observe the effect of E2 on H2O2-induced oxidative stress, the concentration of fetal calf serum in the medium was changed from 10 to 0.5% in the experiments that followed. As shown in Fig. 2A, the cell viability decreased by H2O2, as assessed photometrically with the MTT assay. The cell viability upon treatment with 100 μm H2O2 for 4 h was ∼27% of the control. Prior treatment of the cells with 100 and 200 nm E2 for 18 h prevented the H2O2 (100 μm)-induced cell damage by 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold of the control level, respectively (Fig. 2B). The increase in cell viability caused by E2 observed in 18 h continued until 24 h and then declined until 36 h (Fig. 2C). Morphologically, H2O2-induced DNA condensation was observed (Fig. 3, A versus E). E2 protected against DNA condensation (Fig. 3, B versus F). ICI182,780, an ER antagonist, abolished the protective effect of E2 (Fig. 3, C versus G). PPT (0.5 mm), a specific inhibitor of ERα, had no apparent influence on the protective effect of E2 (Fig. 3, D versus H). These results suggest that the protective effect against oxidative stress observed on treatment of the cells with E2 for 18 h involves transcriptional regulation mediated by ERβ through a genomic pathway in this cell line. Unless otherwise indicated, subsequent experiments on the effect of E2 were done by incubating the cells with 100 nm E2 for 18 h.FIGURE 3H2O2-induced nuclear condensation.

The reasons established so far for the Tat dependence are cytoplasmic cofactor assembly and/or heterodimerization of the respective proteins. We were interested in the reasons for the Tat dependence of novel Tat substrates and focused on two uncharacterized proteins, YcdO and YcdB. Both proteins contain predicted Tat signal sequences. However, we found that only YcdB was indeed Tat-dependently translocated, whereas YcdO was equally well translocated in a Tat-deficient strain.

In contrast to all other periplasmic hemoproteins analyzed so far, heme was assembled into YcdB in the cytoplasm, suggesting that heme assembly could take place prior to translocation. The function of YcdB in the periplasm may be related to a detoxification reaction under specific conditions because YcdB had peroxidase activity at acidic pH, which coincides well with the known acid-induced expression of the gene.

The Tat (twin-arginine translocation) system delivers folded proteins across biological membranes (1Müller M. Klösgen R.B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). So far, the functional Tat systems from bacterial cytoplasmic membranes and plant plastid thylakoid membranes have been characterized (1Müller M. Klösgen R.B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Transport is driven by the membrane potential, and the costs for translocation appear to be very high (2Alder N.N. Theg S.M. Cell. 2003; 112: 231-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), which could explain why many organisms prefer the less energy-consuming translocation of unfolded proteins via the Sec apparatus. The most complete Tat substrate analyses have been reported for Escherichia coli (3Berks B.C. Palmer T. Sargent F. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Many Tat substrates from E. coli are translocated as heterodimers or after cytoplasmic cofactor assembly; and therefore, they obviously need to be translocated in a folded conformation. However, even in this model organism, several postulated Tat substrates exist, the Tat dependence of which is neither established nor understood. Among these are YcdO and YcdB, two uncharacterized proteins with genes that appear to be organized in one operon with the gene ycdN, which encodes a putative metal ion transporter (4McHugh J.P. Rodríguez-Quiñones F. Abdul-Tehrani H. Svistunenko D.A. Poole R.K. Cooper C.E. Andrews S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29478-29486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In the E. coli K12 genome, ycdN seems to be largely truncated and may therefore form no functional gene product (5Blattner F.R. Plunkett G. II I Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (5972) Google Scholar). YcdO and YcdB are proteins of unknown function. In proteomic studies, YcdO has been shown to be periplasmic and more abundant at acidic pH (6Stancik L.M. Stancik D.M. Schmidt B. Barnhart D.M. Yoncheva Y.N. Slonczewski J.L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4246-4258Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, studies on global gene regulation have shown that the expression of the whole ycdNOB gene cluster is induced in response to acidic conditions (7Maurer L.M. Yohannes E. Bondurant S.S. Radmacher M. Slonczewski J.L. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 304-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). No further experimental work on YcdO or YcdB has been reported, but a similarity of YcdB to a dye-decolorizing peroxidase of the fungus Geotrichum candidum has been recognized by certain algorithms created at The Institute of Genomic Research (accession number TIGR01412).In this study, we aimed to analyze biochemically the uncharacterized putative E. coli Tat substrates YcdB and YcdO. While YcdO turned out not to be a Tat substrate, we found that YcdB is indeed translocated by the Tat system. YcdB contains a noncovalent heme cofactor, and this cofactor is assembled in the cytoplasm. The data demonstrate that YcdB is the first member of a new class of heme-containing Tat substrates with homologs in many bacterial species.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Growth Conditions—E. coli MC4100 (8Casadaban M.J.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and used for physiological experiments. E. coli XL1-Blue Mrf′ Kan (Stratagene) was used for cloning. Cells were grown aerobically on LB medium (1% Tryptone, 1% NaCl, and 0.5% yeast extract) in the presence of the appropriate antibiotics (100 μg/ml ampicillin and 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline).Plasmids and Genetic Methods—For expression of ycdO and ycdB, the corresponding genes were amplified by PCR with genomic DNA as template using primer pairs YcdO-NcoI-F (5′-GTC TCG CCA TGG CCA TTA ACT TCC GCC GTA ACG CA-3′)/YcdO-XhoI-R (5′-GCT TAC TCG AGT CCC AGC ACA CCG CGA AGT TG-3′) and YcdB-NcoI-F (5′-AAG CGC CAT GGA GTA TAA AGA TGA AAA CGG CGT GAA TG-3′)/YcdB-XhoI-R (5′-CAT TAC TCG AGC AAT AAC GCG CTT CCG AAA TAA TCG-3′), respectively. The PCR products were then restricted with NcoI and XhoI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pBAD-His, which is a derivative of pBAD22 (11Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3905) Google Scholar) with the hexahistidine tag-encoding sequence of pET22-b+ (Novagen) containing the XhoI site immediately before the His6 tag up to the ScaI site in the ampicillin resistance gene, thereby resulting in pBAD-ycdO-His6 and pBAD-ycdB-His6, respectively. For expression resulting in C-terminal Strep-tag II fusions of YcdO and YcdB, the Strep-tag II-encoding fragment was XhoI/ScaI-excised from pBAD-tatABC-Strep (10Berthelmann F. Brüser T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and cloned into the corresponding sites of pBAD-ycdO-His6 and pBAD-ycdB-His6, resulting in pBAD-ycdO-Strep and pBAD-ycdB-Strep, respectively.Biochemical Methods—YcdO and YcdB were purified by affinity chromatography using Strep-Tactin Superflow™ resin (IBA GmbH) following the manufacturer's protocol, but EDTA was generally omitted from buffers. Protein concentrations were determined according to Lowry et al. (12Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and SDS-PAGE analyses were carried out according to Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). For native gels, SDS was omitted from all buffers, and samples were not reduced. The YcdO or YcdB constructs were detected by Western blot analyses after SDS-PAGE as described previously (14Brüser T. Deutzmann R. Dahl C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 164: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) using either Strep-Tactin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (IBA GmbH) or anti-high potential iron-sulfur protein-His6 polyclonal antibodies (14Brüser T. Deutzmann R. Dahl C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 164: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionations were carried out as described previously (15Brüser T. Yano T. Brune D.C. Daldal F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The molecular masses of purified proteins were determined by electrospray mass spectrometry. The spectra were acquired with an ESI-Q-Tof 2 mass spectrometer (Waters Corp., Manchester, UK) equipped with a nanospray ion source. The samples were injected via a PicoTip (New Objective, Inc., Cambridge, MA) with a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. The MaxEnt™ 1 algorithm was used for deconvoluting the data to a single charge state. Analytical ultracentrifugation was carried out with YcdB at 0.4 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and with YcdO at 0.2 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4) in a Beckman Optima XL-A centrifuge equipped with an An50Ti rotor and double sector cells. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements were carried out at 20 °C and 15,000 rpm, and sedimentation velocity was monitored at 20 °C and 40,000 rpm. The data were recorded at wavelengths of 230, 280, and 405 nm and analyzed using the software provided by Beckman Instruments. Absorption data for kinetics and spectra were recorded with an Ultrospec 4000 spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences). When indicated, samples were reduced in the cuvettes with a few grains of sodium dithionite. Peroxidase activity was determined with 10 mm guaiacol and 10 mm H2O2. One unit corresponds to 1 μmol of guaiacol oxidized per min at 22 °C in the indicated buffer at 100 mm. The reaction was started by addition of enzyme. Tetraguaiacol formation was followed photometrically at 470 nm (ϵ470 nm = 26.6 mm–1 cm–1). For activity stains on native gels, gels were equilibrated with 100 mm sodium citrate (pH 4.0) and 100 μm dianisidine, and the peroxidase reaction was started by addition of 100 μm H2O2.RESULTSYcdB Is a Tat Substrate, whereas YcdO Is Not—YcdB from E. coli is distantly related to the dye-decolorizing peroxidase (DyP) 2The abbreviation used is: DyP, dye-decolorizing peroxidase. identified in the fungus G. candidum (16Kim S.J.

Microbiol. 2000; 66: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). There are bacterial DyP-like proteins in many bacterial species, but none of them has ever been biochemically analyzed. E. coli contains two of these DyP-like proteins, YfeX and YcdB, which share some sequence homology in their C-terminal halves. Of these, YcdB belongs to a subclass of DyP-like proteins with predicted Tat signal sequences, one member of which has been shown to be a Tat substrate in the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis (18Jongbloed J.D.H. Grieger U. Antelmann H. Hecker M. Nijland R. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 1319-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). YcdB was a clear candidate for a novel class of Tat substrates. We thus clarified the Tat dependence of YcdB in E. coli and carried out the first purification and biochemical characterization of a bacterial YcdB homolog.In Fig. 1A, the signal sequence of YcdB from E. coli is compared with those of YcdB homologs from species of other phyla, including α-Proteobacteria, β-Proteobacteria, bacilli, and Actinobacteria. As typically found for Tat substrates, YcdB homologs have rather long signal sequences with twin-arginine motifs at the end of a polar n-region of variable length, and the h-regions are rich in alanines and glycines (19Berks B.C. Sargent F. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 260-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The conservation of these Tat signal sequence characteristics suggested to us that YcdB is indeed very likely to be translocated in a folded state across the cytoplasmic membrane by the Tat system.When we analyzed the localization of recombinant YcdB in the cell, we detected mature YcdB in the periplasmic fraction (Fig. 1B). The co-detection of the biotin carrier protein in the cytoplasm showed, as an internal control on the same blot, that no cytoplasm was leaking into the periplasmic fraction. Therefore, although the amount of periplasmic YcdB was rather low under these conditions, the presence of YcdB in the periplasm indicated that it could be translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane. As typically observed with recombinant Tat substrates, the translocation was relatively poor with wild-type levels of the Tat translocon. This is because the Tat system is slow and becomes rapidly saturated (20Yahr T.L. Wickner W.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2472-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). With YcdB, the high sensitivity of the signal sequence to degradation adds to these effects, as mature-size degradation products are formed in the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions containing the accumulating precursor. Together, the data at the wild-type Tat level showed a limited translocation of recombinant YcdB into the periplasm.To test whether translocation of YcdB depends on the presence of Tat system components, we tested the translocation in a TatABCDE-deficient derivative strain. Strikingly, there was not any transport of YcdB detectable without the Tat system (Fig. 1B). Thus, YcdB indeed requires the Tat system for translocation into the periplasm. Again, the precursor accumulated in the membrane and cytoplasmic fractions. An interesting aspect on which we did not focus in this study is that the detection of the precursor in the membrane fraction did not depend on the presence of the Tat system.To complete the evidence for the Tat dependence, we tested the complementation of YcdB translocation by tatABC, which was expressed in trans from its own promoter using the compatible low-copy vector pRK-tatABC (15Brüser T. Yano T. Brune D.C. Daldal F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We found that the translocation defect in the Tat-deficient strain was fully compensated by the tatABC genes in trans. The complementation system very much improved the translocation compared with the wild-type strain (Fig. 1B). Such a positive effect of the increased Tat system abundance on transport is typically observed with recombinant Tat substrates (20Yahr T.L. Wickner W.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2472-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A significant portion of YcdB accumulated in the cytoplasm, and a part of this was of mature size. Such a “mature” species could point to a natural cytoplasmic subpopulation of YcdB, or it simply could be the result of a translocon limitation: signal sequences of accumulating Tat substrates are often found to be sensitive to proteases, resulting in digestion of the signal sequence while the folded mature part of the protein remains intact. We addressed this aspect by lowering the ycdB induction (Fig. 1C). Strikingly, no precursor of YcdB accumulated at lowered induction, and the cytoplasmic processing decreased markedly relative to the amount of periplasmic YcdB. As cytoplasmic maturation is enhanced by a limited translocation at higher expression levels, it is unlikely to reflect some significant process under natural conditions. Together, our results indicate that YcdB is a novel Tat-dependently translocated periplasmic protein.We also addressed the possible Tat dependence of the translocation of YcdO. On the basis of signal sequence characteristics, YcdO has been postulated to be a Tat substrate (3Berks B.C. Palmer T. Sargent F. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, the twin-arginine motif in its signal sequence is not conserved in homologs from other phyla. In addition, there is a deviation from the consensus Tat signal pattern that is very unusual. The consensus twin-arginine pattern is (S/T)RRXFLK. In this pattern, the two arginines are almost invariable with the exception of a rarely occurring exchange of the first Arg with Lys (21Hinsley A.P. Stanley N.R. Palmer T. Berks B.C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 497: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic residues are commonly not found at the S/T position preceding the two arginines. YcdO has a hydrophobic Phe residue at that position, which raises additional doubts regarding the prediction that YcdO could be a Tat substrate.When we examined the subcellular localization of YcdO, we found that >50% of the detected recombinant YcdO was periplasmic. This rather high translocation efficiency was not Tat-dependent, as YcdO was equally well translocated in the absence of all Tat system components (Fig. 2). In SDS-PAGE analyses, periplasmic YcdO migrated at the same size as cytoplasmic YcdO. Again, as an internal marker on the same blot, the detected biotin carrier protein of the cytoplasmic fraction indicated that no cytoplasm had leaked into the periplasmic fraction. We examined whether the detected periplasmic YcdO was correctly processed. Recombinant YcdO was purified from the periplasmic fraction by affinity chromatography using a Strep-Tactin matrix and was subjected to electrospray mass spectrometry. We determined a molecular mass of 40,458 Da, which indicates a complete and homogeneous cleavage of the signal sequence behind position 26 (supplemental Fig. S1). The three residues preceding this cleavage site are ANA, which constitute a typical LepB cleavage site. Therefore, all periplasmically detected YcdO corresponded to translocated and correctly processed protein. Analytical ultracentrifugation indicated that YcdO is monomeric in solution (data not shown). Together, the data show that YcdO is a monomeric periplasmic protein that is not Tat-dependently translocated. These data led us to focus on YcdB, as only YcdB was Tat-dependently translocated.FIGURE 2YcdO is not a Tat substrate. Shown is the Tat independence of YcdO translocation. YcdO was detected in subcellular fractions from MC4100 (wild-type (wt)) and from its Tat-deficient derivative DADE (Δtat) by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.

The mass was found to be 45,127 Da, which exactly matches the mass of the mature protein when cleaved behind the typical LepB signal cleavage site (AHA) at a distance of 35 residues from the N terminus. A second mass of 43,814 Da corresponds to part of the purified mature protein with its C-terminal Strep-tag II degraded. There was no precursor detectable in the periplasmic fraction. When we analyzed the oligomeric state of YcdB by analytical ultracentrifugation, we determined an apparent mass of 89.9 ± 0.8 kDa, which indicates that periplasmic YcdB is a dimer (supplemental Fig. S3).The periplasmic YcdB preparation was slightly reddish, pointing to the presence of some chromogenic cofactor associated with YcdB. This cofactor could not be covalently bound, as the mentioned mass analysis did not show any alteration of the mass expected for the unmodified mature protein. In addition to the protein absorption at 277 nm, we identified a heme Soret band with a maximum at 406 nm and further weak features between 485 and 660 nm in UV-visible absorption spectra of periplasmic YcdB (Fig. 3A). The purified protein had an A406 nm/A277 nm ratio near 1.5. The extinction coefficient of the 406 nm band was calculated to be ∼65 mm–1 cm–1. Upon reduction with sodium dithionite, the 406 nm band slowly shifted within several minutes to 432 nm, and the weak features at longer wavelengths somewhat condensed and formed maxima at 558 and 622 nm. These data indicate that the heme in YcdB is purified in an oxidized state. Furthermore, the slow reduction of the heme iron by the strongly reducing dithionite suggests that transitions other than the FeIII/FeII transition might be physiological.FIGURE 3YcdB is a hemoprotein. A, overlay of UV-visible spectra of oxidized YcdB-Strep purified by affinity chromatography (ox) and the same sample 2 min after reduction with sodium dithionite (red).

We detected a signal at 616 Da, which was likely to correspond to an iron-containing protoporphyrin IX cofactor. Fragmentation analyses confirmed the identity of the heme cofactor (Fig. 3B). The fragments deduced from the 616 Da mass corresponded to two consecutive losses of 59 Da, which are indicative of cleavages in the heme propionate side chains (22Demirev P.A. Feldman A.B. Kongkasuriyachai D. Scholl P. Sullivan Jr., D. Kumar N. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 3262-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These data unequivocally demonstrate that YcdB contains an FeIII-protoporphyrin IX complex.The Heme Iron in YcdB Has a High-spin Electron Configuration—For functional aspects, it is important to determine the spin state of the heme iron in the hemoprotein. Cytochromes with electron transport function are usually low-spin, and the heme iron has six ligands in oxidized and reduced states. High-spin hemes have either five or six ligands in their oxidized state and always only five ligands in their reduced state (23Wood P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 293-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, hemoproteins that transiently bind substrates as axial ligands of the heme iron usually have a high-spin electron conformation. Among these high-spin hemoproteins are enzymes such as oxygenases, catalases, peroxidases, and ligand carriers.A clear classification of the spin state of hemoproteins can be made with spectra of reduced hemes with bound carbon monoxide (CO). The strong ligand field with CO causes a shift in the reduced high-spin heme iron to the low-spin electron configuration upon CO binding. The dithionite-reduced YcdB precursor was incubated with CO, and CO binding resulted in a sharp Soret band at 419 nm and further alterations in the region between 530 and 600 nm (Fig. 4A). The COred-minus-reduced difference spectrum clearly showed the COred α-maximum at 572 nm, the β-maximum at ∼536 nm, and the γ-maximum at 419 nm (Fig. 4B). The extinction difference between the peak at 419 nm and the trough at 437 nm was ∼30-fold higher than the corresponding difference for the α-band, indicating that the heme of YcdB is high-spin in the reduced state. The Soret maximum of >418 nm in the CO-bound state is in agreement with the noncovalent binding mode of the heme cofactor (23Wood P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 293-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Together, the spectroscopic data confirm that YcdB contains a noncovalent high-spin heme. YcdB is therefore likely to function as an enzyme with oxygenase or peroxidase activity.FIGURE 4Cofactor characterization of YcdB.

Peroxidases perform a FeIII/FeIV transition during their catalytic cycle when they produce the compound I intermediate, in which oxygen forms a double bond with FeIV (24Choe Y.K. Nagase S. J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1600-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To examine the possible peroxidase activity of YcdB, we used the quantitative guaiacol assay. In this assay, the H2O2-dependent oxidation of the colorless guaiacol results in a guaiacol tetramer, which can be monitored at 470 nm (ϵ470 nm = 26.6 mm–1 cm–1). Because YcdB is induced under acidic conditions (7Maurer L.M. Yohannes E. Bondurant S.S. Radmacher M. Slonczewski J.L. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 304-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), we measured the activity at different pH values in the acidic to neutral region. We found that YcdB had significant guaiacol peroxidase activity at pH 4.0 (Fig. 5, A and B). The activity was somewhat lower but still significant at pH 3.0. Under less acidic conditions (at pH 5.0 or pH 6.0), the activity was markedly reduced. From the data, we calculated an activity of ∼200 milliunits/mg purified YcdB with guaiacol as the H2O2-dependently oxidized substrate. As the natural substrate of YcdB is unknown, the specific peroxidase activity may be manyfold higher in vivo. Having established the peroxidase activity of YcdB, we wondered what influence hydrogen peroxide might have on the spectral characteristics of YcdB. Interestingly, H2O2 addition to oxidized YcdB caused major spectral alterations, indicating that H2O2 could generate a ligand to the ferric iron. The Soret band shifted to 414 nm, and three signals appeared at longer wavelengths of 530, 555, and 603 nm (Fig. 5C). Such spectral changes might reflect the formation of an intermediate similar to compound I in the known peroxidase cycle. Some preparations of YcdB already partially showed the characteristics of this adduct (data not shown), implying that YcdB undergoes this type of reaction also in vivo. Together, the data suggest that YcdB may have a functional role as a periplasmic peroxidase at low pH.FIGURE 5YcdB is a peroxidase with an activity maximum at acidic pH. A, kinetics of peroxidase activities with different amounts of YcdB-Strep (28, 42, and 56 μg) in 100 mm sodium citrate (pH 4.0). The H2O2-dependent formation of tetraguaiacol was followed at 470 nm. B, comparison of peroxidase activities in 100 mm sodium citrate/sodium phosphate buffer at pH 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0, with the activity at pH 4 set to 100%. C, addition of H2O2 results in the formation of an adduct at the oxidized heme with distinct spectroscopic characteristics. The UV-visible spectra of periplasmic YcdB in a pure adduct-free form (oxidized (ox)), after addition of 66 μm H2O2 (ox + H2O2), and after reduction by sodium dithionite (red) are shown. For clarity, the spectra of oxidized and reduced YcdB are shown in gray, and the H2O2-induced spectrum is shown in black. The positions of three H2O2-induced minor absorption bands are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)YcdB Can Assemble Heme in the Cytoplasm—It was important to determine whether YcdB can assemble its cofactor in the cytoplasm prior to translocation. We therefore purified YcdB also from the translocation-deficient DADE strain and recorded the UV-visible spectra from these preparations. Any heme in YcdB from this strain would indicate a cytoplasmic assembly. The spectra showed clearly that the heme cofactor was assembled (Fig. 6A). As a significant portion of YcdB in the cytoplasm had proteolytically lost its signal sequence (see Fig. 1B), we wanted to differentiate the cofactor content of the cytoplasmic precursor and mature YcdB. YcdB was purified from the cytoplasmic fraction of MC4100 carrying pBAD-ycdB-Strep, and the heme content of the cytoplasmic YcdB species was assessed by native gel electrophoresis and subsequent ac"

Many RXRα-regulated genes are themselves suppressed in inflamed liver via unknown mechanisms, which constitute a substantial component of the negative hepatic acute phase response. In this study we show that RXRα, generally considered a stable nuclear resident protein, undergoes rapid nuclear export in response to signals initiated by the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β), a central activator of the acute phase response. Within 30 min of exposure to IL-1β, nuclear levels of RXRα are markedly suppressed in human liver-derived HepG2 cells, temporally coinciding with its appearance in the cytoplasm. The nuclear residence of RXRα is maintained by inhibiting c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK, curcumin or SP600125) or CRM-1-mediated nuclear export (Leptomycin B). Pretreatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 blocks IL-1β-mediated reductions in nuclear RXRα levels while increasing accumulation in the cytoplasm. Mutational studies identify one residue, serine 260, a JNK phosphoacceptor site whose phosphorylation status had an unknown role in RXRα function, as critical for IL-1β-mediated nuclear export of transfected human RXRα-green fluorescent fusion constructs. These findings indicate that inflammation-mediated cell signaling leads to rapid and profound reductions in nuclear RXRα levels, via a multistep, JNK-dependent mechanism involving Ser260, nuclear export, and proteasomal degradation. Thus, inflammation-meditated cell signaling targets RXRα for nuclear export and degradation; a potential mechanism that explains the broad suppression of RXRα-dependent gene expression in the inflamed liver.

After injury or infection, the liver participates in a program of modified gene expression known collectively as the acute phase response (APR) 2The abbreviations used are: APR, acute phase response; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; RXR, retinoid X receptor; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CRM-1, chromosome region maintenance-1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DAPI, 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; LMB, leptomycin B; Sal, saline.2The abbreviations used are: APR, acute phase response; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; RXR, retinoid X receptor; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CRM-1, chromosome region maintenance-1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DAPI, 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; LMB, leptomycin B; Sal, saline.

A wide variety of hepatic functions are altered during the APR, much of which occurs by cytokine-mediated activation or suppression of target gene transcription. Among the principal hepatic physiologic processes inhibited during the negative hepatic APR are genes involved in endobiotic/xenobiotic metabolism, glucose homeostasis, and bile formation, which then leads to cholestasis. Activation of the negative hepatic APR leads to cholestasis by decreasing bile salt synthesis (2Feingold K.R. Spady D.K. Pollock A.S. Moser A.H. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 223-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), reducing canalicular bile salt export (3Hartmann G. Cheung A.K. Piquette-Miller M. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Recent evidence suggests that cytokine-mediated activation of cell signaling pathways during the APR leads to this coordinated response (6Moshage H. J. Pathol. 1997; 181: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). One possibility is targeted repression of the essential heterodimer partner for type II nuclear receptor, RXRα (NR2B1), which is an attractive mechanism to explain the suppression of many hepatic genes during the APR. Recent studies from multiple groups, including our own, support the involvement of inflammation-based cell signaling pathways as a suppressor of RXRα-dependent gene expression, although the underlying mechanisms are unknown (7Morgan E.T.

One cytokine in particular, interleukin-1β, (IL-1β) appears to be a major player in mediating these effects, both in vivo and in vitro (10Geier A. Dietrich C.G. Voigt S. Kim S.K. Gerloff T.

How IL-1β-activated pathways ultimately leads to reduced RXRα heterodimer DNA binding in the nucleus is not known.In this study we sought to investigate the hypothesis that IL-1β-mediated activation of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cell signaling reduces RXRα function by inducing its export from the nucleus and initiating proteasome-mediated degradation. We found that the subcellular localization of RXRα is responsive to IL-1β signaling, whereby it undergoes a rapid JNK-mediated, CRM-1-dependent nuclear export, leading to decreased nuclear RXRα levels and subsequent reduced nuclear DNA binding activity. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) technology, we show that JNK-mediated RXRα-GFP is exported out of the nucleus like native RXRα and that nuclear export involves the JNK phosphoacceptor site, serine 260. Finally, IL-1β-induced cell signaling leads to rapid proteasome-mediated degradation of RXRα, suggesting that JNK-mediated nuclear export is the first and critical step that results in reduced nuclear levels of RXRα. Taken together, these studies reveal that RXRα is a target for pro-inflammatory cytokine cell signaling and provide a novel molecular mechanism for the broad and significant reduction of hepatic RXRα-regulated gene expression in the inflamed liver.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—HepG2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). Cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen, human recombinant IL-1β was purchased from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN), Curcumin and SP600125 were from Calbiochem, MG132 was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), and Leptomycin B was from Sigma-Aldrich. FuGENE 6 was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Subcloning and mutation reagents were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Antibodies for JNK (number 9252) and Phospho-JNK (number 9251) were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA), antibodies detecting RXRα (sc-553), RARα (sc-551), and Oct1 (sc-232) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and the anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase was from Upstate Biotechnologies (Waltham, MA).Cell Culture—HepG2 cells, a human hepatoblastoma-derived cell line, were maintained in minimum essential medium containing Earle's salts and supplemented with 10% certified fetal bovine serum, penicillin-streptomycin, and l-glutamine. For protein analysis, cells were plated at 2.5 × 106 cells/10-cm dish and maintained in serum-containing medium for 48 h and then maintained in serum-free medium for 20 h prior to treatments. For transfections and immunofluorescent staining, HepG2 cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells onto glass coverslips.Cytokine and Inhibitor Treatments—After 20 h in serum-free medium, cells were treated with either 10 ng/ml IL-1β or vehicle control (0.0001% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) for 0–16 h. For inhibitor experiments cells were pretreated with 25 μm curcumin or vehicle (0.05% Me2SO), or 30 μm SP600125 or vehicle (0.3% Me2SO) for 30 min, or pretreated with 1 nm leptomycin B or vehicle (0.075% methanol) and then treated with 10 ng/ml IL-1β or vehicle for 30 min. For MG132 experiments, cells were pretreated for 1 h with 10 μm MG132 or vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) and then treated for 30 min with 10 ng/ml IL-1β or vehicle.Cell Fractionation and Immunoblotting—Total cell protein or nuclear and cytosolic cell fractions were extracted as previously reported by Itoh et al. (13Itoh M. Adachi M. Yasui H. Takekawa M. Tanaka H. Imai K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2382-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA Assay from Pierce. Ten μg of protein/well was electrophoresed in 12% acrylamide-ready gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, blots were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for either 1 h at room temperature or 20 h at 4 °C. Incubation in a 1:1000 dilution of anti-JNK and anti-phospho-JNK antibodies in 5% bovine serum albumin/TBS-T (Sigma) was carried out at 4 °C for 12–16 h. All other primary antibody incubations were done for 1 h at 25 °C at a 1:1000 dilution in the blocking buffer. After washing, membranes were incubated in 1:1000 goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody in the blocking buffer for 1 h at 25°C. Membranes were then washed and analyzed using Amersham Biosciences's Western Lightening Chemiluminescence kit and exposed to either Biomax film or the Kodak Imaging Station 2000R for detection.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts were prepared from treated HepG2 cell cultures according to published methods (12Li D.

Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). Double-stranded rat sodium-dependent taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide RXRα:RARα DR2 element (rat sodium-dependent taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide –53/–40) was end-labeled, purified, and incubated with 10 μg of HepG2 nuclear extracts for 30 min as described (12Li D.

After binding, each reaction was electrophoresed through a non-denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel, the gel was dried and exposed to BioMax film for varying time periods or developed with Cyclone Storage phosphor system screens and analyzed.Immunoflourescent Staining—HepG2 cells grown on coverslips were treated for 30 min with either saline vehicle or 10 ng/ml IL-1β and then washed with cold PBS. Cells were fixed for 20 min using 4% paraformaldehyde washed and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. After 30 min of blocking with 10% goat serum, cells were incubated for 1 h in a 1:50 dilution of anti-RXRα antibody to 1.5% goat serum/PBS. After three 5-min washes, cells were incubated with 1:500 goat anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Catalog number D1504, Santa Cruz) in 1.5% serum/PBS for 45 min. Cells were washed and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) mounting medium containing 1.5 μg/ml nuclear DNA stain DAPI and imaged using an Olympus microscope. Images were processed using softWorx software (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA).Plasmid Constructs—A C-terminal GFP-tagged RXRα construct, RXRα-GFPwt, was constructed by subcloning the human RXRα cDNA (nucleotides 69–1457, GenBank™ NM002957) into the EcoR1 and NotI sites of p3.1/CT-GFP (Invitrogen). Mutations of RXRα-GFP replacing serine 260 with alanine 260 (RXRαS260A-GFP) were made using the Stratagene QuikChange-XL kit and primers at base pairs nucleotides 836–875: sense mutation primer, 5′-CATGGGGCTGAACCCCGCCGCGCCGAACGACCCTG-3′ and antisense mutation primer, 5′-CAGGGTCGTTCGGCGCGGCGGGGTTCAGCCCCATG-3′. All sequences were verified by automated DNA sequencing (SeqWright, Houston, TX).Transient Transfections—Twenty-four hours after plating onto coverslips, HepG2 cells were transfected using a 2:3 μl of FuGENE 6:μgof plasmid DNA ratio/35-mm dish for 16 h. Cells on coverslips were placed in serum-free conditions for 20 h before treatment with either saline or IL-1β for 30 or 60 min, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at 25 °C. Coverslips were mounted on microscope slides using Vectashield.Microscopy and Deconvolution Analysis—Treated and fixed HepG2 cells were examined using an Olympus microscope and acquired images were deconvolved using softWorx software (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA). Intracellular location was quantified in a blinded fashion by counting 100 consecutive GFP-expressing cells/treatment group, and categorizing each cell as either exclusively nuclear (N), or both nuclear and cytoplasmic (N+C), expression. Experiments were performed a minimum of three times.Statistical Analyses—Data were expressed as the means ± S.D. from at least three independent experiments. Differences between experimental groups were evaluated for statistical significance using Student's t test where p < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.RESULTSIL-1β Induces a Rapid Shift in RXRα Subcellular Location—We first sought to determine the effects of IL-1β on RXRα protein levels and localization in the human liver-derived cell line, HepG2, a well studied model of IL-1β modulation of RXRα-regulated hepatic gene expression (9Denson L.A. Auld K.L. Schiek D.S. McClure M.H. Mangelsdorf D.J. Karpen S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8835-8843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 12Li D. Zimmerman T.L.

Within 30 min of exposure to IL-1β, nuclear levels of RXRα fall significantly (Fig. 1, A and B) and return to baseline levels within 16 h after treatment. Correspondingly, within 30 min, RXRα protein is readily detectable in cytoplasmic fractions from IL-1β-treated cells. Importantly, nuclear and cytoplasmic levels of two transcription factors, the heterodimer partner of RXRα, RARα, and the non-nuclear receptor transcription factor Oct1, were not significantly affected by IL-1β treatment, (Fig. 1, A and B), demonstrating that the effects of IL-1β on RXRα protein subcellular localization are specific. Notably, slower migrating RXRα species were present in the nuclear fractions obtained 30–60 min after cytokine treatment (Fig. 1A, *), consistent with rapid post-translational modification. Immunohistochemical detection of native RXRα protein in HepG2 cells mirrors the response to IL-1β seen in immunoblot analyses (Fig. 1, compare A with C–H). The typical native nuclear residence of RXRα is unchanged by saline (Fig. 1, C, E, and G), whereas IL-1β treatment for 30 min clearly leads to a predominant cytoplasmic localization of RXRα (Fig. 1, D, F, and H). Thus, as evident from both immunoblot and immunocytochemical analyses, IL-1β treatment leads to a rapid and profound reduction in nuclear RXRα, coincident with a relocalization of RXRα from the nucleus to cytoplasm.Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Fig. 1I) performed on nuclear extracts from IL-1β-treated HepG2 cells show decreased binding of nuclear proteins to a typical RXRα heterodimer binding site (DR2), with a timeline that corresponds to the rapid and sustained depletion of nuclear RXRα (Fig. 1, compare I with B). Because activation of JNK is involved in IL-1β-mediated suppression of RXRα:RARα activation of the sodium-dependent taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide DR2 element, it was important to determine whether there is a temporal link between JNK activation and subcellular relocalization of RXRα (12Li D.

As seen in Fig. 1J, the timeline of IL-1β-JNK activation (as phospho-JNK) is not only consistent with previous reports (15Poulos J.E. Weber J.D. Bellezzo J.M. Di Bisceglie A.M. Britton R.S. Bacon B.R. Baldassare J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G804-G811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but coincides with the peak subcellular relocalization of RXRα (Fig. 1J).IL-1β-mediated RXRα Nucleocytoplasmic Relocalization Is Critically Dependent upon JNK—JNK can phosphorylate RXRα at several sites, yet the physiological consequences are controversial (16Rochette-Egly C. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Nor is there a known role for IL-1β-mediated effects on RXRα nucleocytoplasmic relocalization, although results in Fig. 1 support this possibility (14Adam-Stitah S. Penna L. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18932-18941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of JNK in IL-1β modulation of RXRα subcellular localization, we utilized two potent inhibitors of JNK activity, curcumin, the yellow pigment derived from the spice turmeric (12Li D.

Investig. 2001; 108: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). As seen in Figs. 2, A–D, pretreatment with either agent potently inhibits the effects of IL-1β on the subcellular localization of RXRα. These findings clearly support a critical role for IL-1β-activated JNK in determining the subcellular localization of RXRα.FIGURE 2JNK inhibitors block the appearance of cytoplasmic RXRα after exposure to IL-1β.

Given the rapid timeline and the limited evidence for significant residence of RXRα in the cytoplasm (see Fig. 1C (19Prufer K. Barsony J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1738-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 20Rastinejad F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar)) we considered the former possibility to be less likely than the latter. HepG2 cells were pretreated with either vehicle or leptomycin B (LMB), a potent inhibitor of CRM-1 (chromosome region maintenance-1)-dependent nuclear export, prior to IL-1β treatments (21Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). In extracts from IL-1β-treated cells, nuclear RXRα levels were modestly, but insignificantly, reduced when pretreated with LMB (Fig. 3), whereas cytoplasmic RXRα levels remained essentially undetectable. Inhibition of newly translated RXRα import into the nucleus was unlikely to be a major component of the actions of IL-1β, because pretreatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide had no discernible effect on either nuclear or cytoplasmic RXRα levels in response to IL-1β (data not shown). Taken together, these finding indicate that the rapid reduction in nuclear RXRα, accompanied by its appearance in the cytoplasm in response to IL-β-induced signaling, is because of nuclear export of resident nuclear RXRα protein and not via an impairment in nuclear import of newly synthesized RXRα.FIGURE 3Leptomycin B blocks IL-1β-induced nuclear export of RXRα.

The RXRα-GFP fusion protein construct transactivated a reporter gene to a similar extent as transfected RXRα, indicating that the GFP tag had no significant effect on the transcriptional activity of RXRα (data not shown). HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with RXRα-GFP and analyzed in a blinded fashion by categorizing the subcellular location of GFP in individual transfected GFP-positive cells as either exclusively nuclear (N), or both nuclear and cytoplasmic (N+C). Between 68 and 73% of transfected cells express the RXRα-GFP protein exclusively in the nuclear compartment (vehicle treatments, Fig. 4 and 5), whereas the remaining 27–32% of transfected cells showed RXRα-GFP expression throughout the cell (N+C). When treated with IL-1β for 60 min, only 25–30% of transfected cells exhibited exclusive nuclear RXRα-GFP localization (≈70% reduction, Figs. 4 and 5), similar to the response of endogenous RXRα protein to IL-1β seen in immunoblot and immunocytochemical analyses (Fig. 1).FIGURE 4Curcumin and leptomycin B block IL-1β-induced nuclear export of RXRα-GFP. A, HepG2 cells were plated onto coverslips and transfected with RXRα-GFP then pretreated with Me2SO vehicle or 25 mm curcumin for 30 min followed by a 60 min treatment with saline or 10 ng/ml IL-1β. Cells were formalin-fixed, followed by blinded counts of 100 consecutive GFP-positive cells, scored as either nuclear (N, more than 90% of GFP protein was exclusively nuclear) or a mixed pattern of nuclear and cytosolic (N+C) (n = 3). B, HepG2 cells were transfected with RXRα-GFP and pretreated with either methanol vehicle (MetOH) or 1 nm leptomycin B for 1 h followed by 60 min of saline or 10 ng/ml IL-1β exposure.

A–L, HepG2 cells were plated on coverslips and transfected with either a plasmid encoding the wild type RXRα cDNA with an C-terminal GFP tag (RXRα-GFP, A–F) or with a mutation that substitutes an alanine for serine 260 (RXRαS260A-GFP, G–L). Cells were treated with either saline vehicle (A–C, G–I) or 10 ng/ml IL-1β (D–F, J–L) for 60 min followed by formalin fixation and detection as noted under “Experimental Procedures.” M, quantitation of transfected GFP-positive cells, as noted in the legend to Fig. 4 (n = 3). Bar graphs depict mean ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Response of RXRα-GFP to IL-1β Is Curcumin- and LMB-sensitive—To test the role of JNK phosphorylation and CRM-1-dependent nuclear export, we followed the response of RXRα-GFP to IL-1β after a short pretreatment period with either curcumin or LMB. A 30-min pretreatment with the JNK inhibitor curcumin completely blocked the export of RXRα in response to IL-1β treatment (Fig. 4A), similar to that seen for native RXRα (Fig. 2, A and B). One hour of LMB pretreatment blocked the ability of IL-1β to cause a decrease in nuclear levels of RXRα-GFP (Fig. 4B). In concert with the immunoblot analyses (Figs. 2 and 3), these findings support critical and integral roles for JNK and CRM-1 in IL-1β-induced nuclear export of both native and GFP-tagged, RXRα, and that C-terminally tagged RXRα-GFP faithfully models the response of native RXRα to IL-1β.Ser260 Is Critically Involved in RXRα-GFP Nuclear Export—Several amino acid residues in RXRα, including Ser260, have been identified as JNK phosphorylation sites (14Adam-Stitah S. Penna L. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18932-18941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), although the functional consequences related to the phosphorylation status of these sites are uncertain (22Matsushima-Nishiwaki R. Okuno M. Adachi S. Sano T. Akita K. Moriwaki H. Friedman S.L. Kojima S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7675-7682PubMed Google Scholar). An analysis of the potential JNK sites in RXRα led us to first explore a role for Ser260 in IL-1β-mediated nuclear export by creating RXRαS260A-GFP, where Ala is substituted for Ser260. Upon IL-1β treatment, nuclear export of RXRαS260A-GFP was significantly attenuated in comparison to wild type RXRα-GFP (Fig. 5, G–L compared with A–F). After IL-1β treatment, 52% of cells transfected with RXRαS260A-GFP still retained exclusive nuclear residence (Fig. 5M), significantly higher than 25% of cells transfected with wild type RXRα-GFP (Fig. 5M). Transfected cells expressing either RXRα-GFP or RXRαS260A-GFP showed no significant difference in the predominantly nuclear localization of the fusion protein (73 and 71%, respectively; see Fig. 5, A, G, and M), nor in trans-activating"

Previously we isolated an anti-DNA monoclonal Ab 3D8 from an autoimmune-prone MRL-lpr/lpr mouse. Here we have characterized DNA binding kinetics and hydrolyzing activities of the recombinant single chain variable fragment (scFv) and the single variable domains of heavy chain (VH) and light chain (VL) using various single-stranded (ss) and double-stranded (ds) DNA substrates. All the Abs bound to both ds- and ssDNAs without significant preferential sequence specificity showing scFv higher affinities (KD = ∼17–74 nm) than VH (KD = ∼2.4–8.4 μm) and VL (KD = ∼3.2–72 μm), and efficiently hydrolyzed both ds- and ssDNAs without sequence specificity in a Mg2+-dependent manner, except for the poor activity of 3D8 scFv for ss-(dT)40. Elucidated crystal structure-based His to Ala mutations on the complementarity determining regions of VH (His-H35 → Ala) and/or VL (His-L94 → Ala) of 3D8 scFv significantly inhibited the catalytic activities, indicating that the His residues are involved in the catalytic mechanism of 3D8 scFv. However, the DNA hydrolyzing activities of single domain VH and VL were not affected by the mutations, indicative of their different catalytic mechanisms from that of 3D8 scFv.

Science. 1992; 256: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) reported that some autoantibodies derived from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus possessed DNA nicking activities, some anti-DNA Abs from many autoimmune and viral diseases have also shown DNA and/or RNA hydrolyzing catalytic activities (15Nevinsky G.A.

The origin of DNA-hydrolyzing catalytic Abs, so called “DNA-abzymes,” mainly belonging to immunoglobulin M (IgM) or G (IgG) class, have been proposed to be anti-idiotypic Abs to active sites of nucleases, Abs produced against DNA or nucleoprotein complexes, and/or Abs existing in germ line cells even before somatic mutations (15Nevinsky G.A.

A number of polyclonal DNA-abzymes have been described, but the detailed biochemical and structural basis of catalytic mechanisms of monoclonal Abs (mAbs) have not been extensively characterized (1Marion T.N.

An exception is BV04-01, which binds to and hydrolyzes both ss- and dsDNA with preferential cleavages for T-rich ssDNA and CG-rich dsDNA (8Gololobov G.V. Rumbley C.A. Rumbley J.N. Schourov D.V.

In addition to intact IgG, IgM, and IgA Abs, their fragments of Fab, scFv, and/or light chains have been attributed to DNase activities (15Nevinsky G.A. Buneva V.N. J. Immunol.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, no studies have been reported for single variable domain Abs of heavy chain (VH) and light chain (VL) with DNase activities. Previously we have isolated an anti-DNA mAb 3D8 from the spleen cells of the MRL-lpr/lpr mouse, which spontaneously develops an autoimmune syndrome that resembles human systemic lupus erythematosus (21Kwon M.H. Lee M.S. Kim K.H. Park S. Shin H.J. Jang Y.J. Kim H.I. Immunol. Investig. 2002; 31: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the present study, we aim to characterize DNA binding kinetics and hydrolyzing activities of 3D8 scFv, VH, and VL proteins in detail using supercoiled plasmids and various synthetic ss- and ds-oligodeoxynucleotides as substrates. We found that 3D8 scFv, VH, and VL bound to and hydrolyzed both ss- and dsDNAs in the presence of Mg2+ without significant sequence specificities. Furthermore, we determined the crystal structure of 3D8 scFv and performed site-directed mutagenesis studies based on the structural information to gain some insights into catalytic mechanism(s) of the proteins. Materials—Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and high fidelity DNA polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs. All other chemicals and solvents used were of analytical grade. The following 40-bp oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized from Genotech (Seoul, Korea) in unlabeled and labeled (5′-digoxigenin and/or 3′-biotin) forms: ss-(dT)40, ss-(dA)40, ss-(dG-dC)20, ss-(dC-dG)20, ss-(dN)40 (n = 5′-CCATGAGTGATAACACTGCGGCCAACTTACTTCTGACAAC-3′) and ss-(dN′)40 (N′= the reverse complementary sequence of N). dsDNAs were generated by annealing equimolar amounts of the labeled and its unlabeled reverse complementary ssDNAs in water at 65 °C for 5 min, cooling to 20 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min, and then chilling on ice (22Mouratou B. Rouyre S. Guesdon J.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 269: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The preparation of dsDNAs was confirmed by hypochromicity at 260 nm (22Mouratou B. Rouyre S. Guesdon J.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 269: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructions—The 3D8 scFv gene was derived from the hybridoma cell line producing mAb 3D8 IgG, originating from an autoimmune-prone MRL-lpr/lpr mouse (21Kwon M.H. Lee M.S. Kim K.H. Park S. Shin H.J. Jang Y.J. Kim H.I. Immunol. Investig. 2002; 31: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The VH (NCBI accession number AAF79128) and VL (NCBI accession number AAF79129) genes were cloned into the pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega Corp.), then subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pIg20 (23Brigido M.M. Polymenis M. Stollar B.D. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 469-479PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in pIg20-3D8 scFv. This vector encodes a (G4S)3 flexible linker between the VH and VL sequences (VH-(G4S)3-VL), a thrombin cleavage site followed by the Staphylococcal protein A (SPA) tag at the C terminus, and a N-terminal bacterial alkaline phosphatase signal peptide for targeting protein expression to the periplasm under control of the T7 promoter. Each gene of the VH and VL single domains was also subcloned into the pIg20, generating pIg20-VH and pIg20-VL, respectively. The constructs were confirmed by sequencing and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysE cells (Novagen). Bacterial Expression and Purification of the Proteins—The transformed cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.8 in 1-liter of Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and then induced for 16 h at 30 °C by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The induced cells were harvested and the fusion proteins of 3D8 scFv-SPA, VH-SPA, and VL-SPA were purified from the culture supernatant with an IgG-Sepharose™ affinity column (Amersham Biosciences), as described (21Kwon M.H.

Immunol. 1993; 150: 469-479PubMed Google Scholar). The SPA tag was removed from the fusion proteins by thrombin cleavage and then the cleaved proteins of scFv, VH, and VL were further purified using the IgG-Sepharose™ column as described (21Kwon M.H. Lee M.S. Kim K.H. Park S. Shin H.J. Jang Y.J. Kim H.I. Immunol. Investig. 2002; 31: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 24Chen Y. Stollar B.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4663-4670PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were >99% pure as judged by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Protein concentrations were determined using extinction coefficients of 1.995 for scFv, 2.325 for VH, and 1.674 for VL in units of mg ml–1 cm–1 at 280 nm, which were calculated from the respective amino acid sequence. Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) Analyses of Proteins—SEC analyses for the purified 3D8 scFv, VH, VL, and Fv (non-covalently associated form of VH and VL) were performed on a Agilent 1100 high performance liquid chromatography system using a TSK G3000SWXL size exclusion column (7.8 × 300 mm, TosoHaas, Japan), with a mobile phase of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, plus 150 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. Chromatograms were obtained by monitoring absorbance at 280 nm. The injection amount ranged between 5 and 20 μm of proteins in a volume of 20 μl. A set of molecular mass standard markers (Sigma) ranging from 13.7 to 66 kDa was used. DNA Binding Assay by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—Ninety six-well polystyrene microtiter plates (Nunc, Invitrogen Ltd.) were coated with 100 μl of oligodeoxynucleotide substrates at 10 μg/ml in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl (“TBS”) for 1 h at 37 °C, and washed (3 times) with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (“TBST”), then blocked with TBS containing 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C (5Eivazova E.R. McDonnell J.M. Sutton B.J. Staines N.A. Immunology. 2000; 101: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 22Mouratou B. Rouyre S. Guesdon J.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 269: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Then, proteins (100 μl of 20 μg/ml) were added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing the wells with TBST, the wells were incubated with rabbit IgG (100 μl of 1 μg/ml) (Pierce Biotechnology) and then with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (100 μl of 1:10,000 dilution) (Pierce). Each incubation step was performed for 1 h at 25 °C, followed by washing (3 times) with TBST. Finally, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) solution (1 mg/ml in 0.1 m glycine, 1 mm ZnCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 10.3) was added to each well and absorbance was read at 405 nm in a microplate reader. To investigate effects of ionic strength on the binding activities of proteins, proteins were incubated on the substrate-coated wells in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing various concentrations of NaCl (0–0.8 m) for 1 h at 37 °C. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Assays—Kinetic measurements of protein-protein interactions were performed at 25 °C using a Biacore 2000 SPR biosensor (Amersham Biosciences). The measured SPR values are expressed in arbitrary response units. For measurements of protein-protein interactions, ∼0.5–1.0 mg/ml of proteins in a coupling buffer (10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0) were immobilized onto the carboxymethylated dextran surface of a CM5 sensor chip at a level of 800–1000 response units by an amine coupling method according to the manufacturer's instructions (25Lee H.W. Lee S.H. Lee H.W. Ryu Y.W. Kwon M.H. Kim Y.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 330: 1205-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A reference surface was generated simultaneously under the same conditions, and BSA (100 μm) was injected as a control to correct for instrument and buffer artifacts. Each protein prepared in concentrations from 5 nm to 20 μm by serial dilutions with PBS buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, plus 100 mm NaCl) was injected into the flow cells (association phase), which was followed by PBS buffer (dissociation phase), both at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. The sensor surface was regenerated between assays by injecting 30 μl of a wash buffer containing 50 mm NaOH and 25 mm NaCl, to remove bound proteins (25Lee H.W. Lee S.H. Lee H.W. Ryu Y.W. Kwon M.H. Kim Y.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 330: 1205-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For measurements of protein-DNA interactions, the following 3′-biotin-labeled ss- and dsDNAs were used as substrates: ss-(dT)40, ds-(dT: dA)40, ss-(dG-dC)20, ds-(dG-dC:dC-dG)20, ss-(dN)40, and ds-(dN: dN′)40. To immobilize the substrates to the streptavidin-coated sensor chip SA (Amersham Biosciences) (5Eivazova E.R. McDonnell J.M. Sutton B.J. Staines N.A. Immunology. 2000; 101: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 13Polymenis M. Stollar B.D. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2198-2208PubMed Google Scholar), 0.1 μm substrate in HES buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20) was injected at a rate of 5 μl/min over each flow cell, resulting in immobilized levels of 700–1000 response units. 3D8 scFv (5–200 nm), VH (0.2–50 μm), and VL (1.6–200 μm) prepared by serial dilutions with HES were injected over the flow cells at 50 μl/min for 3 min, followed by a constant flow of HES buffer at 50 μl/min for 3 min to observe dissociation of bound proteins. BSA (100 μm) and monoclonal anti-c-Myc 9e10 antibody (100 μm) (Sigma) were used as negative controls. At the end of each cycle, bound proteins were removed by injection of 50 mm NaOH containing 1 m NaCl for 60 s each to regenerate the chip. Comparison between sensorgrams was carried out by subtracting the responses in the control flow cell. All kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear regression analysis according to a 1:1 binding model using the BIAevaluation version 3.2 software provided by manufacturer (25Lee H.W. Lee S.H.

The dissociation constant KD was calculated using the formula KD = koff/kon, where koff and kon are the dissociation and association rate constants, respectively. DNA Hydrolyzing Assay by Agarose Gel Electrophoresis—The supercoiled plasmids of M13mp18 and pUC19 used as substrates were purified by a plasmid miniprep kit (Intron Inc., Korea). More than 95% of the isolated plasmid DNAs existed as the supercoiled form, judged by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA hydrolyzing experiments were initiated by mixing proteins (scFv (0.06–0.8 μm), Fv (5 μm), VH (5 μm), and VL (5 μm)) with the substrates (2.2 nm) in TBS containing 2 mm MgCl2. If necessary, 2 mm MgCl2 was replaced with 2–10 mm CaCl2, 2–10 mm MnCl2, or 50 mm EDTA in the buffer, which was specified “Results.” In all cases, the total ionic strength was maintained at 150 mm by adjusting NaCl concentrations in the TBS buffer. After reactions were performed at 37 °C for 1 or 12 h and then terminated by incubating with trypsin protease (20 μg/ml) (Sigma) for 1 h at 37°C, samples were analyzed on 0.8% agarose gels by electrophoresis. The agarose gels were stained with ethidium bromide. DNA Hydrolyzing Assay by Affinity-linked Oligonucleotide Nuclease Assay (ALONA)—ALONA was performed by following the protocol of Mouratou et al. (22Mouratou B. Rouyre S. Guesdon J.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 269: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As substrates, 5′-digoxigenin and 3′-biotin-labeled oligodeoxynucleotides, ss-(dT)40, ds-(dT:dA)40, ss-(dN)40, ds-(dN:dN′)40, ss-(dG-dC)20, and ds-(dG-dC:dC-dG)20, were used. Briefly, after immobilizing the labeled substrates to the streptavidin-coated microplate and subsequent washing (3 times) with TBST, each protein of 3D8 scFv (0.8 μm), Fv (5 μm), VH (5 μm), and VL (5 μm) was incubated for 10 h at 37 °C in TBS containing either 2 mm MgCl2 or 50 mm EDTA. After washing (3 times) with TBS, uncleaved labeled substrates were detected using anti-digoxigenin Fab conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Hoffman-Roche Inc.) followed by incubation with p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate and subsequent reading absorbance at 405 nm (22Mouratou B. Rouyre S. Guesdon J.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 269: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As positive controls, bovine pancreatic DNase I (New England Biolabs) and S1 nuclease (New England Biolabs) were used in the buffers provided by the manufacturer. Protein Crystallization and Structure Determination—The purified 3D8 scFv protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml in TBS buffer. Initial screening for crystallization with a sparse matrix sampling method (26Jancarik J. Kim S.-H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2078) Google Scholar) was performed at 18 °C using a hanging drop vapor-diffusion method by mixing 1 μl of the protein with an equal volume of reservoir solution. Hexagonal-shaped crystals were obtained within 3 days in 2 m lithium sulfate and 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.0, with a maximum dimension of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.5 mm3. Crystals belonged to space group P6122 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 179.74 Ä, c = 184.28 Ä, α = β = 90.0°, γ = 120.0°, and the asymmetric unit might contain six to two molecules with 40% to more than 80% of solvent content. Before cryocooling, crystals were briefly immersed in the reservoir solution containing 5–10% 2,4-methylpentanediol as a cryoprotectant. Diffraction data were collected at –173 °C at the HFMX4A at the Pohang Light Source (PLS at POSTECH, Korea), processed, merged, and scaled using the HKL2000 package (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The phasing problem was solved by the molecular replacement program Phaser-1.3 (28McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar) using the Phage Library-derived scFv Fragment (Protein Data Bank code 1DZB) (29Ay J. Keitel T. Kuttner G. Wessner H. Scholz C. Hahn M. Hohne W. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The model was built using the program O (30Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar) and refined with the CNS package (31Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized corresponding to the region covering two His residues (His-35 on VH and His-94 on VL in Kabat numbering). Site-specific mutants were generated by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. Expression and Purification of the Recombinant Proteins—Each gene of 3D8 scFv, VH, and VL subcloned into pIg20 vector was expressed well (usually >0.5–1 mg from l-liter cultures) and purified from bacterial culture supernatants, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” When analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE, the proteins of 3D8 scFv, VH, and VL were migrated as single bands at the expected positions corresponding to each calculated molecular mass, i.e. 28 kDa for scFv, 15 kDa for VH, and 14 kDa for VL (Fig. 1). Protein-Protein Interactions—To determine the size distribution of proteins under non-denaturing conditions, the proteins of scFv, VH, and VL were analyzed by SEC. SEC elution profile of each protein showed single peaks that correspond to an apparent molecular mass of each protein, demonstrating that the proteins were monomeric in solution at micromolar concentrations (Fig. 2A). When VH and VL (each 5 μm) were mixed at the equimolar ratio, they migrated as a single peak corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of ∼26 kDa, which is close to the sum of molecular mass of VH and VL (Fig. 2A). This demonstrated that VH and VL spontaneously assembled to form Fv (VH: VL) in solution by noncovalent interactions. The association affinity between VH and VL was quantified by SPR techniques at 25 °C (Fig. 2B). When the VH domain was flowed over a VL-immobilized surface chip, the apparent dissociation constant (KD) was 24 ± 4 nm with an association rate constant (kon) of 2.60 ± 0.11 × 105 m–1 s–1 and a dissociation rate constant (koff) of 6.19 ± 0.09 × 10–3 s–1. In a reciprocal experiment, where the VL domain was injected into a VH-immobilized surface chip, the KD was 14 ± 2nm with kon = 4.35 ± 0.27 × 105 m–1 s–1 and koff = 6.16 ± 0.50 × 10–3 s–1. No homomeric interactions of 3D8 scFv, VH, and VL were detected up to 50 μm concentration by SPR (data not shown), which was in good agreement with the SEC data. DNA Binding Activities—Our previous ELISA result has shown that 3D8 IgG has a DNA binding activity to ds-poly(dT:dA) and ds-poly(dG: dC) (21Kwon M.H. Lee M.S. Kim K.H. Park S. Shin H.J. Jang Y.J. Kim H.I. Immunol. Investig. 2002; 31: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have employed SPR techniques to quantify the interactions of 3D8 scFv, VH, and VL with the various synthetic 40-bp oligodeoxynucleotides, including ss-(dT)40, ds-(dT: dA)40, ss-(dN)40, ds-(dN:dN′)40, ss-(dG-dC)20, and ds-(dG-dC:dC-dG)20 (Table 1). 3D8 scFv, VH, and VL efficiently bound to all kinds of the substrates in a concentration-dependent manner, regardless of ss- and dsDNA forms and their specific sequences (Table 1). For 3D8 scFv, the kinetic binding parameters of kon and koff values ranged ∼5.27–15.5 × 104 m–1 s–1 and ∼1.98–4.85 × 10–3 s–1, respectively, resulting in KD values of ∼17–74 nm (Table 1), which were within the ranges of those observed for other anti-DNA IgG, Fab, and scFv Abs (3O'Connor K.C.

The binding affinity of 3D8 scFv against the ds form of each sequence was slightly higher than that for the corresponding ss form, mainly because of the slightly faster association kinetics (Table 1). Compared with 3D8 scFv, 3D8 VH bound less tightly with ∼100-fold lower affinities for both ds- and ssDNA substrates. Contrary to 3D8 scFv, however, 3D8 VH exhibited slightly higher affinities with ssDNA forms (KD = ∼2.4–7.5 μm) of each sequence than the corresponding dsDNA forms (KD = ∼4.7–8.4 μm), mainly because of faster association kinetics (Table 1). The affinity of 3D8 VL (KD =∼3.2–72 μm) for the substrates was ∼103- and 10-fold lower than those of 3D8 scFv and VH, respectively. Unlikely with 3D8 scFv and VH, 3D8 VL exhibited a preferential binding for ds-(dT:dA)40 (KD =∼3.2 μm) over the other substrates. For negative controls, BSA (100 μm) and anti-c-Myc 9e10 mAb (100 μm) gave no responses when passed over the DNA-immobilized surfaces (data not shown).TABLE 1Kinetic binding parameters for"
https://openalex.org/W1983338961,"d-Apiose serves as the binding site for borate cross-linking of rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) in the plant cell wall, and biosynthesis of d-apiose involves UDP-d-apiose/UDP-d-xylose synthase catalyzing the conversion of UDP-d-glucuronate to a mixture of UDP-d-apiose and UDP-d-xylose. In this study we have analyzed the cellular effects of depletion of UDP-d-apiose/UDP-d-xylose synthases in plants by using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of NbAXS1 in Nicotiana benthamiana. The recombinant NbAXS1 protein exhibited UDP-d-apiose/UDP-d-xylose synthase activity in vitro. The NbAXS1 gene was expressed in all major plant organs, and an NbAXS1-green fluorescent protein fusion protein was mostly localized in the cytosol. VIGS of NbAXS1 resulted in growth arrest and leaf yellowing. Microscopic studies of the leaf cells of the NbAXS1 VIGS lines revealed cell death symptoms including cell lysis and disintegration of cellular organelles and compartments. The cell death was accompanied by excessive formation of reactive oxygen species and by induction of various protease genes. Furthermore, abnormal wall structure of the affected cells was evident including excessive cell wall thickening and wall gaps. The mutant cell walls contained significantly reduced levels of d-apiose as well as 2-O-methyl-l-fucose and 2-O-methyl-d-xylose, which serve as markers for the RG-II side chains B and A, respectively. These results suggest that VIGS of NbAXS1 caused a severe deficiency in the major side chains of RG-II and that the growth defect and cell death was likely caused by structural alterations in RG-II due to a d-apiose deficiency. d-Apiose serves as the binding site for borate cross-linking of rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) in the plant cell wall, and biosynthesis of d-apiose involves UDP-d-apiose/UDP-d-xylose synthase catalyzing the conversion of UDP-d-glucuronate to a mixture of UDP-d-apiose and UDP-d-xylose.

The primary wall of higher plants consists of a rigid cellulose-xyloglucan network that is embedded in and interacts with a pectin network. Rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) 4The abbreviations used are: RG-II, rhamnogalacturonan II; RT, reverse transcription; kb, kilobase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; VIGS, virus-induced gene silencing; TRV, tobacco rattle virus; H2DCFDA, 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; ROS, reactive oxygen species; HR, hypersensitive response. 4The abbreviations used are: RG-II, rhamnogalacturonan II; RT, reverse transcription; kb, kilobase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; VIGS, virus-induced gene silencing; TRV, tobacco rattle virus; H2DCFDA, 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; ROS, reactive oxygen species; HR, hypersensitive response. is a structurally complex pectic polysaccharide found in primary walls of angiosperms and gymnosperms. RG-II is composed of at least 12 different glycosyl residues linked together by more than 20 different glycosidic linkages, but despite this complexity, the glycosyl-residue composition of RG-II is remarkably conserved among species (1Pérez S. Rodríguez-Carvajal M.A. Doco T. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 2O'Neill M.A. Ishii T. Albersheim P. Darvill A.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2004; 55: 109-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). RG-II exists predominantly as a dimer that is covalently cross-linked by a borate diester. Borate cross-linking of RG-II additionally results in cross-linking of the two homogalacturonan chains upon which the RG-II molecules are constructed (2O'Neill M.A. Ishii T. Albersheim P. Darvill A.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2004; 55: 109-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). These processes of cross-linking are thought to result in a stable three-dimensional pectin network. Although little is known about how the structural complexity of RG-II contributes to its biological function, evidence suggests that the structural integrity of the RG-II molecule is essential for normal borate cross-link formation. The mur1 mutant is dwarfed and has brittle stems (3Reiter W.-D. Chapple C.C.S. Somerville C.R. Science. 1993; 261: 1032-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and these defects are caused by a mutation in GMD2 encoding a GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase, an enzyme required for the biosynthesis of l-fucose (4Bonin C.P. Potter I. Vanzin G.F. Reiter W.-D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2085-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). RG-II synthesized by the mur1 mutant completely lacks l-Fuc residues, and only ∼50% of the RG-II is cross-linked by borate (5O'Neill M.A. Eberhard S. Albersheim P. Darvill A.G. Science. 2001; 294: 846-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the mur2 mutant, which is defective in a xyloglucan-specific fucosyltransferase, synthesizes xyloglucan that contains little l-Fuc but grows normally (6Vanzin G.F. Madson M. Carpita N.C. Raikhel N.V. Keegstra K. Reiter W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3340-3345Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), indicating that xyloglucan fucosylation is not critical for plant growth regulation and wall strength. Taken together, these results suggest that the dwarfed phenotype of mur1 plants is caused by reduced cross-linking of RG-II due to lack of l-fucose residues. Supporting this, an exogenous supply of borate rescues the growth defect of the mur1 mutant (5O'Neill M.A. Eberhard S. Albersheim P. Darvill A.G. Science. 2001; 294: 846-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The nolac-H18 tobacco callus mutant shows reduced cell adhesion and defective shoot development, which is caused by altered RG-II structure (7Iwai H. Masaoka N. Ishii T. Satoh S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16319-16324Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The RG-II of the mutant lacks the α-l-Galp-(1 → 2)-β-d-GlcpA-(1 → portion of side chain A. Only ∼50% of the RG-II in the mutant walls is present as a dimer compared with >95% dimer formation in wild-type walls. Expression of NpGUT1 encoding a putative glucuronosyltransferase in the mutant rescues the mutant phenotype, including restoration of borate cross-linking to normal levels (7Iwai H. Masaoka N. Ishii T. Satoh S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16319-16324Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the α-l-Galp-(1 → 2)-β-d-GlcpA-(1 → portion of side chain A is required for normal borate cross-linking. Finally, the bor1 mutant has a defective efflux type transporter that mediates borate transfer (8Takano J. Noguchi K. Yasumori M. Kobayashi M. Gajdos Z. Miwa K. Hayashi H. Yoneyama T. Fujiwara T. Nature. 2002; 420: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The wild-type and bor1 RG-II have similar glycosyl residue compositions, but ∼60% of RG-II in bor1 cell walls is present as the monomer (9Noguchi K. Ishii T. Matsunaga T. Kakegawa K. Hayashi H. Fujiwara T. J. Plant Nutr. Soil Sci. 2003; 166: 175-178Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Borate treatment rescues the dwarfism and the extent of RG-II cross-linking of the bor1 mutant. Thus, reduced cross-linking of RG-II is likely responsible for the dwarfed phenotype of the bor1 mutant. d-Apiose is only present in RG-II in the cell walls of most higher plants, and it serves as an attachment point for two highly complex side chains to the homogalacturonan backbone (10Stevenson T.T. Darvill A.G. Albersheim P. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 182: 207-226Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The two vicinal hydroxyl groups in the furanose ring of d-apiose form a cyclic diester with borate to result in RG-II cross-linking. Biosynthesis of d-apiose has been mostly studied in the duckweed Lemna minor and in parsley, where d-apiose is an abundant component of apiogalacturonan and apiin, respectively (11Golovchenko V.V. Ovodova R.G. Shashkov A.S. Ovodov Y.S. Phytochemistry. 2002; 60: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 12Hahlbrock K. Knobloch K.H. Kreuzaler F. Potts J.R. Wellmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 61: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In both duckweed and parsley, highly purified fractions of UDP-d-apiose synthase activity still contained UDP-d-xylose synthase activity, indicating that both reactions are catalyzed by a single enzyme, termed UDP-d-apiose/UDP-d-xylose synthase. Recently, Mølhøj et al. (13Mølhøj M. Verma R. Reiter W.-D. Plant J. 2003; 35: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) cloned the AXS1 gene encoding this synthase from Arabidopsis and demonstrated that the recombinant AXS1 protein indeed has both UDP-d-apiose synthase and UDP-d-xylose synthase activities. The Arabidopsis genome has a second gene (AXS2) that encodes a protein with 96% sequence identity to AXS1, and both genes are expressed in all Arabidopsis tissues. These results indicate that Arabidopsis has at least two UDP-d-apiose/UDP-d-xylose synthases. Consequently, an Arabidopsis line carrying a T-DNA within the AXS1 gene did not show any visible defects. 5R. Verma and W.-D. Reiter, unpublished results. 5R. Verma and W.-D. Reiter, unpublished results. In this study we show that depletion of UDP-d-apiose/UDP-d-xylose synthases results in RG-II deficiency in the cell walls by using VIGS of a Nicotiana benthamiana homolog of the AXS genes, designated NbAXS1. Cell wall abnormalities including incomplete walls and wall thickening were correlated with reduced levels of the RG-II-specific monosaccharides d-apiose, 2-O-methyl-l-fucose, and 2-O-methyl-d-xylose. Thus, the apparent dwarfism and cell death of the NbAXS1 VIGS plants were likely caused by RG-II deficiency due to a defect in the biosynthesis of UDP-d-apiose. Virus-induced Gene Silencing—N. benthamiana plants were grown in a growth room at 24 °C under a regime of 16 h of light and 8 h of dark. cDNA segments from NbAXS1 were PCR-amplified and cloned into the pTV00 vector containing a part of the tobacco rattle virus (TRV) genome (14Ratcliff F. Martin-Hernansez A.M. Baulcombe D.C. Plant J. 2001; 25: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) using BamHI and ApaI sites. Virus-induced gene silencing was carried out as described (15Kim M. Ahn J.-W. Jin O. Paek K.-H. Pai H.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19406-19415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). For RT-PCR analyses, the fourth leaf above the infiltrated leaf was used. DNA and RNA Gel Blot Analysis—For DNA gel blot analysis, the genomic DNA isolated from leaves of N. benthamiana was digested with EcoRI, HindIII, and EcoRV, electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel, and blotted onto Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Prehybridization and hybridization was carried out as described (16Lee S.S. Cho H.S. Yoon G.M. Ahn J.-W. Kim H.H. Pai H.-S. Plant J. 2003; 33: 825-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For RNA gel blot analysis using plant tissues, total RNA was prepared by using TRIzol™ reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 30 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on an agarose gel containing 5.1% (w/v) formaldehyde and blotted onto Hybond-N nylon membrane. Prehybridization and hybridization was carried out as described (16Lee S.S. Cho H.S. Yoon G.M. Ahn J.-W. Kim H.H. Pai H.-S. Plant J. 2003; 33: 825-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For DNA and RNA gel blot analyses, the probe was the 0.6-kb PCR fragment corresponding to the C-terminal region of the NbAXS1 cDNA. Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Semiquantitative RT-PCR was carried out using 5 μg of total RNA as described (16Lee S.S. Cho H.S. Yoon G.M. Ahn J.-W. Kim H.H. Pai H.-S. Plant J. 2003; 33: 825-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Primers for RT-PCR were made according to published cDNA sequences as described (15Kim M. Ahn J.-W. Jin O. Paek K.-H. Pai H.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19406-19415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Subcellular Localization of the NbAXS1 Protein—The NbAXS1 cDNA corresponding to the entire coding region was cloned into the 326-GFP plasmid (17Lee Y.J. Kim D.H. Kim Y.-W. Hwang I. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2175-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) using XbaI sites to generate the NbAXS1-GFP fusion protein. The fusion constructs were introduced into Arabidopsis protoplasts prepared from seedlings by polyethylene glycol-mediated transformation (18Abel S. Theologis A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 82: 209-217PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the fusion constructs was monitored by a confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM 510) at 24 h after transformation. The filter sets were BP505-530 (excitation 488 nm, emission 505-530 nm) and LP650 (excitation 488 nm, emission 650 nm) (Carl Zeiss) for green fluorescent protein and autofluorescence of chlorophyll, respectively. Western Blot Analysis of NbAXS1-GFP—GFP or NbAXS1-GFP fusion constructs were introduced into Arabidopsis protoplasts by polyethylene glycol-mediated transformation. At 24 h after transformation proteins were extracted from the protoplasts. As a control, proteins from untreated protoplasts were also prepared. Western blot analysis was carried out as described (16Lee S.S. Cho H.S. Yoon G.M. Ahn J.-W. Kim H.H. Pai H.-S. Plant J. 2003; 33: 825-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thirty μg of proteins were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with a polyclonal antibody raised against green fluorescent protein (GFP) (1:2000 dilution; Clontech). They were then reacted with anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:5000 dilution; Amersham Biosciences) and with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) for detection. Measurement of the Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (Molecular Probes) was added to protoplasts isolated from leaves of the VIGS lines at a final concentration of 200 nm. After incubation for 1-2 min at 37 °C, the protoplasts were transferred to wells on microscope slides and examined under a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM 510) with optical filters (543-nm excitation, 585-nm emission) to visualize the red fluorescent probe. Quantitative images were captured, and the data were analyzed using the LSM 510 program (Version 2.8). Measurement of H2O2 Production in Vivo—Protoplasts isolated from leaves of the VIGS lines were incubated in 2 mm 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA; Molecular Probes) for 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 s. Protoplasts were transferred to wells on microscope slides and examined under a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM 510) with optical filters (488 nm excitation, 505 nm emission) to visualize the oxidized green fluorescent probes. Measurement of Ion Leakage and Chlorophyll Contents, Detection of Autofluorescence, and Evans Blue Staining—After Agrobacterium infiltration, the fourth leaf above the infiltrated leaf from the TRV control and TRV:NbAXS1 lines was collected and analyzed. Measurement of membrane leakage, detection of autofluorescence, and Evans blue staining were performed as described (15Kim M. Ahn J.-W. Jin O. Paek K.-H. Pai H.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19406-19415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Total chlorophyll contents were measured as described (19Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4660) Google Scholar). Analysis of Starch Content—Leaves were harvested from the VIGS lines at 20 days after infiltration and bleached in 80% (v/v) ethanol. After rinsing with double-distilled water, the leaves were stained with Lugol's iodine staining reagent (Sigma) and briefly destained with water. Measurement of Peroxidase and Ascorbate Peroxidase Activity—Peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase activities were measured as described (15Kim M. Ahn J.-W. Jin O. Paek K.-H. Pai H.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19406-19415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—The fourth leaf above the infiltrated leaf from the TRV and TRV:NbAXS1 lines was fixed, processed, and embedded in Spurrs epoxy resin as described (20Lee H.-S. Karunanandaa B. McCubbin A. Gilroy S. Kao T.-H. Plant J. 1996; 9: 613-624Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Leaves were sectioned (1-μm-thick sections) with an ultramicrotome (model MT-600; Sorvall) and stained in 1% toluidine blue. Ultrathin leaf sections were then generated and placed on Formvar-coated copper grids, where they were stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate. The sections were observed in a JEOL electron microscope (model 100CX II) at 80 kV, and pictures were taken using Kodak Electron Microscope film no. 4489. Production of the Recombinant NbAXS1 Protein and Measurement of Its Enzyme Activity—The coding region of the NbAXS1 cDNA was PCR-amplified and cloned into the pET29a vector (Invitrogen) using NdeI and XhoI sites. Conditions for the induction of gene expression and the purification of recombinant NbAXS1 and AXS1 via nickel nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography were as described (13Mølhøj M. Verma R. Reiter W.-D. Plant J. 2003; 35: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Assays for UDP-d-apiose/UDP-d-xylose synthase activity were conducted with 3 μg of the purified recombinant protein, and the formation of products was monitored by gas liquid chromatography of alditol acetates as described (13Mølhøj M. Verma R. Reiter W.-D. Plant J. 2003; 35: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Monosaccharide Composition Analysis of the Cell Walls—A polysaccharide fraction containing predominantly cell wall material was prepared from the leaves of the VIGS lines by repeated extractions with 70% (v/v) ethanol as described (3Reiter W.-D. Chapple C.C.S. Somerville C.R. Science. 1993; 261: 1032-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The polysaccharide was hydrolyzed with sulfuric acid, and the monosaccharide composition was determined as alditol acetates by gas-liquid chromatography as described (3Reiter W.-D. Chapple C.C.S. Somerville C.R. Science. 1993; 261: 1032-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Because variable amounts of starch were found in the polysaccharide fraction, glucose was omitted from the calculation of the relative amounts of monosaccharide components. Virus-induced Gene Silencing of NbAXS1 Putatively Encoding UDP-d-apiose/UDP-d-xylose Synthase—Previously, we used TRV-based VIGS in N. benthamiana to assess the functions of various signaling genes and genes whose suppressed expression may be lethal in embryos or seedlings (15Kim M. Ahn J.-W. Jin O. Paek K.-H. Pai H.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19406-19415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 21Ahn J.-W. Kim M. Lim J.H. Kim G.-T. Pai H.-S. Plant J. 2004; 38: 969-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Park J.-A. Ahn J.-W. Kim Y.-K. Kim S.J. Kim J.-G. Kim W.T. Pai H.-S. Plant J. 2005; 42: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Approximately 15,000 ESTs were sequenced from three cDNA libraries constructed from various tissues of N. benthamiana, and >2,000 selected cDNAs were subjected to VIGS. The screening revealed that gene silencing of a homolog of Arabidopsis AXS genes encoding UDP-d-apiose/UDP-d-xylose synthase (13Mølhøj M. Verma R. Reiter W.-D. Plant J. 2003; 35: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) severely inhibited plant growth and caused premature leaf yellowing. The screening vector contained the full-length cDNA, which was designated NbAXS1. The NbAXS1 cDNA is 1656 bp in length and encodes a polypeptide of 387 amino acids corresponding to a molecular mass of 43,345 Da. The amino acid sequence of NbAXS1 was aligned with closely related sequences from Arabidopsis, tomato, potato, and rice (supplemental Fig. 1). NbAXS1 showed an 87-88% amino acid sequence identity to Arabidopsis AXS1 and AXS2 (13Mølhøj M. Verma R. Reiter W.-D. Plant J. 2003; 35: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and 94, 93, and 83% sequence identity to homologs of potato, tomato, and rice, respectively. Genomic Organization and Expression of NbAXS1—DNA gel blot analysis was performed with the genomic DNA from N. benthamiana digested with restriction enzymes (supplemental Fig. 2A). The probe was the 0.6-kb PCR fragment corresponding to the C-terminal region of the NbAXS1 cDNA. EcoRI digestion resulted in four hybridizing bands, whereas HindIII and EcoRV digestion showed three hybridizing bands. These results suggest that the N. benthamiana genome contains at least two NbAXS1-related genes. This result and our previous finding that the Arabidopsis T-DNA knock-out mutant of the AXS1 gene did not show any visible defects indicate that the VIGS phenotype observed in this study is likely to be caused by gene silencing of multiple NbAXS1-homologous genes. We examined expression of the NbAXS1 mRNAs in different tissues of N. benthamiana plants using RNA gel blot analysis. The ∼1.9-kb NbAXS1 transcripts were detected in roots, stems, leaves, and flowers at similar levels (supplemental Fig. 2B). UDP-d-apiose/UDP-d-xylose Synthase Activity of the Recombinant NbAXS1 Protein—To confirm that NbAXS1 indeed encodes a UDP-d-apiose/UDP-d-xylose synthase in N. benthamiana, the enzymatic activity of the recombinant NbAXS1 protein was examined in comparison with that of AXS1 from Arabidopsis (13Mølhøj M. Verma R. Reiter W.-D. Plant J. 2003; 35: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The coding region of the full-length NbAXS1 was cloned into the pET29a expression vector and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant NbAXS1 protein was affinity-purified using the C-terminal histidine tag, yielding a polypeptide ∼44 kDa in size, which is consistent with the predicted size of NbAXS1 (data not shown). After incubation of the recombinant NbAXS1 and AXS1 proteins with UDP-d-glucuronate, the reaction products were hydrolyzed, and the resulting monosaccharides were separated and quantified by gas liquid chromatography of alditol acetates. NbAXS1 converted UDP-d-glucuronate to a mixture of UDP-d-apiose and UDP-d-xylose as did AXS1 (Fig. 1A). In contrast, heat-inactivated NbAXS1 did not catalyze the reaction (Fig. 1A). These results demonstrate that NbAXS1 encodes a functional UDP-d-apiose/UDP-d-xylose synthase. A comparison of the kinetic parameters of NbAXS1 and AXS1 from Arabidopsis (13Mølhøj M. Verma R. Reiter W.-D. Plant J. 2003; 35: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) did not reveal any significant differences between the two enzymes. Similarly, the relative amounts of UDP-d-apiose and UDP-d-xylose produced by NbAXS1 and AXS1 were essentially the same (Fig. 1A). Subcellular Localization of the NbAXS1-GFP Fusion Protein—Subcellular distribution of the NbAXS1 protein in plant cells was examined by expressing a fusion protein between NbAXS1 and GFP. DNA constructs encoding NbAXS1-GFP or GFP alone under the control of the CaMV35S promoter were introduced into protoplasts isolated from Arabidopsis seedlings. After incubation at 25 °C, expression of the introduced genes was examined under a confocal laser scanning microscope with different filters to capture the image of GFP and autofluorescence of chlorophyll. After 24 h of incubation, the green fluorescent signal of the NbAXS1-GFP fusion protein was mostly localized in the cytosol, similar to the localization of a GFP control (Fig. 1B). To examine if the NbAXS1-GFP fusion protein is expressed intact in the protoplasts, the fusion protein was detected by using Western blotting (Fig. 1C). The NbAXS1-GFP fusion construct or the GFP vector alone were transformed into Arabidopsis protoplasts. As a control, the protoplasts were mock-transformed. After 24 h of incubation, total proteins were prepared and fractionated on SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed using the anti-GFP polyclonal antibody to detect GFP or NbAXS1-GFP fusion protein. The antibody visualized a ∼30-kDa protein band in the GFP-transformed fraction and a ∼75-kDa band in the NbAXS1-GFP-transformed fraction but none in the mock-transformed fraction. The size of the protein bands is consistent with the expected size of the GFP and the NbAXS1-GFP proteins, indicating that the green fluorescent signal detected in the NbAXS1-GFP-transformed protoplasts accurately depicts the subcellular localization of NbAXS1-GFP. VIGS Phenotypes and Suppression of the Endogenous NbAXS1 Transcripts—To confirm gene silencing of NbAXS1, four different fragments of the NbAXS1 cDNA were cloned into the TRV-based VIGS vector pTV00 (14Ratcliff F. Martin-Hernansez A.M. Baulcombe D.C. Plant J. 2001; 25: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), and N. benthamiana plants were infiltrated with Agrobacterium containing each plasmid (Fig. 2A). TRV:NbAXS1(N) and TRV:NbAXS1(C) contained a 0.6-kb N- and 0.6-kb C-terminal half of the coding region, respectively, whereas TRV:NbAXS1(F) contained a full-length NbAXS1-coding region. TRV:NbAXS1(T) contained a 90-bp cDNA fragment encoding the C-terminal end of the coding region. VIGS with all four constructs resulted in the same phenotype of growth arrest and senescence-like leaf yellowing (Fig. 2B). Newly emerged leaves were small and yellowish and made a leaf cluster near the shoot apex, and the stem growth was severely inhibited. The effects of gene silencing on the endogenous amounts of the NbAXS1 mRNA were examined by semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 2C). Primers for RT-PCR were designed to exclude the cDNA regions used in the VIGS constructs, and the transcript level for actin was measured as a control. RT-PCR using NbAXS1-N primers (Fig. 2A) that detect the N-terminal region of the NbAXS1 cDNA produced significantly reduced amounts of PCR products in the VIGS lines of TRV:NbAXS1(C) and TRV:NbAXS1(T) compared with the TRV control, indicating that the endogenous level of the NbAXS1 transcripts was greatly reduced in those plants. The same primers detected high levels of viral genomic transcripts containing the N-terminal region of NbAXS1 in the TRV:NbAXS1(N) and TRV:NbAXS1(F) lines. In contrast, NbAXS1-C primers (Fig. 2A) that recognize the C-terminal region of the cDNA showed suppression of the endogenous NbAXS1 transcripts in the TRV:NbAXS1(N) and TRV: NbAXS1(T) lines, whereas they detected the viral genomic transcripts in the TRV:NbAXS1(C) and TRV:NbAXS1(F) lines. The transcript levels of actin remained constant. These results demonstrate that expression of NbAXS1 was significantly reduced in the VIGS lines. Cell Wall Defects and Premature Cell Death—We examined cell morphology of the leaves from the TRV:NbAXS1 VIGS lines using light and transmission electron microscopy compared with a TRV control. Transverse leaf sections revealed that the TRV control leaves had the typical leaf structure of dicotyledonous plants with distinct adaxial and abaxial epidermal layers (Fig. 3, A and C). TRV:NbAXS1 lines showed swollen cells filled with dense granule-like structures (Fig. 3, B and D). Strikingly, some cells exhibited wall gaps (marked by the black arrows in Fig. 3, B and D), and a few seemed to be disintegrating with ruptured cell walls (marked by the white arrow in Fig. 3D). Despite these abnormalities, the number of cell layers and the typical dorsoventral organization of the palisade and mesophyll cells were mostly maintained in the TRV: NbAXS1 lines. The incomplete cell walls and cell rupturing observed in TRV:NbAXS1 lines indicate that depletion of NbAXS1 causes abnormal cell wall biogenesis. Transmission electron microscopic analysis of the leaf cells of the TRV: NbAXS1 lines showed dramatic degeneration of organelles and cellular ultrastructure (Fig. 3F, cf. control in Fig. 3E). The cells contained reduced amounts of cytosol, apparently no or an abnormal nucleus, and reduced numbers of chloroplasts. Some of the chloroplasts were undergoing degradation (marked by the arrows in Fig. 3F). The cells accumulated a large number of electron-dense particles that are likely the remains of disintegrating chloroplasts and other cellular compartments (Fig. 3F). Accumulation of Cell Death-related Markers and Excessive Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Production—The physiology of the cell death phenotype in NbAXS1 VIGS lines was examined. We stained the detached leaves of the VIGS lines with Evans blue, a dye that is excluded by the membranes of living cells but diffuses into dead cells. The TRV: NbAXS1 lines exhibited black staining in"

We show, using a proteomics-based approach, that the valosin-containing protein (VCP), a member of the AAA (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) family, is a target of Akt signaling. SDS-PAGE of Akt co-immunoprecipitated proteins obtained from MCF-7 breast cancer cells revealed the increase of a 97-kDa band under Akt activation. Mass spectrometry analysis allowed the identification of VCP, and we have shown a serine/threonine phosphorylation on an Akt consensus site upon activation by growth factors. Site-directed mutagenesis identified Ser-351, Ser-745, and Ser-747 as Akt phosphorylation sites on VCP. Confocal microscopy indicated a co-localization between Akt and VCP upon Akt stimulation. Interestingly, small interfering RNA against VCP induced an inhibition of the growth factor-induced activation of NF-κB and a potent pro-apoptotic effect. Together, these data identify VCP as an essential target of Akt signaling.

Mogk A. Zeth K. Turgay K. Bukau B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 2Lupas A.N. Martin J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). VCP, also known as VAT in archaebacteria, CDC48p in yeast, TER94 in Drosophilia, and p97 in Xenopus, is one of the most evolutionarily conserved proteins that is ubiquitous and abundant in cells, accounting for more than 1% of total cellular proteins. Like other AAA proteins, VCP has been shown to be involved in a wide variety of ATP-dependent cellular processes such as ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, DNA repair, membrane fusion and dynamics of subcellular compartments, gene expression, and cell growth. Admittedly, it acts as a molecular chaperone that unfolds or unwinds proteins, although the detailed mechanisms of VCP function remain to be determined, as well as its regulation mechanisms in both physiological and pathological conditions. During the course of studying the molecular partners of the serine/threonine kinase Akt, a key regulator of cell survival that is activated by growth factors, we detected VCP in Akt co-immunoprecipitated material. The interaction between Akt and VCP was further studied, and from the functional point of view, we showed that disruption of VCP using siRNA impaired the cell survival signaling mediated by Akt. We propose that VCP is an important player in the Akt-mediated signaling of cell survival. Materials—Cell culture reagents were purchased from BioWhittaker. Recombinant human fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) was from R&D systems. Wortmannin (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor) was from Calbiochem. C2 ceramide analogue (N-acetyl-d-sphingosine), 5-fluorouracil, camptothecin, etoposide, Hoechst 33258, G250 Coomassie Brilliant Blue, Me2SO, and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibody were from Sigma. Dynabeads M-280 tosylactivated were from Dynal Biotech. Constitutively active Akt and wild-type Akt pUSE-encoding plasmids were from Upstate Biotechnology. Cell Culture, NF-κB Activation, and Induction of Apoptosis—Breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T-47D, and BT-20 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and routinely grown as monolayers as described previously (3El Yazidi-Belkoura I. Adriaenssens E. Dolle L. Descamps S. Hondermarck H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16952-16956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Apoptosis of MCF-7 cells was induced by treatment with ceramide analogue C2 (10 μm for 24 h), previously described as a pro-apoptotic agent for human breast cancer cells (4Cuvillier O. Nava V.E. Murthy S.K. Edsall L.C. Levade T. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The determinations of both the NF-κB activation (luciferase reporter assay) and the proportion of cells in apoptosis (Hoechst staining) were performed as described (3El Yazidi-Belkoura I. Adriaenssens E. Dolle L. Descamps S. Hondermarck H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16952-16956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For apoptosis induction by chemotherapeutic agents, MCF-7 breast cancer cells were treated for 3 h with 5-fluorouracil (100 μm), camptothecin (0.1 nm), or etoposide (10 μm) and replaced in new culture medium. After 24 h, cells were fixed with cold methanol (-20 °C) for 10 min and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before staining with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 and apoptosis quantification. Immunoprecipitation of Akt and Interacting Proteins—MCF-7 cells were rinsed by PBS, pH 7.5, serum-starved for 3 h in minimum essential medium (minimum Eagle's medium-Earle's salts), and treated for 24 h by 10 μm C2 ceramide in fresh minimal essential medium. Proteins were extracted from cells after 10 min of 5 ng/ml FGF-2 stimulation in 100 μm pervanadate. To inhibit PI3K/Akt, cells were pretreated for 3 h by 100 nm wortmannin before FGF-2 stimulation. Then, cells were rinsed with PBS, pH 7.5, and scratched in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate). After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 5 min), proteins were quantified using Bradford's method (Bio-Rad). Akt and interacting proteins were co-immunoprecipitated from equal quantities of proteins using antibodies covalently bound to magnetic beads, according to Dynal Biotech protocol using 2.5 μg of anti-Akt for 500 μg of total proteins. Immunoprecipitated material was rinsed three times by PBS, pH 7.5, before a 5-min boiling in Laemmli buffer 1×. Gradient Gel Electrophoresis—Akt immunoprecipitated material was solubilized in SDS solution (0.3% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol) before SDS-PAGE migration and colloidal blue staining (G250 brilliant blue). Protein Identification by Mass Spectrometry—Protein identification was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS). The protein band of interest was trypsin-digested as described previously (5Vercoutter-Edouart A.S. Lemoine J. Le Bourhis X. Louis H. Boilly B. Nurcombe V. Revillion F. Peyrat J.P. Hondermarck H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 76-80PubMed Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF and MS-MS analysis of the trypsin digests were performed on a Voyager reflector instrument (Applied Biosystems) and a Q-STAR (PerSeptive Biosystems) in positive ion mode. For MALDI-TOF, mass measurements were made after peak smoothing and internal calibration using the average mass of the two autolysis trypsin fragment ions at m/z 842.510 and 2211.105. Protein sequence data base searching was performed with MS-Fit and Mascot. Western Blotting—Co-immunoprecipated proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with anti-VCP (1/2000), anti-Akt, and anti-phospho-(Ser/Thr) Akt substrate antibodies in experimental conditions described in Ref. 3El Yazidi-Belkoura I.

Confocal Microscopy—After Akt activation using FGF-2, cells were successively rinsed with PBS, pH 7.5, fixed 20 min with paraformaldehyde 4%, permeabilized for 20 min at room temperature with PBS, pH 7.5; 0.05% saponine; 50 mm ammonium chloride, and blocked for 30 min with PBS, pH 7.5; 0.05% saponine; 2% bovine serumalbumine. Then, cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in a blocking solution containing 1/50 rabbit phospho-Akt antibody (Cell Signaling) and 1/50 mouse VCP antibody (Abcam) rinsed with PBS, pH 7.5, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a blocking solution containing 1/4000 Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG and 1/3000 Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG. Cells were rinsed with PBS and mounted under Mowiol. VCP RNA Interference—VCP siRNA was designed and validated as described by Wójcik et al. (6Wojcik C. Yano M. DeMartino G.N. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Corresponding sequences are forward, 5′-TAAGACGCTGCTGGCCAA-3′, and reverse, 5′-CATCGCGGAGTTCTGATTTT-3′. The siRNAs were synthesized using the Silencer® siRNA construction kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and transfection was performed as described previously (7Vandermoere F. El Yazidi-Belkoura I. Adriaenssens E. Lemoine J. Hondermarck H. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5482-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis of VCP—CDNA of VCP was obtained by PCR on MCF-7 cells from the cDNA data base using the following primers that incorporated the KnpI site and NotI site at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, of the cDNA of VCP: Vcp-dir+KpnI, 5′-ATCGGTACCGCTCGTAGCCGTTACC-3′, Vcp-rev+NotI, 5′-ATGCGGCCGCTGAACTGTTCAGACTGGAG-3′. The PCR product was inserted in the topoA vector and amplified in Escherichia coli bacteria. Then, double digestion by KnpI and NotI was used to insert VCP cDNA in CMVTNT vector that allowed expression in mammalian cells. VCP serine 351 mutation to Alanine S351A,S745A,S747A and a triple mutant were carried out using PCR with mutant primers. The primers used to generate the mutants were as follows: S351A, 5′-GACCCAACGCCATTGACCC-3′; S745A, 5′-GCCCGACGTGCTGTCAGCG-3′; S747A, 5′-CGACGTTCTGTCGACGATAATGAC-3′; and S745AS747A, 5′CGACGTGCTGTCGCCGATAATG-3′. Cloning and mutation were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression of pCMVTNT-VCP, pCMVTNT-VCPS351A, pCMVTNT-VCPS745A, pCMVTNT-VCPS747A, and pCMVTNT-VCPS351AS745-AS747A plasmids was carried out by transfection in MCF-7 cells. VCP Is Co-immunoprecipitated with Activated Akt—The protocol used for identification of VCP in Akt co-immunoprecipitates is summarized in Fig. 1A. Immunoprecipitates obtained with Akt antibodies were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Two experimental conditions were compared. In the first, Akt was not activated, and in the second, Akt was activated by cell stimulation with FGF-2. Silver staining or Coomassie Blue staining of the gel revealed the appearance of a 97-kDa band in the Akt-stimulated condition (Fig. 1B). The equal loading was assessed by detection of Akt (60 kDa) and IgG (70 kDa). The 97-kDa band was cut out and trypsin-digested before mass spectrometry analysis. Mass spectra from MALDI-TOF (Fig. 1C) and MS-MS (Fig. 1D) allowed the establishment of a peptide mass fingerprint and amino acid sequence, respectively, thereby leading to the identification of VCP. From the peptide fingerprint, a total of 31 experimental masses matched theoretical masses from VCP, leading to a protein sequence covering of 23%, and this identification was reinforced by the sequencing of 12 consecutive amino acids (Table 1).TABLE 1Identification of VCP, from MALDI-TOF obtained peptide masses The amino acid sequence from the Swiss-Prot database of each matching peptide, the Δ mass between measured and matched masses, and the number of cleavages missed by trypsin are reported.

Importantly, reverse co-immunoprecipitation with anti-VCP antibody, followed by anti-Akt Western blotting, led to the same result (Fig. 2B), hence confirming the interaction between Akt and VCP upon fibroblast growth factor-2 stimulation. The interaction was further confirmed in different breast cancer cell types and under stimulation by insulin-like growth factor 1 and epidermal growth factor (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the interaction between VCP and Akt was abolished by treatment of the cells with the PI3K/Akt pharmacological inhibitor wortmannin (Fig. 2B), thus indicating the requirement of Akt activation for interaction with VCP. Using anti-phospho-Akt substrate (PAS) antibody, which recognizes phosphorylated serine or threonine in a consensus site for Akt, we have been able to show that Akt activation resulted in VCP phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). This Western blotting experiment showed that VCP contained a serine or a threonine phosphorylated, upon growth factor stimulation, on a site corresponding to Akt phosphorylation consensus. Interestingly, treatment by wortmannin resulted in a decrease in VCP phosphorylation, confirming that VCP is a target of Akt signaling. Identification of Akt Phosphorylation Sites on VCP—In our study, we demonstrated that FGF-2 stimulates both the interaction between Akt and VCP and the phosphorylation of VCP on a site recognized by the PAS antibody. The Akt-phosphorylated consensus site is commonly defined as RXRXX(S/T) (8Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 9Obata T. Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Piro E.T. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. Kikkawa R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36108-36115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). We performed a bioinformatics search to identify putative Akt phosphorylation sites on VCP using the Scansite software. The putative Akt phosphorylation sites on VCP are AATNRPNS351, AMRFARRS745, and RFARRSVS747. To test the involvement of Ser-351, Ser-745, and Ser-747, we performed site-directed mutagenesis and generated pCMVTNT-VCPS351A, pCMVTNT-VCPS745A, and pCMVTNT-VCPS747A and pCMVTNT-VCPS351AS745AS747A. These VCP wild-type and mutant cDNAs were transfected in MCF-7 cells in parallel with Akt constitutively activated (AktCA), and after immunoprecipitation, phosphorylation on Akt consensus site was detected with the PAS antibody. The results (Fig. 2D) show that wild-type VCP was phosphorylated on PAS consensus to a greater extent as compared with S351A, S745A, and S748A mutants. The triple mutant S351A,S745A,S747A was phosphorylated to an even lesser extent as no phosphorylation was detected. These results indicate that Ser-351, Ser-745, and Ser-747 are Akt phosphorylation sites on VCP. VCP Is Functionally Involved in Akt Antiapoptotic Signaling and Is Required for Cell Survival—The functional involvement of VCP in Akt signaling was shown by the treatment of MCF-7 cells with siRNA directed against Akt or VCP. Treatment by 100 nm siRNA directed against Akt or VCP resulted in a strong reduction of the pro-survival effect of FGF-2 for breast cancer cells (Fig. 3A). Similarly, transfection with the triple VCP mutant S351A,S745A,S747A resulted in a reduction of FGF-2 anti-apoptotic activity, confirming the functional involvement of the detected phosphorylation site. Negative dominant Akt also resulted in the inhibition of FGF-2 survival effect, in contrast with constitutively activated Akt. It has been previously demonstrated that the Akt-mediated anti-antiapoptotic signaling in breast cancer cells requires the activation of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (7Vandermoere F. El Yazidi-Belkoura I. Adriaenssens E. Lemoine J. Hondermarck H. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5482-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We have evaluated the impact of VCP on NF-κB activation induced by Akt. Treatment with 100 nm siRNA directed against Akt or VCP, as well as transfection with dominant negative Akt or VCP mutant S351A,S745A,S747A, resulted in a strong inhibition of NF-κB activation by FGF-2 (Fig. 3B). The efficiency of cell treatment by siRNA directed against Akt and VCP was demonstrated by Western blotting showing the disappearance of Akt and VCP with increasing concentrations of siRNA (Fig. 3C). Together, these data show that VCP is involved in the growth factor-stimulated antiapoptotic signaling mediated by Akt. Interestingly, high concentrations of siRNA against VCP were shown to induce a potent apoptosis in breast cancer cells that was not rescued by overexpression of a dominant active Akt mutant (Fig. 4A). Cell treatment with increasing concentrations of siRNA against VCP resulted in increase of breast cancer cell death, and it is worth noting that for identical concentrations, no apoptosis was induced by the control siRNA. For example, 50% of apoptosis was observed for 150 nm siRNA against VCP after a 48-h treatment, whereas no induction of cell death was detected with control siRNA. In conclusion, VCP depletion dramatically induced, by itself, a massive apoptosis in breast cancer cells, demonstrating the crucial role played by this protein in cell survival. Interestingly, siRNA directed against VCP were found to induce a decrease in the level of phospho-IκBα (Fig. 4B). This is consistent with the decrease of NF-κB activation that was also observed when cells were treated with siRNA against VCP (Fig. 3B). Moreover, we have shown that depletion in VCP resulted in a potentiation of the pro-apoptotic effect of various chemotherapeutic drugs (Fig. 4C). The proapototic effect of 5-fluorouracil, camptothecine, and etoposide obtained with MCF-7 cells was potentiated by siRNA directed against VCP (at the 100 nm dose that has no apoptotic effect by itself). This demonstrates the significance of VCP under conditions of apoptosis induced by anti-cancer treatment drugs. The serine/threonine kinase Akt is increasingly appearing as a general mediator of cell survival signaling, with high potentialities as a drug target in various diseases characterized by a deregulation of the balance between cell apoptosis and cell growth, such as cancer (10Luo J. Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Akt is mainly, but not exclusively, activated through the PI3K pathway that is stimulated by a wide range of tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors. Although Akt signaling remains incompletely known, it noticeably promotes cell survival by indirectly activating the pro-survival transcription factor NF-κB, through the stimulation of the inhibitor IκB kinase. Akt activation of IκB kinase results in the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκB through the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome proteolysis, allowing NF-κB to translocate into the nucleus, where it stimulates target gene expression (11Karin M. Yamamoto Y. Wang Q.M. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2004; 3: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). Due to its involvement in several pathologies such as cancer, the signaling initiated by Akt is the subject of increasing attention, and we indicate here the involvement of VCP in the growth factor-induced antiapoptotic signaling mediated by the Akt/NF-κB pathway. In contrast to classical approaches to studying signal transduction (based on the use of specific antibodies to identify signaling partners), proteomic approaches have the advantage of allowing the identification of unexpected partners, and this is of considerable potential for defining new therapeutic targets in pathologies such as breast cancer (12Hondermarck H. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2003; 2: 281-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Interestingly, VCP has previously been shown to associate directly with the α form of IκB (IκBα) and is co-purified with the mammalian 26 S proteasome involved in the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation pathway of IκBα (13Dai R.M. Chen E. Longo D.L. Gorbea C.M. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3562-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 14Dai R.M. Li C.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). In breast cancer cells, growth factors such as FGF-2 and nerve growth factor have been shown to stimulate cell growth and survival through the activation of a PI3K/Akt/NF-κB-mediated pathway (7Vandermoere F. El Yazidi-Belkoura I. Adriaenssens E. Lemoine J. Hondermarck H. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5482-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 15Descamps S. Toillon R.A. Adriaenssens E. Pawlowski V.

Freeman K.W. Chen M. Contreras A. Spencer D.M. Rosen J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In this context, our results indicate that the NF-κB activation and the subsequent effects on cell survival are functionally regulated through the recruitment and phosphorylation of VCP by the Akt pathway. The Akt-phosphorylated consensus site is commonly defined as RXRXX(S/T) (8Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 9Obata T. Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Piro E.T. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. Kikkawa R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36108-36115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In fact, the primary sequence of VCP does not contain the precise consensus sequence predicted for an Akt substrate; the arginine at position -5 is lacking. However, VCP encodes a peptide sequence that is consistent with a pattern of other Akt-phosphorylated targets, where arginine at position -5 is not present as in insulin-response element-binding protein 1 (KERCQS1036) (17Villafuerte B.C. Phillips L.S. Rane M.J. Zhao W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36650-36659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), cAMP-response element-binding protein LSRRPS133Y (18Du K. Montminy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32377-32379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar), and ATP-citrate lyase (TPAPS TASF) (19Berwick D.C. Hers I. Heesom K.J. Moule S.K. Tavare J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33895-33900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The bioinformatic analysis performed with Scansite indicated three potential Akt phosphorylation sites in VCP, and we have used site-directed mutagenesis to confirm their involvement. We demonstrated that Ser-351, Ser-745, and Ser-747 on VCP are phosphorylated on a site recognized by the PAS antibody corresponding to the Akt consensus site. The phosphospecific Akt substrate antibody (PAS) that we have used here was raised against Akt RXRXX(pS/pT) consensus sequence but does not appear to strictly require arginine in the -5 position for phosphoprotein recognition, as was obtained for ATP-citrate lyase (19Berwick D.C. Hers I. Heesom K.J. Moule S.K. Tavare J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33895-33900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in rat hippocampal tissue, a functional integration between Akt and VCP that also leads to VCP phosphorylation on the same corresponding serine residues has very recently been shown (20Klein J.B. Barati M.T. Wu R. Gozal D. Sachleben Jr., L.R. Kausar H. Trent J.O. Gozal E. Rane M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31870-31881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, these three serine residues appear to be generally crucial for VCP regulation by Akt. VCP is known to interact with other adaptor proteins, which are proposed to function in various cellular pathways. The list of proteins known to interact with VCP includes clathrin (21Pleasure I.T. Black M.M. Keen J.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 459-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the p47 membrane fusion required for organelle biogenesis (22Kondo H. Rabouille C. Newman R. Levine T.P. Pappin D. Freemont P. Warren G. Nature. 1997; 388: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), the VCP p97/p47 complex-interacting protein (VCPIP135) (23Uchiyama K. Jokitalo E. Kano F. Murata M. Zhang X. Canas B. Newman R. Rabouille C. Pappin D. Freemont P. Kondo H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), the small VCP-interacting protein (24Nagahama M. Suzuki M. Hamada Y. Hatsuzawa K. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Tagaya M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and the breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility gene product (BRCA1) (25Zhang H. Wang Q. Kajino K. Greene M.I. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). BRCA1 is of particular interest in the context of breast cancer as this protein is one of the most prominent players identified in breast tumorigenesis, with 50% of familial breast tumors exhibiting BRCA1 mutations (26Venkitaraman A.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). BRCA1 presumably acts as a DNA-unwinding factor in DNA damage repair, although VCP is predominantly found in the cytoplasm and less abundantly in the nucleus. However, VCP can be translocated to the nucleus, and in vitro studies have revealed that VCP, via its N-terminal region, binds to amino acid residues 303–625 in the BRCA1 protein (25Zhang H. Wang Q. Kajino K. Greene M.I. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the cell growth regulator heregulin has been shown to induce phosphorylation of BRCA1 through PI3 kinase/Akt in breast cancer cells (27Altiok S. Batt D. Altiok N. Papautsky A. Downward J. Roberts T.M. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32274-32278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and therefore, our data suggest that VCP might participate in the interaction between Akt and BRCA1, leading to DNA damage repair function and an antiapoptotic effect under growth factor stimulation. However, our study also suggests that other known biological activities of VCP, such as those related to intracellular trafficking, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and activation of transcription (28Wang Q. Song C. Li C.C. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), might be regulated by Akt through the activation of VCP. In our study, a potent induction of apoptosis was observed in breast cancer cells treated with siRNA against VCP, thereby demonstrating the crucial role played by this protein in the survival of cancer cells. VCP has been described as an important regulator of protein ubiquitination, and interestingly, it was reported before that VCP is involved in the ubiquitin proteasome-mediated degradation of IκB (13Dai R.M. Chen E. Longo D.L. Gorbea C.M. Li C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3562-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In our study, we demonstrated that siRNA directed against VCP induced a decrease in the level of phospho-IκB. As the phosphorylation of IκB is the germane event leading to the proteolytic proteasome-mediated degradation of IκB responsible for the release and nuclear translocation of NF-κB, the decrease in phospho-IκB that we observe with siRNA directed against VCP is consistent with the concomitant inhibition of NF-κB and provides a biochemical basis for the cell survival activity of VCP. In addition, the potential of VCP as a therapeutic target is particularly well illustrated by the potentiation of the proapototic effect of chemotherapeutic drugs that we have obtained with anti-VCP siRNA. Hence, VCP targeting appears as a rational approach to sensitize breast cancer cells to chemotherapy. In conclusion, we identified VCP as an essential new target in the Akt signaling pathway that is necessary to its related antiapoptotic effect, and therefore, this protein appears as a new player to be considered in cancer cell survival, with a correlative potential as a target for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1969343479,"Most Bcl-2 family members can localize to intracellular membranes via hydrophobic sequences within their C-terminal portion. We found that the C terminus of the anti-apoptotic family member A1 did not function as a membrane anchor. Instead, this stretch of the protein rendered A1 highly unstable by mediating its polyubiquitination and rapid proteasomal degradation. Moreover, the domain did not only function independently of its position within the A1 protein but when transfered could even destabilize unrelated proteins like enhanced green fluorescent protein and caspase-3. A1 was, however, much more stable in the presence of the Bcl-2 homology-only protein BimEL, suggesting that direct interaction of A1 with pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family strongly reduces its rate of turnover. We further show that the C-terminal end of A1 also contributes to the anti-apoptotic capacity of the protein. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the C terminus serves a dual function by controlling the stability of A1 and by amplifying the capacity of the protein to protect cells against apoptosis.

Apoptosis plays a critical role in tissue development and homeostasis. This is witnessed by the fact that a number of mammalian pathologies, including cancers and autoimmune and degenerative disorders, arise as a consequence of apoptotic processes going awry (1Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6177) Google Scholar). Many apoptotic pathways converge at the mitochondria where they induce permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and subsequently the release of death-inducing factors such as cytochrome c (2Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The stability of the outer mitochondrial membrane is controlled by members of the Bcl-2 family (4Green D.R. Kroemer G. Science. 2004; 305: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar), which are characterized by the presence of between one and four conserved regions termed Bcl-2 homology (BH) 4The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl-2 homology; Casp3, caspase-3; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; DTT, dithiothreitol; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; MCS, multiple cloning site. 4The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl-2 homology; Casp3, caspase-3; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; DTT, dithiothreitol; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; MCS, multiple cloning site. domains (5Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 family consists of both pro- and anti-apoptotic members. The pro-apoptotic members can be further subdivided into those that possess multiple (two or three) BH domains, such as Bax and Bak, and those that possess only the short BH3 domain, such as Bim, Bad, Bid, and Noxa. The “BH3-only” proteins are thought to serve as sensors for different apoptotic stimuli and are stringently regulated at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels (6Puthalakath H. Strasser A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The “multidomain” members, which are also referred to as “Bax/Bak-like” proteins, function downstream of their BH3-only relatives and are responsible for the formation of pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane (7Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3329) Google Scholar). The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, of which Bcl-2 is the prototype, appear to protect the integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane by sequestering and thereby neutralizing the pro-apoptotic family members (8Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar, 9Zha H. Aime-Sempe C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol.

Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). Current models of apoptosis posit that the fate of a cell exposed to an apoptotic stimulus will depend on the balance between the pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (11Strasser A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). One well recognized mechanism for regulating protein levels is via ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation (12Jesenberger V. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Levels of Bim, for example, are normally kept low as a consequence of constitutive ERK1/2-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the protein (13Luciano F. Jacquel A. Colosetti P. Herrant M. Cagnol S. Pages G. Auberger P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6785-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Serum withdrawal, however, causes ERK1/2 activity to decline and levels of Bim to rise (14Akiyama T. Bouillet P. Miyazaki T. Kadono Y. Chikuda H. Chung U.I. Fukuda A. Hikita A. Seto H. Okada T. Inaba T. Sanjay A. Baron R. Kawaguchi H. Oda H. Nakamura K. Strasser A. Tanaka S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6653-6664Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In contrast, certain pathogens, including Chlamydia and Epstein-Barr virus, appear to promote cell survival by increasing the rate at which Bim is degraded by proteasomes (15Fischer S.F. Vier J. Kirschnek S. Klos A. Hess S. Ying S. Hacker G. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 905-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 16Clybouw C. McHichi B. Mouhamad S. Auffredou M.T. Bourgeade M.F. Sharma S. Leca G. Vazquez A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 2968-2973Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). There is mounting evidence that levels of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members are also regulated via the proteasome. Bcl-2 itself appears to be protected from proteasomal degradation by ERK1/2 phosphorylation (17Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Malchow P. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2005; 121: 1085-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). This study focuses on the anti-apoptotic factor A1. A1 and its human homolog Bfl-1 share the four conserved BH domains of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (19Lin E.Y. Orlofsky A. Berger M.S. Prystowsky M.B. J.

Overexpression studies in cell lines and mice have shown that it affords protection from various forms of apoptosis (21Zong W.X. Edelstein L.C. Chen C. Bash J. Gelinas C.

In vitro studies have convincingly demonstrated that it can interact with Bim, Bid, Puma, and Noxa (25Werner A.B. de Vries E. Tait S.W. Bontjer I. Borst J. J. Biol.

However, there are conflicting reports as to the subcellular distribution of A1 with independent studies locating it at the nucleus (27Somogyi R.D. Wu Y. Orlofsky A. Prystowsky M.B. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), at the mitochondrial membrane (28Duriez P.J. Wong F. Dorovini-Zis K. Shahidi R. Karsan A. J. Biol.

Other anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members are targeted to intracellular membranes via a conserved stretch of hydrophobic amino acid residues in their C termini (29Kaufmann T. Schlipf S. Sanz J. Neubert K. Stein R. Borner C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The C terminus of A1 lacks this typical transmembrane domain, raising questions over the role the C terminus plays in its localization and, as a corollary, in its anti-apoptotic function. Here we show that the C terminus of A1 does not fulfill any specific targeting function but rather controls the short half-life of the protein. Interestingly, we observe an increased half-life of A1 in the presence of BimEL. Finally, we demonstrate that the C terminus of A1 also contributes to the anti-apoptotic potential of the protein. Reagents—Cycloheximide, DTT, protease inhibitor mixture (P8340), and lipopolysaccharide (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were purchased from Sigma. Etoposide and proteasome inhibitor II were purchased from Calbiochem. Cell Culture—WEHI 231 cells (murine B cell lymphoma line), Daudi cells (human Burkitt lymphoma line), and 293T cells (human embryonic kidney cell line 293 expressing SV40 T antigen) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. High density primary B cells (≥1.807 g/ml) were prepared as described (30Berberich I. Schimpl A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 31Schliephake D.E. Schimpl A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 268-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) by a stepwise Percoll gradient (Amersham Biosciences). B cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 4.8 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1× nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, streptomycin (0.2 mg/ml), penicillin (400 units/ml). The murine B cell media contained in additionβ-mercaptoethanol (5 × 10-5 m). The 293T cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and streptomycin/penicillin as mentioned above. For activation of the primary B cells, lipopolysaccharide (P. aeruginosa) (10 μg/ml) was added to the cultures. Plasmids—The bicistronic retroviral vector pEYZ/MCS containing a chimeric selection marker consisting of the enhanced yellow fluorescent (Y) and the Zeocin resistance (Z) proteins was previously described (22Kuss A.W. Knodel M. Berberich-Siebelt F. Lindemann D. Schimpl A. Berberich I. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3077-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). pEGZ/MCS is analogous to pEYZ/MCS but contains the EGFP (G) fused to the Zeocin resistance protein (Z). The plasmid pred/MCS contains only the dsRed fluorescent protein (red). Coding sequences for the individual proteins used were PCR-amplified according to sequences obtained from the NCBI data base. Detailed information on the constructs is available on request. Transfection/Infection Assays and Cell Sorting—Recombinant retroviral particles were generated by using the pHIT packaging system essentially as described by Soneoka et al. (32Soneoka Y. Cannon P.M. Ramsdale E.E. Griffiths J.C. Romano G. Kingsman S.M. Kingsman A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Transfection of 293T cells and infection of WEHI 231 or primary splenic mouse B cells have been described previously (22Kuss A.W. Knodel M. Berberich-Siebelt F. Lindemann D. Schimpl A. Berberich I. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3077-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Transduced cells were highly enriched (>80%) either by treatment with 250 μg/ml Zeocin and/or by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACSvantage; BD Biosciences). Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—293T cells were transduced with wild type or C-terminally modified EGFPs by vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotyped recombinant retroviruses and grown on coverslips for 24 h before staining with Mitotracker CMXRos (10 nm) (Molecular Probes) for 30 min in cell culture medium. Thereafter, cells were washed twice with cell culture medium and directly placed on microscope slides with a drop of cell culture medium for live microscopy. Images were obtained using an LSM510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) and acquired with a Zeiss laser scanning microscope LSM 510 software 3.2 SP2. Preparation of the Anti-A1 Antiserum—A fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase and mouse A1-155 was produced in the E. coli strain BL21(DE). Rabbits were repeatedly immunized with this protein to obtain the specific anti-A1 antiserum (Coring Systems Diagnostix). Western Blot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—Whole-cell lysates were prepared by lysing 3 × 105 cells in 25 μl of 6× Laemmli buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and analyzed by Western blotting. Polyclonal anti-caspase-3 (catalog number 9662) antibody was obtained from New England Biolabs. The monoclonal mouse anti-FLAG (M2) antibody was purchased from Sigma. The monoclonal anti Bcl-2 (C-2) antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The monoclonal green fluorescent protein (catalog number 632375) antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. The monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5) antibody was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Detection was achieved using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Dianova) and the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). To identify ubiquitinated forms of A1, 293T cells were transiently transfected with various expression constructs (as indicated) in combination with an HA-tagged ubiquitin construct. 48 h after transfection cells were incubated with the proteasome inhibitor II (10 mm) for 1 h. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1:100 protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm DTT), and proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody or the anti-A1 antiserum. The immunoprecipitate was resolved via SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the conjugates were detected with an anti-HA antibody. As a control for the expression of A1 protein, Western blot analysis was performed with an anti-FLAG antibody or the anti-A1 antiserum. For immunoprecipitation assays, 293T cells were transiently transfected with various constructs of A1 and N-terminal HA-tagged BimEL. Cells were lysed in 0.2% Nonidet P-40 buffer (150 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1:100 protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm DTT), and proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-FLAG antibody. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis was carried out with an anti-FLAG or an anti-HA antibody. Stability of Proteins in Vivo—3 × 108 WEHI 231 wild type or 3 × 107 A1 transduced WEHI 231 cells were starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine and cysteine for 1 h. During metabolic labeling with l-[35S]methionine and l-[35S]cysteine (Amersham Biosciences), cells were kept at a density of 3 × 106/ml for 2 h. The cells were then chased in nonradioactive medium for the time periods indicated. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer at 4 °C for 20 min. Samples containing equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated, collected with immobilized protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried, and proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Determination of Cell Viability—Cell survival was determined by staining the cells with annexin V-Cy5 (BD Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS-Calibur; BD Biosciences). The C Terminus of A1 Is Not Sufficient to Target Proteins to Intracellular Membranes—Most Bcl-2 family members can be anchored to intracellular membranes by hydrophobic amino acid residues in their C termini (33Schinzel A. Kaufmann T. Borner C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1644: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, the accumulation of hydrophobic residues at the C-terminal end of A1 is interrupted by hydrophilic amino acids that most likely interfere with efficient membrane targeting (Fig. 1A). To directly test the potential of the C-terminal end of A1 to anchor a protein to intracellular membranes, we fused the last 35 amino acids of A1 to the C terminus of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP-A1ct). We chose this approach because Kaufmann et al. (29Kaufmann T. Schlipf S. Sanz J. Neubert K. Stein R. Borner C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) previously showed that attaching the C termini of Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL to EGFP is sufficient to induce membrane localization of the chimeric proteins. We transduced 293T cells using recombinant retroviruses and analyzed the distribution of the fluorescent proteins by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1B). As expected, the C-terminal residues of A1 were not sufficient to direct the chimeric protein EGFP-A1ct to intracellular membranes, i.e. like the wild type EGFP, EGFP-A1ct was evenly distributed throughout the cell. In contrast, EGFP-Bcl2ct was found at several intracellular membranes, although EGFP-Bcl-XLct was mainly localized at mitochondrial membranes (Fig. 1B). Thus, our results indicate that the C terminus of A1 has no membrane targeting function and does not direct a specific localization within the cell. A1 Is a Short Lived Protein—Next, we addressed the question of whether the C terminus of A1 is redundant for the protein. To this end, we generated a mutant of A1 lacking 17 amino acids at the C terminus. Because no commercial antibodies were available to detect A1 at that time, we used N-terminally FLAG-tagged versions of the proteins (fA1 and fA1-155). Initially, we expressed the proteins fA1 and fA1-155 by transducing the murine B cell lymphoma line WEHI 231 with recombinant retroviruses encoding these proteins. Surprisingly, levels of fA1-155 were much higher than that of fA1 (Fig. 2A, upper panel), although both populations expressed the internal ribosomal entry site-linked selection marker (a chimeric protein of EGFP and the Zeocin resistance protein) at identical levels (Fig. 2A, lower panel). One explanation for this difference could be that the full-length protein is turned over much more rapidly than the truncated version. To test this possibility, we generated a population of WEHI 231 cells co-expressing both proteins, and we analyzed their stability after inhibiting de novo protein synthesis with cycloheximide (Fig. 2B). As predicted, fA1 disappeared much more rapidly than fA1-155. The half-life of ∼15 min for the full-length protein was extended to almost 60 min for the truncated protein. To further strengthen this finding, we constructed two more mutants lacking either 12 (fA1-160) or 21 (fA1-151) amino acids at the C-terminal end, and we tested their stability in WEHI 231 cells. Indeed, the more amino acids we removed at the end of the protein, the more stable the mutant A1 proteins were (Fig. 2C). However, a mutant lacking the final 27 amino acids, including part of the BH2 domain, was not stable, possibly because it was not properly folded (data not shown). Finally, we confirmed the rapid turnover of fA1 in a pulse/chase experiment (Fig. 2D). Together, these findings indicate that A1 is a very unstable protein and that the instability is mediated by a domain located within the last 20 amino acids. By using a newly generated anti-A1 antiserum, which cross-reacts with mouse and human A1/Bfl-1, but not mouse Bcl-2 (data not shown), we were also able to determine the stability of endogenous A1 in a pulse/chase experiment. The loss of the metabolically 35S-labeled endogenous A1 followed the same time course as that of the overexpressed (unflagged) protein (Fig. 2E) thus confirming the earlier studies with FLAG-tagged A1. To ensure that the fast turnover of A1 is autonomous and not limited to WEHI 231 cells, we also transduced primary mouse splenic B cells and the human embryonic kidney cell line 293T with fA1 (Fig. 3, A and B). In both cell types, we observed a loss of fA1 after cycloheximide treatment comparable with that seen in WEHI 231 cells (Fig. 3, A and B), i.e. fA1 disappeared with a half-life of less than 30 min. The C-terminal ends of A1 and the human homolog Bfl-1 are highly conserved (Fig. 1A). Consistent with this, we observed a half-life of fBfl-1 in the human Burkitt lymphoma cell line Daudi that was comparable with the half-life of A1 (Fig. 3C). In summary, the high instability of A1 is not limited to a certain cell type and is conserved in the human A1 homolog Bfl-1. The C Terminus of A1 Regulates Its Stability—Next, we addressed the question of whether the destabilization motif also functions independently of its position within the A1 protein by fusing the last 35 amino acids of A1 to the N terminus of the stabilized A1-155 (ctA1-155). Again, the protein was retrovirally expressed in WEHI 231 cells and compared with A1- and A1-155-expressing populations containing roughly the same number of proviral integrations. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of the newly generated protein was as low as that of the wild type protein. In addition, treating the cells with cycloheximide confirmed that it was as unstable as full-length A1 (Fig. 4A). Thus, the C-terminal residues of A1 mediate rapid degradation independently of their position within the protein. To determine whether this domain could also destabilize other proteins, we generated several chimeric proteins containing the last 35 amino acids of A1. Fusing the C terminus of A1 to an enzymatically inactive mutant of caspase-3 (Casp3-A1ct) reduced its half-life compared with fusing the FLAG peptide at its C terminus (Casp3f) (Fig. 4B). Similarly, the exchange of the C terminus of Bcl-2 with that of A1 (Bcl-2-A1ct) also resulted in a reduced half-life of the chimeric protein compared with wild type Bcl-2 (Fig. 4C). Finally, we transduced WEHI 231 cells with the chimeric proteins EGFP-A1ct or EGFP-Bcl-2ct, and we measured the fluorescence of the cells by flow cytometry. Regardless of the multiplicity of infection used, cells transduced with EGFP-A1ct showed a consistently lower mean fluorescence index than those transduced with EGFP-Bcl-2ct (Fig. 4D and data not shown). This difference became even more pronounced when de novo protein synthesis was blocked with cycloheximide. Taken together, all results show that the C terminus of A1 is not only necessary but also sufficient for mediating the instability of a protein. A1 Is Degraded after Ubiquitination via the Proteasomes—It has been known for nearly 20 years that short lived proteins are degraded by proteasomes (34Melino G. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1155-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To see whether A1 is also degraded via this pathway, we analyzed the stability of fA1 and fA1-155 within the doubly transduced WEHI 231 population in the presence or absence of a proteasome inhibitor (proteasome inhibitor II). Blocking proteasomal degradation totally abolished the loss of the fA1 after inhibition of de novo protein synthesis with cycloheximide, although no change was observed in the level of the fA1-155 protein (Fig. 5A). In addition, we analyzed the protein stability of A1 after blocking the proteasomes in a pulse/chase experiment. Consistent with the cycloheximide data, A1 was almost entirely stabilized within the 2 h of observation in the presence of proteasome inhibitor II (Fig. 5B). This finding strongly suggests a proteasomal degradation pathway for A1. As we have shown, EGFP becomes very unstable when fused with the C terminus of A1 (Fig. 4D). We then asked whether the rapid turnover of this fusion protein was also because of proteasomal degradation. Indeed, flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that blocking proteasomal activity with proteasome inhibitor II efficiently stabilized EGFP-A1ct (Fig. 5C, upper panel) but had no effect on levels of the stable EGFP-Bcl-2ct (Fig. 5C, lower panel). Similar results were obtained when we used a second proteasome inhibitor (MG-115) (data not shown). Taken together, these results imply that the proteasomal degradation of A1 is mediated via the C terminus of the protein. Degradation of short lived proteins via proteasomes is frequently preceded by polyquitination of the targeted substrates (35Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2894) Google Scholar). To test whether A1 is also a substrate for polyquitination, we transiently co-transfected 293T cells with an expression construct for fA1 and a construct coding for HA-tagged ubiquitin (haUbi). After precipitation of fA1, we analyzed the precipitate for haUbi by Western blotting. fA1 was strongly polyubiquitinated, whereas co-expression of fA1-155 with haUbi only resulted in weak ubiquitination (Fig. 5D, left panel). Importantly, substitution of all 11 lysines to alanine (A1(11A)) totally inhibited the conjugation of haUbi to A1 (Fig. 5D, right panel). In summary, these results suggest that A1 is first polyubiquitinated and then proteasomally degraded with the longer half-life of fA1-155 explained by its reduced ubiquitination. It is known that the ubiquitin protein is covalently linked to lysine residues in the target protein by so-called E ligases and that mutation of these residues in short lived proteins usually increases the stability of the protein (35Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2894) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the mutation of all four lysine residues in the C terminus of A1 has an impact on its stability. We overexpressed the corresponding lysine to arginine mutant (fA1(4R)) in WEHI 231 cells. Most unexpectedly, we did not observe a substantial increase in the half-life of fA1(4R) compared with the fA1 (Fig. 6A). This was not because of structural modifications introduced by the arginine substitution, as replacing the four lysine residues with alanine also had no influence on the half-life of the A1 protein (data not shown). We also mutated the four lysine residues in the C terminus of the chimeric proteins fBcl-2-A1ct and fCasp3-A1ct to arginines (fBcl-2-A1ct(4R) and fCasp3-A1ct(4R), respectively). Consistent with the lysine mutant of A1, neither fBcl-2-A1ct(4R) (Fig. 6B) nor fCasp3-A1(4R) (data not shown) showed any significant change in their stability. Finally, we compared the level of polyubiquitination of fCasp3-A1ct and fCasp3-A1ct(4R) in 293T cells co-expressing haUbi (Fig. 6C). In line with the comparable instability of the two proteins, we did not observe a significant difference in polyubiquitination. These results indicate that the lysine residues in the C terminus of A1 are not necessary for the degradation of A1. Furthermore, these results suggest that the C terminus of A1 might serve as a docking site for E3 ligases to allow the assembly of polyubiquitin chains at “distant” lysine residues within the target proteins. Bim Stabilizes A1 by Reducing Its Ubiquitination—BH3-only proteins can bind to A1 (25Werner A.B. de Vries E. Tait S.W. Bontjer I. Borst J. J. Biol.

As both A1 and BimEL serve important functions in immune cells, we wondered whether BimEL has any influence on polyubiquitination and/or the fast turnover rate of A1 (19Lin E.Y. Orlofsky A. Berger M.S. Prystowsky M.B. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1979-1988PubMed Google Scholar, 36Strasser A. Puthalakath H. Bouillet P. Huang D.C. O'Connor L. O'Reilly L.A. Cullen L. Cory S. Adams J.M. Ann. N.

Although Jac1p as well as its specialized Hsp70 partner, Ssq1p, binds directly to the Fe-S cluster scaffold protein Isu, the Jac1p-Isu1p interaction is not well understood. Here we report that a C-terminal fragment of Jac1p lacking its J-domain is sufficient for interaction with Isu1p, and amino acid alterations in this domain affect interaction with Isu1p but not Ssq1p. In vivo, such JAC1 mutations had no obvious phenotypic effect.

Our in vivo and in vitro results indicate that independent interaction of Jac1p and the Isu client protein with Hsp70 is sufficient for robust growth under standard laboratory conditions. However, our results also support the idea that Isu protein can be “targeted” to Ssq1p after forming a complex with Jac1p.

Biogenesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, prosthetic groups required for the function of a variety of proteins involved in redox reactions, catalysis, and environmental sensing, is an intricate, highly conserved process. Eukaryotes utilize proteins homologous to those encoded in the bacterial iron-sulfur cluster assembly operon with Fe-S clusters being formed on a highly conserved scaffold protein, called Isu in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and subsequently transferred to a recipient apoprotein (1Lill R. Muhlenhoff U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 133-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 2Johnson D.C. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev.

The specialized mitochondrial J-protein, Jac1p, and its Hsp70 partner, Ssq1p, are also crucial components of the yeast system with Isu protein being the only known substrate of this chaperone system (4Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B. Knieszner H. Walter W. Craig E.A. Marszalek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29719-29727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Similarly, in bacteria, IscU, the ortholog of Isu1p, is the only known substrate for the specialized chaperone pair, HscB (J-protein) and HscA (Hsp70) (5Silberg J. Hoff K. Tapley T. Vickery L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1696-1700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).Although Jac1p is highly specialized, it shares many properties with other J-proteins. All contain a conserved ∼70-amino acid sequence known as the J-domain, which is named for the canonical member of this group DnaJ from Escherichia coli. The universal function of J-domains is stimulation of the ATPase activity of Hsp70s, an activity that requires a conserved histidine:proline:aspartic acid (HPD) tripeptide and results in stabilization of an interaction between an Hsp70 and its client protein. Such activity is critical for Jac1p function, as alteration of HPD to three alanines (AAA) profoundly affects the ability of Jac1p to stimulate Ssq1p ATPase activity and to rescue the lethal effects of the absence of Jac1p in vivo (6Voisine C. Cheng Y.C. Ohlson M. Schilke B. Hoff K. Beinert H. Marszalek J. Craig E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1483-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 7Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B.

When ATP is bound to an Hsp70, substrate protein binding and release occur very rapidly. Upon hydrolysis of ATP to ADP, Hsp70 undergoes a conformational change that slows release of the substrate protein (8Bukau B. Horwich A.L.

Under physiological conditions, ATP concentrations are high, and Hsp70 bound to ATP is the biologically relevant form, ensuring rapid interaction with substrate proteins. ATPase activity, which is critical for stabilization of the Hsp70-substrate interaction, is stimulated by both interaction of the client protein in the substrate binding cleft and J-protein interaction. In addition to their stimulatory role, some J-proteins (e.g. DnaJ and Jac1p) also bind substrate proteins directly, and thus it has been suggested that they might “target” them to Hsp70 (9Wawrzynow A.

However, the physiological importance of this mechanism for proper function of Hsp70 has not been tested.Although it is clear that Isu1p is a substrate of the Ssq1p-Jac1p chaperone system, the exact function of the chaperones in the process of Fe-S cluster biogenesis is still under debate. Current evidence from S. cerevisiae suggests that the chaperones are important in transferring the iron-sulfur cluster from Isu1p to an aporecipient protein rather than assembling the cluster on Isu1p (14Muhlenhoff U. Gerber J. Richhardt N. Lill R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4815-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 15Dutkiewicz R. Marszalek J. Schilke B. Craig E.A. Lill R. Muehlenhoff U. J. Biol.

However, to understand the mechanism of chaperone involvement in Fe-S cluster biogenesis, it is crucial to understand how the chaperones interact with Isu1p and the importance of this interaction in vivo. It is established that Ssq1p interacts with a specific peptide sequence on Isu1p, proline, valine, lysine (PVK) (7Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B. Cheng S. Knieszner H. Craig E.A. Marszalek J. J. Biol.

However, very little is known about how Jac1p or its bacterial ortholog HscB interacts with the Isu/IscU protein scaffold. The structure of HscB, which has been determined by x-ray crystallography, consists of a 75-amino acid N-terminal J-domain and an 83-amino acid C-terminal domain composed of a three-helix bundle (19Cupp-Vickery J.R. Vickery L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).No experimental information was available concerning which residues of Jac1p are important for scaffold binding or whether such binding is important in vivo. Therefore, we set out to obtain a JAC1 mutant encoding a protein defective in interaction with Isu1p and to determine the in vivo effect of the decreased interaction. We found that a conserved patch of residues in the C-terminal domain of Jac1p is directly involved in Isu1p binding, as replacement of several such residues by alanines resulted in reduced affinity for Isu1p. Surprisingly, under normal growth conditions this JAC1 mutant did not display a growth phenotype. However, when combined with an SSQ1 mutation causing reduced affinity of Ssq1p for Isu1p, growth was defective even at optimal temperatures, suggesting that Isu1p targeting by Jac1p can facilitate Ssq1p-Isu1p interaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains, Plasmids, Media, and Chemicals—Strains of S. cerevisiae used in this study were derived from PJ53, which is isogenic to W303: trp1–1/trp1–1 ura3–1/ura3–1 leu2–3,112/leu2–3,112 his3–11,15/his3–11,15 ade2–1/ade2–1 can1–100/can1–100 GAL2+/GAL2+ met2-Δ1/met2-Δ1 lys2-Δ2/lys2-Δ2. Strains designated as wild type are trp1–1 ura3–1 leu2–3,112 his3–11,15 ade2–1 can1–100 GAL2+ met2-Δ1 lys2-Δ2 jac1::ADE2 and contain pRS314-Jac. JAC1 mutants were constructed by changing selected codons to encode alanine by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange protocol, Stratagene) using wild type JAC1 (–350 to +824) cloned into pRS314 (20Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a template that has TRP1 as a marker. In addition to the mutants discussed in the text, K125A/K129A, K132A/Q136A, C145A, K125A/K129A/K132A/Q136A, D120A/E121A, N147A/D148A, K162A/Y163A, L104A/K107A/D113A/Q117A, K125A/K129A/K132A/Q136A/L104A/K107A, K125A/K129A/K132A/K136A/D113A/Q117A, K162A/Y163A, D110A/D113A/E114A/Q117A, L104A/K107A/D110A/E114A, T98A/T99A/S100A, I135A/I147A, and D110A/D113A were constructed and analyzed. None of these mutants displayed a growth phenotype under the conditions tested. Plasmids containing mutant JAC1 were transformed into the heterozygous diploid (JAC1/jac1::ADE2), and tetrads were analyzed for the desired progeny. For overexpression studies, jac1(LKDDEQ) and JAC1 were subcloned to the HIS3 marked 2μ vector pRS423 (21Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene. 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar).To assess the genetic interactions between ssq1(V472F) and jac1-(LKDDEQ), the ssq1(V472F) strain was crossed to the Δjac1 + pRS316-Jac-His strain. Haploid ssq1(V472F) Δjac1 + pRS316-Jac-His progeny from this diploid were then crossed to ssq1(V472F) to yield a diploid ssq1(V472F)/ssq1(V472F) Δjac1/JAC1 + pRS316-Jac-His. Wild type JAC1 and jac1(LKDDEQ) were transformed into this strain followed by sporulation to obtain the strains indicated in the text. To assess genetic interactions between SSC1 and jac1(LKDDEQ), JAC1 on 2μ vectors was transformed into Δssq1/SSQ1 Δjac1/JAC1 and the desired strains obtained upon tetrad dissection. An empty ADE2 vector was transformed into Δssq1/SSQ1 to yield a Δssq1 strain that was Ade2+ to ensure that any growth defects observed were not because of the presence of the ade2 mutation in some strains. Yeast were grown on YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) or on synthetic media as described (22Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics.

All chemicals, unless stated otherwise, were purchased from Sigma.Purification of Proteins—In all cases, protein concentrations, determined by using the Bradford (Bio-Rad) assay system with bovine serum albumin as a standard, are expressed as the concentration of monomers. Recombinant Mge1pHis (23Horst M. Oppliger W. Rospert S. Schonfeld H.-J. Schatz G. Azem A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), Isu1pHis, and Ssq1pHis, the wild type and mutant proteins, were purified as described previously (4Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B.

To construct a plasmid for expression of Isu1pStrep having a Strep-tag (24Skerra A. Schmidt T.G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 326: 271-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at the C terminus of the mature protein, a pET3a-Strep-tag vector was made by cloning the Strep-tag in as a linker using primers Strep-F 5′-gatcctggagccacccgcagttcgaaaaat-3′ and Strep-R 5′-gatcatttttcgaactgcgggtggctccag-3′, which allowed insertion of Strep-tag II (WSHPQFEK) into the BamHI site of pET3a, maintaining the 5′-BamHI but not the 3′-BamHI site. DNA encoding mature Isu1p (amino acids 37–165) was then cloned as an NdeI-BamHI fragment into the pET3a-Strep-tag to create pET3a-Isu-Strep-tag. To construct an expression vector for purification of the C terminus of Jac1p from E. coli, the C-terminal region from amino acids 71–184 with six histidine codons at the 3′-end were amplified by PCR to construct plasmid pET21d-Jac(71–184).Expression of Isu1pStrep was induced in the E. coli strain C41 (25Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1556) Google Scholar) by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at A600 = 0.6. After 3 h of growth at 30 °C, cells were harvested and lysed in a French press set to 15,000 p.s.i. in buffer L (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 500 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100). The supernatant was loaded onto a Strep-Tacin column (IBA) equilibrated with buffer L. The column was washed with 15 column volumes of buffer L, eluted with buffer L with 2.5 mm desthiobiotin, and dialyzed against buffer K (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100, 200 mm KCl).Jac1pHis mutant proteins were purified according to the original protocol or by modifying the original protocol to a batch procedure (6Voisine C. Cheng Y.C. Ohlson M. Schilke B. Hoff K. Beinert H. Marszalek J. Craig E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1483-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Proteins were eluted from a column with a 30–300 mm gradient of imidazole in buffer NI (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) or in the case of the batch purification with a step elution in buffer E (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 200 mm imidazole). Fractions containing protein were then dialyzed to buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm KCl).Expression of the C terminus of Jac1p (Jac(71–184)) was induced in the E. coli strain C41 (25Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1556) Google Scholar) by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at A600 = 0.6. After 3 h of growth at 30 °C, cell were harvested and lysed in a French press set to 16,000 p.s.i. After a clarifying spin, the supernatant was loaded on 2.5 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose at 4 °C, and after washing with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 30 mm imidazole; 40 column volumes), protein was eluted by a 30–300 mm linear imidazole gradient in buffer NI (30 ml at 0.4 ml/min). Fractions containing Jac(71–184) were collected and dialyzed overnight in buffer B, then loaded on a Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with buffer B. After washing with 10 volumes of buffer B, protein was eluted with linear gradient of 50–300 mm NaCl in buffer B (40 ml at 0.3 ml/min). Fractions containing Jac(71–184) were dialyzed for 4 h against buffer B, then loaded on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column at 4 °C (0.5 ml equilibrated with buffer B). Protein was eluted with buffer B containing 500 mm imidazole. Protein was dialyzed against buffer B and stored at –70 °C.Pulldown Experiments—Single concentration and titration pulldowns were performed by incubating indicated concentrations of Isu1pStrep and Jac1pHis in 150 μl of buffer LP for 30 min at room temperature (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 125 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm imidazole). Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads were equilibrated with buffer LP and incubated with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. 20 μl of beads were added to each reaction and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with rotation. The protein bound to the beads was washed five times with 500 μl of buffer LP. After the final wash, sample buffer was added to the reaction mixtures, and after a short spin all the supernatant was loaded on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained using Coomassie Blue or Sypro-Ruby (Molecular Probes) and quantified by densitometry analysis. No differences in results were observed when experiments were performed in the presence and absence of dithiothreitol. All interaction assays were performed with apoIsu1p.Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Analysis—SPR 3The abbreviations used are: SPR, surface plasmon resonance; MS, maximal stimulation; C0.5, concentration giving half-maximal stimulation. studies were carried out at 25 °C with a Biacore 2000 instrument (Piscataway, NJ). Peptide P-PVK (LSLPPVKLHC) was cross-linked to the surface of the sensor chip CM5 by thiol coupling as recommended by the manufacturer. Purified Isu1 protein was randomly cross-linked to the surface of the sensor chip CM5 by amine coupling as recommended by the manufacturer. Binding experiments were conducted in buffer R (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, 11 mm MgCl2, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20 (Amersham Biosciences)) with the running buffer at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. 60 μl of buffer R containing purified Jac1p and other components as indicated were used for injections.Circular Dichroism (CD)—Measurements were performed on an Aviv 62A DS circular dichroism spectrometer from 194 to 260 nm with 5-s averaging times and 1-nm step size at 25 °C. The protein concentration was 5 μm in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 80 mm KCl in a quartz cuvette with 1-mm path length. Spectra were measured in millidegrees, corrected for buffer effects, and converted to mean residue ellipticity ( (⊖)).Other Techniques—Steady state ATPase assays were carried out as described previously (4Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B. Knieszner H. Walter W. Craig E.A. Marszalek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29719-29727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In the ATP assays, release of radioactive inorganic phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP was measured. Control reactions lacking protein were included in all experiments. Glycerol gradient centrifugation was conducted as described in Ref. 4Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B. Knieszner H. Walter W. Craig E.A. Marszalek J. J. Biol.

To test the prediction that the C-terminal region is sufficient for interaction with Isu1p, we purified a Jac1p truncation retaining amino acids 71–184 of the mature protein and assessed its ability to interact with Isu1p using glycerol gradient centrifugation and staining of the resulting fractions, a technique that has previously been used to analyze the interaction of Isu1p with full-length Jac1p (4Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B. Knieszner H. Walter W. Craig E.A. Marszalek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29719-29727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Upon centrifugation, the C terminus of Jac1p alone or Isu1p alone peaked in the seventh fraction. When mixed together prior to centrifugation, protein migrated further into the gradient, peaking in fraction 9, consistent with interaction of the Jac1p C terminus with Isu1p (Fig. 1). Because the two proteins co-migrate, immunoblot analysis was used to confirm a shift in migration of both Isu1p and Jac1p (data not shown). We conclude that the C terminus of Jac1p is sufficient for interaction with Isu1p.Alterations in the C-terminal Domain of Jac1p Affect Isu1p Binding—To begin to identify the residues of the C terminus of Jac1p that are important for binding to Isu1p, alignments were made between the C terminus of Jac1p and HscB, the E. coli ortholog, the structure of which has been solved by x-ray crystallography (19Cupp-Vickery J.R. Vickery L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The 84-amino acid C termini, consisting of only the three α-helices, are 57% similar sharing 15 identical residues (Fig. 2A). We changed residues predicted to be on the surface of Jac1p to alanines, focusing on those conserved between HscB and Jac1p as well as charged residues, regardless of their conservation. In total, 22 residues were changed, initially in pairs (Fig. 2A, bold residues).FIGURE 2Identification of a region of Jac1p important for binding Isu1p. A, alignment of HscB and Jac1p C termini generated by SWISS-MODEL (33Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4416) Google Scholar). Conserved residues, as determined by ClustalX (30Hall B.G. Phylogenetic Trees Made Easy. 2nd. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2004: 9-60Google Scholar), are indicated: identical (*), strong conservation (:), and weak similarity (.).

The structure was prepared using Protein Explorer software. C, Δjac1 cells harboring plasmid-borne copies of wild type (WT) JAC1 and mutant JAC1 were plated on glucose-rich medium. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2 days.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)JAC1 is an essential gene. Therefore, to test the function of each mutant protein, a plasmid carrying a mutant JAC1 was transformed individually into a heterozygous Δjac1/JAC1 diploid strain and the growth of the haploid progeny expressing only the mutant Jac1p that resulted from tetrad dissection analyzed. All JAC1 mutants had a wild type phenotype under a variety of growth conditions (Fig. 2C, data not shown). We then concentrated more thoroughly on a region of Jac1p predicted to have a cluster of conserved residues on the surface, L104A, K107A, D110A, D113A, E114A, Q117A (Fig. 2B), combining all six mutations in a single copy of the JAC1 gene. jac1(LKDDEQ) had a wild type phenotype (Fig. 2C).The lack of phenotypes of the mutants suggested to us that either the interaction with Isu1p was not disrupted or was not required in vivo under normal conditions. We then focused on the Jac1p(LKDDEQ) having 6-amino acid alterations. Wild type Jac1p and Jac1p(LKDDEQ), both having a His tag, were purified and their ability to interact with Isu1p compared. We first used glycerol gradient centrifugation. As the peaks representing Jac1p(LKDDEQ) and Isu1p did not shift when the two proteins were mixed (data not shown), we concluded that mutant Jac1p was defective in interacting with Isu1p. However, because of technical limitations of the centrifugation assay we were unable to test a variety of concentrations and thus assess the degree to which the affinity of the interaction was affected. Therefore, we developed a pulldown assay. Different concentrations of Jac1p were incubated with 2.5 μm Isu1p to allow complex formation. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin was then used to pull down Jac1p and any Isu1p bound to it, and protein was detected by staining after separation by SDS-PAGE. Binding of wild type Jac1p was saturable with an apparent Kd of ∼2 μm (Fig. 3A, left panel). Jac1p(LKDDEQ) interacted with Isu1p less well than wild type protein, with only 25% as much binding as wild type observed at the highest concentration, 10 μm. Binding was not saturable at the concentrations tested.FIGURE 3Binding of LKDDEQ to Isu1p and stimulation of Ssq1p ATPase activity. A, left panel, Isu1p (2.5μm) and Jac1p wild type (squares) or LKDDEQ (triangles) with concentration as indicated was preincubated to allow complex formation. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads were added to pull down the complex. Bound Isu1p was quantitated by densitometry. The amount of Isu1p pulled down by 10 μm Jac1p wild type (WT) was set as 1. Values were plotted in Prism using a single binding hyperbola to fit data obtained for wild type Jac1p (Kd = 2.044 ± 0.969) and linear regression to fit Jac1p(LKDDEQ) data. Right panel, interaction of Isu1p (5μm) and Jac1p wild type, LK, DE, DQ, or LKDDEQ (5μm) was analyzed as described for the left panel. The amount of Isu1p interacting with Jac1p wild type was set to 100%. Error bars represent the standard deviation of six independent experiments. B, left panel, CD spectra measured for purified Jac1p wild type (triangles) and Jac1p(LKDDEQ) (squares) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, right panel, Ssq1p ATPase activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Reaction mixtures contained 0.8 μm Ssq1p, 16 μm Isu1p, 0.8 μm Mge1p, and Jac1p wild type (open circles) or LKDDEQ (filled circles) as indicated. ATPase activity measured in the absence of Jac1p was set to 0. Evaluation of the data according to the Michaelis-Menten equation yielded the following parameters: wild type, maximal stimulation (MS) = 6.99 (±0.44), C0.5 = 0.14 (±0.03); LKDDEQ, MS = 7.01 (±0.50), C0.5 = 0.26 (±0.06).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the observed defect could be attributed to a specific residue, assays were conducted using mutant JAC1 proteins having combinations of two alterations within the Jac1p(LKDDEQ) motif. Equimolar concentrations of Jac1p and Isu1p were used. Jac1p(LKDDEQ) pulled down 20% as much Isu1p as wild type Jac1p (Fig. 3A, right panel). None of the mutant proteins containing two alterations were as defective in interacting with Isu1p as Jac1p(LKDDEQ), as all of the mutant proteins pulled down between 40 and 60% as much Isu1p as wild type (Fig. 3A, right panel). Because these results were consistent with the defect in interaction with Isu1p being attributable to at least 3-amino acid changes, we focused on Jac1p(LKDDEQ) in subsequent analyses.Jac1p(LKDDEQ) Is Not Defective in Stimulation of Ssq1p ATPase Activity—The results described above indicate that Jac1p(LKDDEQ) is defective in interaction with Isu1p. To evaluate whether this decrease in Isu1p binding is a specific defect or because of general misfolding of the purified mutant protein, we carried out two experiments. First, CD spectra were obtained. The CD spectra of wild type Jac1p and Jac1p(LKDDEQ) were indistinguishable, indicating the differences observed in binding were not the result of global misfolding (Fig. 3B, left panel). Second, as a measure of the activity of the J-domains, we compared the ability of wild type Jac1p and Jac1p(LKDDEQ) to stimulate Ssq1p ATPase activity at"

Here the detailed analysis of the composition and the functional state of the light harvesting antennae of both photosystem I and II of these plants is presented. Two new populations of trimers were found, both functional in energy transfer to the PSII reaction center, a homotrimer of CP26 and a heterotrimer of CP26 and Lhcb3. These trimers possess characteristic features thought to be specific for the native LHCIIb trimers they are replacing: the long wavelength form of lutein and at least one extra chlorophyll b, but they were less stable. A new population of loosely bound LHCI was also found, contributing to an increased antenna size for photosystem I, which may in part compensate for the loss of the phosphorylated LHCIIb that can associate with this photosystem. Thus, the loss of LHCIIb has triggered concerted compensatory responses in the composition of antennae of both photosystems. These responses clearly show the importance of LHCIIb in the structure and assembly of the photosynthetic membrane and illustrate the extreme plasticity at the level of the composition of the light harvesting system.

Thus, the loss of LHCIIb has triggered concerted compensatory responses in the composition of antennae of both photosystems. These responses clearly show the importance of LHCIIb in the structure and assembly of the photosynthetic membrane and illustrate the extreme plasticity at the level of the composition of the light harvesting system. The light harvesting antenna of higher plants displays a highly conserved complexity in terms of genetic make-up, protein composition, oligomerization, and macrostructure that is mostly poorly understood (1Jansson S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). In the case of PSII there are at least six different polypeptides that are assembled into a mixture of monomeric and trimeric chl a/b 2The abbreviations used are: chl, chlorophyll; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; α-DM, n-dodecyl α-d-maltoside; β-DM, n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside; IEF, isoelectric focusing; wt, wild type. xanthophyll protein complexes, collectively referred to as LHCII. The major complex, LHCIIb is composed of three types of polypeptides, products of the Lhcb1, 2, and 3 genes. The Lhcb1 and 2 are the dominating proteins. The minor complexes, CP29, CP26, and CP24, consist of the Lhcb4, Lhcb5, and Lhcb6 polypeptides and contain ∼15% of PSII chlorophyll. LHCIIb carries up to 60% of the pigments of the PSII antenna (2Kuhlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 3Liu Z. Yan M. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gui L. An X. Chang W. Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar), with efficient energy transfer between chls and with a long chl singlet state excitation lifetime (4van Amerongen H. van Grondelle R. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2001; 105: 604-617Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 5Novoderezhkin V.I. Palacios M.A. van Amerongen H. van Grondelle R. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2005; 109: 10493-10504Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar); this provides a large and highly efficient light harvesting system. LHCIIb is also involved in a crucial low light adaptation strategy of plants, the state transitions, which control the relative PSI and PSII cross-sections (6Haldrup A. Jensen P.E. Lunde C. Scheller H.V. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 301-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Equally, under light stress, excess light energy in LHCIIb can be safely dissipated into heat, an important photoprotective process, nonphotochemical quenching (7Horton P. Ruban A.V. Walters R.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 655-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). The ability of LHCIIb to exist in different conformations with a range of excited state lifetimes seems to be an important aspect of this latter process (8Moya I. Silvestri M. Vallon O. Cinque G. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12552-12561Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 9Pascal A.A. Liu Z. Broess K. van Oort B. van Amerongen H. Wang C. Horton P. Robert B. Chang W. Ruban A.V. Nature. 2005; 436: 134-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The native LHCIIb state is a trimer of monomeric pigment-protein complexes. These trimers possess certain unexplained characteristics not found in monomers (e.g. extra chl b, a long wavelength lutein, bound phospholipid). On the other hand, the minor LHCII components, CP26, CP24, and CP29, are always monomeric. Trimeric LHCIIb and the monomeric complexes are associated with the dimeric PSII core to form the LHCII-PSII supercomplexes found in the granal membranes of the chloroplast (10Dekker J.P. Boekema E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1706: 12-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). The role of the trimeric state or indeed of the highly conserved macromolecular organization of the entire granum is not understood, despite the recent advances in structure determination (3Liu Z. Yan M. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gui L. An X. Chang W. Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar, 10Dekker J.P. Boekema E.J. Biochim. Biophys.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Genetic manipulation of the levels of specific pigments and polypeptides is proving a powerful approach to understanding the structure and function of the photosynthetic antennae (12Ganeteg U. Strand Å. Gustaffson P. Jansson S. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 13Andersson J. Walters R.G. Horton P. Jansson S. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 14Davison P. Hunter C.N. Horton P. Nature. 2002; 418: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 15Yakushevska A.E. Keegstra W. Boekema E.J. Dekker J.P. Jansson S. Horton P. Ruban A.V. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Lhcb2 antisense Arabidopsis thaliana plants have been constructed by introducing the Lhcb2.1 coding region in the antisense orientation into the plant genome (16Andersson J. Wentworth M. Walters R.G. Howard C. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Jansson S. Plant J. 2003; 35: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This resulted in not only the complete absence of Lhcb2 but also Lhcb1 polypeptides. These plants, despite having a pale green appearance, were able to develop, grow, and produce seeds. Photosynthetic quantum yield was only slightly reduced, and despite the absence of the key LHCII polypeptides, chloroplasts of antisense plants possess grana. However, the vital adaptive functions of the photosynthetic membrane where LHCIIb plays a key role were found to be significantly inhibited (16Andersson J. Wentworth M. Walters R.G. Howard C. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Jansson S. Plant J. 2003; 35: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar); the state transitions were completely absent in the antisense plants, and nonphotochemical chlorophyll fluorescence quenching was reduced by over 30%. Remarkably, despite the absence of LHCIIb, trimeric structures were still found in the antenna, and photosystem II retained its characteristic macro-organization, the supercomplex structure being virtually indistinguishable from that of the wild type (17Ruban A.V. Wentworth M. Yakushevska A.E. Andersson J. Lee P.J. Keegstra W. Dekker J.P. Boekema E.J. Jansson S. Horton P. Nature. 2003; 421: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis showed that the levels of other antenna proteins increase in the antisense plants, and we suggested that the trimers are composed of the greatly increased amounts of Lhcb5, which is normally only found in the monomeric CP26 complex. These observations led to the hypothesis that the increases in expression of other light harvesting genes may be compensatory changes that allow the thylakoid membrane structure to be preserved and photosynthetic performance to be maintained. The oligomeric structure of the antenna, particularly LHCIIb trimerization, is therefore seen as a key feature of the molecular design of the functional thylakoid membrane. If this hypothesis is correct, these responses indicate the presence of a remarkable level of plasticity and robustness, which must result from a complex response of the altered LHC genome in the form of interplay between the expression of both Lhcb and Lhca genes and in the processes of assembly of supramolecular structure. Therefore, the aim of the current work was to test this hypothesis, first by carrying out a systematic analysis of the composition of the light harvesting antenna in the antisense plants and second by determination of the functional competence of the new proteins. The data obtained also allowed us to assess the effectiveness of the compensatory response of the whole antenna system and to address the question of the reason for the trimeric LHCIIb structure and the molecular bases of its assembly and its specific characteristic properties. Lhcb2 antisense plants (asLhcb2), line asLhcb2-12, were derived from Arabidopsis thaliana, cv Columbia as previously described (16Andersson J. Wentworth M. Walters R.G. Howard C. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Jansson S. Plant J. 2003; 35: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Seed was obtained by self-pollination for several successive generations. Wild type (wt) and antisense plants were grown for 8-9 weeks in plant growth rooms with an 8-h photoperiod with a light intensity of 200 μmol quanta m-2 s-1 and at a day/night temperatures of 22/15 °C. Thylakoids were prepared by homogenizing fresh tissue in ice-cold grinding medium (330 mm sorbitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Na4P2O7, pH 6.5, 2 mm iso-ascorbate) with a polytron. The homogenate was then filtered through four layers of muslin followed by two layers of muslin and one layer of cotton wool. The filtrate was centrifuged for 10 min at 5,000 × g, and the chloroplast-enriched pellet was resuspended in wash buffer (330 mm sorbitol, 10 mm MES, pH 6.5), followed by a further 10-min centrifugation at 5,000 × g. The pellet was then resuspended in 5 mm MgCl2 for 30 s to lyse any remaining intact chloroplasts, followed by an equal volume of osmoticum (660 mm sorbitol, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 100 mm HEPES, pH 6.5). After further centrifugation, thylakoids were resuspended in 20 mm Bis-Tris (pH 6.5), 5 mm MgCl2. The composition of carotenoids was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography as described by Ruban et al. (18Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Pascal A.A. Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) with the modifications described by Andersson et al. (13Andersson J. Walters R.G. Horton P. Jansson S. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Chlorophyll content was obtained using the method of Porra et al. (19Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4743) Google Scholar). Low temperature spectroscopy was performed using an OptistatDN LN-2 cooled bath cryostat (Oxford Instruments). The samples were diluted in a medium containing 70% glycerol (w/v), 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.33 m sorbitol. The chlorophyll concentration for absorption was 4 μm, and for the fluorescence and fluorescence excitation measurements was 1 μm. Polymethyl methacrylate 1-cm cuvettes were used for all of the experiments. The temperature of the sample was monitored with a thermocouple sensor (Comark) immersed directly into the sample. Absorption measurements were performed using a Cary 500 UV-visible Nir spectrophotometer (Varian) modified to adopt the cryostat. The spectral resolution was 1 nm with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10000. The reduced single spectral beam mode was employed to focus the measuring beam on the sample only and to obtain the maximum light output. The spectra were corrected for the cuvette and buffer medium absorption using Gramms/32 software (Galactic Industries Corporation). Fluorescence emission and excitation spectra were recorded using a SPEX FluoroLog FL3-22 spectrofluorimeter (SPEX Industries Inc.). The excitation light was provided from a Xenon light source. In fluorescence emission measurements excitation was defined at 435 nm with a 5-nm spectral bandwidth. The fluorescence spectral resolution was 1 nm. In fluorescence excitation measurements fluorescence was detected at 685 nm with a 5-nm spectral bandwidth. The excitation spectral resolution was 1 nm. The spectra were automatically corrected for the spectral distribution of the exciting light during data acquisition. For FPLC analysis, thylakoid samples were diluted to a final chl concentration of 1.5 mg ml-1 and solubilized by the addition of n-dodecyl α-d-maltoside to a final concentration of 0.85%. The samples were vortexed thoroughly for 1 min and centrifuged for 1 min at 16,000 × g. The supernatant was then filtered through a 0.45-μm nylon filter and subjected to gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column in an Amersham Biosciences ΔKTA purifier system using the same buffer and similar conditions as previously described (15Yakushevska A.E. Keegstra W. Boekema E.J. Dekker J.P. Jansson S. Horton P. Ruban A.V. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 17Ruban A.V. Wentworth M. Yakushevska A.E. Andersson J. Lee P.J. Keegstra W. Dekker J.P. Boekema E.J. Jansson S. Horton P. Nature. 2003; 421: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For sucrose gradient separation, unstacked thylakoids were treated with 1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside with a ratio of β-DM/chl of 10 on ice for 30 min. Sucrose gradients were seven-step exponential gradients from 0.15 to 1.0 m sucrose dissolved in 20 mm HEPES buffer containing 20 mm β-DM. The run time was 18 h at 200,000 × g in a SW41 rotor at 4 °C. LHCI was prepared according to the method of Croce et al. (20Croce R. Zucchelli G. Garlaschi F. Jennings R.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17355-17360Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To separate LHCII components by nondenaturing isoelectric focusing (IEF), a procedure modified from that described before (18Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Pascal A.A. Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 21Dainese P. Hoyer-Hansen G. Bassi R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1990; 51: 693-703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used with an Amersham Biosciences Multiphor II electrophoresis system protocol. A slurry of volume 100 ml containing 4% Ultradex (Amersham Biosciences), 2% ampholine carrier ampholites (pH 3.5-5.0), 1% glycine, and 0.06% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (Sigma) was prepared and poured into the 24.5 × 11.0-cm tray to form a homogeneous layer. After carefully removing air bubbles, the tray was placed 70 cm below a small fan on a balance to allow the monitoring of the weight of evaporated water; 30 g of water was evaporated in ∼2 h. Freshly prepared PSII particles or unstacked thylakoids with a total chl concentration of 2.5 mg/ml were resuspended in 1 ml of deionized water, and 0.5 ml of 3% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside was added on ice. Incubation with occasional stirring lasted for 30 min. The samples were centrifuged at 35,000 × g, and the supernatants were applied 2 cm from the cathode of the pre-cooled and prefocused gel (1 h of prefocusing at 8 W) using a sample applicator (10 × 2 cm). After the samples had been applied, the gel was allowed to equilibrate for 3 min before the start of focusing. The focusing procedure was carried out for 18 h at a constant power of 8 W at 4 °C. The initial and final current values were normally ∼15 and 5 mA, respectively. After measuring pH values, each green band was carefully collected using a spatula and eluted using columns with a minimum volume of a solution containing 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.6) and 0.01% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside. For electrophoresis and Western blot analysis, the protein samples were solubilized and separated by 15% denaturing SDS-PAGE. Roughly equal amounts of chlorophyll were loaded, ∼2 μg/lane for PSII membranes and 0.5 μg for isolated supercomplexes and trimers. The proteins were transferred to Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences) in a Mini-Trans-Blot transfer cell (Bio-Rad) at 30 mA for 12 h. The membranes were detected with specific antibodies against the proteins Lhcb1-Lhcb6. The primary antibody was detected by a horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody using an ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences). Chemiluminescence was detected on Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences) photographic film. For the antibodies against Lhcb1, Lhcb2, and Lhcb5, linear densitometric responses were found in the range of 0.5-10 μg of chl/lane for PSII membranes. For quantification of PSI, 1 μg of chl was separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed as described by Andersson et al. (13Andersson J. Walters R.G. Horton P. Jansson S. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). PsaD and Lhca proteins were measured by densitometry of the immunoblots. Total RNA was prepared from six-week-old plants as described in Ganeteg et al. (22Ganeteg U. Klimmek F. Jansson S. Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 54: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For Lhca4, the same primers as in Ganeteg et al. (22Ganeteg U. Klimmek F. Jansson S. Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 54: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) were used, whereas for Lhcb5 the following primers were used: b5Fw, 5′-GGAGCAGCTGGTTTCATCATTCCTG, and b5Rv, 5′-GAGAACAACCTCAGCAACTACGGCG. The primers were constructed so that the amplicon spanned an intron. cDNA was synthesized from 150 ng of RNA using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences). Quantum RNA 18 S internal standards (Ambion, Austin, TX) were used. The linear range of the primers and the optimal ratio of 18 S:primers:competimers were determined, as recommended by the vendor. PCRs were performed using Amplitaq Taq polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Both the cDNA synthesis and the PCRs were performed in triplicate, giving a total of nine reactions. For microarray analysis, total RNA (1 μg) from three separately grown batches of wild type (WT1-3) and asLhcb2 (asLhcb21-3) plants was amplified as described by Allemeersch et al. (23Allemeersch J. Durinck S. Vanderhaeghen R. Alard P. Maes R. Seeuws K. Bogaert T. Coddens K. Deschouwer K. Van Hummelen P. Vuylsteke M. Moreau Y. Kwekkeboom J. Wijfjes A.H. May S. Beynon J. Hilson P. Kuiper M.T. Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 588-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), using the MessageAmp II aRNA kit (Ambion). cDNA synthesis, labeling, microarray hybridization, and scanning were performed according to Sjödin et al. (24Sjödin A. Bylesjö M. Skogström O. Eriksson D. Nilsson P. Rydén P. Jansson S. Karlsson J. UPSC-BASE. 2005; (Populus transcriptomics on-line)Google Scholar) and stored in the public data base UPSC-BASE (www.upscbase.umu.se) as experiment number UMA-0061. Statistical analysis was conducted using UPSC-BASE and was based on three dye swaps (i.e. six microarrays). The raw data were transformed (25Dudley A.M. Aach J. Steffen M.A. Church G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7554-7559Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and print tip loss was normalized (26Smyth G.K. Speed T. Methods. 2003; 31: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar) and analyzed further in UPSC-BASE. Photosystem II Antenna Function in the Absence of LHCIIb—Low temperature absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to analyze the antenna in the asLhcb2 plants, to provide information on the organization of the pigments as well as their efficiency in supplying energy to the reaction center complexes. Fig. 1A shows 77 K absorption spectra of thylakoid membranes and their second derivatives. The latter was used to resolve the complex spectral structure to identify different chlorophyll species and assign them to various pigment proteins (27Kitajima M. Butler W.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 408: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). chl b (650 nm) and the short wavelength chl a at 661 nm are strongly reduced in the spectrum of asLhcb2 thylakoids, indicating the disappearance of typical LHCIIb spectral forms. The major maximum at 675 nm in wt is 3 nm red-shifted to 678 nm in asLhcb2, and the form at 683 nm, attributed to the PSII core antenna complex, CP47 (28de Weerd F.L. Palacios M.A. Andrizhiyevskaya E.G. Dekker J.P. van Grondelle R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15224-15233Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), is enhanced. The bands above 690 nm that belong to PSI (29Klimmek F. Ganeteg U. Ihalainen J.A. van Roon H. Jensen P.E. Scheller H.V. Dekker J.P. Jansson S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) remains unchanged, because the spectra were normalized in this region. This picture is consistent with the fact that in asLhcb2 plants the amount of LHCII is reduced and the PSII to PSI ratio is strongly enhanced, i.e. there is a larger number of PSII units with a smaller antenna size (16Andersson J. Wentworth M. Walters R.G. Howard C. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Jansson S. Plant J. 2003; 35: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B displays the 77 K fluorescence spectra of the wt and asLhcb2 thylakoids. The PSII fluorescence region from 670 to 700 nm was the most affected by the absence of LHCIIb. The difference spectrum, wt-minus-asLhcb2, exhibits a PSII core band at 685 nm with strong shoulders at 681 and 699 nm, both attributed to LHCIIb (30Ruban A.V. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 30-38Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This difference spectrum is explained by the reduction in content of LHCII, reducing the amount of energy transferred to the core and also the amount of direct emission. There is no indication of increase in fluorescence in the asLhcb2 plants that would arise from disconnected or nonfunctional antenna. Fig. 1C displays the Soret band absorption spectra and PSII fluorescence excitation spectra used to find whether the chl and xanthophyll species are transferring excitation energy to the PSII core in the asLhcb2 plants. For both wt and asLhcb2 thylakoids, the features in the absorption spectra closely matched those in the excitation spectra. The second derivative analysis of the wt and asLhcb2 absorption spectra revealed very similar chl a profiles and reduced participation of chl b (471 nm band) and efficient involvement of xanthophylls absorbing at 485 nm (neoxanthin) and 495 nm (lutein). The most red-shifted Soret band at 510 nm is present in the spectrum of both the wt and asLhcb2 thylakoids. This band is characteristic of the trimeric state of LHCIIb (31Ruban A.V. Pascal A. Robert B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A very similar picture was obtained using detection at 678 nm, the LHCII fluorescence band (not shown). Therefore these data reveal the characteristics of a new type of PSII antenna in the asLhcb2 plants in which antenna chls and xanthophylls are effectively transferring energy to the chl of PSII core complexes and which is likely to be trimeric. Polypeptide and Pigment Composition of LHCII—Thylakoid membranes from wt and asLhcb2 plants were solubilized with detergent and subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation, which separates three fractions enriched in PSI, PSII cores, and LHCII (Fig. 2A). In agreement with previous work (16Andersson J. Wentworth M. Walters R.G. Howard C. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Jansson S. Plant J. 2003; 35: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), measurement of the amount of chlorophyll in each fraction shows that the amount of PSI is very similar in both the wild type and antisense plants, but the amount of LHCII is approximately two times reduced and the PSII core complexes are twice enhanced in the asLhcb2 plants. As expected, the polypeptide composition of the LHCII fraction was also different. In the wt, this fraction shows the expected profile of LHCII polypeptides (Fig. 2B). In the preparation from the asLhcb2 plants, Lhcb4, Lhcb5, and Lhcb6 were found (arrows), with a significant increase in the relative content of Lhcb5, identified by the Western blotting, consistent with previous results (16Andersson J. Wentworth M. Walters R.G. Howard C. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Jansson S. Plant J. 2003; 35: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 17Ruban A.V. Wentworth M. Yakushevska A.E. Andersson J. Lee P.J. Keegstra W. Dekker J.P. Boekema E.J. Jansson S. Horton P. Nature. 2003; 421: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, in addition to the Lhcb polypeptides, a group of four smaller polypeptides from 20 to 23 kDa was clearly seen (bracketed). Western blotting using Lhca1-4 antibodies positively identified these as being from LHCI (Fig. 2C). It should be noted that the LHCII fraction from asLhcb2 did not contain the PSI core polypeptides, which are signified by the high molecular mass bands of the reaction center and the number of smaller bands ∼10 kDa. Normally, the Lhca proteins always stay very tightly attached to the PSI core under the solubilization conditions/treatments used here, and special treatments using a combination of nonionic and ionic detergents are needed to remove them. This suggests that the asLhcb2 plants contain a population of loosely bound LHCI not found in the wt. The pigment compositions of the wt and asLhcb2 thylakoids were different and reflected the reduction in LHCII and the increase in PSII content (Table 1). Thus, there were decreases in neoxanthin and chl b, which are enriched in LHCIIb, but an increase in β-carotene, found predominantly in reaction center cores. It is interesting to note that the content of the xanthophyll cycle carotenoids is higher in the asLhcb2 thylakoids, probably because of the increased content of minor LHCII. The carotenoid compositions of the LHCII fractions also differed. Again the xanthophyll cycle content is higher, whereas percentages of neoxanthin and lutein are reduced, as expected from the Lhcb compositions of these fractions and consistent with a fact that the xanthophyll cycle carotenoids have a stronger affinity for binding to the minor LHCII complexes than to LHCIIb. Also the amount of β-carotene is enhanced in the asLhcb2 preparation. This is likely to be a result of the presence of LHCI that is reported to bind this carotenoid (29Klimmek F. Ganeteg U. Ihalainen J.A. van Roon H. Jensen P.E. Scheller H.V. Dekker J.P. Jansson S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and also the CP47 and CP43 that are found in this fraction (Fig. 2B). The chl a/b ratio of the asLhcb2 LHCII preparation was higher than that for the wild type (2.0 versus 1.6).

https://openalex.org/W2018348972,"Increased NF-κB-mediated transcription has been extensively linked to tumorigenesis and can be stimulated by deregulated Rac1 signaling. For example, the overexpression of Rac1b, a highly activated splicing variant of Rac1 with increased expression in colorectal tumors, stimulates NF-κB-mediated G1/S progression and cell survival, and was shown to promote cell transformation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Here we show evidence of further complexity between Rac1b and Rac1 signaling toward NF-κBin colorectal cells. Consistent with data from other cell types we demonstrate that both Rac1 and Rac1b stimulate transcriptional activation from reporter genes driven by NF-κB motifs or the cyclin D1 promoter in an IκBα- and reactive oxygen species-dependent manner. However, we found that in colorectal cells Rac1, but not Rac1b, induces nuclear translocation of RelB and p52, activates transcription from a RelB-specific reporter, and can be isolated in a complex with endogenous RelB and its inhibitor NF-κB2/p100. In addition, Rac1 colocalizes at the plasma membrane with RelB, p100, and cullin-1, a core subunit of the E3 ubiquitin ligase that marks p100 for proteolytic processing to p52. Interestingly, this Rac1-specific pathway is not mediated via the production of reactive oxygen species. These data provide evidence that both Rac1 and Rac1b activate the canonical RelA-IκBα pathway, whereas Rac1 further stimulates NF-κB by inducing the RelB-NF-κB2/p100 pathway. The RelB pathway was reported to down-regulate canonical NF-κB activation during the inflammatory response, suggesting that increased levels of Rac1b in colorectal tumors may promote tumorigenesis by stimulating canonical NF-κB signaling while circumventing a negative feedback from the RelB pathway.

Rac1 belongs to the Rho family of small GTPases that regulate distinct signaling pathways involved in the control of many cellular processes (1Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar, 2Wennerberg K. Der C.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Rac signaling activates, for example, the protein kinase PAK, 2The abbreviations used are: PAK, p21-activated protein kinase; JNK, Jun NH2-terminal kinase; GAP, GTPase activating protein; GDI, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GTP, guanine nucleotide triphosphate; IκBα, inhibitor of κB protein α; NF-κB, nuclear factor of κB; ROS, reactive oxygen species; IKK, inhibitor of κB kinases; NIK, NF-κB-inducing kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DPI, diphenyleneiodonium chloride; HA, hemagglutinin; CRIB, Cdc421 Rac interactive binding. the Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). As a consequence, Rac1 signaling mediates changes in cell motility or adhesion and activates transcription factors such as NF-κB, AP1, and serum response factor, which can affect the expression of cell cycle regulatory and anti-apoptotic proteins. Through these effects aberrant Rac1 activity can also promote cellular transformation (1Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). Recently, alternative splicing variant Rac1b was identified in colorectal and breast tumors (3Jordan P. Brazão R. Boavida M.G. Gespach C. Chastre E.

It was shown to exist predominantly in the active GTP-bound state in vivo and in vitro and found unable to interact with Rho-GDI, thus lacking this mechanism of down-regulation. Expression of Rac1b caused growth transformation of NIH3T3 cells as shown by focus-formation assays and loss of density-dependent and anchorage-dependent growth regulation (7Singh A. Karnoub A.E. Palmby T.R. Lengye E. Sondek J. Der J.C. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 9369-9380Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of Rac1b under low-serum conditions was found sufficient to promote cyclin D1 accumulation and G1/S phase progression as well as increased resistance to apoptosis (8Matos P. Jordan P. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 305: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). An increase in Rac1b expression was reported during matrix metalloproteinase-3-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition of mouse mammary epithelial cells (9Radisky D.C. Levy D.D. Littlepage L.E.

Interestingly, several of the classical Rac1 signaling pathways such as lamellipodia formation or activation of PAK or JNK are not stimulated by activated Rac1b. However, Rac1b was reported to stimulate AKT phosphorylation (7Singh A. Karnoub A.E. Palmby T.R. Lengye E. Sondek J. Der J.C. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 9369-9380Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), ROS production (9Radisky D.C. Levy D.D. Littlepage L.E. Liu H. Nelson C.M. Fata J.E. Leake D. Godden E.L. Albertson D.G.

Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol.

Cell Res. 2005; 305: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a family of ubiquitously expressed transcription factors, which control the inflammatory response and the expression of genes involved in cell growth and survival. These properties are also intimately linked to the development of tumors (11Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2265) Google Scholar, 12Greten F.R. Eckmann L. Greten T.F. Park J.M. Li Z.W. Egan L.J. Kagnoff M.F. Karin M.

Galun E. Ben-Neriah Y. Nature. 2004; 431: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar). The NF-κB family is composed of five transcription factors that form homodimers or heterodimers with each other, namely RelA, RelB, c-Rel, p50, and p52. Unlike the three Rel proteins, p50 and p52 are produced from two inhibitory precursor proteins NF-κB1/p105 and NF-κB2/p100, respectively, through proteolytic processing. The NF-κB dimers remain transcriptionally inactive as long as they are associated with an ankyrin-repeat containing NF-κB inhibitor protein, such as IκBα,IκBβ,IκBϵ, or the NF-κB1/p105 or NF-κB2/p100 precursor proteins. Signaling pathways that activate NF-κB transcriptional activity involve phosphorylation of the NF-κB inhibitor proteins at specific serine residues by inhibitor of κB kinases (IKK). The RING-H2-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCF (Skp1/Cul-1/variable F-box protein complex) recognizes phosphorylated inhibitor proteins (14Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Davis M. Lavon I. Amit S.

Willems A. Peter M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1681-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and subsequent ubiquitination targets them for degradation by the 26 S proteasome (18Ciechanover A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). This enables NF-κB dimers to translocate into the nucleus and bind to the promoter regions of numerous target genes (19Dejardin E. Droin N.M. Delhase M. Haas E. Cao Y. Makris C. Li Z.W. Karin M.

Best understood is the tumor necrosis factor α-induced phosphorylation of IκBα by protein kinase IKKβ in a complex with kinase IKKα and a regulatory IKKγ/NEMO subunit. Phospho-IκBα is ubiquitinated by the SCF complex and then degraded, allowing the RelA-p50 dimer to translocate into the nucleus where it activates the transcription of genes encoding cytokines, adhesion molecules, and inhibitors of apoptosis. Besides this so called classical pathway, a second conserved pathway of NF-κB activation has been characterized (21Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 22Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M.

Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar) that targets NF-κB2/p100 rather than IκB for degradation, and involves the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) upstream of IKKα but independent of IKKβ and IKKγ (22Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). Through this pathway IKKα controls B cell maturation, formation of secondary lymphoid organs, and induction of a specific set of NF-κB target genes (19Dejardin E. Droin N.M. Delhase M. Haas E. Cao Y.

The COOH-terminal phosphorylation of p100 is also recognized by the SCF complex resulting in ubiquitination of Lys-855, a site homologous to Lys-22 in IκBα (24Amir R.E. Haecker H. Karin M. Ciechanover A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2540-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and subsequent degradation to p52. This second pathway specifically promotes the formation of RelB:p52 dimers that translocate to the nucleus and recognize a unique type of NF-κB sites in the promoter of target genes (25Bonizzi G. Bebien M. Otero D.C. Johnson-Vroom K.E. Cao Y. Vu D. Jegga A.G. Aronow B.J. Ghosh G. Rickert R.C. Karin M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4202-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). NF-κB2/p100 is the only IκB inhibitor molecule able to associate with RelB in vivo and inhibits both RelB nuclear localization and RelB-dependent transcriptional activation (26Solan N.J. Miyoshi H. Carmona E.M. Bren G.D. Paya C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1405-1418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Signaling from GTP-Rac1 activates the IKK complex, probably via the production of ROS, and results in the phosphorylation of IκBα.In addition, the inactive RelA-p50-phospho-IκBα complex is recruited to sites at the plasma membrane where Rac1 is activated and brings it into proximity with the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex. Cullin-1 is a core component of the SCF complex and was shown to interact directly with active Rac1 (27Senadheera D. Haataja L. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 8: 127-133PubMed Google Scholar), thus mediating membrane recruitment (28Boyer L. Travaglione S. Falzano L. Gauthier N.C. Popoff M.R. Lemichez E. Fiorentini C. Fabbri A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1124-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This activity is apparently shared by the variant Rac1b that was shown to induce phosphorylation of IκBα and to co-localize with phospho-IκBα at the plasma membrane (8Matos P. Jordan P. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 305: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Here we show that in colorectal tumor cells Rac1 activates both the classical and the NF-κB2/p100-RelB pathway, whereas Rac1b only activates the classical RelA-IκBα pathway. Cell Culture and Transfection—DLD-1, SW480, and HT29 colorectal cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and regularly checked for absence of mycoplasm infection. For transfections, cells at 60-80% confluence were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and analyzed 16-20 h later. Total amounts of transfected DNA were 4 μg/60-mm dish for immunoprecipitation and pulldown assays and 2 μg of DNA per 35-mm dish for immunofluorescence and reporter assays. When required, the amount of DNA was adjusted with empty vector. Transfection efficiency in DLD-1 cells was 40-50% as judged by expression of 2 mg of pcDNA3-GFP-Rac1b. DNA Plasmids and Constructs—The following constructs were received as gifts: pcDNA3-IκBα and pcDNA3-HA-IκBα(A32A36) (10DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol.

Pestell (Georgetown University, Washington, D. C.), and the 3x-κB-luc vector from B. Baumann (University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany). Rac1 and Rac1b cDNAs and their Q61L mutants were cloned into pcDNA3-Myc or pcDNA3-GFP vectors as described (5Matos P. Collard J.G. Jordan P. J. Biol.

SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Samples were prepared and detected as described (5Matos P. Collard J.G. Jordan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50442-50448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The antibodies used in this study were rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Myc A14 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; rabbit anti-HA from Sigma; rabbit anti-GFP ab290 from Abcam, United Kingdom; anti-β-tubulin clone Tub2.1 from Sigma (as a loading control); anti-Rac1, anti-cullin-1, and anti-p100/p52 from Upstate Biotechnologies; and anti-phospho-IκBα and anti-RelB from Hypromatrix. For densitometric analysis films from at least three independent experiments were digitalized and analyzed using ImageJ software (NIH). Active Rac Pulldown Assays and Immunoprecipitation—Approximately 2 × 106 DLD-1 cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes, transfected as indicated, and assayed 16-20 h later. Cells were washed in cold PBS, and lysed on ice in 250 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Total lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 5 min and 0.1 volume was added to 2× Laemmli sample buffer. The remaining lysate was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with a biotinylated CRIB-domain peptide pre-coupled to streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) as previously described (5Matos P. Collard J.G. Jordan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50442-50448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 29Price L.S. Langeslag M. ten Klooster J.P. Hordijk P.L. Jalink K. Collard J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39413-39421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Precipitated complexes were washed three times with excess lysis buffer. After the final wash, the supernatant was discarded and 20 μl of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer was added to the beads. Total lysates and precipitates were then analyzed by Western blot. The immunoprecipitation procedure was identical except that the lysates were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc (9E10, Sigma) or anti-HA (12CA5; Roche) antibodies at 2 μgml-1, pre-coupled to protein G-agarose beads (Roche). Precipitates were analyzed on Western blots as above. All results were confirmed in at least three independent experiments. Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown on 10 × 10-mm glass coverslips, transfected, and incubated as indicated above, then washed twice in PBS, immediately fixed with 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and subsequently permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed 3 times for 5 min in PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBS-T), incubated for 1 h with the primary antibodies anti-RelB (1:50), anti-p100/p52 (1:100), or anti-cullin-1 (1:50), then washed 3 times in PBS-T and incubated for 30 min with conjugated goat anti-rabbit Texas Red (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Coverslips were then washed 3 times in PBS-T, mounted in VectaShield (Vector Laboratories), and sealed with nail polish. Images were recorded with the 488- and 543-nm laser lines of a Zeiss LSM410 confocal microscope and processed with Adobe Photoshop software. Luciferase Reporter Assay—Approximately 5 × 105 DLD-1 cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes, co-transfected with 50 ng of the pRL-TK Reporter (a low level, constitutively expressed Renilla luciferase as internal control; Promega) and 500 ng of cyclin D1, standard NF-κB, or RelB-p52 specific reporters (see above), together with 250 ng of the indicated constructs. In IκBaa super-repressor titration experiments, cells were also transfected with 12.5-100 ng of pcDNA3-HA-IκBα(A32A36). Total DNA amount was adjusted to 2 μg with pCDNA3 empty vector. After 16-20 h post-transfection in the absence or presence of the NADPH-oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), cells were lysed, assayed with the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay (Promega), following the manufacturer's instructions, and measured in an Anthos Lucy-2 Luminometer. Lysates were assayed in duplicate and additional aliquots were analyzed by Western blot. All firefly luciferase values were first normalized to the corresponding values for Renilla luciferase and then plotted as -fold increase over the value of empty vector. The background luciferase activity of the original pGL3 vector was determined in parallel transfections and used as a cut-off value. All experiments were repeated in at least three independent transfection assays. Both Rac1 and Rac1b Stimulate κB Consensus- and Cyclin D1 Promoter-driven Gene Transcription—Previously, we reported that active Rac1b stimulates NF-κB-dependent responses in a mouse fibroblast model (8Matos P. Jordan P. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 305: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To extend these studies to colorectal cell lines we first compared the amount and activation of Rac1 and Rac1b in three different colorectal cancer cell lines. As shown in Fig. 1A, SW480 cells expressed no detectable Rac1b and revealed only Rac1 in the fraction of active, GTP-loaded Rac isolated by the PAK CRIB(CD)-domain pulldown assay. In contrast, HT29 cells expressed Rac1b and the pulldown assay revealed predominant activation of Rac1b over Rac1. DLD-1 cells represented an intermediate phenotype with little Rac1b expressed and a predominant activation of Rac1 with some active Rac1b. We therefore selected DLD-1 cells to study the effect of Rac1b overexpression on the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. Cells were transfected with either Myc-empty vector, Myc-Rac1-L61 or Myc-Rac1b-L61, and a luciferase-based reporter vector.

In a second set of experiments a reporter regulated by a canonical NF-κB-consensus motif was co-transfected. As shown in Fig. 1B the cyclin D1 promoter was activated by expression of both active Rac1 and Rac1b to the same extent. Curiously, when the effect of both Rac variants on the canonical NF-κB reporter was measured, a difference was observed: whereas active Rac1 increased luciferase expression 11.3-fold, active Rac1b only induced a 5.2-fold increase (Fig. 1C). In six independent experiments this difference was highly reproducible: 2.2 ± 0.2-fold (p < 0.001). Rac1, but Not Rac1b, Stimulates NF-κB Activity through an IκBα- and ROS-independent Pathway—Rac-induced stimulation of NF-κB-mediated transcription has been shown to involve the generation of ROS (33Sundaresan M.

To test if this pathway was responsible for the stimulation of the NF-κB reporter in DLD-1 cells we inhibited both processes by using increasing amounts of either the non-phosphorylatable and non-degradable super-repressor IκBα(A32A36) (IκBaa) (10DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol.

Indeed, both co-expression of IκBaa and DPI treatment inhibited Rac1- and Rac1b-mediated stimulation of the NF-κB reporter (Fig. 2), placing Rac1/Rac1b signaling upstream of the proteolytic degradation of the inhibitor in a ROS-dependent pathway. Unexpectedly, however, only the Rac1b-mediated luciferase induction was suppressed to background levels. The stimulatory effect of Rac1, on the contrary, although significantly decreased, reached a stable threshold of around one-third the activation (Fig. 2). These data suggested that there might be an additional pathway downstream of Rac1, but not of Rac1b, leading to NF-κB activation independently of ROS production and not efficiently repressed by IκBα. Rac1 Stimulates RelB-p52-mediated NF-κB Activity—Because the consensus κB motifs present in the reporter vector used were previously described to be recognized by both the canonical (p50-p65RelA and p50-c-Rel) and the non-canonical (p52-RelB) NF-κB dimers, we determined the contribution of both Rac variants to these pathways in more detail. Whereas RelA and c-Rel require degradation of IκBα for activation, RelB is inhibited by p100, the proteolysis of which removes inhibition and simultaneously yields the RelB-dimer partner p52. We first determined the effect of activated Rac1 and Rac1b on the endogenous protein levels of IκBα and p52 in DLD-1 cells. The expression of both activated Rac1 and Rac1b was found to induce the degradation of IκBα to similar values. In contrast, only activated Rac1 was able to induce a significant increase in the transcriptionally competent p52 component of the non-canonical pathway (Fig. 3A). Although the absolute protein variations were moderate due to a limited transfection efficiency of around 40%, they were, nevertheless, statistically significant and reproducible. To confirm this effect of Rac1 we generated a luciferase reporter vector containing a RelB-p52-specific recognition sequence from the Blc promoter that was recently reported (25Bonizzi G. Bebien M. Otero D.C. Johnson-Vroom K.E. Cao Y. Vu D. Jegga A.G. Aronow B.J. Ghosh G. Rickert R.C. Karin M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4202-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). We found that, in contrast to the conventional κB reporter (see Fig. 2), this RelB-p52-specific reporter construct was not activated by expression of RelA but responded to the kinase NIK, an activator of the RelB pathway (Fig. 3B). In addition, only Rac1, but not Rac1b, was able to activate this reporter plasmid and this activation was not significantly affected by either the expression of the IκBaa super-repressor or treatment with the ROS production inhibitor DPI (Fig. 3B)."

It has been implicated in dendritic filapodial extension (1Fink C.C. Bayer K.U. Myers J.W. Ferrell J.E. Jr-Schulman H. Meyer T.

Turrigiano G.G. Neuron. 2003; 39: 269-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and most notably, the phenomenon of long-term potentiation (LTP) (4Lledo P.M. Hjelmstad G.O. Mukherji S. Soderling T.R. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11175-11179Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 5Malinow R. Schulman H. Tsien R.W.

Neuron. 2004; 44: 5-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2956) Google Scholar). Although several candidates have been proposed to mediate the synaptic consequences of activating CaMKII (7Lisman J. Schulman H. Cline H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar), it has been difficult to characterize how synaptic proteins are phosphorylated by CaMKII when incorporated into functioning synapses. This is a particularly important and challenging issue because biochemical and proteomic approaches to identifying CaMKII substrates in the postsynaptic density (PSD), the electron dense postsynaptic specialization that contains glutamate receptors and associated signaling machinery, have found at least 28 potential substrate proteins (8Yoshimura Y. Aoi C. Yamauchi T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 81: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is unknown whether stimulus-dependent substrate specificity is an inherent property of the PSD and whether the source of the calcium that activates CaMKII and protein phosphatase activity influence synaptic substrate phosphorylation. Some recent evidence suggests that the intricate scaffolding of proteins within different levels of the PSD may influence CaMKII signal transduction. First, electron microscopy studies on isolated PSDs have revealed both a laminar and heterogeneous distribution of CaMKII on the cytosolic face, suggesting that CaMKII may be specifically positioned to exert its activity on nanodomains within this macromolecular complex (9Petersen J.D. Chen X. Vinade L. Dosemeci A. Lisman J.E. Reese T.S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11270-11278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, CaMKII interactions with the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) subunit NR2B (10Bayer K.U. De Koninck P. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Schulman H. Nature. 2001; 411: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) and the Drosophila homolog of CASK, Cmg (11Lu C.S. Hodge J.J. Mehren J. Sun X.X. Griffith L.C.

Garner C.C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 911-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), have both been found to influence its state of activation, with NR2B resulting in calcium-independent activity and Cmg/CASK promoting inhibitory autophosphorylation (10Bayer K.U. De Koninck P. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Schulman H. Nature. 2001; 411: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 11Lu C.S. Hodge J.J. Mehren J. Sun X.X. Griffith L.C. Neuron. 2003; 40: 1185-1197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Third, the sensitivity of CaMKII to protein phosphatases PP2A and PP1 is altered by PSD incorporation (13Strack S. Barban M.A. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2119-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that CaMKII activity itself can be affected by its PSD binding partners. It is unknown, however, how CaMKII substrate selection is influenced by kinase and substrate placement at synapses, presumably within the PSD. To begin to address this issue, we have tagged a number of prominent potential CaMKII synaptic substrates with a short peptide known to be specifically phosphorylated by CaMKII and visualized their phosphorylation in cultured neurons using a specific phosphoantibody. Surprisingly, we find remarkable discrimination between substrates that should be located within nanometer distances of one another within the PSD. NMDAR-dependent activation of CaMKII caused robust phosphorylation of the synaptic scaffold protein PSD-95 (12Montgomery J.M. Zamorano P.L. Garner C.C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 911-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14Kim E. Sheng M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar) and Stargazin, a protein critically important for the trafficking and surface expression of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) (15Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S. Sweeney N.T. Kawasaki Y. Wenthold R.J. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 2000; 408: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, the NMDAR subunit NR2B and the AMPAR subunit GluR1 reporter constructs were minimally phosphorylated even though their intracellular C-terminal tails were phosphorylated when expressed alone. These results suggest that the exact manner in which substrates are scaffolded within the architecture of the PSD at synapses profoundly affects their phosphorylation by activated CaMKII. This differential phosphorylation of substrates by CaMKII has important implications for the mechanism by which CaMKII regulates synaptic function during various forms of experience-dependent plasticity. Gene Construction—Vim-CFP was constructed by amplifying the initial 264-bp sequence from the vimentin head by PCR and GFP containing NES from HIV Rev (LPPLERLTL) into BaMHI and EcoRI sites in lentiviral expression vector, FC1.2 under the αCaMKII promoter. PSD95-Vim-CFP was subcloned into AgeI and EcoRI sites in FC1.2. The Vim head sequence was inserted into the ApaI site in NR2B at position 4263 corresponding to amino acid 1421. GFP-NR2B-Vim was then cloned into BaMHI and EcoRI sites in Lentiviral expression vector, FUGW under the ubiquitin promoter. GFP was inserted after the GluR1 signal sequence, and the Vim head sequence was inserted by PCR at position 2688 corresponding to amino acid 880. GFP-GluR1-Vim was then cloned into BaMHI and EcoRI sites in FUGW. NR2B- and GluR1-Vim C-terminal constructs were amplified by PCR and inserted after NES-GFP (LPPLERLTL-GFP). NES-GFP-C-terminal constructs were then cloned into BaMHI and EcoRI sites in FUGW. Vim-CFP was inserted into the BglII site of Stargazin (CACNG2) at position 800 corresponding to amino acid 270. Stgz-Vim-GFP was then cloned into BaMHI and EcoRI sites in FC1.2. CaMKII-HA and Lyn-cNR2B were cloned as described previously (16De Koninck P. Schulman H.

Cell Culture, Transfection, and Stimulation Protocols—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and were transfected with expression plasmids using Lipofectamine Plus™ (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after the transfection, the cells were preincubated for 10 min with HBSS 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and drugs as indicated. To inhibit CaMKII activity, KN-93 (10 μm) (Calbiochem) and Tat-Cntide (25 μm) (1Fink C.C. Bayer K.U. Myers J.W. Ferrell J.E. Jr-Schulman H. Meyer T.

A. 1998; 95: 10890-10895Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) were applied in culture medium for 1 h prior to stimulation. Stimulation was done with ionomycin (10 μm) (Calbiochem) and Ca2+ (2 mm) for 3 min. Dissociated neurons were prepared from p0 Sprague-Dawley pups as previously described with minor changes (19Stellwagen D. Beattie E.C. Seo J.Y. Malenka R.C. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3219-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). After manufacturing problems with B-27 supplement (Invitrogen) starting May 2004, neurons were initially plated in B-27 supplemented Neurobasal media, but re-fed subsequently with N-2-supplemented MEM plus GlutaMax (Invitrogen). Glial growth was inhibited by FUDR at 3 DIV. Neurons were infected with lentiviruses on DIV 9 and used in experiments on DIV 14-16. Lentiviruses were harvested from HEK293 cells transfected with expression vector carrying reporter constructs and lentiviral helper plasmids Δ8.9 and VSVG using Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) as previously described (20Lois C. Hong E.J. Pease S. Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 295: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar). To stimulate neurons several different protocols were used: 2-min bath applications of 100 μm NMDA (Calbiochem), 100 μm glutamate in Mg2+-free media or 20 μm glutamate (Sigma), 10 μm ionomycin (Calbiochem), 3-min application of 1 μm PDBU (Sigma), or 15-min application of 50 μm picrotoxin (Tocris) in Mg2+-free media. To block all sources of Ca2+ other than NMDARs, l-type Ca2+ channel blocker Nifedipine (5 μm, Calbiochem), R/T-type Ca2+ channel blocker NiCl2 (100 μm), P/Q/N-type Ca2+ channel blocker ω-Conotoxin MVIIC (1 μm, Tocris), mGluR antagonist LY341495 (100 μm, Tocris), and TTX (1 μm, Sigma) were simultaneously applied for 15 min prior to and during NMDA treatment. Bis-I (10 μm, Calbiochem), FK-506 (25 μm, Fujisawa Healthcare), okadaic acid (1 μm, Calbiochem), MK-801 (10 μm, Calbiochem), were preapplied for 15 min in HBSS, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Hepes pH 7.4 as indicated. Immunocytochemistry and Immunoblotting—All cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 100 mm phosphate buffer for 10 min, followed by 0.1% Triton-X permeabilization for 10 min. They were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibodies in PBS with 2% NGS at the following concentrations: phosphovimentin MO82 (1:1000, MBL), GFP (1:1000, Invitrogen), synaptophysin (1:150, Sigma), PSD-95 (1:100, Sigma), HA (1:2000, Covance). Immunoreactivities were visualized by incubation with species-appropriate Alexa 488-, 568-, and 647-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen), and the samples were mounted with Fluoromount medium (EMS). Data were collected with a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal microscope under a ×63, 1.4NA objective. For constructs that were not exclusively synaptically targeted (all but PSD-95), synaptic puncta were selected on Metamorph (Universal Imaging) by creating masks based on synaptophysin staining, and selecting GFP positive areas that colocalized. The pVim image was divided by the GFP image, and resulting pVim/GFP puncta were quantified. Quantification was performed on Metamorph and subsequent statistical analysis (ANOVA) on SPSS (SPSS, Inc). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (10Bayer K.U. De Koninck P. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Schulman H. Nature. 2001; 411: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). GluR1 (Chemicon) antibody was used at 1:1000, phospho-Ser831 (Upstate Biotechnology) at 1:500, NR2B (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) at 1:1000, phospho-Ser1303 (Upstate Biotechnology) at 1:1000. Membranes were stripped between blots with Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) per the manufacturer's instructions. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. For immunocytochemical experiments, n refers to number of cells examined. For Western blot experiments, n refers to number of independent blots examined. Each experimental manipulation was performed in a minimum of three different culture preparations. Previous work examining CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of synaptic proteins has almost entirely depended on biochemical approaches, which by necessity require disruption of the native molecular architecture of the synapse. Whereas these studies have provided invaluable information about the identity of proteins that potentially can be phosphorylated by CaMKII, they do not necessarily reflect which substrates are in fact phosphorylated by CaMKII at intact, functioning synapses. To begin to address this issue we took advantage of the existence of a sequence derived from the head region of vimentin (Vim) containing a dedicated CaMKII phosphorylation site at Ser82 (21Inagaki N. Nishizawa M. Arimura N. Yamamoto H. Takeuchi Y. Miyamoto E. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27165-27171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The short sequence (88 amino acids) of Vim containing Ser82 is a highly specific substrate for CaMKII in that it is not phosphorylated by any other major Ser/Thr kinases, including CaMKI, CaMKIV, PKC, cdc2, and PKA (21Inagaki N.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25195-25199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Importantly, in both heterologous cells and neurons, via the immunocytochemical detection of a specific antibody against the phosphorylated form of Ser82, ectopically expressed Vim has proved to be a sensitive probe for CaMKII activity (17Tsui J. Inagaki M. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9210-9216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 21Inagaki N. Nishizawa M. Arimura N. Yamamoto H. Takeuchi Y. Miyamoto E. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27165-27171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether tagging synaptic proteins with the head region of Vim would be useful in detecting their CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation at intact synapses, we first examined the phosphorylation of a soluble Vim probe containing a nuclear export signal and fused to CFP (Fig. 1). When expressed in HEK293 cells only minimal staining with the phosphovimentin (pVim) antibody was detected (Fig. 1B). Stimulation of these cells with the calcium ionophore ionomycin caused a ∼2-fold increase in the intensity of pVim staining (2.18 ± 0.09 times control levels, n = 169) and, consistent with previous work in both heterologous cells and neurons (1Fink C.C. Bayer K.U. Myers J.W. Ferrell J.E. Jr-Schulman H. Meyer T. Neuron. 2003; 39: 283-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 18Chang B.H. Mukherji S. Soderling T.R. Proc.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27165-27171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this was completely blocked by inhibitors of CaMKII (1.02 ± 0.06, n = 178; Fig. 1, B and C). Having confirmed that pVim staining is caused by CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation, we next expressed this same construct in cultured hippocampal neurons. Immunocytochemical measurements were limited to only those puncta that colocalized with the presynaptic marker synaptophysin and thus our analysis reflects phosphorylation specifically at postsynaptic sites. Furthermore, to compare phosphorylation between synapses expressing variable amounts of vimentin reporter proteins, the magnitude of pVim staining was normalized to the magnitude of GFP staining, which directly correlates with protein level (see “Experimental Procedures”). pVim and anti-GFP antibody staining were used to quantitate phosphorylation of all reporter constructs, allowing comparison between reporters. Whereas control, unstimulated neurons displayed only a modest degree of synaptic pVim staining, this was increased by any one of three manipulations designed to activate CaMKII at synapses (Fig. 1, D and E). Specifically: 1) direct activation of NMDARs by application of NMDA (100 μm for 2 min; 1.24 ± 0.03 times control levels, n = 81), 2) application of a solution containing the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin and 0 Mg2+ (1.25 ± 0.04, n = 95); a solution which will increase excitatory network activity in the cultures and enhance activation of synaptic NMDARS, and 3) application of the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (10 μm for 2 min; 1.43 ± 0.05, n = 104). As Vim is not expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons, this pVim signal solely reflects CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of the recombinant protein (21Inagaki N. Nishizawa M. Arimura N. Yamamoto H.

These results confirm and extend previous work demonstrating that immunocytochemical detection of Vim Ser82 phosphorylation permits visualization of CaMKII activity at synapses (21Inagaki N.

We also found that the NMDA-stimulated pVim staining was enhanced by pretreating cultures with the protein phosphatase 1/2A inhibitor okadaic acid (1 μm) and the calcineurin inhibitor FK-506 (25 μm) (1.68 ± 0.04, n = 21; Fig. 1, D and E) indicating that CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of this Vim substrate is sensitive to phosphatase activity at synapses. Lack of Phosphorylation of Synaptic NR2B and GluR1 by CaMKII—To examine the substrate specificity of CaMKII phosphorylation at intact excitatory synapses using pVim staining we fused the Vim head sequence to four ubiquitous postsynaptic proteins (Fig. 1A) that were selected because they are in vitro substrates for CaMKII and have been implicated in playing important roles in CaMKII-mediated synaptic plasticity, yet are positioned in different microdomains within the PSD (14Kim E.

We began by examining phosphorylation of the NR2B subunit of the NMDAR, a known substrate and binding partner for CaMKII (30Gardoni F. Caputi A. Cimino M. Pastorino L. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1733-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 31Strack S. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20689-20692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). GFP-NR2B-Vim (Fig. 1A) was phosphorylated by CaMKII in HEK293 cells in response to ionomycin treatment and consistent with previous results (10Bayer K.U. De Koninck P. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Schulman H. Nature. 2001; 411: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 31Strack S. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20689-20692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) CaMKII exhibited Ca2+-dependent co-localization with GFP-NR2B-Vim (Fig. 2A). When expressed in neurons, GFP-NR2B-Vim trafficked to the cell surface and formed synaptic puncta as evidenced by their colocalization with the presynaptic marker, synaptophysin (data not shown). It was therefore surprising to find that multiple different treatments, which caused clear phosphorylation of soluble Vim at synapses, did not elicit phosphorylation of GFP-NR2B-Vim (1.04-1.14-fold increase over control, n = 20-47; Fig. 2, B and C). Only by treating neurons with the phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and FK-506 prior to application of NMDA could we obtain a modest, increase in pVim staining (1.19 ± 0.04, n = 33; Fig. 2C). Although these results suggest that NR2B is not normally phosphorylated by CaMKII at intact synapses, it is possible that endogenous NR2B behaves differently than the recombinant GFP-NR2B-Vim. We therefore performed Western blot analysis of the endogenous CaMKII phosphorylation site on NR2B (32Omkumar R.V. Kiely M.J. Rosenstein A.J. Min K.T. Kennedy M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31670-31678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) using an antibody that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated form of serine 1303. Western blots of total neuron lysates revealed no increase in Ser1303 phosphorylation after stimulation of neurons with glutamate (100 μm) and furthermore, no change in basal phosphorylation following preincubation of cultures with the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 (10 μm) (Fig. 2, D and E). Thus, despite the direct binding of NR2B to CaMKII, NR2B does not appear to be a good substrate for CaMKII at synapses. What might be restricting the phosphorylation of NR2B by CaMKII? As GFP-NR2B-Vim was localized to the synaptic plasma membrane, one possibility is that restricting NR2B to this subcellular domain may greatly limit its CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation. To test this possibility, we generated a soluble version of the C-terminal tail of NR2B, which contained Ser1303 and was still fused to GFP and Vim (GFP-cNR2B-Vim) (Fig. 1A). This construct was phosphorylated robustly in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2A) and showed greater basal phosphorylation than GFP-NR2B-Vim at intact synapses when expressed in neurons (1.45 ± 0.07, n = 37; Fig. 2, B and C). Importantly, similar to soluble Vim-CFP, NMDA treatment increased its phosphorylation (1.81 ± 0.07, n = 40), which was further increased by pretreatment with phosphatase inhibitors (2.10 ± 0.09, n = 42; Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the exact position of proteins within the PSD at excitatory synapses can influence and even prevent CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of otherwise eligible substrates. Another important synaptic membrane protein that is phosphorylated by CaMKII and has specifically been implicated in playing a critically important role in LTP is the AMPAR subunit GluR1 (33Lee H.K.

Nature. 2000; 405: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Indeed, phosphorylation of GluR1 affects the biophysical properties of AMPARs in a manner similar to that seen during LTP (39Derkach V. Barria A. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3269-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of great interest to examine GFP-GluR1-Vim (Fig. 1A) and determine whether its membrane localization at synapses restricts or enhances its phosphorylation by CaMKII. Surprisingly, it behaved very similarly to NR2B. When expressed in HEK293 cells, GFP-GluR1-Vim was robustly phosphorylated in response to ionomycin treatment (Fig. 3A) and in neurons, as previously reported for GFP-GluR1 (40Shi S.H. Hayashi Y. Petralia R.S. Zaman S.H. Wenthold R.J. Svoboda K. Malinow R. Science. 1999; 284: 1811-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar) it trafficked to the synaptic plasma membrane (data not shown). However, synaptic GFP-GluR1-Vim was either not phosphorylated or minimally phosphorylated when cultured neurons were activated by a number of different treatments including NMDA application (100 μm) (1.13 ± 0.05, n = 32), picrotoxin in 0 Mg2+ buffer (1.05 ± 0.04, n = 37), 200 μm glutamate in 0 Mg2+ buffer (1.18 ± 0.02, n = 21), and ionomycin (10 μm; 1.07 ± 0.05, n = 24) (Fig. 3, B and C). Furthermore, preincubation with the protein phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and FK-506 did not enhance GFP-GluR1-Vim phosphorylation (1.06 ± 0.03, n = 34; Fig. 3C). As was done for NR2B, to determine whether a soluble, non-membrane localized form of GluR1 can be phosphorylated we examined the C terminus of GluR1, which was fused to GFP and Vim (GFP-cGluR1-Vim, Fig. 1A) and contains Ser831, a residue known to be phosphorylated by CaMKII (35Barria A. Derkach V. Soderling T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32727-32730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) This construct was phosphorylated robustly both in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3A) and at synapses relative to GFP-GluR1-Vim, (1.98 ± 0.08, n = 68; Fig. 3C). Interestingly, application of NMDA with (2.10 ± 0.01, n = 35) or without (2.13 ± 0.09, n = 58) phosphatase inhibitors did not further enhance GFP-cGluR1-Vim phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that like NR2B, the membrane localization of GluR1 restricts its"

Electrostatic interactions involving the α-helical “portal” region of the protein have been shown to be of great importance. In the present study, the role of specific lysine residues in the α-helical region of IFABP was directly examined. A series of point mutants in rat IFABP was engineered in which the lysine positive charges in this domain were eliminated or reversed. Using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay, we analyzed the rates and mechanism of fatty acid transfer from wild type and mutant proteins to acceptor membranes. Most of the α-helical domain mutants showed slower absolute fatty acid transfer rates to zwitterionic membranes, with substitution of one of the lysines of the α2 helix, Lys27, resulting in a particularly dramatic decrease in the fatty acid transfer rate. Sensitivity to negatively charged phospholipid membranes was also reduced, with charge reversal mutants in the α2 helix the most affected. The results support the hypothesis that the portal region undergoes a conformational change during protein-membrane interaction, which leads to release of the bound fatty acid to the membrane and that the α2 segment is of particular importance in the establishment of charge-charge interactions between IFABP and membranes. Cross-linking experiments with a phospholipid-photoactivable reagent underscored the importance of charge-charge interactions, showing that the physical interaction between wild-type intestinal fatty acid-binding protein and phospholipid membranes is enhanced by electrostatic interactions. Protein-membrane interactions were also found to be enhanced by the presence of ligand, suggesting different collisional complex structures for holo- and apo-IFABP.

Prog. Lipid Res. 1996; 35: 243-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The precise physiological functions of these proteins are as yet unclear, but it is hypothesized that they are important in intracellular transport and targeting of FA to specific membranous organelles and metabolic pathways. Intestinal fatty acid-binding protein is abundantly produced in the enterocyte, where a second fatty acid-binding protein (FABP), liver FABP (LFABP), is also highly expressed (2Bass N.M. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1985; 38: 95-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It is not known why a single cell type contains two distinct types of FABP nor whether one or both participate in the intracellular trafficking and compartmentation of lipid. A number of differences between the two enterocyte FABPs, in binding specificity and stoichiometry and in ligand transport properties, suggest unique functional properties (1Glatz J.F.C. van der Vusse G.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 1996; 35: 243-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 3Hsu K.T. Storch J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry,. 2004; 43: 3600-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To address the putative transport function of the FABPs, we have used an in vitro fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay to examine the rate and mechanism of transfer of fluorescently tagged fatty acids from FABPs to phospholipid membranes. These studies have demonstrated that transfer of fatty acids from IFABP to membranes appears to occur during direct collisional interactions between the protein and the acceptor membrane (3Hsu K.T. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13317-13323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In contrast, LFABP employs a different FA transfer mechanism, involving an initial release of the ligand to the aqueous milieu prior to its membrane association (5Kim H.K. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 77-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As discussed previously (3Hsu K.T. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13317-13323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 6Storch J. Thumser E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 28-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that “collisional” fatty acid transfer by IFABP may be necessary for specific targeting of this physiologically important lipid. Moreover, it is also possible that IFABP forms charge-charge interactions with acidic domains on membrane proteins, thereby facilitating the targeted transport of intracellular fatty acids. In addition, the absolute rate of fatty acid transfer by IFABP-membrane interaction is dramatically increased relative to off-rates for fatty acids from FABPs into solution, supporting the idea of greater efficiency of fatty acid trafficking via the collisional mechanism. Fatty acid-binding proteins share a common tertiary structure consisting of 10 antiparallel β-strands that form a β-barrel, which is capped by two short α-helices arranged as a helix-turn-helix segment. It is believed that this helical domain is part of a “dynamic portal” that regulates fatty acid (FA) entry and exit from the internal binding cavity (7Hodsdon M.E. Cistola D.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1450-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 8Córsico B. Cistola D.P. Frieden C. Storch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12174-12178Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The structural elements underlying collisional transfer of a fatty acid from IFABP to membranes could have important physiological consequences, since they may dictate the fatty acid trafficking patterns within the cell. Using a helixless variant of IFABP (9Kim K. Cistola D.P. Frieden C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7553-7558Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and employing chimeric proteins generated by exchanging the helix-turn-helix domains between IFABP and LFABP, we have demonstrated that the α-helical region of IFABP plays a primary role in the collisional transfer of fatty acid from IFABP to membranes (8Córsico B.

Abundant experimental evidence has indicated that electrostatic interactions are a major determinant of the mechanism of FA transfer from all of the “collisional” proteins of this family (adipocyte, heart, brain, myelin, and intestinal FABPs) (11Herr F.M.

Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1765-1772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, an analysis of surface electrostatic potential topologies for several FABPs demonstrated a net positive potential across the helix-turn-helix portal region of “collisional transfer” FABPs (17LiCata V.J. Bernlohr D.A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 33: 577-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which supports the suggestion that this region is important for interactions with membranes. It is noteworthy that the α1 helices of IFABP, heart FABP, and adipocyte FABP are amphipathic, whereas α1 helices of LFABP, liver basic FABP, and cellular retinoid-binding protein II, which do not employ a collisional ligand transfer mechanism, are not (18Di Pietro S.M. Córsico B. Perduca M. Monaco H.L. Santomé J.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8192-8203Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Amphipathic helices are known to be important motifs in the targeting of proteins to membranes, and the charge characteristics of a helix are believed to modulate interactions with membranes (19Anantharamaiah G.M. Jones M.K. Segrest J.P. Epand R.M. The Amphipathic Helix. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 110-143Google Scholar). In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the lysine residues of the α-helical domain of IFABP play an important role in the collision-based transfer of FA to membranes. Several pairs of point mutants of IFABP were engineered so as to neutralize or reverse the positive charge of the lysines present in the α-helical domain (Lys16, Lys20, Lys27, and Lys29) as well as Lys92 in the β-barrel (Fig. 1). The primary objectives of this work were to determine whether the elimination of positively charged residues in the α-helical domain of IFABP would alter the rate and, potentially, the mechanism of transfer of FA from the mutant proteins to membranes, compared with the wild-type IFABP (wtIFABP), and to assess the relative contributions of each of the charged residues. A fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay was used to assess the kinetics of FA transfer from FABPs to membranes, and direct interaction of the IFABPs with phospholipid membranes was determined using a cross-linking assay with vesicles containing a photoactivable reagent. The results demonstrate that no single lysine was solely responsible for the FA transfer properties of IFABP. Rather, all of the Lys residues of the α-helical domain contribute to the collisional mechanism of FA transfer from IFABP to model membranes. Lys residues of the α2 segment are of particular importance in the FA transfer process. The mutagenic primers were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Pfu DNA polymerase, pGEM-T easy vector, and restriction enzymes XbaI and BamHI were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). T4 DNA ligase, pET-11a expression vector, and BL21 (DE3) cells were obtained from Novagen (Milwaukee, WI). Sodium oleate was obtained from Nu-Chek Prep (Elysan, MN). Fluorescently labeled AOFA, 12-(9-anthroyloxy)oleic acid (12AO), and acrylodated IFABP (ADIFAB) were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC), N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl) egg phosphatidylcholine (NBD-PC), brain phosphatidylserine (PS), and bovine heart cardiolipin (CL) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Lipidex-1000 was purchased from Sigma. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was obtained from Fisher. [125I]NaI was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other chemicals were reagent grade or better. IFABP has four lysine residues in the helix-turn-helix domain, two in each α-helical segment. A series of point mutants were constructed substituting lysine for isoleucine to eliminate the charge and lysine for glutamic acid to reverse the charge. Isoleucine and glutamic acid were chosen to replace lysine due to their respective neutral and negative charges and the relatively similar bulkiness to lysine, so as to maintain the approximate side chain size along the backbone of the protein. Thus, eight mutations in the α-helical region were constructed, and an additional pair of mutants, K92I and K92E, was also generated to assess the effects of a nonhelix domain basic residue; Lys92 is located in β strand G. Recombinant rat pET11d-IFABP plasmid was generously provided by Drs. Alan Kleinfeld and Ron Ogata (Medical Biology Institute, La Jolla, CA). A single or double mutation was introduced in the IFABP sequence employing overlapping PCR methodology (20Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7667Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). The same external primers were used for all constructs: 5′-CGGATAACAATTCCCCTCTA-3′ and 5′-TTCCTTTCGGGCTTTGTTAG-3′. Each mutation was verified by sequence analysis. Mutant DNA sequences were subcloned into the pET-11a expression vector by using XbaI and BamHI restriction sites. All proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 harboring pET constructs for wild-type and point mutant proteins, as detailed elsewhere (3Hsu K.T. Storch J. J. Biol.

Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4253-4269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); thus, maintenance of binding site integrity was expected. To assess this directly, the overall conformation and ligand binding site properties of the mutant IFABPs were examined by several methods.

Silicon Graphics workstations running the InsightII program (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) were used to replace amino acids to generate initial models, one single site replacement for each mutant protein. We then performed conformational energy minimization, first adding hydrogens to the structures, since the Protein Data Bank files contained heavy atoms only. The modeling pH was set to 7.4. The “soak” facility of InsightII was used to create a layer of water molecules around the protein 5.0 Å thick. Water molecules present in the crystallographic files were retained prior to “soaking” as well as the bound palmitate in the holo structure. The energy was then minimized to convergence using default settings. The wild type molecules in the PDB files were also minimized in order that comparisons between wild type and mutants would compare structures that had been treated identically. Bond lengths, bond angles, and Ramachandran plots were normal (data not shown). Analysis of solvent-accessible surface area was by the method of Lee and Richards (23Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5346) Google Scholar) using the program ACCESS (24Richards F.M. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 440-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The ACCESS output was sorted and compiled by BINS (25Kajander T. Kahn P.C. Passila S.H. Cohen D.C. Lehtio L. Adolfsen W. Warwicker J. Schell U. Goldman A. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 8: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which classifies each atom as to whether it is aliphatic, aromatic, polar uncharged, or polar charged and aggregates the results for each amino acid and for the protein as a whole. Volumes were computed by the Voronoi method with the program VOLUME, the output being compiled by VOLFMT (26Richards F.M. Biophys. Bioeng. 1974; 82: 1-14Google Scholar, 27Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 6: 151-176Google Scholar). CD Spectra—CD spectra were obtained at 25 °C on an Aviv model 60DS spectropolarimeter using a 0.1-cm path length quartz cuvette (Hellma). Spectra of the wild-type and mutant proteins were obtained from five scans between 200 and 260 nm of a 0.15 mg/ml protein concentration solution to evaluate shape, ellipticity, and maximum and minimum positions. Fluorescent Quantum Yields—Fluorescent quantum yields (Qf) of 12-(9-anthroyloxy)oleic acid (12AO) bound to wild-type and mutant IFABPs were determined using quinine sulfate in 0.1 n H2SO4 as the reference fluorophore, with Qref = 0.7 (28Storch J. Bass N.M. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8708-8713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Excitation was at 352 nm for quinine sulfate and 383 nm for 12AO. Binding of Oleate—Binding of oleate to wild-type and mutant IFABPs was analyzed by the method employing the fluorescent probe ADIFAB (29Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23918-23930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which allows for the direct measurement of unbound fatty acid in equilibrium with FABP. Oleate prepared as a 25 mm stock solution of the sodium salt in water at pH 9.7 containing 25 μm BHT was titrated into 2.5 ml of 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, and 1 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.4) containing 0.2 μm ADIFAB and 4 μm wild type or mutant IFABP. Following equilibration at 37 °C for 5 min, fluorescence emission intensities at 505 and 432 nm were measured using an SLM-8000C spectrofluorometer, with excitation at 386 nm. The average and S.D. of 10 pairs of R (emission 505 nm/emission 432 nm) values were determined. This average was applied to binding equilibrium analysis using a standard value of Rmax = 11.5 (29Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23918-23930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experimental values were fitted to a single-site Scatchard analysis, and Kd values for oleate binding were obtained. Relative Partition Coefficient—The relative partition coefficient (Kp) for AOFA partitioning between wild type or mutant IFABPs and small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) was determined by measuring AOFA fluorescence at a given molar ratio of protein/SUV after titration of SUV into a solution containing 5 μm protein and 0.5 μm 12AO in 40 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS) at 25 °C (30Massey J.B. Bick D.H. Pownall H.J. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1732-1743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 31Storch J. Hepathology. 1990; 12: 1447-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Kp=([FABP-bound AOFA]/[FABP])([SUV-bound AOFA]/[SUV])Eq. 1 The decrease in AOFA fluorescence upon titration of AOFA-containing FABP with SUVs was related to Kp by the following equation, 1/ΔF=1/Kp(1/ΔFmax)([FABP]/[SUV])+1/ΔFmaxEq. 2 where ΔF is the difference between the initial fluorescence of AOFA in the FABP and the AOFA fluorescence at a given protein/SUV ratio, and ΔFmax is the maximum difference in AOFA fluorescence. A plot of 1/ΔF versus (1/ΔFmax)([SUV]/[FABP]) gives a slope of 1/Kp. The partition coefficient was used to establish AOFA transfer assay conditions so as to ensure essentially unidirectional transfer, as detailed below (32Roseman M.A. Thompson T.E. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). SUVs were prepared by sonication and ultracentrifugation as described previously (33Huang C. Thompson T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 32: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 34Storch J. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1717-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The standard vesicles were prepared to contain 90 mol % of EPC and 10 mol % of NBD-PC, which served as the fluorescent quencher. To increase the negative charge density of the acceptor vesicles, either 25 mol % of PS or CL were incorporated into the SUVs in place of an equimolar amount of EPC. Vesicles were prepared in TBS buffer except for SUVs containing cardiolipin, which were prepared in TBS with 1 mm EDTA. A fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay was used to monitor the transfer of AOFA from the wild type and mutant IFABPs to acceptor model membranes as described in detail elsewhere (3Hsu K.T. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13317-13323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 4Córsico B. Liou H.L. Storch J.

A. 1998; 95: 12174-12178Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, FABP with bound AOFA was mixed at 25 °C with SUV using a stopped-flow spectrofluorometer DX-17MV (Applied Photophysics Ltd.). The NBD moiety is an energy transfer acceptor of the anthroyloxy group donor; therefore, the fluorescence of the AOFA is quenched when the ligand is bound to SUVs that contain NBD-PC. Upon mixing, transfer of AOFA from protein to membrane is directly monitored by the time-dependent decrease in anthroyloxy group fluorescence. Final transfer assay conditions were 15 μm wild-type or mutant IFABP with 1.5 μm 12AO and a range of 150–600 μm SUV. Controls to ensure that photobleaching was eliminated were performed prior to each experiment, as previously described (8Córsico B. Cistola D.P. Frieden C. Storch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12174-12178Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed using software provided with the instrument, and all curves were well described by a single exponential function. For each experimental condition within a single experiment, at least five replicates were done. Average values ± S.D. for three or more separate experiments are reported, unless otherwise indicated. 125I-TID-PC was prepared by radioiodination of its nonradioactive tin-containing precursor 1-O-hexadecanoyl-2-O-[9-[[[2-(tributylstannyl)-4-(trifluoromethyl-(3H)-diazirin-3-yl)benzyl]oxy]carbonyl]nonanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phospho-choline according to Weber and Brunner (35Weber T. Brunner J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3084-3095Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and our previous work (36Córsico B. Toledo J.D. Garda H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16978-16985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The precursor was generously donated by Prof. J. Brunner from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (Zurich, Switzerland). The dried tin-containing precursor (∼20 nmol) was dissolved in 10 μl of acetic acid in a 1-ml Reacti-Vial (Pierce). [125I]NaI (1 mCi) was added, and the iodination was started by the addition of peracetic acid (2 μl of a 32% solution in acetic acid). After 2 min at room temperature, the reaction was quenched with 50 μlof10%Na2S2O5. Then 40 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1) were added and vortexed. The organic phase was collected and concentrated using a charcoal filter to adsorb volatile radioactivity. The residue was dissolved in 20 μl of methanol/chloroform/H2O (9:1:1) and subjected to reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography using the same solvent and a 208HS54 C8 column (Vydac) in a Merck-Hitachi apparatus with UV detection at 254 nm. The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. 125I-TID-PC eluted at ∼20 min, whereas the excess of tin-containing precursor eluted at ∼40 min. An aliquot (5 μl) of each fraction in the elution region of 125I-TID-PC was analyzed by TLC on silica gel plates (LK6D, 60 Å; Whatman, Clifton, NJ) and subjected to autoradiography. Fractions containing radioactivity were pooled and concentrated by co-evaporation with toluene/ethanol (1:1). 125I-TID-PC was dissolved in ethanol/toluene (1:1) at ∼1 mCi/ml and stored at –20 °C. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) of EPC, EPC/PS (3:1, mol/mol), or EPC/CL (3:1, mol/mol) were prepared (0.5 mm in phospholipids) by extrusion through polycarbonate membranes of 100-nm pore diameter (Avestin Inc., Ottawa, Canada). To prepare the LUVs containing 125I-TID-PC (200 μCi/μmol of phospholipids), the photoreagent was mixed with the lipids in chloroform. Lipids in chloroform were mixed, dried under a stream of N2, and resuspended in 40 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm glutathione (buffer A) by vortexing. Cardiolipin-containing vesicles also had 1 mm EDTA included in the buffer A. Then lipid suspensions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and passed 11 times through the polycarbonate filters using a Liposofast extruder system (Avestin). Experiments were conducted as previously described (36Córsico B. Toledo J.D. Garda H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16978-16985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, 120 μl of 0.5 mm photoreagent-containing LUVs (30 μCi/ml) were incubated with the 60 μg of FABP in 200 μl of buffer A at room temperature for 30 s. In those experiments where oleate was included, we employed a 10:1 protein/ligand (mol/mol) ratio, and the protein-ligand complex was prepared prior to the incubation with LUVs. After the indicated incubation time, mixtures (0.3 ml) in glass cuvettes were irradiated for 30 s with a xenon lamp (450 watts) at a distance of 25 cm. As a control, the photoreagent-containing LUVs were irradiated prior to their mixture with IFABP. After irradiation, 3 volumes of CHCl3/methanol (2:1) were added and vortexed, and the organic phase was discarded. FABPs were precipitated with 5 volumes of acetone and redissolved in 25 μl of sample buffer for direct analysis by SDS-PAGE (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Following Coomassie Blue staining, gels were dried and exposed to X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at –80 °C for different times, depending on the amount of radioactivity. Construction of Mutant Proteins and Comparison of Structural and Ligand-binding Properties with Native IFABP—To examine whether the primary determinant of the IFABP fatty acid transfer mechanism resides in the lysine residues of the helix-turn-helix domain, we undertook the construction of point mutants that neutralized or reversed the charges of the four lysines of the α-helical domain and one of the lysine residues of the β-barrel. To control for potential alterations in the overall folding of the point mutants, molecular modeling, circular dichroism spectroscopy, fluorescence quantum yield measurements of bound anthroyloxy fatty acid, equilibrium binding affinity of oleate using the ADIFAB method, and determination of the relative partition coefficient of 12AO between the IFABPs and SUVs were used. A summary of the results for these experiments is presented in Table 1.TABLE 1Energy minimization and physical and binding parameters of wild-type and mutant IFABPsEnergyApoHoloθ222KdKpQfkcal/moldegrees m-1 cm-1nm[SUV]/[prot]wtIFABP-15,304-12,027-526537 ± 112.5 ± 5.70.08 ± 0.02K16I-15,302-11,934-902645 ± 121.8 ± 5.90.08 ± 0.03K16E-15,418-12,064ND32 ± 613*0.08 ± 0.02K20I-15,227-12,251-766240 ± 718.5 ± 0.70.11 ± 0.04K20E-15,359-12,01"

We suppressed PTHrP expression in MDA-MB-231 cells by RNA interference and analyzed changes in gene expression by microarray analysis. More than 200 genes showed altered expression in response to a PTHrP-specific small interfering (si) RNA (siPTHrP). Cell cycle-regulating gene CDC2 and genes (CDC25B and Tome-1) that control CDC2 activity showed increased expression in the presence of siPTHrP. CDC2 activity was also found to be higher in siPTHrP-treated cells. Studies with PTHrP peptides 1–34 and 67–86, forskolin, and a PTH1 receptor (PTH1R)-specific siRNA showed that PTHrP regulates CDC2 and CDC25B, at least in part, via PTH1R in a cAMP-independent manner. Other siPTHrP-responsive genes included integrin α6 (ITGA6), KISS-1, and PAI-1. When combined, siRNAs against ITGA6, PAI-1, and KISS-1 could mimic the negative effect of siPTHrP on migration, whereas siKISS-1 and siPTHrP similarly reduced the proliferative activity of the cells. Comparative expression analyses with 50 primary breast carcinomas revealed that the RNA level of ITGA6 correlates with that of PTHrP, and higher CDC2 and CDC25B values are found at low PTHrP expression. Our data suggest that PTHrP has a profound effect on gene expression in breast cancer cells and, as a consequence, contributes to the regulation of important cellular activities, such as migration and proliferation.

There are a number of reports suggesting that PTHrP also affects the proliferative and invasive activities of breast cancer cells and regulates their sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli (37Tovar Sepulveda V.A.

Cancer. 2003; 88: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These results have been obtained by treating cells with PTHrP peptides or by overexpressing PTHrP. However, little is known about how suppression of endogenous PTHrP expression affects gene expression and behavior of tumor cells. We chose an RNA interference approach to down-regulate PTHrP expression in invasive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We found that a PTHrP-specific siRNA affected the expression of more than 200 genes, among which are some that play a role in tumor progression. Our data suggest that these genes mediate the effect of PTHrP on cell migration and growth.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines, siRNA, PTHrP Peptides, and Forskolin—MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom). No antibiotics were added. Small interfering RNA (siRNAs) were purchased from MWG Biotec or Dharmacon (Table 1). Cells were transfected by electroporation as described (40Vetter M. Blumenthal S.G. Lindemann R.K. Manns J. Wesselborg S. Thomssen C. Dittmer J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 650-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were trypsinized, washed once with RPMI medium (without serum), and resuspended in RPMI medium at a density of approximately 8 million cells per ml. For each transfection, 250 μl of the cell suspension was mixed with 10–20 μl of an siRNA (250 pmol) stock solution in water or with 10–20 μl of water and electroporated by using a Bio-Rad GenePulserX-Cell (250 V, 800 microfarads). After incubation on ice for 30 min, cells were mixed with 8 ml of growth medium. For RNA or protein isolation, 3 ml of this cell suspension were transferred to a 60-mm cell culture dish (Nunc). Cells were grown for 3 days before harvesting.TABLE 1Primers used for quantitative RT-PCRGeneForward primer (5′ → 3′)Reverse primer (5′ → 3′)CDC2TGGAAACCAGGAAGCCTAGCGAAATTCGTTTGGCTGGATCATCST4GAACAGCCAGAACTGCAGAAGACATTCTGTCCTCCCAGGGAACTNNB1AATCATGCACCTTTGCGTGAGACGTACGGCGCTGGGTATHSPA1AGAGAAGGACGAGTTTGAGCACAATGGTACAGTCCGCTGATGATGITGA6GGCACCTACACTCACCTGCACAGCTAACGTGATGGACGTCTGKISS-1TTTCCTCTGTGCCACCCACAGGGATTCTAGCTGCTGGCCPAI-1GGCCATGGAACAAGGATGAGAGACCAGCTTCAGATCCCGCTPLAUATTCCTGCCAGGGAGACTCAGCCAGTCAAAGTCATGCGGCPTHrP (exon 1C)ACTAACGACCCGCCCTCGGAACAAGTTTCAAGTGCGTGTGTCPTHrP (exon 2)AGGAGGCGGTTAGCCCTGTTCCCATAGCAATGTCTAATTAATCTGGPTHrP (exon 4)ACCTCGGAGGTGTCCCCTAACTCAGACCCAAATCGGACGGPTH1RTGCTCTTCAACTCCTTCCAGGAGCTTGTACCTCGCCATTGC Open table in a new tab To analyze the effect of PTHrP peptides 1–34 and 67–86 (Bachem stock solution, 400 μm in water) on siPTHrP-responsive genes, cells were incubated with 1 μm of the peptide for 18 h. Forskolin was used at final concentration of 2 or 20 μm. Cells were incubated with forskolin for 6 h.Quantitative RT-PCR—Preparation of RNA, cDNA synthesis, and PCR was carried out as described (35Lindemann R.K. Ballschmieter P. Nordheim A. Dittmer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46661-46670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, total RNA was isolated either by using RNeasy (Qiagen) or Nucleospin RNA II (Macherey & Nagel) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For cDNA synthesis, 1 μg of total RNA was mixed with 1 μl of 10mm dNTPs (Eppendorf), 1 μl of RNasin (Promega), and 1 μl of random hexamers or oligo(dT) (Amersham Biosciences) in a total volume of 13 μl and incubated at 65 °C for 5 min and quickly cooled on ice. After addition of 4 μl of 5× strand buffer and 2 μl of 0.1 m DTT, the primers were allowed to anneal to the RNA at 25 °C for 2 min. cDNA synthesis was achieved by addition of 1 μl of Superscript II (200 units/μl; Invitrogen) and sequential incubation at 25 °C for 10 min and at 42 °C for 50 min. The reaction was stopped by keeping the mixture at 70 °C for 15 min. Quantitative PCRs were performed by using ABsolute QPCR SYBR Green Fluorescein mix (ABgene). To 10 μl of SYBR Green mix, 2.5 μl of each primer (5 pmol), 2 μl of cDNA (1:20 diluted), and 3 μl of water were added, and the mixture was run in a Bio-Rad iCycler. After activation of the polymerase at 95 °C for 15 min, 40 cycles were run as follows: denaturing at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and synthesis at 72 °C for 1 min. Each sample was analyzed in duplicate. The results were analyzed by using the iCycler iQ Optical System software version 3.1 (Bio-Rad). The relative RNA level of each gene of interest was calculated by the comparative Ct (2–ΔΔCt) method. GAPDH was used as a reference gene for normalization. The calibrator sample was either the cDNA obtained from cells that were treated with siLuc or with no siRNA. For gene expression comparison in tumor samples, normalized Ct values were used.Except for the CDC25B primers, all primers were purchased from MWG Biotec and are listed in Table 2. The CDC25B primers (QT00028350) were obtained from Qiagen and were used according to the manufacturer's protocol.TABLE 2siRNA sequencessiRNASense strand (5′ → 3′)Anti-sense strand (5′ → 3′)silucCUUACGCUGAGUACUUCGAdTdTUCGAAGUACUCAGCGUAAGdTdTsiElfCACAAUUUAUCUUUGGGAGdTdTCUCCCAAAGAUAAATUGUGdTdTsiPTHrPCUCUUUGUACGUCUCCACCdTdTGGUGGAGACGUACAAAGAGdTdTsiITGA6CCAUCACAGUAACUCCUAAdTdTUUAGGAGUUACUGAGAUGGdTdTsiPAI1UGACCGACAUGUUCAGACAdTdTUGUCUGAACAUGUCGGUCAdTdTsiKISS1CUACAACUGGAACUCCUUCdTdTGAAGGAGUUCCAGUUGUAGdTdTsiPrecGUCCAGAUGCACUAUGAGAdTdTUCUCAUAGUGCAUCUGGACdTdT Open table in a new tab Microarrays—For microarray analyses, Affymetrix probe array type HG-U133A was used. The analyses were carried out as described (40Vetter M. Blumenthal S.G. Lindemann R.K. Manns J. Wesselborg S. Thomssen C. Dittmer J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 650-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For preparation of biotin-labeled cRNA and hybridization, the manufacturer's protocol was strictly followed. Briefly, 1–8 μg of total RNA was first reverse-transcribed by using a T7-oligo(dT) promoter primer in the first-strand cDNA synthesis reaction. Following RNase H-mediated second-strand cDNA synthesis, the double-stranded cDNA was purified and transcripted into cRNA in the presence of T7 RNA polymerase and a biotinylated nucleotide analog/ribonucleotide mixture. The biotinylated cRNAs were then cleaned up and fragmented. The fragmented, biotinylated cRNA (50 ng/μl) was hybridized to an HG-U133A GeneChip expression array in hybridization buffer (100 mm MES, 1 m NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 0.01% Tween 20) containing 50 pm of a control oligonucleotide, 0.1 mg/ml herring sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% dimethyl sulfoxide for 16 h at 45 °C. After stringent washings, hybridized biotinylated cRNAs were detected by streptavidin-phycoerythrin. Microarray analyses were performed with RNAs from three independent sets of transient transfection experiments. Only those genes that showed a detection p value of less than 0.05 (one-sided Wilcoxon's rank test) and whose expression was similarly changed in all three comparative analyses (p < 0.05, t test) were considered to be siPTHrP-responsive genes.Protein Extraction, Western Blot Analyses, uPA/PAI-ELISA, and Antibodies—Transfected cells grown for 3 days in a 60-mm plate were scraped off the plate and harvested by centrifugation. For extraction of cytosolic proteins, cells were resuspended in 150 μl of 250 mm Tris ·HCl (pH 7.5) and lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at full speed for 10 min at 4 °C. Nuclear protein extraction was done as described (35Lindemann R.K. Ballschmieter P. Nordheim A. Dittmer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46661-46670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, after harvest, cells were resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm DTT) and kept on ice for 15 min. After addition of 25 μl of Nonidet P-40, the cell suspension was vortexed for 10 s and centrifuged for 30 s in a microcentrifuge at full speed. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT) and rocked for 15 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 10 min, the supernatant was collected and stored at –80 °C. Extraction of plasma membrane proteins was carried out as described (41Guerra L. Fanelli T. Favia M. Riccardi S.M. Busco G. Cardone R.A. Carrabino S. Weinman E.J. Reshkin S.J. Conese M. Casavola V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40925-40933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were resuspended in buffer A as described above and homogenized by five passes through a 20-gauge needle. The supernatant was stepwise centrifuged at 3000 (600 × g) and 6500 rpm (3500 × g) and then full speed in a microcentrifuge for 10 min each. The pellets after the first two centrifugations were discarded. The pellet of the last centrifugation contains the plasma membrane proteins and was dissolved in buffer D (5 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm K-EDTA (pH 7.2), 1 mm DTT).Western blot analysis was performed as described (35Lindemann R.K. Ballschmieter P. Nordheim A. Dittmer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46661-46670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, proteins were separated in a 10% gel by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin (fraction V; AppliChem) in washing buffer (10 mm Tris ·HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) for 20 min at room temperature, the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody in washing buffer containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. In the case of the anti-CTNNB1 antibody, incubation was done overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed three times in washing buffer plus Tween 20 for 5 min each and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling or Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature followed by three washes in washing buffer plus Tween 20 for 20 min each. Peroxidase activity was visualized by chemiluminescence using ECL-Plus (Amersham Biosciences) followed by exposure to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognizing CDC2, phospho-Tyr-15-CDC2, ERK1/2, phospho-Thr-202/Tyr-204-ERK1/2, and anti-rabbit peroxidase conjugates were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (dilution 1:1000 each). Murine anti-CT-NNB1 (1:2000) was from BD Transduction Laboratories. Anti-GAPDH (1:10,000; Ambion) was used to check for equal loading of cytosolic and nuclear proteins (42Dittmer A. Dittmer J. Electrophoresis. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 43Kodama R. Kondo T. Yokote H. Jing X. Sawada T. Hironishi M. Sakaguchi K. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For detection of uPA and PAI-1, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used (Femtelle uPA/PAI-1 test; American Diagnostica). One hundred μl of the 10–300-fold diluted extracts or medium was used per well of a 96-well ELISA plate coated either with anti-uPA or anti-PAI-1. Binding of uPA or PAI-1 to its corresponding antibody was detected by an antibody-peroxidase conjugate followed by colorimetric measurement in a Spectra Fluor ELISA reader (Tecan). Total protein was measured by using either the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) or the BCA assay (Pierce).Migration and Invasion Assays—For wound healing assays, cells transfected with siRNA were grown on 60-mm plates for 3 days before a gap was introduced into the monolayer cells by dragging a yellow tip across the cell surface. The phase contrast images of the wounds were recorded after 0, 24, and 48 h, and the wound closure was evaluated by measuring the width of the remaining wound. Cell migration was also studied by seeding transfected cells (2 × 105) on a tissue culture insert (pore size, 8 μm; ThinCerts, Greiner Bio-One) inserted into a well of a 6-well plate and allowing them to migrate through the pores. After 48 h, the number of cells on the underside of the insert was determined by microscopic counting (15 fields/insert). For analyzing invasion, Matrigel invasion chambers (BD Biosciences) were used instead. The percentage of invasive cells was determined by comparing the number of cells that were able to pass Matrigel with those that migrated through the pores in the absence of Matrigel.Measurement of Proliferation—To measure cell growth, 5 × 103 or 104 siRNA-transfected cells were seeded to each well of a 24-well plate and incubated for 3 days. Cell layers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and adherent cells were lysed in 200 μl of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ELISA lysis buffer (Roche Applied Science) supplemented with 0.25% SDS. After 10 min of incubation, the lysate was transferred to a microtube and centrifuged for 10 min at full speed. The protein contents of the samples were determined by a BCA protein assay (Pierce) by following the instructions of the manufacturer. The protein content was used as a representative measure of the cell number. To determine the rate of DNA synthesis, siRNA-transfected cells (initial cell number, 5 × 103 /well) were grown in a 24-well plate for 3 days after which the medium was replaced by 250 μl of fresh medium/serum supplemented with 10 μm 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd). After incubation for 2.5 h, cells were lysed and treated with nuclease, and BrdUrd was detected by anti-BrdUrd peroxidase conjugate essentially as described in the manufacturer's protocol (BrdUrd labeling and detection kit III; Roche Applied Science).Breast Cancer Biopsies—Fifty tumor samples from patients with unilateral operable breast cancer who underwent resection of their primary tumor between 1987 and 1997 were selected by availability of frozen tissue in the tumor bank at the Department of Chemical Endocrinology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre (The Netherlands). Breast cancer biopsies were pulverized under liquid nitrogen, and total RNA was isolated for cDNA synthesis and quantitative RT-PCR. To compare the expression of PTHrP with that of various siPTHrP-responsive genes, Spearman rank correlations were calculated by using SPSS 11.5 software.RESULTSPTHrP-specific siRNA Down-regulates PTHrP in MDA-MB-231 Cells—In order to identify genes that are regulated by PTHrP in invasive breast cancer cells, we designed a PTHrP-specific siRNA (siPTHrP) to specifically down-regulate PTHrP expression. To confirm that PTHrP expression was suppressed, we performed quantitative RT-PCR. We used PTHrP exon 4-specific primers that are capable of recognizing all PTHrP transcripts. The study was carried out with the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line, which is known to produce and secrete PTHrP (34Yin J.J. Selander K. Chirgwin J.M. Dallas M. Grubbs B.G. Wieser R. Massague J.

In contrast, control siRNAs (siLuc, siElf1) had no effect on PTHrP expression.In the Presence of siPTHrP the Expression of More than 200 Genes Is Changed—To study the effect of siPTHrP on gene expression in MDA-MB-231 cells, microarrays analyses by using Affymetrix HG-U133A gene chips were carried out. The RNAs derived from cells treated with siPTHrP or siLuc in three independent transfection experiments were analyzed. The data are deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus as series GSE4292. Of the 44,928 genes and ESTs present on the chip, more than 200 genes were found to have altered expression in the presence of siPTHrP versus siLuc (p < 0.05; t test) (supplemental Table 3). Although statistically significant, many siPTHrP-induced changes in expression were in the range of 3-fold or less, and in some cases, variations between individual measurements were large. Among the genes that responded to siPTHrP were four annexin genes and four metallothionein genes. In addition, many genes involved in ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation were affected by siPTHrP. Furthermore, the expression of four cell cycle-regulating genes (CDC2, CDC25B, GRCC8, and CKS2) were induced by siPTHrP. Interestingly, three of these genes (CDC2, CDC25B, and GRCC8) are important for G2/M transition. CDC2 (CDK1) forms complexes with cyclin B to initiate entry to mitosis (46Doree M. Hunt T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2461-2464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More importantly, CDC2 is overexpressed in many breast cancer cells (47Keyomarsi K. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1112-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). CDC25B (cell division cycle 25B) activates the CDC2-cyclin B complex by dephosphorylating CDC2 (48Lim H.H. Surana U. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W1988230958,"As nascent polypeptides exit the ribosomal tunnel they immediately associate with chaperones, folding catalysts, and targeting factors. These interactions are decisive for the future conformation and destination of the protein that is being synthesized. Using Escherichia coli as a model organism, we have systematically analyzed how the earliest contacts of nascent polypeptides with cytosolic factors depend on the nature and future destination of the emerging sequence using a photo cross-linking approach. Together, the data suggest that the chaperone trigger factor is adjacent to emerging sequences by default, consistent with both its placement near the nascent chain exit site and its cellular abundance. The signal recognition particle (SRP) effectively competes the contact with TF when a signal anchor (SA) sequence of a nascent inner membrane protein appears outside the ribosome. The SRP remains in contact with the SA and downstream sequences during further synthesis of ∼30 amino acids. The contact with trigger factor is then restored unless another transmembrane segment reinitiates SRP binding. Importantly and in contrast to published data, the SRP appears perfectly capable of distinguishing SA sequences from signal sequences in secretory proteins at this early stage in biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2084429681,"Nrf2 is a transcription factor that regulates important antioxidant and phase II detoxification genes. Arachidonic acid (AA) causes CYP2E1-dependent toxicity in HepG2 cells. The ability of Nrf2 to protect against CYP2E1-dependent AA toxicity and its possible mechanism were evaluated. AA activates Nrf2 in CYP2E1-expressing HepG2 cells (E47 cells), increasing Nrf2 protein and mRNA levels, Nrf2 nuclear translocation, and Nrf2-ARE binding activity. These increases in Nrf2 are associated with elevated expression of Nrf2-regulated antioxidant genes. Overexpression of Nrf2 by transient transfection of plasmid Nrf2 confers resistance of E47 cells against AA toxicity. Blocking Nrf2 with small interfering RNA (siRNA)-Nrf2 potentiates the CYP2E1-dependent AA toxicity. This enhanced toxicity is accompanied by decreases of cellular GSH levels and increases in production of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation. There is also a potentiation of mitochondrial damage in the presence of siRNA-Nrf2. The protective effects of Nrf2 against CYP2E1-dependent toxicity can be blocked by l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine, a specific inhibitor of glutamate-cysteine ligase, which is a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of GSH and is regulated by Nrf2. Elevation of GSH by supplementing with glutathione ethyl ester can partially reverse the enhanced AA toxicity by siRNA-Nrf2. Moreover, in contrast to AA, l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine toxicity is not prevented by plasmid Nrf2 probably because protective GSH cannot be synthesized. Together, these results suggest that Nrf2, through up-regulation of glutamate-cysteine ligase and increase of GSH levels, protects against CYP2E1-dependent AA toxicity.

Galleano M. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14532-14541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). AA also induces toxicity in pyrazole-induced rat hepatocytes with high levels of CYP2E1 but not in saline control hepatocytes (10Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 204: 157-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This CYP2E1-dependent AA toxicity is prevented by inhibitors of CYP2E1 and by antioxidants (9Chen Q. Galleano M. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14532-14541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 10Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 204: 157-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several genes encoding detoxifying and antioxidative stress enzymes are coordinately induced on exposure to electrophiles and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (11Talalay P. Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2003; 43: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 12Primiano T. Sutter T.R. Kensler T.W. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 38: 293-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This coordinated response is regulated through a cis-acting element called the antioxidant-responsive element (ARE) within the regulatory region of target genes (13Friling R.S. Bensimon A. Daniel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6258-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 14Rushmore T.H. Morton M.R. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11632-11639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genes encoding a subset of drug-metabolizing enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) (13Friling R.S. Bensimon A. Daniel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6258-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) and NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) (14Rushmore T.H. Morton M.R. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11632-11639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been shown to be under ARE regulation along with a subset of antioxidant genes such as heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) (15Alam J. Camhi S. Choi A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11977-11984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) (16Mulcahy R.T. Wartman M.A. Bailey H.H. Gipp J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7445-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The signaling system leading to ARE activation has been partly elucidated, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is identified as the key transcriptional factor that transmits the inducer signal to ARE (17Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Pickett C.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 233-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Nrf2 is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (18Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2739) Google Scholar). After activation, it dissociates from Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 and translocates into the nucleus, where it complexes with other nuclear factors, binds to ARE, and activates transcription of many antioxidant genes and phase II detoxification genes, which have ARE elements in their promoter regions (17Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Pickett C.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 233-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Nrf2 is constitutively and ubiquitously expressed in a number of tissues and cell lines and is responsible for the low level expression of its target genes observed under physiological conditions. However, in cells exposed to oxidative stress, Nrf2 activity is increased, further driving the transcriptional activation of genes, the expression of which is essential to protect cells against loss of viability (19Nguyen T. Yang C.S. Pickett C.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The goal of the current study was to evaluate whether Nrf2 may offer protection against AA plus CYP2E1-dependent toxicity and, if so, to assess possible mechanisms involved in the protection. Nrf2 levels in E47 cells were enhanced by transfection with plasmid expressing Nrf2 or decreased by siRNA-Nrf2 treatment. The consequences of modulating cellular Nrf2 levels on AA-induced oxidative stress and E47 cell viability were determined. Cell Culture and Transfection Experiments—HepG2 cells that constitutively express CYP2E1 (E47 cells) or control HepG2 cells (C34 cells), 4HepG2 cell line was established after transfection with pCI-neo. which have undetectable P450 activity (20Chen Q. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), were cultured in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5 mg/ml G418 supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine in a humidified atmosphere in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were plated and incubated in minimal essential medium overnight, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium, and the different treatments were initiated. siRNA-Nrf2 and siRNA-control (a nontargeting siRNA) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were transfected using the siRNA transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Plasmid pEF/Nrf2 and pEF (21Alam J. Wicks C. Stewart D. Gong P. Touchard C. Otterbein S. Choi A.M. Burow M.E. Tou J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27694-27702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). General Methodology—Cell viability was measured by an MTT assay (20Chen Q. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). ROS were determined by flow cytometry with 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (22Gong P. Cederbaum A.I. Nieto N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29693-29700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Lipid peroxidation was determined by measuring the concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) in cell lysates (23Fraga C.G. Leibovitz B.E. Tappel A.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1987; 3: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). GSH was determined as described previously (24Mari M. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15563-15571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial membrane potential was analyzed by flow cytometry after double staining with 5 μg/ml rhodamine 123 (Rh123) and 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) (25Bai J. Rodriguez A.M. Melendez J.A.

C57BL6 Nrf2(–/–) mice were obtained from Dr. Masayuki Yamamoto (University of Tsukuba), and wild type C57BL6 mice were purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratories (Boston, MA). Activity of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was assayed using the diagnostic kits (Thermo Electron, Louisville, CO). Western Blotting—Nrf2, the catalytic subunit of GCL (GCLC), HO-1, and β-actin proteins were detected by Western blotting (26Gong P. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 2006; 43: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Sample proteins from whole cell lysates (50 μg), cytoplasm (100 μg), or nuclear extracts (25 μg) were loaded on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes. Protein concentration was determined using the protein DC-20 assay kit (Bio-Rad). Protein immunoblot analysis was carried out using the following, anti-human HO-1 (1:5000) monoclonal antibody (StressGen Biotech), anti-human Nrf2 (1:5000) polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-human GCLC (1:500) polyclonal antibody (Lab Vision Corp.), and anti-human β-actin (1:10,000) monoclonal antibody (Sigma) as primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:4000) or goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000) (Sigma) as secondary antibody. Blots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence immunoblot-detecting reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Northern Blotting—Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 10 μg of RNA was electrophoresed under denaturing conditions in 0.9% agarose-formaldehyde gels, transferred onto nylon membranes, and hybridized to random-primed 32P-labeled Nrf2, GCLC, HO-1, or GAPDH cDNA probes (22Gong P. Cederbaum A.I. Nieto N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29693-29700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The mouse Nrf2 cDNA was produced by digesting the plasmid pEF/Nrf2 (21Alam J. Wicks C. Stewart D. Gong P. Touchard C. Otterbein S. Choi A.M. Burow M.E. Tou J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27694-27702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) with NotI and BglII. The human HO-1 cDNA was produced by digesting the plasmid pHHO1 (22Gong P. Cederbaum A.I. Nieto N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29693-29700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with XhoI and XbaI. The human GCLC cDNA and the human GAPDH cDNA were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Crude nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (27Gong P. Ogra Y. Koizumi S. Ind. Health. 2000; 38: 224-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The standard binding reaction mixture (12.5 μl) contained 18 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 80 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 160 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 20,000 cpm [γ-32P]ATP-labeled probe, and 2 μg of nuclear extract. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 20 min and analyzed by native 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as described previously (28Gong P. Stewar D. Hu B. Vinson C. Alam J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 405: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to a GCLC ARE (5′-GCGCGCGCACCGCCTCCGTGACTCAGCGCTTTGTGCG-3′, core ARE sequence underlined) was used as probe. In supershift assays, 1 μl of preimmune IgG or anti-Nrf2 antibody was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 20 min at room temperature prior to electrophoresis. Statistics—Student's t test for unpaired data was used to evaluate the differences between the compared groups. siRNA-Nrf2 Potentiates the Toxicity Caused by AA in E47 Cells—The ability of AA and l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO) (Sigma) to cause CYP2E1-dependent toxicities has been documented in previous studies (29Cederbaum A.I. Wu D. Mari M. Bai J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1539-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To study whether Nrf2 protects HepG2 cells from CYP2E1-dependent toxicity, HepG2 cells that express CYP2E1 (E47 cells) and HepG2 cells that do not express CYP2E1 (C34 cells) were used. AA and BSO cause toxicity in E47 cells but not in C34 cells (29Cederbaum A.I. Wu D. Mari M. Bai J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1539-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Blocking Nrf2 by siRNA-Nrf2 alone did not cause toxicity in C34 cells (Fig. 1A) but did cause a mild toxicity in E47 cells (Fig. 1B) (cell viability 80 ± 7.0%, p < 0.05). AA and BSO treatments did not affect cell viability of C34 cells transfected with siRNA-control (Fig. 1A) but caused moderate toxicity in E47 cells transfected with siRNA-control (Fig. 1B). Blocking Nrf2 by siRNA-Nrf2 did not significantly affect cell viability of C34 cells treated with AA but decreased cell viability of C34 cells treated with BSO (Fig. 1A). siRNA-Nrf2 dramatically enhanced the toxicity of AA and BSO in E47 cells, as cell viability decreased from 62.5 ± 8.5% to 10.7 ± 1.2% and from 63.5 ± 6.8% to 7.9 ± 0.9%, respectively (Fig. 1B). Morphological changes of E47 cells after treatment of AA are shown in Fig. 2. After AA treatment, most of the E47 cells transfected with siRNA-Nrf2 were swollen or dead and floated to the top (Fig. 2, arrows). In comparison only a few E47 cells transfected with siRNA-control and treated with AA were swollen (Fig. 2, arrows).FIGURE 2Morphological changes of E47 cells treated with AA. E47 cells (5 × 104 cells/well) were grown on 24-well plates overnight. After changing the medium, cells were transiently transfected with siRNA-control and siRNA-Nrf2. Thirty hours after transfection, cells were further incubated with or without 50 μm AA for 24 h. Cell morphology was visualized under a light microscope (×400 magnification).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) siRNA-Nrf2 Enhances the Decrease of GSH and Increase of ROS and Lipid Peroxidation of E47 Cells Treated with AA—To study whether the enhanced AA toxicity produced by siRNA-Nrf2 involved oxidative stress, the effects of siRNA-Nrf2 on the cellular GSH level, ROS production, and lipid peroxidation after AA treatment were assayed. E47 cells transfected with siRNA-Nrf2 or siRNA-control were incubated with or without 50 μm AA for 24 h. After incubation, cells were collected, and GSH, ROS, and TBARS were determined. AA treatment decreased the GSH level (Fig. 3A) of E47 cells transfected with siRNA-control and increased the levels of ROS (Fig. 3B) and TBARS (Fig. 3C). Blocking Nrf2 with siRNA-Nrf2 significantly enhanced these changes, as ROS level further increased from 170 ± 18 to 325 ± 29 arbitrary units/mg protein, TBARS increased from 1.5 ± 0.2 to 3.2 ± 0.4 nmol/mg protein, and GSH levels further declined from 6.5 ± 0.7 to 3.2 ± 0.3 nmol/mg protein (Fig. 3). Even in the absence of AA, the siRNA-Nrf2 produced a decrease in cellular GSH and modest increases in ROS production and TBARS formation. siRNA-Nrf2 Enhances the Decline of Mitochondrial Potential Caused by AA in E47 Cells—Damage to the mitochondria is a key target in the AA plus CYP2E1-dependent toxicity (25Bai J. Rodriguez A.M. Melendez J.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 30Gong P. Cederbaum A.I. Nieto N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial membrane potential was assayed by flow cytometry after double staining with Rh123 and PI. Rh123 uptake into the mitochondria is proportional to the mitochondrial membrane potential. PI diffuses into the cells and binds to cellular DNA when the integrity of the plasma membrane is lost. As shown in Fig. 4, most of the E47 cells transfected with siRNA-control appear on the low PI and high Rh123-fluorescence field (lower right quadrant), indicative of intact, viable cells with high mitochondrial membrane potential. AA treatment decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential, and the number of cells in the lower left quadrant (M1 zone) increased from 3.82 ± 0.28% to 19.52 ± 2.83% in E47 cells transfected with siRNA-control (Fig. 4). siRNA-Nrf2 itself also caused some decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential (the number of cells in the M1 zone increased from 3.82 ± 0.28% to 15.82 ± 2.67%). The largest decline in mitochondrial membrane potential was found in E47 cells transfected with siRNA-Nrf2 and treated with AA as the number of cells in the M1 zone increased to 38.82 ± 3.86% (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4). AA Treatment Increases Nrf2 Nuclear Translocation and ARE Binding Activity—To study whether AA treatment can activate Nrf2, we examined the Nrf2 protein nuclear translocation and Nrf2-ARE binding activity in E47 cells. Fig. 5A shows that the level of Nrf2 protein in the nuclei of E47 cells was significantly increased, whereas Nrf2 protein in the cytoplasm was significantly decreased after AA treatment, suggesting the translocation of Nrf2 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. To determine whether Nrf2 binding activity to the ARE was affected by AA, nuclear extracts of E47 cells were prepared, and Nrf2 binding activity was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay with a double strand DNA containing the ARE sequence as probe. ARE binding activity was increased after AA treatment compared with untreated control E47 cells. Nrf2 antibody can supershift this complex (Fig. 5B), indicating that it contains Nrf2. Together, these results suggest that Nrf2 is activated by AA treatment in E47 cells. siRNA-Nrf2 Blocks the Antioxidant Gene (GCLC and HO-1) Response Caused by AA in E47 Cells—GCL and HO-1 are important antioxidant genes regulated by Nrf2 (15Alam J. Camhi S. Choi A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11977-11984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 16Mulcahy R.T. Wartman M.A. Bailey H.H. Gipp J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7445-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). To determine possible changes of these genes after AA treatment, both mRNA and protein expression of Nrf2, HO-1, and GCLC were studied. E47 cells were grown overnight, the medium was changed, and cells were further incubated with or without 50 μm AA for 24 h. Cells were collected; Nrf2, GCLC, HO-1, and β-actin proteins were determined by Western blot, and Nrf2, GCLC, HO-1, and GAPDH mRNA levels were detected by Northern blot. In the untreated E47 cells, siRNA-Nrf2 decreased Nrf2, GCLC, and HO-1 basal mRNA and protein expression levels (Fig. 6, A and B), validating the effectiveness of the siRNA in decreasing Nrf2 and its antioxidant-responsive genes. AA treatment increased the Nrf2 mRNA and protein level as well as GCLC and HO-1 mRNA and protein levels in E47 cells transfected with siRNA-control. siRNA-Nrf2 blocked this response of E47 cells to AA treatment, as Nrf2, GCLC, and HO-1 mRNA and protein levels in E47 cells transfected with siRNA-Nrf2 were all lower than E47 cells transfected with siRNA-control in response to AA treatment (Fig. 6, A and B). We believe that the increase in Nrf2 protein levels reflects an adaption by the E47 cells to the increased oxidative stress produced by AA in the E47 cells. If so, antioxidants should prevent the AA-induced increase in Nrf2 protein levels. Fig. 6C shows that treatment with 50 μm α-tocopherol or 2 mm glutathione ethyl ester or 5 mm N-acetylcysteine indeed lowers the AA-induced levels of Nrf2 protein to the basal levels found in the absence of AA. Overexpression of Nrf2 Confers E47 Cell Resistance to AA Toxicity—To confirm the protective effects of Nrf2 against AA toxicity in E47 cells, E47 cells were transiently transfected with pEF/Nrf2 or an empty plasmid vector pEF as control. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were incubated with or without 50 μm AA for 48 h. Cell viability was determined by an MTT assay. E47 cells transfected with pEF/Nrf2 had higher levels of Nrf2 as well as GCLC and HO-1 protein expression compared with E47 cells transfected with the control vector plasmid (Fig. 7A). Cell viability of E47 cells transfected with pEF was decreased about 50% by AA treatment and 75% by treatment with BSO. Overexpressing Nrf2 by pEF/Nrf2 transfection protected E47 cells against AA toxicity, as cell viability increased from 50% to about 80% (Fig. 7B). However, BSO toxicity was not prevented by pEF/Nrf2 (Fig. 7B). The GCL Inhibitor BSO Blocks the Protective Effects of Overexpression of Nrf2 on AA Toxicity—Many phase II enzymes such as NQO1 and GST and antioxidant genes like GCL and HO-1 are regulated by Nrf2 (13Friling R.S. Bensimon A. Daniel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6258-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 14Rushmore T.H. Morton M.R. Pickett C.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7445-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). To evaluate Nrf2-dependent genes that play an important role in the protection against AA toxicity, specific inhibitors of GCL (BSO), HO-1 (chromium mesoporphyrin (CrMP); Porphyrin Products Inc.), NQO1 (dicumarol (DI); Sigma), and GST (Cibacron blue (CB); Biovision) were used to block the activity of these enzymes. E47 cells (5 × 104 cells/well) were grown on 24-well plates overnight. After changing the medium, cells were transiently transfected with plasmid pEF or pEF/Nrf2. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were further incubated with 50 μm AA for 24 h in the absence or presence of BSO (100 μm), CrMP (20 μm), DI (50 μm), or CB (5 μm), which was added into the culture medium 1 h before addition of AA. Only the GCL inhibitor BSO blocked the protective effects of overexpression of Nrf2 against AA toxicity, suggesting that GCL plays a key role in this protection (Fig. 8). The HO-1 inhibitor CrMP, NQO1 inhibitor DI, and GST inhibitor CB did not prevent the protection by Nrf2 (Fig. 8), suggesting that HO-1, NQO1, and GST may not be important in mediating the Nrf2 protection. In the pEF transfected cells, BSO and CrMP but not DI or CB enhanced the toxicity of AA (Fig. 8). siRNA-Nrf2-enhanced AA Toxicity Can Be Reversed by Supplementation of GSH through GSSE—GCL is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of GSH. To further prove the protective effects of GCL and GSH, exogenous GSH was supplied by addition of 2 mm GSSE to the culture medium. E47 cells (5 × 104 cells/well) were grown on 24-well plates overnight. After changing the medium, cells were transiently transfected with siRNA-control and siRNA-Nrf2. Thirty hours after transfection, cells were further incubated with or without 50 μm AA for 24 h. GSSE was added 1 h before addition of AA. Cell viability was determined by an MTT assay. The results showed that the toxicity of siRNA-Nrf2 plus AA was partially reversed by addition of GSSE (Fig. 9). The small amount of toxicity caused by the siRNA-Nrf2 alone in E47 cells was also abolished by addition of GSSE (Fig. 9). Induction of CYP2E1 by Pyrazole Increases Serum ALT Level in Nrf2 Knock-out Mice—To induce liver CYP2E1 levels, Nrf2(–/–) and wild type Nrf2(+/+) mice (18–22 g) were injected with pyrazole (intraperitoneally, 150 mg/kg) once a day for 2 days. After treatment, blood samples were collected, and serum ALT activity was determined. Induction of CYP2E1 by pyrazole in Nrf2(–/–) mice caused a significant increase of serum ALT levels. However, the pyrazole treatment had no effect in wild type Nrf2(+/+) mice (Fig. 10). Nrf2 levels were previously found to be increased in livers from rats chronically fed with ethanol and rats treated with pyrazole, an inducer of CYP2E1 (26Gong P. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 2006; 43: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The functional significance of this increase is not clear. CYP2E1-dependent AA toxicity in E47 cells has been characterized in previous studies (29Cederbaum A.I. Wu D. Mari M. Bai J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1539-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that the transcription factor Nrf2 is important in protecting E47 cells against AA toxicity. Overexpression of Nrf2 confers resistance of E47 cells to AA toxicity. Blocking Nrf2 by siRNA-Nrf2 significantly increases the AA toxicity to E47 cells. Blocking Nrf2 enhances the decrease of the cellular GSH level and increases the production of ROS and lipid peroxidation in E47 cells after AA treatment. These changes caused by siRNA-Nrf2 further enhance the mitochondrial damage caused by AA, which leads to the dramatic increase in cell death. Nrf2 is activated by AA in E47 cells. After AA treatment, total levels of Nrf2 protein and mRNA are increased. The Nrf2 protein in the cytoplasm is translocated into the nucleus, and Nrf2-ARE binding activity is significantly increased. More important, Nrf2-regulated genes HO-1 and GCLC are up-regulated by AA. Activation of Nrf2 by AA may be an adaptive response to the increased oxidative stress caused by AA in E47 cells because AA treatment causes significant increases of ROS and lipid peroxidation in these cells. Moreover, treatment with antioxidants lowers these elevated levels of Nrf2. The protective effects of Nrf2 against CYP2E1-dependent AA toxicity may be mediated by the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant genes. The antioxidant genes GCL and HO-1 and phase II enzymes NQO1 and GST are all regulated by Nrf2 (13Friling R.S. Bensimon A. Daniel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6258-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 14Rushmore T.H. Morton M.R. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11632-11639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Alam J. Camhi S. Choi A.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7445-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). GCLC and HO-1 gene expressions are increased by AA treatment in E47 cells. The up-regulation of these antioxidant genes by AA is Nrf2-dependent because overexpression of Nrf2 increases GCLC and HO-1 expression, and blocking Nrf2 with siRNA-Nrf2 also blocks the increased expression of these genes by AA. E47 cells overexpressing Nrf2 are more resistant to AA toxicity. This protection of Nrf2 is blocked only by BSO, the specific inhibitor of GCL, suggesting that GCL plays an important role in mediating the protection by Nrf2. Although the antioxidant gene HO-1 has been shown to be protective against CYP2E1-dependent toxicity (30Gong P. Cederbaum A.I. Nieto N. Free Radic. Biol.

Phase II enzymes NQO1 and GST do not play an important role in mediating Nrf2 protection against AA because specific inhibitors of these enzymes did not show any effect on the protective action of Nrf2 against AA toxicity. GSH may play a key role in the protective effects of Nrf2 against AA toxicity in E47 cells. BSO, the specific inhibitor of GCL, reduces the cellular GSH level. Overexpression of Nrf2 protects E47 cells against AA but not BSO toxicity. GSH cannot be synthesized in the presence of BSO. Moreover, this protection of Nrf2 against AA toxicity is blocked by BSO, an inhibitor of GCL. GCL is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of GSH. Increasing GSH by addition of GSSE reversed the toxicity of siRNA-Nrf2 itself in E47 cells as well as the enhanced AA toxicity by siRNA-Nrf2. Together, these results suggest that GSH level may play a key role in the protective effect of Nrf2 against CYP2E1-dependent AA toxicity. By analogy, activation of Nrf2 and increased production of GSH may be important in protecting against toxicity caused by various chemicals metabolized by CYP2E1 to reactive toxic species, e.g. acetaminophen, CCl4, benzene, and nitrosamines (31Guengerich F.P.

The apparent efficacies of the analogs were inversely related to their potencies and were independent of the nature of the modifications in TRH structure. In studies in intact cells, we showed that the differences in apparent efficacies were not due to differences in G-protein coupling, receptor desensitization, or recycling. Moreover, the differences in efficacies persisted in experiments using accessory protein-free membranes. We conclude that the efficacy differences of TRH analogs originated from the enhanced ability of TRH-R complexed to the low affinity agonists to directly activate G-protein(s), and not by a modulation of the activity of accessory proteins, and propose possible mechanisms for this phenomenon.

TRH-Rs couple primarily to the Gq/11 subfamily of G-proteins and mediate the intracellular release of Ca2+ through the activation of the inositol phosphate (IP) pathway (1Gershengorn M.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 553: 191-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are two subtypes of TRH-Rs, TRH-R1 and TRH-R2, that share about 50% sequence homology (2Sun Y. Lu X. Gershengorn M.C. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 30: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 3O'Dowd B.F. Lee D.K. Huang W. Nguyen T. Cheng R. Liu Y. Wang B. Gershengorn M.C. George S.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of the existence of two kinds of TRH-Rs remains unknown. TRH-R1 and TRH-R2 exhibit subtle functional differences varying in the level of stimulated and basal signaling, the rate of internalization, and the ability to couple to G-proteins other than Gq/11 (2Sun Y. Lu X. Gershengorn M.C. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 30: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 3O'Dowd B.F. Lee D.K. Huang W. Nguyen T. Cheng R. Liu Y. Wang B. Gershengorn M.C. George S.R.

The ligand binding affinities of TRH analogs to the two receptors, however, are very similar (2Sun Y. Lu X. Gershengorn M.C. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 30: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). TRH is the natural agonist for both TRH-Rs, and numerous synthetic analogs of TRH have been shown to stimulate both receptors (2Sun Y. Lu X. Gershengorn M.C. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 30: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Except for substitution of His by 1-methyl-His, all substitutions within TRH result in analogs with reduced affinities, but all are agonists. The nature of the molecular changes that are responsible for TRH-R activation remain mainly unknown. The absence of a working hypothesis for the mechanism of TRH-R activation precludes the use of a rational approach to develop new agonists for these receptors. Therefore, study of structure-activity relationships of the known TRH-R1/R2 agonists may contribute to a better understanding of the structural basis of the efficacies of TRH-R-agonist complexes, which is necessary for development of more efficient (specific) modulators of TRH-R activity. In this work, we demonstrate a unique pharmacological profile of a series of TRH analogs in which affinities (potencies) of the compounds are related in an inverse mode to their ability to activate TRH-R1/R2. A corollary of these observations is that certain TRH analogs act as “super-agonists” for TRH-R1/R2. We propose possible mechanisms for this effect. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum were purchased from BIOSOURCE (Rockville, MD). TRH (pGlu-His-ProNH2), MeTRH (pGlu-His(1(τ)-methyl)-ProNH2), luciferin, pertussis toxin, and ammonium chloride were purchased from Sigma. Folimycin (concanamycin A), okadaic acid, Ro-31-8425 (2-[8-(aminomethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydropyrido[1,2-a]indol-3-yl]-3-(1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)maleimide, HCl), and HA-1077 (1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-homopiperazine) were purchased from (Calbiochem). TRH-Gly (pGlu-His-Pro-GlyOH) and Phe2-TRH (pGlu-Phe-ProNH2) were obtained from Bachem (Torrance, CA). TRH analogs NP 654 (pGlu-His(1-isopropyl)-ProNH2), 3N. Kaur, V. Monga, J. S. Josan, and R.

Singh J. Perlman J.H. Gershengorn M.C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2002; 10: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). [3H]MeTRH and [35S]GTPγS were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. myo-[3H]Inositol was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The cDNA clone for human Gαq was obtained from the University of Missouri-Rolla(UMR) cDNA Resource Center. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were seeded in 24-well plates (75 × 103 cells/well) 1 day before transfection. For luciferase assays, HEK293 cells stably expressing mouse TRH-R1 (NS R1-17 clone) were transfected with 0.8 μg/ml of pAP(Activator Protein)-1Luc vector (PathDetect in vivo signal transduction pathway trans- and cis-reporting system; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), using FuGENE™ 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland). Ligand Binding Assays—All binding experiments were performed in intact cell monolayer in 24-well plates. Competition binding assays at equilibrium to measure IC50 of inhibition were performed at 37 °C for 1 h with 1 nm [3H]MeTRH and various concentrations of unlabeled TRH or TRH analogs as described (6Lu X. Huang W. Worthington S. Drabik P. Osman R. Gershengorn M.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1192-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Saturation experiments at equilibrium to determine apparent binding affinity for [3H]MeTRH and TRH-R1/R2 expression level were performed at 37 °C for 1 h using 0.1–10 nm [3H]MeTRH as described (7Perlman J.H. Nussenzveig D.R. Osman R. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24413-24417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Internalization Assay—The cells were incubated at 37 °C with 50 nm TRH or 50 μm R-Desaza-TRH for varied times. The cells were washed twice with 2 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and incubated at 4 °C for 1 min with ice-cold acid solution (0.2 m acetic acid, 0.5 m NaCI, pH 2.5). This treatment removed 96% of the [3H]TRH specifically bound at the cell surface (8Drmota T. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice with 2 ml of ice-cold HBSS, 10 mm Hepes and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with 10 nm [H3]MeTRH. After washing three times with 2 ml of ice-cold HBSS, 10 mm Hepes, the cell-associated radioactivity was measured by dissolving the cells with 1 ml of 0.4 N NaOH and mixing with scintillation liquid. Luciferase Assay—After 33 h of transfection, the cells were incubated for an additional 15 h in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin and then stimulated for 5 h with or without ligand. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated on ice for 15 min with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Gly-Gly, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.8). One hundred microliters of lysate were mixed automatically with 125 μl of reaction buffer (25 mm Gly-Gly, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm ATP, pH 7.8) and 25 μl of 0.4 mm luciferin solution in reaction buffer, and the luminescence was measured for 3 s in a Victor™3 multilabel counter 1420 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Data are expressed as relative light units. Measurement of Phosphoinositide Hydrolysis—The cells were labeled for 24 h by incubation with 2 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The cells were washed with HBSS, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and incubated at 37 °C in 10 mm LiCl HBSS solution in the absence or presence of agonist. The cells were lysed, and accumulated IPs were measured using ion-exchange chromatography as described (9Jinsi-Parimoo A. Gershengorn M.C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1471-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). IPs conversion was calculated as [3H]IP% = 100 × [3H]IP/([3H]lipids + [3H]IP). Membrane Preparation—Membranes were prepared from HEK293 cells expressing a stably transfected mouse TRH-R2. The cells in 15-cm dishes were washed twice with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature and incubated at 4 °C for 15 min in 10 ml of 10 mm Hepes solution, pH 7.4, in the presence of 1 mm EGTA, fortified with protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science, 1 tablet/25 ml). The swollen cells were harvested by scraping and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes), and the nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The postnuclear membrane fraction was collected from the supernatant by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The purified membranes were extracted in the presence of 7 m urea to remove accessory proteins as described previously for BALB/c fibroblasts expressing bombesin receptors (10Jian X. Sainz E.

Purification of G-protein Subunits and GDP/GTPγS Exchange Assay—Gαq was isolated from cuttlefish (Sepia officnales) retinas essentially as described by Hartman and Northup for squid Gαq (11Hartman J.L. IV Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22591-22597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cholate extracts from microvillus membrane fractions of Sepia retina were sequentially chromatographed over DEAE-Sephacel and Ultrogel AcA44. The peak of Gαq was exchanged into a solution containing 4 mm CHAPS by chromatography over Sephadex G-50 prior to storage at –80 °C. Recombinant human β1γ2 expressed in Sf9 cells was purified as described previously (12Wildman D.E. Tamir H. Leberer E. Northup J.K. Dennis M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), except that the viral infections were carried out at multiplicity of infection 2 for β1 and 10 for γ2. The purified β1γ2 was additionally chromatographed over Superdex HR75 in a solution containing 8 mm CHAPS prior to storage at –80 °C. The TRH-R2-catalyzed GDP/GTPγS exchange on Gα was determined as described previously for bombesin receptors (10Jian X. Sainz E. Clark W.A. Jensen R.T. Battey J.F. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11573-11581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) with the reaction solutions containing bovine serum albumin at final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Data Analysis—All data were analyzed by linear or non-linear regression using the Prism software version 4 (GraphPad, Inc., San Diego, CA). Functional characterization of a number of TRH analogs revealed that the IC50/EC50 ratio, the ratio of the concentration of an analog that causes 50% inhibition of [3H]MeTRH binding divided by the concentration that causes 50% stimulation, for certain TRH analogs is higher than that for TRH in HEK293 cells stably expressing TRH-R1 or TRH-R2 (Table 1, Fig. 1). Although the absolute values of IC50/EC50 ratios in cells expressing TRH-R2 were higher than in cells expressing TRH-R1, the relative differences in the ratios between TRH and TRH analogs in both cell populations were similar. The higher IC50/EC50 ratios in cells expressing TRH-R2 may, in part, be caused by the higher level of TRH-R2 surface expression when compared with TRH-R1 (∼900 × 103 TRH-R2/cell versus ∼300 × 103 TRH-R1/cell). The higher IC50/EC50 ratios for certain TRH analogs when compared with TRH in the same cell type is consistent with higher intrinsic efficacies for these agonists.TABLE 1Pharmacological characteristics of TRH analogs in TRH-R1(R1)- and TRH-R2(R2)-expressing cellsAgonistR1 IC50R1 EC50R1 IC50/EC50R2 IC50R2 EC50R2 IC50/EC50nmnmnmnmTRH4.4 ± 0.423.2 ± 0.881.42.7 ± 0.20.40 ± 0.0576.8NP-6543000 ± 230300 ± 6310.02020 ± 11061.7 ± 10.632.7S-Desaza-TRH1470 ± 120210 ± 397.0340 ± 229.4 ± 1.336.2R-Desaza-TRH6150 ± 5401000 ± 2206.21960 ± 11041.6 ± 5.747.1 Open table in a new tab As differences in intrinsic efficacies of agonists are more readily apparent in cells expressing low levels of receptors because the effect of “spare receptors” is diminished, we measured the activities of various TRH analogs (Figs. 1 and 2) in a cell line with a level of TRH-R1 expression (SN-R1-17 clone, ∼70 × 103 receptors/cell) similar to that found in pituitary cells (13Ramsdell J.S. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5301-5306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2A illustrates a representative comparison of TRH and R-Desaza-TRH in activation of TRH-R1. Although R-Desaza-TRH exhibits a lower potency than TRH, it exhibits a higher efficacy; that is, R-Desaza-TRH stimulates a higher level of IP production than TRH at similar occupancy of the receptor (based on the almost parallel dose-response curves for the two agonists). In Fig. 2B, the relative intrinsic efficacies of a series of TRH analogs, defined as the ratio of the maximal level of IP formation stimulated by a TRH analog divided by IP formation stimulated by TRH, were plotted versus pEC50 values for the agonists, where pEC50 is the function (–logEC50) as described in the legend for Fig. 2. We found that the more potent compounds exhibited poorer efficacies to stimulate IP formation. Indeed, His(1-methyl)-TRH (MeTRH), the only known TRH analog with an affinity higher than TRH, stimulated IP formation less than TRH. The linear relationship between pEC50 values and intrinsic efficacies shown in Fig. 2B is limited because there are no TRH analogs with potencies between Phe2-TRH and TRH. To obtain additional evidence to support the idea that MeTRH is a less effective agonist than R-Desaza-TRH, we measured the effect of MeTRH on IP formation stimulated by R-Desaza-TRH. As predicted, MeTRH inhibited R-Desaza-TRH-stimulated IP formation in a dose-dependent manner, behaving as a classical partial agonist (Fig. 3). In this experiment, the apparent inhibitory constant for MeTRH at TRH-R1 (0.32 ± 0.16 nm), estimated from the IC50 of inhibition, is similar to the dissociation constant determined in saturation binding experiments (0.61 ± 0.10 nm), consistent with a competition between the two analogs for the same site on TRH-R1. We also measured the efficacies of TRH analogs using luciferase gene transcription as a reporter of TRH-R signaling. In this system, luciferase expression is mediated by AP1 (activating protein 1) transcription factor, which is activated by protein kinase C during TRH-R signaling (2Sun Y. Lu X. Gershengorn M.C. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 30: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 14Wang W. Gershengorn M.C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4916-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Luciferase gene transcription stimulated by TRH is partially inhibited by pertussis toxin, 4S. Neumann, in preparation. indicating the ability of TRH-R to couple to pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins, most likely of the Gi and/or Go family, in addition to Gq/11. As shown in Fig. 4, the efficacy profiles of TRH analogs measured by luciferase activity were similar to those obtained when measuring IP formation. Moreover, the responses stimulated by the different agonists showed similar levels of pertussis toxin sensitivity, indicating a similar ability to activate Gi and/or Go. In separate experiments, in which we measured accumulation of cAMP, we showed that TRH-R stimulated with both high and low affinity compounds was unable to activate Gs protein (not shown). These results suggest that all analogs activate the same signal transduction pathways and do not exhibit pathway (or G-protein) selectivity. Signaling by GPCRs is rapidly desensitized by uncoupling of receptors from their signaling pathways. Therefore, it was possible that the increased agonist efficacy of some analogs may have been due to decreased desensitization. Because desensitization is usually mediated by phosphorylation by one or more protein kinases (15Hassan A. Mason D. J. Endocrinol. 2005; 184: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 16Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 17Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that the interaction of the activated TRH-R with a specific protein kinase is ligand-specific and contributes to generation of the efficacy differences between the TRH analogs. As shown in Fig. 5A, the specific protein kinase C inhibitor Ro-31-8425 (18Merritt J.E. Sullivan J.A. Tse J. Wilkinson S. Nixon J.S. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), as well as the broad range protein kinase inhibitor HA-1077 (19Sasaki Y. Suzuki M. Hidaka H. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 93: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), had no effect on the ligand specificity of the TRH-R1 response. Upon prolonged stimulation, the balance between the rates of receptor desensitization and resensitization determines the steady state level of active receptors on the cell surface and thus the efficacy of response (15Hassan A. Mason D. J. Endocrinol. 2005; 184: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To answer the question whether the internalization (and recycling) of the agonist-TRH-R complex, as part of the desensitization/resensitization pathway, is affected by the nature of agonist, we compared the ability of TRH and R-Desaza-TRH to trigger TRH-R1 loss from the cell surface. As shown in Fig. 5B, no differences in the rates or extents of TRH-R1 internalization were observed using these agonists. During the course of resensitization, a phosphorylation(s) introduced by protein kinase(s) is reversed by the action of distinct endosomal phosphatases (15Hassan A. Mason D. J. Endocrinol. 2005; 184: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 20Roosterman D. Cottrell G.S. Schmidlin F. Steinhoff M. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30670-30679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the unphosphorylated receptor is returned to the cell surface. We have used the pharmacological agents preferentially affecting the activity of endosomal phosphatases to test the possibility that the efficiency of dephosphorylation is dependent on the nature of the agonist-receptor complex internalized and contributes to the efficacy differences between TRH analogs. Okadaic acid, the selective inhibitor of the activity of PP1 and PP2A phosphatases (21Garland A.M. Grady E.F. Lovett M. Vigna S.R. Frucht M.M. Krause J.E. Bunnett N.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 438-446PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the specific inhibitor of vacuolar-type H+-ATPase folimycin (concanamycin A) (22Huss M. Ingenhorst G. Konig S. Gassel M. Drose S. Zeeck A. Altendorf K. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40544-40548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and ammonium chloride, both preventing the endosomal acidification required for phosphatase activity, had no significant effect on the relative ability of MeTRH and R-Desaza-TRH to stimulate IP formation (Fig. 5C). Whatever the mechanism responsible for the observed differences in the efficacies of agonists is, the phenomenon reflects variations in the ability of an agonist-receptor complex to activate the corresponding G-protein. A possible reason behind this effect can be an altered affinity of the activated receptor for the subunits of G-protein. If this were correct, it would be possible to decrease the efficacy differences by overexpression of a corresponding G-protein, pushing the thermodynamic equilibrium toward complex formation. As shown in Fig. 6, the overexpression of human Gαq enhanced the overall rate of IP formation, indicating that in this system, the availability of G-protein is a limiting factor in TRH-R1 signaling. However, the increase in the fraction of the receptors coupled to G-protein had no effect on the ligand specificity of the response. In intact cells assays, in which a signal is measured downstream in a signal transduction pathway, a number of factors can influence the output of receptor stimulation (efficacy of a receptor-agonist pair), whereas the effect of only a few of them can be tested directly (e.g. using pharmacological agents). Thus, we decided to analyze the functional properties of the TRH analogs using a membrane-based assay in which the ability of a receptor to catalyze GDP/GTPγS exchange is tested using a purified exogenous G-protein. This assay monitors the initial steps in a signal-transduction cascade and has no complications related to the presence of spare receptors inherent for most cellular systems employing overexpressed receptors. Because we were unable to achieve high levels of TRH-R1 expression, we used cells stably expressing TRH-R2 at a high level (SN-R2-114 clone, 4 × 106 receptors/cell) for the membrane preparation. The isolated membranes were extracted with 7 m urea, which has been shown to eliminate the majority of GTPγS binding to endogenous proteins (10Jian X. Sainz E. Clark W.A. Jensen R.T. Battey J.F.

We suppose that most of the peripheral and cytoplasmic proteins that can affect receptor-G-protein interactions are also removed upon this treatment, making it possible to study the direct activation of exogenous G-protein by a receptor.

It was shown previously that this combination of subunits is most efficiently activated by TRH-R2 (not shown). The dependence of the initial rates of GDP/GTPγS exchange catalyzed by TRH-R2 on the concentration of MeTRH and R-Desaza-TRH is shown in Fig. 7A. At saturation, R-Desaza-TRH was about twice as effective in the stimulation of GTPγS binding as MeTRH. This is consistent with the results obtained in the intact cells experiments, supporting the idea that the observed differences in the efficacies of TRH analogs originate in the varied abilities of the agonist-TRH-R complexes to directly activate G-protein. The EC50 for stimulating GTPγS binding for both MeTRH and R-Desaza-TRH is an order of magnitude higher than the corresponding dissociation constant measured in the binding experiments in intact cells. This discrepancy may be attributed to the differences in the properties of the agonist-TRH-R-G-protein complex naturally occurring in the intact cells and that being formed upon reconstitution of the isolated membranes with the exogenous G heterotrimer. However, this difference had no effect on the agonist specificity of signaling efficacy. Fig. 7B shows the time course of MeTRH- and R-Desaza-TRH-stimulated GTPγS binding mediated by TRH-R2. The concentration of GTPγS was limiting in this reaction, and its association with G-protein follows a pseudo-first-order kinetics with half-lives of 8.6 and 4.1 min for MeTRH and R-Desaza-TRH, respectively. As noted above, the nature of the agonist may affect the recognition (affinity) of effector G-protein by agonist-receptor complex. Under non-saturating conditions with G-protein, this would result in different efficacies for agonists. To test this idea, we performed a Gαq saturation analysis of TRH-R2-mediated GDP/GTPγS exchange in the presence of MeTRH and R-Desaza-TRH (Fig. 7C). The similar Km of activation for both compounds, as well as the inability of the saturating concentrations of Gαq to abolish the differences in the maximal activation, indicated that the recognition of G-protein by the agonist-TRHR complex is not affected by the nature of agonist and cannot explain the efficacy differences observed for TRH analogs. This is consistent with the fact that Gαq overexpressed in TRH-R1-expressing cells is unable to decrease the difference in the rates of IP formation stimulated by MeTRH and R-Desaza-TRH (Fig. 6). We showed for the first time that certain TRH analogs are more efficacious agonists at TRH-R1 and TRH-R2 than the cognate ligand TRH. We found that decreases in the affinities caused by changes in TRH structure correlate inversely with the ability of the analog to activate TRH-Rs. Thus, the low affinity analogs are super-agonists for these receptors. To investigate the mechanism of this phenomenon, we attempted to determine the part of the signaling process responsible for the observed effect. The “multiple active state” theory of GPCR activation suggests the existence of multiple efficacies for a ligand (24Kenakin T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 346-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Besides the direct activation of G-protein, a ligand can selectively alter the interactions of a receptor with other intra- or extracellular components, for example components of the desensitization machinery, resulting in ligand-specific differences in receptor stimulation. We have tested the possible involvement of receptor recycling as well as a role of specific protein kinases in establishment of the efficacy differences among TRH analogs. The results of these experiments in which agents that affect desensitization and resensitization had no effect on the efficacies of TRH analogs suggest that the observed variations in the efficacies of TRH analogs most probably originate from the altered ability of an agonist-receptor complex to directly activate G-protein rather than affecting the functions of accessory proteins. This conclusion was further supported by the use of isolated membranes to monitor TRH-R activation of G-protein directly using GTPγS binding assays. In these experiments, in which the concentrations of receptor and G-proteins can be controlled and their direct interaction monitored, the different efficacies between TRH analogs persisted. In interpreting the results of GTPγS binding experiments, we have assumed that the urea treatment of the membranes eliminates the majority of the peripheral accessory proteins; however, we cannot exclude the possibility that some integral proteins may affect binding. Variations in efficacy ultimately reflect an altered ability of an agonist-receptor complex to activate G-protein, that is, to increase the catalytic rate of GDP/GTPγS exchange. The catalytic rate depends on both the affinity of interaction of the agonist-receptor complex with G-protein, that is, on the concentration of catalytically active agonist/TRH-R/G-protein complexes, and the catalytic efficiency of the activated complexes in the exchange reaction. Both of these may depend on the agonist. We showed that at saturating concentrations of agonists, increasing the concentration of Gα did not change the activity of the MeTRH/TRH-R complex relative to that of the R-Desaza-TRH/TRH-R complex and, therefore, concluded that the affinity of interaction of the agonist-TRH-R complex with Gα subunit is not dependent on the nature of agonists. However, it has been shown by Clark et al. (25Clark W.A. Jian X. Chen L. Northup J.K. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 389-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that Gβγ subunits can interact with an agonist-receptor complex independently of Gα, providing a scaffold facilitating the subsequent interaction of the complex with Gα and thereby affecting the fraction of activated complexes. Thus, it is possible that altered interactions of the receptor with Gβγ are responsible for the efficacy differences between TRH analogs. Although the Gβ1γ2 dimer used in our experiments was effective in promoting TRH-R-mediated GTPγS binding, its low apparent affinity of interaction with TRH-R2 (not shown) made it impractical to test its effect by saturation analysis. Because of the uncertainty in the concentrations of effective agonist/TRH-R/G-protein complexes, we cannot compare the catalytic efficiency of the different agonist-receptor complexes nor draw any conclusion about the contribution of this factor to the efficacy differences between TRH analogs. TRH is a tripeptide, and alteration of any of its constituting amino acids results, in general, in decreased affinity for both TRH-R1 and TRH-R2; the only known exception is MeTRH, which has a higher affinity than TRH. We have shown that the decreases in affinities are accompanied by increases in the efficacies of the analogs. Since this effect is not dependent on the alteration of a specific residue of TRH (we have tested modifications at all three constituting amino acids, Fig. 1), it seems unlikely that specific interactions involved in the receptor activation are affected by these changes. Rather, this phenomenon may reflect a general property of the receptor active state, somehow promoted by the low affinity agonists. In the classical two-state model of GPCR activation, the efficacy of an agonist is proportional to the difference between its affinity to the active and inactive states of a receptor (26Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Liapakis G. Chan W.C. Papadokostaki M. Javitch J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1181-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This model can explain the inverse correlation observed between the affinities and efficacies of TRH analogs assuming that the structural changes leading to the affinity loss decrease the ability of the agonist to bind to the inactive state of a receptor more than to the active state. A weak point in this explanation is that the nonspecific structural changes have a specific effect on the binding, selectively targeting one of the two conformation states. In an alternative view, receptors may attain a number of active (or inactive) conformations, each with distinct functional characteristics. This hypothesis allows rationalizing the increasing number of experimental observations that cannot be easily explained by the two-state model (32Vauquelin G. Van L.I. Fundam. Clin. Pharmacol. 2005; 19: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). From the known kon of TRH association with TRH-R1 (28Perlman J.H. Colson A.O. Jain R. Czyzewski B. Cohen L.A. Osman R. Gershengorn M.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15670-15676Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and the dissociation constants for TRH analogs, the half-lives of receptor residency (t½) for these agonists can be estimated, making an assumption that similar compounds have similar kon. The first-order dissociation kinetics gives t½ of ∼50 min, ∼20 min, ∼2s, and <1 s for MeTRH, TRH, NP 654, and R-Desaza-TRH, respectively. It appears that in the time frame in which a signal is measured, the receptor complex with a low affinity agonist undergoes multiple cycles of association-dissociation. Considering a non-zero relaxation time, this process would result in the formation of a distinct state for the receptor (for the binding pocket), which can be regarded as a “dynamic” conformation. This is in contrast to the receptor complex with a high affinity agonist, in which the ligand “spends” most of its time tightly bound to the receptor (“static” state). We speculate that this dynamic conformation represents a more active state of the receptor than the static state. Ramsdell and Tashjian (13Ramsdell J.S. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5301-5306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed previously that the EC50 of TRH-stimulated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation in GH4C1 cells (∼100 × 103 receptors/cell) over a short period of time (5 s) is about 2 orders of magnitude higher than those observed for sustained TRH actions, such as stimulated prolactin release, prolactin synthesis, and equilibrium receptor binding. In the absence of spare receptors, this was interpreted by the authors as being caused by the ability of TRH to induce decrease in the rate of its dissociation with longer duration of receptor occupancy. They proposed that rapid actions of TRH occur with a form of the receptor that exhibits rapid dissociation kinetics and requires multiple ligand-receptor interactions for a maximal response. Moreover, they showed that at this stage, the receptor does not discriminate between TRH and MeTRH. This finding is consistent with the data of Hinkle and Kinsella (39), indicating that the dissociation rate of TRH from TRH-R decreases from a t½ of less than 1 min to 18 min with increasing time of exposure. Biphasic binding kinetics have been demonstrated for agonists in several GPCRs (30Swaminath G. Xiang Y. Lee T.W. Steenhuis J. Parnot C. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 686-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 31Palanche T. Ilien B. Zoffmann S. Reck M.P. Bucher B. Edelstein S.J. Galzi J.L. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2005; 19: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The data from these experiments were modeled by a similar assumption of the existence of a sequential process in which a fast equilibrium bimolecular step is followed by a slow monomolecular “isomerization” of the complex (32Vauquelin G. Van L.I. Fundam. Clin. Pharmacol. 2005; 19: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 33Jarv J. Oras A. Neurosci. Lett. 2005; 373: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). It was also shown that the rapid phase of binding corresponds to a primary receptor activation and the slow phase correlates with secondary effects, such as internalization, as exemplified in β2-adrenergic receptors (30Swaminath G. Xiang Y. Lee T.W. Steenhuis J. Parnot C. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 686-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Thus, rapid and slower kinetics of signaling or binding have been observed in several GPCR systems. Taking the above described observations into consideration, we can propose an alternative to the two-state model mechanism of TRH-R activation, to account for the inverse correlation between potencies and efficacies of TRH analogs described in this study. TRH-R activation is a sequential process starting with fast initial binding of an agonist to a low affinity binding site. This step results in the formation of a highly active dynamic conformation of the receptor. In the next slower step, the agonist-receptor complex undergoes an induced fit to achieve a less active state characterized by a static conformation of the receptor. Transition from the dynamic to static states can be associated with movement of the ligand deeper into the transmembrane domain, as was suggested by Colson and co-workers (23Colson A.O. Perlman J.H. Smolyar A. Gershengorn M.C. Osman R. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1087-1100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28Perlman J.H. Colson A.O. Jain R. Czyzewski B. Cohen L.A. Osman R. Gershengorn M.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15670-15676Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) to explain the apparent existence of surface and transmembrane binding pockets for TRH. The relative abundance of the agonist-receptor complexes attaining this final conformation is related to the binding energy available to stabilize it (affinity of agonist). This step is mainly responsible for the discrimination of ligands by the receptor. In the presence of a low affinity agonist, such as R-Desaza-TRH, the receptor does not effectively convert to the static conformation and remains highly active for the time of exposure. In contrast, the high affinity natural hormone TRH induces the static state that limits rapid signaling and decreases its efficacy. This may represent a more rapid mechanism than desensitization to inhibit TRH-R overstimulation. In addition, the static conformation might be associated with a distinct functionality of the against-receptor complex, which was not revealed in this study. We have found no previous reports describing a similar inverse relationship between efficacies and affinities among GPCR agonists. The question whether this phenomenon is unique for TRH receptors remains open and needs further evaluation. The conditions of spare receptors common for most cellular systems using overexpressed receptors may make this phenomenon difficult to detect. According to the multiple active states theory of GPCR activation, different agonists can employ alternative mechanisms to activate a receptor, each with a distinct subset of the amino acids involved. In each case, the signal output measured (efficacy) might be different. In our case, the functional properties tested in TRH receptors stimulated by low and high affinity agonists, including regulation and G-protein specificity, appear to be similar. We suggest that all TRH analogs used in this study share a similar molecular mechanism of receptor activation, thus revealing other unappreciated aspects of the structure-activity relationships present in this agonist-GPCR system.

SODs have been classified into four types based on the metal species at the enzyme active site: Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD, Fe-SOD, and Ni-SOD. The theory of free radicals and tumors held that reactive oxygen species (ROS) originating in redundant radicals attacked the organism, leading to genetic mutation and tumor formation (1Hruszkewycz A.M. Bergtold D.S. Basic Life Sci. 1988; 49: 449-456PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kodama M. Inoue F. Nakayama T. Nagata C. Arch Biochem.

For this reason, attempts to treat ROS-associated diseases with non-selective SOD have failed and may have caused deleterious effects in normal cells as well as in tumor cells. Using genetic techniques, Oyanagui (9Oyanagui Y. Sato S. Inoue M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) fused SOD with a polypeptide that could recognize heparin sulfates on vascular endothelial cells; the resultant HB-SOD could locate vascular endothelial cells by itself. In addition to potential non-specific cell targeting, SOD has another critical disadvantage in clinical application; its large molecular weight interferes with its ability to permeate the cell membrane, which leads to a low cellular effect. Currently, a liposome is used to enclose the SOD, and the resultant liposome-SOD can permeate the cell membrane or tissue (10Delanian S. Martin M. Bravard A. Luccioni C. Lefaix J.L. Radiother. Oncol. 2001; 58: 325-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 11Jubeh T.T. Antler S. Haupt S. Barenholz Y. Rubinstein A. Mol.

Biopharm. 2005; 60: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). But thus far, modified SODs still either cannot distinguish the target cells (tumor cells) or cannot permeate the tumor cell membrane. The single chain variable fragment (ScFv) antibody not only has a much lower immune binding than does monoclonal antibody (mAb) but also has a low molecular weight; thus, it can more easily reach intracellular targets. ScFv from the LC-1 hybridoma cell line can react at a high frequency with lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous carcinoma, and large cell and small cell lung cancer, but not with normal and embryonic tissues (13Ge X.R. Wang J. Lin S.J. Yu N.X. Che Y.F. Gu Y. Acta Biologiae. Exprimentalis Sin. 1989; 22: 359-365Google Scholar). When this ScFv recognized and bound antigens on SPC-A-1 cells, the antigen-antibody complexes were internalized via the receptor-mediated endocytic pathway and permeated the cell membrane (14Xie W. Zhang R.X. Ge X.R. Acta Biologiae Exprimentalis Sin. 1996; 29: 207-219Google Scholar). This characteristic implies that using LC-1 ScFv to aid SOD targeting can be an effective anti-lung cancer drug because it overcomes both clinical SOD disadvantages, it will target only tumor cells and will be taken up intracellularly. In the current research, the Nostoc commune Fe-SOD and LC-1 ScFv were cloned and co-expressed, with the idea that the resultant fusion protein would possess dual activity. In theory, LC-1 ScFv would be able to introduce SOD into SPC-A-1 cells specifically and permeate the cell membrane via the receptor-mediated endocytic pathway. Once inside the cell, it would eliminate intracellular O2·¯, change the cellular redox state, and subsequently induce a pathway related to a low cellular O2·¯ level, inhibiting tumor cell proliferation.

Then the SOD and ScFv fragments were cloned into pET-22b (+) to be pET-SOD-ScFv (see Fig. 1) and transformed into JM109. Expression, Purification, and Immunoblot Analyses of SOD, ScFv, and SOD-ScFv—The pET-SOD was induced in the presence of 0.5 mm IPTG and 300 μm [Fe3+] in 1 liter of LB culture medium at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g and lysed in 50 ml of TE (20 mm Tris-HCl and 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The lysate was disrupted using sonication (800 W, 20 min). The achieved sedimentation (SOD) after sonication was washed with wash buffer I (1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100) and buffer II (wash buffer I with 2 m carbamide). Then the sedimented material was dissolved in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.3% sodium lauryl sulfate, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) overnight. The lysate was poured into a column with 5 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow Resin, and the packed resin was washed with buffer consisting of imidazole gradient concentrations (0-500 mm). A280 was measured. The denatured protein was renatured in lysis buffer (excluding sodium lauryl sulfate) that included 100 μm [Fe3+], at 4 °C. The SOD-ScFv fusion protein was expressed and purified from pET-SOD-ScFv as described above. The ScFv was expressed and purified from pET-ScFv as described above, except that there was no [Fe3+] in the LB culture medium or the renaturing buffer. Natural Fe-SOD protein was purified from N. commune directly as follows: 500 g of N. commune was lysed in 1 liter of PBS (including 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.6) and disrupted using sonication (1 200 W, 60 min). Then the crude materials (Fe-SOD) were deposited in 45-85% (NH4)2SO4 for 6 h. The crude Fe-SOD was dissolved again and purified by DEAE-Sepharose fast flow and Sephadex G-100, respectively. The expression of pET-SOD and pET-SOD-ScFv was subjected to Western blot analysis (the anti-SOD antiserum was raised against natural N. commune Fe-SOD in mice). The SOD activity of purified SOD and SOD-ScFv was assayed using the pyrogallol auto-oxidation method (17Marklund S. Marklund G. Eur J Biochem. 1974; 47: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (7732) Google Scholar). The antibody activity of purified ScFv and SOD-ScFv was assayed by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as follows: 0.01 μg/μl LC-1 mAb and the purified ScFv (or SOD-ScFv) were used to bind SPC-A-1 cells competitively (AGS cells and HepG2 cells served as controls); goat anti-mouse-labeled anti-IgM secondary antibody was used to bind to the LC-1 antibody. A490 was measured. Determination of the Cell Membrane Permeation Ability of SOD-ScFv by Fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC) Fluorescence Tracing and Immunoblot Analyses—To trace the permeation process of SOD-ScFv through the SPC-A-1 cell membrane, SOD, ScFv, and SOD-ScFv were labeled with FITC essentially according to Lindsay et al. (18Lindsay M.P. Tamas L. Appels R. Skerritt J.H. J. Cereal Sci. 2000; 31: 321-333Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A 0.1 μm sample was dissolved in 10 ml of 100 mm carbonate buffer, pH 9.0. To each sample was added 10 μl of 1% w/v FITC in dimethyl sulfoxide, and labeling was performed at room temperature overnight. Each labeled sample was dialyzed at 4 °C for 72 h against pH 8.0 PBS. The samples were additionally separated by a Sephadex G-25 column. The fluorescence intensity of sample was measured by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, 850, Japan). The prepared SPC-A-1 cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.2 μm SOD-ScFv-FITC for 20, 40, and 60 min at 37 °C. Following three washes to remove unbound protein, intracellular FITC fluorescence was observed by LCSM (LSM 510, Zeiss, Germany). The intracellular stability of SOD-ScFv was estimated by Western blotting as follows. After SPC-A-1 cells were treated with 0.2 μm SOD-ScFv for 1 h, cells were washed and changed with a fresh culture medium. Then, cells were further incubated for 0, 6, 12, and 24 h followed by Western blot analysis with anti-SOD antiserum. Determination of Targeted Antitumor Ability of SOD-ScFv—A total of 90 μl of SPC-A-1 cells were grown in a 96-well plate until 30% confluent. Then, 10 μl of SOD-ScFv of the working concentrations (0.2-2 μm) were added for 1 h, and cells were washed and changed with a fresh culture medium for 48 h. Cells were counted using a hemocytometer (AGS cells and HepG2 cells served as negative controls); a cycle of cells (treated as described above) from a 6-well plate was analyzed by flow cytometry (FAC sort, Becton Dickinson) according to Mahadevan et al. (19Mahadevan B. Luch A. Seidel A. Pelling J.C. Baird W.M. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Analysis of Cellular Superoxide Anions by LCSM—Cellular superoxide anions (O2·¯) were measured using DHE as a fluorescent dye relatively specific for O2·¯ (20Fujimura M. Morita-Fujimura Y. Kawase M. Copin J.C. Calagui B. Epstein C.J. Chan P.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: C3414-C3422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity from O2·¯ in individual SPC-A-1 cells was traced over time essentially according to Bindokas et al. (21Bindokas V.P. Jordan J. Lee C.C. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 76: 1324-1336Crossref Google Scholar). After incubation with 0.2 μm SOD-ScFv in fresh culture medium at 37 °C for 1 h, the cells were washed with PBS and put in fresh culture medium with 20 μm DHE at 37 °C. After 5 min, the DHE fluorescence became visible on the LCSM and then cellular DHE fluorescence was scanned instantly for time-lapse images. Intracellular O2·¯ was monitored for at least 1500 s, and the temperature of the cells was maintained at 37 °C. In addition, intracellular calcium flux response to 0.2 μm SOD-ScFv (PBS and 50 μm H2O2 served as controls) was observed using fluo-3 AM for 1 h on LCSM, essentially according to Deng et al. (22Deng T.L. Yu L. Ge Y.K. Zhang L. Zheng X.X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 748-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Analysis of Mitochondrial Transmembrane Potential (ΔΨm) by Fluorescence Spectrophotometer—Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in SPC-A-1 cells was measured using two different dyes, rhodamine-123 and CM-H2TMRos. Rhodamine-123, a conventional, cationic voltage-sensitive probe that reversibly accumulates in mitochondria, was used in the present study to detect changes in ΔΨm. Cells were incubated with 1 μm rhodamine-123 at 37 °C for 30 min after 1 h of drug incubation. After three washings, the fluorescence intensity of the sample was analyzed by fluorescence spectrophotometer. CM-H2TMRos is a new fluorescent dye developed recently that is more photostable and stable in mitochondria (23Poot M. Zhang Y.Z. Kramer J.A. Wells K.S. Jones L.J. Hanzel D.K. Lugade A.G. Singer V.L. Haugland R.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1363-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). It was also used to measure the ΔΨm as described above, excepting cells that were incubated with 500 nm CM-H2TMRos. Cellular Oxidative Stress and Reducing Power Assay by Flow Cytometry—The oxidative stress of SPC-A-1 cells was determined by detection of cellular ROS with DCFH-DC (24Sawada G.A. Raub T.J. Decker D.E. Buxser S.E. Cytometry. 1996; 25: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, after incubation with 0.2 μm SOD-ScFv in fresh culture medium for 1 h, cells were washed and incubated with 5 μm DCF-DA for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed three times with probe-free nitrate buffer. The fluorescence intensity of the sample was measured by flow cytometry. The cellular reduced glutathione (GSH) level was measured as an index to reflect the cellular reducing power in SPC-A-1 cells; GSH is oxidized to oxidized glutathione under the stress of superoxide anions or hydrogen peroxide. The GSH level was determined by staining cells with 500 μm NDA (25Orwar O. Fishman H.A. Ziv N.E. Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 4261-4268Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) as described above, then cells were washed three times, and fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytometry. Reduced Oxidative Stress Effect on SPC-A-1 Cells through Akt/p27 kip1 Pathway—A total of 1.8 ml of SPC-A-1 cells were grown in a 6-well plate until 80% confluent, then treated with SOD-ScFv at 37 °C for 1 h (PBS served as control). After treatment, 106 cells were disrupted, and then cellular phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) levels and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels were analyzed by Western blotting. To analyze the expression levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1, 1.8 ml of SPC-A-1 cells were grown in 6-well plate until 30% confluent, 200 μl of SOD-ScFv were added for 1 h (PBS served as control), and cells were washed and changed with a fresh culture medium for 24 h. A total of 106 cells were disrupted, and the cellular p27kip1 level was analyzed by Western blotting. Based on data for other similar Fe-SODs of prokaryotic algae in GenBank™, we assumed that the Fe-SOD coding region in N. commune genome was continuous. Based on these Fe-SOD sequences, the degenerate primer SOD-forward/SOD-back was designed, and a fragment (GenBank™ accession AY830114) of 603 bp was achieved, whose deduced protein was in accordance with the molecular weight of natural Fe-SOD, which was purified from N. commune (22 kDa). These findings implied that this 603-bp coding sequence was the N. commune Fe-SOD CDS. This conclusion was supported by Western blotting analysis of expressed Fe-SOD or SOD-ScFv against natural Fe-SOD antiserum (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4). BLAST search results from GenBank™ showed that this CDS had about 85% nucleotide similarity with Nostoc linckia Fe-SOD. It was found that when the cells were induced by IPTG, additional FeCl3 could improve the yield of the expected protein (26Kim Y.C. Miller C.D. Anderson A.J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 239: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The expressed SOD, ScFv, and SOD-ScFv proteins were composed of ∼78, 65, and 21%, respectively, of the total bacterial protein in the pET-SOD, pET-ScFv, and pET-SOD-ScFv expression vector systems, respectively (data not shown). The SOD activity assay result indicated that the specific activity of expressed SOD and SOD-ScFv was 1100 units/mg and 700 units/mg, respectively, whereas that of natural N. commune Fe-SOD was 2700 units/mg. The competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay result of ScFv showed that the inhibitory rate of 0.1 μg/μl ScFv to 0.01 μg/μl LC-1 antibody was 71.0%, whereas that of ScFv-SOD was 61.2%. But neither showed the ability to bind to AGS cells or HepG2 cells (data not shown). The ability of SOD to permeate the cell membrane is a key point in clinical applications of SOD. Based on the specific spatial structure of SOD, ScFv, or SOD-ScFv, we dyed each with FITC (27Grunwaldt G. Haebel S. Spitz C. Steup M. Menzel R. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. Biol. 2002; 67: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) to determine their ability to permeate the cell membrane and their cellular distribution after permeation. After incubation with SOD-ScFv-FITC for 20 min, the SPC-A-1 cells began to show green fluorescence (Fig. 3E). From Fig. 3I, the FITC localized inside the cell but did not reside on the cell membrane; what is more, it was distributed equally in the cells (Fig. 3, H and I). The ScFv-FITC control exhibited the same pattern (Fig. 3C, some data not shown). However, the SOD-FITC control showed no obvious fluorescence (Fig. 3B), implying that the SOD barely permeated the cell membrane by itself. The intracellular stability of SOD-ScFv in SPC-A-1 cells was shown in Fig. 2B. After permeation, the SOD-ScFv was degraded gradually; however, it could persist in cells for up to 24 h. The targeted antitumor ability of SOD-ScFv is shown in Fig. 4. Cells treated with 0.2 μm SOD-ScFv showed a 46.6% inhibition rate; this increased significantly in a SOD-ScFv dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). In addition, SOD-ScFv did not show the same inhibition in AGS cells or HepG2 cells (Fig. 4B), which implied the specificity of SOD-ScFv for SPC-A-1 cells. To determine how SOD-ScFv inhibited growth of SPC-A-1 cells, a cycle of treated cells was performed (Fig. 4C). It was clear that there was a change in the distribution of cells in G1 phase as a result of cellular overload of SOD. In the SOD-ScFv model, 60.4% of the cells were in G1 phase, whereas only 50.4% of the SOD-treated cells, 51.7% of the ScFv-treated cells, and 47.4% of PBS-treated cells were in G1. A considerable increase in the G1 fraction of SOD-ScFv model cells suggested that the SOD-induced inhibition in cell growth could be associated with the delay at G1. The cellular O2·¯ analysis result is shown in Fig. 5A. The oxidation rate of DHE in SPC-A-1 cells decreased significantly after pretreatment with SOD-ScFv. However, pretreatment of SOD or ScFv produced an oxidation rate not significantly different from PBS control, which showed the low permeation ability of SOD or the invalidation of ScFv in O2·¯ elimination. Interestingly, it was found that the cellular calcium level did not respond to SOD-ScFv in 1 h, whereas cellular calcium levels increased rapidly and distinctly under stimulation with 50 μm H2O2 (data not shown). It is well known that H2O2 can produce a high cellular oxidative stress. The main source of ROS in most cells is the mitochondria (28Hennet T. Richter C. Peterhans E. Biochem J. 1993; 289: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We confirmed this in SPC-A-1 cells according to the perfect superposition of cellular DHE fluorescence and Rh123 fluorescence, which localized to the area of origin of O2·¯ and the mitochondrial area, respectively (Fig. 5B). One parameter that is altered because of ROS production is ΔΨm. Therefore, the effect of a lower O2·¯ level on ΔΨm was determined using Rh123. Fig. 6 shows an increase of Rh123 fluorescent intensity in SPC-A-1 cells (but not in AGS cells or HepG2 cells) by 1.3 times (p < 0.05) after treatment with SOD-ScFv. The CM-H2TMRos group exhibited similar results. These observations implied that lower levels of O2·¯ around the mitochondria could maintain the O2·¯. The O2·¯ impairment by cellular O2·¯ had been reported by Scanlon et al. (29Scanlon J.M. Reynolds I.J. J Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2392-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and Kimura et al. (30Kimura S. Zhang G.X. Nishiyama A. Shokoji T. Yao L. Fan Y.Y. Rahman M. Abe Y. Hypertension. 2005; 45: 438-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Based on the fact that SOD-ScFv can eliminate O2·¯ in SPC-A-1 cells, we determined the cellular redox state aroused by SOD-ScFv after 1 h by detecting cellular ROS and GSH levels. As Fig. 7 shows, it is notable that SOD-ScFv resulted in significant decreases in cellular ROS fluorescence intensity (0.54-fold, p < 0.05) and increases in GSH fluorescence intensity (5.4-fold, p < 0.05), implying that cellular oxidative stress can be regulated by O2·¯ levels in SPC-A-1 cells. Increases in GSH with decreased oxidative stress have been demonstrated in previous studies (31Paz-Miguel J.E. Flores R. Sanchez-Velasco P. Ocejo-Vinyals G. Escribano de Diego J. Lopez de Rego J. Leyva-Cobian F. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5399-5410PubMed Google Scholar, 32Wefers H. Sies H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 137: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism of how SOD-ScFv retarded the cell cycle, we examined the effects of reduced levels of intracellular ROS on some signal-transduction pathways. As shown in Fig. 8, it was found that SOD-ScFv dose dependently inhibited Akt phosphorylation (Thr-308) in a short time (1 h); in the subsequent 24 h, the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p27kip1 (a downstream protein of Akt) was up-regulated in SPC-A-1 cells. This outcome indicated that the Akt/p27kip1 pathway was activated under the reduced level of intracellular ROS in SPC-A-1 cells. However, the mechanism of Akt/p27kip1 pathway activation by ROS remains unclear. We predicted the tertiary structures of N. commune Fe-SOD by ExPASy and found that the four Fe3+-bound sites in the SOD active center, His-28, His-80, and His-166 and Asp-162 were close (a water molecule or a hydroxyl ion is the fifth bound site of Fe3+) (33Lim J.H. Yu Y.G. Choi I.G. Ryu J.R. Ahn B.Y. Kim S.H. Han Y.S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Also, the C terminus amino acid residues of SOD were farther from the enzymatic active center than the N terminus; thus, the ScFv was added to the C terminus of SOD with link-1 to weaken the spatial interference between SOD and ScFv. The dual activity of SOD-ScFv indicated that SOD and ScFv were well separated by link-1. High intracellular ROS levels and low SOD activity were found in many tumor cells. Based on these findings in M14 melanoma cells, Pervaiz et al. (34Pervaiz S. Ramalingam J.K. Hirpara J.L. Clement M.V. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) suggested that an intracellular environment with high ROS concentrations provided tumor cells with a survival advantage over their normal counterparts. It was suggested that ROS acts as an essential intracellular secondary messenger in the regulation of protein kinase activity and relative gene expression and in modulating cell growth, apoptosis, differentiation, and transformation (35Undaresan M. Yu Z. Ferrons V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar, 36Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K.

We here propose that the kinase activity of Akt is regulated via autophosphorylation in trans at two putative sites (threonine 72 and serine 246) that lie in the characteristic Akt substrate motif (RXRXX(S/T)). Incubation of Akt immunoprecipitated from transfected cells with a pre-activated Akt recombinant protein and γ-32P-labeled ATP led to marked incorporation of radioactivity in wild-type Akt but not Akt/T72A/S246A mutant.

Corbin J.D. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1993; 127-128: 51-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have suggested that the Ser-473 of Akt may be phosphorylated via autophosphorylation (23Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar); however, it is arguable because the site does not concur with the well described phosphorylation motif (Arg-Xaa-Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Ser/Thr, or RXRXX(S/T)) that is characteristic of Akt substrates (24Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Using in vitro kinase assays and cell-based assays with transfection, we here report that Akt can indeed phosphorylate itself in vitro at two putative sites (threonine 72 and serine 246), located in the PH domain and the kinase domain of the molecule, respectively, that fall into the Akt substrate phosphorylation motif. The autophosphorylation of Akt may play a role in the transduction of the signals that activate Akt, because experimental point mutation of the two sites to alanine (Akt/T72A/S246A) markedly reduced basal Akt kinase activity and the response to cellular stimulation by insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) when expressed in cells. Furthermore, expression of the Akt/T72A/S246A mutant was less effective than wild-type Akt expression in protecting cells from doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Our results from these pilot studies suggest a potential novel regulatory mechanism through which the signals are augmented after Akt activation. In-depth exploration of this mechanism is warranted, because its elucidation may be crucial for successful development of new drugs that inhibit the function of Akt for treating human diseases such as cancer. Cells and cDNA Constructs—MCF7 human breast cancer cells were originally obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 and 95% air. Human Akt1 cDNA was obtained from MCF7 cells by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction with primers described previously (25Knuefermann C. Lu Y. Liu B. Jin W. Liang K. Wu L. Schmidt M. Mills G.B. Mendelsohn J. Fan Z. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3205-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and cloned into the pcDNA3.1-HisC expression vector (Invitrogen). Constructs containing various point mutations (T72A/S246A, T308A/S473A, and T308D/S473D) of Akt1 were generated using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the wild-type Akt1 expression construct as the polymerase chain reaction template. All of the point mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Expression of the constructs was conducted with the use of a transient transfection procedure by exposing the MCF7 cells to a mixture of the construct and the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Minneapolis, NM) for 16 h. The cells were cultured in regular medium for an additional 24 h for sufficient expression of the transfected constructs before any further experiments were conducted. Antibodies and Other Reagents—Antibodies directed against total Akt protein, phosphorylated Akt substrate (PAS), phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) α/β (S21/9), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and cleaved PARP were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The anti-HisG tag monoclonal antibody was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA), and the anti-HA tag monoclonal antibody was from Invitrogen. Protein A-conjugated Sepharose beads were purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Analysis—Lysates from cultured cells were prepared with a lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2,1mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10% glycerol, 1mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1% Triton X-100. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatants were collected. For immunoprecipitation, equal amounts of lysate protein were incubated with specific anti-tag (HisG or HA) antibody (1 μg per 500 μg of protein) for 2 h and then incubated for 1 h with the protein A-conjugated Sepharose beads. The beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer, and the immunoprecipitates were solubilized by boiling the beads in Laemmli SDS buffer at 100 °C for 5 min. For immunoblotting analysis, immunoprecipitates or lysates with equal amounts of protein were boiled in the Laemmli SDS buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with specific primary antibodies and then subjected to further incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The signals were developed by using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Radioactive and Nonradioactive Akt Kinase Assays—A radioactive Akt kinase assay was performed by in vitro incubation of a pre-activated Akt1 recombinant protein (0.5 μg/assay, Upstate Biotechnology) with 0.8 μl (20 μCi)/assay of γ-32P-labeled ATP (specific activity = 3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) that was titrated with increasing amounts of unlabeled ATP in a kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 10 mm MgCl2,2mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4) for 30 min at 30 °C with a total volume of 30 μl/assay. Alternatively, the wild-type Akt protein or various Akt mutants immunoprecipitated by corresponding anti-tag antibodies from MCF7 cells transiently transfected with various Akt constructs were used as the substrates for the pre-activated Akt1 recombinant protein by incubating them in vitro in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. This procedure was followed by thorough washing of the immunoprecipitation beads to maximally remove the added pre-activated Akt recombinant protein and residual [γ-32P]ATP. After each reaction, the products were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. The results were analyzed with a PhosphorImager or quantitated densitometrically, and the ratios of autophosphorylated Akt to the Akt proteins immunoprecipitated were determined to normalize for any potential differences in each sample caused by immunoprecipitation. A nonradioactive Akt in vitro kinase assay was performed by incubating a GSK3 fusion protein (used as the substrate, 1 μg/assay, Cell Signaling Technology) with the Akt proteins (used as the kinase) immunoprecipitated with corresponding anti-tag antibodies from the lysates of the cells transfected with various Akt expression constructs in the presence of 33.3 μm unlabeled ATP for 30 min at 30 °C in a total volume of 30 μl/assay. The products of the kinase reaction were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis with the phosphorylated GSK3α/β (Ser-21/9)-specific antibody. Cell Apoptosis Assays—An apoptosis enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Diagnostics) was used to quantitatively measure cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments (mononucleosomes and oligonucleosomes) in the untreated and treated MCF7 cells expressing various Akt constructs. This colorimetric enzyme immunoassay was performed as we reported previously (26Liu B. Fang M. Schmidt M. Lu Y. Mendelsohn J. Fan Z. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 82: 1991-1999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of apoptosis was further documented by detection of PARP cleavage in Western blotting analysis with an antibody that recognizes the cleaved PARP fragment. To determine whether Akt can autophosphorylate, we first performed an in vitro kinase assay using recombinant purified Akt1. Incubation of the pre-activated form of Akt1 recombinant protein with [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min in vitro resulted in marked radioactive phosphate incorporation into Akt (Fig. 1A). The level of Akt-associated radioactivity could be reduced by titration of [γ-32P]ATP with increasing amounts of unlabeled ATP added to the incubation mixture. This result strongly suggests that the Akt protein was autophosphorylated in vitro. To determine whether Akt autophosphorylation could occur between two Akt molecules (in trans), we modified the in vitro kinase assay by incubating the pre-activated Akt recombinant protein with a tagged-Akt protein that was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HisG tag antibody from MCF7 breast cancer cells transiently transfected with an Akt expression construct. After a 30-min kinase reaction in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, the immunoprecipitates were thoroughly washed to remove the pre-activated Akt recombinant protein and any residual [γ-32P]ATP. The immunoprecipitates were then resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. The controls for the experiment included immunoprecipitation with an anti-HisG antibody from the same cells transfected with the backbone expression vector pcDNA3.1 and a mock immunoprecipitation with an anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antibody from cells transfected with the HisG-tagged Akt expression construct. Compared with the controls, which retained a basal level of 32P radioactivity at the migrating position of the Akt protein after extensive washing of the protein A-Sepharose beads, the immunoprecipitates pulled down from HisG-tagged Akt-transfected cells by the anti-HisG antibody showed a statistically significant higher level of 32P radioactivity incorporation (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1B, upper gel, lane 4 versus lanes 2 or 5). An accompanying Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates showed that HisG-tagged Akt was successfully pulled down from lysates of the cells transfected with the HisG-Akt expression construct by the antibody (Fig. 1B, lower gel). In these experiments, it is unlikely that kinases other than the pre-activated Akt, which may be co-immunoprecipitated in the Akt immunoprecipitates, phosphorylated the immunoprecipitated Akt, because no phosphorylation was detected in the Akt immunoprecipitates when the pre-activated Akt was not added. Previous studies identified a consensus motif (RXRXX(S/T)) that Akt phosphorylates (24Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of this consensus motif can be detected with specific antibodies that recognize the motif when phosphorylated, which in fact has been used for identifying novel substrates of Akt (27Kane S. Sano H. Liu S.C. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Garner C.C. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22115-22118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Using Western blot analysis with a PAS-specific antibody, we detected a phosphorylated protein band in immunoprecipitates pulled down by the anti-HisG antibody from MCF7 cells transiently transfected with the HisG-tagged Akt expression construct (described in Fig. 1B) and stimulated with IGF-1 (Fig. 1C). Reprobing the same blot with an Akt antibody confirmed that the band detected by the anti-PAS antibody had the same migration position as Akt. We had a separate set of the immunoprecipitates that were incubated in vitro with unlabeled ATP for 30 min before further processing of the immunoprecipitates for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C, last two lanes). The signal detected by the PAS-specific antibody in the IGF-1-stimulated cells was higher than that in unstimulated cells (Fig. 1C). Taken together, our results support the observation that Akt may phosphorylate itself under certain circumstances. An analysis of the amino acid sequence of Akt indicated that there are two sites in Akt that conform to the Akt substrate phosphorylation motif (RXRXX(S/T)): threonine 72 (RPRPNT) and serine 246 (RERVFS) (Fig. 1D). With this information, we performed serial site-directed point mutations of Akt to generate specific Akt mutants wherein Thr-72 and Ser-246 were replaced by alanine, respectively, and concurrently. Constructs containing the mutants (Akt/T72A, Akt/S246A, and Akt/T72A/S246A) and the wild-type Akt construct were transiently expressed in MCF7 cells. The expressed proteins were immunoprecipitated with the anti-HisG antibody and were used as substrates for an in vitro Akt kinase in a manner similar to that described for Fig. 1B. Fig. 1E shows that, compared with the phosphorylation level of the wild-type Akt, mutation at Thr-72 or Ser-246 led to a statistically significantly reduced level of phosphorylation of the protein after incubation with the pre-activated Akt recombinant protein (p < 0.05 for both mutations) and that simultaneous mutation at both sites further decreased the level of phosphorylation (p < 0.01). The decrease of autophosphorylation of the Akt mutants indicates that both Thr-72 and Ser-246 may serve as putative sites of Akt autophosphorylation. To further demonstrate phosphorylation at these sites, we subjected the immunoprecipitates of the constructs transiently expressed in MCF7 cells to Western blot analysis with the PAS-specific antibody and Akt antibody described for Fig. 1C. The analysis showed that the levels of expression of the wild-type protein and the mutants were comparable (Fig. 1F, lower gel). However, compared with the result with the wild-type Akt, which showed a distinct protein band detected by Western blot analysis with the PAS-specific antibody, the signal detectable by the antibody was markedly reduced in the immunoprecipitates pulled down from the cells transfected with either of the Akt single mutants (Akt/T72A or Akt/S246), and no signal was detected in the immunoprecipitates from the cells transfected with the Akt dual mutant (Akt/T72A/S246A) (Fig. 1F, upper gel). To determine whether the two autophosphorylation sites that we identified in human Akt1 are widely conserved, we reviewed the relevant sequence data of Akt1 Thr-72 and Ser-246 among the human Akt isoforms as well as in mouse, rat, cow, chicken, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans. As indicated in Fig. 1G, the relevant motifs containing the two sites are similar among all three human Akt isoforms and are phylogenetically conserved across the species back to the birds. In human Akt2, Ser-246 is changed to Thr-248. In chicken Akt1 and human Akt3, the second Arg is substituted with an equivalent Lys, shown as RXXKXT; however, this remains an Akt phosphorylation consensus sequence. The two sites are not conserved in the more primitive organisms Drosophila or C. elegans (data not shown). This suggests that phosphorylation of these two sites (Thr-72 and Ser-246) is acquired during evolution in higher eukaryotes, and thus may not be as essential as the phosphorylation at Thr-308 and Ser-473 for the kinase activity of Akt. We next determined whether Thr-308/Ser-473 phosphorylation is required for Akt as a substrate for phosphorylation at Thr-72 and Ser-246 by examining the autophosphorylation of Akt in which Thr-308 and Ser-473 were mutated to a nonphosphorylatable amino acid, alanine (Akt/T308A/S473A). The constructs expressing wild-type Akt and Akt/T308A/S473A mutant were transiently transfected in MCF7 cells, and the expressed proteins were immunoprecipitated and subsequently processed for in vitro phosphorylation with the procedure described for Fig. 1 (B and E). We found that wild-type Akt protein and Akt/T308A/S473A mutant protein were immunoprecipitated at comparable levels (Fig. 2A, lower gel). However, compared with the results for the cells transfected with the wild-type Akt, the Akt/T308A/S473A mutant was phosphorylated at a remarkably lower level (Fig. 2A, upper gel, p < 0.01). This result suggests that phosphorylation of Thr-308/Ser-473 is a pre-requisite for the efficient autophosphorylation of Akt, at least in vitro. To further assess the role of Thr-308 and Ser-473 phosphorylation in determining the level of autophosphorylation of Akt at the Thr-72 and Ser-246 residues, we used the same method to examine the autophosphorylation of Akt in which Thr-308 and Ser-473 were replaced with aspartic acid (T308D/S473D), which mimics the constitutive phosphorylation status of the two sites by introduction of a negative charge. Despite comparable levels of expression of wild-type Akt and Akt/T308D/S473D mutant when the constructs were transiently expressed in MCF7 cells (Fig. 2B, inset), the protein levels of Akt/T308D/S473D mutant were much lower when immunoprecipitated with the same anti-HisG antibody (Fig. 2B). We speculate that this effect may be caused by a conformational change of the protein after experimental mutation of T308D and S473D that resulted in the His tag epitope being less accessible to the antibody. However, although the levels of Akt/T308D/S473D protein immunoprecipitated with the anti-HisG anti-body were much lower, an in vitro kinase assay showed marked auto-phosphorylation when the immunoprecipitates were incubated with the pre-activated Akt recombinant protein in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 2B). After normalization of Akt/T308D/S473D protein levels, autophosphorylation of Akt/T308D/S473D was statistically significantly higher than that of the wild-type Akt (p < 0.05), indicating the importance of Thr-308/Ser-473 phosphorylation in the modulation of Akt autophosphorylation. For further evidence that phosphorylation at Thr-308 and Ser-473 of the protein contribute to Akt autophosphorylation, we conducted an additional in vitro Akt kinase assay compare the autophosphorylation levels of Akt immunoprecipitated from IGF-1-stimulated and unstimulated MCF7 cells. Similar to the results with Akt/T308D/S473D, we found that the level of autophosphorylation was higher in Akt immunoprecipitated from IGF-1-stimulated cells than that from unstimulated cells, although the difference was moderate (Fig. 2C). A caveat is that, in this experiment, the autophosphorylation of Akt was catalyzed primarily by the pre-activated Akt recombinant protein in vitro other than the endogenous Akt, because there were only minimal increases in Akt autophosphorylation levels when the Akt proteins immunoprecipitated from the IGF-1-stimulated or unstimulated cells were incubated with only [γ-32P]ATP in vitro (without addition of the pre-activated Akt recombinant protein). Taken together, these data suggest that Akt auto-phosphorylation is enhanced when Thr-308 and Ser-473 are already phosphorylated, presumably because phosphorylation of these two sites conferred a conformational change that increased access for cross-phosphorylation of Akt by another Akt molecule. A critical question is whether autophosphorylation of Akt at Thr-72 and Ser-246 plays a role in Akt activity. To answer this question, we explored potential differences in kinase activity between wild-type Akt and Akt mutants (Akt/T72A, Akt/S246A, and Akt/T72A/S246A) in response to stimulation with IGF-1 when the constructs were transiently expressed in MCF7 cells. With the use of GSK3 peptide as a substrate, all three Akt mutants exhibited remarkably reduced kinase activity in both IGF-1-stimulated and unstimulated cells compared with wild-type Akt (Fig. 3A). These results indicate that autophosphorylation of Akt at Thr-72 and Ser-246 is critical for the overall kinase activity of Akt. Previous studies showed that the PH domain of Akt is important during the Akt activation process, because it directs the molecule to the membrane proximity for the required phosphorylation by upstream kinases, when there is an increased level of 3-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositols in cells after exposure to external stimuli that activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Our present observations suggest that the PH domain plays additional roles in the activity of Akt, because it harbors an important autophosphorylation site, Thr-72. To provide further insight into the role of the PH domain, we compared the kinase activity of a full-length Akt and a PH domain-deleted Akt, both of which were constructed to contain an N-terminal myristoylation sequence that preserves the potential for membrane anchorage for constitutive phosphorylation and activation without the PH domain (28Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Ahmed N.N. Datta K. Malstrom S. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Feng J. Tsichlis P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 29Andjelkovic M. Maira S.M. Cron P. Parker P.J. Hemmings B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5061-5072Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Vectors without any insert (backbone) or constructed with full-length wild-type Akt were used as controls. Fig. 3B shows the protein levels and kinase activities of myristoylated Akt (Myr-Akt), myristoylated Akt without PH domain (Myr-Δ PH-Akt), and wild-type Akt, all of which were transiently expressed in MCF7 cells at comparable levels. As expected, wild-type Akt showed a marked increase in Akt kinase activity after stimulation of the cells with IGF-1, but the kinase activity of Myr-Akt and Myr-Δ PH-Akt did not increase after IGF-1 stimulation because of the fusion of the N-terminal myristoylation sequence in these molecules. The kinase activity of Myr-Akt was much stronger than that of Myr-Δ PH-Akt, whereas the expression levels of these two proteins were comparable. Taken together, these results suggest that the PH domain has an important function in addition to recruiting Akt to the membrane proximity. To further correlate this potentially important role of Akt autophosphorylation with its overall biologic activity, we evaluated the anti-apoptotic activity of the autophosphorylation-deficient Akt mutants (Akt/T72A, Akt/S246A, and Akt/T72A/S246A) in MCF7 cells after doxorubicin treatment. We used two independent assays for measuring the levels of apoptosis in the cells after treatment, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that quantitatively measures the levels of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments in apoptotic cells and a Western blot analysis that detects that levels of cleavage of PARP during apoptosis. Compared with the cells transfected with the control vector, cells that were transfected with and expressed wild-type Akt markedly decreased the level of doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in MCF7 cells; however, expression of the Akt mutants, particularly Akt/T72A/S246A, had statistically significant less effect on reducing the levels of apoptosis by doxorubicin in the cells (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4A). These results are consistent with the findings shown in Fig. 3 that the autophosphorylation-deficient Akt mutants have decreased enzymatic activity. Over the past decade, the regulation of Akt by phosphorylation has been extensively studied. The consensus view is that Akt is regulated primarily by phosphorylation at two critical sites, Thr-308 in the activation segment and Ser-473 in the hydrophobic motif terminus. On the basis of our findings from in vitro kinase assays with serial cell-based biochemical assays through expression of transfected wild-type and point-mutated Akt constructs, we propose a novel mode of Akt activation in which the kinase activity of Akt is augmented via a regulatory mechanism by autophosphorylation in trans at two distinct sites of the molecule located in the PH domain and kinase domain, respectively. Our data suggest that the autophosphorylation of Akt at Thr-72 and Ser-246 residues is subsequent to and dependent on phosphorylation of the Thr-308 and Ser-473 residues of the molecule by the upstream kinases. The results also suggest that autophosphorylation at Thr-72 and Ser-246 residues is critical for the transduction of the signals that activate Akt, because the kinase activity of Akt is substantially decreased without subsequent autophosphorylation at these residues. This mode of autophosphorylation is conceptually different from spontaneous autophosphorylation of a kinase, which may arise intramolecularly and may occur even in catalytically inactive mutants. Our current data point to a potential new mechanism by which Akt regulates its kinase activity via autophosphorylation in trans. Because the experimental approach we used was largely based on in vitro kinase assays, a few caveats concerning potential experimental artifacts are worth discussing. Could the autophosphorylation of Akt actually be caused by a “contaminating” component along with the recombinant Akt protein, such as phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 and MAPKAP2, which were used to pre-activate the recombinant Akt? Despite the purity assurance of analysis by the vendor, contamination is theoretically possible for the experiments in which the pre-activated Akt recombinant protein was used as the kinase. However, this is unlikely for the reason that if the Akt-associated incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP was indeed caused by a contaminating enzyme, such as phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 or MAPKAP2, no significant difference in protein phosphorylation should have been detected between wild-type Akt and Akt mutants (Akt/T72A, Akt/S246A, and Akt/T72A/S246A), because these enzymes do not phosphorylate Thr-72/Ser-246, and mutation of the two sites would not therefore alter the levels of phosphorylation of the protein. Furthermore, the autophosphorylation of Akt was independently verified by Western blot analysis using an anti-PAS antibody of the extracts of cell after IGF-1 stimulation; the process did not involve the use of the pre-activated recombinant Akt protein at all. A critical study that needs to be performed is the evaluation and demonstration of the stoichiometry of phosphorylation on the Thr-72A and Ser-246A residues in vivo with respect to the kinase activity of Akt. The phosphorylation stoichiometry of Akt phosphorylation on Thr-308 and Ser-473 is already well established. Preparation of phosphorylation site-specific antibodies will be very useful in demonstrating the stoichiometry of phosphorylation on these two sites. These antibodies can be used to evaluate how these novel sites respond to stimulation of cells by growth factors and to treatment with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors such as wortmannin and LY-294002. Use of tandem mass spectrometric analysis for identifying the specific amino acids phosphorylated in cells has become common in recent years (30Carter M.D. Southwick K. Lukov G. Willardson B.M. Thulin C.D. J. Biomol. Tech. 2004; 15: 257-264PubMed Google Scholar). This approach may be used to further verify the two phosphorylation sites (Thr-72 and Ser-246) of Akt in cells after expression of transfected wild-type Akt and Akt mutants as well as these sites in cells that express endogenous Akt after stimulation. The specificity and efficiency of Akt autophosphorylation on these two sites may also be verified by in vitro peptide competition assays. Synthetic peptides containing Thr-72 and Ser-246 could not only be tested in competition with the wild-type Akt when incubated with pre-activated Akt recombinant protein during in vitro kinase assays but may also be used to ascertain whether they serve effectively as substrates by comparing phosphorylation rates to the classic GSK3 cross-tide that we used in the experiment illustrated in Fig. 3. These approaches will also provide valuable information on the stoichiometry of phosphorylation on these two predicted sites and will allow comparison with the well established phosphorylation stoichiometry of Thr-308 and Ser-473. Lastly, additional studies may include investigation of the location of these two sites in the crystal structure of the PH domain and the kinase domain to establish the likelihood of these domains being available or exposed for phosphorylation. In conclusion, the results from our pilot studies suggest that Akt regulates its kinase activity through autophosphorylation in trans. Our findings warrant further investigation of this potential important mechanism of Akt kinase regulation. We thank Elizabeth L.

https://openalex.org/W2171796458,"AApoAII amyloid fibrils have exhibited prion-like transmissibility in mouse senile amyloidosis. We have demonstrated that AApoAII is extremely active and can induce amyloidosis following doses less than 1 pg. We tested physical and chemical methods to disrupt AApoAII fibrils in vitro as determined by thioflavin T binding and electron microscopy (EM) as well as inactivating the transmissibility of AApoAII fibrils in vivo. Complete disruption of AApoAII fibrils was achieved by treatment with formic acid, 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, and autoclaving in an alkaline solution. Injection of these disrupted AApoAII fibrils did not induce amyloidosis in mice. Disaggregation with 6 M urea, autoclaving, and alkaline solution was incomplete, and injection of these AApoAII fibrils induced mild amyloidosis. Treatment with formalin, delipidation, freeze-thaw, and RNase did not have any major effect. A distinct correlation was obtained between the amounts of amyloid fibrils and the transmissibility of amyloid fibrils, thereby indicating the essential role of fibril conformation for transmission of amyloidosis. We also studied the inactivation of AApoAII fibrils by several organic compounds in vitro and in vivo. AApoAII amyloidosis provides a valuable system for studying factors that may prevent transmission of amyloid disease as well as potential novel therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2094164672,"The assembly of proteins in the peroxisomal membrane is a multistep process requiring their recognition in the cytosol, targeting to and insertion into the peroxisomal membrane, and stabilization within the lipid bilayer. The peroxin Pex19p has been proposed to be either the receptor that recognizes and targets newly synthesized peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMP) to the peroxisome or a chaperone required for stabilization of PMPs at the peroxisomal membrane. Differentiating between these two roles for Pex19p could be achieved by determining whether the peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS) and the region of Pex19p binding of a PMP are the same or different. We addressed the role for Pex19p in the assembly of two PMPs, Pex30p and Pex32p, of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Pex30p and Pex32p control peroxisome size and number but are dispensable for peroxisome formation. Systematic truncations from the carboxyl terminus, together with in-frame deletions of specific regions, have identified PTSs essential for targeting Pex30p and Pex32p to peroxisomes. Both Pex30p and Pex32p interact with Pex19p in regions that do not overlap with their PTSs. However, Pex19p is required for localizing Pex30p and Pex32p to peroxisomes, because mutations that disrupt the interaction of Pex19p with Pex30p and Pex32p lead to their mislocalization to a compartment other than peroxisomes. Mutants of Pex30p and Pex32p that localize to peroxisomes but produce cells exhibiting the peroxisomal phenotypes of cells lacking these proteins demonstrate that the regions in these proteins that control peroxisomal targeting and cell biological activity are separable. Together, our data show that the interaction of Pex19p with Pex30p and Pex32p is required for their roles in peroxisome biogenesis and are consistent with a chaperone role for Pex19p in stabilizing or maintaining membrane proteins in peroxisomes.

Mutants of Pex30p and Pex32p that localize to peroxisomes but produce cells exhibiting the peroxisomal phenotypes of cells lacking these proteins demonstrate that the regions in these proteins that control peroxisomal targeting and cell biological activity are separable. Together, our data show that the interaction of Pex19p with Pex30p and Pex32p is required for their roles in peroxisome biogenesis and are consistent with a chaperone role for Pex19p in stabilizing or maintaining membrane proteins in peroxisomes. The synthesis of nuclear-encoded proteins begins in the cytosol. A protein that is destined for an organelle is directed from the cytosol to the organelle by a sequence or sequences within the protein that contain information essential for targeting the protein to the organelle. These sequences are recognized by receptors in the cytosol or at the target membrane. Having arrived at its specific organelle, the protein is then either translocated across the organelle membrane or inserted into the membrane lipid bilayer. Peroxisomes are ubiquitous organelles that perform a variety of essential biochemical functions, notably in fatty acid metabolism. Mature peroxisomes usually appear as spherical structures in electron micrographs, with diameters of 0.5-1.0 μm, and surrounded by a single membrane. All of the peroxisomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes, synthesized on cytoplasmic polysomes, and posttranslationally targeted to the peroxisome. They are sorted to the peroxisome by specific peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS). 3The abbreviations used are: PTS, peroxisomal targeting signal; 20KgP, 20,000 × g supernatant fraction enriched for cytosol; 20KgS, 20,000 × g pellet fraction enriched for peroxisomes; NLS, nuclear localization signal; PMP, peroxisomal membrane protein; prA, protein A; AD, activating domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein; BD, DNA-binding domain. PTSs are recognized in the cytosol by their cognate receptors, which direct the targeting and docking of proteins at the peroxisome membrane. Most peroxisomal matrix proteins are targeted by PTS1, an extreme carboxyl-terminal tripeptide consisting prototypically of Ser-Lys-Leu, and its shuttling receptor, the peroxin (protein required for peroxisome assembly) Pex5p. Strikingly, Pex5p has been shown to enter the peroxisome matrix together with its cargo and to recycle back to the cytosol following dissociation from its cargo. A few matrix proteins are targeted by PTS2, an amino-terminal nonapeptide, and its cytosolic shuttling receptor, Pex7p, whereas a limited number of matrix proteins are targeted by largely uncharacterized internal PTSs (reviewed in Refs. 1Lazarow P.B.

The direct insertion of PMPs into the peroxisomal membrane is facilitated by Pex19p, a peroxin that is localized predominantly to the cytosol and to a much lesser extent at the surface of peroxisomes (17Kammerer S.

Pex19p interacts essentially with all PMPs via a consensus motif that is found at least once in a PMP (20Sacksteder K.A. Jones J.M. South S.T. Li X. Liu Y. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 931-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 21Rottensteiner H. Kramer A. Lorenzen S. Stein K. Landgraf C. Volkmer-Engert R. Erdmann R. Mol. Biol.

The interaction of Pex19p and a PMP could either prevent the aggregation of the PMP or serve to guide the PMP to the peroxisomal membrane. Accordingly, Pex19p has been proposed to function either as an import receptor for PMPs or as a chaperone acting in the assembly or stabilization of PMPs at the peroxisomal membrane (20Sacksteder K.A.

Here, we address the role of Pex19p in the assembly of two PMPs, Pex30p and Pex32p, of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (27Vizeacoumar F.J. Torres-Guzman J.C. Bouard D. Aitchison J.D. Rachubinski R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Pex30p and Pex32p represent excellent candidates with which to study the role of Pex19p in PMP targeting or assembly at the peroxisomal membrane, because Pex30p and Pex32p control peroxisome number and size but are dispensable for peroxisome formation and function (27Vizeacoumar F.J. Torres-Guzman J.C. Bouard D. Aitchison J.D. Rachubinski R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), whereas the absence or mislocalization of most PMPs results in cells that are unable to form functional peroxisomes (the classical pex phenotype). We show that although Pex30p and Pex32p interact with Pex19p in regions that do not overlap with their experimentally identified PTSs, Pex19p is still required to localize Pex30p and Pex32p to peroxisomes. Pex30p and Pex32p mutants that localize to peroxisomes but produce cells exhibiting the peroxisomal phenotypes of cells lacking these proteins demonstrate that the regions in Pex30p and Pex32p controlling their peroxisomal targeting and cell biological activity are separable. Our results show that Pex30p and Pex32p must interact with Pex19p to function in peroxisome biogenesis and are consistent with Pex19p acting as a chaperone to stabilize or maintain Pex30p and Pex32p at the peroxisomal membrane.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) and electron microscopy (34Eitzen G.A. Szilard R.K. Rachubinski R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Two-hybrid Analysis—Physical interactions between Pex19p and full-length or partial constructs of Pex30p or Pex32p were detected using the Matchmaker two-hybrid system (BD Biosciences Clontech). Chimeric genes were made by amplifying the sequences encoding Pex19p and full-length or partial constructs of Pex30p or Pex32p and ligating them in-frame and downstream of the DNA encoding the transcription-activating domain (AD) and the DNA-binding domain (BD) of the GAL4 transcriptional activator in the plasmids pGAD424 and pGBT9, respectively. Cells of S. cerevisiae strain HF7c were transformed simultaneously with a pGAD424-derived plasmid and a pGBT9-derived plasmid. Transformants were grown on synthetic minimal agar medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. Growth on this medium indicates an interaction between two chimeric proteins. Subcellular Fractionation and Isolation of Peroxisomes—Subcellular fractionation of oleic acid-incubated cells was done as described (28Smith J.J. Marelli M. Christmas R.H. Vizeacoumar F.J.

Peroxisomes were purified from the 20KgP fraction by isopycnic density centrifugation on Nycodenz gradients (28Smith J.J. Marelli M. Christmas R.H. Vizeacoumar F.J. Dilworth D.J. Ideker T.

Antibodies—Antibodies to peroxisomal thiolase have been described (35Eitzen G.A. Titorenko V.I. Smith J.J. Veenhuis M. Szilard R.K. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20300-20306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Protein A chimeras were detected by immunoblotting with affinity-purified rabbit antibodies against mouse IgG (Jackson). Analytical Procedures—Extraction of nucleic acid from yeast lysates and manipulation of DNA were performed as described (36Ausubel F.J. Brent R. Kinston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY1994Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed using a wet transfer system (36Ausubel F.J. Brent R. Kinston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY1994Google Scholar), and antigen-antibody complexes in immunoblots were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Protein concentration was determined using a commercially available kit (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as standard. Amino Acids 230-250 of Pex30p and 159-179 of Pex32p Function as Peroxisomal Targeting Signals—Pex30p and Pex32p are two recently identified integral PMPs of S. cerevisiae that are not required for the formation of peroxisomes per se but that regulate the number and size of peroxisomes (27Vizeacoumar F.J. Torres-Guzman J.C. Bouard D. Aitchison J.D. Rachubinski R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Pex30p and Pex32p are 523 and 413 amino acids in length, respectively. To delineate sequences within Pex30p and Pex32p required for their targeting to peroxisomes, we constructed strains expressing genomically integrated constructs of Pex30p or Pex32p progressively truncated at their carboxyl termini and tagged at their carboxyl termini with either protein A for biochemical analysis or GFP for analysis by confocal microscopy. Subcellular fractionation demonstrated that full-length Pex30p or Pex32p preferentially associated with a 20KgP fraction enriched for peroxisomes and not a 20KgS fraction enriched for cytosol (Fig. 1). The truncated proteins Pex30(1-282)p and Pex30(1-250)p also preferentially associated with the 20KgP fraction. Further truncations of Pex30p accumulated primarily in the 20KgS fraction (Fig. 1A), suggesting that information for targeting Pex30p to peroxisomes is present between amino acids 230 and 250. In the case of Pex32p, the truncated forms Pex32(1-203)p and Pex32(1-179)p, like full-length Pex32p, preferentially localized to the 20KgP fraction enriched for peroxisomes. Pex32p (1-159)p preferentially accumulated in the 20KgS fraction (Fig. 1B), suggesting that information for targeting Pex32p to peroxisomes lies between amino acids 159 and 179. A carboxyl-terminal PTS1 is sufficient to direct a reporter protein to peroxisomes. A fluorescent chimera between Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein (DsRed) and the PTS1 Ser-Lys-Leu has been shown to target to peroxisomes of S. cerevisiae (28Smith J.J. Marelli M. Christmas R.H. Vizeacoumar F.J. Dilworth D.J. Ideker T. Galitski T. Dimitrov K. Rachubinski R.A. Aitchison J.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 37Wang X. Unruh M.J. Goodman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10897-10905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Genomically encoded chimeras of full-length and truncated forms of Pex30p and Pex32p linked to GFP at their carboxyl termini were localized in oleic acid-incubated cells by fluorescence microscopy with DsRed-PTS1 to identify peroxisomes (Fig. 2, A and B). Full-length Pex30p and the truncations Pex30(1-282)p and Pex30(1-250)p colocalized preferentially with DsRed-SKL to punctate structures characteristic of peroxisomes (Fig. 2A). In contrast, Pex30p (1-230)p showed an extensive amount of generalized fluorescence characteristic of the cytosol, whereas Pex30(1-170)p showed an almost exclusive cytosolic localization (Fig. 2A). Full-length Pex32p and the truncations Pex32(1-203)p and Pex32(1-179)p colocalized with DsRed-SKL to punctate structures, whereas Pex32(1-159)p showed a generalized cytosolic fluorescence (Fig. 2B). Thus, both subcellular fractionation and microscopy showed that information for targeting Pex30p and Pex32p to peroxisomes lies within a stretch of 20 amino acids between amino acids 230 and 250 in Pex30p"

Regulation of the EKI1-encoded ethanolamine kinase by the essential nutrient zinc was examined in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The level of ethanolamine kinase activity increased when zinc was depleted from the growth medium. This regulation correlated with increases in the CDP-ethanolamine pathway intermediates phosphoethanolamine and CDP-ethanolamine, and an increase in the methylated derivative of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine. The β-galactosidase activity driven by the PEKI1-lacZ reporter gene was elevated in zinc-depleted cells, indicating that the increase in ethanolamine kinase activity was attributed to a transcriptional mechanism. The expression level of PEKI1-lacZ reporter gene activity in the zrt1Δzrt2Δ mutant (defective in plasma membrane zinc transport) cells grown with zinc was similar to the activity expressed in wild-type cells grown without zinc. This indicated that EKI1 expression was sensitive to intracellular zinc. The zinc-mediated regulation of EKI1 expression was attenuated in the zap1Δ mutant defective in the zinc-regulated transcription factor Zap1p. Direct interactions between Zap1p and putative zinc-responsive elements in the EKI1 promoter were demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Mutations of these elements to a nonconsensus sequence abolished Zap1p-DNA interactions. Taken together, this work demonstrated that the zinc-mediated regulation of ethanolamine kinase and the synthesis of phospholipids via the CDP-ethanolamine branch of the Kennedy pathway were controlled in part by Zap1p.

Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The essential nature of zinc stems from the role it plays as a cofactor for hundreds of enzymes and from its role as a structural constituent of some proteins (23Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol.

Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, the cellular levels of zinc are largely controlled by plasma membrane zinc transporters (Zrt1p, Zrt2p, Fet4p) (26Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Most of these zinc transporters are regulated at the transcriptional level to maintain zinc homeostasis (35Eide D.J. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 1532S-1535SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, when the cellular level of zinc is limiting, the expression of the high affinity zinc transporter Zrt1p is induced for increased zinc uptake, but when the cellular level of zinc is high, the expression of Zrt1p is repressed to attenuate zinc uptake (26Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The increase in Zrt1p expression is dependent on the transcription factor Zap1p, which interacts with a UASZRE in the promoter of the ZRT1 gene to activate transcription (26Zhao H. Eide D. Proc.

Interestingly, phospholipid metabolism is regulated by the cellular level of zinc in S. cerevisiae (4Iwanyshyn W.M. Han G.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

In fact, the DPP1 gene, which encodes the vacuole membrane-associated diacylglycerol pyrophosphate phosphatase enzyme, 3The diacylglycerol pyrophosphate phosphatase enzyme catalyzes the dephosphorylation of the β-phosphate from diacylglycerol pyrophosphate to form phosphatidate, and then removes the phosphate from phosphatidate to form diacylglycerol (68Wu W.-I.

Genetics. 2000; 156: 45-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The induction of diacylglycerol pyrophosphate phosphatase expression in zinc-depleted cells results in reduced levels of the minor vacuole membrane phospholipids diacylglycerol pyrophosphate and phosphatidate (40Han G.-S. Johnston C.N. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5338-5345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Moreover, the cellular level of zinc regulates the synthesis of the major membrane phospholipids in S. cerevisiae (4Iwanyshyn W.M. Han G.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

The activity levels of the CDP-diacylglycerol pathway enzymes PS synthase, PS decarboxylase, and the phospholipid methyltransferases are reduced in zinc-depleted cells (4Iwanyshyn W.M. Han G.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21976-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In contrast, the activity of the CDP-diacylglycerol branch point enzyme PI synthase is elevated in response to zinc depletion (4Iwanyshyn W.M. Han G.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

For the PS synthase enzyme, the repression of CHO1 transcription is mediated by the phospholipid synthesis transcription factor Opi1p (4Iwanyshyn W.M. Han G.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21976-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For the PI synthase enzyme, the induction of PIS1 transcription is mediated by Zap1p (43Han S.-H.

The induction of PI synthase activity correlates with an increase in PI content, whereas the repression of PS synthase and PS decarboxylase activities correlate with a decrease in PE content (4Iwanyshyn W.M. Han G.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21976-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although the activities of the phospholipid methyltransferases (that methylate PE to form PC) are repressed in zinc-depleted cells, this growth condition does not have a major effect on PC content (4Iwanyshyn W.M. Han G.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21976-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this work, we examined the contribution of the CDP-ethanolamine branch of the Kennedy pathway for the reduction in PE content in response to zinc depletion. We focused on the regulation of the EKI1-encoded ethanolamine kinase, the enzyme that catalyzes the committed step in the CDP-ethanolamine pathway. Unexpectedly, we found that the expression of ethanolamine kinase activity, and the CDP-ethanolamine pathway was induced upon zinc depletion. In addition, this growth condition resulted in an increase in PC derived from PE synthesized via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway. The induction of ethanolamine kinase activity was attributed to a transcriptional mechanism that was mediated in part by the Zap1p transcription factor. Materials—All chemicals were reagent grade.

Saturated cultures were diluted into zinc-free medium at an initial concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml, and grown for 24 h. Cultures were then diluted to 1 × 106 cells/ml and grown in zinc-free medium containing 0 or 1.5 μm zinc sulfate. This growth routine was used to deplete internal stores of zinc (5Han G.-S.

Plasmid maintenance and amplification were performed in Escherichia coli strain DH5α. E. coli cells were grown in LB medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl, pH 7.4) at 37 °C. Ampicillin (100 μg/ml) was added to bacterial cultures that carried plasmids. For growth on plates, yeast and bacterial media were supplemented with 2% and 1.5% agar, respectively. Yeast cell numbers in liquid medium were determined spectrophotometrically at an absorbance of 600 nm. Exponential phase cells were harvested at a density of 1.5 × 107 cells/ml. Glassware were washed with Liqui-Nox, rinsed with 0.1 mm EDTA, and then rinsed several times with deionized distilled water to remove zinc contamination.TABLE 1Strains and plasmids used in this workStrain or plasmidGenotype or relevant characteristicsSource or Ref.E. coliDH5αF- ϕ80dlacZΔM15 Δ(lacZYA-argF)U169 deoR recA1 endA1 hdR17(rk- mk+) phoA supE44 l-thi-1 gyrA96 relA146Sambrook J.

Yeast cells were disrupted with glass beads with a Mini-BeadBeater-8 (Biospec Products) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin (48Klig L.S. Homann M.J. Carman G.M. Henry S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glass beads and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was used as the cell extract. The concentration of protein in cell extracts was estimated by the method of Bradford (49Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217399) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Enzyme Assays—Ethanolamine kinase activity was measured for 40 min at 30 °C by following the phosphorylation of [1,2-14C]ethanolamine (20,000 cpm/nmol) with ATP. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, 5 mm ethanolamine, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm MgSO4, and enzyme protein (0.12 mg/ml) in a final volume of 25 μl. Reaction mixtures were separated by thin layer chromatography on potassium oxalate-impregnated silica gel plates using the solvent system of methanol/0.6% sodium chloride/29.2% ammonium hydroxide (10: 10:1) (50Elabbadi N. Ancelin M.L. Vial H.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The position of the labeled phosphoethanolamine on chromatograms was visualized by phosphorimaging and compared with a phosphoethanolamine standard. The amount of labeled product was determined by scintillation counting. β-Galactosidase activity was determined by measuring the conversion of O-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside to O-nitrophenol (molar extinction coefficient of 3500 m–1 cm–1) by following the increase in absorbance at 410 nm on a recording spectrophotometer (51Craven G.R. Steers E. Jr-Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 2468-2477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 3 mm O-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and enzyme protein in a total volume of 0.1 ml. A unit of ethanolamine kinase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 nmol of product/min. A unit of β-galactosidase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol product/min. All assays were performed in triplicate and were linear with time and protein concentration. Specific activity was defined as units per mg of protein. Labeling and Analysis of CDP-ethanolamine Pathway Intermediates and Phospholipids—Exponential phase cells were labeled for five to six generations with [1,2-14C]ethanolamine (0.5 μCi/ml). The CDP-ethanolamine pathway intermediates and phospholipids were extracted from whole cells by a chloroform/methanol/water extraction, followed by the separation of the aqueous and chloroform phases (52Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43093) Google Scholar). The aqueous phase was neutralized, dried in vacuo, and the residue was dissolved in deionized water. Samples were subjected to centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 3 min to remove insoluble material. The 14C-labeled CDP-ethanolamine pathway intermediates were then separated by thin-layer chromatography on silica gel plates using the solvent system methanol/0.6% sodium chloride/ammonium hydroxide (10:10:1, v/v). 14C-labeled phospholipids, which were contained in the chloroform phase, were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography on silica gel plates using the solvent system chloroform/pyridine/88% formic acid/methanol/water (60:35:10:5:2, v/v). The positions of the labeled compounds on chromatograms were determined by phosphorimaging and compared with standards. The amount of each labeled compound was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—The double-stranded oligonucleotides used in the electrophoretic mobility shift assays are presented in Table 2. They were prepared by annealing 25 μm complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides in a reaction mixture (0.1 ml) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. The annealing reactions were incubated for 5 min at 100 °C in a heat block, and then kept in the heat block for another 2 h after it had been turned off. The annealed oligonucleotides (100 pmol), which had a 5′ overhanging end, were labeled with [α-32P]dTTP (400–800 Ci/nmol) and Klenow fragment (5 units) for 30 min at room temperature. Labeled oligonucleotides were separated from unincorporated nucleotides by gel filtration using ProbeQuant G-50 spin columns.TABLE 2Oligonucleotides used for electrophoretic mobility shift assaysElementAnnealed oligonucleotidesaUnderlined sequences are putative ZRE sites.

The indicated amounts of GST-Zap1p687–880 were incubated with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.025 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.04% IGEPAL CA-630, 10% glycerol, and 1 pmol of radiolabeled DNA probe (2.5 × 105 cpm/pmol) for 15 min at room temperature in a total volume of 10 μl. The reaction mixtures were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide gels (1.5-mm thickness) in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer at 100 V for 45 min. Gels were dried onto blotting paper, and the radioactive signals were visualized by phosphorimaging analysis. Data Analysis—Statistical significance was determined by performing the Student's t test using SigmaPlot software. p values < 0.05 were taken as a significant difference. Effect of Zinc Depletion on Ethanolamine Kinase Activity and on the Incorporation of Ethanolamine into CDP-ethanolamine Pathway Intermediates and Phospholipids—The effect of zinc depletion on ethanolamine kinase activity was examined. For this and subsequent experiments, the growth medium lacked inositol supplementation to preclude the regulatory effects that inositol has on the regulation of phospholipid synthesis (6Carman G.M.

https://openalex.org/W2098601281,"The ColE7 operon is an SOS response regulon, which encodes bacteriocin ColE7 to kill susceptible Escherichia coli and its related enterobacteria under conditions of stress. We have observed for the first time that polyamines confer limited resistance against ColE7 on E. coli cells. Thus, this study aims to investigate the role of polyamines in modulating the protective effect of the E. coli cells against colicin. In the experiments, we surprisingly found that endogenous polyamines are also essential for ColE7 production, and the rate of polyamine synthesis is directly related to the SOS response. Our experimental results further indicated that exogenous polyamines suppress the expression of TolA, BtuB, OmpF, and OmpC proteins that are responsible for ColE7 uptake. Moreover, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that the production of two periplasmic proteins, PotD and OppA, is increased in E. coli cells under ColE7 exposure. Based on these observations, we propose that endogenous polyamines may play a dual role in the ColE7 system. Polyamines may participate in initiating the expression of the SOS response of the ColE7 operon and simultaneously down-regulate proteins that are essential for colicin uptake, thus conferring a survival advantage on colicin-producing E. coli under stress conditions in the natural environment.

Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) are aliphatic cations ubiquitous to all living organisms (1Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). They have been shown to affect membrane permeability, gene expression, intracellular signaling, and apoptosis through noncovalent interactions or specific conjugation with proteins, nucleic acids, phospholipids, and other acidic substances (2Bachrach U. Wang Y.C. Tabib A. News Physiol. Sci. 2001; 16: 106-109PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bolter B. Soll J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 935-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 4Yoshida M. Kashiwagi K.

Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Because of their important regulatory functions, the biosynthesis, degradation, uptake, and excretion of polyamines are stringently regulated in order to maintain appropriate cellular levels (6Igarashi K. Ito K. Kashiwagi K. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 7Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Recently, polyamines have been shown to mediate the production of RecA, which together with LexA controls the SOS response regulon (8Kim I.G. Oh T.J. Toxicol. Lett. 2000; 116: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9Oh T.J. Kim I.G. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1999; 15: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 10Oh T.J. Kim I.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 584-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Polyamines are also known to modulate the gating of ion channels such as N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors of neurons and the bacteria outer membrane porins OmpF, OmpC, and PhoE (11Liu N. Benedik M.J. Delcour A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1326: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12Iyer R. Wu Z. Woster P.M. Delcour A.H. J. Mol.

In this modulation, putrescine and spermidine have been shown to bind to the aspartic acid residues located at positions 113 and 121 of OmpF and position 105 of OmpC, altering the charge and pore size of these porins and membrane permeability of E. coli cells (12Iyer R. Wu Z. Woster P.M. Delcour A.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 933-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 14Dela Vega A.L. Delcour A.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3715-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Bacteriocins are one of the most abundant and diverse classes of antimicrobial toxins produced by all major lineages of eubacteria and archaebacteria (15Riley M.A. Wertz J.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 117-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). The major function of bacteriocins appears to mediate population dynamics within species. One class of bacteriocins, the colicins produced by Escherichia coli, have served as the model for exploring the ecological role of these potent toxins (16Riley M.A. Gordon D.M. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 129-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). All colicins found to date are plasmid-encoded. For example, the colicin E7 (ColE7) operon contains cea, cei, and cel genes located on a 6.2-kb native plasmid (pColE7-K317) (17Lu F.M. Chak K.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The ColE7 operon is transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA in the order cea-cei-cel by the ColE7 promoter that has two SOS boxes (ATCTGTACATAAAACCAGTGGTTTTATGTACAGAT) located in an inverted repeat orientation and is regulated by the LexA repressor (17Lu F.M. Chak K.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cea is a toxin structural gene, which encodes the DNase ColE7 of 576 amino acid residues, and the product of cei gene composed of 87 amino acids is the ColE7 inhibitor (Im7). Im7 binds to the C-terminal DNase (T2A) domain of ColE7 forming a ColE7-Im7 complex and keeps ColE7 inactive inside the ColE7 producers (18Ku W.Y. Liu Y.W. Hsu Y.C. Liao C.C. Liang P.H. Yuan H.S. Chak K.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1670-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Ko T.P. Liao C.C. Ku W.Y. Chak K.F. Yuan H.S. Structure. 1999; 7: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In addition, the cei gene is also transcribed independently from its own constitutive promoter that is active at a low level (20Soong B.W. Hsieh S.Y. Chak K.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The cel gene encodes the lysis protein (Lys-7) for ColE7 secretion. Lys-7 is translated as a 47-amino acid precursor and then processed to a mature form of 28 amino acids (21Chak K.F. Kuo W.S. Lu F.M. James R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The translocation mechanism of colicin across the membrane of E. coli and the mode of action of ColE7 have been well documented (22Lazdunski C. Bouveret E. Rigal A. Journet L. Lloubes R. Benedetti H. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 290: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 23James R. Kleanthous C. Moore G.R.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4993-5002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once ColE7 binds to the outer membrane receptor BtuB through its internal receptor binding (R) domain, it further translocates into the envelope of susceptible cells through interactions between the N-terminal membrane translocation (T) domain and the outer membrane porins OmpF or OmpC as well as the Tol/Pal translocation system, which consists of the TolA, TolB, TolQ, TolR, and Pal proteins (22Lazdunski C. Bouveret E. Rigal A. Journet L. Lloubes R. Benedetti H. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 290: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 24Lazdunski C.J. Bouveret E. Rigal A. Journet L. Lloubes R. Benedetti H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4993-5002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, the DNase T2A domain extends into the periplasmic space. The T2A domain of ColE7 is then cleaved from the rest of the colicin and transported into the cytoplasm to hydrolyze the chromosome of susceptible cells (25Liao C.C. Hsiao K.C. Liu Y.W. Leng P.H. Yuen H.S. Chak K.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 26de Zamaroczy M. Mora L. Lecuyer A. Geli V. Buckingham R.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 159-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It has been claimed that proteins interacting with colicins during translocation are all indispensable for colicin uptake (22Lazdunski C. Bouveret E. Rigal A. Journet L. Lloubes R. Benedetti H. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 290: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 27James R. Penfold C.N. Moore G.R. Kleanthous C. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this study, we use ColE7 as a research model to investigate the roles of polyamines in the ColE7 production and the ColE7 transportation. We found for the first time that endogenous polyamines are essential for triggering ColE7 production under mitomycin C induction. We also found that both endogenous polyamines and exogenous spermidine render limited resistance to E. coli cells against ColE7, suggesting that polyamines play a role in restricting colicin translocation across the E. coli cell membrane. By using this ColE7 model, we have demonstrated in E. coli that the presence of endogenous polyamines induces ColE7 production but restricts ColE7 uptake. Thus, the ecological role of polyamines in conferring survival advantages for a colicin-producing cell is discussed. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Bacterial Cultures—E. coli strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Strain W3110 was purchased from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). M15(pREP4), JM101, and JM109 were from our own collections and were used as hosts for expression of recombinant proteins. Polyamine-deficient mutants HT306, HT414, and HT375 were obtained from the Coli Genetic Stock Center, Yale University. HT252 and D18 were from the ATCC. HT375 and D18 were defective in spermidine biosynthesis and produced only putrescine (28Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Hafner E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3671-3676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HT252, HT306, and HT414 were defective in both putrescine and spermidine biosynthesis (29Hafner E.W. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J.

Strain AB1111, obtained from Coli Genetic Stock Center, Yale University, has many identical genomic markers of all the polyamine mutants used in this work, so that AB1111 and W3110 were used as polyamine wild type controls. The plasmid pColE7-K317 containing the ColE7 operon has been described previously (17Lu F.M. Chak K.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Vectors pQE30 and pQE70 (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) were used to generate recombinant proteins with the His6 tag at the N or C termini, respectively. E. coli cultures were grown in LB or M9 medium. The M9 medium in this study was supplemented with 0.4 mm threonine, 0.4 mm proline, 0.2 mm histidine and methionine, 0.8 mm leucine, 1 mm serine, and 0.01% thiamine (32Neidhardt F.C. Bloch P.L.

The amplified DNA fragments of the tolA, tolB, btuB, or pal genes were cloned into the BamHI, KpnI, HindIII, or SalI sites of pQE30, thus fusing the His6 tag to the N terminus of each protein. Each recombinant plasmid was introduced into E. coli M15 containing pREP4, which encodes lacIq.

The antigen used to raise the anti-OmpF antibody was a synthetic peptide (KGNGENSYGGNGDMTY) corresponding to amino acid residues 47–62 of the OmpF protein. Other antigens used were the purified recombinant proteins from E. coli described above. Preparation of the anti-OmpC antibody has been described previously (33Yu S.L. Ko K.L. Chen C.S. Chang Y.C. Syu W.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5962-5968Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody against the σ70 was purchased from NeoClone (Madison, WI). The procedure for Western blotting was the same as described previously (25Liao C.C. Hsiao K.C. Liu Y.W. Leng P.H. Yuen H.S. Chak K.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The σ70 was used as an internal control because its synthesis was independent of polyamines (34Yoshida M. Kashiwagi K. Kawai G. Ishihama A. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16289-16295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies were used at a 1:50,000 dilution, and the secondary antibodies, anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase and anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), were diluted 5000- and 2500-fold, respectively. Images on x-ray films were scanned by a laser scanning densitometer (Amersham Biosciences), and band densities were quantified with the ImageQuant software (version 5.2; Amersham Biosciences). Assay of ColE7 Expression in Wild Type and Polyamine-defective Mutant Strains—Plasmid pColE7-K317 was introduced into AB1111, W3110, HT375, D18, HT252, HT306, and HT414 strains to investigate the effects of polyamines on ColE7 expression in various genetic backgrounds. The cells were grown overnight in M9 medium and diluted 100-fold into fresh M9 medium to grow overnight again for completely eliminating contaminations of exogenous polyamines. The overnight bacteria cultures were then diluted 100-fold into fresh M9 medium. When cell density reached A600 of ∼0.3, the culture was divided into two portions, and mitomycin C (MMC) 2The abbreviations used are: MMC, mitomycin C; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. was added directly to one of them to a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. ColE7 production in these cells with or without MMC induction was assessed by Western blotting at every 30-min interval for 2 h. For determining whether exogenous polyamines rescue ColE7 expression in polyamine-deficient mutants, cells were grown to A600 of 0.3 and then divided into several aliquots. Polyamines (putrescine or spermidine alone or mixture of putrescine and spermidine) were then added to each aliquot at concentrations ranging from 0 to 4 mm. MMC (0.5 μg/ml) was then added 30 min after addition of polyamines to induce ColE7 production. ColE7 expression was monitored by Western blotting as described above. It was noted that flasks used for cell cultures were pre-washed with diluted HCl to deplete any exogenous polyamine contamination. Purification of Native ColE7-Im7 Complex—One liter of LB medium was inoculated with a 10-ml overnight culture of W3110(pColE7-K317). ColE7-Im7 complex was isolated from the culture as described by Liao et al. (25Liao C.C. Hsiao K.C. Liu Y.W. Leng P.H. Yuen H.S. Chak K.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and the purity of the isolated ColE7-Im7 complex was determined by SDS-PAGE as described by Chak et al. (35Chak K.F. Hsieh S.Y. Liao C.C. Kan L. Proteins. 1998; 32: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Susceptibility of Cells to the ColE7-Im7 Complex—Wild type E. coli strains and polyamine-deficient mutants were grown in M9 medium to an A600 of 0.4–0.6, and then 1 × 109 cells were mixed with 5 ml of soft agar in M9 medium and overlaid on a M9 agar plate containing 10 ml of bottom agar as a lawn. After a brief evaporation of the moisture on the lawn, filter paper disks impregnated with 10, 5, 2.5, or 1.25 μg of native ColE7-Im7 were placed on the lawn. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h, and the size of the clear zone surrounding the disks was measured. To investigate effects of exogenous polyamines on the susceptibility of these cells to ColE7-Im7, both top and bottom agars were made to contain 0–4 mm putrescine, spermidine, or a mixture of putrescine and spermidine. Viable Counting of E. coli against ColE7-Im7—Wild type E. coli cells, W3110 and AB1111, and polyamine-defective mutants were grown in M9 medium to an A600 of 0.5. The cell cultures were then incubated with a final concentration of 3 ng/ml (sublethal dosage) of purified native ColE7-Im7 complex for 5 min. The cells were washed twice, and then 10-fold serial dilutions were made. The 10–5 to 10–7 dilutions were separately plated on LB agar plates. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h, and visible colonies were then counted. Determination of Polyamines by HPLC—E. coli cells, with or without MMC (0.05–0.25 μg/ml) or ColE7-Im7 (0.2 mg/ml) treatment, were harvested and assayed for their intracellular spermidine and putrescine concentrations. 5 × 108 cells were pelleted, resuspended in 250 μl of pure water, and then processed for HPLC analysis as described previously (36Kabra P.M. Lee H.K. Lubich W.P. Marton L.J. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 380: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 37Morgan D.M.L. Polyamine Protocols. Humana Press, Inc., New Jersey1998: 119-123Google Scholar). The internal standard 1,7-diaminoheptane, standard spermidine, and putrescine (Sigma) were treated and analyzed in an identical manner as controls. Samples were analyzed on an HPLC system equipped with sample controller (Waters 600E) and automated sample injector (S5200 sample injection, SFD, Germany) using a Luna C18 column (00G-4252-E0, 4.6 × 250 mm Luna, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with a 1-ml/min flow rate. Analysis of polyamines was monitored by a fluorescence detector (FP-2020 Plus, Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and emission wavelength of 515 nm. All data were stored and analyzed using the SISC ChemStation (Scientific Information Service Corporation, Taipei, Taiwan), which quantifies each compound by calculating the peak area of an HPLC. Identification and quantification of spermidine or putrescine in a sample were achieved by comparing the peak retention time and peak volume of the sample to those of standard spermidine or putrescine that was analyzed in an identical manner. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis and Identification of Periplasmic Proteins of E. coli Cells—W3110(pColE7-K317) cells were grown in LB medium to an A600 of 1 and then treated with or without 0.2 mg/ml of native ColE7-Im7 for 2 h. Periplasmic proteins of these cells were then isolated after osmotic shock (38Nossal N.G. Heppel L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3055-3062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for two-dimensional gel analysis. An immobilized pH gradient strip (13 cm, linear pH 4–7) was used in this study. Isoelectric focusing was performed on the IPGphor™ system (Amersham Biosciences) at 20 °C for a total of 93,890 Vhr including 30 V for 13 h, followed sequentially by 500 V for 1 h, 1000 V for 1 h, 4000 V for 2 h, 6000 V for 2 h, and 8000 V for 9 h. Preparative two-dimensional gels were stained overnight with 0.2% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 30% methanol and 5% acetic acid and then destained with 30% methanol. The analytical two-dimensional gels were stained with ammoniacal silver stain as described previously (39Pasquali C. Fialka I. Huber L.A. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2573-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Data acquisition for both preparative and analytical two-dimensional gels was achieved using the Image Master 2D Elite system (version 3.01, Lab San version 3.0, Amersham Biosciences). Spots representing differentially expressed proteins were excised manually and then transferred to an ultra-rigid skirted 96-well PCR plate (Thermofast® 96, Abgene, UK) for automatic in-gel digestion according to the procedures described in the MassPREP user's guide (Waters Associates, Milford, MA). The digested samples were subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Protein identification was performed as described previously (40Chen F.C. Shen L.F. Tsai M.C. Chak K.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 708-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Lack of ColE7 Production in Polyamine-deficient E. coli—Polyamines previously have been shown as an SOS-inducing mediator of E. coli (8Kim I.G. Oh T.J. Toxicol. Lett. 2000; 116: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9Oh T.J. Kim I.G. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1999; 15: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 10Oh T.J. Kim I.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 584-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and the ColE7 operon is known to be regulated by an SOS-responsive promoter (17Lu F.M. Chak K.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To study to what extent polyamines are involved in colicin production, we examined the expression of ColE7 in wild type E. coli strains (W3110 and AB1111) and polyamine-deficient E. coli strains (HT375, D18, HT252, HT306, and HT414). The plasmid pColE7-K317 was introduced into these strains, and ColE7 production in cells with or without MMC treatment was determined by Western blotting every 30 min for 2 h. ColE7 production was significantly induced in W3110(pColE7-K317) and AB1111(pColE7-K317) at 60 min after MMC treatment (Fig. 1A). The spermidine-defective strains D18(pColE7-K317) and HT375(pColE7-K317) produced less ColE7 under MMC treatment at a 2-h time point (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the strains HT252, HT306, and HT414 containing pColE7-K317 produced none or very little ColE7 even at the 2-h time point (Fig. 1B). To ensure polyamines are essential for the expression of ColE7, we set up an experiment to test if exogenous polyamine can rescue ColE7 expression in polyamine-defective mutants. The rescue experiment showed that exogenous polyamines effectively rescue the ColE7 expression in strains HT252, HT306, and HT414 (Fig. 1C), suggesting that polyamines play a crucial role in regulating the expression of the ColE7 operon. To find out whether the regulation of ColE7 production by polyamines is coupled with SOS response, we determined intracellular contents of putrescine and spermidine before and after MMC (0.05 or 0.25 μg/ml) treatment at various time points. We observed that putrescine and spermidine levels were induced significantly in W3110(pColE7-K317) 30 min after MMC treatment (Fig. 1D). Similar results were obtained from E. coli strains AB1111(pColE7-K317) and W3110 (data not shown). These data indicated that biosynthesis of spermidine and putrescine in E. coli cells is indeed coupled with the SOS response. Endogenous and Exogenous Polyamines Provide Limited Protection of E. coli against Colicin—It is already known that polyamines modulate the outer membrane permeability of E. coli cells (14Dela Vega A.L. Delcour A.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3715-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To investigate whether endogenous polyamines affect the susceptibility of E. coli to ColE7, wild type E. coli and E. coli defective in spermidine or in both putrescine and spermidine synthesis were assayed for their susceptibility to ColE7. Interestingly, larger clear zones surrounding the disks of HT252, HT306, and HT414 strains, defective in both spermidine and putrescine production, were observed in all four tested ColE7 concentrations compared with the controls (Fig. 2A). The strains D18 and HT37, defective in spermidine production, were also sensitive to ColE7 (Fig. 2A), and the viable counting assay indicated about 3-fold more sensitivity to ColE7 of stains HT375 and D18 compared with the controls (data not shown). These results might suggest that endogenous polyamine confers resistance on E. coli cells against ColE7. To study the fine-tuning of polyamines in regulating the susceptibility of E. coli to ColE7, the agar plates containing 0–4 mm concentrations of exogenous polyamines were made to examine the sensitivity of polyamine-defective mutants to ColE7. Addition of putrescine and spermidine or only spermidine up to 0.1 mm significantly reduces the clear zone size of mutants HT252, HT306, and HT414 compared with the mutants without exogenous polyamine addition (Fig. 2B). It was noted that addition of polyamines beyond the 0.1 mm dose does not further increase the protective effect of the mutants against colicin. Similar protective effect of the wild type strains (W3110 and AB1111) has also been observed, indicating that probably 0.1 mm of exogenous polyamines is sufficient for exerting the limited protection of the cells against colicin. Response of E. coli Proteins Involved in ColE7 Translocation to Polyamines—Proteins such as TolA, TolB, BtuB, OmpC, OmpF, and Pal are essential for the translocation of colicins across the E. coli cell membrane (41Lazzaroni J.C. Dubuisson J.F. Vianney A. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 42Kurisu G. Zakharov S.D. Zhalnina M.V. Bano S. Eroukova V.Y. Rokitskaya T.I. Antonenko Y.N. Wiener M.C. Cramer W.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 948-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Because polyamines (putrescine or spermidine) have been proved to render E. coli cells the limited resistance to ColE7 (Fig. 2), experiments were then designed to resolve whether polyamine alters the production of proteins involved in the translocation process of colicin. The SDS-PAGE analysis of W3110(pColE7-K317) treated with or without 4 mm spermidine was shown in Fig. 3A, and Western blotting against BtuB, TolA, OmpC, OmpF, TolB, Pal, and RpoD was shown in Fig. 3B. Results of Western blotting demonstrated that production of BtuB, TolA, Om"

III transcription apparatus of yeast comprises, in addition to the polymerase itself, three transcription initiation factors, TFIIIA, -B, and -C. The three-subunit TFIIIB is the core initiation factor required and sufficient for recruiting pol III to the promoter and accurately initiating transcription. The large six-subunit TFIIIC places TFIIIB on DNA upstream of the transcriptional start site and protects the generally very small pol III transcription units from encroachment by repressive chromatin (1Burnol A.F.

Biol. 2004; 24: 3596-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). TFIIIA is the 5 S rRNA gene-specific factor that places TFIIIC on the transcription unit-internal promoter of these genes (reviewed in Refs. 3Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 4Schramm L. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2593-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 5White R.J. RNA Polymerase III Transcription, 3rd Ed. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX2002Google Scholar). The work that is presented here deals with the structure of TFIIIB, which is composed of three subunits: the TATA-binding protein (TBP), Brf1, and Bdp1. TBP and Brf1 bind tightly and co-purify, whereas Bdp1 dissociates during later steps of conventional column chromatography. (The two separated fractions of TFIIIB have been designated B′ and B″, and B double prime has been adopted as the eponym of the Bdp1 subunit.) The 596-amino acid Brf1 is a fusion protein, with an N-terminal half that is related to the pol II transcription initiation factor TFIIB and a pol III-specific C-terminal half. A conserved segment of the C-terminal half (homology domain II; amino acids 439–515) constitutes the Brf1 high affinity binding site for the evolutionarily highly conserved core of TBP (comprising all but the N-terminal 60 amino acids of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein); the N-terminal half of Brf1 engages TBP through a separate lower affinity interaction. The N- and C-terminal halves of Brf1 also provide separate Bdp1-docking sites, with the C-proximal homology domain II contributing the higher Bdp1 affinity. TBP makes only a minor direct contribution to bringing Bdp1 into TFIIIB. Thus, the pol III-specific half of Brf1 appears to contribute the interactions that principally hold TFIIIB together. Indeed, when TFIIIB-promoter complexes are assembled in vitro with the separated halves of Brf1, the DNA complex formed with the Brf1 C-terminal half is stable but transcriptionally almost inactive, whereas the promoter complex formed with the Brf1 N-terminal half is quite unstable but transcriptionally highly active, yielding nearly wild-type levels of transcription (6Kassavetis G.A. Kumar A. Ramirez E. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5587-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The determination of the structure of a ternary complex formed by a DNA fragment with a strong TATA box, TBP core (amino acids 61–240), and a large C-terminal fragment of Brf1 showed the latter making essentially continuous contact along both lobes of the convex surface of TBP and also interacting with a side and stirrup of the N-terminal TBP lobe (7Juo Z.S. Kassavetis G.A. Wang J. Geiduschek E.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 2003; 422: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The structure also suggested that it might be possible to separate the N- and C-terminal domains of Brf1 and reconnect them through TBP. Indeed, a triple fusion protein that reconfigures TFIIIB topology by placing the TBP core between the N- and C-proximal domains of Brf1 fully replaces both Brf1 and TBP for TFIIIC-dependent and -independent transcription in vitro. Together with Bdp1, this Brf1-TBP fusion protein forms an extremely stable TFIIIB·DNA complex whose footprint is indistinguishable from that of the wild type TFIIIB·DNA complex. The Brf1-TBP triple fusion is also able to replace Brf1 in vivo (8Kassavetis G.A. Soragni E. Driscoll R. Geiduschek E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15406-15411Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although Bdp1 is an essential yeast protein, removal of large segments from the N- and C-ends is compatible with some level of viability. The strongest conservation of sequence is confined to a single SANT domain located in the C-terminal one-third of Bdp1 (the three-helix SANT domains are deployed as DNA interaction as well as protein interaction modules), and weak conservation extends to either side of this element, over most of the C-terminal half. Not only is the participation of Bdp1 essential for recruitment of pol III to the promoter (presented as double-stranded DNA) by TFIIIB, but it also plays an essential role in initiating promoter opening (9Kassavetis G.A. Letts G.A. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2823-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this work, we have exploited the structure of the Brf1(439–596)·TBP core(61–240)·DNA ternary complex for a systematic site-directed mutagenesis that identifies individual residues constituting the primary Bdp1-binding site of Brf1. The result that emerges from the analysis is that Brf1 homology segment II serves as a two-sided adhesive for fixing Bdp1 to TBP. A large collection of C-terminal, N-terminal, and internal deletion variants of Bdp1 has been used to show that its SANT domain (amino acids 415–472) is the Bdp1 segment that interacts with the C-terminal domain of Brf1.

The phosphor image intensity for the DNA adduct of each mutant TBPc-Brf1c variant (Ei) was initially normalized to that of reference type TBPc-Brf1c (Eo) in the individual experiment (ri = Ei/Eo). The following method was employed in order to remove the compounding effect of variation in Eo, the cross-linking signal for reference type TBPc-Brf1c: 1) the mean values of the normalized cross-linking efficiency for the reference type protein (Ēo) and each variant (Ēi) was determined from all experiments; 2) the ratio of each TBPc-Brf1c variant and reference type value in individual experiments to the cross-experiment mean (Po = Eo/Ēo; Pi = Ei/Ēi) was determined; and 3) the average, P̄, of all of the Pi and Po values for an individual experiment, taken together, was then used to renormalize ri for each individual experiment (i.e. Ri = ri/P̄), and averages of Ri (i.e. R̄i) were taken. The same procedure was used to renormalize Bdp1/TBPc-Brf1c cross-linking ratios between experiments for each variant protein (Q̄i). Finally, the Bdp1 cross-linking efficiency of each variant protein was calculated as the product of its renormalized Bdp1/TBPc-Brfc cross-linking ratio (Q̄i) multiplied by its mean renormalized TBPc-Brf1c cross-linking efficiency (R̄i). Nomenclature—Protein fusions as well as photochemically generated protein-DNA cross-links are designated by a hyphen (e.g. TBPc-Brf1c); noncovalent association between proteins or between proteins and DNA is designated by a dot (e.g. the TBP·Brf1·DNA complex). The recently determined structure of the ternary complex formed by Brf1c, TBPc, and DNA, in which Brf1 residues 437–506 were resolved (7Juo Z.S. Kassavetis G.A. Wang J. Geiduschek E.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 2003; 422: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), provides a framework for using site-directed mutagenesis to identify Brf1c residues that are important for Bdp1 interaction. We anticipated one possible complication in interpreting the outcome of this systematic amino acid substitution screen; the Brf1c amino acid 439–506 segment interface with TBP is notably extensive and spread out (Fig. 1A), and the stability of at least some secondary structure features of Brf1c (e.g. helix H22) may depend on interaction with TBP (7Juo Z.S. Kassavetis G.A. Wang J. Geiduschek E.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 2003; 422: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, diminished Bdp1 binding by Brf1 mutants may not be solely due to the loss of direct Brf1·Bdp1 contacts but can also arise because of effects on the proper folding and/or alignment of Brf1c along its extensive TBP interface. To circumvent this possible complication, we have tethered Brf1c to TBPc with the flexible 12-amino acid connector (GS)6, taking advantage of the fact that the C terminus of TBPc (M240; space filled in cyan in Fig. 1A) lies within ∼20 Å of the N terminus of Brf1c (P439; space filled in green in Fig. 1A). TBPc-Brf1c, with a hypothetical orientation of the connector (in orange) is shown in Fig. 1A. The high local concentration afforded by this tether and its flexibility should diminish the sensitivity of Brf1c·Bdp1 binding to adventitious effects of mutations on Brf1c·TBPc binding. A similar approach was used to rescue the TFIIA binding defect of a TBP mutant protein in yeast (18Stargell L.A. Struhl K. Science. 1995; 269: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The ability of TBPc-Brf1c to assemble Bdp1 onto DNA and to function for transcription has been documented (8Kassavetis G.A. Soragni E. Driscoll R. Geiduschek E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15406-15411Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and is further analyzed below. A remarkable 29 of the 67 amino acid residues of Brf1c that are resolved in the structure of the ternary Brf1·TBP·DNA complex have side chains that hydrogen-bond to or form van der Waals contacts with residues of TBP (sequence in Fig. 1C, lowercase residues) (7Juo Z.S. Kassavetis G.A. Wang J. Geiduschek E.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 2003; 422: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)). Twenty-six of the 38 amino acids whose side chains are not in contact with TBP were substituted, along with Asp458 and Glu484, which make limited van der Waals contacts with TBP, and Asp460 and Asn471, which form hydrogen bonds with TBP in at least two of the four crystallographically independent complexes (mutated residues are highlighted in Fig. 1C). The large aliphatic side chains of Leu and Ile (yellow in Fig. 1B) and large polar side chain of Asn and His (dark green) were replaced with the small aliphatic side chain of Ala; small polar residues Thr and Ser (orange) were replaced with Leu; acidic residues Asp and Glu (red) were replaced with Lys; basic residues Lys and Arg (blue) were replaced with Glu (Asp for Arg502). The effect of mutations on the Bdp1·Brf1 interaction was examined by photochemical protein-DNA cross-linking. The same method has been used previously to identify radical sequence substitutions in TBP that interfere with binding to the TFIIB-related N-terminal half of Brf1 in a DNA complex (19Schröder O. Bryant G.O. Geiduschek E.P. Berk A.J. Kassavetis G.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5115-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We first examined the potential contribution to Bdp1 binding of the amino acid 507–596 segment of Brf1c, which is not resolved in the ternary complex structure. The 51 C-terminal Brf1 residues (546–596) have been shown not to provide a major Bdp1-binding site (6Kassavetis G.A. Kumar A. Ramirez E. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5587-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Two additional C-terminal truncations of Brf1c were generated in the TBPc-Brf1c fusion protein, one ending at amino acid 511 and the other at amino acid 497, within the Brf1 helix H25 (Fig. 1C). DNA complexes were formed with Bdp1 and TBPc-Brf1c (or its derivatives) and a mixture of two probes covering the SNR6 (U6 snRNA) gene promoter region (bp -56 to bp +1, the start site of transcription), one with the photoactive thymidylate analogue 5-[N′-(p-azidobenzoyl)-3-aminoallyl]dUMP (20Bartholomew B. Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2197-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) at bp -39 and -38 and with [α-32P]-dCMP at bp -37 on the nontranscribed strand to monitor the presence of Bdp1, and the other, with [N′-(p-azidobenzoyl)-3-aminoallyl]dUMP at bp -13 and -12 and [α-32P]dCMP at bp -11 to monitor the presence of TBPc-Brf1c. Fig. 2A shows a photochemical cross-linking experiment with Bdp1 and “full-length” TBPc-Brf1c (i.e. extending to the C terminus of Brf1) or truncated at Brf1 residue 511 or 497. The concentration of TBPc-Brf1c (20 nm) was saturating for DNA cross-linking, but Bdp1 (20 nm) was limiting for assembly onto the TBPc-Brf1c·DNA complex. Truncation of TBPc-Brf1c to amino acid 511 or 497 did not appreciably impair the assembly of Bdp1 (A; quantified below each lane), even at a 2-fold lower Bdp1 concentration (data not shown). Truncation to amino acid 511 or 497 decreased the DNA cross-linking efficiency of TBPc-Brf1c (lanes 3 and 4) but not to the extent observed in the absence of TBPc-Brf1c tethering (data not shown). As noted previously (6Kassavetis G.A. Kumar A. Ramirez E. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5587-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Roberts S. Miller S.J. Lane W.S. Lee S. Hahn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14903-14909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), TBPc alone was capable of assembling Bdp1 to a small extent (lane 1). Brf1(1–509) has been shown to be severely defective in TFIIIC-dependent and -independent transcription and, to a lesser extent, in TFIIIB·TFIIIC·DNA complex formation (22Huet J. Conesa C. Carles C. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18341-18349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast, Brf1(1–545) displayed at most a 2-fold defect in TFIIIC-independent transcription of SNR6 as supercoiled DNA (6Kassavetis G.A. Kumar A. Ramirez E. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5587-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Since TFIIIC-independent transcription of supercoiled templates by pol III is substantially independent of the C-terminal half of Brf1 (6Kassavetis G.A. Kumar A. Ramirez E. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5587-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of C-terminal truncations of TBPc-Brf1c on transcription of an SNR6-derived template presented as linear DNA. This transcription requires both the N-terminal (TFIIB-related) half of Brf1 and TBPc-Brf1c (8Kassavetis G.A. Soragni E. Driscoll R. Geiduschek E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15406-15411Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The ability of TBPc-Brf1c truncated to Brf1 residue 564, 544, 511, or 497 to support TFIIIC-independent transcription is shown in Fig. 2B (the quantification of two experiments is shown below each lane). Truncation of Brf1c to residue 564 or 544, removing Brf1 homology domain III (amino acids 570–595) (23Khoo B. Brophy B. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2879-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) diminished transcription 4–5-fold (lanes 1–3; note that TBP binds to the SNR6 TATA box in either orientation, yielding divergent transcripts r-U6 and l-U6). Cross-linking experiments similar to Fig. 2A verified that TBPc-Brf1(439–544) was competent to assemble Bdp1 (data not shown) and not inadvertently inactive. Further truncation of TBPc-Brf1c to residue 511 or 497 reduced transcription to barely detectable levels (lanes 4 and 5). Thus, the 100 C-terminal amino acids of Brf1 (which include homology region III) do not contribute significantly to Bdp1 assembly, but removing them progressively impairs transcription of linear DNA. We next examined the effect of amino acid substitution between Brf1 residues 441 and 508 on Bdp1 assembly using a set of 10 TBPc-Brf1c variants containing locally clustered mutations. As with the C-terminal TBPc-Brf1c truncations in Fig. 2, the ability of these TBPc-Brf1c cluster mutant proteins to assemble Bdp1 onto DNA was assessed by cross-linking with limiting concentrations of Bdp1 (5 and 10 nm) and saturating concentrations of each mutant TBPc-Brf1c variant (≥20 nm) for both TBPc-Brf1c-DNA and Bdp1-DNA cross-linking. A sample cross-linking analysis is shown in Fig. 3A. Two TBPc-Brf1c cluster mutant proteins (K481E/L482A/R485E (lane 8) and L482A/I486A/L490A (lane 9)) were seen to be clearly defective in assembling Bdp1 when compared with unmutated (“reference”) TBPc-Brf1c (lane 2). The effects of these clustered mut"
https://openalex.org/W2081372023,"Specification and differentiation of the megakaryocyte and erythroid lineages from a common bipotential progenitor provides a well studied model to dissect binary cell fate decisions. To understand how the distinct megakaryocyte- and erythroid-specific gene programs arise, we have examined the transcriptional regulation of the megakaryocyte erythroid transcription factor GATA1. Hemopoietic-specific mouse (m)GATA1 expression requires the mGata1 enhancer mHS-3.5. Within mHS-3.5, the 3' 179 bp of mHS-3.5 are required for megakaryocyte but not red cell expression. Here, we show mHS-3.5 binds key hemopoietic transcription factors in vivo and is required to maintain histone acetylation at the mGata1 locus in primary megakaryocytes. Analysis of GATA1-LacZ reporter gene expression in transgenic mice shows that a 25-bp element within the 3'-179 bp in mHS-3.5 is critical for megakaryocyte expression. In vitro three DNA binding activities A, B, and C bind to the core of the 25-bp element, and these binding sites are conserved through evolution. Activity A is the zinc finger transcription factor ZBP89 that also binds to other cis elements in the mGata1 locus. Activity B is of particular interest as it is present in primary megakaryocytes but not red cells. Furthermore, mutation analysis in transgenic mice reveals activity B is required for megakaryocyte-specific enhancer function. Bioinformatic analysis shows sequence corresponding to the binding site for activity B is a previously unrecognized motif, present in the cis elements of the Fli1 gene, another important megakaryocyte-specific transcription factor. In summary, we have identified a motif and a DNA binding activity likely to be important in directing a megakaryocyte gene expression program that is distinct from that in red cells."
