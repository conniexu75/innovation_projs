https://openalex.org/W2003623977,"Human circadian rhythms were once thought to be insensitive to light, with synchronization to the 24-hour day accomplished either through social contacts or the sleep-wake schedule. Yet the demonstration of an intensity-dependent neuroendocrine response to bright light has led to renewed consideration of light as a possible synchronizer of the human circadian pacemaker. In a laboratory study, the output of the circadian pacemaker of an elderly woman was monitored before and after exposure to 4 hours of bright light for seven consecutive evenings, and before and after a control study in ordinary room light while her sleep-wake schedule and social contacts remained unchanged. The exposure to bright light in the evening induced a 6-hour delay shift of her circadian pacemaker, as indicated by recordings of body temperature and cortisol secretion. The unexpected magnitude, rapidity, and stability of the shift challenge existing concepts regarding circadian phase-resetting capacity in man and suggest that exposure to bright light can indeed reset the human circadian pacemaker, which controls daily variations in physiologic, behavioral, and cognitive function."
https://openalex.org/W2069294982,"Adhesive interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix occur at several stages of metastasis. Such interactions might be inhibited by synthetic peptide probes derived from the cell-binding regions of matrix molecules. Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (GRGDS) is a pentapeptide sequence that appears to be critical for cell interaction with fibronectin. Coinjection of GRGDS with B16-F10 murine melanoma cells dramatically inhibited the formation of lung colonies in C57BL/6 mice. Two closely related control peptides, in which specific amino acids within the GRGDS sequence were transposed or substituted, displayed little or no activity. Inhibition by GRGDS was dose-dependent, noncytotoxic, and did not result from an impairment of cellular tumorigenicity. GRGDS may function by inhibiting tumor cell retention in the lung since radiolabeled B16-F10 tumor cells injected with the peptide were lost at a substantially greater rate than control cells."

https://openalex.org/W2040020188,"Plasmacytoma (PCT) cell lines dependent for proliferation and survival on a factor elaborated by the murine macrophage cell line, P388D1, were established in vitro. Adherent peritoneal cells induced by pristane produced 50-fold greater amounts of this activity in vitro than did resident cells. The molecules responsible for plasmacytoma growth were distinct from a number of characterized factors including interleukin-1, -2, and -3, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, B-cell stimulatory factor-1, B-cell growth factor II, epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, and gamma- and beta-interferon, none of which were able to support the growth of the factor-dependent PCT cell lines. These results suggest that PCT growth factor may be a novel factor that has not been previously characterized and, further, that its production is associated with the pristane-induced, chronic peritoneal inflammatory response that precedes plasmacytoma formation."
https://openalex.org/W1995172710,"The role of the transit peptide in the routing of imported proteins inside the chloroplast was investigated with chimeric proteins in which the transit peptides for the nuclear-encoded ferredoxin and plastocyanin precursors were exchanged. Import and localization experiments with a reconstituted chloroplast system show that the ferredoxin transit peptide directs mature plastocyanin away from its correct location, the thylakoid lumen, to the stroma. With the plastocyanin transit peptide-mature ferredoxin chimera, a processing intermediate is arrested on its way to the lumen. We propose a two domain hypothesis for the plastocyanin transit peptide: the first domain functions in the chloroplast import process, whereas the second is responsible for transport across the thylakoid membrane. Thus, the transit peptide not only targets proteins to the chloroplast, but also is a major determinant in their subsequent localization within the organelle."

https://openalex.org/W1977922751,"Lymphocytes are essential mediators of normal tissue inflammatory reactions and of pathologic tissue damage in, for example, rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. In a study of the mechanisms controlling lymphocyte entry into sites of inflammation from the blood, the function and specificity of lymphocyte-endothelial interactions were examined in inflamed joint tissue (synovium) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Synovial high endothelial venules (HEV) supported the binding of normal peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro. The characteristics of this binding, which were similar to those of lymphocyte-HEV interactions controlling lymphocyte migration into organized lymphoid tissues, included a requirement for calcium ions, a dependence on metabolic activity, and a preferential adherence of circulating lymphocytes as opposed to immature thymocytes. However, the binding of lymphocytes to synovial HEV was not inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to lymphocyte receptors for lymph node HEV, and synovial HEV failed to bind either lymph node HEV-specific or mucosal HEV-specific B lymphoblastoid cells. The results suggest that a lymphocyte-endothelial cell recognition system that is distinct from such systems in organized lymphoid tissues directs the extravasation of normal lymphocytes as well as pathologically important effector cells into inflamed synovium."

https://openalex.org/W2069008694,"The Ti plasmid vir loci of Agrobacterium tumefaciens are transcriptionally activated in response to signal molecules produced by plant cells to initiate the T-DNA transfer process. We show that the pTiA6 vir loci are organized as a single regulon whose induction by plants is controlled by virA and virG. Mutations in virA result in attenuated induction. This locus is constitutively transcribed and noninducible. Mutations in virG eliminate vir induction. This locus is constitutively transcribed, plant-inducible, and self-regulated in a complex fashion, and it produces two distinct and differentially regulated transcripts. virA is proposed to encode a transport protein for the plant signal molecule, and virG a positive regulatory protein that together with the plant molecule activates vir expression."
https://openalex.org/W2041035653,The distribution of potassium conductance over the surface of freshly dissociated salamander astrocytes was determined by monitoring cell depolarizations evoked by focal increases in the extracellular potassium concentration. The specific potassium conductance of the endfoot processes of these cells was approximately tenfold higher than the conductance of other cell regions. This dramatically nonuniform conductance distribution may play an important role in the regulation of extracellular potassium levels by glia in the brain.
https://openalex.org/W2053141298,"The mechanism by which sex steroids rapidly modulate the excitability of neurons was investigated by intracellular recording of neurons in rat medial amygdala brain slices. Brief hyperpolarization and increased potassium conductance were produced by 17β-estradiol. This effect persisted after elimination of synaptic input and after suppression of protein synthesis. Thus, 17β-estradiol directly changes the ionic conductance of the postsynaptic membrane of medial amygdala neurons. In addition, a greater proportion of the neurons from females than from males responded to 17β-estradiol."
https://openalex.org/W2054111304,"Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy can now be used to investigate the biochemical energetics of human tissues and organs noninvasively. The method already has increased our understanding of some muscle diseases, has provided information from muscle metabolism about whole-body functions, control, and hormonal status, has helped in the elucidation of hitherto unrecognized causes of disease, and yielded new ideas about the control of bioenergetics in vivo. Studies on the biochemistry of human brain, liver, heart, and kidney are just beginning. Further investigations of well-selected patients are likely to bring biochemistry and clinical practice closer together."
https://openalex.org/W1979692126,"Interspecific heterokaryons were formed by fusing adult mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells and human embryonic/fetal erythroid (K562) cells with each other, or with a variety of mouse and human nonerythroid cell types. Analysis of total cellular RNA isolated 24 hr after fusion revealed that normally inactive globin genes can be activated in these “transient” heterokaryons, in which the nuclei do not fuse. In general, the types of globin genes expressed in the donor erythroid cell are activated in the nucleus of the recipient cell. Therefore, erythroid cells contain trans-acting regulatory factors that are capable of activating the expression of globin genes in a stage- and tissuespecific manner. These observations also indicate that globin genes are not irreversibly repressed in differentiated cells and that their expression can be rapidly reprogrammed in the presence of the appropriate regulatory factors."
https://openalex.org/W1973856704,"Many regional differences in Caenorhabditis elegans body pattern are generated after hatching. Here I describe a gene, mab-5, that is required for the postembryonic development of nearly all ectodermal and mesodermal features that normally characterize a posterior body region. In addition, this gene is necessary for most cell migrations toward the posterior, but not for cell migrations toward the anterior. mab-5+ activity is cell-autonomous. In animals carrying a mutation in the gene lin-22, increases or decreases in mab-5+ gene dosage produce corresponding increases or decreases in the size of the region in which cells adopt posterior-specific fates. The model that best explains the data is that during postembryonic development, posterior-specific patterns of cell differentiation and cell migration are initiated by graded positional information, and that a common step in the different cellular responses to this information is mediated by mab-5 activity."
https://openalex.org/W1524957948,"Factor IX has been expressed to high levels within a recombinant host cell and the biologically active fraction subsequently purified to homogeneity for characterization. The coding sequence for Factor IX was inserted into a mammalian cell expression vector and transfected into dihydrofolate reductase-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells. The integrated DNA was amplified to a high copy number by selection for increasingly higher expression levels of the marker gene, dihydrofolate reductase, contained within a co-transfected plasmid. Cloned cell lines secreting over 100 micrograms/ml Factor IX antigen and up to 1.5 microgram/ml native Factor IX antigen have been obtained. Expression of biologically active Factor IX was dependent on the presence of vitamin K in the culture media. The gamma-carboxylated Factor IX was isolated from cell culture fluid by immunoaffinity chromatography using antibodies conformation-specific for the metal-stabilized conformer of Factor IX. This conformation is dependent upon metal ions and gamma-carboxyglutamic acid. Purified recombinant Factor IX migrated as a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an electrophoretic mobility equivalent to plasma-derived Factor IX. The purified recombinant Factor IX demonstrated Factor IX coagulant activity, measured in Factor IX-deficient plasma, of 35-75 units/mg. Amino acid analysis of the alkaline hydrolysate of recombinant Factor IX demonstrated an average of 6-7 mol of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid per mol of Factor IX. NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the first 17 residues revealed equivalent amino acid sequences for both purified recombinant and plasma-derived Factor IX. The results represent the first purification and characterization of a biologically active, gamma-carboxylated vitamin K-dependent protein expressed in a recombinant DNA system."
https://openalex.org/W1998317626,"Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a mitogenic polypeptide, is usually considered the sole effector by means of which growth hormone increases tissue mass. However, growth hormone, but not IGF-1, directly promotes the differentiation of cultured preadipocytes to adipocytes. Adipocytes newly differentiated from precursor cells in response to growth hormone were shown to be much more sensitive to the mitogenic effect of IGF-1 than the precursor cells. The result of IGF-1 action is therefore a selective multiplication of young differentiated cells (cloned expansion). This supports the concept of a dual effector system in which the preferred target cells of IGF-1 action are created by the direct action of growth hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1974339713,"In R. meliloti we have identified four nodulation genes determining plant host-range specificity and have designated them hsnABC and D. The genes code for 9.7, 41.7, 26.7, and 28.6 kd proteins, respectively, and are organized into two transcriptional units. Mutations in these genes affect nodulation of their natural plant hosts Medicago sativa and Melilotus albus to different extents and hsnD mutants have an altered host-range. These Nod- mutations are not complementable by nodulation genes of other Rhizobium species such as R. leguminosarum. The hsn genes determine plant-specific infection through root hairs: hsnD is required for host-specific root hair curling and nodule initiation while the hsnABC genes control infection thread growth from the root hairs."
https://openalex.org/W1968183770,"Neurons that accumulate the transmitter serotonin have been identified in the living retina by being labeled with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-HT), an autofluorescent serotonin analog. Iontophoretic injection of Lucifer yellow into the labeled cells under microscopic control revealed that the serotonin-accumulating neurons in rabbit retina constitute two morphological types of amacrine cells, termed S1 and S2, whose distal dendrites are stratified at the inner margin of the inner plexiform layer. The dendritic overlap of the S1 type is extraordinarily large: each point on the retina is covered by the fields of 550 to 900 S1 amacrines, and 6 to 8 meters of their dendrites are packed into each square millimeter of retina. Such a pervasive neuropil may provide an effective substrate for diffuse transmitter release, as proposed for serotonergic fibers elsewhere in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2026737273,"The H-2 histocompatibility complex of the mouse is a multigene family, some members of which are essential for the immune response to foreign antigens. The structure and organization of these genes have been established by molecular cloning, and their regulation and function is being defined by expression of the cloned genes."
https://openalex.org/W1513625834,"Bovine brain-derived growth factor (BDGF) is very similar to endothelial cell growth factor and brain-derived acidic fibroblast growth factor in terms of pI (5.7) and molecular weight (approximately 17,000). BDGF has a wide spectrum of cell specificity, including bovine aorta endothelial cells and Swiss mouse 3T3 cells. BDGF stimulates the phosphorylation of a 135-kDa protein in plasma membranes of 3T3 cells. The optimal concentration for stimulation of phosphorylation is close to the Kd of 125I-BDGF binding to receptor, suggesting that the BDGF-stimulated 32P-labeled 135-kDa protein may be the BDGF receptor. The alkaline stability of this 32P-labeled 135-kDa phosphoprotein and phosphoamino acid analysis of the acid hydrolysates indicate that the phosphorylation occurs at tyrosine residues. The molecular size of BDGF receptor is estimated as approximately 135 kDa by cross-linking 125I-BDGF to its receptor in 3T3 cells, using a bifunctional reagent, ethylene glycolbis(succinimidylsuccinate). Both BDGF-stimulated phosphorylation and 125I-BDGF binding to receptor can be inhibited by protamine. These results suggest that the BDGF receptor is a 135-kDa protein which is associated with a protein tyrosine kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1496546960,"We have recently isolated, without using any inhibitors, a mutant of Chinese hamster ovary cell line which greatly overproduces ornithine decarboxylase in serum-free culture. Addition of polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, or spermine, 10 microM) or ornithine (1 mM), the precursor of polyamines, to the culture medium of these cells caused a rapid and extensive decay of ornithine decarboxylase activity. At the same time the activity of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase showed a less pronounced decrease. Notably, the polyamine concentrations used were optimal for growth of the cells and caused no perturbation of general protein synthesis. Spermidine and spermine appeared to be the principal regulatory amines for both enzymes, but also putrescine, if accumulated at high levels in the cells, was capable of suppressing ornithine decarboxylase activity. The amount of ornithine decarboxylase protein (as measured by radioimmunoassay) declined somewhat more slowly than the enzyme activity, but no more than 10% of the loss of activity could be ascribed to post-translational modifications or inhibitor interaction. Some evidence for inactivation through ornithine decarboxylase-antizyme complex formation was obtained. Gel electrophoretic determinations of the [35S]methionine-labeled ornithine decarboxylase revealed a rapid reduction in the synthesis and acceleration in the degradation of the enzyme after polyamine additions. No decrease in the amounts of the two ornithine decarboxylase-mRNA species, hybridizable to a specific cDNA, was detected, suggesting that polyamines depressed ornithine decarboxylase synthesis by selectively inhibiting translation of the message."
https://openalex.org/W1589479912,"The geometry of hydrogen donor molecules bound to horseradish peroxidase was investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Between resorcinol and 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol which showed different optical difference spectra, little difference was observed in the orientation of the molecules bound to horseradish peroxidase: the minimal distances between the enzyme iron and the protons of the phenol rings are in the range of 8.4-11.0 A. This situation was not greatly different for the third compound studied in this paper, benzhydroxamic acid, providing evidence against the view that its side chain coordinates to the heme iron. Furthermore, it was found that transferred nuclear Overhauser effect for the signals of these compounds was observable only when the heme peripheral 8-methyl proton signal was irradiated. These results, together with a hypothetical model of the enzyme structure obtained by computer-aided simulation procedures, suggest that the binding of these donor molecules and competitive inhibitors occur in the vicinity of the heme peripheral 8-methyl group, with hydrophobic interactions probably with Tyr-185 and with hydrogen bond with adjacent amino acid residues such as Arg-183."
https://openalex.org/W2053119882,"The relative stability of amplified DNA in drug-resistant Leishmania major was previously reported to be dependent on location, that is, unstable amplified DNA was extrachromosomal and stable amplified DNA was chromosomal. Leishmanial chromosomes have now been directly examined by means of orthogonal-field-alternation gel electrophoresis (OFAGE). The amplified DNA's in three resistant cell lines displayed unusual migration and were clearly extrachromosomal, regardless of whether the amplified DNA's were stable or unstable. Thus, contrary to conclusions from earlier studies of drug resistance in cultured animal cells, stable amplified DNA in Leishmania can be extrachromosomal. In addition, these amplified DNA's were shown to be circular on the basis of their resistance to exonuclease III digestion and their behavior on OFAGE. Their mobility was also greatly changed after treatment with topoisomerase II, suggesting that the amplified DNA's were either supercoiled or concatenated circles."
https://openalex.org/W2067209343,"The MH-3 gene, which contains a homeo box that is expressed specifically in the adult testis, was identified and mapped to mouse chromosome 6. By means of in situ hybridization with adult testis sections and Northern blot hybridization with testis RNA from prepuberal mice and from Sl/Sld mutant mice, it was demonstrated that this gene is expressed in male germ cells during late meiosis. In the embryo, MH-3 transcripts were present at day 11.5 post coitum, a stage in mouse development when gonadal differentiation has not yet occurred. The MH-3 gene may have functions in spermatogenesis and embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2158150851,"The specific inhibitor of glutathione biosynthesis, L-buthionine sulfoximine (L-BSO), although relatively nontoxic in adult mice, induces severe glutathione depletion and age-specific pathological changes when repeatedly administered to male suckling mice. Dense cataracts developed when mice aged 9 to 12 days were given a series of injections of L-BSO, despite excellent survival and the absence of other significant long-term effects. By contrast, similar treatment of mice aged 14 to 17 days, although slightly less effective in reducing glutathione levels, resulted frequently in death, hind-leg paralysis, or impaired spermatogenesis, but did not produce cataracts. Administration of L-BSO to preweanling mice provides a novel model system for the induction of cataracts by depletion of lens glutathione and may enable the study of critical functions of glutathione in the lens and other growing tissues during early postnatal development."
https://openalex.org/W2146996748,"Antibodies to phospholipids may have important physiological and biological functions. Lupus anticoagulants represent a subclass of anti-phospholipid antibodies which are characterized by their ability to prolong the clotting time in in vitro coagulation assays measuring partial thromboplastin time (PTT) (Thiagarajan, P., Shapiro, S. S., and DeMarco, L. (1980) J. Clin. Invest. 66, 397-405). In the present study, we produced hybridomas by fusing lymphocytes from 13 systemic lupus erythematosus patients with the GM 4672 lymphoblastoid line. Of the resulting 67 hybridoma autoantibodies, 14 (21%) were found to prolong a modified PTT assay, and 11 of these antibodies were analyzed further. Competition experiments, using a modified PTT assay, demonstrated that hexagonal phase phospholipids, including natural and synthetic forms of phosphatidylethanolamine, were able to neutralize the lupus anticoagulant activity of all 11 hybridoma antibodies. In contrast, lamellar phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine and synthetic lamellar forms of phosphatidylethanolamine, had no effect on the anticoagulant activity. Thus, these antibodies are capable of recognizing phospholipids on purely structural criteria. The demonstration that anti-phospholipid antibodies are able to distinguish between different structural arrangements of phospholipid may have important implications regarding the immunoregulation of autoimmunity."

The primary effect in response to thyrotropin action in thyroid cells is the induction of the c-fos oncogene, followed by c-myc expression. This suggests that thyrotropin acts as a competence growth factor."
https://openalex.org/W1993309007,"When a male Sierra dome spider (Linyphia litigiosa) encounters a virgin female that has been sexually mature for 7 to 10 days, he rapidly packs the silk of her web into a tight mass. This behavior hinders evaporation of a male-attractant chemical that such highly receptive females apply to their webs. The male thereby reduces the likelihood that his mating partner will attract rival males."

https://openalex.org/W1539508304,"Anionic phospholipids induce a marked conformational change in a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 1-27 of pre-ornithine carbamyltransferase. The peptide designated, pO-(1-27)-peptide amide, becomes more alpha-helical in the presence of cardiolipin or dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol but not in the presence of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine. The greater helix-promoting action of anionic versus zwitterionic lipids is predicted by helix-coil transition theory. This statistical mechanical theory also predicts that a shorter peptide, N-acetyl-pO-(16-27)-peptide amide, has less helix-forming tendency, even in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, despite the fact that it has a comparable number of positive charges. The N-acetyl-pO-(16-27)-peptide amide has no helical structure in buffer with or without dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol but it has a small (5%) helical content in methanol. Thus, the ability of anionic lipids to promote helix formation requires more than the presence of cationic groups on the peptide. The angular dependence of the hydrophobic moment of the putative helical segment of pO-(1-27)-peptide amide demonstrates that any helical structure which is formed would have some amphiphilic character. The pO-(1-27)-peptide amide disrupts large lipid aggregates to form discoid micelles about 30 to 50 nm in diameter. The ability to lyse membranes into disc-shaped micelles is characteristic of peptides containing an amphiphathic helix. In the case of the mitochondrial signal peptide, this membrane-lytic behavior may contribute to the translocation of the protein into the organelle."
https://openalex.org/W1977424125,"Addition of mouse interferon-alpha/beta (IFN) to confluent, quiescent BALB/c 3T3 (clone A31) mouse fibroblasts resulted in a block or delay in serum-induced activation of the cell cycle. It was necessary to add IFN within 6 hours after serum stimulation to inhibit nuclear labeling with [3H]thymidine. This is consistent with the time required for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) to induce cells to become competent to respond to additional growth factors present in platelet-poor plasma. Simultaneous addition of IFN with PDGF inhibited the PDGF-induced synthesis of a 29-kilodalton and a 35-kilodalton protein that normally occurs within 1 hour after PDGF addition. IFN also suppressed the general increase in protein synthesis that occurs by the fifth hour after PDGF addition. These results show that IFN antagonizes the action of PDGF, thereby interfering with the activation of Go cells for G1 traverse and S-phase entry."
https://openalex.org/W1597175971,"Three peptides were synthesized corresponding to potential autophosphorylation sites of the beta subunit of the human insulin receptor. These were peptide 1150 corresponding to amino acids 1142-1153 of the pro-receptor, peptide 960 corresponding to amino acids 952-961 of the proreceptor, and peptide 1316 corresponding to amino acids 1313-1329 of the proreceptor. Peptide 1150 served as a better substrate for the insulin receptor tyrosine protein kinase than either of the other peptides or than the Src peptide (corresponding to the sequence surrounding the autophosphorylation site at Tyr-416). Microsequencing of the phosphorylated peptide 1150 indicated that Tyr-1150 rather than Tyr-1146 or Tyr-1151 was phosphorylated in the in vitro reaction. The insulin receptor was then isolated from 32P-labeled IM-9 cells that had been exposed to insulin. Tryptic digestion of the beta subunit revealed one peptide whose phosphorylation was dependent upon insulin and occurred exclusively on Tyr. This peptide was selectively immunoprecipitated by an antipeptide antibody directed to the Tyr-1150-containing sequence. We conclude that Tyr-1150 is preferentially phosphorylated by the purified receptor kinase and that one of the autophosphorylation reactions elicited by insulin in intact cells occurs in a sequence that contains this residue."
https://openalex.org/W1540521479,"Human fibroblasts were insensitive to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alone but were killed when treated with TNF together with the inhibitor of protein synthesis cycloheximide. However, incubation with TNF before addition of cycloheximide protected these cells from cytotoxicity. This suggested that TNF induced some protective mechanism(s) and that protein synthesis was required for this induction. By labeling fibroblasts with [35S]methionine, we observed that TNF induced in these cells the synthesis of two proteins of Mr 36,000 and 42,000 (p36 and p42). This induction was dependent on the TNF concentration and was observed within a few hours after addition of TNF. Actinomycin D prevented synthesis of these proteins, suggesting that TNF induced transcription of the corresponding mRNAs. p42 appeared to be stable, whereas p36 turned over within a few hours. The physiological role of these proteins in the cellular response to TNF remains to be established."
https://openalex.org/W1496512823,"Rat liver 80 S ribosomes were cross-linked with 2-iminothiolane. Proteins extracted from the cross-linked 80 S ribosomes were separated into 25 fractions by chromatography on carboxy methylcellulose. Each protein fraction was analyzed by diagonal polyacrylamide-sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. Eight pairs characteristic of 80 S ribosomes were detected which did not appear when isolated 40 S and 60 S subunits were cross-linked, and the cross-linked proteins were analyzed in similar manners. The cross-linked components were radioiodinated and then analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography. Eight kinds of cross-links between 60 S subunit proteins and 40 S subunit proteins were identified as follows: SA30 (acidic protein with Mr 30,000)-LA33 (acidic protein with Mr 33,000), S2-LA33, S2-L11, S3a-L11, S4-L5, S25-L5, S4-L24 and S6-L24."
https://openalex.org/W1532959248,"The mechanism of the denitrification and nitrosation reactions catalyzed by the heme cd-containing nitrite reductase from Pseudomonas stutzeri JM 300 has been studied with whole cell suspensions using H2(18)O, 15NO, and 15NO-2. The extent of H2(18)O exchange with the enzyme-bound nitrosyl intermediate, as determined by the 18O content of product N2O, decreased with increasing nitrite concentration, which is consistent with production of N2O by sequential reaction of two nitrite ions with the enzyme. Reaction of NO with whole cells in H2(18)O gave amounts of 18O in the N2O product consistent with equilibration of nitric oxide with a small pool of free nitrite. Using 15NO and NH2OH, competition between denitrification and nitrosation reactions was demonstrated, as is required if the enzyme-nitrosyl complex is an intermediate in both nitrosation and denitrification reactions. The first evidence for exchange of 18O between H2(18)O and a nitrosation intermediate occurring after the enzyme-nitrosyl complex, presumably an enzyme-bound nitrosamine, has been obtained. The collective results are most consistent with denitrification N2O originating via attack of NO-2 on a coordinated nitrosyl, as proposed earlier (Averill, B. A., and Tiedje, J. M. (1982) FEBS Lett. 138, 8-11)."
https://openalex.org/W2093745752,"Because of the relation between topology and function, there has been much interest in the structural transitions of the various conformations of DNA polymers. The x-ray fiber diffraction analysis system at the Daresbury Synchrotron Radiation Source was used to study the reversible transition between the B and D forms of the synthetic DNA poly[d(A-T)] ⋅ poly[d(A-T)]. The gradual progression of conformations between these two forms indicates that the DNA double helix does not undergo a change of handedness during this transition."
https://openalex.org/W1504912531,"Sugar transport in human erythrocyte ghosts is modulated by low molecular weight factors present in red cell cytosol that induce an asymmetry in Michaelis and velocity constants for sugar entry and exit (Carruthers, A., and Melchior, D. L. (1983) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 728, 254-266). This study examines the possibility that ATP is the transport-modulating factor. The intracellular factor must satisfy at least three criteria. It must reduce Km and Vmax for sugar efflux from inside-out red cell membrane vesicles. It should increase Km for efflux from red cell ghosts. It should have a molecular weight of less than 10 kDa. These criteria are satisfied by ATP. AMP, ADP, GTP, UTP, and ITP are without effect on sugar transport. The following results support the view that the cytosolic factor is ATP. Red cell lysate (obtained by hypotonic lysis of red cells) is unable to modify transport following dialysis against ATP-free medium. The ability of lysate to modify transport is retained following acid extraction. ATP depletion of acid-extracted lysate by treatment with apyrase results in the loss of transport-modulating potency. Myokinase partly restores both the ATP content and the ability of ATP-depleted (apyrase-treated) lysate to modify transport. Addition of ATP to ATP-depleted lysate mimics the ability to myokinase to restore the transport-modulating potency of lysate. ATP is without effect on the number and molecular size of D-glucose-sensitive cytochalasin B-binding proteins in the red cell membrane. These findings demonstrate that the transport-modulating potency of red cell cytosol is quantitatively accounted for by intracellular ATP which acts to modify the catalytic activity of plasmalemmal transporters."

https://openalex.org/W92181112,"Affinity chromatography of Band 3 was performed using a series of affinity matrices synthesized with various inhibitor ligands and spacer arms. Hydrophilic spacer arms greater than four atoms in length were essential for Band 3 binding. An affinity resin prepared by reacting 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (Ki = 10 microM) with Affi-Gel 102 was found to be the most effective resin of the series tested. Solubilized proteins from human erythrocyte membranes were incubated with the affinity resin, and pure Band 3 was recovered by eluting with 4-benzamido-4'-aminostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (BADS; Ki = 2 microM). Band 3 bound to the resin specifically in its stilbene disulfonate binding site, and optimal binding was achieved at pH 8 and at high ionic strength. At 4 degrees C, up to 80% of the bound Band 3 could be eluted by 1 mM BADS, whereas the remainder could be eluted under denaturing conditions using 1% lithium dodecyl sulfate. At 22 or 37 degrees C, the amount of BADS-elutable Band 3 was reduced with a concomitant increase of Band 3 in the lithium dodecyl sulfate elute. Thus, for successful affinity chromatography, the experiment must be carried out rapidly at 4 degrees C. This procedure was also used to purify the Band 3 protein from mouse, horse, pig, and chicken erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1585024312,"This is a study of the processing of procollagen to collagen in cultures of skin and tendon fibroblasts. Processing was markedly increased by growing cells for 2-4 days postconfluence and then adding ascorbate to the medium for 2 days prior to labeling with [3H] proline. With this system, more than two-thirds of the pro-alpha chains of type I procollagen in the culture medium, and more than 90% of those in the cell layer, were rapidly processed to pC-alpha, pN-alpha, or alpha chains. Purified, exogenous procollagen was also rapidly processed in cell-free culture medium. The results showed for the first time that exogenous procollagen can be processed in conditioned cell-free medium. The system was then used to compare the processing of procollagen in the medium of normal fibroblasts, cells from one bovine and four human variants of osteogenesis imperfecta, and those from eight human variants of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The cells could be divided into three groups, based on their ability to process type I procollagen: normal, consistently slow, and very slow. The cause of the decreased processing was shown to be associated with either a mutation causing a shortening of an alpha chain or decreased activity of procollagen N-proteinase in cell-free culture medium. Decreased processing of procollagen to collagen occurred with cultured fibroblasts from patients with different forms of both osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Both of these disease syndromes are associated with abnormalities in the structure or metabolism of procollagen in fibrous connective tissues, bones, and teeth. The results show that defects in the structure, synthesis, or processing of procollagen are readily demonstrated with cultured fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1518784693,"The soluble catalytic domain of NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase was radiolabeled with [14C]N-ethylmaleimide. Reaction for a limited time resulted in incorporation of 0.41 eq of N-ethylmaleimide and loss of 36% of the enzyme activity. Chromatography on a 5'-ADP affinity column separated the reductase which was modified with N-ethylmaleimide from the unreacted enzyme; the isolated derivative constituted 37% of the total material, was completely inactivated, and contained 1.00 eq of N-ethylmaleimide. Cyanogen bromide cleavage of the derivative demonstrated that radioactivity was limited to a single peptide which contained both Cys-283 and Cys-297. Tryptic hydrolysis of this cyanogen bromide peptide showed that the radioactivity was associated with Cys-283. Automated sequenator analysis confirmed that Cys-283 was the radiolabeled residue. These data demonstrate unambiguously that Cys-283 provides the essential thiol group of cytochrome b5 reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1526232796,"The kinetic parameters of the reaction of horseradish peroxidase with CO have been determined at pH values between 10 and 3. At pH 7.0 the CO binding equilibrium constant L was measured using submicromolar concentrations of horseradish peroxidase; the value obtained corresponds to the ratio of the association and dissociation kinetic constants as expected for a simple binding mechanism to a monomeric hemeprotein. The CO association rate constant is pH-independent below pH 7, whereas in going from pH 7 to pH 11 a 2-fold increase can be detected, as previously reported (Kertesz, D., Antonini, E., Brunori, M., Wyman, J., and Zito, R. (1965) Biochemistry 4, 2672-2676). On the other hand, CO dissociation displays a peculiar pH rate profile characterized by a progressive decrease from pH 10 to pH 5 and by a very marked increase as the pH is further lowered to pH congruent to 3. Furthermore, the rate of CO dissociation is markedly enhanced in peroxidase reconstituted with protoheme dimethyl ester, suggesting a role of the propionates in the regulation of this process."
https://openalex.org/W1513148545,"Complexes containing rat liver 80 S ribosomes, poly(uridylic acid), phenylalanyl-tRNA, elongation factor 1 alpha, and guanylyl(beta, gamma-methylene)-diphosphonate were prepared. Neighboring proteins in the complexes were cross-linked with the bifunctional reagent 2-iminothiolane. Proteins were extracted and then separated into 26 fractions by chromatography on carboxymethylcellulose. Each protein fraction was subjected to diagonal polyacrylamide-sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. Four cross-linked pairs containing elongation factor 1 alpha were on the vertical line below the diagonal. The ribosomal protein spot of each pair was cut out from the gel plate and labeled with 125I. The labeled proteins were extracted from the gel and identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography. The following proteins of both 60 S and 40 S subunits were identified: L12, L23, L39, S23/S24, and S26, three proteins of which had been found to be cross-linked also to elongation factor 2 (Uchiumi, T., Kikuchi, M., Terao, K., Iwasaki, K., and Ogata, K. (1986) Eur. J. Biochem. 156, 37-44). These results afford direct evidence that both elongation factors interact with partially overlapping sites on rat liver ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1545407904,"The ionic strength dependences of yeast and chicken erythrocyte chromatin structure have been examined by analysis of nuclear DNase I and Staphylococcal nuclease digestions done under various salt and divalent cation concentrations. The basic features of yeast DNase I profiles (intracore/intercore patterns and their 5-base pair offset) remain present under all conditions tested. However, there are changes in specific parts of the patterns. In very low salt, the intercore DNase I pattern is enhanced; even very small intercore bands can be detected. Staphylococcal nuclease intracore cleavage becomes prominent. Increasing salt enhances the large DNase I intracore bands and the frequency of spacer cleavage for both nucleases. Thus, yeast has a salt-dependent higher order structure: a chromatin fiber with a prominent spacer/core distinction in (physiological) salt; a fiber with a decreased distinction between spacer and core, i.e. a more uniform fiber, in very low salt. The salt-dependent bulk changes resemble single gene chromatin changes during gene expression and may provide a model for that process. Above bands 16.5-17.5, chicken and yeast intercore patterns are coincident. Thus, at least a fraction of chicken chromatin has discrete length spacers like yeast does. This fraction may be significant, for the prominence of the intercore pattern, and hence the apparent abundance of discrete spacers, can be significantly enhanced by digestion in very low salt. The major differences between the two chromatins are in the intracore/intercore transition region: the region is larger and more complex in chicken; ionic strength changes affect the chicken transition region more strongly. Since this region of the profile corresponds to digestion near the ends of the core, that part of the nucleosome must differ in structure and in conformational flexibility in the two chromatins."
https://openalex.org/W1517926674,"The lysosomal membrane enzyme acetyl-CoA:alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to terminal alpha-linked glucosamine residues of heparan sulfate. The reaction appears to be a transmembrane process: the enzyme is acetylated on the outside of the lysosome, and the acetyl group is transferred across the membrane to the inside of the lysosome where it is used to acetylate glucosamine. To determine the reactive site residues involved in the acetylation reaction, lysosomal membranes were treated with various amino acid modification reagents and assayed for enzyme activity. Although four thiol modification reagents were examined, only one, p-chloromercuribenzoate inactivated the N-acetyltransferase. Thiol modification by p-chloromercuribenzoate did not appear to occur at the active site since inactivation was still observed in the presence of the substrate acetyl-CoA. N-Acetyltransferase could be inactivated by N-bromosuccinimide, even after pretreatment with reagents specific for tyrosine and tryptophan, suggesting that the modified residue is a histidine. Diethyl pyrocarbonate, another histidine modification reagent, could also inactivate the enzyme; this inactivation could be reversed by incubation with hydroxylamine. N-Bromosuccinimide and diethyl pyrocarbonate modifications appear to be at the active site of the enzyme since co-incubation with acetyl-CoA protects the N-acetyltransferase from inactivation. This protection is lost if glucosamine is also present. Pre-acetylated lysosomal membranes are also able to provide protection from N-bromosuccinimide inactivation, providing further evidence for a histidine moiety at the active site and for the existence of an acetyl-enzyme intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1587471612,"Photochemical alterations following ultraviolet irradiation of the alternating copolymer d(GT)n.d(CA)n were studied. We found that in solution conditions which produced circular dichroism spectra compatible with B-form or A-form DNA, no interstrand cross-linking or photoproduct formation could be demonstrated. Zimmer et al. (Zimmer, C., Tymen, S., Marck, C., and Guschlbaumer, W. (1982) Nucleic Acids Res. 10, 1081-1091) and Vorlickova et al. (Vorlickova, M., Kypr, J., Sotkrova, S., Sponar, J. (1982) Nucleic Acids Res. 10, 1071-1080) have reported a number of solution conditions which produce a structural transition of this polymer characterized by a negative deviation of the circular dichroism spectrum in the region of 280 nm. The nature of this transition has not yet been elucidated. Following ultraviolet irradiation of d(GT)n.d(CA)n under two conditions which produce this transition (manganese solution or ethanol plus trace salts solution) we found ultraviolet dose-dependent interstrand cross-linking as well as dose-dependent formation of thymine-containing photoproduct. Interstrand cross-linking is demonstrated by two criteria: increase in polymer size as detected by alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis, and generation of intermediate density material in alkaline cesium sulfate isopycnic gradients. The thymine-containing photo-product was demonstrated by thin layer chromatography of acid hydrolysates of the polymer. The photo-product is at least partially photoreversible. These findings suggest that the geometry of the alternative conformation is such that pyrimidines from different strands are closely approximated, allowing for photodimerization."
https://openalex.org/W1674845299,"Our previous studies (Watson, J. A., Havel, C. M., Lobos, D. V., Baker, F. C., and Morrow, C. J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 14083-14091) suggested that a matabolite, distal to isopentenyl 1-pyrophospate (IPP), served as a regulatory signal for sterol-independent modulation of Kc cell 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity. This report summarizes efforts to localize the potential source of the post-IPP regulatory signal molecule. We found no direct correlation between mevalonate-mediated suppression of Kc cell HMG-CoA reductase activity and the rates of [1-14C]-, [3-14C]-, [5-14C]-, or [5-3H]mevalonate incorporation into either carbon dioxide, neutral lipids, water, or water-soluble isopentenoid pyrophosphate esters. [1-14C]Mevalonate's rate of conversion to 14CO2 (a measure of total isopentenyl 1-pyrophosphate synthesis) was minimally 5-fold greater than that for neutral isopentenoid lipid synthesis (measured with either [5-3H]-, [3-14C]-, or [5-14C]mevalonate). However, [5-3H]mevalonate's rate of conversion into [3H]H2O (measure of shunted mevalonate carbon) was equivalent or greater than that measured for neutral isopentenoid lipid synthesis. [5-14C]Mevalonate radioactivity was incorporated into macromolecules and n-fatty acids. Kc cell extracts (100,000 X g supernatant fluid) readily oxidized alcohols with the following activity sequence: geraniol = nerol greater than farnesol = dimethylallyl alcohol greater than geranylgeraniol, isopentenyl alcohol, and allyl alcohol. Oxidation required NAD, and ethanol was not a substrate. We conclude that (a) Kc cells shunted a significant fraction (greater than or equal to 40%) of their post-IPP carbon to prenols for oxidative catabolism and (b) that shunted mevalonate carbon may play a significant role in the mevalonate-mediated regulation of Kc cell HMG-CoA reductase activity."
https://openalex.org/W304233154,"N-(1-Pyrene)maleimide, a fluorescent, lipophilic, alkylating agent, was used as a probe for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Preincubation with N-(1-pyrene)maleimide under nonreducing conditions inhibits agonist-induced cation permeability of AChR-enriched membranes. This inhibition is dependent on the concentration of N-(1-pyrene)maleimide used. This correlation was also exhibited by resonance energy transfer of tryptophan fluorescence to N-(1-pyrene)maleimide and by the labeling stoichiometries. However, agonist-induced desensitization, as based on the time-dependent inhibition of alpha-bungarotoxin binding upon preincubation with the agonist carbamylcholine, was unaffected by N-(1-pyrene)maleimide. Alkylation of the AChR by N-(1-pyrene)maleimide is pH-dependent with an apparent pKa of 7.5 and is unaffected by preincubation with carbamylcholine, alpha-bungarotoxin, tubocurarine, or decamethonium. Preincubation with a 25-fold molar excess of N-ethylmaleimide partially protects against N-(1-pyrene)maleimide, yet simultaneous incubation with an equimolar concentration does not protect. In contrast, simultaneous incubation with equimolar concentrations of phenylmaleimide or naphthylmaleimide inhibited N-(1-pyrene)maleimide alkylation by 52 and 67%, respectively. Each AChR subunit is labeled by N-(1-pyrene)maleimide. Prior alkylation with N-ethylmaleimide does not alter the labeling profile but lowers the amount of labeling of all subunits. Reductive methylation of membranes under conditions which dimethylate all or most protein amino groups does not inhibit alkylation by N-(1-pyrene)maleimide. The above results, as well as amino acid analysis of N-(1-pyrene)maleimide-alkylated receptor, indicate that a homologous class of cysteines, which reside in each subunit within the AChR domain embedded in the membrane, are involved in the reaction with N-(1-pyrene)maleimide."
https://openalex.org/W1533192201,"Heterodimers of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase from Bacillus stearothermophilus have been produced by mutagenesis at the subunit interface. Oppositely charged groups have been engineered into the subunits so that they can form a complementary pair. Wild-type tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase is a symmetrical dimer in which the side chains of the 2 Phe-164 residues interact at the subunit interface. Phe-164 was mutated to Asp in tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase and to Lys in a truncated enzyme (des-(321-419)tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase) which lacks the two tRNA-binding sites, but which can catalyze pyrophosphate exchange. The size difference allows subunit association to be studied by gel filtration chromatography. These changes induce reversible dissociation from active dimers into inactive monomers at pH values which favor ionization at position 164. A mixture of the two mutants near neutral pH is apparently fully active in pyrophosphate exchange and consists of a heterodimer of [Asp164]tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase and [Lys164]des-(321-419)tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. Despite having only one binding site for tRNA, heterodimer has full aminoacylation activity at high concentrations of tyrosine. We have therefore produced a family of dimers that differ in stability near neutral pH. This novel approach using protein engineering allows specific dimerization of subunits of the same size that have different defined mutations, each subunit being tagged by the charge. Such hybrid proteins can be used to study subunit interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1633896763,"Rabbit muscle has been found to contain an activity that catalyzes the specific removal of Ac-Met from acetylated peptides. The activity is associated with free ribosomes and microsomes in the rabbit muscle extract but can be removed from these subcellular fractions by exposure to 0.5 M NaCl in the presence of 2 mM MgCl2; only partial removal was achieved with microsomes, but complete removal with ribosomes. A nearly 200-fold enrichment of the activity was achieved by this simple succession of differential centrifugation and salt extraction. Eighteen 14C-acetylpeptides have been tested as substrates for the partially purified activity assaying for the production of free 14C-acetylamino acid by high performance liquid chromatography. None of the peptides containing N-terminal acetylated Ala, Asp, Ser, or Gly were cleaved at a significant rate. Six of a total of eight peptides containing N-terminal Ac-Met were cleaved by the ribosomal extract at different rates. The active substrates varied in length from tri- to undecapeptides. The activity is inhibited by high concentrations of the protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Based on these observations, we tentatively conclude that the activity satisfy the criteria of a general N-terminal protein processing enzyme: it can remove Ac-Met from most, but not all, N-terminal sequences and appears to be inactive toward the N-terminal acetylamino acids most commonly found in eukaryotic proteins."
