https://openalex.org/W2024306318,"Caspases are intracellular proteases that function as initiators and effectors of apoptosis. The kinase Akt and p21-Ras, an Akt activator, induced phosphorylation of pro-caspase-9 (pro-Casp9) in cells. Cytochrome c-induced proteolytic processing of pro-Casp9 was defective in cytosolic extracts from cells expressing either active Ras or Akt. Akt phosphorylated recombinant Casp9 in vitro on serine-196 and inhibited its protease activity. Mutant pro-Casp9(Ser196Ala) was resistant to Akt-mediated phosphorylation and inhibition in vitro and in cells, resulting in Akt-resistant induction of apoptosis. Thus, caspases can be directly regulated by protein phosphorylation."

The responsible protease, tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (TACE), has been identified only in the case when tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) is released. Analyses of cells lacking this metalloproteinase-disintegrin revealed an expanded role for TACE in the processing of other cell surface proteins, including a TNF receptor, the l -selectin adhesion molecule, and transforming growth factor-α (TGFα). The phenotype of mice lacking TACE suggests an essential role for soluble TGFα in normal development and emphasizes the importance of protein ectodomain shedding in vivo."

To investigate whether this property can be exploited for cancer therapy, severe combined immune deficient mice bearing tumors established from v- erbB –transformed murine NIH 3T3 cells or human U87 glioblastoma cells were treated with the virus. A single intratumoral injection of virus resulted in regression of tumors in 65 to 80 percent of the mice. Treatment of immune-competent C3H mice bearing tumors established from ras -transformed C3H-10T1/2 cells also resulted in tumor regression, although a series of injections were required. These results suggest that, with further work, reovirus may have applicability in the treatment of cancer."

What kind of cellular activity in which area of the cerebral cortex is involved in selecting an action according to the expected reward value? Results of an analysis in monkeys of cellular activity during the performance of reward-based motor selection and the effects of chemical inactivation are presented. We suggest that cells in the rostral cingulate motor area, one of the higher order motor areas in the cortex, play a part in processing the reward information for motor selection."
https://openalex.org/W1987672004,"Many cell surface proteins are marked for endocytosis by a cytoplasmic sequence motif, tyrosine-X-X-(hydrophobic residue), that is recognized by the mu2 subunit of AP2 adaptors. Crystal structures of the internalization signal binding domain of mu2 complexed with the internalization signal peptides of epidermal growth factor receptor and the trans-Golgi network protein TGN38 have been determined at 2.7 angstrom resolution. The signal peptides adopted an extended conformation rather than the expected tight turn. Specificity was conferred by hydrophobic pockets that bind the tyrosine and leucine in the peptide. In the crystal, the protein forms dimers that could increase the strength and specificity of binding to dimeric receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2034066784,"Microsatellite instability (MSI) has been detected in endometrial carcinomas occurring in women affected by hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal carcinoma (HNPCC) as well as in 20% of presumably sporadic endometrial tumors. While the MSI+ phenotype observed in endometrial tumors from HNPCC patients is attributed to germ line mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes, somatic mutations of known MMR genes are infrequent in MSI+ sporadic endometrial carcinomas. Recently, cytosine methylation of the MLH1 promoter region has been identified in a subset of MSI+ colon primary carcinomas and cell lines. We studied the MLH1 and MSH2 promoter methylation status in 29 presumably sporadic uterine endometrioid carcinomas (UECs), which had previously been characterized for the MSI phenotype and a subset for DNA MMR gene mutational status. We found that 13 (45%) of 29 cases of EC were hypermethylated in the 5′ CpG island of MLH1. Hypermethylation of MSH2 was not observed. MLH1 was hypermethylated in 12 (92%) of 13 MSI+ tumors, while only 1 (6%) of 16 MSI- tumors (Fischer's exact test P<0.0001). Other tumor types we tested did not demonstrate MLH1 promoter hypermethylation. Our data suggest that hypermethylation of MLH1, but not of MSH2, is associated with the MSI phenotype in sporadic endometrial carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W1985620346,"Glycine receptors are anchored at inhibitory chemical synapses by a cytoplasmic protein, gephyrin. Molecular cloning revealed the similarity of gephyrin to prokaryotic and invertebrate proteins essential for synthesizing a cofactor required for activity of molybdoenzymes. Gene targeting in mice showed that gephyrin is required both for synaptic clustering of glycine receptors in spinal cord and for molybdoenzyme activity in nonneural tissues. The mutant phenotype resembled that of humans with hereditary molybdenum cofactor deficiency and hyperekplexia (a failure of inhibitory neurotransmission), suggesting that gephyrin function may be impaired in both diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2117294325,"A family of mesoporous molecular sieves (denoted MSU-G) with vesiclelike hierarchical structures and unprecedented thermal (1000°C) and hydrothermal stabilities (more than 150 hours at 100°C) associated with high SiO 4 cross-linking was prepared through a supramolecular assembly pathway that relies on hydrogen bonding between electrically neutral gemini surfactants of the type C n H 2 n +1 NH(CH 2 ) 2 NH 2 and silica precursors derived from tetraethylorthosilicate. The vesicle shells are constructed of one or more undulated silica sheets that are about 3 nanometers thick with mesopores (average diameters from 2.7 to 4.0 nanometers) running both parallel and orthogonal to the silica sheets, which makes the framework structure bicontinuous and highly accessible. Catalytic metal ion centers [for example, Ti(IV) and Al(III)] have been incorporated into the framework with the retention of hierarchical structure."
https://openalex.org/W2085785716,"The fungal metabolite fumagillin suppresses the formation of new blood vessels, and a fumagillin analog is currently in clinical trials as an anticancer agent. The molecular target of fumagillin is methionine aminopeptidase-2 (MetAP-2). A 1.8 A resolution crystal structure of free and inhibited human MetAP-2 shows a covalent bond formed between a reactive epoxide of fumagillin and histidine-231 in the active site of MetAP-2. Extensive hydrophobic and water-mediated polar interactions with other parts of fumagillin provide additional affinity. Fumagillin-based drugs inhibit MetAP-2 but not MetAP-1, and the three-dimensional structure also indicates the likely determinants of this specificity. The structural basis for fumagillin's potency and specificity forms the starting point for structure-based drug design."
https://openalex.org/W2065570702,"Materials performance in structural applications is often restricted by a transition from ductile response to brittle fracture with decreasing temperature. This transition is currently viewed as being controlled either by dislocation mobility or by the nucleation of dislocations. Fracture experiments on tungsten single crystals reported here provide evidence for the importance of dislocation nucleation for the fracture toughness in the semibrittle regime. However, it is shown that the transition itself, in general, is controlled by dislocation mobility rather than by nucleation."
https://openalex.org/W2161814413,"Fossils discovered in Lower Cretaceous (Aptian) rocks in the Tenere Desert of central Niger provide new information about spinosaurids, a peculiar group of piscivorous theropod dinosaurs. The remains, which represent a new genus and species, reveal the extreme elongation and transverse compression of the spinosaurid snout. The postcranial bones include blade-shaped vertebral spines that form a low sail over the hips. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the enlarged thumb claw and robust forelimb evolved during the Jurassic, before the elongated snout and other fish-eating adaptations in the skull. The close phylogenetic relationship between the new African spinosaurid and Baryonyx from Europe provides evidence of dispersal across the Tethys seaway during the Early Cretaceous."
https://openalex.org/W2061334501,"Higher plants exhibit extensive diversity in the composition of seed storage fatty acids. This is largely due to the presence of various combinations of double or triple bonds and hydroxyl or epoxy groups, which are synthesized by a family of structurally similar enzymes. As few as four amino acid substitutions can convert an oleate 12-desaturase to a hydroxylase and as few as six result in conversion of a hydroxylase to a desaturase. These results illustrate how catalytic plasticity of these diiron enzymes has contributed to the evolution of the chemical diversity found in higher plants."
https://openalex.org/W1992019828,"Previously, we reported that lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of the enzyme HMG CoA reductase also acts as an antimitogenic agent by arresting cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle resulting in cell cycle-independent alteration of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs). In the present study we have investigated the nature of the CKIs (p21 and p27) alterations resulting in G1 arrest in both normal and tumor breast cell lines by lovastatin. We show that even though lovastatin treatment causes G1 arrest in a wide variety of normal and tumor breast cells irrespective of their p53 or pRb status, the p21 and p27 protein levels are not increased in all cell lines treated suggesting that the increase in p21 and p27 protein expression per se is not necessary for lovastatin mediated G1 arrest. However, the binding of p21 and p27 to CDK2 increases significantly following treatment of cells with lovastatin leading to inhibition of CDK2 activity and a subsequent arrest of cells in G1. The increased CKI binding to CDK2 is achieved by the redistribution of both p21 and p27 from CDK4 to CDK2 complexes subsequent to decreases in CDK4 and cyclin D3 expression following lovastatin treatment. Lastly, we show that lovastatin treatment of 76N-E6 breast cell line with an altered p53 pathway also results in G1 arrest and similar redistribution of CKIs from CDK4 to CDK2 as observed in other breast cell lines examined. These observations suggest that lovastatin induced G1 arrest of breast cell lines is through a p53 independent pathway and is mediated by decreased CDK2 activity through redistribution of CKIs from CDK4 to CDK2."
https://openalex.org/W2123650403,"Laser-cooled 9 Be + ions confined in two-dimensionally extended lattice planes were directly observed, and the images were used to characterize the structural phases of the ions. Five different stable crystalline phases were observed, and the energetically favored structure could be sensitively tuned by changing the areal density of the confined ions. The experimental results are in good agreement with theoretical predictions for the planar (infinite in two dimensions) one-component plasma. Qualitatively similar structural phase transitions occur, or are predicted to occur, in other experimentally realizable planar systems."
https://openalex.org/W2031599457,"The present study was designed to investigate the mechanism through which leucine and histidine regulate translation initiation in L6 myoblasts. The results show that both amino acids stimulate initiation and coordinately regulate the activity of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2B. The changes in eIF2B activity could be explained in part by modulation of the phosphorylation state of the α-subunit of eIF2. The activity changes might also be a result of modulation of the phosphorylation state of the eIF2B ε-subunit, because deprivation of either amino acid caused a decrease in eIF2Bε kinase activity. Leucine, but not histidine, additionally caused a redistribution of eIF4E from the inactive eIF4E·4E-BP1 complex to the active eIF4E·eIF4G complex. The redistribution was a result of increased phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. The changes in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and eIF4E redistribution associated with leucine deprivation were not observed in the presence of insulin. However, the leucine- and histidine-induced alterations in global protein synthesis and eIF2B activity were maintained in the presence of the hormone. Overall, the results suggest that both leucine and histidine regulate global protein synthesis through modulation of eIF2B activity. Furthermore, under the conditions employed herein, alterations in eIF4E availability are not rate-controlling for global protein synthesis but might be necessary for regulation of translation of specific mRNAs.

Amino acids play important and multiple roles in regulating protein synthesis in skeletal muscle (1May M.E. Buse M.G. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 227-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). An obvious role is to act as precursors for protein synthesis. A less obvious but equally important role involves the regulation of translation initiation. The initiation of mRNA translation is a complicated process involving over a dozen proteins, referred to as eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs)1 (reviewed in Refs. 2Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholarand 3Redpath N.T. Proud C.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1220: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Of all the steps in the initiation pathway, only two have been identified that are subject to regulation in vivo; the binding of tRNAiMet to the 40 S ribosomal subunit and the binding of mRNA to the 43 S preinitiation complex. In the first step in initiation, tRNAiMet binds to the 40 S ribosomal subunit as a ternary complex with eIF2 and GTP. Subsequently, the GTP bound to eIF2 is hydrolyzed to GDP, and eIF2 is released from the ribosomal subunit as a complex with GDP. Formation of the ternary complex is regulated by modulation of the activity of a second initiation factor, eIF2B, which mediates guanine nucleotide exchange on eIF2. It is regulated by phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eIF2, where phosphorylation converts eIF2 from a substrate into a competitive inhibitor of eIF2B. The binding of mRNA to the 43 S preinitiation complex involves a group of proteins collectively referred to as eIF4 (reviewed in Refs. 2Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholarand 4Morley S.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The protein that binds to the m7GTP cap present at the 5′-end of most eukaryotic mRNAs is termed eIF4E. The eIF4E·mRNA complex binds to the 40 S ribosomal subunit through the association of eIF4E with eIF4G. An important mechanism for regulating the binding of mRNA to the 40 S ribosomal subunit occurs through sequestration of eIF4E into an inactive complex with the eIF4E binding protein, 4E-BP1 (5Lin T.-A. Kong X. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 6Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donze O. Lin T.-A. Lawrence J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). The eIF4E·4E-BP1 complex can still bind to the m7GTP cap structure but not to eIF4G (7Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 8Mader S. Lee H. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, binding of eIF4E to 4E-BP1 prevents the binding of mRNA to the ribosome. The binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E is regulated by phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 with increased phosphorylation of the protein causing a decrease in the affinity of 4E-BP1 for eIF4E. In skeletal muscle in vivo as well as in perfused muscle preparations, protein synthesis is stimulated by amino acids through a mechanism involving an increase in the rate of translation initiation (reviewed in Ref. 1May M.E. Buse M.G. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 227-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The stimulation of initiation caused by a complete mixture of amino acids can be reproduced by provision of only the branched chain amino acids (9Buse M.G. Reid S.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 56: 1250-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 10Fulks R.M. Li J.B. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 290-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, of the branched chain amino acids, leucine has been shown to stimulate initiation in the absence of other amino acids (11Li J.B. Jefferson L.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 544: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), suggesting that it plays a key role in the regulation of protein synthesis. However, although leucine has been known to stimulate protein synthesis in muscle for years, the mechanism through which it acts on initiation is still unknown. Leucine also stimulates initiation in tissues other than skeletal muscle (1May M.E. Buse M.G. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 227-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, in tissues such as liver, leucine is not the only amino acid that can regulate initiation. In particular, in rat liver, histidine stimulates initiation through a mechanism involving changes in the phosphorylation state of the α-subunit of eIF2 (eIF2α) (12Kimball S.R. Antonetti D.A. Brawley R.M. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1969-1976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The decreased phosphorylation of eIF2 caused by histidine is associated with a stimulation of eIF2B activity. Whether leucine has a similar effect on eIF2 phosphorylation in liver or muscle is unknown. In the present study, the mechanism through which leucine and histidine regulate translation initiation was examined in L6 myoblasts. ECL detection reagents and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig and donkey anti-rabbit Ig were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was obtained from Bio-Rad. 35S-Easytag Express protein labeling mix was from NEN Life Science Products. The antibody against p70S6k was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. DMEM lacking either leucine or histidine was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) substrate and control peptides were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. L6 myoblast cells were grown in culture in 100-mm dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Labs, Inc), 100 units/ml benzylpenicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cells were grown to approximately 70% confluence and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline; dishes were then randomly divided into three groups. Dishes in the first group received serum-free DMEM, the second group received serum-free DMEM lacking leucine, and the third group received serum-free DMEM lacking histidine. The cells were returned to the incubator for 60 min, at which time insulin was added to some of the dishes in each group to a final concentration of 20 nm. This concentration of the hormone was found in an earlier study to be maximally effective in activating p70S6k (13Kimball S.R. Horetsky R.L. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C221-C228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, leucine was added to some of the dishes in group 2, and histidine was added to some of the dishes in group 3. In each case, the final concentration of leucine or histidine was the same as in complete DMEM. The cells were returned to the incubator, and 30 min later all dishes received 10 μl of35S-Easytag Express protein labeling mix (22 mCi/ml). Thirty min after the addition of radiolabel, cells were harvested by scraping in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 2.5% Triton X-100, 0.25% deoxycholate, 50 mm NaF, 1 μm microcystin LR, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mmbenzamidine, 0.8 μm leupeptin, and 0.6 μmpepstatin). Protein synthesis in L6 myoblasts was monitored by measuring the incorporation of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine into protein as described previously (14Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16794-16798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (approximately 2 × 106) were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 400 μl of ice-cold buffer B (45 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 0.375 mm magnesium acetate, 0.075 mm EDTA, 95 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mg/ml digitonin, and 10% glycerol). The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were assayed for the exchange of [3H]GDP bound to eIF2 for unlabeled GDP as described previously (15Kimball S.R. Everson W.V. Flaim K.E. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C28-C34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). L6 myoblasts were washed twice with 3.0 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed using a Dounce homogenizer in buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.0, 0.3 mm ATP (42 Ci/mol), 10 mm magnesium chloride, 5% glycerol, 4.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm benzamidine, and 0.03 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of the supernatant (20 μl) were added to tubes containing 30 μl of a solution consisting of 1.5 μg of recombinant eIF2Bε (expressed in and purified from Sf9 insect cells using the baculovirus expression system as described previously (16Fabian J.R. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)), and (final concentrations) 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.0, 0.3 mm ATP (43 Ci/mol), 10 mm magnesium chloride, 5% glycerol, 4.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm benzamidine, and 0.03 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C, and at various times 10 μl of the reaction mixture were removed and placed in a separate tube containing 10 μl of SDS sample buffer at 90 °C. The samples were incubated at 90 °C for 4 min and then were resolved by electrophoresis on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel as described previously (17Kimball S.R. Karinch A.M. Feldhoff R.C. Mellor H. Jefferson L.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The stained gel was dried and exposed to film. The results were analyzed by scanning densitometry. L6 myoblast homogenates were prepared and centrifuged as described in the previous paragraph, except that the homogenization buffer consisted of 8 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm benzamidine. Aliquots (12.5 μl) of the supernatant were assayed for GSK-3 activity at 30 °C in a 50-μl reaction consisting of 4 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20 mm magnesium chloride, 250 μm [32P]ATP (1.6 Ci/mol), and 62.5 μm of either control or substrate peptide. The control peptide is identical to the substrate peptide except that the serine at the GSK-3 phosphorylation site was changed to an alanine. At various times, 10 μl of the reaction mixture were removed and placed in a tube on ice containing 10 μl of stop buffer (2% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm ATP, and 1 m HCl). Ice-cold 25% trichloroacetic acid (5 μl) was added to each tube followed by incubation on ice for 5 min. The tubes were then centrifuged at 8500 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, and 20 μl of supernatant were spotted onto 2.1-cm P81 filter disks (Whatman). The filters were incubated in ice-cold 0.75% phosphoric acid (5 ml/filter) for 5 min. The filters were then washed consecutively with ice-cold 0.75% phosphoric acid (twice), water, and 95% ethanol (twice). The filters were dried and radiation bound to the filters was quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. GSK-3 activity was calculated as the difference in the amount of 32Piincorporated into the substrate compared with the control peptide. Blots were developed using an Amersham ECL Western blotting kit as described previously (17Kimball S.R. Karinch A.M. Feldhoff R.C. Mellor H. Jefferson L.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Films were scanned using a Microtek ScanMaker III scanner equipped with a transparent media adapter connected to a Macintosh PowerMac 7100 computer. Images were obtained using the ScanWizard Plugin (Microtek) for Adobe Photoshop and quantitated using NIH Image software. L6 myoblasts were maintained in culture as described above with the exception that the cells were grown on 60 mm, instead of 100 mm, dishes. In addition, cells were harvested by scraping in SDS sample buffer at 90 °C as described previously (18Mellor H. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation state of eIF2α then was determined by two different methods. In the first method, the relative amount of eIF2α in the phosphorylated form was quantitated by protein immunoblot analysis using an affinity-purified antibody that specifically recognizes eIF2α phosphorylated at Ser51(eIF2(αP)) (Ref. 19DeGracia D.J. Sullivan J.M. Neuman R.W. Alousi S.S. Hikade K.R. Pittman J.E. Rafols J.A. Krause G.S. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1997; 17: 1291-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar; kindly provided by Drs. Gary S. Krause and Donald J. DeGracia, Wayne State University School of Medicine). For this analysis, samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins in the gel were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described previously (17Kimball S.R. Karinch A.M. Feldhoff R.C. Mellor H. Jefferson L.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The membranes were incubated with the anti-eIF2(αP) antibody, and the blots were developed using an ECL Western blot kit as described above. The horseradish peroxidase coupled to the anti-rabbit secondary antibody was then inactivated by incubating the blot in 15% H2O2 for 30 min at room temperature. The total amount of eIF2α in the samples was determined by reprobing the blot with a monoclonal antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Richard Panniers, National Institutes of Health) that equally recognizes the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of eIF2α (20Scorsone K.A. Panniers R. Rowlands A.G. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14538-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by an anti-mouse secondary antibody. Values obtained using the anti-eIF2(αP) antibody were normalized for the total amount of eIF2α present in the sample. In the second method, the proportion of eIF2α present in the phosphorylated form was determined by protein immunoblot analysis following separation of the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of the protein using slab gel isoelectric focusing electrophoresis. Aliquots of the samples in SDS sample buffer were heated at 100 °C for 3 min, cooled to room temperature, and then mixed with 0.8 volumes of isoelectric focusing gel buffer (0.1 g dithiothreitol, 0.4 g of CHAPS, 5.4 g of urea, and 1 ml of ampholytes (pH 3.5–9.5 from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 6 ml of water). Samples were resolved by isoelectric focusing followed by protein immunoblot analysis using the monoclonal anti-eIF2α antibody as described previously (21Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Quantitation of 4E-BP1·eIF4E and eIF4G·eIF4E Complexes—The association of eIF4E with 4E-BP1 or eIF4G was quantitated by a modification of the method described previously (22Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C705-C709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, eIF4E and the 4E-BP1·eIF4E and eIF4G·eIF4E complexes were immunoprecipitated from aliquots of cell homogenate using the anti-eIF4E monoclonal antibody. The eIF4E antibody was raised against recombinant human eIF4E as described previously (23Kimball S.R. Jurasinski C.V. Lawrence J.C. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C754-C759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The efficiency of eIF4E immunoprecipitation was greater than 90% under all conditions. The antibody·antigen complex was collected by incubation for 1 h with goat anti-mouse Biomag IgG beads (PerSeptive Diagnostics). Before use, the beads were washed in 1% nonfat dry milk in buffer C (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Triton X-100). The beads were captured using a magnetic stand and washed twice with buffer C and once with buffer D (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.04% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate). Protein bound to the beads was eluted by resuspending the beads in SDS sample buffer and boiling the sample for 5 min. The beads were collected by centrifugation, and the supernatants were subjected to electrophoresis either on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel for quantitation of eIF4G or on a 15% polyacrylamide gel for quantitation of 4E-BP1 and eIF4E. Proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described previously (17Kimball S.R. Karinch A.M. Feldhoff R.C. Mellor H. Jefferson L.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The membranes were incubated with a mouse anti-human eIF4E antibody, a rabbit anti-rat 4E-BP1 antibody, or a rabbit anti-human eIF4G antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The antibodies against 4E-BP1 and eIF4G were raised against the recombinant rat and human proteins, respectively, by the method described previously (24Kimball S.R. Rannels S.L. Elensky M.B. Jefferson L.S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 106: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The blots then were developed using an ECL Western blotting kit as described above. Aliquots of cell homogenates were immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal anti-4E-BP1 antibody using the method described in the previous section for immunoprecipitation of eIF4E. The 4E-BP1 antibody was raised against the rat recombinant protein by the method described previously (17Kimball S.R. Karinch A.M. Feldhoff R.C. Mellor H. Jefferson L.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were solubilized with SDS sample buffer and then subjected to protein immunoblot analysis using a rabbit anti-rat 4E-BP1 antibody. An aliquot of L6 cell homogenate was combined with an equal volume of SDS sample buffer, and the diluted samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The samples were then analyzed by protein immunoblot analysis using rabbit anti-rat p70S6k polyclonal antibodies as described above. The effect of leucine or histidine deprivation on the rate of global protein synthesis in L6 myoblasts was examined by incubating cells in serum-free medium lacking either leucine or histidine for 60 min followed by readdition of the deprived amino acid for 30 min. The results were compared with cells maintained in medium with a complete mixture of amino acids. As shown in Fig. 1 A, deprivation of either amino acid caused a reduction in protein synthesis to approximately 50% that of the rate observed in cells maintained in complete serum-free medium. Cells maintained in serum-free DMEM containing all amino acids will be referred to hereafter as controls. Readdition of the deprived amino acid rapidly returned protein synthesis to control values. In a previous study using perfused rat liver, the inhibition of protein synthesis caused by histidine deprivation was attributed to a reduction in the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of eIF2B (12Kimball S.R. Antonetti D.A. Brawley R.M. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1969-1976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, deprivation of either leucine or histidine also caused a significant decline in the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of eIF2B in L6 myoblasts (Fig. 1 B). Readdition of the deprived amino acid rapidly restored eIF2B activity to the value observed in control cells. In both mammalian cells (12Kimball S.R. Antonetti D.A. Brawley R.M. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1969-1976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and yeast (26Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), the inhibition of eIF2B activity caused by deprivation of histidine is associated with an increase in phosphorylation of eIF2α. To determine whether leucine or histidine deprivation caused a similar effect in L6 myoblasts, cell homogenates were subjected to protein immunoblot analysis using an antibody that recognizes eIF2α only when it is phosphorylated at Ser51 (19DeGracia D.J. Sullivan J.M. Neuman R.W. Alousi S.S. Hikade K.R. Pittman J.E. Rafols J.A. Krause G.S. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1997; 17: 1291-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 C, the amount of phosphorylated eIF2α increased approximately 2.5-fold in response to deprivation of either leucine or histidine compared with the amount in control cells. Readdition of the deprived amino acid completely reversed the increased phosphorylation of eIF2(αP). However, as described below, the amount of eIF2α in the phosphorylated form represents a relatively low proportion of the total protein. The mechanism through which eIF2α phosphorylation causes an inhibition of eIF2B activity involves an increased affinity of eIF2B for phosphorylated compared with unphosphorylated eIF2 (reviewed in Ref. 2Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The increased affinity of eIF2B for eIF2(αP) results in the effective sequestration of eIF2B into an inactive complex, with eIF2(αP) inhibiting eIF2B on an approximately equimolar basis. Thus, to inhibit eIF2B activity completely, an equimolar amount of eIF2(αP) must be present. To establish whether the change in eIF2α phosphorylation shown in Fig. 1 C could account for the observed change in protein synthesis, both the proportion of eIF2α in the phosphorylated form as well as the molar concentrations of eIF2 and eIF2B were determined. As shown in Fig. 2, phosphorylated eIF2α was almost undetectable in control cells. Furthermore, although the exact proportion in the phosphorylated form was too low to be accurately measured, the proportion that was phosphorylated in amino acid-deprived cells was no more than 5% that of the total. Because the cells were harvested directly into SDS sample buffer at 90 °C, it is unlikely that the low proportion of eIF2α in the phosphorylated form was a result of dephosphorylation that occurred during sample preparation. In most eukaryotic cells, the molar ratio of eIF2 to eIF2B is in the range of 2–5:1 (17Kimball S.R. Karinch A.M. Feldhoff R.C. Mellor H. Jefferson L.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Oldfield S. Jones B.L. Tanton D. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 399-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). If the ratio is similar in L6 myoblasts, then an increase in the amount of eIF2(αP) to 5% that of total eIF2 could not account for the 50% decrease in protein synthesis caused by amino acid deprivation. Therefore, the amounts of the two proteins were measured in L6 myoblasts using protein immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3, the ratio of eIF2 to eIF2B in L6 myoblasts is approximately 2:1. Thus, if 1 mol of eIF2(αP) inhibits approximately 1 mol of eIF2B, then phosphorylation of eIF2α cannot account completely for the inhibition of protein synthesis caused by amino acid deprivation in L6 myoblasts. An alternative mechanism for the change in eIF2B activity in response to leucine and histidine availability might be a change in the phosphorylation state of the ε-subunit of eIF2B. However, a direct examination of eIF2Bε phosphorylation, for example by32Pi labeling, is complicated because the protein has at least four sites that can be phosphorylated by three known eIF2ε kinases (28Aroor A.R. Denslow N.D. Singh L.P. O'Brien T.W. Wahba A.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3350-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 29Singh L.P. Aroor A.R. Wahba A.J.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In an attempt to circumvent this problem, others (31Welsh G.I. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 32Welsh G.I. Foulstone E.J. Young S.W. Tavare J.M. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) have measured eIF2Bε kinase activity rather than 32Pi incorporation. In those studies, GSK-3 was implicated as the kinase that mediated the increase in eIF2B activity in insulin-stimulated CHO.T cells. However, in the present study, no change in GSK-3 activity was observed in extracts of L6 myoblasts deprived of either leucine or histidine (Fig. 4 A). Because kinases other than GSK-3 have been shown to phosphorylate eIF2Bε, we also measured eIF2Bε kinase activity in extracts of L6 myoblasts using purified, recombinant eIF2Bε as substrate. As shown in Fig. 4 B, deprivation of either leucine or histidine caused a significant decrease in eIF2Bε kinase activity. Therefore, changes in eIF2B activity in response to leucine or histidine deprivation correlate directly with changes in eIF2Bε kinase activity, and the kinase activity involved is unlikely to be GSK-3. To further define the mechanisms through which amino acids regulate translation initiation, the effect of leucine or histidine deprivation on a second potential regulatory step, the binding of mRNA to the 40 S ribosomal subunit, was examined. Under a variety of conditions, the binding of mRNA to the ribosome is regulated through modulation of the association of eIF4E with eIF4G and 4E-BP1 (33Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 293-310PubMed Google Scholar, 34Morley S.J. Curtis P.S. Pain V.M. RNA (N.Y.). 1997; 3: 1085-1104PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the effect of leucine or histidine deprivation on the association of eIF4E with eIF4G was examined by immunoprecipitation of eIF4E and the eIF4E·eIF4G complex from L6 myoblast homogenates followed by protein immunoblot analysis to quantify the amount of the two proteins in the immunoprecipitate. As shown in Fig. 5 A, leucine deprivation caused a 50% decrease in the amount of eIF4G that co-precipitated with eIF4E. The readdition of leucine to the medium of leucine-deprived cells rapidly returned the amount of eIF4G associated with eIF4E to control values. In contrast to the results observed with leucine, deprivation of histidine had no effect on the association of eIF4E with eIF4G, despite the fact that histidine deprivation was equally effective as leucine in inhibiting protein synthesis. The association of eIF4E with 4E-BP1 was similarly examined by immunoprecip"

(1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 10408–10413). The study at hand was performed to answer the question of whether OCT2 accepts dopamine and other monoamine transmitters as substrate. 293 cells were stably transfected with the OCT2r cDNA resulting in the 293OCT2r cell line.

The inactivation of released hormones and neurotransmitters is essential for chemical signal transduction. The inactivation of monoamine transmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, and 5-hydroxytryptamine is brought about by neuronal and non-neuronal (extraneuronal) membrane-bound transport systems. These transport mechanisms actively remove the monoamine transmitters from the extracellular space and thus terminate their biological actions. The primary structures of a variety of sodium-dependent neuronal transport systems for biogenic amines have recently been elucidated (1Amara S. Kuhar M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 73-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 2Borowski B. Hoffman B. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1995; 38: 139-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the molecular correlates of the transporter or transporters responsible for extraneuronal monoamine uptake are still unknown. The use of a novel class of potent inhibitors of extraneuronal monoamine transport revealed that extraneuronal mechanisms contribute markedly to the inactivation of circulating catecholamines (3Eisenhofer G. McCarty R. Pacak K. Russ H. Schömig E. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch Pharmacol. 1996; 354: 287-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pharmacological characterization of extraneuronal monoamine transport in tissue culture suggests an unexpected but nevertheless close pharmacological relationship between extraneuronal monoamine transport and the secretion of organic cations through the apical plasma membrane of renal proximal tubule cells (4Schömig E. Babin-Ebell J. Russ H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1993; 347: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recently, the apical renal transport system for organic cations (OCT2)1 has been cloned from LLC-PK1 porcine kidney cells, rat kidney, and human kidney (5Gründemann D. Babin-Ebell J. Martel F.

Based on the tissue distribution of the OCT2 mRNA, the hypothesis has been raised that OCT2 is involved in dopamine handling. The OCT2 mRNA was found to exist not only in the kidney but also in dopamine-rich brain areas of the rat (5Gründemann D. Babin-Ebell J. Martel F. Örding N. Schmidt A. Schömig E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10408-10413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The present study was designed to answer the question whether OCT2 accepts monoamine transmitters as substrates. If not stated otherwise, standard molecular biology techniques were employed (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For the construction of pcDNA3OCT2r, the cDNA of OCT2r has been released from pBluescript II OCT2r by restriction with HindIII and XhoI and inserted into the corresponding polylinker site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). pcDNA3 is a eukaryotic expression vector that carries an aminoglycoside resistance cassette. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573) (9Graham F. Smiley J. Russell W. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (3512) Google Scholar) were transfected by a cationic liposome technique with the Tfx-50 reagent (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Selection was carried out with the aminoglycoside Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The 293OCT2r cells were derived from an isolated transfected cell obtained by single cell cloning. Success of stable transfection of the 293OCT2rcells was tested by RT-PCR and functional experiments (see “Results”). For control purposes, 293pcDNA3 cells were constructed that were stably transfected with the empty expression vector pcDNA3. 293WT refers to wild-type 293 cells. Total RNA was extracted from 293WT and 293OCT2r cells (10Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Remaining DNA was degraded by 1 unit/10 μg of RNA RQ1-DNase (Boehringer Ingelheim Bioproducts, Heidelberg, Germany). After phenol-chloroform extraction, ethanol precipitation, and first strand cDNA synthesis with Superscript II RT (Life Technologies, Eggenstein, Germany), PCR (34 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, followed by a final elongation of 10 min at 72 °C) was carried out essentially as described elsewhere (5Gründemann D.

The cell lines were grown in surface culture on standard tissue culture plastic materials. After a preincubation period of 30 min at 37 °C with buffer A (125 mmol/liter NaCl, 4.8 mmol/liter KCl, 1.2 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1.2 mmol/liter KH2PO4, 1.2 mmol/liter MgSO4, 25 mmol/liter HEPES·NaOH, pH 7.4, 5.6 mmol/liter D(+)-glucose), the cells were incubated with 100 nmol/liter3H-labeled substrates in buffer A. Where appropriate, transport inhibitors were present during both the preincubation and incubation periods. Incubation was stopped by rinsing the cells four times with 3 ml of ice-cold buffer A. Subsequently, the cells were solubilized with 0.1% v/v Triton X-100 (dissolved in 5 mmol/liter Tris·HCl, pH 7.4), and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The specific activity of the used radiosubstrates was adjusted to result in uninhibited uptake values of about 500 cpm per culture dish. L(+)-ascorbic acid (1 mmol/liter) was present in all experiments. Where appropriate, intracellular metabolism via monoamine oxidase (MAO) and/or catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) was blocked by 10 μmol/liter pargyline alone (in the case of 5-HT) or by 10 μmol/liter pargyline and 10 μmol/liter U-0521 (in the case of dopamine, noradrenaline, or adrenaline). The kidneys were removed from adult Sprague-Dawley rats perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and 18% sucrose solution in PBS. 14-μm cryostat sections were mounted on poly-l-lysine-coated slides and postfixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. The slides were washed in DEPC-treated water and subsequently in 0.1 m HCl. Next, the sections were acetylated for 20 min in 0.1 m triethanolamine (pH 8.0) containing 0.25% acetic anhydride and, after rinsing in PBS, dehydrated in ethanol (70 and 96%) and air-dried. Digoxigenin-labeling and nonradioactive in situ hybridization was carried out essentially as described elsewhere (11Obermüller N. Kränzlin B. Verma R. Gretz N. Kriz W. Witzgall R Kidney Int. 1997; 52: 1584-1592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Digoxigenin-11-UTP labeled sense and antisense RNA probes were prepared from a 1.63-kilobase fragment of the rat OCT2 cDNA and shortened by alkaline hydrolysis to an average length of 250 bases. The sections were hybridized at 42 °C for 16 h and washed at 49 °C in 1× and 0.5× SSC containing 50% formamide and finally in 0.5× and 0.2× SSC at 20 °C. Incubation with alkaline-phosphatase-coupled anti-digoxigenin antibodies and the subsequent color reaction were done according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). Protein was determined by the method of Lowry (12Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The analysis of the time course of substrate accumulation was based on a 1-compartment model as described earlier (13Russ H. Gliese M. Sonna J. Schömig E. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1992; 346: 158-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For the calculation of IC50 values, the parameters of the Hill equation for multisite inhibition (14Segel I. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley, New York1975Google Scholar) were fitted to the experimental data by a nonlinear computer-assisted quasi Newton method (15Wilkinson L. SYSTAT: The System for Statistics, Version 5. SYSTAT Inc., Evanston, IL1989Google Scholar). The IC50 values are identical withK i values since nonsaturating substrate concentrations were used (16Cheng Y.-C. Prusoff W. Biochem.

Engel W. Schömig E. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 4208-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Success of stable transfection was tested by RT-PCR. 8 weeks after transfection with pcDNA3OCT2r, total RNA was prepared from the Geneticin-resistant clonal 293OCT2r cells and, for control purposes, from wild-type 293 cells. With RNA from 293OCT2r, RT-PCR with primers for OCT2r resulted in the amplification of the expected 795-base pair long PCR product. With RNA from 293WT cells, there was no amplification product. Stable transfection was also confirmed by functional testing. Upon incubation with 100 nmol/liter, initial rates of uptake of the prototypical organic cation 3H-MPP+ in 293OCT2r cells and 293pcDNA3 control cells amounted to 1.9 and 0.09 pmol min−1·mg of protein−1, respectively (n = 2). Specific uptake of tritiated adrenaline, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), noradrenaline, and dopamine were analyzed in 293OCT2r cells and, for control purposes, in 293pcDNA3 cells. After preincubation of 30 min in buffer A, the cells were incubated for 6 min at 37 °C in the presence of one of the labeled amines. Intracellular metabolism of the respective amine was blocked (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). Specific uptake was defined as that fraction of total uptake which was sensitive to 1 μmol/liter decynium22. Decynium22 is a potent inhibitor of OCT2, the K i being 5.6 nmol/liter (4Schömig E. Babin-Ebell J. Russ H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1993; 347: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The expressed transport activity for a given substrate reflects the transport activity induced by the expression of OCT2r,i.e. transport activity in 293OCT2r cells minus uptake into 293pcDNA3 control cells. The expression of OCT2r induced specific uptake of all tested monoamine transmitters (Fig. 1). The transport efficiencies ranged from 3.4 ± 0.3 μl/(mg of protein·min) for adrenaline to 1.0 ± 0.2 μl/(mg of protein·min) for dopamine. Transport of dopamine by 293OCT2r cells was analyzed in more detail. For this purpose, 293OCT2r cells and 293pcDNA3 cells were incubated with 100 nmol/liter3H-dopamine either in the absence or in the presence of 1 μmol/liter decynium22. 3H-dopamine accumulation increased almost linearly for about 10 min (Fig. 2). The rate constants for total inwardly and outwardly directed 3H-dopamine flux for 293OCT2r cells were 4.4 ± 0.5 μl (n= 15) and 0.05 ± 0.01 min−1 (n = 15), respectively. In other words, an amount of 293OCT2rcells that corresponds to 1 mg of cell protein clears 4.4 μl of incubation medium of 3H-dopamine/min, and simultaneously 5% of intracellular 3H-dopamine leaves the cells per minute. At equilibrium, the intracellular accumulation of3H-dopamine amounted to 8.9 ± 1.3 pmol·mg of protein−1 (n = 15) in 293OCT2rcells. Based on the known water space of 293 cells (18Martel F. Vetter T. Russ H. Gründemann D. Azevedo I. Koepsell H. Schömig E. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1996; 354: 320-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this accumulation translates into a factor of intracellular accumulation at equilibrium of 13. Initial rates of specific 3H-dopamine transport in 293OCT2r cells were saturable. The half-saturating concentration was 2.1 (0.7, 5.9) mmol/liter, and the maximal initial rate of 3H-dopamine uptake amounted to 3.9 ± 0.8 nmol·min−1·mg of protein−1(n = 15). The corresponding Scatchard plot is compatible with simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig. 3 and Table I). For comparison, the corresponding kinetic constants for specific 3H-noradrenaline,3H-adrenaline, and 3H-5-hydroxytryptamine uptake in 293OCT2r cells were determined (Table I).Table IKinetic constants of expressed monoamine transport into 293OCT2r cellsSubstrateKmVmaxK iD24Corticosteronemmol/liternmol · min−1 · mg−1nmol/literDopamine2.1 (0.7, 5.9)3.9 ± 0.85.1 (2.6, 9.9)390 (310, 500)(−)Noradrenaline4.4 (1.2, 16)1.0 ± 0.313 (7, 23)460 (180, 1200)(−)Adrenaline1.9 (0.93, 3.7)0.59 ± 0.0612 (10, 14)420 (210, 850)5-Hydroxytryptamine3.6 (0.42, 31)2.5 ± 1.313 (7, 26)605 (180, 2100)K m values (n = 12) and K i values (n = 5) are given as geometric means with 95% confidence interval.

The effects of known inhibitors of neuronal, vesicular, and extraneuronal monoamine transport systems were determined to distinguish dopamine transport via OCT2r from known monoamine transport systems. After preincubation of 20 min, 293OCT2r cells and 293pcDNA3 cells were incubated for 6 min at 37 °C with 100 nmol/liter 3H-dopamine in the absence and presence of cocaine (1 μmol/liter), reserpine (30 nmol/liter), and O-methylisoprenaline (30 μmol/liter). The inhibitors were present during both the preincubation and incubation periods but failed to interact significantly with OCT2r (Fig. 4). The inhibitory potencies of two known inhibitors of OCT2, disprocynium24 and corticosterone, were measured (Table I and Fig. 5). Because nonsaturating concentrations of the labeled substrates (0.1 μmol/liter) were used, the IC50 values are identical with the correspondingK i values. Disprocynium24 and corticosterone inhibited monoamine transport by OCT2r with K ivalues of about 10 and 500 nmol/liter, respectively. Cryostat sections of adult rat kidney were hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probes transcribed from a 1.63-base pair fragment of OCT2r. OCT2r transcripts were detected in tubule cells of the outer stripe of the medulla as well as in deep portions of the medullary rays (Fig. 6). This pattern indicates exclusive OCT2 mRNA expression in proximal tubule cells of the S3 segment. Proximal tubules of the S1 and S2 segment as well as other structures in renal cortex and medulla such as glomeruli, distal tubules, collecting ducts, and blood vessels were unreactive for the hybridization probe (Fig. 6). On alternate sections, the corresponding sense probe did not produce any detectable signal (not shown). The primary structure of a new renal transport system for organic cations (OCT2p) has recently been elucidated by molecular cloning from LLC-PK1 porcine kidney cells (5Gründemann D. Babin-Ebell J. Martel F. Örding N. Schmidt A. Schömig E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10408-10413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). OCT2p and OCT2r, the orthologue from rat kidney which has first been reported by Okudaet al. (6Okuda M. Saito H. Urakami Y. Takano M. Inui K.-I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), upon heterologous expression in 293 cells, induce saturable transport of prototypical organic cations such as tetraethylammonium and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). The pharmacological properties clearly demonstrate that OCT2p is identical with the transport system for organic cations that is expressed in the apical but not the basolateral plasma membrane of LLC-PK1 cells (4Schömig E. Babin-Ebell J. Russ H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1993; 347: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 5Gründemann D. Babin-Ebell J. Martel F. Örding N. Schmidt A. Schömig E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10408-10413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). LLC-PK1 cells, a widely used established cell line from porcine kidney (19Hull R. Cherry W. Weaver G. In Vitro. 1976; 12: 670-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), display many properties characteristic of proximal tubular epithelial cells (20Gstraunthaler G. Renal Physiol. Biochem. 1988; 11: 1-42PubMed Google Scholar). Two recently reported findings open the possibility that OCT2 might be involved in transmembrane transport of monoamines, especially dopamine. Although the pharmacological properties of OCT2 are characteristic of apical renal transport of organic cations, the tissue distribution indicates that the role of OCT2 might go beyond renal secretion of organic cations. RT-PCR reveals that the OCT2r mRNA exists not only in the kidney but is also transcribed in specific brain regions that are especially rich in the monoamine transmitter dopamine such as the nucleus accumbens, striatum, and substantia nigra (5Gründemann D. Babin-Ebell J. Martel F. Örding N. Schmidt A. Schömig E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10408-10413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Moreover, OCT2 is sensitive to corticosterone as well as to the iso- and pseudoisocyanines which represent a novel group of potent inhibitors of extraneuronal monoamine transport (5Gründemann D. Babin-Ebell J. Martel F. Örding N. Schmidt A. Schömig E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10408-10413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It should, however, be noted that, despite the evidence of a close relationship, OCT2 and the extraneuronal monoamine transporter are not identical. It is possible to distinguish these transport systems pharmacologically withO-methylisoprenaline. O-methylisoprenaline inhibits OCT2 about 500 times less potently than the extraneuronal monoamine transporter (5Gründemann D. Babin-Ebell J. Martel F. Örding N. Schmidt A. Schömig E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10408-10413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 21Schömig E. Schönfeld C.-L. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1990; 341: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The present study was designed to clarify whether OCT2 transports dopamine and other monoamine transmitters. To exclude transport-kinetic artifacts known to occur with isolated organs and to minimize the influence of other transport mechanisms that might contribute to monoamine transport, a cell line was created on the basis of human embryonic kidney cells (293 cells) that stably expresses OCT2r (293OCT2r cells). The success of transfection was documented by RT-PCR and functional testing. For control purposes, 293 cells were also transfected with the empty eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (293pcDNA3 cells). Stable transfection of 293 cells with OCT2r induced marked transport of dopamine and other biogenic amines such as 5-HT, noradrenaline, and adrenaline. Initial rates of dopamine transport, mediated by OCT2r, were saturable and sensitive to known inhibitors of the apical renal transport mechanism for organic cations such as decynium22, disprocynium24, and corticosterone (4Schömig E. Babin-Ebell J. Russ H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1993; 347: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 5Gründemann D. Babin-Ebell J. Martel F. Örding N. Schmidt A. Schömig E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10408-10413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Cocaine (1 μmol/liter),O-methylisoprenaline (30 μmol/liter), and reserpine (30 nmol/liter), on the other hand, failed to affect dopamine transport by OCT2r significantly. Cocaine is a known inhibitor of the neuronal dopamine transporter (DAT), the K i being about 0.1 μmol/liter (22Giros B. el-Mestikawy S. Godinot N. Zheng K. Han H. Yang-Feng T. Caron M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 383-390PubMed Google Scholar). O-Methylisoprenaline inhibits the extraneuronal monoamine transporter with a K i of 1.5 μmol/liter (21Schömig E. Schönfeld C.-L. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1990; 341: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and reserpine the vesicular monoamine transporters with a K i of 1 nmol/liter (23Parti R. Ozkan E. Harnadek G. Njus D. J. Neurochem. 1987; 48: 949-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate that OCT2 has the capability of transporting dopamine and other monoamine transmitters and, hence, open the possibility of OCT2 being involved in dopamine handling in both the kidney and the central nervous system. Recent evidence from in vivo experiments supports the hypothesis that OCT2 plays a role in renal dopamine handling. In the anesthetized rabbit, intravenous treatment with disprocynium24 grossly reduces tubular secretion of dopamine (24Graefe K. Friedgen B. Wàlfel R. Bossle F. Russ H. Schömig E. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1997; 356: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Renal proximal and distal tubule cells express the dopamine-synthesizing enzymel-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (25Goldstein M. Fuxe K. Hökfelt T. Pharmacol. Rev. 1972; 24: 293-309PubMed Google Scholar), and proximal tubule cells are known to form and secrete substantial amounts of dopamine (26Hagege J. Richet G. Kidney Int. 1985; 27: 3-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support the concept that dopamine acts as an intrarenal natriuretic hormone, possibly through an indirect modulation of the sodium/potassium-ATPase activity in tubular cells (27Aperia A. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertension. 1994; 3: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Disprocynium24 belongs to the new group of potent inhibitors of OCT2 and the related extraneuronal monoamine transporter (4Schömig E. Babin-Ebell J. Russ H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1993; 347: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Russ H. Engel W. Schömig E. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 4208-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is, in fact, the most potent inhibitor of OCT2 reported so far. TheK i for the inhibition of OCT2r has been shown to be as low as 2.4 nmol/liter (5Gründemann D. Babin-Ebell J. Martel F. Örding N. Schmidt A. Schömig E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10408-10413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This figure fits in with the present results that reveal a K i of 5.1 nmol/liter of disprocynium24 for the inhibition of dopamine transport by OCT2. Interestingly enough, disprocynium24 does not only block tubular secretion of dopamine but induces marked spill-over of renal dopamine into the systemic circulation (24Graefe K. Friedgen B. Wàlfel R. Bossle F. Russ H. Schömig E. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1997; 356: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This finding is compatible with the concept that dopamine from proximal tubule cells is normally secreted by OCT2 through the apical plasma membrane into the lumen of the tubule. When OCT2 is blocked, intracellular dopamine rises and significant spill-over into the peritubular fluid and, subsequently, systemic circulation occurs. The localization of the OCT2r mRNA in the kidney fits in with this concept. Our results indicate that high levels of the OCT2r mRNA exists in proximal tubule cells of the S3 segment. Expression of OCT2h, a human homologue of OCT2r, has been reported in the apical plasma membrane of distal tubule cells. But there is also evidence for OCT2h to exist in proximal tubule cells (7Gorboulev V. Ulzheimer J. Akhoundova A. Ulzheimer-Teuber I. Karbach U. Quester S. Baumann C. Lang F. Busch A. Koepsell H. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). There is ample evidence that renal dopamine is involved in the regulation of sodium excretion (27Aperia A. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertension. 1994; 3: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and, surprisingly enough, in the anaesthetized rat, disprocynium24 does not only block dopamine excretion but acts as a high ceiling eukaliuric diuretic and natriuretic (28Mühlbauer B. Luippold G. Vallon V. Spitzenberger F. Russ H. Osswald H. Schömig E. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1997; 356: 846-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism of this new pharmacological effect of disprocynium24 has not yet been clarified. An indirect activation of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, however, does not seem to be involved since pretreatment with the dopamine receptor blockers SCH23390 and S(−)-sulpiride fails to affect the diuretic action of disprocynium24 (28Mühlbauer B. Luippold G. Vallon V. Spitzenberger F. Russ H. Osswald H. Schömig E. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1997; 356: 846-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The recently cloned apical renal transport systems for organic cations OCT2 exists in proximal tubule cells and in dopamine-rich brain areas. For the first time, a cell line that stably expresses OCT2 has been created (293OCT2r cells) and used to analyze the substrate specificity with special emphasis on monoamine transmitters. The finding that OCT2 accepts dopamine as a substrate opens the possibility that this transporter is involved in dopaminergic signal transduction. Together with recently published in vivo data, the findings at hand suggest that OCT2 plays an important role in renal dopamine handling and might be involved in the potent eukaliuric diuretic action of disprocynium24.

Hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 1HNF4 and HNF1 exist as multiple isoforms. In this paper we are referring to the α isoform of each protein. (HNF4),2 a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is primarily expressed in liver, gut, kidney, and pancreas (1Sladek F.M. Tronche F. Yaniv M. Liver Gene Expression. 11. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1994: 207-223Google Scholar). Fatty acyl-CoA thioesters have recently been identified as ligands of HNF4 (2Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), a finding of considerable interest in view of the critical role HNF4 plays in the expression of genes important in a number of metabolic pathways (1Sladek F.M. Tronche F. Yaniv M. Liver Gene Expression. 11. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1994: 207-223Google Scholar). For example, HNF4 serves as an accessory factor for the glucocorticoid-mediated induction of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene and is necessary for the glucose-mediated increase of liver-type pyruvate kinase gene transcription (3Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23235-23238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 4Liu Z. Towle H.C. Biochem.

HNF4 also plays an essential role in embryonic development. Disruption of the HNF4 gene in mice results in an embryonic lethal phenotype characterized by a failure of the visceral endoderm to differentiate (6Chen W.S. Manova K. Weinstein D.C. Duncan S.A. Plump A.S. Prezioso V.R. Bachvarova R.F. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2466-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HNF4 plays a critical role in the regulation of several liver genes. It also stimulates the expression of another liver-enriched transcription factor, HNF1, which itself is required for the expression of several liver genes (7Kuo C.J. Conley P.B. Chen L. Sladek F.M.

Maturity onset diabetes of young (MODY) is a rare form of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) characterized by defective secretion of insulin. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Mutations of the HNF4 and HNF1 genes are directly associated with MODY types 1 and 3, respectively (9Yamagata K. Oda N. Kaisaki P.J. Menzel S.

Thus, through their effects in liver and beta cells, HNF4 and HNF1 have central roles in glucose homeostasis. In this study we tested whether the transcriptional activity of HNF4 requires an interaction with a coregulator molecule. HNF4 contains two transactivation domains, designated AF-1 and AF-2. AF-1 is located in the first 24 amino acids of the N-terminal region of the protein, whereas AF-2 extends from amino acids 128 to 370 (12Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kistanova E. Evagelopoulou C. Zeng S.

Several coactivators, including CBP/p300, SRC-1, and members of the SRC-1-related family such as GRIP1/TIF2 or ACTR/RAC3/P/CIP interact with the AF-2 domains of other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily and augment their transactivation potential (13Kamei Y.

Miyagishi M. Takiguchi M. Osumu T. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 664-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We show that SRC-1 and GRIP1 directly associate with the AF-2 domain of HNF4 in vivo and that these coactivators potentiate the transcriptional activity of HNF4. Furthermore, overexpression of SRC-1 or GRIP1 in HepG2 hepatoma cells enhances HNF1 gene expression, and this effect is dependent on the presence of an HNF4-binding site in the promoter. We propose that HNF4-coactivator interactions play a critical role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and thus could be of importance in the pathophysiology of NIDDM. The expression plasmids that encode the GAL4 DNA-binding domain-HNF4 fusion proteins were generated by subcloning PCR-amplified DNA fragments into the simian virus 40 (SV40) promoter-enhancer-driven GAL4 expression plasmid, pSG424 (22Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The HNF4 cDNA was provided by Dr. Frances Sladek (University of California at Riverside). Briefly, the nucleotide sequences of rat HNF4 corresponding to amino acids 1–374, 1–360, and 128–374 were amplified by the PCR, so that the fragments contained BamHI and KpnI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. These distinct PCR fragments were then digested and subcloned into theBamHI-KpnI site of pSG424. The reporter plasmid (GAL4)5E1bLuc was provided by Dr. Kazuya Yamada (Fukui Medical University, Japan) and was constructed by taking theBamHI/XhoI fragment from (GAL4)5E1bCAT (23Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), making it blunt-ended using the Klenow reaction, and subcloning this into the SmaI site of the pGL3 vector. The expression plasmids that encode p300 and GRIP1 have been previously described (24Ding X.F. Anderson C.M. Ma H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar) and were obtained from Dr. David Livingston (Dana Farber Institute, Boston) and Dr. Michael Stallcup (University of Southern California, Los Angeles), respectively. The SRC-1 expression plasmid was provided by Dr. Ming-Jer Tsai (Baylor Collage of Medicine). The HNF1 gene promoter reporter plasmids were provided by Dr. Naoyuki Miura (Akita University, Japan) and have been previously described (8Miura N. Tanaka K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3731-3736Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The yeast expression plasmids encoding the GAL4-HNF4 chimeric proteins (called pGBT9-HNF4(128–374) and pGBT9-HNF4(128–360)) were generated by the subcloning of EcoRI-BamHI PCR-amplified DNA fragments into the pGBT9 plasmid (CLONTECH). The yeast expression vectors that encode fusion proteins of the GAL4 AD and full-length GRIP1 and SRC-1 (called pGAD424 GRIP1/FL and pGAD424 SRC-1) were described previously (24Ding X.F. Anderson C.M. Ma H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transient transfection and maintenance of HepG2 and HeLa cells have been described previously (24Ding X.F. Anderson C.M. Ma H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was measured by the dual luciferase kit (Promega). Protein-protein interaction assays were performed using the Matchmaker yeast two-hybrid system (CLONTECH). A yeast plasmid, pGBT9-HNF4(128–374) or pGBT9-HNF4(128–360), was transformed into the yeast strain SFY526, and transformants were selected on synthetic dropout medium lacking Trp. Yeast plasmids, pGAD424 GRIP1/FL and pGAD424 SRC-1, were then transformed into the yeast strain SFY526 that contained either pGBT9-HNF4(128–374) or pGBT9-HNF4(128–360). The transformants were selected on synthetic dropout medium lacking Leu and Trp. The colonies that grew in these selection media were subjected to colony filter assays, as described in the technical manual of the Matchmaker yeast two-hybrid system (CLONTECH). The GAL4 system, previously used to identify the transactivation domains of HNF4 (12Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kistanova E. Evagelopoulou C. Zeng S. Cladaras C. Ladias J.A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), was used to determine whether SRC-1 and GRIP1 function as coactivators with HNF4. Expression plasmids that encode either SRC-1 or GRIP1 were cotransfected into HepG2 hepatoma cells with plasmids that encode the GAL4-HNF4 fusion proteins described under “Experimental Procedures” and with a reporter gene, (GAL4)5E1bLuc, that contains five copies of the GAL4-binding site. The activity of each GAL4-HNF4 chimeric protein was measured relative to that of the GAL4-DBD. Overexpression of SRC-1 and GRIP1 did not augment the transcriptional activity provided by GAL4-DBD in this system (Fig. 1, A and B). As noted previously, GAL4-HNF4(1–374) and GAL4-HNF4(128–374) both possess a strong transactivation function, whereas GAL4-HNF4(1–360), because of the absence of the AF-2 domain, is a weaker transactivator (Fig. 1 A and Ref. 12Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kistanova E. Evagelopoulou C. Zeng S. Cladaras C. Ladias J.A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of GAL4-HNF4(1–374), which contains both the AF-1 and AF-2 activation domains but lacks the C-terminal repression domain, is increased about 3-fold by overexpression of SRC-1 (Fig. 1 A). The transcriptional activity of GAL4-HNF4(128–374), which contains only the AF-2 activation domain, was also augmented about 3-fold by overexpression of SRC-1 (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, the transcriptional activity of GAL4-HNF4(1–360), which contains the AF-1 domain but lacks the AF-2 domain, was not influenced by the overexpression of SRC-1 (Fig. 1 A). Overexpression of GRIP1 also increased the transcriptional activity of GAL4-HNF4(1–374) and GAL4-HNF4(128–374) but had no effect on that of GAL4-HNF4(1–360) (Fig. 1 A). The effect of SRC-1 is consistently greater than that of GRIP-1, although significantly so only in the case of GAL4-HNF4(1–374). These results show that both SRC-1 and GRIP1 can act as coactivators with HNF4 and that these effects are dependent on the presence of the AF-2 domain in HNF4. We next tested the ability of SRC-1 and GRIP1 to potentiate the transcriptional activities of these three GAL4-HNF4 fusion proteins in HeLa cells to determine whether this phenomenon is cell type-specific. SRC-1 and GRIP1 both increased the transactivation function of GAL4-HNF4(1–374) and GAL4-HNF4(128–374) but had no effect on that of GAL4-HNF4(1–360) (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the effect of SRC-1 and GRIP1 on the transcriptional activity of HNF4 is not cell type-specific. SRC-1 was again a more potent coactivator than GRIP-1. These differences could be because of the different expression levels of these two coactivators in the cells or could reflect a difference in the strength of the interactions. The yeast two-hybrid assay was used to test for an in vivointeraction between HNF4 and either SRC-1 or GRIP1. The expression of the GAL4-HNF4(128–374) or the GAL4-HNF4(128–360) fusion proteins in yeast cells failed to activate reporter gene activity (β-galactosidase, data not shown). Thus, neither of these chimeric proteins possesses transcriptional activity in yeast. β-Galactosidase activity was also not observed when a plasmid (pGAD424) that encodes the GAL4 AD was coexpressed with either of the GAL4-HNF4 fusion proteins (data not shown). However, β-galactosidase activity was strongly induced when a chimeric protein that contained the GAL4 AD and SRC-1 or GRIP1 was coexpressed with GAL4-HNF4(128–374) (Fig. 2). In colony filter assays, yeast that contained the GAL4 AD and SRC-1 fusion protein and GAL4-HNF4(128–374) turned blue 30 min after initiation of the reaction (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, yeast that contained the GAL4 AD-GRIP1 fusion protein and GAL4-HNF4(128–374) turned blue 4 h after initiation of the assay (Fig. 2 B). Thus, the interaction between SRC-1 and HNF4 is stronger than between GRIP1 and HNF4. Coexpression of the GAL4 AD-SRC-1 or GAL4 AD-GRIP1 fusion proteins with GAL4-HNF4(128–360) did not induce β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 2,C and D). These results suggest that SRC-1 and GRIP1 both interact with HNF4 and that these interactions are dependent on the presence of the AF-2 domain of HNF4. These results are consonant with the functional results shown in Fig. 1. CBP is known to associate with HNF4, and it potentiates the activity of a reporter construct that contains multiple HNF4-binding sites (21Yoshida E. Aratani S. Itou H. Miyagishi M. Takiguchi M. Osumu T. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 664-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether p300, another member of the CBP coactivator family, potentiates the transcriptional activity of GAL4-HNF4 chimeric proteins. Overexpression of p300 in HeLa cells does enhance the activity of GAL4-HNF4(128–374) but not that of GAL4-HNF4(1–360) (Fig. 3). Thus, coactivation of HNF4 by p300 also requires an intact AF-2 domain. The transcriptional activity of GAL4-HNF4(128–374) was further enhanced when both p300 and SRC-1 were overexpressed in HeLa cells (Fig. 3), as has been reported in the analysis of other nuclear receptors (20Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 28Smith C.L. Onate S.A. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8884-8888Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). HNF4 binds to its cognate DNA element in the HNF1 gene promoter and enhances transcription through this interaction (7Kuo C.J. Conley P.B. Chen L. Sladek F.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 8Miura N. Tanaka K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3731-3736Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The coexpression of SRC-1 or GRIP1 should enhance expression from the HNF1 promoter if the HNF4-coregulator interaction is functionally important. In fact, the overexpression of SRC-1 in HepG2 hepatoma cells increased HNF1 gene promoter activity by about 3-fold (Fig. 4). Overexpression of GRIP1 was slightly less effective (Fig. 4). Deletion of the HNF4-binding site in the HNF1 promoter (HNF4ΔA) resulted in a 90% reduction of expression, as expected (8Miura N. Tanaka K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3731-3736Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the overexpression of either SRC-1 or GRIP1 was without effect when a construct containing this element was used as the promoter in the reporter system (Fig. 4). The transcription factor HNF4, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is important for tissue-specific gene expression, including several genes involved in hepatic glucose metabolism (1Sladek F.M. Tronche F. Yaniv M. Liver Gene Expression. 11. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1994: 207-223Google Scholar). We now show that both SRC-1 and GRIP1 interact with HNF4 (Fig. 2) and potentiate its transcriptional activity (Fig. 1). Both are presumably active in vivo, and given the high degree of homology between SRC-1, GRIP1, and other SRC-1-related coactivators such as RAC3, ACTR, and P/CIP, it is possible that these proteins can also function as coactivators for HNF4. It is not known why most tissues express all these coactivators, but they could have selective actions. For example, SRC-1 has been implicated in the action of androgens. The expression of GRIP1 is increased about 2-fold in knockout mice that lack the SRC-1 gene, apparently in compensation for the loss of SRC-1, but these mice still display a partial resistance to the action of androgens (29Xu J. Qiu Y. DeMayo F.J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1922-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). These coactivators are thus not completely interchangeable. It is possible that specific coactivators, or different ratios of various of these proteins in cells, result in selective interaction with nuclear receptors, including HNF4. CBP/p300 serves as a coactivator with most members of the nuclear hormone receptor family (13Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K.

This coactivation effect is dependent on an intact AF-2 domain, which is also required for the interaction of SRC-1 and GRIP1 with HNF4. In addition, p300 acts synergistically with SRC-1 or GRIP1 to further enhance the transcriptional activity of HNF4. A similar phenomenon has been observed with other nuclear receptors (20Torchia J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8884-8888Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that transactivation by nuclear receptors requires the formation of a complex with coactivators (32Jenster G. Spencer T.E. Burcin M.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7879-7884Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 33Kurokawa R. Kalafus D. Ogliastro M.-H. Kioussi C. Xu L. Torchia J. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K.

These coactivator complexes can contain SRC-1/GRIP1, p300/CBP, and other coactivators such as P/CAF (34Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin.

Nature. 1997; 389: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). The histone acetylase activity of P/CAF is required for the retinoic acid-mediated induction of gene transcription (34Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 40Korzus E. Torchia J. Rose D.W. Xu L. Kurokawa R. McInerney E.M. Mullen T.-M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1998; 279: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). A two-step model that first requires chromatin remodeling by histone acetylation and then an interaction with the general transcription apparatus has been proposed to explain how this coactivator complex mediates the transactivation of nuclear receptors (32Jenster G. Spencer T.E. Burcin M.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7879-7884Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). It is possible that a similar mechanism is required for the action of HNF4, which serves as an accessory factor in the glucocorticoid response unit of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene (5Hall R.K. Sladek F.M. Granner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). HNF4 appears to have a pleiotropic effect on the regulation of glucose homeostasis. The mechanism of HNF4 gene mutations in the pathophysiology of MODY (type 1) has not been established, but it is of interest to note that HNF4 is required for expression of HNF1, another MODY gene (type 3) (7Kuo C.J.

Nature. 1996; 384: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Indeed, at least one MODY pedigree is because of a mutation of the HNF4-binding site in the HNF1 gene promoter. The common denominator of MODY type 1 and 3 may be the loss of HNF1 gene function. In this regard, it may be noteworthy that we found that overexpression of both SRC-1 and GRIP1 increases the activity of the HNF1 gene promoter, and a mutation of the HNF4 DNA-binding site in this promoter disrupts this effect. In addition to its apparent role in insulin secretion (10Yamagata K. Furuta H. Oda N. Kaisaki P.J. Menzel S. Cox N.J. Fajans S.S. Signorini S. Stoffel M. Bell G.I. Nature. 1996; 384: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar) and a demonstrated role in the regulation of hepatic gene expression (1Sladek F.M. Tronche F. Yaniv M. Liver Gene Expression. 11. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1994: 207-223Google Scholar), HNF4 also regulates the expression of other genes (e.g.glucose transporter 2 (Glut 2), aldolase B, and pyruvate kinase that are involved in glucose transport and glucose metabolism in embryonic stem cells and in embryos (41Stoffel M. Duncan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13209-13214Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar)). The observation that fatty acyl-CoA thioesters are HNF4 ligands (2Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) provides support for the connection between HNF4 and glucose homeostasis because fatty acids affect the regulation of glucose metabolism by decreasing peripheral glucose utilization, increasing hepatic gluconeogenesis, and influencing insulin secretion and pancreatic β cell hyperplasia (42Boden G. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 43Newgard C.B. McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 689-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 44Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 863-870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ligands affect the binding of nuclear receptors to target DNA sequences but also influence the interactions of these receptors with coactivators or corepressors (34Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G.

The inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase by nitric oxide (NO) may play a normal role in controlling mitochondrial O2consumption (1Brown G.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 136-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Inhibition of cytochrome oxidase by NO could, for example, explain the observation that the apparentK m for O2 of whole cells is greater than that of isolated mitochondria (2Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). The inhibition of cytochrome oxidase by elevated levels of NO, although readily reversible, can have profound consequence for the cell in pathophysiological disease states (3Cleeter M.W.J.

Inhibition of the mitochondrial transport chain at the cytochrome oxidase level can produce superoxide (O2−) from O2. Peroxynitrite (ONOO−)1 can be formed by the reaction of NO and O2−. Thus, inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase by NO can lead to the formation of both NO and O2− and thereby lead to the formation of ONOO− (4Packer M.A. Porteous C.M. Murphy M.P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 40: 527-534PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to this mechanism, ONOO− can also arise via the reaction of nitroxyl anion (NO−) and O2 (5Hogg N. Singh R.J. Kalyanaraman B.

J. 1998; 332: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).In contrast to NO, ONOO− can irreversibly damage many of the mitochondrial enzymes and complexes of oxidative phosphorylation, including aconitase, NADH/co-Q reductase, quinol/cytochromec reductase, succinate dehydrogenase, and the ATP synthetase (8Hausladen A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29405-29408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Radi R. Rodriguez M. Castro L. Telleri R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The consequent collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) can trigger the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). This causes the release of cytochrome c from the intra-mitochondrial space into the cytoplasm (10Liu X.S. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X.D. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4435) Google Scholar, 11Yang J. Liu X.S. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J.Y. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X.D.

Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar). The movement of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm consequently triggers apoptotic cell death (13Kroemer G. Zanzami N. Susin S.A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 44-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). As ONOO− has been shown to induce the MPT (14Packer M.A. Murphy M.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 15Schweizer M. Richter C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4524-4528Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the formation of ONOO− from NO may thus be responsible for a pro-apoptotic role of NO.Reversible inhibition of cytochrome oxidase by NO may therefore initiate a cascade of events that results in cell death. However, there is conflicting evidence as to whether ONOO− directly inhibits cytochrome oxidase function in cells and mitochondria, with some papers suggesting that there is little or no damage (9Radi R. Rodriguez M. Castro L. Telleri R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 16Cassina A. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) and others disagreeing (17Bolanos J.P. Heales S.J.R. Land J.M. Clark J.B. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1965-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Here we resolve this controversy by clearly demonstrating that purified cytochrome oxidase when solubilized or in proteoliposomal form is irreversibly damaged by ONOO−. Interestingly, we also observe that cytochrome oxidase catalyzes NO production from ONOO−; this novel chemistry, converting an irreversible inhibitor into a reversible one, may play a role in ONOO− detoxification by the mitochondria.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBovine heart cytochrome c oxidase was purified according to the method of Kuboyama et al. (18Kuboyama M. Yong F.C. King T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6375-6383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), substituting Tween 80 for Emasol in the latter stages of the purification. Peroxynitrite (ONOO−) was prepared from amyl nitrite and hydrogen peroxide using the method of Uppu and Pryor (19Uppu R.M. Pryor W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 322-329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); 26 ml of amyl nitrite (washed three times with water) was added to 100 ml of 2 m H2O2, 2 mNaOH, and 2 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), 4 °C. This solution was stirred vigorously for 3 h at 4 °C. The lower aqueous layer was removed from the organic phase using a separating funnel and washed three times with an equal volume of ice-cold hexane. To remove residual H2O2, 10 g of manganese dioxide was gradually added to the ONOO− solution while it was being stirred, on ice, for approximately 1 h. The ONOO− solution was filtered and then stored at 77 K. After thawing, the ONOO−solutions were passed down a 6 × 1-cm MnO2 column equilibrated with 0.1 m NaOH to remove any traces of H2O2. The ONOO− was then diluted with 0.1 m NaOH to approximately 30 mmimmediately before use. The concentration of ONOO− was determined spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficient of 1670 m−1 cm−1 at 302 nm. Nitrite contamination of the ONOO− solution was determined to be approximately one third of the ONOO− concentration, as in (19Uppu R.M. Pryor W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 322-329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of catalase to decomposed peroxynitrite at pH 7 resulted in no oxygen evolution, consistent with an absence of any H2O2 contamination in the solution.Crude NO was prepared by the addition of 2 mH2SO4 to solid NaNO2 in a Kipps apparatus. The NO gas was purified by passage through four NaOH (20%) traps and then through a dry ice trap, to remove NO2. NO solutions were prepared by the addition of purified NO gas into buffer solutions that had undergone four vacuum/N2 deoxygenation cycles. The concentration of the NO solution varied between 1.2 and 2 mm. The nitrite concentration in the NO solution was determined to be between 300 and 500 μm.The concentrations of O2 and NO were determined polarographically. A Perspex, water-jacketed O2 electrode (Rank Brothers, Bottisham, Cambridge, U.K.) was modified to allow the insertion of a WPI ISO-200 NO electrode (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). The NO electrode was connected to an ISO-NO II NO meter. Data from the O2 and the NO electrodes were collected using MacLab data collection and analysis system (ADI Instruments, Castle Hill, New South Wales, Australia). Nitrite concentrations were determined by the addition of aliquots of the solution to 100 mm KI, 100 mm H2SO4followed by measurement of the NO produced using the electrode (this procedure yields a 1:1 nitrite:NO stoichiometry).Cytochrome c oxidase turnover was assayed by adding 5 nm cytochrome oxidase to 20 mm sodium ascorbate, 300 μm N,N,N′,N′-tetremethyl-p-phenylenediamine hydrochloride (TMPD), 60 μm cytochrome c(horse heart, Sigma type C-7752) in 5 ml of 100 mmK+-Hepes or 100 mm K+-phosphate, 20 μm DTPA, 0.015% lauryl maltoside, pH 7.0, 30 °C.In the derived plots (Fig. 4), the non-enzymatic autoxidation rate was subtracted from the overall O2 consumption rate to give the enzymatic rate. We found that the autoxidation rate of ascorbate was directly proportional to the O2 concentration. We calculated the autoxidation rate for ascorbate at all O2concentrations and subtracted this from the O2 consumption rate.Figure 4Comparison of peroxynitrite and NO on the turnover of cytochrome oxidase. The effect of O2concentration on the turnover of cytochrome oxidase is shown in A. From this, it can be seen that the K mfor O2 is below 2 μm. In B, NO was added to a final concentration of approximately 750 nm at an O2 concentration of 180 μm. Following the disappearance of the NO the cytochrome turnover almost returns to the level before the addition of NO. The K m for O2 is again <2 μm. C shows the addition of 100 μm ONOO− to cytochrome oxidase. This releases 750 nm NO. Following the decay of NO, cytochrome oxidase turnover drops by approximately 50% and theK m for O2 is increased to approximately 20 μm. Conditions were as in Fig. 1. D shows the irreversible effect of ONOO− concentration on theK m for O2, measured using a Oroboros® Oxygraph high resolution respirometer. The line is the best fit linear regression forced to cross thevertical axis at 0.9 μmO2 (the K m for O2 in the absence of ONOO−).

The experimental conditions were as in Fig. 1, but with a smaller chamber volume, 3.4 ml.Figure 1Effect of 100 μmONOO− on the oxygen consumption of cytochrome oxidase and the NO concentration. A, effect of 100 μm ONOO− on the O2 consumption of cytochrome c oxidase and on NO concentration detected simultaneously by O2 and NO electrodes. Following the addition of ONOO−, approximately 750 nm NO was generated (bottom trace), causing inhibition of the oxidase. B, generation of NO from ONOO− by cytochrome c oxidase under anaerobic conditions. ONOO− was added to an anaerobic solution of cytochromec. Conditions: 5 ml, 100 mmK+-Hepes, 0.015% lauryl maltoside, 20 μmDTPA, pH 7.0, 30 °C, 300 μm TMPD, 60 μmcytochrome c, 20 mm ascorbate, and 5 nm oxidase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cytochrome c oxidase vesicles (COV) were prepared as described previously (21Sharpe M. Perin I. Wrigglesworth J. Nicholls P. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). 0.25 g of soybean phospholipid (Sigma type II-S “phosphatidyl choline”) and 0.1 g of sodium cholate were dispersed in 5 ml of 100 mm K+-Hepes, pH 7.0, by vortex mixer. The suspension was then sonicated on ice under a N2 stream for 8 min using a 30% duty cycle. Cytochrome oxidase was added to a final concentration of 6 μm and then sonicated for 30 s to disperse the oxidase. The mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g and 4 °C to remove undispersed lipid and titanium particles. The solution was then twice dialyzed against 100 volumes of buffer and once against 200 volumes of buffer, over 3 days at 4 °C. The COV were passed down a Sephadex G-25 column to remove lipid aggregates. The sidedness was determined by the percentage ascorbate-reducibility in the presence of externally added cytochrome c and cyanide (22Wrigglesworth J. Wooster M.S. Elsden J. Danneel H. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and was found to be approximately 80% externally facing cytochrome oxidase.Cytochrome c oxidase spectra were monitored in 100 mm K+-Hepes, 20 μm DTPA, 0.1% lauryl maltoside, pH 7.0. The change in the broad near-infrared band due to oxidized CuA was monitored at 830 nm, using the 722 and 900 nm wavepair as references, i.e. ΔCuA = ΔA 830 nm − (ΔA 722 nm + ΔA 900 nm)/2. Cytochrome a was monitored using the 605 minus 630 nm wavepair and an extinction coefficient of 23.5 mm−1 cm−1. The concentration of compound F was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 5.3 mm−1cm−1 for the 580 minus 630 nm wavepair; the contribution of cytochrome a reduction at this wavepair was corrected by using the relationship for a 2+ of (ΔA 605–630 nm)/(ΔA 580–630 nm) = 4.4.Steady state spectra (Fig. 8) were obtained as follows; 20 mm ascorbate was added to 10 μm cytochrome oxidase and 30 μm cytochrome c in K+-Hepes buffer. Following anaerobiosis, 10 nmcatalase and then 2 mm H2O2 was added to reoxygenate the solution. When steady state turnover was observed, an aliquot of ONOO− was added. The solution was allowed to become anaerobic again, and a few grains of dithionite were added to the solution to fully reduce the cytochrome oxidase. Enzyme inhibition following the addition of ONOO− was calculated from the change in the cytochrome c redox state. This is proportional to enzyme turnover under these conditions (23Nicholls P. van Buuren K.J.H. van Gelder B.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 275: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Figure 8Effect of peroxynitrite on cytochrome coxidase in the steady state. 10 μm cytochromec oxidase was incubated in 100 mmK+-phosphate, 20 μm DTPA, 0.015% lauryl maltoside, 30 μm cytochrome c, 30 °C. 300 μm TMPD and 20 mm ascorbate were than added, and the solution was allowed to become anaerobic. After ≈5 min of anaerobiosis, 1 nm catalase and 5 mmH2O2 were added. Once the solution came to steady state, aliquots of ONOO− were added.

Rodriguez M. Castro L. Telleri R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 16Cassina A. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows that this is not the case. Following the addition of 100 μm ONOO−to actively respiring cytochrome oxidase, a transient but complete inhibition of enzyme activity was observed. The onset of enzyme inhibition occurred simultaneously with the generation of NO. The addition of 100 μm ONOO− induced the generation of approximately 750 nm NO, a value far above the apparent K i for NO inhibition of cytochrome oxidase turnover at the O2 tension used. NO is metabolized by cytochrome oxidase (24Zhao X. Samphath V. Caughey W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 1054-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and its substrates (7Sharpe M. Cooper C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 25Kelm M.

Biophys. 1995; 322: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and as the NO was consumed the oxidase began to turn over again.However, unlike the inhibition of cytochrome oxidase by the addition of authentic NO (where enzyme turnover is fully restored following the decay of NO; Ref. 2Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar), cytochrome oxidase turnover following the addition of ONOO− was always less than the rate prior to its addition. This shows that, unlike the reversible inhibition of cytochrome oxidase by NO, ONOO− is an irreversible inhibitor (2Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 28Koivisto A. Matthias A. Bronnikov G. Nedergaard J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The production of NO from ONOO− by the enzyme was only marginally O2-sensitive. 100 μm ONOO− added to anaerobic 5 nmcytochrome c oxidase, in the presence of reductant, still induced the formation of approximately 500 nm NO (Fig. 1 B).Fig. 2 shows the effect of ONOO− concentration on the final cytochrome oxidase turnover (when all the NO generated has decayed away). It can be seen that 100 μm ONOO− caused a 50% drop in the turnover of the purified enzyme. This was a much greater drop in cytochrome oxidase activity than previously observed in both intact or sonicated mitochondria, even though in the experiments with mitochondria ONOO− concentrations as high as 2 mm were used (9Radi R. Rodriguez M. Castro L. Telleri R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar).Figure 2Cytochrome oxidase turnover as a function of peroxynitrite concentration.

The error bars represent ±1 standard deviation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3 quantifies the amount of NO production as a function of the added ONOO− concentration. Both in the presence and absence of O2, NO production was proportional to the added ONOO− concentration. NO was not produced from ONOO− that had been allowed to decompose at neutral pH prior to addition. The formation of NO from peroxynitrite was inhibited by cyanide (20 mm). Addition of azide (10 mm) gave very similar results to those observed with cyanide. This suggests that the binuclear hemea 3/CuB center is the site of NO formation in cytochrome oxidase.Figure 3Nitric oxide production by cytochrome oxidase as a function of peroxynitrite concentration. The effect of ONOO− concentration on NO produced: aerobically in the presence of 5 nm oxidase (♦), anaerobically in the presence of 5 nm oxidase (▪), aerobically in the absence of oxidase (■), and aerobically in the presence of oxidase and 20 mm NaCN (▵). Each point is the average of three experiments. The error bars represent ±1 standard deviation. Other conditions are as described for Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Under these conditions, a small rate of NO production was seen even in the absence of the enzyme; this appears to be a reaction between peroxynitrite and ascorbate, as it did not occur when ascorbate was left out of the solution, nor did it occur if nitrite were added instead of peroxynitrite. Under certain conditions, NO donors can be formed from the addition of ONOO− to primary alcohols (29Moro M.A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Lizasoain I. Su Y.L. Knowles R.G. Radomski M.W. Moncada S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar,30Zhu L. Gunn C. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) such as Hepes. However, we found that there was no difference in the amount of NO produced following the addition of ONOO−to cytochrome oxidase in phosphate buffer or in Hepes buffer, ruling this out as a significant mechanism of NO production in this system.NO is a reversible inhibitor of cytochrome oxidase (2Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 28Koivisto A. Matthias A. Bronnikov G. Nedergaard J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, following ONOO− treatment, we observed an irreversible inhibition of enzyme turnover by as much as 50% (Figs. 1 Aand 2). The difference between the long term effects of NO and ONOO− on cytochrome oxidase activity can be clearly seen in Fig. 4, where we compared treatment with the same concentration of “authentic NO” (750 nm) as that formed following the addition of 100 μmONOO− to the enzyme. In a control trace, in the absence of NO or ONOO−, we see that oxidase turnover is insensitive to O2 concentration until this drops below 10 μm (Fig. 4 A). Following the addition of 750 nm NO, added at 180 μm O2 (Fig. 4 B), the enzyme was strongly inhibited until the NO concentration dropped below 300 nm. Following the complete removal of NO from the solution, the enzyme returned to its pre-inhibited rate. Addition of 100 μm ONOO−to cytochrome oxidase under steady state turnover conditions caused the release of approximately 750 nm NO. The oxidase was inhibited until almost all the NO had left the solution (Fig. 4 C). However, after all the NO had gone, the final rate was still approximately half the initial rate and the enzymes sensitivity to O2 concentration was increased. ONOO−treatment decreased the V max and significantly raised the K m for O2. Independent measurements in a dedicated high resolution respirometer demonstrate that under these conditions the K m for O2 in the control was 0.9 μm. After the addition of 100 μm ONOO−, theK m had risen to 14 μm (Fig. 4 D).One possible explanation for the lowering of theV max and the raising of theK m for O2 was that we were observing an artifact due to a slow degradation of the cytochrome oxidase throughout the time course of the experiment. We tested this hypothesis by allowing an oxidase solution that had been treated with ONOO− to become anaerobic. Following re-aeration 10 min later, the cytochrome oxidase turnover was found to have the same (inhibited) V max and K m for O2 as before. This indicates that there is no continuous degradation of cytochrome oxidase following the addition of ONOO− during the time course of the experiment,i.e. the damage occurred immediately following ONOO− addition.The ability of ONOO− to decrease theV max of purified cytochrome oxidase is consistent with reports that ONOO− inhibits cytochrome oxidase activity in astrocyte cultures, macrophages (31Szabo C. Day B.J. Salzman A.L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and in rat brain mitochondria (32Lizasoain I. Moro M.A. Knowles R.G. Darley-Usmar V.M. Moncada S.

On the other hand, PU.1 transcripts were never detected in any tissue of AML1(-/-) or PEBP2beta/CBFbeta(-/-) embryos. In addition, transcripts for the Vav, flk-2/flt-3, M-CSF receptor, G-CSF receptor and c-Myb genes were not detected in certain tissues of the (-/-) embryos.

https://openalex.org/W1963705072,"We have reported JAK-signaling modulators, CIS1 (cytokine-inducible SH2 protein-1), CIS3 and JAB (JAK2 binding protein), which are structurally related. In M1 myeloid leukemia cells, CIS3 was induced by neither interleukin 6 (IL6) nor interferon gamma (IFNgamma), while JAB was induced strongly by IFNgamma and slightly by IL6 and leukemia inhibitory factor (ILF). Forced expression of CIS3 and JAB in M1 cells prevented IL6- or LIF-induced growth arrest and differentiation, even when their expression levels were comparable to endogenous ones in several cell lines such as HEL, UT-7, IFNgamma-treated M1, and CTLL2 cells. Pretreatment of parental M1 cells with IFNgamma but not IFNbeta resulted in suppression of LIF-induced STAT3 activation and differentiation, further supporting that physiological level of JAB is sufficient to inhibit LIF-signaling. However, unlike JAB, CIS3 did not inhibit IFNgamma-induced growth arrest, suggesting a difference in cytokine specificity between CIS3 and JAB. CIS3 inhibited STAT3 activation with slower kinetics than JAB and allowed rapid c-fos induction and partial FcgammaRI expression in response to IL6. In 293 cells, CIS3 as well as JAB bound to JAK2 tyrosine kinase domain (JH1), and inhibited its kinase activity, however, the effect of CIS3 on tyrosine kinase activity was weaker than that of JAB, indicating that CIS3 possesses lower affinity to JAK kinases than JAB. These findings suggest that CIS3 is a weaker inhibitor than JAB against JAK signaling, and JAB and CIS3 possess different regulatory roles in cytokine signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2093605434,"A number of endothelium-derived relaxing factors have been identified including nitric oxide, prostacyclin, and the epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. Previous work showed that in rabbit aortic endothelial cells, arachidonic acid was metabolized by a lipoxygenase to vasodilatory eicosanoids. The identity was determined by the present study. Aortic homogenates were incubated in the presence of [U-14C]arachidonic acid, [U-14C]arachidonic acid plus 15-lipoxygenase (soybean lipoxidase), or [U-14C]15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HPETE) and analyzed by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Under both experimental conditions, there was a radioactive metabolite that migrated at 17.5–18.5 min on RP-HPLC. When the metabolite was isolated from aortic homogenates, it relaxed precontracted aortas in a concentration-dependent manner. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) of the derivatized metabolite indicated the presence of two products; 11,12,15-trihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (THETA) and 11,14,15-THETA. A variety of chemical modifications of the metabolite supported these structures and confirmed the presence of a carboxyl group, double bonds, and hydroxyl groups. With the combination of 15-lipoxygenase, arachidonic acid, and aortic homogenate, an additional major radioactive peak was observed. This fraction was analyzed by GC/MS. The mass spectrum was consistent with this peak, containing both the 11-hydroxy-14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (11-H-14,15-EETA) and 15-H-11,12-EETA. The hydroxyepoxyeicosatrienoic acid (HEETA) fraction also relaxed precontracted rabbit aorta. Microsomes derived from rabbit aortas also synthesized 11,12,15- and 11,14,15-THETAs from 15-HPETE, and pretreatment with the cyctochrome P450 inhibitor, miconazole, blocked the formation of these products. The present studies suggest that arachidonic acid is metabolized by 15-lipoxygenase to 15-HPETE, which undergoes an enzymatic rearrangement to 11-H-14,15-EETA and 15-H-11,12-EETA. Hydrolysis of the epoxy group results in the formation of 11,14,15- and 11,12,15-THETA, which relaxed rabbit aorta. Thus, the 15-series THETAs join prostacyclin, nitric oxide, and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids as new members of the family of endothelium-derived relaxing factors.

The vascular endothelium synthesizes and releases compounds that are involved in the regulation of vascular tone (1Furchgott R.F. Vanhoutte P.M. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2007-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). These endothelial-derived vasoactive compounds include prostacyclin, endothelium-derived relaxing factor or nitric oxide, endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, endothelium-derived contracting factor, and endothelin. These endothelial factors mediate the vasoactive effects of a number of hormones including acetylcholine, bradykinin, and ATP (1Furchgott R.F. Vanhoutte P.M. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2007-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). Alterations in the production of these compounds may be associated with cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, coronary vasospasm, and hypertension. Arachidonic acid is metabolized by the vascular endothelium to a variety of cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, and cytochrome P450 epoxygenase products (2Needleman P. Turk J. Jakschik B.A. Morrison A.R. Lefkowith J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 69-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The identity and biological activity of some of these arachidonic acid metabolites have been determined; however, many metabolites have not been well characterized, either structurally or biologically. Singer and Peach (3Singer H.A. Peach M.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1983; 226: 790-795PubMed Google Scholar) and DeMey et al. (4DeMey J.G. Claeys M. Vanhoutte P.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1982; 222: 166-173PubMed Google Scholar) first reported that arachidonic acid relaxed blood vessels and that arachidonic acid-induced relaxations were dependent on the presence of the endothelium (3Singer H.A. Peach M.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1983; 226: 790-795PubMed Google Scholar, 4DeMey J.G. Claeys M. Vanhoutte P.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1982; 222: 166-173PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pinto A.

Using inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism, Singer and Peach (6Singer H.A. Peach M.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1983; 226: 796-801PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that a lipoxygenase metabolite mediated the effect. We have recently reported the ability of arachidonic acid to release a noncyclooxygenase metabolite from endothelial cells, which relaxes rabbit vascular smooth muscle (7Pfister S.L. Campbell W.B. Hypertension. 1992; 20: 682-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This relaxing factor is an endothelium-derived, lipoxygenase metabolite of arachidonic acid (8Pfister S.L. Spitzbarth N. Edgemond W. Campbell W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1021-H1030PubMed Google Scholar). In isolated aorta, the partially purified factor elicits relaxation of precontracted vessels. Lipoxygenases are a family of enzymes that convert arachidonic acid into monohydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HPETEs)1 (9Pace-Asciak C.R. Asotra S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1989; 7: 409-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Lipoxygenases differ in their specificity for placing the hydroperoxy group in arachidonic acid. 12- and 15-lipoxygenase activity are present in the endothelium of the rabbit aorta (10Pfister S.L. Falck J.R. Campbell W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: H843-H852PubMed Google Scholar). The HPETEs are metabolized by peroxidases to the monohydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs). There is evidence that the HPETEs and to a lesser extent, the HETEs elicit vasorelaxation in certain vascular tissues (11Rosolowsky M. Falck J.R. Willerson J.T. Campbell W.B. Circ. Res. 1990; 66: 608-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 12d'Alarcao M. Corey F.H. Cunard C. Ramwell P. Votila P. Vargas R. Wroblewska B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 91: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 13Van Diest M.J. Verbeuren T.J. Herman A.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 256: 194-203PubMed Google Scholar). However, in rabbit aorta, 12- and 15-HETE are inactive (10Pfister S.L. Falck J.R. Campbell W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: H843-H852PubMed Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the HPETE must be metabolized to some product other than a HETE to cause vasodilation. In various tissues and cells, both 12- and 15-HPETEs can undergo additional transformations to leukotrienes, lipoxins, long chain aldehydes, trihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid, and hydroxyepoxyeicosatrienoic acids (14Pace-Asciak C.R. Granstrom E. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6835-6840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bryant R.W. Bailey J.M. Prog.

The hydroxyepoxyeicosatrienoic acids and trihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids of 12-lipoxygenase have been called hepoxilins and trioxilins, respectively (14Pace-Asciak C.R. Granstrom E. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6835-6840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hepoxilins have been shown to release insulin and enhance the vasoconstrictor effects of norepinephrine (14Pace-Asciak C.R. Granstrom E. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6835-6840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Laneuville O. Couture R. Pace-Asciak C.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 105: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). There is no information on the biological effects of the hydroxyepoxy and trihydroxy products derived from 15-lipoxygenase. Our previous studies (7Pfister S.L. Campbell W.B. Hypertension. 1992; 20: 682-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8Pfister S.L. Spitzbarth N. Edgemond W. Campbell W.B. Am. J.

Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) support the hypothesis that arachidonic acid is metabolized to a potentially important lipoxygenase product(s) involved in the regulation of vascular tone. The purpose of the present study was to chemically identify the biologically active lipoxygenase metabolite(s) synthesized from arachidonic acid by rabbit aorta. Norepinephrine, arachidonic acid, soybean lipoxidase (type I-B), and indomethacin were all from Sigma. [U-14C]Arachidonic acid (specific activity 920 mCi/mmol) and [1-14C]arachidonic acid (53 mCi/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. All solvents were high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade and purchased from Burdick and Jackson, Muskegan, MI. 15-Lipoxygenase standards were obtained by incubating with [U-14C]arachidonic acid (0.05 μCi, 10−5m) in buffer containing hematin (1 μm) and soybean lipoxidase (0.2 mg/ml) for 10 min at room temperature or chemically as described by Falck et al. (17Falck J.R. Manna S. Siddhanta A.K. Capdevila J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1983; 24: 5715-5718Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 15-HPETE was synthesized by incubating arachidonic acid (216 mg) in 400 ml of borate buffer, pH 9.0, with soybean lipoxidase under a stream of oxygen for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was acidified to pH 5 with 5% hydrochloric acid and extracted with diethyl ether. The combined extracts were washed with saturated NaCl, dried with MgSO4, filtered, and evaporated to dryness. The extract was purified by silica gel column chromatography using hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (2.5/10/0.25) at 4 °C. The yield was approximately 50%. A similar approach was used to synthesize [U-14C]15-HPETE. Aortas (either freshly isolated from 1–2 month old New Zealand White rabbits or purchased from Pel-Frez Biologicals, Rogers, AR) were obtained and cleaned of adhering connective tissue and fat. The vessels were rinsed in Tris buffer (0.05 m, pH 7.5) and then cut into small pieces. Vessel segments were homogenized (5 passes with a mechanical homogenizer) in fresh buffer (500 mg of tissue/10 ml of buffer). The homogenate was centrifuged at 750 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was used. Aliquots (5 mg/ml) of the supernatant were incubated for 20 min in Tris-HCl buffer containing indomethacin (10−5m) and [U-14C]arachidonic acid (0.05 μCi, 10−7m). In an additional study, aortic homogenates were incubated with [1-14C]arachidonic acid (0.05 μCi, 10−7m) instead of uniformly labeled arachidonic acid. In some incubations, 15-lipoxygenase (soybean lipoxidase, 0.2 mg/ml) was included. Alternatively, the homogenate was incubated with [U-14C]15-HPETE instead of [U-14C]arachidonic acid. For analysis of metabolites by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), aortic homogenates (50 mg/ml) were incubated with [U-14C]arachidonic acid (0.05 μCi, 5 × 10−5m) or arachidonic acid plus 15-lipoxygenase (0.2 mg/ml/incubation). All reactions were stopped by adding ethanol to a final concentration of 15%. The samples were acidified (pH < 3.5) and extracted using octadecylsilyl extraction columns as described previously (8Pfister S.L. Spitzbarth N. Edgemond W. Campbell W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1021-H1030PubMed Google Scholar). The extracted metabolites were evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen and stored at −40 °C until analysis by HPLC. The biological samples were first resolved by reverse phase (Nucleosil-C18 column, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) HPLC using solvent system I. Solvent A was water, and solvent B was acetonitrile containing 0.1% glacial acetic acid. The program was a 40-min linear gradient from 50% solvent B in A to 100% solvent B. Flow rate was 1 ml/min. The fractions corresponding to the unknown factor (fractions 27–35) were pooled, acidified, extracted with cyclohexane/ethyl acetate (50/50), and rechromatographed on reverse phase HPLC using solvent system II. In solvent system II, solvent A was water containing 0.1% glacial acetic acid, and solvent B was acetonitrile. The program consisted of a 5-min isocratic phase with 35% B in A, followed by a 35-min linear gradient to 85% B. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. Radioactivity of the column eluate was collected in 0.2-ml aliquots and measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. In some cases, fractions 15–50 from system I were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC using solvent system III. The solvents were identical to those used for solvent system II, but the program consisted of a 40-min isocratic phase with 31% B in A followed by a 20-min linear gradient to 100% B. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. To aid in the identification of the unknown factor isolated from rabbit aorta, a number of chemical modifications were performed on column fractions containing the factor. After incubation of aortic homogenate as described above, the incubation buffer was extracted and purified by reverse phase HPLC using solvent system I. The fractions (27Rubanyi G.M. Vanhoutte P.M.

The unknown factor was divided into two parts with one-half being treated with various reagents as described below and the other half retained for comparison. The resulting products were resolved by reverse phase HPLC using solvent system III as described above. The column eluate was collected in 0.5-ml aliquots, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. A change in migration time suggests a modification of the molecule. In each case, eicosanoids with known functional groups were treated with the same reagents and analyzed in a similar manner by reverse phase HPLC. The chemical modification procedures of the unknown factor included: The sample was dissolved in 100 μl of acetonitrile, 5 μl of dimethylformamide, 5 μl of diisopropylethylamine, and 3 μl of PFB bromide. After a 40-min incubation at 40 °C, the sample was partitioned between 6 ml of hexane and 4 ml of water. The organic layer was separated, and the extraction procedure was repeated. The organic fractions were pooled, evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen stream, and analyzed by HPLC. The sample was dissolved in 500 μl of methanol. After treatment with 1 ml of ethereal-diazomethane (CH2N2), the sample was incubated for 30 min at 0 °C. The sample was evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen stream and analyzed by HPLC. The sample was dissolved in 600 μl of tetrahydrofuran, 300 μl of water, and 10 μl of 70% perchloric acid. After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, the sample was extracted 3 times with cyclohexane:ethyl acetate (50:50). The organic fractions were pooled, evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen stream, and analyzed by HPLC. The sample was dissolved in 600 μl of methanol previously saturated with hydrogen. A small amount of platinum oxide was added to the solution. After a 6-min incubation, the sample was filtered through 500 mg of silica gel in a pasteur pipette. The sample was collected, evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen stream, and analyzed by HPLC. The sample was dissolved in 500 μl of methanol. Sodium borohydride (20 mg) was added, and the sample was incubated for 40 min at 0 °C. After the incubation, the sample was acidified and extracted with cyclohexane:ethyl acetate. The organic fractions were pooled, evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen stream, and analyzed by HPLC. The sample was dissolved in 500 μl of methanol and 500 μl of 0.1 m NaOH. Following a 4-h incubation at room temperature, the sample was acidified and extracted with cyclohexane:ethyl acetate. The organic fractions were pooled, evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen stream, and analyzed by HPLC. The methyl ester was made as described above. Then, 1 ml of t-butyldimethylsilylimidazole-dimethylformamide solution (Supelco) was added, and the sample was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After the incubation, 5 ml of cyclohexane:ethyl acetate and 5 ml of water were added. The organic fraction was removed, and extraction was repeated. The organic fractions were pooled, evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen stream, and analyzed by HPLC. The sample was dissolved in 3 ml of methanol and cooled to −78 °C. After 30 min of bubbling with ozone, the reaction was quenched with sodium borohydride. The sample was acidified and extracted with cyclohexane:ethyl acetate. The organic fractions were pooled, evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen stream, and analyzed by HPLC. The pooled fractions were isolated from solvent system II (fractions 88–94), which corresponded to the unknown factor previously described (8Pfister S.L. Spitzbarth N. Edgemond W. Campbell W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1021-H1030PubMed Google Scholar). The pooled fractions were extracted with cyclohexane/ethyl acetate, evaporated to dryness under nitrogen, and derivatized for GC-MS as described previously (10Pfister S.L. Falck J.R. Campbell W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: H843-H852PubMed Google Scholar, 18Pfister S.L. Schmitz J.M. Willerson J.T. Campbell W.B. Prostaglandins. 1988; 36: 515-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For electron impact (EI) or positive ion chemical ionization (PCI) MS analysis, the sample was dissolved in 120 μl of acetonitrile and then esterified with ethereal diazomethane for 6 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen, and the hydroxyl groups were then silylated with 15 μl of bis-TMS-trifluoroacetamide for 60 min at 37 °C. For negative ion chemical ionization MS, the sample was dissolved in 80 μl of acetonitrile, 20 μl of diisopropylethylamine, and 10 μl of PFB and allowed to react for 15 min at room temperature. The sample was extracted twice with water/ethyl acetate (1:1), and the organic fractions were pooled and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen. The PFB ester was then treated with bis-TMS-trifluoroacetamide, as described above. GC-MS was performed with a Hewlett Packard 5989A mass spectrometer coupled with a 5890 series 2 gas chromatograph. Ionization of the samples was done by electron impact at 65–70 eV or collisionally using methane as the reagent gas. The derivatized factor was resolved using a 14-m capillary DB-5 column (J & W Scientific Inc, Folsom, CA) with a linear gradient from 100 to 300 °C. Standards were derivatized and analyzed by GC-MS using the identical methods described for the biological samples. In an additional experiment, the 11.5–14-min fraction isolated from solvent system I was pooled, extracted, derivatized, and analyzed by PCI MS. Rabbit aortic homogenates were incubated with [U-14C]arachidonic acid or 15-lipoxygenase and [U-14C]arachidonic acid as described above. Identical control incubations without tissue (referred to as cell-free) were carried out in parallel. Incubations were also performed with [U-14C]arachidonic acid, 15-lipoxygenase, and hematin. After incubation and extraction, the samples were chromatographed on reverse phase HPLC using solvent system I. The fractions 27–35, corresponding to the unknown factor, were collected, extracted, and rechromatographed on reverse phase HPLC using solvent system II. This system further purified the unknown factor (fractions 88–94), which was then tested for biological activity. For these biological activity experiments, thoracic aortas were obtained from 1–2-month-old New Zealand White rabbits and placed in Krebs bicarbonate buffer (118 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 3.3 mmCaCl2, 24 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mmMgSO4, and 11 mm glucose) as described previously (10Pfister S.L. Falck J.R. Campbell W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: H843-H852PubMed Google Scholar). The tissue was carefully cleaned of adhering fat and connective tissue and cut into rings (3-mm thick) taking care not to damage the endothelium. Aortic rings were suspended in 6-ml tissue baths containing Krebs bicarbonate buffer maintained at 37 °C and continuously bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2. Isometric tension was measured with force-displacement transducers (Grass) and recorded with a Grass polygraph model 7D. Resting tension was adjusted to its length tension maximum of 2 g, and vessels were allowed to equilibrate for 1 h. Contractions were produced by increasing the KCl concentration of the baths to 40 mm. After the vessels reached peak contraction, tissue baths were rinsed, and vessels were allowed to return to resting tension. Once the aortic rings had reproducible, stable responses to KCl, the tissue was contracted with norepinephrine (10−7m). The effect of the unknown factor derived under the various incubation conditions was tested. The samples were suspended in a known volume of ethanol, and 10 μl/6-ml bath was the maximal ethanol concentration administered. Aortic incubations and cell free fractions were always analyzed in parallel and compared with its own control response. Fractions 57–70 obtained from aortic homogenates incubated with [U-14C]arachidonic acid and 15-lipoxygenase and isolated from reverse phase HPLC using solvent system I were tested for biological activity in a similar manner. Rabbit aortas were isolated and homogenized in cold 0.25m sucrose solution using a Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder with a Teflon pestle. Subcellular fractions were prepared by differential centrifugation (19Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Dishman E. Karara A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The homogenate was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 20 min to remove cellular debris, mitochondria, and nuclei. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100, 000 × g for 60 min. The microsomal pellet was resuspended in 1.15% KCl and homogenized. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The pelleted microsomes were resuspended in microsome incubation buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, pH 7.5) and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford technique (Bio-Rad) with IgG as the standard. Aliquots of microsomal protein (2 mg/ml) were incubated with [U-14C]arachidonic acid and 15-lipoxygenase as described above. Alternatively, incubations were performed with [U-14C]15-HPETE for 10 min at 37 °C. In a separate experiment, microsomes were pretreated with the cytochrome P450 inhibitor, miconazole (10−5m), before the addition of [U-14C]15-HPETE. Metabolites were extracted and chromatographed as described above using solvent system I then II. When aortic homogenate was incubated with [U-14C]arachidonic acid and extracted, and metabolites were resolved by reverse-phase HPLC using solvent system I, there was the synthesis of radioactive products that migrated with the prostaglandins, the dihydroxyeicosatrienoic-dihydroxyeicosatetranoic acids, and the HETEs (Fig. 1 A). Fractions 27–35 (5–7.5 min) were further analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC using solvent system II (Fig. 1 B). A number of radioactive peaks were observed and were labeled peaks 1–4. The major peak migrated at 17.5–18.5 min and was peak 2. Peak 2 represented 1.4 ± 0.2% of the added arachidonic acid (n = 7). Our previous results indicated that only peak 2 elicited relaxation of precontracted rabbit aorta (8Pfister S.L. Spitzbarth N. Edgemond W. Campbell W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1021-H1030PubMed Google Scholar). Because the previous results also suggested that peak 2 was derived from lipoxygenase-mediated metabolism of arachidonic acid, the next experiments investigated the effect of the addition of 15-lipoxygenase to the aortic homogenate incubations.14C-Arachidonic acid was incubated with 15-lipoxygenase plus the aortic homogenate or 15-lipoxygenase alone. The only product synthesized by 15-lipoxygenase alone comigrated with 15-HETE on HPLC using solvent system I (data not shown). With the combination of 15-lipoxygenase and the homogenate, three major radioactive peaks were observed with solvent system I (Fig. 2 A). One peak eluted with the unknown (fractions 27–35, 5–7.5 min), the second less polar peak eluted at 11.5–14 min (fractions 57.5–70), and the third major radioactive peak eluted with 15-HETE (fractions 100–120, 20–22 min). Analysis of the 5–7.5-min fraction using solvent system II indicated a pattern identical to the pattern observed with arachidonic acid and the homogenate, i.e. peak 2 was the major product (Fig. 2 B). The 11.5–14-min fraction comigrates with the hydroxyepoxyeicosatrienoic acids (HEETAs) according to previous reports (15Bryant R.W. Bailey J.M. Prog. Lipid Res. 1981; 20: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Weiss R.H. Arnold J.L. Estabrook R.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 252: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). With equal amounts of tissue incubated, the synthesis of peak 2 was much greater when 15-lipoxygenase was added (Figs. 1 and 2).Figure 2Effect of 15-lipoxygenase on the metabolism of [U-14C]arachidonic acid by rabbit aorta.

This report examines whether it also plays a role in normal mitotic progression. MAPK was transiently activated during mitosis in cycling Xenopus egg extracts after activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc2–cyclin B. Interference with MAPK activation by immunodepletion of its activator MEK, or by addition of the MEK inhibitor PD98059, caused precocious termination of mitosis and interfered with production of normal mitotic microtubules. Sustained activation of MAPK arrested extracts in mitosis in the absence of active Cdc2–cyclin B. These findings identify a role for MEK and MAPK in maintaining the mitotic state."

The upper tropospheric nitrogen oxides distribution was found to be strongly influenced by large-scale plumes extending about 100 to 1300 kilometers along the flight track. The plumes were frequently observed downwind of thunderstorms and frontal systems, which most probably caused upward transport of polluted air from the continental boundary layer or nitrogen oxide production in lightning strokes, or both. Particularly in summer, average ozone concentrations in the plumes were enhanced compared to the tropospheric background levels."

We tested the hypothesis that interaction of amphoterin with neuronal cells enhances RAGE expression, thereby providing a mechanism by which amphoterin-mediated regulation of RAGE might contribute to promotion of neurite growth and spreading. Incubation of cultured neuroblastoma cells with amphoterin resulted in increased transcription and translation of RAGE, a process largely inhibited in the presence of anti-RAGE IgG but not by nonimmune IgG. To begin to delineate molecular mechanisms underlying these findings, we identified multiple putative binding elements within the 5′-flanking region of the RAGE gene for Sp1, a transcription factor that has been critically linked to the process of normal development.

Transient transfection of cultured SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells with chimeric 5′-deletion constructs linked to luciferase reporter revealed that the region containing Sp1-binding elements did not contribute uniquely to basal expression of the RAGE gene. Simultaneous mutation of the multiple Sp1-binding elements in this region did not affect basal promoter function; however, promoter responsiveness to amphoterin was markedly attenuated.

In addition, RAGE interacts with amyloid β-peptide, consequences of which include enhanced neuronal and microglial oxidant stress and dysfunction (10Yan S.D. Chen X. Fu J. Chen M. Zhu H. Roher A.

These processes may be important in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. The expression of RAGE is strikingly enhanced in cells affected in settings associated with increased accumulation of AGEs and amyloid β-peptide (12Abel M. Ritthaler U. Zhang Y. Deng Y. Schmidt A.M.

We recently identified that an important means by which the expression of RAGE might be regulated in inflammatory-type milieu such as diabetic vasculature and wounds, and Alzheimer brain, is via two functional NF-kB-binding elements located with the 5′-flanking region of the RAGE gene (15Li J. Schmidt A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16498-16506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Transfection of 5′-deletion luciferase reporter gene constructs containing two mutated NF-kB-binding sites into either endothelial cells or vascular smooth muscle cells significantly diminished RAGE promoter responsiveness to prototypic inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (15Li J. Schmidt A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16498-16506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Our studies have also identified that the expression of RAGE is enhanced in the developing central nervous system, a setting in which excessive accumulation of AGEs and amyloid β-peptide is not likely (16Hori O.

Indeed, the increased expression of RAGE in neurons of the cerebrum, hippocampus, and cerebellum co-localized with that of the polypeptide amphoterin. In in vitro studies, amphoterin bound neuronal RAGE in a dose-dependent manner and mediated neurite outgrowth. In the presence of blockade of neuronal RAGE, employing either anti-RAGE F(ab′)2 or soluble RAGE, the extracellular two-thirds of RAGE (17Schmidt A.-M. Hasu M. Popov D. Zhang J.-H. Yan S.-D. Brett J.

We hypothesized that ligation of neuronal RAGE by amphoterin in the developing nervous system might be, at least in part, one means by which the expression of RAGE is enhanced in that setting. Such findings would suggest contributory mechanisms by which amphoterin-mediated regulation of RAGE promotes outgrowth of neurites. Since examination of the promoter of RAGE revealed multiple putative binding elements for Sp1, a transcription factor essential for early embryonic development (19Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 20Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that amphoterin-mediated activation of Sp1 might be important in regulation of RAGE expression in developing neurons. In this study, we demonstrate that interaction of amphoterin with RAGE on cultured neuroblastoma cells up-regulates transcription and translation of RAGE. The presence of functional Sp1-binding elements within the promoter of RAGE appears necessary for this outcome. These findings further suggest a role for amphoterin-RAGE interaction in the development of the nervous system and implicate RAGE as a gene whose regulation in the process of neuronal development is, at least in part, mediated by Sp1. SK-N-SH cells were obtained from American Type Tissue Corporation (Rockville, MD). SK-N-SH cells are derived from human neuroblastoma, and their neuronal origin has been extensively characterized (21Biedler J.L. Helson L. Spengler B.A. Cancer Res. 1973; 33: 2643-2652PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Medium 199 containing fetal bovine serum (FBS) (10%) (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in humidified incubators containing CO2 (5%). Monospecific, polyclonal anti-human RAGE IgG was used to prepare an ELISA for the detection of human RAGE. SK-N-SH cells were cultured in Medium 199 containing FBS (1%) for 16 h and then completely starved of serum for another 24 h. At the end of that time, cells were exposed to the indicated amount of recombinant rat amphoterin prepared, purified, and characterized as described previously (16Hori O. Brett J. Slattery T. Cao R.

Cells (1.5 × 106) were washed with PBS and lysed in buffer containing Tris, 0.02 m, pH 7.4; NaCl, 0.1m; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.002 m; and octyl-β-glucoside, 1% at 4 °C for 4 h and then centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and protein concentration determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). The supernatant was then diluted with appropriate amounts of sodium bicarbonate/carbonate buffer, pH 9.8, in order to coat equal amounts of protein (0.1 ml) onto each well of a plastic dish (Nunc Maxisorp). After 16 h at 4 °C, unbound sites on the plate were blocked in PBS buffer containing 1% BSA. Wells were then incubated with rabbit anti-RAGE IgG (34 μg/ml) (prepared and characterized as described previously; see Ref. 16Hori O. Brett J. Slattery T. Cao R. Zhang J. Chen J. Nagashima M.

A standard curve was prepared using human RAGE previously prepared and purified from a baculovirus expression system. The limit of detection in the assay is <0.001 ng/ml. SK-N-SH cells were cultured in Medium 199 containing FBS (1%) for 16 h prior to complete removal of serum for another 24 h. At the end of that time, cells were exposed to either recombinant rat amphoterin (40 μg/ml) or BSA (40 μg/ml) (Sigma) for 24 h. After washing with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline), cells were resuspended in PBS containing EDTA (final concentration, 0.05 m). After further washing to remove EDTA, cells were incubated with monospecific, polyclonal rabbit anti-human RAGE IgG for 1 h at 37 °C. The suspension was then washed in PBS, and cells were resuspended in fluorescent-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, cells were resuspended in PBS and subjected to flow cytometry (FACS Star Plus, Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Control incubations were performed using rabbit nonimmune IgG (Sigma). Immunohistochemistry for detection of cell-surface RAGE on SK-N-SH cells was performed as described previously (16Hori O.

SK-N-SH cells were grown in Medium 199 (1% FBS) for 16 h and then completely deprived of serum for 24 h. Following that time, cells were then incubated with the indicated amounts of amphoterin or BSA. Total RNA was isolated from SK-N-SH cells using TRI REAGENT® LS (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). The concentration of total RNA was determined by absorption at A 260/280 using a spectrophotometer (Pharmacia/LKB, Uppsala, Sweden). Total RNA (10 μg/lane) was subjected to electrophoresis. After electrophoretic separation on a formaldehyde gel (0.7%), RNA was transferred onto a GeneScreen hybridization filter (NEN Life Science Products) and linked by a UV cross-linker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The filter was then hybridized with the full-length human RAGE cDNA probe or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) cDNA probe labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the random primer labeling system (Stratagene). After washing twice at room temperature (15 min/wash) with SSC (2×) containing SDS (0.1%) and then with SSC (0.1×) containing SDS (0.1%) at 60 °C for 30 min, the filter was subjected to autoradiography at 80 °C. cDNA for G3PDH was used in control studies to normalize counts in the RAGE message by densitometry. Nuclear run-on transcription assay was performed as described previously (8Schmidt A.-M. Hori O. Chen J. Li J.F. Crandall J. Zhang J. Cao R. Yan S.D. Brett J. Stern D. J. Clin.

After incubation of SK-N-SH cells with amphoterin (40 μg/ml) or BSA (40 μg/ml) for 24 h at 37 °C, cells were washed twice with cold PBS, scraped, and pelleted by centrifugation. Pellets were then resuspended in lysis buffer (10 ml) containing Tris, 0.01m, pH 7.4; NaCl, 0.01 m; MgCl2, (0.003 m); Nonidet P-40 (0.5%); leupeptin, 50 μg/ml; dithiothreitol, 0.001 m; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.0005 m; and aprotinin, 100 μg/ml for 15 min on ice, and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The nuclear pellets were washed once with buffer as above (4 ml) and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were discarded, and nuclei were resuspended in 0.2 ml of reaction buffer containing Tris, 0.010 m, pH 8.0; MgCl2, 0.005 m; KCl, 0.3 m; dithiothreitol, 0.001 m; ATP, 0.0005 m; CTP, 0.0005 m; GTP, 0.0005 m; and 200 microcuries of [α-32P]UTP (3,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and reacted at 30 °C for 1 h. The RNA was extracted as above, and equal amounts of sample were resuspended in hybridization buffer containing PIPES, 0.05 m, pH 6.8; EDTA, 0.01 m; NaCl, 0.6 m; SDS, 0.2%; and denatured salmon test DNA, 100 μg/ml. Hybridization to denatured human RAGE and β-actin DNA slot-blotted onto nylon filters was performed at 42 °C for 72 h after pre-hybridization at 80 °C for 2 h in hybridization buffer as above containing SDS (0.1%) for 1 h three times, briefly air-dried, and exposed to autoradiographic film. For binding to the nylon filter, the human RAGE cDNA and β-actin cDNA were denatured by incubation with NaOH (0.3 n) for 30 min at 65 °C, and cDNA was spotted onto the nylon filter and cross-linked with a UV cross-linker. DNase I footprinting assay was employed to determine the binding capabilities of the putative Sp1-binding sites located within the 5′-flanking region of the human RAGE gene as revealed by computer analysis (Genetics Computer Group; see Ref. 23Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11514) Google Scholar). DNase I footprinting assay was performed with Core Footprinting System (Promega, Madison, WI) with modifications. An Sp1 probe spanning the region from −720 to +11 of the human RAGE gene was labeled at the 3′-end of the antisense strand with [α-32P]dGTP by the Klenow fragment (Stratagene). For each DNase I nicking reaction, 35 ng of the 32P-labeled DNA fragment was mixed in binding buffer (2×; 0.025 ml) containing BSA (200 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of the indicated amount of the purified human Sp1 (Promega) and incubated on ice for 4 h. To this was then added calcium/magnesium solution (0.05 ml) for 1 min at room temperature, followed by RQ 1 RNase-free DNase (0.003 ml), previously diluted 1:40 in dilution buffer, for 1 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by the addition of Stop Solution (prewarmed to 37 °C) (0.09 ml). The extraction reaction was then performed with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (0.2 ml) one time. The upper aqueous phase was transferred to fresh tubes, and ethanol (100%; 0.5 ml) was added for precipitation on ice for 20 min. The tubes were then subjected to centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min; supernatant was then removed, washed with ethanol (70%), and vacuum-dried. The pellet was resuspended in Loading Solution (0.004 ml), heated to 95 °C for 2 min, and then quickly chilled on ice for at least 2 min. The samples were then electrophoresed onto polyacrylamide sequencing gels (6%). Gels were then placed on x-ray film at −70 °C with an intensifying screen. SK-N-SH cells were washed once with PBS and cultured in Medium 199 containing FBS (1%) for 16 h. After complete removal of serum for another 24 h, cells were exposed to the indicated amounts of amphoterin or BSA for 8 h at 37 °C. The cell monolayer was washed twice with cold PBS and scraped into cold PBS (10 ml). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (24Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell suspension was subjected to centrifugation for 5 min at 3,500 rpm at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was then resuspended in cold buffer A (0.4 ml) (HEPES, 0.01 m; pH 7.9; KCl, 0.01m; EDTA, 0.001 m; dithiothreitol 0.001m; and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 m) and incubated on ice for 15 min, to which was then added Nonidet P-40 (10%). The mixture was vortexed for 15 s, and the cell lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, after which time the supernatants were retrieved. The nuclear pellet was washed once with buffer A (0.1 ml) and resuspended in ice-cold buffer B (0.1 ml) (HEPES, 0.02 m; pH 7.9; NaCl, 0.4m; EDTA, 0.001 m; dithiothreitol, 0.001m; and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.001 m)for 15 min at 4 °C with constant agitation. The nuclear lysate was then subjected to centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the nuclear extract was collected. The concentration of nuclear protein was then determined at A 280 using an Ultra-Spec spectrophotometer. Based on the results of DNase I footprinting assays, four double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were designed (see Fig. 5 A). (23Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O.

For competition assays, nuclear extracts were incubated with 100-fold molar excess of the indicated unlabeled nucleotides for 15 min at room temperature prior to incubation with the end-labeled oligonucleotide probes. Consensus sequence oligonucleotides for Sp1 were obtained from Promega; and consensus oligonucleotides were synthesized (Life Technologies) for the following: NF-IL6 (5′-GGGAAAATGCAGATTGCGCAATCTGCAAAAGGG-3′); AP-2 (5′-GGGAATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGTAGGG-3′); and NF-kB (5′-GGGAAAAGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGAAAGGG-3′) (Santa Cruz). For supershift assays, nuclear extract was incubated with antibody prepared against human Sp1, NF-kB p50/p65, NF-IL6, or AP2 (Santa Cruz) for 4 h prior to the addition of the indicated probes. 5′-Deletion fragments of the RAGE promoter and PCR-directed mutagenesis constructs of the RAGE promoter were created by subcloning into the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) different fragments of DNA PCR-amplified from the 5′-flanking region of the human RAGE gene (Figs. 6 and 7). Due to the close proximity of Sp1 II/III, a single mutation construct encompassing these two potential binding sites was generated. All constructs employed for transfection were confirmed by DNA sequencing using ALFexpress DNA sequencing system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Figure 7PCR-directed mutagenesis and relative luciferase activities of chimera from the 5′-flanking region of the RAGE gene expressed in cultured SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells.PCR-directed mutagenesis was performed as indicated in the figure for each of the Sp1-binding sites in the 5′-flanking region of the human RAGE gene by substitution of the nucleotides (underlined) in each of the sites. The original sequences for the Sp1-binding sites are shown in pGL-245 (top construct). Relative luciferase activities from cultured SK-N-SH cells transfected with the above constructs under either basal (BSA) or amphoterin-stimulated conditions are shown after normalization for galactosidase activity. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of three or more separate experiments. Statistical analyses (ANOVA) of basal conditions (BSA) are as follows. Under basal conditions (treatment of the cells with BSA), the presence of single or multiple mutations had no significant effect on relative luciferase activity compared with that of wild-type construct (pGL-245), p > 0.05 in each case. Amphoterin stimulation is as follows: in the setting of stimulation with amphoterin, the presence of single mutations (lines 2, 7 and 11) or double mutations (lines 3, 4 and 8) not involving Sp1 V, no significant effect on relative luciferase activity compared with wild-type (pGL-245) was noted,p > 0.05. When Sp1 V was mutated either singly (line 13) or in double mutations (lines 5, 9, and 12), relative luciferase activity decreased significantly compared with that of pGL-245; p < 0.01 in each case. When triple mutations were generated without affecting Sp1 V (line 6), no significant effect was noted on relative luciferase activity compared with pGL-245, p > 0.05. When triple mutations including Sp1 V were generated (lines 10, 14, and 15), significant reduction in relative luciferase activity was observed compared with that of pGL-245,p < 0.01. When all Sp1-binding sites were simultaneously mutated (Sp1M, line 16), a significant decrease in relative luciferase activity compared with that of pGL-245 was observed, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SK-N-SH cells were grown and maintained as described above. Transfection of the cells was performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 2 × 105 cells were plated onto the wells of tissue culture plates (6-wells, Corning, Corning, NY) 1 day prior to transfection. The DNA mixture for transfection was composed of test plasmid (2 μg) and pSV-β-galactosidase (0.5 μg) which served as internal control to normalize activities of luciferase. Cells were exposed to the mixture of LipofectAMINE and plasmid for 5 h. Following removal of the LipofectAMINE/plasmid mixture, fresh medium was added and the incubation continued for 48 h. Prior to studies of basal-stimulated function of the RAGE promoter, cells were washed with PBS and placed in medium as above, except that serum was omitted for 24 h prior to further studies. Where indicated, stimulus (amphoterin or BSA) was added to the medium 24 h prior to harvesting. Luciferase activity was determined using standard reagents (Promega) and measured in a luminometer (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD) as directed, and results were standardized for β-galactosidase activity. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA (analysis of variance). Increased expression of RAGE in the developing neurons of the central nervous system co-localizes with high levels of expression of amphoterin. In order to determine if interaction of amphoterin with RAGE, at least in part, mediated this phenomenon, we tested the ability of amphoterin to regulate the expression of RAGE. Incubation of cultured neuroblastoma cells with amphoterin for 24 h revealed an ≈6.1-fold increase in mRNA for RAGE (Fig. 1 A, lane 4), when compared with incubation with BSA (Fig. 1 A, lane 5). The effects of amphoterin were mediated by interaction with cell-surface RAGE as demonstrated by suppression of amphoterin-stimulated RAGE expression in the presence of anti-RAGE IgG (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). In contrast, preincubation of neuroblastoma cells with nonimmune IgG prior to exposure to amphoterin had no effect (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). Incubation of SK-N-SH cells with anti-RAGE IgG alone had no effect on expression of RAGE (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). The enhanced mRNA for RAGE by amphoterin was dose-dependent. Maximal levels (6.1-fold enhancement) of mRNA for RAGE were noted in the presence of amphoterin, 40 μg/ml (Fig. 1 B). Nuclear run-on transcription assay revealed that amphoterin-mediated increase in mRNA for RAGE was due to enhanced transcription (Fig. 1 C). Consistent with enhanced mRNA for RAGE in amphoterin-treated cultured neuroblastoma cells, increased cellular RAGE antigen was detected by ELISA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A). Compared with cells treated with BSA, an ≈5.2-fold increase (p < 0.01) in RAGE protein was noted in the presence of amphoterin. That these effects were mediated by RAGE was demonstrated by inhibition of amphoterin-mediated expression of RAGE in the presence of anti-RAGE IgG, but not nonimmune IgG (Fig. 2 B). Incubation of SK-N-SH cells with anti-RAGE IgG alone was without effect. Increased cell-surface RAGE in the presence of amphoterin was further confirmed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicated that amphoterin modulated expression of RAGE in cultured neuroblastoma cells in a RAGE-dependent manner. In our previous studies, we identified two putative binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 (designated Sp1 II and Sp1 V) (Fig. 3) in the promoter of RAGE using computer analysis (Genetics Computer Group; 23) by matching consensus sequences for Sp1 with those in the RAGE promoter. To determine if the putative Sp1-binding sites within the promoter of RAGE were functional, DNase I footprinting analysis was performed. By using purified human Sp1 and 32P-labeled RAGE promoter fragment from −720 to +11, protection of Sp1 sites (II and V) was demonstrated (Fig. 4 A). Surprisingly, three more protected areas were noted (Sp1 I, Sp1 III, and Sp1 IV (Fig. 3). Comparison of the core nucleotide sequences comprising these footprints with the Sp1 consensus reported by Bucher (25Bucher P.J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 563-578Crossref Scopus (969) Google Scholar) revealed nearly 100% identity, or one nucleotide difference (Fig. 4 B). In order to determine if amphoterin induced activation of Sp1 DNA binding activity in neuroblastoma cells, SK-N-SH cells were treated with BSA, amphoterin, or amphoterin in the presence of anti-RAGE IgG or nonimmune IgG. Nuclear extracts were prepared and EMSA performed employing either Sp1 consensus probe or specific Sp1-binding site probes synthesized"

Apoptosis is a form of cell death utilized physiologically to maintain tissue homeostasis, as well as in response to various toxic stimuli, such as cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Apoptosis is characterized by cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, condensation of the chromatin around the periphery of the nucleus, and DNA fragmentation (1Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6697) Google Scholar). Many stimuli can induce a cell to undergo apoptosis. Most of these stimuli, such as the Fas ligand or cisplatin, interact with defined primary targets, but the pathways that lead to the subsequent apoptotic death remain to be fully elucidated.Much work has been done to identify various steps in the pathway leading to apoptosis. Many of these discoveries can be attributed to the study of model organisms such as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in which the death of specific cells occurs at well defined developmental times. C. elegans proteins such as CED-3 and CED-9 have been found to have mammalian homologs that are implicated in apoptosis (2Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar). For example, BCL-2 is the human homolog of CED-9, and is well known as a suppresser of apoptosis in both species (3Hengartner M.O. Ellis R.E. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). CED-3 is the prototype for a family of cysteine proteases now termed caspases that cleave substrates at the carboxy side of an aspartate residue and function to transduce a signal that leads to the degradation of the chromatin (4Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar).The enzyme responsible for the DNA digestion observed in apoptosis has yet to be conclusively identified. It has frequently been suggested that this endonuclease is Ca2+- and Mg2+-dependent (5Nikonova L.V. Nelipovich P.A. Umansky S.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 699: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 6Cohen J.J. Duke R.C. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 38-42PubMed Google Scholar, 7McConkey D.J. Hartzell P. Duddy S.K. Hakansson H.

Cidlowski J.A. Cell Death Differ. 1994; 1: 11-17PubMed Google Scholar). This laboratory initially attempted to purify the Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent endonuclease from CHO1 cells, but no such endonuclease was detected. However, an acid-activated endonuclease was found in these cells. This enzyme was purified and identified as deoxyribonuclease II (DNase II) (10Barry M.A. Eastman A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). DNase II is active only at low pH, and studies have consistently shown that all cells undergoing apoptosis also undergo intracellular acidification (11Barry M.A. Reynolds J.E. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2349-2357PubMed Google Scholar, 12Li J. Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3203-3211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 13Reynolds J.E. Li J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18263-18271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Endonuclease activity was also studied in many different leukemic cell lines, and internucleosomal DNA digestion was stimulated at an acidic pH (15Yanagisawa-Shiota F. Sakagami H. Kuribayashi N. Iida M. Sakagami T. Takeda M. Anticancer Res. 1995; 15: 259-266PubMed Google Scholar). Additional studies show that cells can undergo apoptosis after the chelation of Ca2+ hence obviating an essential role for Ca2+ in DNA digestion (16Barry M.A. Eastman A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 782-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 17Reynolds J.E. Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27739-27743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These studies all suggest that DNase II may be involved in apoptotic DNA digestion.To better study the role of DNase II in the apoptotic process we have cloned its cDNA. To accomplish this, we purified bovine DNase II and obtained the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence, facilitating cloning of the bovine cDNA. We have subsequently cloned the complete human cDNA. Full-length cDNA for the human enzyme was subcloned into an expression vector and found to induce apoptosis when transfected into cells.DISCUSSIONMany different endonucleases have been proposed as candidates responsible for the internucleosomal cleavage of the genomic DNA observed during apoptosis. Originally, the apoptotic DNA degradation was attributed to a Ca2+-activated endonuclease in thymocytes (5Nikonova L.V. Nelipovich P.A. Umansky S.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 699: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 6Cohen J.J. Duke R.C. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 38-42PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wyllie A.H. Morris R.G. Smith A.L. Dunlop D. J. Pathol. 1984; 142: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar). Others have implicated various Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent endonucleases, including DNase I, Nuc18, and, more recently DNase γ, a DNase I homolog found in rat thymocyte nuclei (8Peitsch M.C. Polzar B. Tschopp J. Mannherz H.G. Cell Death Differ. 1994; 1: 1-6PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hughes F.M. Cidlowski J.A. Cell Death Differ. 1994; 1: 11-17PubMed Google Scholar, 26Gaido M.L. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol.

J. 1997; 326: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, considerable evidence suggests that Ca2+ is not required for DNA digestion (32Eastman A. Cell Death Differ. 1994; 1: 7-9PubMed Google Scholar). For example, depletion of Ca2+ from cells is an effective means to induce internucleosomal DNA digestion (17Reynolds J.E. Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27739-27743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).This laboratory was the first to suggest that DNase II might be an alternate endonuclease involved in apoptosis (10Barry M.A. Eastman A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). One criticism often made of the role of DNase II in apoptosis is the assumption that it is a lysosomal enzyme and not present in the nuclei, although we originally identified the acidic endonuclease activity in the nuclei of CHO cells. Other groups have also reported DNase II activity in the nucleus (33Vorbrodt A. Busch H. The Cell Nucleus. 3. Academic Press, New York1974: 309-344Crossref Google Scholar, 34Anzai N. Kawabata H. Hirama T. Masutani H. Yoshida Y. Okuma M. Blood. 1995; 86: 917-923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while others suggest that an acidic nuclease activity is translocated from the cytosolic compartment to the nucleus during apoptosis (15Yanagisawa-Shiota F. Sakagami H. Kuribayashi N. Iida M. Sakagami T. Takeda M. Anticancer Res. 1995; 15: 259-266PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore DNase II appears to be present in the nucleus and more could be translocated from the cytosol during apoptosis.Other reports have also implicated DNase II in the process of apoptosis. When lens fiber cells differentiate, they lose their nuclei in a process that is very similar to apoptosis. The chromatin condenses and the cells degrade their genomic DNA. A nuclease present in fiber cells was found to be cation-independent, and the fragmented DNA had no 3′-hydroxy termini that would result from a DNase I-type nuclease (36Chaudun E. Arruti C. Courtois Y. Ferrag F. Jeanny J.C. Patel B.N. Skidmore C. Torriglia A. Counis M.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). DNase II was found by immunocytochemistry to be localized in the cytoplasm but translocated to the nucleus of the fiber cell before degeneration (35Torriglia A. Chaudun E. Chany-Fournier F. Jeanny J. Courtois Y. Counis M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28579-28585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These findings suggest DNase II is the endonuclease responsible for the genomic degradation observed during lens nuclear degeneration.We have observed intracellular acidification in numerous models of apoptosis, which is consistent with the involvement of DNase II (11Barry M.A. Reynolds J.E. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2349-2357PubMed Google Scholar, 12Li J. Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3203-3211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 13Reynolds J.E. Li J. Craig R.W. Eastman A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 14Morana S. Wolf C.M. Li J. Reynolds J.E. Brown M.K. Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18263-18271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, we have shown recently that low intracellular pH is not required for DNA digestion during apoptosis and furthermore that low pH can actually suppress apoptosis by preventing activation of caspases (12Li J. Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3203-3211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 37Reynolds J.E. Wolf C.M. Eastman A. Int. J. Oncol. 1997; 11: 1241-1246PubMed Google Scholar). It was therefore surprising that transfection of pDNase II induced apoptosis in cells grown under normal culture conditions, suggesting that this protein has activity at neutral pH. All previous analysis of the catalytic activity of DNase II has been performed with a 31-kDa protein, which we now show is truncated from the 40-kDa full-length form. It is possible that this larger protein has different catalytic requirements, and in particular, it may be active at neutral pH. Unfortunately, attempts so far to produce recombinant forms of this full-length protein have been compromised by the lethality of the constructs.An alternate explanation for the chromatin condensation appearing after transfection with pDNase II is that another endonuclease is activated. The proteolytic cascade of apoptosis mediated by caspases is normally required for DNA digestion; this can be suppressed by the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk. In these studies, we showed that zVAD-fmk did not prevent chromatin condensation following transfection with pDNase II, suggesting that other endonucleases were not responsible. Accordingly, it appears that the chromatin condensation is a direct consequence of the action of DNase II.Several caspases have been implicated in apoptosis, and numerous substrates have been reported. The caspase family of proteases cleave their substrates on the carboxy side of an aspartate residue. The coding sequence of DNase II contains a potential caspase cleavage site immediately upstream of the terminal serine in the 31-kDa bovine protein that was originally purified and sequenced. This indicated that the protein was produced as a larger precursor and subsequently modified to the acid-active 31-kDa protein by proteolytic cleavage at an aspartate residue. The cleavage site is ESQD in bovine and KSQD in human. Both of these potential recognition sequences have charged residues in the P4 position. The amino acid Lys at position P4 is not a known caspase cleavage site, but Glu at this position is found in a number of substrates of caspase 3 (38Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar).Lysosomal proteins are commonly cleaved after translocation to the lysosomes. The amino terminus of DNase II contains a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids which, by comparison with other lysosomal proteins, is likely to be a signal sequence. Such sequences are readily cleaved by cathepsins; in this case, the predicted cleavage site is prior to leucine 17 (23Yasuda T. Takeshita H. Iida R. Nakajima T. Hosomi O. Nakashima Y. Kishi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2610-2616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, the amino acid sequence around the amino terminus of the 31-kDa fragment is not a consensus sequence for lysosomal cathepsins (39Offermann M.K. Chlebowski J.F. Bond J.S. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 40Imoto T. Okazaki K. Koga H. Yamada H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 41van Noort J.M. van der Drift A.C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14159-14164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from caspases, the only other protease known to cleave at aspartic acid is a lymphocyte granule protease called granzyme or fragmentin (42Shi L. Kam C.-M. Powers J.C. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). It is interesting that an earlier report of DNase II suggested it was a dimer of 35 and 10 kDa, which could represent the two fragments of the protein predicted here (19Liao T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10708-10713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the same report suggested both fragments were required for activity. During our purification over the S-Sepharose column, we observed a 10-kDa fragment that separated from DNase II but did not result in loss of DNase II activity (data not shown).The gene for DNase II was originally assigned to chromosome 19 using somatic cell hybrid studies in which mouse cells with a human chromosome 19 displayed higher acidic endonuclease activity (22Brook J.D. Shaw D.J. Meredith L. Bruns G.A.P. Harper P.S. Hum. Genet. 1984; 68: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The exact localization of this gene has been found to be chromosome 19p13.2. The genomic sequence analysis predicted one different splice junction than observed in the cloned cDNA. This computer prediction is unlikely to be correct, since the ESTs found thus far confirm the cloned cDNA sequence. The human genomic sequence was compared with the genomic sequences of the three C. elegans homologs. There was significant conservation observed between human and the threeC. elegans proteins. The 30–36% identity between DNase II and the three C. elegans homologs is comparable with the 35% identity between caspase 3 and CED-3 (43Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Fernandes-Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30761-30764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and considerably greater than the 23% identity between BCL-2 and CED-9 (44Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 665-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). It is also interesting that no significant homology is observed in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting some function particularly important to a multicellular organism.The identification of the three C. elegans genes may suggest that DNase II could be a family of enzymes. In addition, there is considerable evolutionary conservation of the gene structure as exemplified by the conservation of two splice junctions in the homologs and the human sequences. A C. elegans nuclease, Nuc-1, was previously shown to have a role in DNA digestion following engulfment of a cell corpse (45Ellis R.E. Jacobson D.M. Horvitz H.R. Genetics. 1991; 129: 79-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, dying cells in Nuc-1-defective nematodes demonstrated a greater number of DNA breaks in the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay, presumably because Nuc-1 is only required for secondary destruction of already fragmented DNA. 3R. Horvitz, unpublished observation. This indicates that additional endonucleases must exist to degrade DNA during apoptosis. The genes for the DNase II homologs are all on separate loci from Nuc-1, indicating that they are indeed separate genes and should be examined for a role in the apoptotic process.There has been controversy for many years over which endonuclease is responsible for the DNA digestion that occurs during apoptosis. Very recently, a caspase-activated DNase (CAD) was reported as a new candidate (46Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2795) Google Scholar). This endonuclease requires Mg2+, but not Ca2+, consistent with the discussion above that Ca2+ is not required for apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Most intriguing is the observation that CAD dimerizes with an inhibitor, ICAD, that is cleaved during apoptosis. The human homolog of murine ICAD had already been identified as “DNA fragmentation factor,” a protein whose cleavage was shown to trigger DNA digestion (47Liu X. Zou H. Slughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). Hence, CAD is possibly the best candidate for endonuclease activity during apoptosis, although it is possible that ICAD may also inhibit other endonucleases. DNase II remains a possible alternative as it is found ubiquitously in tissues unlike most other candidates; the only cell line we have found that had no detectable DNase II mRNA is noted for its resistance to apoptotic DNA digestion. DNase II is also highly conserved through evolution suggesting its importance in some physiological process. Since completion of this work, another group has also published the cloning of human DNase II, although their cDNA sequence lacks much of the 3′-untranslated sequence (23Yasuda T. Takeshita H. Iida R. Nakajima T. Hosomi O. Nakashima Y. Kishi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2610-2616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The current paper adds the exact chromosomal location, the genomic structure, and homology with other species. The cloning of the cDNA will facilitate studies of its activity as well as establishing its biological functions and localization in cells. The transfection experiments presented here clearly show the potential of this enzyme to induce the DNA degradation observed during apoptosis. Future studies will be aimed to definitively establish any role in this process. Apoptosis is a form of cell death utilized physiologically to maintain tissue homeostasis, as well as in response to various toxic stimuli, such as cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Apoptosis is characterized by cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, condensation of the chromatin around the periphery of the nucleus, and DNA fragmentation (1Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6697) Google Scholar). Many stimuli can induce a cell to undergo apoptosis. Most of these stimuli, such as the Fas ligand or cisplatin, interact with defined primary targets, but the pathways that lead to the subsequent apoptotic death remain to be fully elucidated. Much work has been done to identify various steps in the pathway leading to apoptosis. Many of these discoveries can be attributed to the study of model organisms such as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in which the death of specific cells occurs at well defined developmental times. C. elegans proteins such as CED-3 and CED-9 have been found to have mammalian homologs that are implicated in apoptosis (2Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar). For example, BCL-2 is the human homolog of CED-9, and is well known as a suppresser of apoptosis in both species (3Hengartner M.O. Ellis R.E. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). CED-3 is the prototype for a family of cysteine proteases now termed caspases that cleave substrates at the carboxy side of an aspartate residue and function to transduce a signal that leads to the degradation of the chromatin (4Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). The enzyme responsible for the DNA digestion observed in apoptosis has yet to be conclusively identified. It has frequently been suggested that this endonuclease is Ca2+- and Mg2+-dependent (5Nikonova L.V. Nelipovich P.A. Umansky S.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 699: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 6Cohen J.J. Duke R.C. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 38-42PubMed Google Scholar, 7McConkey D.J. Hartzell P. Duddy S.K. Hakansson H.

Cidlowski J.A. Cell Death Differ. 1994; 1: 11-17PubMed Google Scholar). This laboratory initially attempted to purify the Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent endonuclease from CHO1 cells, but no such endonuclease was detected. However, an acid-activated endonuclease was found in these cells. This enzyme was purified and identified as deoxyribonuclease II (DNase II) (10Barry M.A. Eastman A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). DNase II is active only at low pH, and studies have consistently shown that all cells undergoing apoptosis also undergo intracellular acidification (11Barry M.A. Reynolds J.E. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2349-2357PubMed Google Scholar, 12Li J. Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3203-3211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 13Reynolds J.E. Li J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18263-18271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Endonuclease activity was also studied in many different leukemic cell lines, and internucleosomal DNA digestion was stimulated at an acidic pH (15Yanagisawa-Shiota F. Sakagami H. Kuribayashi N. Iida M. Sakagami T. Takeda M. Anticancer Res. 1995; 15: 259-266PubMed Google Scholar). Additional studies show that cells can undergo apoptosis after the chelation of Ca2+ hence obviating an essential role for Ca2+ in DNA digestion (16Barry M.A. Eastman A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 782-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 17Reynolds J.E. Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27739-27743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These studies all suggest that DNase II may be involved in apoptotic DNA digestion. To better study the role of DNase II in the apoptotic process we have cloned its cDNA. To accomplish this, we purified bovine DNase II and obtained the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence, facilitating cloning of the bovine cDNA. We have subsequently cloned the complete human cDNA. Full-length cDNA for the human enzyme was subcloned into an expression vector and found to induce apoptosis when transfected into cells. DISCUSSIONMany different endonucleases have been proposed as candidates responsible for the internucleosomal cleavage of the genomic DNA observed during apoptosis. Originally, the apoptotic DNA degradation was attributed to a Ca2+-activated endonuclease in thymocytes (5Nikonova L.V. Nelipovich P.A. Umansky S.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 699: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 6Cohen J.J. Duke R.C. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 38-42PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wyllie A.H. Morris R.G. Smith A.L. Dunlop D. J. Pathol. 1984; 142: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar). Others have implicated various Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent endonucleases, including DNase I, Nuc18, and, more recently DNase γ, a DNase I homolog found in rat thymocyte nuclei (8Peitsch M.C. Polzar B. Tschopp J. Mannherz H.G. Cell Death Differ. 1994; 1: 1-6PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hughes F.M. Cidlowski J.A. Cell Death Differ. 1994; 1: 11-17PubMed Google Scholar, 26Gaido M.L. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol.

J. 1997; 326: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, considerable evidence suggests that Ca2+ is not required for DNA digestion (32Eastman A. Cell Death Differ. 1994; 1: 7-9PubMed Google Scholar). For example, depletion of Ca2+ from cells is an effective means to induce internucleosomal DNA digestion (17Reynolds J.E. Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27739-27743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).This laboratory was the first to suggest that DNase II might be an alternate endonuclease involved in apoptosis (10Barry M.A. Eastman A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). One criticism often made of the role of DNase II in apoptosis is the assumption that it is a lysosomal enzyme and not present in the nuclei, although we originally identified the acidic endonuclease activity in the nuclei of CHO cells. Other groups have also reported DNase II activity in the nucleus (33Vorbrodt A. Busch H. The Cell Nucleus. 3. Academic Press, New York1974: 309-344Crossref Google Scholar, 34Anzai N. Kawabata H. Hirama T. Masutani H. Yoshida Y. Okuma M. Blood. 1995; 86: 917-923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while others suggest that an acidic nuclease activity is translocated from the cytosolic compartment to the nucleus during apoptosis (15Yanagisawa-Shiota F. Sakagami H. Kuribayashi N. Iida M."
https://openalex.org/W2032137122,"Exposure of CV-1P cells to hypoxic conditions results in reversible cell cycle arrest concomitant with accumulation of pRB in the hypophosphorylated, growth suppressive form. Similar to cell cycle arrest induced by serum starvation, we show here that hypoxia-induced arrest is accompanied by a decrease in pRB-directed CDK4 and CDK2 activities, lower cyclin D and E protein levels, and by an increase in p27 protein abundance. Immunoprecipitation studies reveal an increase in p27 association with cyclin E-CDK2 complexes. In contrast to cell cycle arrest induced by serum starvation, hypoxia increases PP1-mediated pRB dephosphorylation. These data reveal that synergy between decreased pRB-directed cyclin/CDK activity and increased pRB-directed phosphatase activity contribute towards inducing and maintaining pRB in its hypophosphorylated, growth suppressive state during hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2064373917,"The NIFS protein from Azobacter vinelandii is a pyridoxal phosphate-containing homodimer that catalyzes the formation of equimolar amounts of elemental sulfur andl-alanine from the substrate l-cysteine (Zheng, L., White, R. H., Cash, V. L., Jack, R. F., and Dean, D. R. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 2754–2758). A sulfur transfer role of NIFS in which the enzyme donates sulfur for iron sulfur center formation in nitrogenase was suggested. The fact that NIFS also can catalyze the decomposition ofl-selenocysteine to elemental selenium andl-alanine suggested the possibility that this enzyme might serve as a selenide delivery protein for the in vitrobiosynthesis of selenophosphate. In agreement with this hypothesis, we have shown that replacement of selenide with NIFS andl-selenocysteine in the in vitroselenophosphate synthetase assay results in an increased rate of formation of selenophosphate. These results thus support the view that a selenocysteine-specific enzyme similar to NIFS may be involved as anin vivo selenide delivery protein for selenophosphate biosynthesis. A kinetic characterization of the two NIFS catalyzed reactions carried out in the present study indicates that the enzyme favors l-cysteine as a substrate compared with its selenium analog. A specific activity for l-cysteine of 142 nmol/min/mg compared with 55 nmol/min/mg forl-selenocysteine was determined. This level of enzyme activity on the selenoamino acid substrate is adequate to deliver selenium to selenophosphate synthetase in the in vitroassay system described. The NIFS protein from Azobacter vinelandii is a pyridoxal phosphate-containing homodimer that catalyzes the formation of equimolar amounts of elemental sulfur andl-alanine from the substrate l-cysteine (Zheng, L., White, R.

N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine dithiothretiol. The insertion of selenium into Se-dependent enzymes and Se-tRNAs requires the formation of the highly reactive, reduced selenium donor compound monoselenophosphate (1Glass R.S. Singh W.P. Jung W. Veres Z. Scholz T.D. Stadtman T.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12255-12559Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli selD gene product, selenophosphate synthetase, catalyzes the synthesis of monoselenophosphate from selenide and ATP (Scheme 1) (2Veres Z. Kim I.Y. Scholz T.D. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10597-10603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP+HSe−+H20→H2SePO3−+Pi+AMP SCHEME 1 Selenophosphate synthetase from E. coli has been characterized previously (2Veres Z. Kim I.Y. Scholz T.D. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10597-10603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme has a determined specific activity of 83 nmol/min/mg (kcat = 3 min−1). The initial K m values reported for each substrate, ATP and selenide, were 0.9 mm and 46 μm, respectively. Selenide is extremely oxygen labile, so the kinetics were repeated using more stringent anaerobic conditions. Under these conditions, the K m for selenide was calculated as 7.3 μm, which is still above the range of 0.1–1 μm which is the optimal concentration of selenite used in most growth media. Despite being below theK m value for one essential enzyme in the pathway, this concentration of selenide is sufficient for the biosynthesis of selenium-containing proteins and tRNAs. The E. coli selenophosphate synthetase contains an essential cysteine, Cys17, within the glycine-rich sequence -Gly-Ala-Gly-Cys17-Gly-Cys-Lys-Ile-. Replacement of Cys17 with serine results in complete loss of activity with selenide and ATP as substrates (3Kim I.Y Veres Z. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19650-19654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, both a human form of the enzyme that contains threonine (4Low S.C. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21659-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) in place of the essential Cys17 in the E. coli enzyme and aDrosophila enzyme that has an arginine replacement (5Persson B.C. Bock A. Jackle H. Vorbruggen G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) are inactive in the in vitro selenophosphate synthetase assay with selenide and ATP as substrates. The observed low specific activity of the E. coli selenophosphate synthetase and the inactivity of human and Drosophila homologs suggests that an essential unidentified component is required for the formation of selenophosphate. In an early attempt to understand the mechanism of the incorporation of selenocysteine into proteins, 3H-, 14C-, and75Se-labeled l-selenocysteine samples were prepared. These labeled compounds were added to media of Clostridium sticklandii cultures to determine whether they were capable of being directly incorporated into selenoprotein A of the glycine reductase complex. 75Se derived from [75Se]selenocysteine was incorporated more efficiently into selenoprotein A than H275Se (generated by reduction of 75SeO32− by excess thiols in the incubation medium). There was no detectable incorporation of 14C or 3H into the selenocysteine amino acid of selenoprotein A (6Stadtman T.C. Dilworth G.L. Chen C.S. Cagniant D. Kirsch G. Proceedings of the Third International Symposium on Organic Selenium and Tellurium Compounds. Mety, France1979: 115-130Google Scholar). These results suggest an activated selenium derived from l-selenocysteine may be the optimal substrate for selenophosphate synthetase. Additionally, this suggests the involvement of a selenocysteine lyase protein in substrate formation. Selenocysteine lyase enzymes have been isolated from both bacteria (7Esaki N. Seraneeprakan V. Tanaka H. Soda K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 751-756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and pig liver (8Esaki N. Nakamura T. Tanaka M. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4386-4391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This family of enzymes catalyzes the exclusive decomposition of l-selenocysteine to l-alanine and elemental selenium. They are very specific for their seleno-amino acid substrate and do not utilize the sulfur analogl-cysteine as a substrate. Recently, Mihara et al. (9Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yosimura T. Soda K. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22417-22424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) have found that the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the pig liver selenocysteine lyase is similar to the amino acid sequence of the cysteine desulfurase protein NIFS. The nifS gene product (NIFS) from the diazotrophic bacteriumAzotobacter vinelandii has been previously isolated and characterized. The protein has been identified as a pyridoxal phosphate-containing homodimer that catalyzes the formation of equimolar amounts of elemental sulfur and l-alanine from the substrate, l-cysteine (10Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). It was reported that NIFS is also able to catalyze the removal of selenium from selenocysteine; a mechanism similar to the l-cysteine reaction was postulated (11Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In this work, we report the characterization of the NIFS catalyzed reaction with l-selenocysteine as substrate. We also report the use of NIFS and l-selenocysteine as a selenide delivery system in the selenophosphate synthetase assay. A. vinelandii NIFS protein and pDB551 (nifSgene under control of the T7 promotor) were gifts from Dennis Dean, Virginia Polytechnic Institute. All buffers and reagents were prepared from the highest grade chemicals available. A. vinelandii NIFS was overexpressed in E. coli cells and purified by a procedure as described previously, with slight modifications (10Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). BL21 cells transformed with pDB551 were grown in a 10-liter fermentor containing ampicillin (50 mg/liter) at 37 °C to an A 600 of 0.6. Cells were induced by the addition of lactose to a concentration of 0.4%. After 2.5 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C until needed. 20 grams of E. coliBL21 cells containing overexpressed NIFS were thawed in 50 ml of 25 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4). Extract was prepared by passing the cell suspension once through a French pressure cell. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. Streptomycin sulfate was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 15%. After 15 min, the precipitate was sedimented by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 45% of saturation, and the protein precipitate was resuspended in 10 ml of 25 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4). The redissolved ammonium sulfate precipitate was desalted on PD10 columns equilibrated with 25 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), and the resulting protein solution was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow anion-exchange column (2.5 × 20 cm) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–0.6m NaCl in 25 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. Fractions (8 ml) were collected and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) for the presence of NIFS, a 44-kDa protein. Fractions containing NIFS were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 25 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4) in 0.5m ammonium sulfate. Freshly dialyzed NIFS was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column equilibrated with the same buffer. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.5–0m ammonium sulfate in 25 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4) (500 ml). NIFS was eluted in fractions at the end of the gradient. These fractions were pooled, dialyzed, concentrated, and stored at −80 °C. All NIFS assays were performed anaerobically in a reaction mixture containing 50 mmTricine·KOH1 (pH 8.0), 4 mm DTT, 8 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm Mgtitriplex (E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The enzyme activity withl-selenocysteine was measured by determination of H2Se with lead acetate as described previously (8Esaki N. Nakamura T. Tanaka M. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4386-4391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard reaction was performed with 0.5 μm NIFS using a molar turbidity coefficient of colloidal PbSe at 400 nm of 2.36 × 104 cm−1m−1. The cysteine desulfurase activity was determined by monitoring sulfide production from cysteine (13Siegel L.M. Anal. Biochem. 1965; 11: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Sulfide was measured by its conversion to methylene blue in a 1:1 mixture of 0.02 m N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulfate in 7.2m HCl and 0.03 m FeCl3 in 1.2m HCl. After color development, the absorbance at 650 nm was measured, and sulfide concentration was determined based on a standard Na2S curve. The coupled selenophosphate synthetase-NIFS protein assay was performed in the same reaction mixture described above with the following modifications: 2 mm ATP, 0.2 μCi [8-14C]ATP,10 μm selenophosphate synthetase, 5 μm NIFS were additionally added, and reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C. After 30 min, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 1.2 N HClO4followed by neutralization with KOH. The nucleotides in the supernatant solutions were separated chromatographically on cellulose-polyethyleneimine thin layer sheets developed in 1.0m formic acid and 0.5 m LiCl. Nucleotide spots identified by UV quenching were cut out, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. To detect reaction products of the coupled reaction between NIFS and selenophosphate synthetase, a coupled reaction was performed in an NMR tube under nitrogen for 3 h at 37 °C. The reaction mixture (1 ml) contained 50 mm Tricine·KOH (pH 8.0), 4 mmDTT, 8 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 2 mml-selenocysteine, 10 μmselenophosphate synthetase, and 10 mm NIFS. The NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker 500 MHz at 37 °C as described previously (1Glass R.S. Singh W.P. Jung W. Veres Z. Scholz T.D. Stadtman T.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12255-12559Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As previously reported, NIFS is a pyridoxal phosphate-containing enzyme that catalyzes the formation of l-alanine and sulfur froml-cysteine as substrate (10Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). To confirm that NIFS can also use l-selenocysteine as substrate and to compare enzyme activities on the two amino acid substrates, two types of assays were carried out. NIFS cysteine desulfurase activity was determined by monitoring the production of H2S in the methylene blue assay. Cysteine desulfurase assays were performed in the presence of DTT to keep the sulfur product reduced to H2S. The kinetic constants observed for this reaction are reported in Table I. A specific activity of 142 nmol/min/mg was determined for the NIFS reaction with l-cysteine, as well as a kcat of 6 min−1 and aV max of 2.4 nmol/min. A K mfor the substrate l-cysteine could not be determined because, at substrate concentrations as low as 10 μm, the velocity was still maximal (Fig. 1).Table IDetermination of kinetic constants for l-cysteine andl-selenocysteineSubstrateSpecific activityV maxk catK mnmol/min/mgnmol/minmin−1μml-cysteine14236NDl-selenocysteine552.42.4130Reactions with each substrate were performed anaerobically at ambient temperature.

Open table in a new tab Reactions with each substrate were performed anaerobically at ambient temperature. Each reaction mixture contained 50 mmTricine · KOH (pH 8.0), 4 mm DTT, 8 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm Mgtitriplex, and the appropriate concentration of substrate. The concentration of NIFS used in assays with l-cysteine was 0.5 μm and with l-selenocysteine was 2 μm. ND, not determined. In our assays, NIFS catalyzed the elimination of selenium froml-selenocysteine as monitored by the reaction of H2Se with lead acetate (8Esaki N. Nakamura T. Tanaka M. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4386-4391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The velocity of the NIFS catalyzed reaction with l-selenocysteine as the substrate exhibited a substrate dependence with a K m of 130 μm (Fig. 2). The specific activity of 55 nmol/min/mg and turnover number of 2.4 min−1 for l-selenocysteine are both one-third lower than the activity with l-cysteine. To determine whetherl-selenocysteine binds to the same active site asl-cysteine, cysteine desulfurase assays were carried out in the presence of varying concentrations of l-selenocysteine. As shown in Fig. 3, cysteine desulfurase activity can be inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by the addition of l-selenocysteine to the assay mixture. The addition of selenide (20 and 30 nmol) to the cysteine desulfurase assay mixture did not inhibit the cysteine desulfurase activity (data not shown). To test the ability of the NIFS protein to serve as a selenide delivery protein for selenophosphate synthetase, assays were performed in the presence of both NIFS andl-selenocysteine. As previously reported, selenophosphate synthetase catalyzes the synthesis of monoselenophosphate from selenide and ATP (2Veres Z. Kim I.Y. Scholz T.D. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10597-10603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), additional reaction products include AMP and orthophosphate. When selenide is replaced with l-selenocysteine, selenophosphate is not formed, as determined by the lack of ATP hydrolysis (Table II). However, replacement of selenide in the assay with l-selenocysteine in the presence of added NIFS protein results in the formation of AMP (Fig. 4). The amount of AMP formed is dependent on the concentration of NIFS added. In the coupled assay, when concentrations of NIFS are lower than the selenophosphate synthetase concentration, AMP production is lower as compared with the assay using selenide. However, if the concentration of NIFS is equal to or double the concentration of selenophosphate synthetase, the production of AMP is increased to almost twice the amount formed in the selenide-dependent assay.Table IIControl reactions for coupled assaysReactionnmol of AMP producedSPS + selenide + ATP8.1SPS + ATP0SPS + l-selenocysteine + ATP0SPS + NIFS + l-selenocysteine + ATP5.5SPS + NIFS + ATP0NIFS + ATP0NIFS + ATP +l-selenocysteine0Reactions were performed anaerobically at 37 °C.

In addition to monitoring the production of AMP in the coupled assay, we also determined both the amount of H2Se produced and its rate of formation by NIFS in the coupled enzyme system. When selenophosphate synthetase is present, the amount of H2Se produced is increased by 35%. The rate of elimination of selenium froml-selenocysteine increases, as well, from 6.1 to 9.5 nmol/min (Fig. 5). The presence of selenophosphate synthetase in the assay may activate NIFS towardl-selenocysteine. In contrast, in standard selenophosphate synthetase assays performed, with the addition of NIFS, using H2Se as substrate, no increase in either the rate or the amount of AMP product formed was observed (data not shown). To directly observe the products generated by selenophosphate synthetase in the presence of NIFS and l-selenocysteine, reaction products were analyzed by 31P-NMR. As shown in Fig. 6, products formed in the coupled selenophosphate synthetase and NIFS assay from ATP andl-selenocysteine produced 31P chemical resonances expected for AMP, inorganic phosphate, and selenophosphate. Additional spectra were obtained for NIFS + ATP +l-selenocysteine as well as selenophosphate synthetase +l-selenocysteine + ATP. Both reactions did not produce the expected 31P chemical resonance for selenophosphate (data not shown). Because of the chemical similarity between selenium and sulfur, enzymes that metabolize sulfur compounds frequently demonstrate similar activities with the selenium analogs of their natural substrates (9Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yosimura T. Soda K. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22417-22424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It has been shown in recent studies with cysteine sulfinate desulfinase isolated from E. coli that the enzyme exhibits both selenocysteine lyase and cysteine desulfurase activities (9Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yosimura T. Soda K. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22417-22424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Moreover, previous work on the A. vinelandii NIFS protein demonstrated that NIFS can act on both l-cysteine andl-selenocysteine (10Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we characterized in more detail the enzymatic decomposition ofl-selenocysteine by the NIFS protein. Our studies confirm the work by Zheng et al., 1993 showing that the protein can utilize both l-cysteine andl-selenocysteine as substrates (10Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Our kinetic values indicate the enzyme favors l-cysteine as a substrate over its selenium analog (Table I). This is not surprising because NIFS has been shown to have a biologically significant role in the biosynthesis of Fe-S clusters (11Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). A specific activity for l-cysteine of 142 nmol/min/mg, compared with 55 nmol/min/mg forl-selenocysteine was determined. An interesting aspect of our characterization of NIFS was that even at l-cysteine concentrations as low as 10 μm, the rate of the cysteine desulfurase activity remains at the V max. The independence of the determined velocity of the cysteine desulfurase activity on substrate concentration, indicating a very high desulfurase rate, makes the determination of K m more difficult. Our determined specific activity as well as the inability to determine a K m for l-cysteine differs from the previous results (10Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 11Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) in which a specific activity of 70 nmol/min/mg and a K m of 75 μm for the substrate l-cysteine were reported. These investigators suggest NIFS activity is highly sensitive to both pH and temperature, which affects the determined K m and specific activity values(11). Based on the studies of Zheng et al. (11Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) and Flint (14Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with the E. coli NIFS protein, it was proposed that in the NIFS catalyzed reaction a sulfhydryl group, from an active site cysteine, acts as a nucleophile in the mobilization of sulfur from thel-cysteine substrate. Flint suggests that after sulfur is transferred to NIFS, creating a persulfide on the active site cysteine, catalysis stops or slows down until this sulfane sulfur is removed by an uncharacterized pathway. This would account for the relatively low turnover number for the enzyme. When assays are performed in the presence of DTT, as in this report, the rate-limiting sulfane sulfur undergoes nucleophilic displacement by DTT forming H2S (14Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although the formation of a perselenide (R-S-Se−) in the NIFS reaction with l-selenocysteine has not been investigated in the present study, Zheng et al. 1994 (11Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) have proposed that the mechanism of selenocysteine lysis by NIFS is mechanistically similar to the cysteine desulfurase reaction. This is suggested by the requirement of Cys325 that was determined to be required for both activities (11Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) (Scheme FS2). Because of the high reactivity of selenide within a biological system, the overall cellular concentrations must remain relatively low. The availability of selenide delivery proteins could effectively raise the concentration of selenide in a localized region of the cell where it could be rapidly metabolized by a second enzyme. Although concentrations of free selenide may be low, selenium is present in cells at higher concentrations in other less reactive forms such as selenomethionine. For instance, bacteria, plants, and yeast have been found to synthesize the selenium-containing amino acid selenomethionine. The presence of selenium in place of the sulfur of methionine offers no altered biological function. Selenomethionine is abundant in plants, and when consumed organisms can utilize this form as readily as the natural occurring amino acid methionine by incorporating it freely into proteins (15Waschulewski I.H. Sunde R.A. J. Nutr. 1988; 118: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition to becoming incorporated into cellular proteins, selenomethionine can be catabolized to selenocysteine by the transsulfuration pathway (16Esaki N. Nakamura T. Tanaka H. Suzuki T. Morino Y. Soda K. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4492-4500Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Selenocysteine can then be metabolized by the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent selenocysteine lyase proteins to release elemental selenium. In the presence of reducing compounds, elemental selenium is reduced to selenide. This could provide an effective mechanism to maintain concentrations of selenide within the cell. In addition to the formation of selenide froml-selenocysteine, the nonenzymatic reaction of selenite with thiols, such as glutathione or cysteine, is believed to be a significant pathway for the incorporation of selenium into living cells. The reduction to elemental selenium requires the combination of thiols to selenite in a 4:1 stoichiometric ratio. Further reduction to selenide requires two additional equivalents of thiols (17Kice J.L. Lee T.W.S. Pan S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 4448-4455Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Our results clearly show the use of a selenide delivery protein can increase the turnover rate of an enzyme which utilizes selenide as a substrate (Figs. 4 and 6). The exact mechanism responsible for the increase in rate is not yet known. Possibilities include higher local concentrations of selenide in the vicinity of selenophosphate synthetase. Perhaps both proteins interact in solution, allowing direct transfer of selenide product from NIFS to selenophosphate synthetase. The precise chemical form of selenium produced in the reaction by NIFS may be an important determinant. Selenide can exist in several forms analogous to sulfane sulfur species, depending on the reaction conditions used. Thus, the product formed from NIFS may be a more optimal substrate for selenophosphate synthetase. Future experiments are now being planned to answer these questions. The essential role of NIFS in the pathway for the biosynthesis of FeS clusters cannot be disputed as one of its primary biological rolesin vivo. In the in vitro coupled assay, NIFS additionally can catalyze the elimination of selenium froml-selenocysteine as well as function as a selenide delivery protein. However, in vivo concentrations of sulfur containing compounds are on the order of a thousand times greater than their selenium analogs (18Sliwkowski M.X. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3140-3144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thus proteins such as NIFS will preferentially bind to and metabolize l-cysteine over the corresponding selenium analog l-selenocysteine. Hence, for effective selenide delivery systems to operate, enzymes which are specific for selenide compounds are required. Among such possible enzymes are selenocysteine lyases that have been identified in several organisms. Although kinetic characterization of these enzymes reveals they have relatively high K m values in vitro for their selenium containing substrates, the assay conditions used may not represent true cellular conditions where theK m may actually be lower. These enzymes may play an important role in the regulation of selenium availability in biological systems. Thus their ability in vitro to metabolize selenocysteine to alanine and selenium or selenide suggests that,in vivo, they may function as selenium delivery proteins analogous to sulfur delivery enzymes.

Mutants exhibiting an altered rate of development can provide useful insight into rate-limiting events in development (1Ambros V. Moss E.G. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 123-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). There are three classes of rapidly developing mutants in Dictyostelium: rdeA, rdeC, and regA. RdeC mutants lack a functional regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA),1 so that PKA activity is constitutive (2Simon M. Pelegrini O. Veron M. Kay R.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 171-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). PKA plays an important role in many aspects of metazoan development (3Blair S.S. Nature. 1995; 373: 656-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) as well as in learning and memory (4Abel T. Nguyen P.V. Barad M. Deuel T.A.S. Kandel E.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 615-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar), and genetic manipulation has demonstrated that it is essential for gene expression throughout development in Dictyostelium (see Ref.5Mann S.K.O. Brown J.M. Briscoe C. Parent C. Pitt G. Devreotes P.N. Firtel R.A. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 208-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar and references therein). Thus the level of PKA activity appears to have a profound influence on the rate of development in this organism. With regard to the two other classes of rapidly developing mutants, it has been reported that rdeA mutants have elevated intracellular cAMP levels during vegetative growth and possibly during development (6Coukell M.B. Chan F.K. FEBS Lett. 1980; 110: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 7Abe K. Yanagisawa K. Dev. Biol. 1983; 95: 200-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The RDEA gene product displays some homology to H2-type phosphotransferases in multicomponent signaling systems (8Chang W.-T. Thomason P.A. Gross J.D. Newell P.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The C terminus of REGA is a cAMP-phosphodiesterase (cAMP-PDE), while the N-terminal region is homologous to the well characterized response regulators of bacterial and eukaryotic two-component signaling systems (9Shaulsky G. Escalante R. Loomis W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15260-15265Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 10Loomis W.F. Shaulsky G. Wang N. J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2838-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It has therefore been proposed that RDEA activates the REGA-PDE in a multistep phosphorelay (8Chang W.-T. Thomason P.A.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2838-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).We have examined cAMP accumulation in rdeA and regA mutants to explore certain implications of this proposal. During the course of this work we discovered a novel adenylyl cyclase. Until now genes coding for two structurally distinct forms of adenylyl cyclase have been identified in Dictyostelium. The so-called aggregative enzyme (ACA) displays negligible activity in growing (vegetative) cells and accumulates early in development with a maximum at the time of aggregation. Disruption of ACAresults in a failure to aggregate (12Pitt G.S. Milona N. Borleis J. Lin K.C. Reed R.R. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1992; 69: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). ACA activity is stimulated by extracellular cAMP via a G-protein-dependent pathway and rapidly adapts (13Theibert A. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15121-15125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcripts of the other cyclase, ACG, are normally detected only during spore germination (12Pitt G.S. Milona N. Borleis J. Lin K.C. Reed R.R. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1992; 69: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). However, the enzyme can be readily assayed in vegetative cells when expressed under the control of the actin15 promoter. It is strongly stimulated by high osmolarity and functions as an osmosensor controlling spore germination (14Van Es S. Virdy K.J. Pitt G.S. Meima M. Sands T.W. Devreotes P.N. Cotter D.A. Schaap P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23623-23625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We report the identification of a novel adenylyl cyclase and present evidence for the idea that RDEA activates REGA in a multistep phosphorelay.DISCUSSIONWe have detected a novel adenylyl cyclase activity (ACB) in rdeA and regA cells that is distinct from ACA and ACG. Unlike ACA and guanylyl cyclase, ACB is not regulated by G-proteins, and unlike ACG it is not stimulated by high osmolarity. ACB is more effectively stimulated by Mg2+ than by Mn2+ ions, which is exactly the reverse of ACG, ACA, and guanylyl cyclase (12Pitt G.S. Milona N. Borleis J. Lin K.C. Reed R.R. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1992; 69: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 27Janssens P.M.W. De Jong C.C.C. Vink A.A. Van Haastert P.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4329-4335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most convincing evidence that ACB is a novel enzyme is the observation that ACB activity can be detected in lysates of the double mutant acaA/acgA in the presence of IBMX.As noted in the Introduction, it has recently been proposed that therdeA gene encodes a phosphotransferase that relays a phosphoryl group from an unknown histidine kinase to the response regulator of REGA and in so doing activates the REGA-PDE (8Chang W.-T. Thomason P.A. Gross J.D. Newell P.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 11Thomason P.A. Traynor D. Cavet G. Chang W.-T. Harwood A.J. Kay R.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2838-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Since according to that view both rdeA and regA mutants would be expected to lack this cAMP-PDE activity, our finding that ACB can be detected in intact regA and rdeA cells, but not in wild-type cells, is evidence in its favor. This inference is further supported by the finding that the cAMP-PDE inhibitor IBMX, that is known to inhibit the REGA cAMP-PDE, permits detection of a similar activity in lysates of the acaA and acaA/acgAcell lines. However a direct demonstration of phosphoryl group transfer from the RDEA to the REGA protein will be necessary before the proposed relay scheme can be accepted with confidence.The discovery of ACB may help to explain how PKA is activated in Dictyostelium. It has been shown that a number of early and late genes whose expression is dependent upon PKA can nonetheless be expressed (under appropiate conditions) in acaA cells (5Mann S.K.O. Brown J.M. Briscoe C. Parent C. Pitt G. Devreotes P.N. Firtel R.A. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 208-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar,28Schulkes C. Schaap P.

Lin K.C. Devreotes P.N. Schaap P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2172-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Since the PKA regulatory subunit has a very high affinity for cAMP (32De Gunzburg F. Part D. Guiso N. Veron M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3805-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), a low level of cAMP production by ACB could account for this even if much of the cAMP produced was degraded by the active REGA-PDE. This argument would appear to apply at least to PKA-dependent gene expression early in development, when we can be confident that ACB is present (Fig. 2). It may also apply later in development, since preliminary data suggest that ACB is present in slugs of wild-type cells. 2M. Meima and P. Schaap, unpublished results. Moreover, as mentioned, a quite low level of adenylyl cyclase activity may be sufficient to activate PKA. Mutants exhibiting an altered rate of development can provide useful insight into rate-limiting events in development (1Ambros V. Moss E.G. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 123-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). There are three classes of rapidly developing mutants in Dictyostelium: rdeA, rdeC, and regA.

Cell. 1992; 69: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). ACA activity is stimulated by extracellular cAMP via a G-protein-dependent pathway and rapidly adapts (13Theibert A. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15121-15125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcripts of the other cyclase, ACG, are normally detected only during spore germination (12Pitt G.S. Milona N. Borleis J. Lin K.C. Reed R.R. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1992; 69: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). However, the enzyme can be readily assayed in vegetative cells when expressed under the control of the actin15 promoter. It is strongly stimulated by high osmolarity and functions as an osmosensor controlling spore germination (14Van Es S. Virdy K.J. Pitt G.S. Meima M. Sands T.W. Devreotes P.N. Cotter D.A. Schaap P. J.

We report the identification of a novel adenylyl cyclase and present evidence for the idea that RDEA activates REGA in a multistep phosphorelay. DISCUSSIONWe have detected a novel adenylyl cyclase activity (ACB) in rdeA and regA cells that is distinct from ACA and ACG. Unlike ACA and guanylyl cyclase, ACB is not regulated by G-proteins, and unlike ACG it is not stimulated by high osmolarity. ACB is more effectively stimulated by Mg2+ than by Mn2+ ions, which is exactly the reverse of ACG, ACA, and guanylyl cyclase (12Pitt G.S. Milona N. Borleis J. Lin K.C. Reed R.R. Devreotes P.N.

Chem. 1989; 264: 4329-4335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most convincing evidence that ACB is a novel enzyme is the observation that ACB activity can be detected in lysates of the double mutant acaA/acgA in the presence of IBMX.As noted in the Introduction, it has recently been proposed that therdeA gene encodes a phosphotransferase that relays a phosphoryl group from an unknown histidine kinase to the response regulator of REGA and in so doing activates the REGA-PDE (8Chang W.-T.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2838-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Since according to that view both rdeA and regA mutants would be expected to lack this cAMP-PDE activity, our finding that ACB can be detected in intact regA and rdeA cells, but not in wild-type cells, is evidence in its favor. This inference is further supported by the finding that the cAMP-PDE inhibitor IBMX, that is known to inhibit the REGA cAMP-PDE, permits detection of a similar activity in lysates of the acaA and acaA/acgAcell lines. However a direct demonstration of phosphoryl group transfer from the RDEA to the REGA protein will be necessary before the proposed relay scheme can be accepted with confidence.The discovery of ACB may help to explain how PKA is activated in Dictyostelium. It has been shown that a number of early and late genes whose expression is dependent upon PKA can nonetheless be expressed (under appropiate conditions) in acaA cells (5Mann S.K.O. Brown J.M.

Part D. Guiso N. Veron M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3805-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), a low level of cAMP production by ACB could account for this even if much of the cAMP produced was degraded by the active REGA-PDE. This argument would appear to apply at least to PKA-dependent gene expression early in development, when we can be confident that ACB is present (Fig. 2). It may also apply later in development, since preliminary data suggest that ACB is present in slugs of wild-type cells. 2M. Meima and P. Schaap, unpublished results.

These enzymes convert β-d-mannuronic acid residues (M) to α-l-guluronic acid residues (G) at the polymer level in the industrially important polysaccharide alginate, leading to altered physical and immunological properties of the polymer. The reaction product of AlgE1 was found to be a mixture of blocks of continuous G residues (G-blocks) and blocks containing alternating M and G residues (MG-blocks). The enzyme is dependent on Ca2+ for activity, and only Sr2+ of those tested was able to replace Ca2+. Zn2+ blocked the activity even at low concentrations. algE1 has been divided into two parts based on the modular type of structure previously reported to be a characteristic of the secreted epimerases, and each part has been expressed in Escherichia coli. These experiments showed that AlgE1 contains two catalytic domains, AlgE1-1, which introduces both G-blocks and MG-blocks, and AlgE1-2, which only introduces MG-blocks. AlgE1-1 has a much lower specific activity than both AlgE1-2 and AlgE1. However, the two halves of AlgE1 seem to cooperate in such a way that they contribute approximately equally to the overall epimerization reaction.

Alginate is a biopolymer synthesized by brown algae and by some bacteria belonging to the genera Azotobacter and Pseudomonas (1Gorin P.A.J. Spencer T.R. Can. J. Chem. 1966; 44: 993-998Crossref Google Scholar, 2Linker A. Jones R.S. Nature. 1964; 204: 187-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 3Cote G.L. Krull L.H. Carbohydr.

It is widely used in industry due to its viscosifying and water binding capacity and the ability to form thermostable gels with divalent cations (5Onsøyen E. Carbohydrates Eur. 1996; 14: 26-31Google Scholar). It is also used for immobilization and encapsulation of cells and enzymes (6Skjåk-Bræk G. Espevik T. Carbohydrates Eur. 1996; 14: 19-25Google Scholar). All linear polymers consisting of 1,4-linked β-d-mannuronic acid (M)1 and α-l-guluronic acid (G) are designated alginate. Bacterial alginates may also be O-acetylated at the 2 and/or 3 position of the M residues (7Skjåk-Bræk G. Grasdalen H. Larsen B. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 154: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Since the M residues prefer the4C1-conformation, while G residues prefer the1C4-conformation, the relative amount and distribution of G residues have a large effect on the structure and properties of the polymers (8Smidsrød O. Draget K. Carbohydrates Eur. 1996; 14: 6-12Google Scholar). It has been found useful to view any alginate molecule as composed of three structural elements; blocks of consecutive G (G-blocks) or M residues (M-blocks) or blocks of alternating M and G residues (MG-blocks). Only polymers containing G-blocks above a certain length are able to form ionic gels, but the fraction of M in such gels affects the elasticity and pore size of the gel (8Smidsrød O. Draget K. Carbohydrates Eur. 1996; 14: 6-12Google Scholar). Algal alginates contain all three block types, and the amount and distribution of each type vary between species and between different parts of the algae (8Smidsrød O. Draget K. Carbohydrates Eur. 1996; 14: 6-12Google Scholar). Pseudomonas alginate does not contain G-blocks and is thus unable to form ionic gels (7Skjåk-Bræk G. Grasdalen H. Larsen B. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 154: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Vegetatively growing cells of Azotobacter vinelandii produce capsular alginate containing mostly M- and MG-blocks. The bacterium can also differentiate into a resting cell called cyst, in which the cell is surrounded by a Ca2+-alginate gel rich in G-blocks (9Sadoff H.L. Bacteriol. Rev. 1975; 39: 516-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike most other heteropolymers alginate is synthesized from only one sugar nucleotide, GDP-M, which is the precursor of mannuronan. The G residues are then introduced at the polymer level by the enzyme mannuronan C-5-epimerase. Genes encoding periplasmic epimerases (AlgG) have been cloned from both Pseudomonas aeruginosa and A. vinelandii (10Franklin M.J. Chitnis C.E. Gacesa P. Sonesson A. White D.C. Ohman D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Rehm B.H. Ertesvåg H. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5884-5889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition we have cloned and expressed five genes encoding a family (AlgE1–5) of secreted, calcium-dependent epimerases from A. vinelandii(12Ertesvåg H. Høidal H.K. Hals I.K. Rian A. Doseth B. Valla S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 719-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We have shown that at least two of these epimerases generate alginates with different distribution of G-residues. By controlling the expression of the epimerases, the organism can therefore potentially determine the structure of its alginate. AlgE1–5 are composed of two types of modules, one or two A-modules of 385 amino acids each, and one to seven R-modules containing about 153 amino acids each. The modules within each of the two groups are strongly related at the amino acid level (12Ertesvåg H. Høidal H.K. Hals I.K. Rian A. Doseth B. Valla S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 719-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The modular structure of AlgE1 is ARRRAR (Fig. 1). We show here that the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of this enzyme (ARRR and AR, respectively) are both enzymatically active and can be expressed separately in Escherichia coli. The ARRR polypeptide introduces a mixture of MG-blocks and G-blocks, while the AR domain only generates MG-blocks. E. coli JM109 (13Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11410) Google Scholar) was used in this study. For site-specific mutagenesis, the strain BMH71-18 mutS (Promega) was also used. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in L broth (10 g/liter tryptone, 5 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl) with shaking or on L-agar supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin when appropriate. For enzyme purifications the cells containing plasmid were grown in a medium containing 30 g/liter tryptone, 15 g/liter yeast extract, and 5 g/liter NaCl. Standard recombinant DNA procedures and protein gel electrophoresis were performed according to Sambrook et al. (14Sambrook J. Fritsh E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transformations were performed according to Chung et al. (15Chung C.T. Niemela L.S. Miller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2172-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad Coomassie Brilliant Blue based protein assay, using bovine serum albumin as standard. AlgE1 was previously expressed from the plasmid pHE16, in which translation initiation might potentially take place both from lacZ' and from the start codon in algE1 mRNA. To avoid any production of a fusion protein and to facilitate purification of the corresponding protein, we constructed an NcoI site at the start ATG of algE1 without changing the coding sequence of the gene. Site-specific mutagenesis was done by using the pSelect system from Promega Inc. using the oligonucleotide 5′-ACGTTGTAATCCATGGTCCGCTTCCTAATC-3′ (changed bases are underlined) for the mutagenesis. The gene could then be subcloned into the ATG expression vector pTrc99A (16Amann I. Ochs B. Abel K.-J. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 69: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar), generating plasmid pHH1. The plasmid encoding the first part of the protein, pHE37, was constructed by removing the last 1.8 kilobases of the gene usingStyI. The HindIII site in the polylinker was then made blunt using Klenow DNA polymerase and religated in order to minimize the C-terminal fusion. The resulting protein (AlgE1-1) has a C-terminal tail of 7 vector-encoded amino acids (STCRHAS). pHE56 encoding the second part of the protein (AlgE1-2) was constructed by replacing a 3.3-kilobase NcoI-BglII DNA fragment with a 0.8-kilobase AflIII-BglII DNA fragment generated from polymerase chain reaction amplification of the sequence encoding the second A-module of AlgE1. Polymerase chain reaction was performed using the TaKaRa LA polymerase chain reaction kit version 2, with 1 mm MgCl2 in the reaction buffer using the primers 5′-TCTTCGAGCCCGACATGTTCAATGCC-3′, binding to the start of the second A-module in AlgE1 and 5′-CTCAAGCTTAGTCGGTCCCCTGCGGCACTTC-3′, which binds to the 3′-end of the same A-module. The changed bases in the first primer are underlined, and the effect of this mutation is to introduce an AflIII site and change the start of this A-module from Val to Met. Epimerase activities were quantified by measuring the liberation of tritium from [5-3H]alginate to water as described previously (11Rehm B.H. Ertesvåg H. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5884-5889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, enzyme extracts, CaCl2, and MOPS (50 mm, pH 6.9) in a total volume of 550 μl was prewarmed at 37 °C. Fifty μl of prewarmed [5-3H]alginate (2 mg/ml in water, specific activity about 100,000 dpm/mg) was added, and the mixtures were incubated further. The reactions were stopped by adding 15 μl of NaCl (5 m) and 800 μl of isopropyl alcohol and incubated at −50 °C for at least 15 min. After centrifugation for 30 min, the radioactivity in 1 ml of the supernatant was measured in a liquid scintillation analyzer. Reaction mixtures containing no enzyme were used as blanks, and all reactions were performed in duplicate. The incubation times and quantities of enzyme were varied to ascertain that the measurements were within the linear part of the assay. CaCl2 was added at a concentration of 3 mm unless otherwise stated. The epimerizations of alginate for NMR spectroscopy were performed using 7.5 mg of unlabeled alginate in a volume of 6 ml of the same buffer, the concentrations of CaCl2 are stated for each experiment. Desired degrees of epimerization were achieved by varying the amount of enzyme or the incubation time. To investigate the activity of the epimerases on MG-blocks, alginates which had been epimerized by AlgE4 to FG = 40, FGG = 0, and then purified, were used (MG-alginate). NMR spectroscopy was performed using a Bruker AM300 (300 MHz) spectrometer, and FG, FM, FGG, FMM, and FGM,MG was calculated from the integrated spectra as described earlier (17Grasdalen H. Larsen B. Smidsrød O. Carbohydr. Res. 1979; 68: 23-31Crossref Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Labeled and unlabeled alginate was prepared from P. aeruginosa (11Rehm B.H. Ertesvåg H. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5884-5889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and contained less than 5% G (M-alginate). An overnight culture was inoculated in fresh, prewarmed medium at 1% concentration. The culture was induced with isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration 0.5 mm) after 3 h and grown for an 4 additional hours before harvesting. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in one-tenth of the initial volume in 20 mm MOPS (pH 6.9), 10 mm CaCl2. They were then disrupted by sonication, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter and applied to an ion-exchange column (Pharmacia HiTrapQ) equilibrated with 20 mm MOPS (pH 6.9), 5 mm CaCl2. Proteins were eluted by a continuous NaCl gradient (0–1 m) in the same buffer, and fractions containing epimerase activity were adjusted to 1 m(NH4)2SO4 and applied to a hydrophobic interaction column (Pharmacia HiTrap Phenyl-Sepharose High Performance) equilibrated with 20 mm MOPS (pH 6.9), 5 mm CaCl2, and 1 m(NH4)2SO4. The epimerases were eluted by a continuous gradient of (NH4)2SO4 (1–0 m) in 20 mm MOPS (pH 6.9), 5 mm CaCl2. Fractions displaying epimerase activity were then gel filtrated through a Pharmacia Sephacryl S200 column equilibrated with 20 mmMOPS (pH 6.9), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2. Based on the modular structure analysis AlgE1 can be described as a fusion of an AlgE2-like (lacking one R-module) and an AlgE4-like epimerase (12Ertesvåg H. Høidal H.K. Hals I.K. Rian A. Doseth B. Valla S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 719-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), and it therefore seemed possible that AlgE1 contained two separate epimerase activities. To test this hypothesis we constructed two plasmids, pHE37 and pHE56, expressing the AlgE2 and AlgE4-like proteins AlgE1-1 and AlgE1-2, respectively. The constructs were, like that for AlgE1, based on the expression vector pTrc99A. AlgE1-1 was made such that its N terminus is the same as that of AlgE1, while the C terminus contains the 5 first amino acids of the second A-module followed by 7 vector-encoded amino acids. AlgE1-2 starts at the second A-module, except that the first amino acid was changed from Val to Met (Fig. 1). The C-terminal end is identical to that of AlgE1. The three plasmids were used for expression of AlgE1 and its two truncated derivatives AlgE1-1 and AlgE1-2, and the corresponding crude extracts were used for analysis of epimerase activities. These measurements showed that all three proteins are catalytically active (Table I). It was therefore clear that AlgE1 is a bifunctional enzyme, and that the activities of each part could be analyzed separately.Table IPurification of AlgE1, AlgE1–1, and AlgE1–2Total proteinTotal activitySpecific activityRecoveryPurificationmgunitunit1-aOne unit is defined as the amount of enzyme needed to epimerize 1 μmol of substrate (sugar residues) in 1 min. mg%foldAlgE1 Crude extract557.50.141001 Ion exchange2.611.24.314932 Hydrophobic1.57.34.99736 Gel filtration1.25.74.97636AlgE1–1 Crude extract460.960.0211001 Ion exchange3.90.420.11445.2 Hydrophobic1.70.0240.0142.50.67 Gel filtration0.420.1550.371618AlgE1–2 Crude extract76.52.60.0341001 Ion exchange0.391.022.63976 Hydrophobic0.110.918.235237 Gel filtration0.110.484.4181281-a One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme needed to epimerize 1 μmol of substrate (sugar residues) in 1 min. Open table in a new tab Initial biochemical characterization of AlgE1 showed that this enzyme displayed a maximum activity at pH 6.9, and at a temperature close to 37 °C (results not shown). These conditions were used throughout the study for all three enzymes. AlgE1 displayed the highest specific activity in the crude extracts (0.14 units/mg of total protein), while the other two had fairly similar specific activities (Table I). Interestingly, this did not correlate well with the amount of protein expressed, since SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2, lanes 1, 3, and 5) demonstrated that the expression level of AlgE1-2 is rather low. These data therefore indicated that the specific activity of purified AlgE1-1 must be low compared with those of whole AlgE1 and AlgE1-2. The three enzymes were purified by the use of three column chromatography steps. In the first step (ion exchange) the specific activities increased strongly for AlgE1 and AlgE1-2 (Table I). In the next step (hydrophobic interaction) the specific activities increased strongly for AlgE1-2 and slightly for AlgE1, while it was severely reduced in the case of AlgE1-1. This reduction is due to the particularly high sensitivity of this enzyme to ions carried over from the elution buffer (see below). During the final step (gel filtration) the activity of AlgE1-1 was restored, while the specific activity of AlgE1-2 was reduced. The reduction in specific activity may be caused by some degree of enzyme inactivation, but we still decided to keep this step since SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that some minor contaminating proteins were removed (results not shown). The purification ranged from a factor of 36 (AlgE1-1) to a factor of 128 (AlgE1-2), and the purity of the final fractions were found to be satisfactory for further biochemical characterization in all three cases (Fig. 2, lanes 2, 4, and 7). The specific activities of the purified AlgE1 and AlgE1-2 were similar, while the specific activity of AlgE1-1 was an order of magnitude lower (Table I). We tried to obtain values for the kinetic parameters, but the K m of all three enzymes seemed to be too close to the present detection limit of the assay (6 × 10−6m) to obtain reliable results. The values obtained for the reaction rates in these experiments indicated that the maximal rates were reached already at a substrate concentration of about 1 × 10−4m and that the reaction was not significantly inhibited at the substrate concentrations used in the standard assay (results not shown). This implies that the specific activities shown in Table I are proportional to thek cat of each enzyme. The molecular masses of the epimerases seemed to be somewhat higher based on the SDS-PAGE compared with the values deduced from the DNA sequences (162, 97, and 77 kDa compared to 147, 89, and 59 kDa for AlgE1, AlgE1-1, and AlgE1-2, respectively). This is similar to what has been previously observed for an AlgE-epimerase isolated from A. vinelandii (18Ertesvåg H. Doseth B. Larsen B. Skjåk-Bræk G. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2846-2853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and thus probably is not related to expression of the protein in a foreign host. It has been reported that calcium-binding proteins may migrate aberrantly in SDS-PAGE gels, but that the relative migration rates can be changed by adding calcium to the sample buffer (19Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). In our case, however, the apparent molecular masses of the three proteins were not affected by addition of 1 mm CaCl2 or 1.7 mmNa2EDTA to the sample buffer, gel, and separation buffer (results not shown). The purified AlgE1 (lane 2) still shows two bands on the gel. We have observed that several of the epimerases are seen as multiple bands on denaturing gels, although in the present case the possibility of a contaminating protein has not been ruled out. During purification of the enzymes we observed that the activities might be strongly affected by the presence of the NaCl and (NH4)2SO4 used in the protocol. These effects were therefore analyzed more systematically. The data in Fig. 3 A show that a concentration between 100 and 200 mm NaCl was optimal for AlgE1. AlgE1-1, on the other hand, is much more sensitive to high ionic strengths than whole AlgE1, but also compared with AlgE1-2. Because of the shapes of the different activity curves there is actually no concentration that is near optimal for all three enzymes. The effects of (NH4)2SO4 seemed to be quite dramatic during the purification of AlgE1-1. As can be seen from Fig. 3 B, the activity of all three enzymes is quite sensitive to this salt. Note that a concentration of about 30 mm exerts a very significant stimulatory effect on AlgE1 and AlgE1-2, while the same concentration strongly represses the activity of AlgE1-1. When the activity data from the purification of AlgE1-1 were adjusted for the positive effects of NaCl and the negative effects of (NH4)2SO4, the enzyme preparations from the hydrophobic column and the gel filtration column both have a total activity of 0.11 units. This therefore also explains the apparently very low specific activity obtained for AlgE1-1 after the hydrophobic interaction chromatography step. It has long been known that the secreted A. vinelandii epimerases need Ca2+ for activity, and that different enzymes probably have different requirements for this ion. We therefore decided to study the influence of calcium on AlgE1 and its derivatives. The optimal concentration of Ca2+ for AlgE1 activity was found to be 0.8 mm (Fig. 3 C). At 0.05 mm CaCl2 no activity was detected, while 0.35 mm was required to obtain 50% of the maximal activity. At concentrations above optimum the activities were somewhat, but not severely, reduced. The data in Fig. 3 C also show that the Ca2+ requirement of AlgE1-1 is much higher (optimum around 3 mm) than that of whole AlgE1, while AlgE1-2 needs slightly more Ca2+ than AlgE1 for optimal activity. It is also interesting to note that the slope of the AlgE1-1 curve is steep up to about 25% of maximal activity (0.2 mmCa2+), and then is much more moderate at higher Ca2+ concentrations. AlgE1-1 therefore has a higher relative activity than AlgE1-2 at low concentrations of calcium. The purification data shown in Table I were all determined in the presence of 3 mm Ca2+, and this may have led to an underestimation of the activities during purification for AlgE1 and to a lesser extent also for AlgE1-2. In the presence of the Ca2+ chelator Na2EDTA, AlgE1 activity was, as expected, severely reduced or blocked. Still, as long as the molar Na2EDTA concentration was kept below that of Ca2+, the enzyme activity was not eliminated. It is therefore clear that the inhibitory effect of Na2EDTA is directly caused by its ability to bind divalent cations. Interestingly, Sr2+ was able to substitute for Ca2+, although the activity was not fully restored (results not shown). At Ca2+ concentrations lower than optimum, the addition of Sr2+ or Mg2+ had a stimulatory effect (Fig. 4), but Mg2+ is not able to substitute for Ca2+ when no calcium is added (results not shown). These results are in accordance with those found by Haug and Larsen (20Haug A. Larsen B. Carbohydr. Res. 1971; 17: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) for a mixture of epimerases isolated from A. vinelandii. Both Mn2+ and Zn2+ exert a negative effect on enzyme activity, the effect of Zn2+being strongly negative even at rather low concentrations (0.1 mm). The monomer sequence distribution of the epimerase reaction products were determined by NMR spectroscopy. The results showed that AlgE1 is able to introduce both G-blocks and MG-blocks into its substrate (Fig. 5 A). The properties of AlgE1 therefore seem to include those previously reported for both AlgE2 and AlgE4 (12Ertesvåg H. Høidal H.K. Hals I.K. Rian A. Doseth B. Valla S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 719-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 18Ertesvåg H. Doseth B. Larsen B. Skjåk-Bræk G. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2846-2853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of the Ca2+-concentration on the epimerization pattern was also analyzed, and the results showed that the relative amount of G-blocks at a given FG increases with decreasing amount of calcium down to 0.4 mm (Fig. 6). Furthermore, as the degree of epimerization increases at a given Ca2+-concentration (0.4 and 3.0 mm tested), the relative frequency of G-blocks increases (Fig. 6). This increase is presumably due to elongation of pre-existing G-blocks as the reaction proceeds. The addition of 100 mm NaCl to the epimerization reaction did not significantly alter the relative content of G-blocks and MG-blocks (Table II, samples 2 and 3).Figure 6The effect of FG and Ca2+ on the G-block content of alginates epimerized by AlgE1. +, 0.2 mm Ca2+; ■, 0.4 mm Ca2+; ×, 0.9 mmCa2+; •, 3 mm Ca2+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IINMR spectroscopy of in vitro epimerized alginatesSampleEnzymeFGFGGFGMFGG/FGMComments1AlgE10.2940.1030.1910.5420.2640.1370.1271.080.4 mm Ca2+, 100 mm NaCl30.4830.2530.2291.10100 mm NaCl40.4210.0300.391MG-alginate5AlgE1–10.1890.0960.0931.0360.2920.1690.1231.3770.4890.3580.1312.780.4560.0590.397MG-alginate9AlgE1–20.29300.2930100.34800.3480110.40500.405MG-alginate12AlgE1–1 + AlgE1–20.2940.0730.2210.33—2-aEquimolar amounts of AlgE1–1 and AlgE1–2, 16 times less AlgE1–1 than in sample 5 and half the amount of AlgE1–2 as compared to sample 9.130.3510.1210.2300.53—2-bTwice as much of each enzyme as in sample 12.The NMR experiments were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures” using 3.0 mm CaCl2, no added NaCl, and M-alginate as substrate unless otherwise stated in the comments column.2-a Equimolar amounts of AlgE1–1 and AlgE1–2, 16 times less AlgE1–1 than in sample 5 and half the amount of AlgE1–2 as compared to sample 9.2-b Twice as much of each enzyme as in sample 12. Open table in a new tab The NMR experiments were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures” using 3.0 mm CaCl2, no added NaCl, and M-alginate as substrate unless otherwise stated in the comments column. A similar analysis carried out with AlgE1-1 and AlgE1-2 showed that AlgE1-1 introduces G into both G-blocks and MG-blocks, with a preference for G-blocks (Fig. 5 B), while AlgE1-2 only generates MG-blocks (Fig. 5 C). Thus it can be concluded that each catalytic center in AlgE1 catalyzes the formation of very different alginate structures, and that AlgE1-2 displays an activity that is very similar to that of AlgE4. The frequency of G-blocks in the reaction product of whole AlgE1 is quite high despite the very low specific activity of the part apparently responsible for this activity (AlgE1-1). The simplest explanation for this inconsistency is probably that the catalytic efficiencies of the two separate halves of the enzyme are different from their activities in the fused polypetide (AlgE1). We also mixed equimolar quantities of AlgE1-1 and AlgE1-2 and measured the monomer sequence distribution in the corresponding reaction product (Table II, samples 12 and 13). Interestingly, the relative frequency of G-blocks is higher than one would expect from the specific activity of each enzyme. It is not clear whether this indicates that the activities of the two enzymes are influenced by the presence of each other, or that the product of one enzyme is a more favored substrate for the other than is the original substrate. Another interesting question is whether the enzyme is able to epimerize M residues flanked by G residues. To analyze this problem we incubated an AlgE4 reaction product containing only M-blocks (20%) and MG-blocks (80%) with the three enzymes. AlgE1-2 was not able to epimerize this substrate further, while AlgE1 and AlgE1-1 were able to introduce some G-residues as G-blocks (Table II, samples 4, 8, and 11). Since the fraction of GM did not decrease, the enzymes do not seem to be able to epimerize the M in the triad GMG. The results presented in this report clearly demonstrate that AlgE1 has two active centers, one generating MG-blocks only, while the second preferentially generates G-blocks. AlgE1 therefore can be considered functionally as a fusion of an AlgE2-like and an AlgE4-like protein, except that AlgE1-1 introduces a higher proportion of MG-blocks than AlgE2 (12Ertesvåg H. Høidal H.K. Hals I.K. Rian A. Doseth B. Valla S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 719-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A. vinelandii might need such an epimerase to synthesize alginate containing a mixture of G-blocks and MG-blocks. This may be more difficult to achieve if two separate enzymes, each introducing different types of block structures, were used. One might also envision that the G-blocks in the reaction product of AlgE1 function as junction zones in a gel network, while the other block types serve as elastic elements between the cross-links. At low concentrations of Ca2+ the average length of the G-blocks needs to be higher to maintain a constant gel strength (21Skjåk-Bræk G. Martinsen A. Guiry M.D. Blunden G. Seaweed Resources in Europe: Uses and Potential. John Wiley & Sons, New York1991: 219-257Google Scholar). Interestingly, AlgE1 introduces relatively more G-blocks when the concentration of Ca2+ is 0.4 mm than when it is 3 mm. This could be caused by a shift in the relative activity of the two functional units when the concentration of Ca2+ is changed. The data in Fig. 3 C are consistent with this hypothesis, since they indicate that the N-terminal half of AlgE1 displays relatively more activity at low concentrations of Ca2+ than the C-terminal part. When G-block forming epimerases are used to epimerize alginates, it is always a problem that aggregates of alginate molecules cross-linked with Ca2+ are formed. Since the binding of Ca2+competes with the binding of Na+ and Mg+, neither of which is able to cross-link G-blocks, addition of sufficient amounts of these cations to the reaction mixture should theoretically reduce this problem. The results shown in Fig. 3 A show that AlgE1 actually is activated by up to 200 mm NaCl, while AlgE1-1 tolerates only up to 100 mm NaCl. The addition of NaCl does not seem to influence the epimerization pattern of AlgE1. Since in addition the concentration of Ca2+ needed for full activity can be lowered when Mg2+ is added (Fig. 4), it should be possible to compose a reaction buffer which ensures both high activity and that a higher FGG can be reached before the problem of aggregation occurs. The results also seem to suggest that Ca2+ has two different functions in the reaction, and that one of those are more ion-specific than the other. The first part of the epimerization reaction is proposed to be neutralization of the negatively charged mannuronic acid residue (22Gacesa P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 199-202Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Any cation bound to the alginate would be expected to make this step easier. The epimerases contain sequences homologous to known calcium-binding motifs (11Rehm B.H. Ertesvåg H. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5884-5889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus the enzyme probably needs to bind either Ca2+ or Sr2+ to be active, with Ca2+ being the preferred ion. The data seem to suggest that AlgE1-1 has a much lower specific activity alone than when it is part of the whole enzyme, while this is not the case for AlgE1-2. This may be caused by incorrect folding since the C terminus of AlgE1-1 is not similar to the termini of the epimerases found in A. vinelandii. The NMR spectra obtained by using a mixture of AlgE1-1 and AlgE1-2 seem, on the other hand, to indicate that mixing of the two halves stimulates the activity of AlgE1-1. It is therefore possible that the two halves can associate with each other and that this interaction is necessary for full activity of the first part. It may also be that AlgE1-1 needs pre-existing G-residues to be able to epimerize efficiently. It should then be expected that the relative amount of G-blocks introduced by AlgE1 increases with increasing FG, and this is consistent with the data in Fig. 6. The experiments using MG-alginate as substrate suggest that AlgE1 and AlgE1-1 are able to epimerize mannuronic acid residues which are not accessible to AlgE1-2. This could imply that they are able to use smaller M-blocks as substrate, perhaps because they are able to epimerize an M next to a G. However, since the epimerization capacity is quite low on this substrate, the smallest accessible M-block must consist of more than one residue, probably also more than two. AlgE1 is therefore not able to convert MG-blocks to G-blocks. As part of an attempt to better understand the biological function of the epimerases in A. vinelandii, it will be necessary to analyze the structures and properties of the reaction products of all the enzymes. It seems very probable that the need for varying the physical properties of the alginates is related both to the vegetative and cyst state of the cells. By also carrying out expression studies of the epimerase genes under different environmental conditions, combined with gene knock-out studies, it should eventually be possible to understand the major aspects of this rather unique biological system. Experiments along these lines have therefore been initiated in our laboratory. We thank Wenche Iren Strand for analyzing the NMR spectra."
https://openalex.org/W1994864539,"Epithelial ovarian tumors frequently display deletions on the short arm of chromosome 3 suggesting the existence of tumor suppressor genes within the deleted regions. We have recently established a primary tissue culture system as a model to investigate the genetic events associated with ovarian cancer. The frequencies of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 16 loci representative of chromosome 3p in 33 tumor biopsies and 47 ovarian primary cultures derived from unselected ovarian cancers were examined. This repertoire also included benign and borderline tumors as well as malignant ovarian ascites. LOH was observed in 25 (31%) samples for at least one marker: 21 of 58 malignant, two of 12 borderline and two of 10 benign specimens. Chromosome 3p loss was not restricted to ovarian tumors of high grade and stage. LOH was observed in both cultured and non cultured tumors and ascites. A spontaneously immortalized cell line derived from a malignant ovarian ascites, OV-90, displayed LOH of the majority of markers suggesting loss of one homolog of chromosome 3p. The pattern of deletion displayed by these 25 samples enabled the determination of at least two distinct regions of overlapping deletions on chromosome 3p extending from D3S1270 to D3S1597 and from D3S1293 to D3S1283. In addition, a region proximal to D3S1300 was deleted in a subset of samples. Although loss of loci overlapping these three regions (Regions I, II and III) were observed in malignant and benign tumors, in borderline tumors loss was observed of markers representative of Region III only. While RARβ is presently included in Region II, the minimal regions of deletion exclude VHL, TGFBR2, PTPaseγ and FHIT as candidate tumor suppressors in ovarian tumorigenesis."

Adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) plays a central role in cell physiology, for example as an energy source and as part of signal transduction cascades involving phosphorylation of proteins. However, the conformation of ATP under physiological conditions is not clear, and several different conformations of ATP have been reported. X-ray crystal analysis of Na2ATP showed that the adenine base issyn oriented toward the ribose moiety when the crystal contains eight ATP molecules, sixteen sodium ions and twenty-four water molecules in a unit cell (1Kennard O. Isaacs N.W. Coppola J.C. Kirby A.J. Warren S. Motherwell W.D.S. Watson D.G. Wampler D.L. Chenery D.H. Larson A.C. Ann Kerr K. Rivia Di Sanseverino L.

It has been reported that thesyn and anti orientations are present in equal proportions in the absence of monovalent and divalent cations at neutral pH, but that the adenine base shifted to the antiorientation in the presence of Mg2+ as determined using1H, 13C and 31P NMR (2Son T.-D.

This was most probably because of an ionic interaction between Mg2+ and the β- and γ-phosphates of ATP. Theanti orientation of the base toward the ribose moiety was also shown in ATP-Mg2+-enzyme complexes (7Leatherbarrow R.J. Fersht A.R. Winter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7840-7844Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 8Milburn M.V. Tong L. de Vos A.M. Brunger A. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Kim S.H. Science. 1990; 247: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is clear that the conformation of ATP is strongly influenced by cations, and such a conformational restriction of ATP by cations is probably important for efficient recognition of ATP by some enzymes. Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine), which are divalent and polyvalent cations, are important for cell growth and are present at millimolar concentrations, comparable with the concentrations of ATP and Mg2+ in animal cells (9Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3228) Google Scholar, 10Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 759-774PubMed Google Scholar). It is also known that polyamines can interact with ATP (11Watanabe S. Kusama-Eguchi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20803-20809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Nakai C. Glinsmann W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5636-5641Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 13Günther T. Vormann J. Konstanczak P. Schäfer A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1192: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of physiological concentrations of K+ and Mg2+ the interaction between spermine (or spermidine) and ATP is weak, and it was thought that polyamines compete with Mg2+ for binding to ATP (11Watanabe S. Kusama-Eguchi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20803-20809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Nakai C. Glinsmann W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5636-5641Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that polyamines interact with an ATP-Mg2+ complex as well as with ATP (13Günther T. Vormann J. Konstanczak P. Schäfer A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1192: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thus, we have carried out experiments to study in detail the physico-chemical characteristics of the ATP-Mg2+-spermine complex and the physiological significance of this complex. We found that some biological reactions involving ATP and Mg2+ are enhanced by an anti oriented ternary complex containing ATP, Mg2+, and spermine. ATP was dissolved in water and NaOH was added to adjust pH to 7. Then sample solutions (0.4 ml), containing 3 mm ATP, 10 mm Tris-d11 (>99 atom %D)-HCl, pH 7.8, in the absence or presence of 3 mmMg2+, were prepared. The solutions were evaporated to dryness in vacuo and redissolved in 0.1 ml D2O (99.85 atom %D). The solution was evaporated again and dissolved in the original volume of D2O (99.996 atom D%). Spermine titrations were performed by adding microliter amounts of 0.1m spermine in D2O directly to the sample in a 5-mm NMR tube. All spectra were taken using a Bruker DRX500 spectrometer at the operating frequency of 500 MHz for 1H and a probe temperature of 298 K. The operation conditions for one-dimensional spectra were as follows: sweep width, 6 kHz; data points, 32,000; and acquisitions, 40. The coupling constant3 J H1′H2′ was obtained from the splitting of the H1′ resonance, whereas the coupling constant3 J H3′H4′ was not clearly determined. The value of 3 J H1′H2′ +3 J H3′H4′ was therefore assumed to be equal to 10 Hz as found for a number of nucleotides, and the fractional populations of the C2′-endo conformer and the C3′-endo conformer were obtained with the formulas [C2′-endo] =3 J H1′H2′/(3 J H1′H2′+ 3 J H3′H4′) and [C3′-endo] = 1 − [C2′-endo] (14Altona C. Sundaralingam M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1973; 95: 2333-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional double quantum filtered-chemical shift correlated spectroscopy, and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) 1NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode. For all two-dimensional experiments, 512 free induction decays of 2,000 data points were collected by using the states-TPPI (time proportional phase incrementation) method (15Ernst R.R. Bodenhausen G. Wokaun A. Principles of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance in One and Two Dimensions. Clarendon Press, Oxford, UK1987: 336-346Google Scholar), and spectra of 1,000 × 2,000 were obtained with zero-filling, after which a two-dimensional Fourier transformation with π/2 shifted squared sine-bell window function for F2 dimension and π/2 shifted sine-bell window function for F1 dimension was performed. The mixing time for NOESY measurement was 500 ms. 31P NMR experiments were performed with a 31P frequency of 202.46 MHz at a probe temperature of 298 K. All31P spectra were recorded by using 45° pulse without proton decoupling. The operation conditions were as follows: pulse repetition delay, 0.5 s; sweep width, 7 kHz; data points, 8 k; and acquisitions, 512. Before the fast Fourier transformation an exponential multiplication (line broadening factor of 3 Hz) was applied. Chemical shifts were indicated by ppm from the signal of H3PO4 as an external standard. The binding constant in the presence of 100 mm K+ was determined by the spectrophotometric resin competition procedure of Jenkins (16Jenkins W.T. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 145: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) with some modifications (11Watanabe S. Kusama-Eguchi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20803-20809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of ATP to cationic resin and to cations is a competitive interaction. 20 mg of AG1 × 2 (200–400 mesh, Bio-Rad) were used as a cationic resin. The resin, ATP (100 μm), and various amounts of spermine and/or Mg2+ were added in 50 ml of Buffer I (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 mm KCl). Absorbance at 260 nm (A 260) was measured after stirring for 30 min at room temperature. When the binding constant of spermine for ATP-Mg2+ or Mg2+ for ATP-spermine was determined, 1 mm Mg2+ or 2 mmspermine was included in Buffer I, so that more than 85% of 100 μm ATP can make a complex with Mg2+ or spermine. PotA, a spermidine uptake protein that has ATPase activity, was purified to homogeneity as described previously (17Kashiwagi K. Endo H. Kobayashi H. Takio K. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25377-25382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (0.025 ml) for ATPase activity containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 40 to 60 cpm/pmol), and 0.5 μg of purified PotA, was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. The released 32Pi was measured by the method of Lill et al. (18Lill R. Cunningham K. Brundage L.A. Ito K. Oliver D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis to examine whether spermine binds to ATP or enzyme was performed according to the method of Dixson and Webb (19Dixson M. Webb E.C. Enzyme. 3rd Ed. Longman Group Ltd., London, UK1979: 381-399Google Scholar). Protein kinase A activity was measured by the method of Denis et al. (20Denis C.L. Kemp B.E. Zoller M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17932-17935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (0.05 ml) containing 50 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 800–1,200 cpm/pmol), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 160 μm kemptide (amino acid sequence; LRRASLG), and 0.01 milliunits of protein kinase A, catalytic subunit (Boehringer Mannheim), was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Phosphorylated kemptide was collected on P81 filter (Whatman), and the radioactivity was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Intracellular concentrations of ATP and polyamines are 2 mm or more in bovine lymphocytes and rat liver (11Watanabe S. Kusama-Eguchi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20803-20809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, NMR experiments were performed using 3 mm ATP, Mg2+, and spermine under standard conditions. The31P signals of α-, β-, and γ-phosphates of ATP in the presence of Mg2+ appeared at −10.5, −18.8, and −5.2 ppm, respectively. When spermine was added, the β-phosphate resonance broadened significantly and the γ-phosphate resonance also broadened (Fig. 1). This broadening probably indicates that the conformation around the β-phosphate is exchanging slowly. In contrast, in the presence of 3 mm spermine and absence of Mg2+, the signals of all three phosphates remained sharp, although a slight change of chemical shifts was observed compared with those without spermine (Fig. 2, A and B). Thus, a significant conformational change of ATP by spermine was observed only in the presence of Mg2+. The change of 31P spectra of ATP was almost identical under the conditions Tris-DCl (pH 7.8), D2O (pH 7.0), and D2O (pH 7.8). In contrast, under acidic conditions (pH 3.3), the chemical shifts of α-, β-, and γ-phosphates of ATP in the presence of Mg2+ were not changed significantly during titration with spermine. Spectra recorded in the absence and presence of 3 mm spermine are shown in Fig. 2, C and D. The results suggest that a ternary complex of ATP, Mg2+, and spermine is formed at neutral pH but not at acidic pH.Figure 231 P NMR spectra of ATP. 31P NMR experiments were performed using 3 mmATP in D2O under the conditions at pH 7.8 (A), in the presence of 3 mm spermine at pH 7.8 (B), 3 mm Mg2+ at pH 3.3 (C), and 3 mm each Mg2+ and spermine at pH 3.3 (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We further investigated how spermine interacts with an ATP-Mg2+ complex. The 1H NMR signals of ATP and spermine, in a solution containing ATP, Mg2+, and spermine (3 mm each) at pH 7.8, were assigned by the analysis of double quantum filtered-chemical shift correlated spectroscopy and NOESY spectra. Each of the 1H signals of spermine showed little change following the addition of Mg2+ or ATP-Mg2+ (data not shown), suggesting that spermine interaction with β- and γ-phosphates of ATP does not influence the conformation of adenosine moiety. In the NOESY spectra, intramolecular NOE cross peaks were observed only between adjacent protons of spermine, i.e. 1,1′/2,2′, 2,2′/3,3′, and 4,4′/5,5′ (Fig. 3 A), indicating that upon the interaction with ATP, spermine exists primarily in a linear conformation, as was reported for the conformation of spermidine in the PotD-spermidine complex (21Sugiyama S. Vassylyev D.G. Matsushima M. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Morikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9519-9525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Only weak intermolecular NOE cross peaks between H1,1′/3,3′ signals of spermine and H8, H5′/5"" of ATP were observed for the NOESY spectrum recorded at 10 °C, indicating that spermine mainly interacts with the phosphate groups of the ATP-Mg2+ complex (data not shown). As for ATP in the complex, strong NOE between H8 and H2′ was observed, whereas NOE between H8 and H3′ was less strong (Fig. 3 B). Only weak NOE between H8 and H1′ was observed for the NOESY spectrum. These results indicate that the glycosidic bond adopts ananti conformation in the ATP-Mg2+-spermine complex at neutral pH, similar to the conformation seen in the binary ATP-Mg2+ complex. The three-bond coupling,3 J H1′H2′, in the ribose moiety of the ATP-Mg2+-spermine complex was observed at 5.6 Hz in the1H NMR spectra, whereas the value in the ATP-Mg2+ binary complex was at 6.0 Hz. Thus, the fractional populations of the C2′-endo conformer and the C3′-endo conformer were only slightly affected by the formation of the complex (from 60 to 56%). In addition, the chemical shifts of only H5′ and H5"" in the ribose moiety were changed by the addition of spermine (Fig. 4). These results confirm that spermine binds to the phosphate groups rather than adenine or ribose moiety of ATP. Fig. 5 shows the relative intensity of 31P signals of β- and γ-phosphates to α-phosphate, whose signal is constant during the spermine titration. The titration curve showed that the saturation of both the β- and γ-phosphate signals of ATP occurred at approximately 2:1 molar ratio of ATP-Mg2+ to spermine. This value is consistent with the charge ratio at neutral condition; −2 for ATP-Mg2+ and +4 for spermine. The binding constants of spermine and Mg2+for ATP were determined in the presence of 100 mmK+ at pH 7.5 by the spectrophotometric resin competition procedure. The binding constants of spermine and Mg2+ for ATP were 2.70 × 103m−1 and 6.94 × 103m−1, respectively (Fig. 6, A and B). Thus, the affinity of Mg2+ for ATP was about 2- to 3-fold higher than that of spermine for ATP. Decrease in the binding of spermine to ATP by Mg2+ was not significant, and the binding constant of spermine for ATP-Mg2+ was 1.06 × 103m−1 (Fig. 6 C). Decrease in the binding of Mg2+ to ATP by spermine was also not significant, and the binding constant of Mg2+ for ATP-spermine was 2.83 × 103m−1. The results indicate that the binding sites of Mg2+ and spermine on ATP only partially overlap and support an idea that spermine can make a ternary complex with ATP-Mg2+. We examined how the ternary complex of ATP, Mg2+, and spermidine influences biological activity. The effect of spermine on the ATPase activity of PotA, one of the four components of a spermidine uptake system (22Furuchi T. Kashiwagi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20928-20933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was first examined. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, ATPase activity was greatly stimulated by spermine in the presence of 1–10 mm Mg2+. In the presence of 1–2 mm Mg2+, close to the physiological concentration of Mg2+ in mammalian cells, little or no activity was observed in the absence of spermine. Mg2+alone (3–10 mm) could enhance ATPase activity (Fig. 7 B), but spermine, at concentrations up to 10 mm, did not enhance ATPase activity in the absence of Mg2+ (data not shown). The addition of 50 mmK+ inhibited ATPase significantly when ATP-Mg2+complex was used. The results suggest that the ATP-Mg2+-spermine complex is more stable than the ATP-Mg2+ complex at the physiological concentrations of K+. The optimal pH was shifted from 6.9 to 8.1 in the presence of spermine (Fig. 7 C). The pH dependence of ATPase was similar to that for formation of the ATP-Mg2+-spermine complex, because the complex formation weakened with decreasing pH. Then, experiments were carried out to confirm that spermine functions as a stimulator of PotA ATPase through its interaction with ATP (Fig. 8). When the activities were shown as double reciprocal plots at several fixed concentrations of spermine, the lines were converged at the first quadrant, indicating that spermine binds to ATP, but not to PotA. The K m value of ATP for PotA decreased greatly with the increase in spermine concentration. Furthermore, binding of spermine to PotA was not observed when it was measured using the same method as spermidine binding to PotD, a spermidine binding protein (23Kashiwagi K. Pistocchi R. Shibuya S. Sugiyama S. Morikawa K. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12205-12208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The effect of spermine on protein kinase A was next examined. As shown in Fig. 9, the activity was stimulated by about 2-fold by 0.5–1 mm spermine. The stimulation was observed in the presence of 1–10 mm Mg2+. Spermine caused a decrease in the K m value of ATP (from 0.20 mm to 0.12 mm) and an increase in the V max value (from 25.3 to 30.3 pmol/min). These results suggest that a ternary complex of ATP-Mg2+-spermine plays important roles in ATP-involved enzymatic reactions. Polyamines are known to function as cell-proliferating factors through their interaction with nucleic acids, phospholipids, and nucleotides, including ATP. However, it is still not clear how polyamines interact with these acidic substances. In this study, we found that spermine can form a ternary complex with ATP and Mg2+. The increased broadening of both the β- and γ- phosphate resonances in the 31P NMR and the decrease in the ratio of the peak heights of β/α and γ/α suggest that spermine interacts with Mg2+-ATP predominantly at the β- and γ-phosphates of ATP. As indicated above, this broadening probably indicates that the conformation around the β-phosphate is exchanging slowly. Because there was no significant binding of Mg2+ to spermine in our 1H NMR experiments, the binding of spermine to ATP can be attributed to the ATP-Mg2+ binary complex. The fixation of adenine to the anti with respect to the ribose moiety by Mg2+ may be important for the conformational change of β- and γ-phosphates of ATP by spermine. Because NOE was observed only between adjacent protons of spermine, the conformation of spermine is likely linear in the ATP-Mg2+-spermine complex. Because intramolecular NOE cross peaks between spermine and the adenosine moiety of ATP were not observed, it is concluded that spermine interacts with the triphosphate group but not with the adenosine moiety of ATP. In the ATP-Mg2+-spermine complex, adenine was mainly fixedanti with respect to the ribose moiety, which was in the equilibrium between the C2′-endo and C3′-endoconformers as found in the ATP-Mg2+ complex. The different orientation of the β- and γ-phosphates in the ATP-Mg2+-spermine complex may be important for recognition of the ATP complex at the active site of enzymes and/or for the subsequent hydrolysis of ATP. A similar structure, as for the relative position of phosphate, metal, and NH2 (or NH) group, has been reported in the Co(NH3)4-ATP ternary complex (24Stewart J. Jørgensen P.L. Grisham C.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4695-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and the Zn2+-ATP-2,2′-bipyridyl complex (25Orioli P. Cini R. Donati D. Mangani S. Nature. 1980; 283: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that polyamines modulate reactions involving ATP, such as those of ATPases and protein kinases, through a ternary complex containing ATP, Mg2+, and spermine. Indeed, we found that the activities of PotA ATPase and protein kinase A were enhanced by spermine in in vitro systems. In the case of PotA ATPase, stimulation occurred through spermine binding to an ATP-Mg2+ complex, and strong stimulation was observed when about 10–20% of the ATP-Mg2+ was complexed with spermine. Enhancement of PotA ATPase by spermidine and putrescine was also observed, but 2 times more spermidine and 100 times more putrescine were necessary to cause the similar effect to spermine (data not shown). Accordingly, the important questions are whether an ATP-Mg2+-polyamine complex is made in vivo and whether the complex can modulate reactions involving ATP in vivo. We estimated the cellular distribution of polyamines from their binding constants for DNA, RNA, phospholipids, and ATP, and their total concentration in cells (11Watanabe S. Kusama-Eguchi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20803-20809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding constants of spermine and spermidine for ATP were estimated to be 8.93 × 102m−1 and 4.46 × 102m−1, respectively, in the presence of 2 mm Mg2+ and 100 mmK+, close to the physiological ionic conditions (11Watanabe S. Kusama-Eguchi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20803-20809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These are consistent with the present results; the binding constants of spermine (1.06 × 103m−1) and spermidine (5.59 × 102m−1) for ATP-Mg2+ in the presence of 100 mm K+. Thus, it was calculated that about 10% ATP (equivalent to 0.3 mm) exists as the ATP-Mg2+-spermine (or spermidine) complex in ConA-activated bovine lymphocytes. The percentage of the ternary complex is parallel with polyamine contents in cells. Thus, it seems very likely that some reactions involving ATP are regulated by polyamines in rapidly growing cells, in which polyamine contents greatly increase (9Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3228) Google Scholar, 10Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 759-774PubMed Google Scholar). We have proposed that the cell proliferative effects of polyamines in both Escherichia coli (26Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Kishida K. Kakegawa T. Hirose S. Eur. J.

Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 5332-5337PubMed Google Scholar, 29Shimogori T. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) are mainly caused by the stimulation of protein synthesis through interactions of polyamines with RNA (11Watanabe S. Kusama-Eguchi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20803-20809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, polyamines may also be involved in cell proliferation and differentiation through reactions, such as phosphorylation and dephosphorylation involving ATP. It has been reported that protein kinase CK2 activity is stimulated by polyamines through interactions with the β-subunit of CK2 (30Leroy D. Filhol O. Delcros J.G. Pares S. Chambaz E.M. Cochet C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1242-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this system, however, the contribution of structural changes of ATP-Mg2+ by polyamines has not been studied. There is also a report that induction of ornithine decarboxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis, causes an enhanced level of tyrosine phosphorylation, particularly of p130CAS (31Auvinen M. Paasinen Sohns A. Hirai H. Anderson L.C. Hölttä E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6513-6523Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Bachrach 2U. Bachrach, in the meeting on “Advances in Polyamine Research” in Trento (Italy), June 3–6 (1998). and co-workers recently reported in the meeting that activities of tyrosine kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases were stimulated by polyamines. It has been reported that phosphorylation of Okazaki-like DNA fragments in mammalian cells is strongly stimulated by polyamines (32Pohjanpelto P. Hölttä E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1193-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, the complex of ATP-Mg2+-spermine may also be involved in the phosphorylation of DNA or RNA. In E. coli, we estimated that at least 30% of ATP exists as the ATP-putrescine complex (33Miyamoto S. Kashiwagi K. Ito K. Watanabe S. Igarashi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Now, the complex is thought to be the ATP-Mg2+-putrescine complex. Thus, there is also a possibility that ATP-involved reactions in E. coli are regulated by polyamines. We thank Drs. K. Williams, R. J. Lindhardt, and T. Kawate for their kind suggestions and help in preparing this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2326998015,"We have previously documented that transgenic mice expressing SV40 Tag regulated by the rat prostatic steroid-binding protein C3(1) 5′-flanking region display multistage mammary tumorigenesis. To delineate genetic changes associated with mammary tumor progression, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was performed. CGH revealed a consistent gain of the telomeric region of chromosome 6. This region contains the Ki-ras proto-oncogene. Analyses of genomic DNA by Southern blot demonstrated up to 40-fold amplification of the Ki-ras gene. Ki-ras amplification was detected in 12, 46 and 68% of tumors from 4, 5 and 6 month old mice, respectively, whereas no amplifications were found in any preneoplastic mammary tissues. Tumors bearing Ki-ras gene amplification exhibited high levels of Ki-ras RNA and protein. The over-expressed Ki-Ras protein in these tumors appeared functionally active as indicated by the elevated MAP kinase activity. These data demonstrate that while Ki-ras amplification might not be an early event, there is a strong association between Ki-ras amplification and over-expression and mammary tumor progression in this model. This study also shows that CGH is a powerful and useful technique for identifying chromosomal copy number changes during tumor progression, and that this model may provide a predictable in vivo system for studying gene amplification."

Ca2+ signals in cells are complex events involving both intracellular Ca2+ pool release and extracellular Ca2+ entry. Emptying of intracellular Ca2+ pools is the major trigger for activation of Ca2+ entry during the generation of receptor-mediated Ca2+ signals (1Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G.S.

Because of the reactivity of thiols toward NO, the sphere of influence of NO can be highly restricted; hence, rather than being diffusion-dependent, NO (or an equivalent of the nitrosonium ion, NO+) may be donated and exchanged between neighboring protein thiols by local transnitrosation events (6Stamler J.S.

Resting Ca2+ levels were approximately 60–90 nm in DDT1MF-2 cells and 25–50 nm in DC-3F cells; maximal activation by GEA3162 resulted in up to 600 nmCa2+. Measurements shown are representative of at least three and, in most cases a larger number, of independent experiments. GEA3162,1GEA5024, and LY83583 were from Alexis Corp.

Fura-2/acetoxymethylester was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). 8-Br-cGMP was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA).N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) and all other compounds were from Sigma. Measurements of cGMP were made using the standard protocol of the NEN Life Science Products RIA kit.

A profound, dose-dependent increase in cytosolic Ca2+ was induced by application of the NO-donating oxatriazole derivative, GEA3162, as shown in Fig. 1 A. An unusually lipophilic NO-releasing agent, GEA3162, was recently characterized as a highly effective NO donor in vitro and in mediating the actions of NO on intact cells (27Kankaanranta H. Rydell E. Petersson A.-S. Holm P. Moilanen E. Corell T. Karup G. Vuorinen P. Pedersen S.B. Wennmalm A. Metsa-Ketela T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 28Kosonen O. Kankaanranta H. Vuorinen P. Moilanen E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 337: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although lipophilic, this mesoionic 3-aryl-substituted oxatriazole-5-imine derivative is sufficiently amphipathic that it may preferentially localize to donate NO in close proximity to the membrane surface. The increase in Ca2+ after application of GEA3162 was preceded by a lag, which itself was dose-dependent and of at least 1 min in duration. The GEA3162-induced rise in Ca2+ was clearly due to entry; in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, 100 μm GEA3162 induced no change in cytosolic Ca2+ (Fig. 1 B), indicating that no release from pools occurred. An immediate and large increase in cytosolic Ca2+ was observed upon Ca2+ readdition, indicating that entry had become fully activated. The action of GEA3162 was not attributable to any change in Ca2+ efflux because experiments (not shown) revealed no effect on the ability of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump to pump down Ca2+ in the cells. As seen in Fig. 1 (A and B), the GEA3162-induced Ca2+ entry mechanism became deactivated with time; after reaching a maximum within a few minutes, the entry of Ca2+ always decreased. In other experiments, reapplication of 100 μm GEA3162 after deactivation caused no further increase in Ca2+; removal of GEA3162 for 5 min and subsequent readdition also did not cause reactivation of the entry process. Other structurally diverse NO donors activated similar Ca2+ entry; application of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or sodium nitrite (NO2−) each induced increases in cytosolic Ca2+ (Fig. 2, A and C). In both cases, relatively high levels of the donors were required (likely due to lower efficiency at physiological pH), and the rise in Ca2+ was smaller and more variable than with GEA3162 but again occurred after a significant lag period. As with GEA3162, no significant changes in Ca2+ were observed with either SNP or NO2− in the absence of external Ca2+; however, Ca2+ entry again commenced immediately upon readdition of external Ca2+ (Fig. 2,B and D).Figure 2Ca2+ entry activated by other NO donors. A, cells were treated with 1.5 mm SNP added at the arrow. B, medium was replaced with Ca2+-free medium as shown by thebars, and then following a brief intervening exposure to standard Ca2+-containing medium, 1.5 mm SNP was added in the presence of Ca2+-free medium before reapplication of Ca2+-containing medium. C, cells were treated with 15 mm sodium nitrite (NO2−) added at the arrow. D, medium was replaced with Ca2+-free medium as shown by the bars, followed by addition of 15 mm NO2− at the arrow and return of cells to normal Ca2+-containing medium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Crucial to investigate was the relationship between this NO donor-induced entry process and the operation of intracellular Ca2+ pools. The results shown in Fig. 3 reveal that pool emptying has a major stimulatory action on the Ca2+ entry pathway. Pools were emptied with either of two distinct intracellular Ca2+ pump blockers, thapsigargin (29Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2998) Google Scholar) and DBHQ (30Moore G.A. McConkey D.J. Kass G.E. O'Brien P.J. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, 10 μm DBHQ caused a rapid release of pool Ca2+ followed by a later rise of Ca2+representing store-operated Ca2+ entry (26Ufret-Vincenty C.A. Short A.D. Alfonso A. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26790-26793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Upon application of GEA3162 there was a large and almost instantaneous rise in cytosolic Ca2+. Thus, pool emptying had completely eliminated the lag seen with normal pool-filled cells (Fig. 1 A). The effect of pool emptying was even more profound at lower GEA3162 levels (Fig. 3, B and C). 10 μm GEA3162 had no effect on normal cells (Fig. 1 A) but was able to induce a substantial and rapid effect after pool emptying (Fig. 3 C). At 25 μm (Fig. 3 B) the long (>4 min) delay in onset of Ca2+entry was almost completely eliminated after pool emptying. Emptying of pools with either thapsigargin or the ionophore, ionomycin, gave identical stimulation of the GEA3162-induced influx. The enhancement of NO donor-induced Ca2+ entry after pool emptying was not due to increased cytosolic Ca2+; at longer times following pool emptying with DBHQ or thapsigargin (up to 3 h) at which time cytosolic Ca2+ had returned to a level indistinguishable from basal levels (yet pools remained completely empty), the sensitivity to and rapidity of action of GEA3162 were exactly as observed upon addition immediately following pool emptying. The potentiation of the effect of GEA by pool emptying was not a reflection of the inability of the intracellular Ca2+ pumps to buffer Ca2+ in the cytosol. Thus, as shown in Fig. 3 A(inset), GEA3162-induced entry of Mn2+, monitored by quenching of fura-2 excited at its isosbestic wavelength, 360 nm, revealed identical kinetics and stimulation by pool emptying as seen for changes in cytosolic Ca2+ measured by ratio fluorimetry. Mn2+ is not a substrate for Ca2+pumps and hence reliably reports influx without being pumped into organelles or out of the cell. When 100 μm GEA3162 was added in the presence of 1 mm Mn2+, a significant entry of Mn2+ occurred. However, the onset of Mn2+ entry was slow to develop, and it took almost 90 s before maximal entry was occurring. After the pools had been emptied with 1 μm thapsigargin, 100 μm GEA induced an immediate entry of Mn2+, which remained at this rate for approximately 45 s before declining. Under this condition the contribution of endogenous store-operated entry without GEA was almost negligible. Thus, the kinetics of GEA-dependent Mn2+ influx were almost identical to the kinetics of Ca2+ entry induced by 100 μm GEA as shown in Figs. 1 A and 3 A. Experiments revealed almost identical NO donor-induced Ca2+ entry in the unrelated DC-3F fibroblast cell line, which again was highly stimulated by the emptying of Ca2+ pools. These results indicate operation of an important and potentially widespread NO donor-induced Ca2+ entry mechanism that undergoes striking stimulation by pool emptying. Entry is activated at μm NO donor concentrations that may correspond to NO levels in the physiological nm range (27Kankaanranta H. Rydell E. Petersson A.-S. Holm P. Moilanen E. Corell T. Karup G.

Pharmacol. 1997; 337: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A major target for NO is the heme group of the guanylyl cyclase enzyme, and many effects of NO are mediated through the ensuing increased cGMP levels (10Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 63: 175-185Crossref Scopus (2131) Google Scholar, 11McDonald L.J. Murad F. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1996; 211: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no changes in Ca2+entry could be observed with application of 8-Br-cGMP over a broad range (10 μm to 1 mm). 8-Br-cGMP also did not modify NO donor-induced Ca2+ influx. Additionally, the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, LY83583 (31Schmidt M.J. Sawyer B.D. Truex L.L. Marshall W.S. Fleisch J.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 232: 764-769Google Scholar), had no effect on NO donor-induced Ca2+ entry. Measurements of cGMP did not reveal any significant changes in cGMP levels associated with Ca2+ entry activated by GEA3162. This latter result is significant in indicating that global NO elevation within the cells was not occurring and that the NO-donating activity of GEA3162 may be spatially restricted as a result of the lipophilic character of the molecule. Earlier studies suggested that NO-induced cGMP changes might mediate store-operated Ca2+ entry and that pool emptying could activate synthesis of NO (32Bahnson T.D. Pandol S.J. Dionne V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10808-10812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Xu X. Start R.A. Tortorici G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12645-12653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent work has suggested that such an effect may occur in only certain cell types and that increased cGMP may be dependent on, rather than the cause of, increased Ca2+ levels (34Gilon P. Obie J.F. Bian X. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 1995; 331: 649-656Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 35Bischof G. Serwold T.F. Machen T.E.

Sci. 1997; 18: 266-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast, the action of NO donors on Ca2+ entry described here appears to be entirely independent of cGMP, and instead may reflect an important direct action of NO. Recently, much attention has focused onS-nitrosylation events as major directprotein-modifying regulatory responses induced by NO that are independent of changes in cGMP (6Stamler J.S. Singel D. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar, 7Stamler J.S. Toone E.J. Lipton S.A. Sucher N.J.

Indeed, as described above, several major channels for Ca2+ and other ions are revealed to be activated by S-nitrosylation (13Broillet M. Firestein S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 14Broillet M. Firestein S.

In the present studies, the lack of involvement of cGMP in mediating the action of NO was consistent with a direct S-nitrosylation event mediating Ca2+ entry but certainly not proof. The role of thiol modification could only be ascertained by comparing the actions of known sulfhydryl-modifying reagents. The results shown in Fig. 4 reveal that the actions of two quite different membrane-permeant alkylating agents, 4-VP and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), were impressively similar to the effects of NO donors. Added to normal cells, 1 mm 4-VP induced a modest increase in cytosolic Ca2+ but only after a delay of approximately 2 min (Fig. 4 A). After pool emptying with the pump blocker, DBHQ, the action of 4-VP was greatly stimulated, inducing a rapid, large, and transient increase in Ca2+ almost identical to the NO donor-induced response. Again, in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, even at 10 mm, 4-VP induced no release of Ca2+, but immediately upon Ca2+ readdition, the increased level of cytosolic Ca2+ reflected a large, transient entry of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 4 C). Significantly, following the complete response to 4-VP, the effect of 100 μm GEA3162 was entirely blocked (Fig. 4 C), indicating that the alkylating agent and NO donor were activating the same Ca2+ entry mechanism. Reversed addition of the agents (GEA3162 followed by 4-VP) resulted in blockade of the action of 4-VP. If submaximally effective 4-VP concentrations were used, subsequently added GEA3162 induced an effect that corresponded inversely in size with that induced by 4-VP. From these results it is concluded that there is a stoichiometric activation of a finite number of entry channels by either NO donors or alkylators and that pool emptying profoundly stimulates the same mechanism of Ca2+ entry induced by either type of agent. The more powerful alkylator, NEM, at 10 μm induced effects that were very similar to 4-VP, activating a slight increase in Ca2+ alone that was greatly stimulated by pool emptying, in this case with thapsigargin (Fig. 4 B). Concentrations of NEM above 10 μm could not be used because they induced nonselective modification of the Ca2+ handling machinery of cells (especially Ca2+ pool release) not seen with 4-VP. As with 4-VP the action of NEM was clearly on Ca2+ entry and was again able to completely prevent the action of subsequently added GEA (Fig. 4 D). The competition between the actions of either of the two alkylators and GEA3162 is interesting. 4-VP and NEM are both membrane permeant. Of many NO donors tested, GEA3162 and the close structural analogue, GEA5024 (27Kankaanranta H. Rydell E. Petersson A.-S. Holm P. Moilanen E. Corell T. Karup G. Vuorinen P. Pedersen S.B. Wennmalm A. Metsa-Ketela T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), were most effective in activating Ca2+ entry. As mentioned above, these compounds differ from other NO donors in being lipophilic enough to penetrate the membrane; yet by virtue of weak charge on the oxatriazole ring, they may be sufficiently amphipathic to selectively donate NO at the surface of the membrane in the vicinity of reactive thiols of the entry channel or an associated protein. The results presented here reveal a novel and significant regulatory mechanism involved in the coupling of pool emptying to Ca2+ entry. Nitrosylation of thiols is becoming recognized as a widespread post-translational protein modification controlling the activity of a spectrum of major regulatory proteins (6Stamler J.S. Singel D. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar, 7Stamler J.S. Toone E.J. Lipton S.A. Sucher N.J.

The data indicate that Ca2+ entry is activated as a consequence of direct modification of one or more thiols either on the channel itself or a protein involved in its coupling to pool emptying. Importantly, activation via thiol nitrosylation provides a strong analogy with at least three other major Ca2+ channels, the ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channel (17Xu L. Eu J.P. Meissner G. Stamler J.S. Science. 1998; 279: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar), thel-type Ca2+ channel (16Campbell D.L. Stamler J.S. Strauss H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), and the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (13Broillet M. Firestein S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 14Broillet M. Firestein S. Neuron. 1997; 18: 951-958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In all cases, increased channel activity induced by NO-donors results from S-nitrosylation, and this stimulatory action is mimicked by modification of the presumed same thiol group (or groups) by alkylating agents. Whereas nitrosylation of the three other Ca2+ channels is of uncertain physiological role, in the present study it appears that the major physiological activating condition, namely emptying of pools, facilitates an increase in the susceptibility of the channel to activation by thiol modification. Such modification does not necessarily require a generalized increase in NO levels within the cytosol and indeed may reflect a localized transnitrosation event from a nearby donor nitrosothiol (7Stamler J.S. Toone E.J. Lipton S.A. Sucher N.J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 691-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 8Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar); this event may be stimulated by pool emptying and intimately involved in the process of coupling pool emptying to Ca2+ entry. Pool emptying appears therefore to induce a significant conformational change in a Ca2+ entry channel or associated protein, increasing the availability of a key thiol, modification of which greatly enhances channel activity. Lastly, a conformational alteration in the availability of thiols on the entry channel specifically induced by pool emptying provides a direct means to selectively label and identify the channel protein itself.

S., Lee, M.-O., Chung, M., Moore, D. D., and Lee, J. W. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 6, 3212–3215). Herein, we show that a distinct IκB protein Bcl3 also interacts with RXR, as shown in the yeast two-hybrid tests and glutathioneS-transferase pull-down assays. The Bcl3 interaction involved two distinct subregions of RXR, i.e. constitutive interactions of the N-terminal ABC domains and 9-cis-RA-dependent interactions of the C-terminal DEF domains. In contrast to IκBβ, Bcl3 did not interact with the AF2 domain of RXR. Bcl3 specifically interacted with the general transcription factors TFIIB, TBP, and TFIIA but not with TFIIEα in the GST pull-down assays. TBP and TFIIA, however, were not able to interact with IκBβ. Accordingly, Bcl3 coactivated the 9-cis-RA-induced transactivations of RXR, in contrast to the inhibitory actions of IκBβ. In addition, coexpression of SRC-1 but not p300 further stimulated the Bcl3-mediated enhancement of the 9-cis-RA-induced transactivations of RXR.

These include six regions of the primary structure, commonly referred to as regions A through F. The N-terminal half of the receptor contains the A/B region, which is highly variable in sequence and length. Region C, the DNA-binding domain, harbors two type II zinc fingers and is highly conserved, whereas region D, also called the hinge domain, is highly variable in length and sequence. The C-terminal half of the receptor contains the E and F regions, which harbor the ligand-binding domain (LBD)1 and the C-terminal activation function 2 (AF2), respectively. The superfamily includes receptors for a variety of small hydrophobic ligands such as steroids, T3, and retinoids, as well as a large number of related proteins that do not have known ligands, referred to as orphan nuclear receptors (for a review see Ref. 2Mangelsdorf D.J.

The N-terminal domain (AF1) contains a ligand-independent activation function, whereas the extreme C-terminal region (AF2) of the LBD exhibits ligand-dependent transactivation (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6088) Google Scholar). Recent x-ray crystallographic studies of the LBD of nuclear receptors revealed that the ligand binding induces a major conformational change in the AF2 region (22Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar, 23Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D.

These coactivators are postulated to function to transmit the signal of ligand-induced conformational change to the basal transcription machinery. As expected, many coactivators fail to interact with AF2 mutants of nuclear receptors (5Cavailles V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P.J. Parker M.G.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). The transcription factor NFκB is important for the inducible expression of a wide variety of cellular and viral genes (reviewed in Refs. 25Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar and 26Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5579) Google Scholar). NFκB is composed of homo- and heterodimeric complexes of members of the Rel/NFκB family of polypeptides. In vertebrates, this family comprises p50, p65 (RelA), c-Rel, p52, and RelB. These proteins share a 300-amino acid region, known as the Rel homology domain, which binds to DNA and mediates homo- and heterodimerization. This domain also is target of the IκB inhibitors, which include IκBα, IκBβ, IκBγ, Bcl3, p105, and p100 (27Gilmore T.D. Morin P.J. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 427-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In the majority of cells, NFκB exists in an inactive form in the cytoplasm, bound to the inhibitory IκB proteins. Treatment of cells with various inducers results in the degradation of IκB proteins. The bound NFκB is released and translocates to the nucleus, where it activates appropriate target genes. IκBα is degraded in response to all of the known inducers of NFκB, whereas IκBβ is degraded only when cells are stimulated with inducers such as lipopolysaccharide and interleukin-1, which cause persistent activation of NFκB (28Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Following degradation of the initial pool of IκBβ in response to lipopolysaccharide or interleukin-1, newly synthesized IκBβ accumulates in the nucleus as an unphosphorylated protein that forms a stable complex with NFκB and prevents it from binding to newly synthesized IκBα (29Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Weil R. Laurent-Winter C. Israel A J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9942-9949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Bcl3 is an unusal IκB protein in that it can not only inhibit nuclear NFκB complexes but can bind to p50 and p52 dimers on DNA and provide the complexes with transactivating activity (31Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 32Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Liou H.-C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1354-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that IκBβ specifically interacted with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and inhibited its 9-cis-RA-dependent transactivation in lipopolysaccharide-treated cells (33Na S.-Y. Kim H.-J. Lee S.-K. Choi H.-S. Na D.S. Lee M.-O. Chung M. Moore D.D. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 6: 3212-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These results led us to examine whether another IκB molecule Bcl3 is also capable of functionally interacting with RXR. Herein, we show that Bcl3 indeed interacts with two subregions of RXR. In contrast to IκBβ, however, Bcl3 did not interact with the AF2 domain of RXR. Furthermore, Bcl3 and IκBβ showed different interaction profiles with general transcription factors. Accordingly, Bcl3 coactivated the 9-cis-RA-induced transactivations of RXR in cotransfections with CV1 cells, alone, or in synergy with SRC-1, in contrast to the inhibitory actions of IκBβ. From these results, we propose that distinct IκB proteins may differentially modulate the 9-cis-RA-dependent transactivations of RXR in vivo. Polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments encoding IκBβΔ4, IκBβΔ5, Bcl3Δ1, Bcl3Δ2, Bcl3Δ3, and RXR-LBDΔAF2 were cloned into EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of the B42 fusion vector pJG4–5 (34Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). LexA fusions to IκBβ, IκBβΔ1, IκBβΔ2, IκBβΔ3, and Bcl3, as well as a B42 fusion to RXR-LBD and GST fusions to p50, p65, Bcl3, RXR, RXR-LBD, thyroid hormone receptor (TR), and the AF2 mutant TR459, were as described previously (33Na S.-Y.

T7 in vitro translation vectors encoding Bcl3, p65, and IκBβ, as well as mammalian expression vectors encoding RXR, Bcl3, SRC-1, and p300, were as described previously (33Na S.-Y. Kim H.-J. Lee S.-K.

GST fusion vectors encoding TBP and TFIIA, along with T7 vectors encoding TFIIEα and TFIIB were kind gifts from Dr. David Moore (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX).

The reporter construct TREpal-LUC, the transfection indicator construct pRSV-β-gal, the expression vector for Gal4-VP16, and the reporter construct Gal4-LUC were as described (33Na S.-Y. Kim H.-J.

All the polymerase chain reaction-based constructs were sequenced against any unwanted sequences that may have been erroneously introduced during amplifications. For the yeast two-hybrid tests, plasmids encoding LexA fusions and B42 fusions were cotransformed intoSaccharomyces cerevisiae EGY48 strain containing theLacZ reporter plasmid, SH/18-34 (34Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Plate and liquid assays of LacZ expression were carried out as described (35Lee J.W. Moore D.D. Heyman R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1245-1253PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained in more than two similar experiments. The GST fusions or GST alone were expressed in Escherichia coli, bound to glutathione-Sepharose-4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and incubated with labeled proteins expressed by in vitrotranslation using the TNT-coupled transcription-translation system, with conditions as described by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). Specifically bound proteins were eluted from beads with 40 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, as described (37Seol W. Mahon M.J. Lee Y.-K. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1646-1655PubMed Google Scholar). CV1 cells were grown in 24-well plates with medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped serum for 24 h and transfected with 100 ng of the LacZexpression vector pRSV-β-gal and 100 ng of a reporter gene TREpal-LUC, along with 10 ng of RXRα and increasing amounts (10 to 200 ng) of Bcl3, SRC-1, or p300 expression vectors. For control experiments, Gal4-LUC and Gal4-VP16 (36Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) replaced TREpal-LUC and RXR, respectively. Total amounts of expression vectors were kept constant by adding decreasing amounts of the CDM8 expression vector. After 12 h, cells were washed and refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum either in the presence or absence of 10−7m9-cis-RA. Cells were harvested 24 h later, and luciferase activity was assayed as described (38Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene and Associates, New York1995Google Scholar), and the results were normalized to the LacZ expression. Similar results were obtained in more than two similar experiments. In the yeast two-hybrid tests (34Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar), the full-length IκBβ and Bcl3 interacted with the LBD of RXR in a 9-cis-RA-stimulated manner (Ref. 33Na S.-Y. Kim H.-J. Lee S.-K. Choi H.-S. Na D.S. Lee M.-O. Chung M. Moore D.D. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 6: 3212-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (23) Google Scholar and Table I) but not with the LBD of glucocorticoid receptor (data not shown). A series of deletion mutants were constructed to localize the interaction interfaces (Fig. 1). As shown in Table I, B42 fusion to the LBD of RXR (B42/RXR-LBD) interacted with IkBβΔ1, IκBβΔ2, IkBβΔ3, and IkBβΔ5 but not with IkBβΔ4, localizing the RXR interaction interface to the IκBβ amino acids 253–312. Similarly, B42/RXR-LBD interacted with Bcl3Δ2 and Bcl3Δ3 but not with Bcl3Δ1, localizing the RXR interaction interface to the Bcl3 amino acids 289 to the C terminus. The IκBβ-RXR interactions involved the AF2 domain of RXR, as demonstrated by loss of the 9-cis-RA dependence in interactions of IκBβ and its deletional mutants with B42/RXR-LBDΔAF2, a B42 fusion to the previously described mutant RXR-LBD that lacks the AF2 function (39Zavacki A.M.

These results are consistent with our previous report (33Na S.-Y. Kim H.-J. Lee S.-K. Choi H.-S. Na D.S. Lee M.-O. Chung M. Moore D.D. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 6: 3212-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (23) Google Scholar), in which IκBβ was shown to interact with the AF2 domain of TR. In contrast, however, B42/RXR-LBDΔAF2 still retained the 9-cis-RA-dependent interactions with Bcl3, Bcl3Δ2, and Bcl3Δ3, demonstrating that the Bcl3-RXR interaction did not involve the AF2 domain, distinct from the IκBβ results (33Na S.-Y. Kim H.-J. Lee S.-K. Choi H.-S. Na D.S. Lee M.-O. Chung M. Moore D.D. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 6: 3212-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, LexA fusions to IκBβ, IκBβΔ4, Bcl3, and Bcl3Δ2 were transcriptional activators of the LacZ reporter gene controlled by upstream LexA-binding sites (34Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Thus, the autonomous transactivation domains of IκBβ and Bcl3 in yeast were mapped to the N-terminal 90 amino acids of IκBβ and the Bcl3 amino acids 156–289, respectively (Table I and Fig. 1).Table IInteractions between IκBs and RXR in yeastLigandB42 fusion to−RXR-LBDRXR-LBDΔAF2−+−+−+LexA/−−−−−−−LexA/IκBβ+++++++++++LexA/IκBβΔ1−−++++++++LexA/IκBβΔ2−−++++++++LexA/IκBβΔ3−−++++++++LexA/IκBβΔ4++++++LexA/IκBβΔ5−−++++++++LexA/Bcl3++++++++++++LexA/Bcl3Δ1−−−−−−LexA/Bcl3Δ2++++++++LexA/Bcl3Δ3−−++++++The indicated B42 and LexA plasmids were transformed into a yeast strain containing an appropriate LacZ reporter gene.

To further characterize these interactions in vitro, various GST fusion proteins were expressed, purified, and tested for interaction with an in vitro translated Bcl3. These include a full-length RXR, the LBDs of wild type RXR and deletion mutant for the AF2 domain (RXR-LBD and RXR-LBDΔAF2), the N-terminal ABC domains of RXR (RXR-ABC), and full-length TRs, wild type or point-mutated for the AF2 domain (TR and TR459, respectively) (33Na S.-Y. Kim H.-J. Lee S.-K. Choi H.-S. Na D.S. Lee M.-O. Chung M. Moore D.D. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 6: 3212-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 39Zavacki A.M. Lehmann J.M.

As shown in Fig. 2, Bcl3 constitutively interacted with either the full-length RXR or RXR-ABC. In agreement with the yeast results, however, week basal interactions of Bcl3 with RXR-LBD or RXR-LBDΔAF2 were significantly stimulated by the presence of 1 μm 9-cis-RA. These results suggest that RXR contains at least two interaction interfaces with Bcl3: a constitutive interaction interface at the N-terminal region of RXR and a 9-cis-RA-dependent interaction interface at the LBD that doesn't involve the AF2 domain. Similarly, Bcl3 also interacted with TR and TR459, and addition of 1 μm T3 further stimulated these interactions. These results are in marked contrast to the previously described IκBβ results (33Na S.-Y. Kim H.-J. Lee S.-K. Choi H.-S. Na D.S. Lee M.-O. Chung M. Moore D.D. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 6: 3212-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (23) Google Scholar), in which the AF2 mutants TRΔ and TR459 showed relatively weak, T3-independent interactions with IκBβ. These results, along with the yeast results, confirm that IκBβ and Bcl3 exploit distinct regions of RXR to interact with. In particular, IκBβ utilizes the intact AF2 domain of RXR, whereas Bcl3 exploit yet unspecified non-AF2 region of the RXR-LBD for the 9-cis-RA-dependent interactions. IκBβ showed autonomous transcriptional activities in yeast and mammalian cells (Table I and data not shown). Bcl3 was also shown to have two separate domains that are able to cooperate to confer transactivation functions to otherwise inactive p50 homodimers (31Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In our hands, Bcl3 showed autonomous transactivation functions in yeast (Table I), whereas both LexA and Gal4 fusions to Bcl3 efficiently repressed the LexA-LUC and Gal4-LUC reporter gene expressions, respectively (data not shown). Thus, we examined whether IκBβ and Bcl3 are capable of directly interacting with known general transcription factors by using the GST pull-down assays. As expected, the p50-p65 interactions, along with the p50-Bcl3 and p65-IκBβ interactions, were readily detected in this assay system (Fig. 3). In addition, p50 interacted with TFIIB but not with TFIIEα, as described previously (40Kerr L.D. Ransone L.J. Wamsley P. Schmitt M.J. Boyer T.G. Zhou Q. Berk A.J. Verma I.M.

Bcl3 also interacted with TFIIB, TBP, and TFIIA but not with TFIIEα (Fig. 3). In contrast, TBP and TFIIA were not able to interact with IκBβ, attesting to differences between IκBβ and Bcl3 in communicating with the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex. These results, along with the differences of IκBβ and Bcl3 in recognizing RXR (Table I and Fig. 2), also provide a mechanistic basis for the differential regulations of the RXR transactivations by IκBβ and Bcl3 (see the following cotransfection results). To assess the functional consequences of these interactions, Bcl3 was cotransfected into CV1 cells along with an RXR expression vector and a reporter construct controlled by TREpal, which is transactivated by RXR-RXR homodimers as well as various receptor heterodimers (43Baniahmad A. Steiner C. Kohne A.C. Renkawitz R Cell. 1990; 61: 505-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of cotransfected Bcl3 enhanced the 9-cis-RA-induced transcription of RXR (without significantly affecting the basal level) in a dose-dependent manner, with cotransfection of 50 ng of Bcl3 increasing transcriptional activities approximately 4.5-fold (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, cotransfection of Bcl3 affected neither the transcriptional activity of Gal4-VP16, as assessed using the Gal4-LUC reporter construct (36Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M.

https://openalex.org/W1982351062,"The G1-S transition in mammalian cells has been demonstrated to require the cyclin-dependent kinases cdk2, cdk3 and cdk4/6. Here we show that a novel kinase activity associated with cdk3 fluctuates throughout the cell cycle differently from the expression of cyclin D1-, E- and A-associated kinase activities. Cdk3 kinase activity is neither affected by p16 (in contrast to cdk4/6) nor by E2F-1 (in contrast to cdk2), but is downregulated upon transient p27 expression. We found cdk3 to bind to p21 and p27. We provide evidence that p27 could be involved in the regulation of the cell cycle fluctuation of cdk3 activity: cdk3 protein does not fluctuate and interaction of cdk3 with p27, but not with p21, is lost when cdk3 kinase becomes active during the cell cycle. In Myc-overexpressing cells, but not in normal Rat1 cells, constitutive ectopic expression of cdk3 induces specific upregulation of cdk3-associated kinase activity that is still cell cycle phase dependent. Ectopic cdk3, but not cdk2, enhances Myc-induced proliferation and anchorage-independent growth associated with Myc activation, without effects on cyclin D1, E and A protein expression or kinase activities. High levels of cdk3 in Myc-overexpressing cells trigger up- and deregulation of E2F-dependent transcription without inducing the E2F-DNA binding capacity. In contrast to all other studied positive G1 regulators, cdk3 is unable to cooperate with ras in fibroblast transformation suggesting a function of cdk3 in G1 progression that is different from cyclin D- or E-associated kinase activities. Our data provide first insights into the regulation of cdk3-associated kinase activity and suggest a model how cdk3 participates in the regulation of the G1-S transition."

Here we report that the gene G11 located in the human major histocompatibility complex encodes a novel Ser/Thr protein kinase. The G11 gene products of 41.5 and 30 kDa were expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus system and transiently in the mammalian cell line COS-7. It was found that after immunoprecipitation of the G11 polypeptides from recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cell lysates or transfected COS-7 cell lysates the immunoprecipitates contained a Mn2+-dependent protein kinase activity that phosphorylated α-casein at Ser/Thr residues and histone at Ser residues. Furthermore, mutation of the ATP-binding site by converting the invariant lysine in the catalytic domain (amino acid 317) to a proline resulted in the complete ablation of the enzyme activity. This was consistent with the observation that the G11 polypeptide can be covalently modified by the reactive ATP analogue 5′-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine in the absence of ATP, and that this modification is prevented in the presence of 1 mm ATP, indicating that the kinase domain of the G11 polypeptide is capable of binding ATP. Immunofluorescence staining of transfected COS-7 cells transiently expressing G11 revealed that this novel Ser/Thr protein kinase is localized predominantly in the nucleus.

The major histocompatibility complex (MHC)1 which is located on the short arm of human chromosome 6, in the 6p21.3 band, spans ∼4 megabase pairs of DNA and contains the class I and class II genes that encode cell surface molecules essential for the immune response to infectious agents (1Campbell, R. D., and Trowsdale, J. (1997) Immunol. Today 18, centerfold posterGoogle Scholar). In recent years a detailed characterization of the MHC has revealed the presence of at least 150 additional genes to the class I and class II genes that mostly encode proteins of unknown function (2Aguado B.

Characterization of these genes and the proteins they encode is of major biomedical interest as susceptibility to a large number of human diseases, including over 40 autoimmune diseases and the immunodeficiencies IgA deficiency and common variable immunodeficiency, is associated with genes within the MHC (5Hall F.C.

One of the recently described novel genes, called G11, is located in the class III region of the MHC 611 bp upstream of the complement C4A locus (7Sargent C.A. Anderson M.J. Hsieh S.L. Kendall E. Gomez-Escobar N. Campbell R.D. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1994; 3: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). cDNAs corresponding to two different G11 mRNAs were obtained and sequenced, the longest cDNA predicting an intracellular protein of 364-amino acids (labeled here G11-Z) (GenBank accession number L26260) (8Shen L.

The second G11 cDNA predicts an intracellular protein (labeled here G11-Y) (GenBank accession number X77380) (7Sargent C.A. Anderson M.J. Hsieh S.L. Kendall E. Gomez-Escobar N. Campbell R.D. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1994; 3: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) which lacks the N-terminal 110 amino acids of the 364-amino acid G11 polypeptide. In addition, sequence analysis of PCR products generated by amplification of reverse transcribed RNA from a number of different cell lines has shown the presence of sequences that contained a 12-bp insertion between nucleotides 790 and 791 of the G11-Z cDNA sequence (7Sargent C.A. Anderson M.J. Hsieh S.L. Kendall E. Gomez-Escobar N. Campbell R.D. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1994; 3: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This is due to the differential use of two splice sites at the end of exon 5 and results in the presence of G11-Z polypeptides of 364 or 368 amino acids, and G11-Y polypeptides of 254 or 258 amino acids, which either contain or lack the 4 amino acids, Val-Cys-Asp-Cys (7Sargent C.A. Anderson M.J. Hsieh S.L. Kendall E. Gomez-Escobar N. Campbell R.D. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1994; 3: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The G11 polypeptides share limited sequence similarity with a number of different protein families, although the most significant similarity found was with the tyrosine kinase transforming protein from fujinami virus (18.7% identity, 32.5% similarity over the C-terminal 157 amino acids; align score, 3.84 S.D. units) (7Sargent C.A. Anderson M.J. Hsieh S.L. Kendall E. Gomez-Escobar N. Campbell R.D. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1994; 3: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). If the most extensive homology is indicative of the function of G11 then it could suggest that the G11 gene encodes a novel kinase-like activity. The importance of phosphorylation events in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic species and in almost every aspect of nuclear as well as cytoplasmic processes has become clear in recent years. Cellular protein kinases and phosphatases participate in, among other events, the regulation of differentiation, cell division, transcription, and DNA repair through universal signaling pathways (9Witters L.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10Karin M. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 11Finnie N.J. Gottlieb T.M. Blunt T. Jeggo P.A. Jackson S.P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

The end result is usually the activation or inactivation of proteins that regulate transcription, resulting in specific changes in gene expression. In most cases, the mechanisms influencing gene transcription also appear to involve protein phosphorylation. The regulation can be positive or negative and it can affect DNA binding activity, transactivation function, and modulate nuclear translocation (12Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Thus the characterization of all intracellular kinases and phosphatases is crucial in order to fully understand their function and the signaling pathways they are components of. In this paper we report the expression of the G11 coding sequence in insect cells and in the mammalian cell line COS-7. We show that immunoprecipitates of G11 prepared from insect cells infected with the G11 recombinant virus and from COS-7 cells transfected with the G11 coding sequence possess a Ser/Thr protein kinase activity that phosphorylates the nonspecific kinase substrates α-casein and histone. This activity was ablated when the invariant lysine (amino acid 317) in the catalytic domain was mutated to a proline. Furthermore, we present evidence that the subcellular localization of the G11 polypeptide is in the nucleus. In order to generate the complete G11-Z cDNA sequence the 429 bp corresponding to the 5′ end was obtained by performing PCR on reverse-transcribed total RNA isolated from Molt4 cells by the RNazol B method (Biotecx Laboratories) using primers 5′-CGTCAGCAGTTTTGTCAGGTGCCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGAATTCCCTGTCTCAGCCACCATCATG-3′ (antisense). 10% of the product from the first round PCR was used as a template for a second round PCR using nested primers 5′-GGAATTCGGCCGAAGGATGCAAAAGTGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAGAGGATCCGACTCCACAGGCCC-3′ (antisense). The PCR products were end-filled and digested with EcoRI/BamHI before the 429-bp product was recovered from an agarose gel using GeneClean (BIO 101 Inc.). The pBluescript vector containing the G11-Y construct (7Sargent C.A. Anderson M.J. Hsieh S.L. Kendall E. Gomez-Escobar N. Campbell R.D. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1994; 3: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was digested with EcoRI/BamHI to remove the 130 bp at the 5′ end of the G11-Y cDNA and this was replaced with the 429-bp EcoRI/BamHI PCR fragment to create the full-length G11-Z cDNA. Clones were fully sequenced on both strands. The 1220-bp XbaI/EcoRI fragment of the pBluescript clone containing the G11-Z coding sequence, the 880-bpAsp718/EcoRI fragment containing the G11-Y coding sequence (7Sargent C.A. Anderson M.J. Hsieh S.L. Kendall E. Gomez-Escobar N. Campbell R.D. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1994; 3: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the 868-bp Asp718/EcoRI fragment containing the G11-Y coding sequence minus the 4 amino acid residues Val-Cys-Asp-Cys (labeled here G11-Y(-VCDC)) (7Sargent C.A. Anderson M.J. Hsieh S.L. Kendall E. Gomez-Escobar N. Campbell R.D. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1994; 3: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), were blunt ended and inserted into the BamHI site of the vector pBS-Tag. This resulted in the addition in-frame of 42 bp at the 5′ end of the G11 cDNA sequences that encode a T7 gene 10 peptide tag (Met-Ala-Ser-Met-Thr-Gly-Gly-Gln-Gln-Met-Gly-Arg-Asp-Pro). The resultant plasmids were digested with XbaI/EcoRI, end-filled, and subcloned into the baculovirus expression vector pAcCL29.1 and into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The G11-Z cDNA was also cloned into pBK-CMV (Stratagene) without the T7 gene 10 peptide tag. In vitro site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the G11-Z cDNA as a template in the PCR reaction in the presence of Pfu (Stratagene). Oligonucleotide 5′-TGGGAGATTCATCACGTACTTTGTTAAAGG-3′ and the corresponding antisense primer were used in the reaction where the lysine residue at amino acid 300 was changed to a proline. Oligonucleotide 5′-AGCATGGTCCGGACGGCAAAGTACCGG-3′ and the corresponding antisense primer were used in the reaction where the lysine residue at amino acid 315 was changed to a proline. Oligonucleotide 5′-GTCCGGAAGGCAACGTACCGGGAACTG-3′ and the corresponding antisense primer were used in the reaction where the lysine residue at amino acid 317 was changed to a proline. The three mutant cDNAs, designated G11–300R, G11–315R, and G11–317R, were cloned into the expression vector pBK-CMV. Sf21 cells were cultured at 28 °C in TC100 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. The G11 constructs (5 μg) were co-transfected with BacPAK6 viral DNA (CLONTECH) using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc). Recombinant viruses were plaque-purified three times on monolayers of Sf21 cells (13Milner C.M. Smith S.V. Carrillo M.B. Taylor G.L. Hollinshead M. Campbell R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4549-4558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For metabolic labeling Sf21 cells were infected with the recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 20 plaque forming units/cell. Twenty-four hours post-infection, infected and uninfected cells were pulse-labeled for 3 h with 200 μCi/ml Trans35S-label (ICN Biomedicals, 1200 Ci/mmol) in methionine and cysteine-free TC100 medium in the absence of serum (13Milner C.M.

COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. The cells were transfected with the G11 constructs (5 μg) using either DEAE dextran and chloroquine as described in Ref. 13Milner C.M. Smith S.V. Carrillo M.B. Taylor G.L. Hollinshead M.

To produce anti-G11 monoclonal antibodies the G11-Z cDNA was subcloned intoSmaI digested pGEX vector. The glutathioneS-transferase-G11 fusion protein was isolated from a SDS-PAGE and used to immunize BALB/c mice. Monoclonal antibodies were screened by a differential dot-blot assay as described in Ref. 27Yeh N.H. Chen C.M. Hsieh S.L. Chin. J. Microbiol. Immunol. 1988; 21: 210-223Google Scholar. Clone 1F3 (IgG1) which recognizes both conformational and denatured epitopes and immunoprecipitates both the wild type and mutant forms of G11-Z equally well, as seen in SDS-PAGE gels loaded with the same amount of each immunoprecipitate, from the same number of cells transfected with the appropriate plasmid construct (data not shown) was used in kinase assays when indicated. Infected and uninfected Sf21 cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 2 mm methionine, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, then the expressed tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from the lysates using the monoclonal antibody T7.Tag (Novagen), and the immune complexes were recovered on Protein A-Sepharose (14Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts or immune complexes were dissociated in sample buffer (0.4m Tris-HCl (pH 6.3), 2.3% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 12% (w/v) acrylamide gels (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in 39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris, 0.375% (w/v) SDS, then probed with a 1:2000 dilution of the T7.Tag monoclonal antibody as described in Ref. 16Khanna A. Campbell R.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar. For protein kinase assays Sf21 cells infected with the appropriate recombinant or wild-type virus, or COS-7 cells transfected with the appropriate construct, were lysed in 0.05% (w/v) SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, then diluted in modified RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 16 mm Na2 HPO4, 4 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.3) (17Konopka J.B. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3116-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The expressed proteins were immunoprecipitated from the lysates using the T7.Tag monoclonal antibody or the anti-G11 monoclonal antibody and the immune complexes were recovered on Protein A-Sepharose. The Sepharose pellet was washed 5 times with the modified RIPA buffer (the SDS was omitted) and twice with 0.05 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The pellet was then assayed for protein kinase activity in 10 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 mm MnCl2, 50 mm HEPES (pH 8), 1 mg/ml substrate (α-casein or histone, Sigma), and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 30 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer unless the reactions were further manipulated as indicated. Quantitative detection of the radioactivity was performed using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Analysis of32P-labeled proteins by partial acid hydrolysis was carried out as follows: 32P-labeled α-casein or histone were eluted from polyacrylamide gels by incubating crushed gel slices in 50 mm NH4HCO3, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol for 2 h at 37 °C. Eluted proteins were concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation with 20 μg of RNase as carrier. The precipitate was dissolved in 6 n HCl and incubated at 110 °C for 1 h. Samples dissolved in a marker mixture containing phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine at a concentration of 1 mg/ml each were then electrophoresed at pH 1.9 for 60 min in a buffer containing 7.8% (v/v) acetic acid and 88% (v/v) formic acid, followed by electrophoresis at pH 3.5 for 60 min in a buffer containing 5% (v/v) glacial acetic acid and 0.5% (v/v) pyridine. After electrophoresis the plates were dried, the internal phosphoamino acid markers were detected by staining with ninhydrin, and the labeled phosphoamino acids detected by autoradiography. Insect cells infected with the G11-Y recombinant virus were lysed in modified RIPA buffer. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The lysates were incubated with 20 mmMnCl2, 50 mm HEPES (pH 8), 1 mmFSBA (added from a 50 mm stock made up in dimethyl sulfoxide), in the presence or absence of 1 mm ATP at 30 °C. After the reactions had been terminated by adding electrophoresis sample buffer, immunoprecipitation was carried out by 10-fold dilution of the samples in PBS containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C with the T7.Tag monoclonal antibody. Immune complexes were recovered on Protein A-Sepharose, washed three times in PBS containing 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20 and eluted by boiling in electrophoresis sample buffer. Proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting. Blots were incubated with anti-FSBA antibodies at a 1:400 dilution. Visualization of the bound anti-FSBA antibodies was achieved using the ECL detection method (Amersham), followed by autoradiography. Immunocytochemistry analysis was carried out 48 h after transfection on COS-7 cells that had been seeded onto the plastic well of a 1-Chamber Lab-Teck slide (Nunc, Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were fixed in 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, then washed once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.25% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and diluted in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed once with washing buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.25% (w/v) gelatin) and blocked for 30 min at room temperature with 2% (v/v) goat serum diluted in PBS. After washing once with washing buffer, the cells were incubated with the T7.Tag monoclonal antibody diluted in PBS (1:3000) for 1 h at room temperature. Monoclonal antibodies against tubulin (Sigma) (at a 1:800 dilution) and to nuclear splicosomes (Chemicon) (at a 1:25 dilution) were used as controls. To remove the primary antibody the cells were washed 3 times with washing buffer, then the slides were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or IgM (Sigma) diluted in 10% (v/v) goat serum and visualized using an Axioscope microscope (Zeiss) at a magnification of × 1000. For functional characterization of the 368-amino acid G11-Z and the 258-amino acid G11-Y polypeptides, the entire protein-coding regions including a T7 gene 10 peptide tag at the N-terminal end were expressed in Sf21 insect cells under the control of the polyhedrin promoter. As shown by SDS-PAGE analysis of Trans35S-labeled cells, G11-Z and G11-Y were expressed as 41.5- and 30-kDa intracellular polypeptides (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 3), respectively. These are very close to the expected molecular masses of the G11-Z (40.5 kDa) and the G11-Y (28.4 kDa) polypeptides plus the 1.5-kDa peptide tag. Time course experiments revealed that the expression levels of the recombinant proteins reached a maximum between 24 and 36 h after infection (data not shown). Western blot analysis of extracts from infected cells using the T7.Tag antibody which reacts against the T7 gene 10 peptide tag detected the same polypeptides of 41.5 and 30 kDa (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and 3), respectively. In addition, the T7.Tag antibody was able to immunoprecipitate the G11 polypeptides from labeled insect cells infected with the different G11 recombinant viruses (Fig. 1 C). Analysis of the supernatants recovered after spinning down the immune complexes bound to the Protein A-Sepharose beads by SDS-PAGE revealed that all the G11 polypeptides had been successfully immunoprecipitated (data not shown). The G11-Z polypeptide was immunoprecipitated from detergent-solubilized insect cell extracts using the T7.Tag antibody. After washing the immunoprecipitates thoroughly with 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) they were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay where it was found that the immunoprecipitates catalyzed the transfer of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP to both α-casein and histone (Fig. 2, A and B). No kinase activity was detectable in immunoprecipitates prepared from cells infected with the wild type virus (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, immunoprecipitates from insect cells infected with virus expressing an irrelevant polypeptide (a 43-kDa sialidase encoded by the gene G9 in the human MHC (13Milner C.M. Smith S.V. Carrillo M.B. Taylor G.L. Hollinshead M. Campbell R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4549-4558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)), but containing the same peptide tag, showed no evidence of any associated protein kinase activity. When the kinase assay was carried out with the G11-Z immunoprecipitates, but in the absence of substrate, no labeled bands were apparent by SDS-PAGE suggesting that the G11-Z polypeptide does not undergo autophosphorylation (data not shown). In order to determine whether the removal of the N-terminal 110 amino acid residues of G11-Z had any effect on the efficiency of the kinase activity, immunoprecipitates of cell lysates infected with G11-Y and G11-Z were incubated in the kinase assay. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the incorporation of 32P into α-casein and histone by each G11 immunoprecipitate was comparable (Fig. 2, A and B). This was confirmed in a time course experiment, but in this case in order to quantify the kinase activity the amount of radioactivity in the α-casein band on the SDS-PAGE was determined in a PhosphorImager. Fig. 2 C shows that the kinase activity in the G11-Y immunoprecipitate increased in a linear fashion with time and was comparable to the kinase activity in the G11-Z immunoprecipitate. This suggests that the segment of the G11 polypeptide between amino acids 111–368 most likely corresponds to the catalytic domain. A similar level of kinase activity (Fig. 2, A, lane 2, and C) was found to be associated with immunoprecipitates from cells infected with a G11-Y(-VCDC) construct which lacks the 4 amino acids Val-Cys-Asp-Cys compared with immunoprecipitates from cells infected with the G11-Y construct (Fig. 2, A, lane 1,and C) indicating that the absence of these four amino acids does not substantially affect the kinase activity. Several variables of the kinase reaction were examined. It was found that the optimal temperature of the reaction was 30 °C, and that the kinase activity started to be detectable after 10 min and increased in a linear fashion with time (Fig. 2 C). The enzyme had an absolute requirement for an appropriate divalent cation with a rank order of Mn2+ > Mg2+ > Mn2+/Mg2+ > Mn2+/Ca2+, and the cation was more effective at a concentration of 20 mm than at a concentration of 10 mm (data not shown). Carrying out the reaction in the presence of 20 mmCaCl2 did not lead to any detectable level of32P incorporation. The identity of the amino acids serving as phosphate acceptors in α-casein and histone during the kinase reaction using immunoprecipitates containing the G11-Y recombinant protein was determined by two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis of partially acid-hydrolyzed 32P-labeled products. As shown in Fig. 3 A the amino acid acceptors in α-casein were Ser and Thr, and in histone it was Ser only (Fig. 3 B). No tyrosine phosphorylation was observed suggesting that G11 is a Ser/Thr protein kinase. Selective labeling of protein kinases can be carried out with the reactive ATP analogue FSBA which has been shown to react with an invariant lysine residue present within the ATP-binding site of the protein kinase superfamily (18Zoller M.J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8363-8368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test this, extracts from insect cells infected with either the G11-Y recombinant virus or with the wild type virus were incubated in the kinase buffer with 1 mm FSBA for different times, in the presence or absence of 1 mm ATP. The G11-Y polypeptide was immunoprecipitated with the T7.Tag antibody and the labeling of G11-Y with FSBA was detected by immunoblotting with affinity-purified anti-FSBA antibodies. The Ser/Thr casein kinase II was used as a control to monitor the successful labeling of protein kinases with FSBA (Fig. 4, A and B, lane 5). Fig. 4 A shows a ladder of FSBA reacted proteins, all of which are detected in the sample incubated in the presence (lanes 1 and 2) or absence (lanes 3and 4) of 1 mm ATP. There is only one protein of 30 kDa, corresponding to the expected size of G11-Y, which is present in the sample incubated in the absence of 1 mm ATP (Fig. 4 A, lane 4), but which is absent in the sample incubated in the presence of 1 mm ATP (Fig. 4 A, lane 2). The 30-kDa protein is not detected in the wild type samples whether in the presence (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1 and 2) or absence (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3 and 4) of 1 mm ATP. These results showed that FSBA covalently binds to the 30-kDa G11-Y polypeptide and that this binding can be blocked by ATP, suggesting that G11-Y is capable of binding ATP. To complement the results stated above the inhibition of ATP labeling by FSBA was investigated. The results of kinase assays using the G11-Y immunoprecipitates shown in Fig. 4 C revealed that the kinase activity decreased as the concentration of FSBA increased, and was completely inhibited by 5 mm FSBA (Fig. 4 D). In order to further characterize the G11-Z protein and determine its cellular localization the entire protein-coding region of G11-Z including the T7.Tag epitope at the N-terminal end was inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 and expressed in COS-7 cells. A unique band of 41.5 kDa corresponding to G11-Z was detected with the T7.Tag antibody on Western blot analysis of lysates from G11-Z transfected cells (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1 and 2) which was not present in lysates from cells transfected with a pcDNA3-CAT construct encoding bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) (Fig. 5 A, lane 3). To identify the G11-Z enzymatic activity in transfected COS-7 cells, the G11-Z polypeptide was immunoprecipitated from cells transfected with the pcDNA3-G11Z construct using the T7.Tag antibody. As shown in Fig. 5 B (lanes 1 and 2) the G11-Z immunoprecipitates were able to catalyze the transfer of32P from [γ-32P]ATP to α-casein. No kinase activity was detectable in immunoprecipitates from COS-7 cells transiently expressing CAT (Fig. 5 B, lane 3) or the 43-kDa sialidase (13Milner C.M. Smith S.V. Carrillo M.B. Taylor G.L. Hollinshead M. Campbell R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4549-4558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) containing the same peptide tag (data not shown). To provide further evidence that G11 is a protein kinase, mutants were constructed by introducing a point mutation resulting in the conversion of a lysine to a proline at amino acids 300, 315, and 317 in the catalytic domain of the enzyme, respectively. The mutant cDNAs and the G11-Z cDNA without the T7 gene 10 peptide tag were inserted into pBK-CMV. To identify the enzymatic activity of these G11 mutants, the G11–300R, G11–315R, G11–317R, and the wild type polypeptides were immunoprecipitated from transfected COS-7 cells using the anti-G11 monoclonal antibody and subjected to a kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 6 (lane 4) when the lysine residue at amino acid 317 was converted to a proline the kinase activity was completely ablated. Furthermore, the conversion of the lysine residues at amino acids 300 and 315 to a proline resulted in a dramatic decrease in the levels of activity (lanes 2 and 3, respectively), whereas the wild type (lane 5) showed the expected levels of kinase activity. To determine the subcellular localization of the G11-Z protein, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the tagged G11-Z coding sequence or the CAT coding sequence, then stained with the T7.Tag antibody. Cells expressing the tagged G11-Z polypeptide showed an intense nuclear staining (Fig. 7,panel C). An identical pattern of nuclear staining was seen in cells when the control antibody to nuclear splicosomes was used (Fig. 7, panel B). This intense nuclear staining was not seen when COS-7 cells were transfected with the CAT construct and stained with the T7.Tag antibody (Fig. 7, panel D), or with a construct encoding the 43-kDa sialidase containing the same peptide tag which was visualized in the endoplasmic reticulum (13Milner C.M. Smith S.V. Carrillo M.B. Taylor G.L. Hollinshead M. Campbell R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4549-4558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition, a construct encoding the cytoplasmic protein HSP70-Hom with the same epitope tag at the N terminus resulted in the visualization of the expressed protein in its expected location in the cytoplasm. 2C. M. Milner and R. D. Campbell, unpublished observations. This indicates that the presence of the T7 gene 10 peptide at the N terminus of G11-Z does not affect its cellular localization. In this study we present evidence that the G11-Z polypeptide immunoprecipitated from insect cell lysates and COS-7 cell lysates has protein kinase activity that phosphorylates α-casein at Ser and Thr residues and histone at Ser residues. In addition, the kinase activity was found to have a pronounced preference for Mn2+ over Mg2+ ions. It is of particular interest that the specificity of phosphorylation is determined by divalent cations, where Mg2+ causes Ser phosphorylation of substrate and Mn2+ activates Tyr phosphorylation (19Yuan C.Y. Huang C. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17683-17686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two sequences, Asp-Leu-Lys-Leu-Asp-Asn and Thr-Pro-Glu-Phe-Leu-Ala-Pro-Glu, which structurally distinguish Ser/Thr-specific from Tyr-specific protein kinases (20Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 388-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 21Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar) are not present in the G11-Z amino acid sequence. Thus, it cannot be ruled out that G11 might phosphorylate acceptor proteins at Tyr residues in vivo. Removal of the N-terminal 110 amino acids of G11-Z to give the G11-Y construct did not appear to affect the kinase activity, suggesting that the segment of the G11 polypeptide between amino acids 111 and 368 most likely corresponds to the catalytic domain. The putative kinase domain of G11 of 258 amino acids seems to correspond to the average size of catalytic domains of some other protein kinases. For instance DBK, a novel putative Ser/Thr protein kinase has a catalytic domain that consists of 263 amino acids (22Chu W. Presky D.H. Dabho W. Swerlick R.A. Burns D.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). G11-Z does not contain the sequence Asp-Phe-Gly which is thought to be involved in the binding of ATP. However, the sequence Gly-Ala-Gly-Arg-Phe-Ile at position 294–299 matches the protein-kinase-specific ATP-binding consensus sequence Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly, except for the absence of the third Gly residue. In this respect it is of interest to note that the ATP binding sequence in the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein kinase (SRPK1), Gly-Trp-Gly-His-Phe-Ser, does not include the third Gly residue either (23Gui J.F. Lane W.S. Fu X.D. Nature. 1994; 369: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In all known protein kinases there is a highly conserved lysine residue which is thought to be involved in the binding of ATP and that lies 14 to 23 residues downstream of the last conserved glycine in the consensus sequence Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly (21Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar). Lysine residues at amino acids 300, 315, and 317 of the G11-Z sequence are therefore possible candidates. In this study we show that the conversion of the lysine residue at amino acid 317 to a proline completely ablated the enzyme activity of G11 while the kinase activity of G11–300R and G11–315R was decreased dramatically. This is consistent with our observation that G11 expressed in insect cells is capable of being covalently modified with FSBA and that this modification can be inhibited by ATP. These results provide direct evidence that the G11 protein possesses a phosphotransferase activity. Sequence analysis of PCR products generated by amplification of reverse transcribed RNA from a number of different cell lines has shown the presence of sequences that contained a 12-bp insertion (7Sargent C.A. Anderson M.J. Hsieh S.L. Kendall E. Gomez-Escobar N. Campbell R.D. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1994; 3: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) between nucleotides 790 and 791 of the G11-Z cDNA sequence. This 4-amino acid difference is quite important as it results in the expression of G11 polypeptides which contain or lack the sequence Val-Cys-Asp-Cys in the kinase domain. However, a similar level of kinase activity was found to be associated with immunoprecipitates from cells infected with the G11-Y(-VCDC) construct compared with cells infected with the G11-Y construct suggesting that the absence of these 4 amino acids does not significantly affect the kinase activity associated with the G11 protein. The region that is not included in the catalytic domain of protein kinases plays a major role in the regulation of the kinase activity. It is interesting to note that the N-terminal end of the G11 protein contains potential sites of phosphorylation at Ser/Thr and Tyr residues (7Sargent C.A. Anderson M.J. Hsieh S.L. Kendall E. Gomez-Escobar N. Campbell R.D. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1994; 3: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), suggesting that its function may be modulated through phosphorylation by other protein kinases. Sequence analysis of G11-Z showed the presence of a specific bipartite nuclear target sequence (24Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar, 25Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar) between amino acids 114 and 131 (KRHHLIPPETFGVKRRRKR). The functional consequence of the presence of this sequence in G11-Z was experimentally supported when COS-7 cells transfected with the G11-Z coding sequence revealed intense staining of the nucleus. The similarity of the G11-Z protein with nuclear proteins was further indicated by the presence of one putative kinase C phosphorylation site (amino acid 112) near the nuclear target sequence. Phosphorylation near nuclear target sequences has been proposed to accelerate the rate of nuclear uptake and to play a role in cell cycle dependent control of nuclear entry of oncogene products and of transcription factors (24Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Protein kinases control a wide range of cellular events and in many cases individual enzymes are involved in the regulation of multiple different processes. Therefore, it is important that these enzymes select the correct substrates at the correct time to coordinate the complex organization of cellular events. One factor involved in substrate selection is substrate structure (26Kemp B.E. Parker M.W. Hu S. Tiganis T. House C. Trends Genet. 1994; 19: 440-444Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, studies have also shown that another major factor determining target specificity may be the restricted subcellular distribution of kinase activities, through the subcellular compartmentalization of the enzymes or their activators (26Kemp B.E. Parker M.W. Hu S. Tiganis T. House C. Trends Genet. 1994; 19: 440-444Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This suggests that the substrate of G11-Z is located in the nucleus and that through phosphorylation G11-Z might be involved in the regulation of transcription in the nucleus.

https://openalex.org/W2085518295,"Nitric oxide (NO) is thought to play an important role in neurotransmission, inflammation, and regulation of cell death in the mammalian brain. Here, we examined the synthesis and biological effects of NO in human malignant glioma cells. Exposure to cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha or interleukin (IL)-1beta and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced NO synthesis in rat C6 and A172 human glioma cells, but not in LN-229, T98G or LN-18 human malignant glioma cells. Induced release of NO involved enhanced expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS). Failure to detect NO release in the latter cell lines was not overcome by neutralization of endogenous TGF-beta or by coexposure to cytokines, LPS, and antioxidants. Apoptosis induced by CD95 ligand (CD95L) did not involve NO formation. Neither NOS inhibitors nor NO donators modulated CD95L-induced apoptosis. Dexamethasone (DEX)-mediated protection of glioma cells from CD95L-induced apoptosis was also independent of DEX effects on NO metabolism. DEX inhibited not only cytokine/LPS-evoked NO release but also attenuated the toxicity of NO in three of five cell lines. Forced expression of temperature-sensitive p53 val135 in C6 cells in either mutant or wild-type conformation inhibited cytokine/LPS-induced NO synthesis. Further, accumulation of p53 in both mutant or wild-type conformation protected glioma cells from the toxicity of exogenous NO, consistent with a gain of p53 function associated with p53 accumulation. We conclude that resistance to NO-dependent immune defense mechanisms may contribute to the malignant progression of human cancers with p53 alterations, notably those associated with the accumulation of mutant p53 protein."

https://openalex.org/W2323569903,"Human lymphoblastoid cells were transfected with expression vectors containing p53 cDNA mutated at either codon 135 or 246. The cells were subjected to cisplatin treatment or γ-radiation and observed for changes in the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We found that compared to the parental cell line, cells overexpressing mutant p53 (either 246val or 135ser) exhibited decreased apoptosis in response to γ-radiation or cisplatin as measured by: propidium iodide (PI) staining of the cellular DNA (cell cycle analysis) and decrease in PARP (poly ADP-ribose polymerase) cleavage as detected by Western blotting. Interestingly the cells expressing mutant p53(135ser) protein were less resistant to cisplatin-induced apoptosis than the p53(246val)-bearing cell line. A significant decrease in the G1/S arrest assayed by bromodeoxyuridine and PI staining (cell cycle/proliferation assay) was also observed in response to irradiation and cisplatin in cell lines expressing either of the mutant p53 constructs. A lower basal level and reduced magnitude of protein induction of the cell cycle inhibitor p21/Waf1 was seen both after cisplatin and γ-radiation treatment in the mutant p53 expressing lymphoblastoid variant when compared to the wild type p53 parental cell line but induction of the p53 regulator MDM2 was comparable in both. No increase in basal levels of Bc12 protein in wild type or mutant p53 expressing cells was observed in response to cisplatin or irradiation. Unexpectedly, following cisplatin treatment we observed an increase in mutant and wild type p53 RNA steady state levels in addition to increased levels of p53 protein. These results suggest that irradiation or cisplatin treatment may not only stabilize wild type p53 protein but also may increase the steady state p53 RNA levels. Finally these results indicate that both irradiation and cisplatin should be used with caution in the treatment of lymphoid tumors bearing mutations of p53."

https://openalex.org/W2317707682,"People carrying a mutant BRCA2 gene are susceptible to breast, ovarian, pancreatic and other tumors. Many facets of BRCA2 have been studied, including its mutation in human cancers, its role in mouse embryogenesis and its RNA expression in different tissues and different mouse embryogenesis stages. However, there has been very little characterization of BRCA2 protein. We investigated the biochemical and biological properties of BRCA2 by using a monoclonal antibody we generated against the N-terminal portion of BRCA2. We discovered that the detection of BRCA2 by immunoblot analysis was sensitive to the temperature used to denature the samples before gel electrophoresis. BRCA2 was easily detectable when samples were denatured at low temperature instead of boiling. Although the precise mechanism underlying this observation is not clear yet, this finding will significantly improve our ability to study BRCA2. We examined the expression of BRCA2 using an immunoblot analysis protocol modified according to this observation. We showed that BRCA2 was presented in every human cell lines examined, including Capan-1, which expressed a truncated BRCA2 due to a BRCA2 frameshift mutation. We also showed that the expression of BRCA2 was cell-cycle regulated. Our results suggest that BRCA2 has an important role in cell growth regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2335302163,"Tumour suppressor protein p53 is the most frequent target of mutations occurring in different types of human cancers. Most of these are point mutations clustered in certain `hot spots'. Because p53 is a tetramer in solution, it can form heterooligomers when both wild-type and mutant forms of p53 are expressed in the same cell. Inactivation of wt p53 by heterooligomerization has been proposed as a mechanism for dominant negative effect of mutant protein. In this paper we show that other mechanisms can also be involved in the inhibition of transcriptional activity of wt p53 by mutant proteins. In addition to suppressing the wt p53 activity, mutant proteins are also able to suppress the activity of p53 protein unable to oligomerize. Either N- or C-terminus of mutant p53 are needed for this activity. The suppression of transcriptional activity described is restricted to p53-dependent promoters and no effect is seen with the promoter not containing p53 binding site. Point mutants also inhibit the growth suppressing activity of monomeric p53. Our data allow to propose the existence of a cofactor specifically needed for p53-dependent transcription. Depletion of this cofactor could be an alternative mechanism of inactivation of wt p53 by its point mutants."
