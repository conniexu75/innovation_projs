https://openalex.org/W2113855826,"Current-induced switching in the orientation of magnetic moments is observed in cobalt/copper/cobalt sandwich structures, for currents flowing perpendicularly through the layers. Magnetic domains in adjacent cobalt layers can be manipulated controllably between stable parallel and antiparallel configurations by applying current pulses of the appropriate sign. The observations are in accord with predictions that a spin-polarized current exerts a torque at the interface between a magnetic and nonmagnetic metal, due to local exchange interactions between conduction electrons and the magnetic moments."
https://openalex.org/W1966761076,"Shank is a recently described family of postsynaptic proteins that function as part of the NMDA receptor-associated PSD-95 complex (Naisbitt et al., 1999 [this issue of Neuron]). Here, we report that Shank proteins also bind to Homer. Homer proteins form multivalent complexes that bind proline-rich motifs in group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors and inositol trisphosphate receptors, thereby coupling these receptors in a signaling complex. A single Homer-binding site is identified in Shank, and Shank and Homer coimmunoprecipitate from brain and colocalize at postsynaptic densities. Moreover, Shank clusters mGluR5 in heterologous cells in the presence of Homer and mediates the coclustering of Homer with PSD-95/GKAP. Thus, Shank may cross-link Homer and PSD-95 complexes in the PSD and play a role in the signaling mechanisms of both mGluRs and NMDA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2019873695,"NMDA receptors are linked to intracellular cytoskeletal and signaling molecules via the PSD-95 protein complex. We report a novel family of postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins, termed Shank, that binds via its PDZ domain to the C terminus of PSD-95-associated protein GKAP. A ternary complex of Shank/GKAP/PSD-95 assembles in heterologous cells and can be coimmunoprecipitated from rat brain. Synaptic localization of Shank in neurons is inhibited by a GKAP splice variant that lacks the Shank-binding C terminus. In addition to its PDZ domain, Shank contains a proline-rich region that binds to cortactin and a SAM domain that mediates multimerization. Shank may function as a scaffold protein in the PSD, potentially cross-linking NMDA receptor/PSD-95 complexes and coupling them to regulators of the actin cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W1988130027,"The imaging telescope on board the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) spacecraft observed the decaying transversal oscillations of a long [(130 +/- 6) x 10(6) meters], thin [diameter (2.0 +/- 0.36) x 10(6) meters], bright coronal loop in the 171 angstrom Fe(IX) emission line. The oscillations were excited by a solar flare in the adjacent active region. The decay time of the oscillations is 14.5 +/- 2.7 minutes for an oscillation with a frequency 3.90 +/- 0.13 millihertz. The coronal dissipation coefficient is estimated to be eight to nine orders of magnitude larger than the theoretically predicted classical value. The larger dissipation coefficient may solve existing difficulties with wave heating and reconnection theories."
https://openalex.org/W2042008519,"The global expansion of C 4 grasslands in the late Miocene has been attributed to a large-scale decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentrations. This triggering mechanism is controversial, in part because of a lack of direct evidence for change in the partial pressure of CO 2 ( p CO 2 ) and because other factors are also important determinants in controlling plant-type distributions. Alkenone-based p CO 2 estimates for the late Miocene indicate that p CO 2 increased from 14 to 9 million years ago and stabilized at preindustrial values by 9 million years ago. The estimates presented here provide no evidence for major changes in p CO 2 during the late Miocene. Thus, C 4 plant expansion was likely driven by additional factors, possibly a tectonically related episode of enhanced low-latitude aridity or changes in seasonal precipitation patterns on a global scale (or both)."
https://openalex.org/W2043136696,"In response to DNA damage and replication blocks, cells activate pathways that arrest the cell cycle and induce the transcription of genes that facilitate repair. In mammals, ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) kinase together with other checkpoint kinases are important components in this response. We have cloned the rat and human homologs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad 53 and Schizosaccharomyces pombe Cds1, called checkpoint kinase 2 (chk2). Complementation studies suggest that Chk2 can partially replace the function of the defective checkpoint kinase in the Cds1 deficient yeast strain. Chk2 was phosphorylated and activated in response to DNA damage in an ATM dependent manner. Its activation in response to replication blocks by hydroxyurea (HU) treatment, however, was independent of ATM. Using mass spectrometry, we found that, similar to Chk1, Chk2 can phosphorylate serine 216 in Cdc25C, a site known to be involved in negative regulation of Cdc25C. These results suggest that Chk2 is a downstream effector of the ATM-dependent DNA damage checkpoint pathway. Activation of Chk2 might not only delay mitotic entry, but also increase the capacity of cultured cells to survive after treatment with gamma-radiation or with the topoisomerase-I inhibitor topotecan."
https://openalex.org/W1971754431,"Pain is unique among sensations in that the perceived intensity increases, or sensitizes, during exposure to a strong stimulus. One important mediator of sensitization is bradykinin (BK), a peptide released as a consequence of tissue damage. BK enhances the membrane ionic current activated by heat in nociceptive neurons, using a pathway that involves activation of protein kinase C (PKC). We find that five PKC isoforms are present in sensory neurons but that only PKC-epsilon is translocated to the cell membrane by BK. The heat response is sensitized when constitutively active PKC-epsilon is incorporated into nociceptive neurons. Conversely, BK-induced sensitization is suppressed by a specific peptide inhibitor of PKC-epsilon. We conclude that PKC-epsilon is principally responsible for sensitization of the heat response in nociceptors by bradykinin."

The field pulses are applied in the plane of the film, and their direction encompasses all angles with the magnetization. At a right angle to the magnetization, maximum torque is exerted on the spins. In this geometry, a precessional magnetization reversal can be triggered by fields as small as 184 kiloamperes per meter. Applications in future ultrafast magnetic recording schemes can be foreseen."
https://openalex.org/W2080229244,"Lead, oxygen, and osmium isotopic ratios measured on Hawaiian basalts can be matched with the isotopic ratios inferred for recycled ancient oceanic crust. High-precision hafnium isotopic data for lavas from several Hawaiian volcanoes identify old pelagic sediments in their source. These observations support the recycling hypothesis, whereby the mantle source of ocean island basalts includes ancient subducted oceanic crust. Hyperbolic lead-hafnium isotopic relations among Hawaiian basalts further indicate that upper mantle material is not involved in the production of hot spot basalts."
https://openalex.org/W1990057321,"Many neurosecretory preparations display two components of depolarization-induced exocytosis: a phasic component synchronized with Ca2+ channel opening, followed by a slower sustained component. We evaluated possible mechanisms underlying this biphasic behavior by stimulating mouse chromaffin cells in situ with both depolarizations and flash photolysis of caged Ca2+. From a direct comparison of the secretory responses to both stimuli, we conclude that phasic and sustained release components originate from a readily releasable pool (RRP) of equally fusion-competent vesicles, suggesting that differences in the vesicles' proximity to Ca2+ channels underlie the biphasic secretory behavior. An intermediate pool in dynamic equilibrium with the RRP ensures rapid recruitment of release-ready vesicles after RRP depletion. Our results are discussed in terms of a refined model for secretion in chromaffin cells."
https://openalex.org/W2026402396,"Calcium-permeable, stretch-activated nonselective cation (SA Cat) channels mediate cellular responses to mechanical stimuli. However, genes encoding such channels have not been identified in eukaryotes. The yeast MID1 gene product (Mid1) is required for calcium influx in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Functional expression of Mid1 in Chinese hamster ovary cells conferred sensitivity to mechanical stress that resulted in increases in both calcium conductance and the concentration of cytosolic free calcium. These increases were dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium and were reduced by gadolinium, a blocker of SA Cat channels. Single-channel analyses with cell-attached patches revealed that Mid1 acts as a calcium-permeable, cation-selective stretch-activated channel with a conductance of 32 picosiemens at 150 millimolar cesium chloride in the pipette. Thus, Mid1 appears to be a eukaryotic, SA Cat channel."

https://openalex.org/W2166549355,"Biochemical studies suggest that syntaxin 1A participates in multiple protein-protein interactions in the synaptic terminal, but the in vivo significance of these interactions is poorly understood. We used a targeted mutagenesis approach to eliminate specific syntaxin binding interactions and demonstrate that Drosophila syntaxin 1A plays multiple regulatory roles in neurotransmission in vivo. Syntaxin mutations that eliminate ROP/Munc-18 binding display increased neurotransmitter release, suggesting that ROP inhibits neurosecretion through its interaction with syntaxin. Syntaxin mutations that block Ca2+ channel binding also cause an increase in neurotransmitter release, suggesting that syntaxin normally functions in inhibiting Ca2+ channel opening. Additionally, we identify and characterize a syntaxin Ca2+ effector domain, which may spatially organize the Ca2+ channel, cysteine string protein, and synaptotagmin for effective excitation-secretion coupling in the presynaptic terminal."
https://openalex.org/W2038405912,"Recently, it has been shown that cerebellar LTD has a late phase that may be blocked by protein synthesis inhibitors. To understand the mechanisms underlying the late phase, we interfered with the activation of transcription factors that might couple synaptic activation to protein synthesis. Particle-mediated transfection of cultured Purkinje neurons with an expression vector encoding a dominant inhibitory form of CREB resulted in a nearly complete blockade of the late phase. Kinases that activate CREB were inhibited, and LTD was assessed. Inhibition of PKA or the MAPK/RSK cascades were without effect on the late phase, while constructs designed to interfere with CaMKIV function attenuated the late phase. These results indicate that the activation of CaMKIV and CREB are necessary to establish a late phase of cerebellar LTD."
https://openalex.org/W2018787680,"To assess the role of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in skin carcinogenesis by UV radiation, mice constitutively lacking one or both copies of the functional p53 gene were compared to wild-type mice for their susceptibility to UV carcinogenesis. Heterozygous mice showed greatly increased susceptibility to skin cancer induction, and homozygous p53 knockout mice were even more susceptible. Accelerated tumor development in the heterozygotes was not associated with loss of the remaining wild-type allele of p53, as reported for tumors induced by other carcinogens, but in many cases was associated with UV-induced mutations in p53. Tumors arose on the ears and dorsal skin of mice of all three genotypes, and homozygous knockout mice also developed ocular tumors, mainly melanomas. Skin tumors in the p53 knockout mice were predominately squamous cell carcinomas and were associated with premalignant lesions resembling actinic keratoses, whereas those in the heterozygous and wild-type mice were mainly sarcomas. These results demonstrate the importance of p53 in protecting against UV-induced cancers, particularly in the eye and epidermis."
https://openalex.org/W2064656154,"Diamond is a remarkable mineral and has been long recognized for its unusual physical and chemical properties: robust and widespread in industry, yet regally adorned. This diversity is even greater than formally appreciated because diamond is recognized as an extraordinary recorder of astrophysical and geodynamic events that extend from the far reaches of space to Earth's deep interior. Many diamonds are natural antiques that formed in presolar supernovae by carbon vapor deposition, in asteroidal impacts and meteorite craters by shock metamorphism, and in Earth's mantle 1 to 2 billion years after planetary accretion from fluids and melts. The carbon in diamond is primordial, but there are unexplained isotopic fractionations and uncertainties in heterogeneity."
https://openalex.org/W2319831517,"We have examined potential mechanisms by which the Pim-1 kinase acts as a hematopoietic cell survival factor. Enforced expression of the wild type 33 kd (FD/hpim33) and 44 kd (FD/mpim44) Pim-1 proteins in murine factor-dependent FDCP1 cells prolonged survival after withdrawal of IL-3, while expression of a dominant negative Pim-1 protein (FD/pimNT81) shortened survival. Following removal of IL-3 FDCP1 cells exhibited loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and production of reactive oxygen species, as determined by flow cytometry analysis. The wild type Pim-1 proteins decreased these changes while the dominant negative protein enhanced mitochondrial dysfunction. The antiapoptotic activity of the kinases could not be attributed to modulation of glutathione, catalase, or superoxide dismutase activities. Both the FD/hpim33 and FD/mpim44 cells maintained expression of bcl-2 mRNA following cytokine removal, while a substantial decrease was seen in FD/neo cells. To modulate Bcl-2 protein levels, a bcl-2 antisense RNA construct was coexpressed with the wild type pim-1 cDNAs. FD/hpim33 cells with low cellular Bcl-2 protein levels had shortened cytokine-independent survival compared with FD/hpim33 clones with high Bcl-2 expression. However survival of FD/mpim44 cells after IL-3 withdrawal was substantially independent of cellular Bcl-2 protein levels. The 33 kd protein delayed, and the 44 kd protein completely prevented enhanced cell death associated with enforced expression of human Bax protein however. Our results suggest that the 33 kd Pim-1 kinase may enhance cell survival through cooperation with and regulation of bcl-2. In addition the 44 kd kinase may regulate the expression or activity of other pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the bcl-2 family."
https://openalex.org/W2027431258,"To determine the frequency of Wnt/Wingless β catenin pathway alteration in human hepatocellular carcinoma, a β catenin and APC gene mutation screening was performed in a series of 119 tumors. An activating β catenin mutation in exon 3 was found in 18% of the cases. Among tumors lacking β catenin mutation, no APC mutation has been evidenced in a subset of 30 cases tested. The correlation between β catenin mutation status and chromosome segment deletions was studied on a set of 48 hyperploid tumors. Chromosome 1p, 4q and 16p deletions were significantly associated with the absence of β catenin mutation (P<0.05). Furthermore the Fractional Allelic Loss was significantly smaller in the β catenin mutated tumors than in the non-mutated tumors (0.12 versus 022). Taken together, these results suggest, the existence of two carcinogenesis mechanisms. The first mechanism implies a β catenin activating mutation associated with a low rate of loss of heterozygosity. The second mechanism, operating in a context of chromosomal instability, would involve tumor suppressor genes."
https://openalex.org/W2318698183,"Activation of the Jak/STAT pathway by cytokines has been shown to regulate differentiation, proliferation or apoptosis in hematopoeitic cells. Among the Stat proteins, STAT5 is activated by a broad range of cytokines. In order to study the role of STAT5 in hematopoietic cells, we stably expressed a dominant negative form of STAT5 (STAT5A delta749) in the IL-3 dependent bone marrow derived Ba/F3 cell line. Ba/F3 cells expressing STAT5A delta749 were found to be more sensitive to apoptosis than parental or control Ba/F3 cells after IL-3 withdrawal. Analysis of the expression of the cell death regulators, Bcl-2 and Bcl-x, revealed that the level of Bcl-x was lower in Ba/F3 cells expressing STAT5A delta749 than in control cells. IL-3 regulation of Bcl-x expression at protein and mRNA levels was impaired in these cells while that of Bcl-2 expression was unaffected. We further demonstrated that the Bcl-x gene promoter contained a proximal STAT consensus sequence that bound STAT5. Transactivation of a Bcl-x gene promoter reporter construct by STAT5 was observed in Ba/F3 cells. Introduction of a mutation in the STAT binding site abolished this transactivation. These data indicate that Bcl-x is probably a STAT5 target gene. They also support the involvement of STAT5 in hematopoietic cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W2009135380,"A20 is a Cys2/Cys2 zinc finger protein which is induced by a variety of inflammatory stimuli and which has been characterized as an inhibitor of cell death by a yet unknown mechanism. In order to clarify its molecular mechanism of action, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen for proteins that interact with A20. A cDNA fragment was isolated which encoded a portion of a novel protein (TXBP151), which was recently found to be a human T-cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I) Tax-binding protein. The full-length 2386 bp TXBP151 mRNA encodes a protein of 86 kDa. Like A20, overexpression of TXBP151 could inhibit apoptosis induced by tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in NIH3T3 cells. Moreover, transfection of antisense TXBP151 partially abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of A20. Furthermore, apoptosis induced by TNF or CD95 (Fas/APO-1) was associated with proteolysis of TXBP151. This degradation could be inhibited by the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk or by expression of the cowpox virus-derived inhibitor CrmA, suggesting that TXBP151 is a novel substrate for caspase family members. TXBP151 was indeed found to be specifically cleaved in vitro by members of the caspase-3-like subfamily, viz. caspase-3, caspase-6 and caspase-7. Thus TXBP151 appears to be a novel A20-binding protein which might mediate the anti-apoptotic activity of A20, and which can be processed by specific caspases."
https://openalex.org/W2325725181,"Loss of telomeric repeats during cell proliferation could play a role in senescence. It has been generally assumed that activation of telomerase prevents further telomere shortening and is essential for cell immortalization. In this study, we performed a detailed cytogenetic and molecular characterization of four SV40 transformed human fibroblastic cell lines by regularly monitoring the size distribution of terminal restriction fragments, telomerase activity and the associated chromosomal instability throughout immortalization. The mean TRF lengths progressively decreased in pre-crisis cells during the lifespan of the cultures. At crisis, telomeres reached a critical size, different among the cell lines, contributing to the peak of dicentric chromosomes, which resulted mostly from telomeric associations. We observed a direct correlation between short telomere length at crisis and chromosomal instability. In two immortal cell lines, although telomerase was detected, mean telomere length still continued to decrease whereas the number of dicentric chromosomes associated was stabilized. Thus telomerase could protect specifically telomeres which have reached a critical size against end-to-end dicentrics, while long telomeres continue to decrease, although at a slower rate as before crisis. This suggests a balance between elongation by telomerase and telomere shortening, towards a stabilized 'optimal' length."

https://openalex.org/W2333925163,"Amplification of several chromosomal regions have been observed in human breast carcinomas. One such region, 8p11, is amplified in 10 – 15% of tumor samples. Although the FGFR1 gene is located close to this region, and is often included within the amplicon, the observation that tumors exhibiting 8p11 amplification do not always overexpress FGFR1 suggests that another gene located close to FGFR1 is involved in the tumorigenic process. We now report the precise location of four expressed sequence tags (ESTs) within this region and the cloning of a novel gene, designated TACC1 (transforming acidic coiled coil gene 1), which encodes an 8 kb transcript and which is expressed at high levels during early embryogenesis. Constitutive expression of this gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter in mouse fibroblasts, results in cellular transformation and anchorage independent growth, suggesting that inappropriate expression can impart a proliferative advantage. This observation raises the possibility that amplification of TACC1 could promote malignant growth, thereby making TACC1 an attractive candidate for the gene promoting tumorigenicity as a result of the 8p11 amplification in human breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2312951294,"Gas6 is a growth factor membrane of the vitamin K-dependent family of proteins which is preferentially expressed in quiescent cells. Gas6 was identified as the ligand for Axl tyrosine kinase receptor family. Consistent with this, Gas6 was previously reported to induce cell cycle re-entry of serum-starved NIH3T3 cells and to prevent cell death after complete growth factor withdrawal, the survival effect being uncoupled from Gas6-induced mitogenesis. We have previously demonstrated that both Gas6 mitogenic and survival effects are mediated by Src and the phosphatidylinositol3-OH kinase (PI3K). Here we report that Ras is required for Gas6 mitogenesis but is dispensable for its survival effect. Gas6-induced survival requires the activity of the small GTPases of the Rho family, Rac and Rho, together with the downstream kinase Pak. Overexpression of the respective dominant negative constructs abrogates Gas6-mediated survival functions. Addition of Gas6 to serum starved cells results in the activation of AKT/PKB and in the phosphorylation of the Bcl-2 family member, Bad. By ectopic expression of a catalytically inactive form of AKT/PKB, we demonstrate that AKT/PKB is necessary for Gas6-mediated survival functions. We further show evidence that Gas6 stimulation of serum starved NIH3T3 cells results in a transient ERK, JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK activation. Blocking ERK activation did not influence Gas6-induced survival, suggesting that such pathway is not involved in Gas6 protection from cell death. On the contrary we found that the late constitutive increase of p38 MAPK activity associated with cell death was downregulated in Gas6-treated NIH3T3 cells thus suggesting that Gas6 might promote survival by interfering with this pathway. Taken together the evidence here provided identity elements involved in Gas6 signalling more specifically elucidating the pathway responsible for Gas6-induced cell survival under conditions that do not allow cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2078209674,"The tumor suppressor gene PTEN (MMAC1, TEP1) encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase and is considered a progression-associated target of genetic alterations in human gliomas. Recently, it has been reported that the introduction of wild type PTEN into glioma cells containing endogenous mutant PTEN alleles (U87MG, LN-308), but not in those which retain wild-type PTEN (LN-18, LN-229), causes growth suppression and inhibits cellular migration, spreading and focal adhesion. Here, we show that PTEN gene transfer has no effect on the chemosensitivity of the four cell lines. Further, a correlational analysis of the endogenous PTEN status of 12 human glioma cell lines with their sensitivity to seven different cancer chemotherapy drugs reveals no link between PTEN and chemosensitivity. In contrast, ectopic expression of wild type PTEN, but not the PTEN(G129R) mutant, in PTEN-mutant gliomas markedly sensitizes these cells to irradiation and to CD95-ligand (CD95L)-induced apoptosis. PTEN-mediated facilitation of CD95L-induced apoptosis is associated with enhanced CD95L-evoked caspase 3 activity. Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), previously shown to inhibit CD95L-induced apoptosis in nonglial COS7 cells, is inactivated by dephosphorylation. Interestingly, both PTEN-mutant U87MG and PTEN-wild-type LN-229 cells contain phosphorylated PKB constitutively. Wild-type PTEN gene transfer promotes dephosphorylation of PKB specifically in U87MG cells but not in LN-229 cells. Sensitization of U87MG cells to CD95L-apoptosis by wild-type PTEN is blocked by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). The protection by IGF-1 is inhibited by the phosphoinositide 3-OH (PI 3) kinase inhibitor, wortmannin. Although PKB is a down-stream target of PI 3 kinase, the protection by IGF-1 was not associated with the reconstitution of PKB phosphorylation. Thus, PTEN may sensitize human malignant glioma cells to CD95L-induced apoptosis in a PI 3 kinase-dependent manner that may not require PKB phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1967237098,"Prostate cancer cells derived from transgenic mice with adenocarcinoma of the prostate (TRAMP cells) were treated with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, lovastatin. This caused inactivation of the small GTPase RhoA, actin stress fiber disassembly, cell rounding, growth arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, cell detachment and apoptosis. Addition of geranylgeraniol (GGOL) in the presence of lovastatin, to stimulate protein geranylgeranylation, prevented lovastatin's effects. That is, RhoA was activated, actin stress fibers were assembled, the cells assumed a flat morphology and cell growth resumed. The following observations support an essential role for RhoA in TRAMP cell growth: (1) TRAMP cells expressing dominant-negative RhoA (T19N) mutant protein displayed few actin stress fibers and grew at a slower rate than controls (35 h doubling time for cells expressing RhoA (T19N) vs 20 h for untransfected cells); (2) TRAMP cells expressing constitutively active RhoA (Q63L) mutant protein displayed a contractile phenotype and grew faster than controls (13 h doubling time). Interestingly, addition of farnesol (FOL) with lovastatin, to stimulate protein farnesylation, prevented lovastatin-induced cell rounding, cell detachment and apoptosis, and stimulated cell spreading to a spindle shaped morphology. However, RhoA remained inactive and growth arrest persisted. The morphological effects of FOL addition were prevented in TRAMP cells expressing dominant-negative H-Ras (T17N) mutant protein. Thus, it appears that H-Ras is capable of inducing cell spreading, but incapable of supporting cell proliferation, in the absence of geranylgeranylated proteins like RhoA."

https://openalex.org/W1973365686,"Loss of chromosome 6q21-qter is the second most frequent loss of chromosomal material in sporadic breast neoplasms suggesting the presence of at least one tumor suppressor gene on 6q. We recently isolated a cDNA encoding a new zinc finger protein which we named ZAC according to its functional properties, namely induction of apoptosis and control of cell cycle progression. ZAC is expressed in normal mammary gland and maps to 6q24-q25, a recognized breast cancer hot spot on 6q. In the present report, we investigated the possible inactivation of ZAC in breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors. We detected no mutation in ZAC coding region in a panel of 45 breast tumors with allelic imbalance of 6q24-q25. However, a survey of eight breast cancer cell lines showed a deeply reduced (three cell lines) or complete loss of (five cell lines) ZAC expression. Treatment of three of these cell lines with the methylation-interfering agent 5-azacytidine induced ZAC re-expression. In addition, Northern blot and RNase protection assay analysis of ZAC expression in 23 unselected primary breast tumors showed a reduced expression in several samples. Together with its functional properties and chromosomal localization, these findings substantiate ZAC as a good candidate for the tumor suppressor gene on 6q24-q25."
https://openalex.org/W2078190250,"Tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a potent transcriptional regulator which can activate or repress specific cellular genes and has been proposed to contribute to leukemogenic processes in adult T-cell leukemia. The molecular mechanism of Tax-mediated trans-activation has been well investigated. However, trans-repression by Tax remains to be studied in detail, although it is known to require a specific DNA element such as E-box or p53 binding site. Examining possible mechanisms of trans-repression, we found that co-expression of E47 and p300 activated E-box dependent transcription and this activation was efficiently repressed by Tax. In this system, Tax bound to p300 and decreased the level of p300 complexed on the E-box element. Similarly, Tax inhibited transcription directed by p53 and CBP, reducing the level of CBP on the p53 binding site. These results indicate that Tax interferes with recruitment of CBP/p300 into protein complexes on E-box and p53 binding site through its binding to CBP/p300. In contrast to these findings, we observed that Tax increased the level of CBP on the viral 21-bp enhancer which is trans-activated by Tax. From these observations, we propose a universal mechanism for Tax-mediated trans-repression and trans-activation of transcription in which Tax binds to CBP/p300 and determines the accessibility of CBP/p300 to protein complexes on specific DNA element."
https://openalex.org/W1991896265,"Attenuation of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling by the ganglioside GM3 has previously been found to involve activation of an unknown protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP). In transient expression experiments we tested different PTPs for activation towards EGF receptor by GM3. The transmembrane PTP RPTPσ but not RPTPα or the SH2-domain PTP SHP-1 exhibited elevated activity towards EGF receptor in GM3-treated cells. The possible relevance of RPTPσ for regulation of EGF receptor signaling activity was further explored in stable A431 cells lines inducibly expressing RPTPσ or RPTPσ antisense RNA. RPTPσ expression clearly reduced EGF receptor phosphorylation. Also, soft agar colony formation of respective cell lines was reduced upon RPTPσ expression whereas RPTPσ antisense RNA expression augmented both, EGF receptor phosphorylation and soft agar colony formation. In addition, RPTPσ antisense RNA expression rendered A431 cells resistant to inhibition of EGF receptor phosphorylation by GM3. We propose that RPTPσ participates in EGF receptor dephosphorylation in A431 cells, becomes activated by GM3 via an unknown mechanism and is thereby capable to mediate attenuation of EGF receptor phosphorylation by GM3."
https://openalex.org/W2326963540,"Ewing's sarcoma (EWS) cells accumulate elevated steady-state levels of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) mRNA and protein. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying PARP upregulation, we cloned and analysed the 5'-flanking region of the PARP gene from EWS cells. Nucleotide sequence analysis demonstrated no variations in the PARP promoter region in EWS cells. The PARP promoter encompasses multiple binding motifs for the ETS transcription factor. We have also observed that there is a coordinated up-regulation of the expression of both PARP and ETS1, relative to cells of other human tumor types expressing lower levels of PARP. Transient co-expression of ETS1 in EWS cells resulted in a strong enhancement of PARP-promoter activity. The participation of ETS in the regulation of PARP gene expression was further demonstrated in EWS cells stably transfected with Ets1 antisense cDNA constructs. Antisense-mediated down-regulation of endogenous ETS1 resulted in the inhibition of PARP expression in EWS cells, and sensitized these cells to ionizing radiation. These data provide support for ETS regulation of PARP expression levels, and implicate ETS transcription factors in the radiation response of EWS cells."

Three distinct components make up Io's visible emissions. Bright blue glows of more than 300 kilorayleighs emanate from volcanic plumes, probably due to electron impact on molecular sulfur dioxide. Weaker red emissions, possibly due to atomic oxygen, are seen along the limbs, brighter on the pole closest to the plasma torus. A faint green glow appears concentrated on the night side of Io, possibly produced by atomic sodium. Io's disk-averaged emission diminishes with time after entering eclipse, whereas the localized blue glows brighten instead."

In this study, we demonstrated that HOXB7, one member of this family, behaved as a transactivator in breast cancer cells. Deletion of either the HOXB7 N-terminal domain or the C-terminal acidic tail abolished this transcriptional effect, suggesting a combination of distinct functional transactivating domains. HOXB7 physically interacted both in vitro and in vivo with the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP). This interaction led to an enhanced transactivating potential and required the N-terminal of HOXB7 as well as two domains located at the C-terminal part of CBP. Moreover, trichostatin A, a deacetylase inhibitor, strongly enhanced the transcriptional properties of HOXB7. Our data therefore indicate that HOX proteins can directly interact with CBP and that acetylation/deacetylation may regulate their transcriptional properties."
https://openalex.org/W2328238139,"TPR-MET, a transforming counterpart of the c-MET proto-oncogene detected in experimental and human cancer, results from fusion of the MET kinase domain with a dimerization motif encoded by TPR. In this rearrangement the exons encoding the Met extracellular, transmembrane and juxtamembrane domains are lost. The juxtamembrane domain has been suggested to be a regulatory region endowed with negative feedback control. To understand whether its absence is critical for the generation of the Tpr-Met transforming potential, we produced a chimeric molecule (Tpr-juxtaMet) with a conserved juxtamembrane domain. The presence of the domain (aa 962-1009) strongly inhibited Tpr-Met dependent cell transformation. Cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, motility and invasion were also impaired. The enzymatic behavior of Tpr-Met and Tpr-juxtaMet was the same, while Tpr-juxtaMet ability to associate cytoplasmic signal transducers and to elicit downstream signaling was severely impaired. These data indicate that the presence of the juxtamembrane domain counterbalances the Tpr-Met transforming potential and therefore the loss of the exon encoding the juxtamembrane domain is crucial in the generation of the active TPR-MET oncogene."
https://openalex.org/W2331293697,"Levels of Purα, a protein implicated in control of both DNA replication and gene transcription, fluctuate during the cell cycle, being lowest in early S phase and highest just after mitosis. Here we have employed a new video time-lapse technique enabling us to determine the cell cycle position of each cell in an asynchronous culture at a given time and to ask whether introduction of Purα protein at specific times can affect cell cycle progression. Approximately 80% of all NIH3T3 cells injected with Purα were inhibited from passing through mitosis. Cells injected with Purα during S or G2 phases were efficiently blocked with a 4N (G2 phase) DNA level, as determined by quantitative DNA photometry of individual cells. Of the cells injected with Purα during G1 phase, 40% experienced a rapid cell death characterized by extreme cellular fragmentation. Of those G1 injected cells which remained viable, approximately equal numbers were arrested with either 2N or 4N DNA levels. Cells arrested by Purα in G2 phase grew to cover a large surface area. These results link fluctuations in Purα levels to aspects of cell cycle control."
https://openalex.org/W2318218353,"The HTLV-1 Rex protein is an essential shuttle protein required for nuclear export of unspliced and incompletely-spliced viral RNAs. Several trans-dominant (TD) mutant Rex proteins have been reported, however, the mechanism of trans-dominance is not known. We compared TD Rex mutants and found that a natural occurring Rex mutant, Rexp21, lacking the RNA binding domain, was highly TD and inhibited also HIV-1 Rev function. Using fusions to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) we observed that Rexp21-GFP displayed a cytoplasmic localization but was actively shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in live human cells. The presence of Rexp21-GFP inhibited the nuclear export of Rex and HIV-1 Rev as assayed by cotransfection and microinjection experiments. However, Rex-GFP or Rexp21-GFP did not form heteromultimers with nuclear Rex mutants in vivo. In contrast, shuttling was essential for trans-dominance. Thus, we propose that TD Rex mutants do not function by retaining WT Rex in the nucleus by protein-protein interactions, as demonstrated for Rev, but to titrate factors essential for Rex/Rev export. Our findings demonstrate differences between the regulatory proteins Rex and Rev and implicate a novel strategy to generate highly TD Rex mutants also applicable to other proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2070381376,"The chimeric gene, AML1/ETO (MTG8), generated in t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia enhances the expression of Bcl-2. To evaluate whether this enhancement is the primary role of AML1/ETO in leukemogenesis, effects of over-expression of Bcl-2 in the murine myeloid precursor cell line, 32Dcl3, were examined. When 32Dcl3 cells expressing exogenous Bcl-2 were induced to differentiate, the onset of morphological differentiation was delayed. However, even the cells expressing very high levels of exogenous Bcl-2 eventually underwent differentiation without a significant decrease in the synthesis of Bcl-2. On the contrary, 32Dcl3 cells stably expressing AML1/ETO were completely resistant to differentiation and continued to grow in the presence of G-CSF. These results are consistent with the interpretation that stimulation of Bcl-2 expression is not the primary target of AML1/ETO."

https://openalex.org/W2314041451,"The Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a rare, dominantly inherited syndrome that features high risk of cancers in childhood and early adulthood. Affected families tend to develop bone and soft tissue sarcomas, breast cancers, brain tumors, leukemias, and adrenocortical carcinomas. In some kindreds, the genetic abnormality associated with this cancer phenotype is a heterozygous germline mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Recently, we identified one patient who presented in early childhood with multiple primary cancers and who harbored three germline p53 alterations (R156H and R267Q on the maternal allele and R290H on the paternal allele). To classify the biologic effects of these alterations, functional properties of each of the p53 mutants were examined using in vitro assays of cellular growth suppression and transcriptional activation. Each amino acid substitution conferred partial or complete loss of wild-type p53 function, but the child completed normal embryonic development. This observation has not been previously reported in a human, but is consistent with observations of normal embryogenesis in p53-deficient mice."

https://openalex.org/W2013696971,"Infection by some types of human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with the development of cervical cancer. Analysis of viral DNA from cervical tumours shows that the E2 gene is frequently disrupted during integration into the host cell's DNA. It has therefore been suggested that loss of E2p is an important step in malignant transformation. Expression of E2p in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe retards the G2-M transition, by delaying activation of Cdc2p kinase. In contrast, S phase progression, and commitment to cell division in late G1 are not affected. The delay is independent of the transcriptional trans-activation function of E2p, and does not result from E2p DNA binding mimicking DNA damage. Increased expression of E2p also delays mitotic initiation in mammalian cells. S. pombe may thus provide a simple model for the analysis of E2p function."
https://openalex.org/W2331354744,"Deregulated expression of c-Myc has been shown to induce or enhance apoptosis in various different cell types. c-Myc requires p53 for apoptosis in some but not all the cell types, indicating heterogeneous mechanisms for c-Myc-induced apoptosis. In B lymphoma line WEHI-231, stable expression of c-Myc has been demonstrated to protect cells from BCR-mediated apoptosis. However, stable expression of c-Myc carrying pro-apoptotic functions may generate variant cells resistant to apoptosis. By utilizing an inducible system for c-Myc, we demonstrated here that deregulated expression of c-Myc induced apoptosis of WEHI-231 by itself, indicating that c-Myc induces apoptosis in WEHI-231 as is the case for other cell types. When transactivation of p53 was inactivated, WEHI-231 cells overexpressing c-Myc no longer underwent apoptosis in the absence of other stimuli, but showed markedly enhanced apoptosis in the presence of BCR ligation. These results indicate that deregulated c-Myc expression enhances apoptosis by a p53-independent pathway in the presence of BCR signaling but requires p53 for apoptosis in the absence of BCR crosslinking in WEHI-231. BCR ligation may thus activate a p53-independent pathway of c-Myc-induced apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W2331608900,"Germ-line alterations of BRCA1 are associated with elevated risk of breast cancer. Evidence for the involvement of Brca1 in cellular differentiation and morphogenesis has been obtained in mouse models during embryogenesis. Although the presence of well-conserved functional domains might suggest a similar function for both human and mouse genes, very few data on BRCA1 expression in human fetal tissues are available. We have, therefore, investigated the expression of BRCA1 in the mammary gland from human female fetuses aged between 15 and 33 weeks. Quantification of BRCA1 transcripts, using a competitive reverse transcriptase PCR method, indicates a progressive decrease in BRCA1 expression with increasing fetal age between the 15th and 30th week of gestation. Subsequently, the amount of BRCA1 transcripts becomes similar to that found in adult mammary gland. Analysis of BRCA1 protein revealed, in fetal samples, a 220 kDa band corresponding to the 220 kDa BRCA1 protein described in human cell lines. These later experiments confirm that the relative level of the 220 kDa BRCA1 protein is highest in the early stages of mammary gland development. The temporal patterns of BRCA1 expression in human fetuses suggest a role for BRCA1 in the morphogenesis and differentiation of the human mammary gland."
https://openalex.org/W2329183188,"The failure of signal transduction in the JCaM1 cell line was associated with the presence of an abnormal lck mRNA deleted of the exon 7 encoding for an inactive p56lck kinase. Our study of the lck mRNA from various T cell lines and from peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy donors has revealed the presence of both complete and exon 7-deleted lck transcripts. Thus the exon 7-deleted lck transcript initially described in the JCaM1 mutant cell line, arises from an alternative splicing event occurring in each cells expressing the lck gene. Genomic DNA sequencing of the lck exons 6-8 portion from both the mutant JCaM1 and its parental Jurkat cell lines revealed as the only difference, the presence of a A to G mutation within the 5' splice site of intron 7 in the JCaM1 cell line DNA. To demonstrate the role of this point mutation in the lck pre-mRNA maturation, COS cells were transfected by lck minigenes from the Jurkat and JCaM1 cell lines. In COS cells transfected with minigene from the Jurkat cell line both lck transcripts (with and without exon 7) were observed whereas only the exon 7-spliced lck transcript was observed in COS cells transfected with minigene from the JCaM1 cell line. Thus the mutation is per se responsible for the deletion of exon 7 and the absence of complete lck mRNA in the JCaM1 cell line. Presence of a restriction site (HphI) in the 5' splice site of lck intron 7 from Jurkat DNA allowed to confirm the presence of the mutation on both alleles in the JCaM1 cell line."
https://openalex.org/W2093664670,"The retroviral Gag-like protein p58gag expressed in a highly metastatic ascites rat mammary adenocarcinoma has been implicated in cell surface changes contributing to xenotransplantability. p58gag is present in the cells in a plasma membrane- and microfilament-associated signal transduction particle containing Src and is phosphorylated on tyrosine. Overlay analyses and affinity chromatography with glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of Src homology-3 (SH3) domains showed direct binding of the Src but not the Crk SH3 domain to p58gag. This association was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of partially purified p58gag from ascites cell lysates with platelet Src. Further, a GST-p58gag fusion protein bound full length c-Src from either platelets or c-Src-expressing insect cells. The GST-p58gag fusion protein, but not GST, was phosphorylated by platelet or insect cell-expressed c-Src, but not by a kinase negative c-Src variant. The binding of GST-p58gag to c-Src was almost completely abolished by a 50-fold excess of the GST-SH3 domain of Src, and a parallel decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of p58gag was observed. These results demonstrate that p58gag is tyrosine-phosphorylated as a consequence of its specific association with c-Src via its SH3 domain. These observations suggest a mechanism by which Gag proteins may contribute to retroviral maturation or pathogenesis through binding and relocalization of SH3 domain-containing proteins such as Src-like tyrosine kinases to sites of association of microfilaments with the plasma membrane."
