https://openalex.org/W2054073262,"Abstract We have developed a simple and sensitive method for detecting, sizing and mapping RNA transcripts from viral or cloned DNAs. This technique has been used to examine the cytoplasmic transcripts produced during the early phase of adenovirus 2 (Ad2) infection of HeLa cells. Unlabeled total cytoplasmic or oligo (dT)-selected cytoplasmic RNA is hybridized to restriction fragments of 32 P-labeled viral DNA in 80% formamide under conditions above the Tm of the DNA duplex, but below the Tm of the RNA-DNA hybrid duplex (Casey and Davidson, 1977). DNA complements precisely the length of the hybridized RNA are generated by treating with single-strand-specific S1 endonuclease under conditions which do not introduce strand breaks into hybrid duplex. The sizes of the S1-resistant single-stranded DNAs are then determined by alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis (McDonnell, Simon and Studier, 1977). A restriction fragment which terminates within a region coding for an mRNA yields a band equal in size to the portion of the mRNA transcribed from that restriction fragment. This allows unique mapping of coding regions relative to restriction endonuclease cleavage sites. All early Ad2 transcripts are clustered in four regions of the viral DNA. At least five early stable cytoplasmic colinear transcripts are transcribed to the right from the left end of the viral genome, the region of the genome coding functions necessary for transformation of mammalian cells. Transcripts of 650, 350 and 1750 nucleotides map from 1.7 ± 0.5 to 3.6 ± 0.5, 3.6 ± 0.2 to 4.6 ± 0.4, and 4.7 ± 0.3 to 9.5 ± 0.5 units, respectively, and there are two 450 nucleotide transcripts tentatively mapped in the region of 3.0 and 11.0 units. Two overlapping transcripts of 1600 and 1700 nucleotides having the same 3′ terminus and 5′ termini displaced by 100 nucleotides are transcribed to the left from 66.2 ± 0.3 to 61.6 ± 0.2 and 66.5 ± 0.3 to 61.6 ± 0.2 units, respectively. Seven other distinct early stable cytoplasmic transcripts have also been positioned on the genome."

The receptor is mainly localized in the synaptic membrane fraction. Binding to the receptor is stereospecific. Competition for the receptor by various benzodiazepines closely parallels their pharmacological potency."
https://openalex.org/W2059991470,"Abstract We have previously shown that histone-depleted metaphase chromosomes can be isolated by treating purified HeLa chromosomes with dextran sulfate and heparin (Adolph, Cheng and Laemmli, 1977a). The chromosomes form fast-sedimenting complexes which are held together by a few nonhistone proteins. In this paper, we have studied the histone-depleted chromosomes in the electron microscope. Our results show that: the histone-depleted chromosomes consist of a scaffold or core, which has the shape characteristic of a metaphase chromosome, surrounded by a halo of DNA; the halo consists of many loops of DNA, each anchored in the scaffold at its base; most of the DNA exists in loops at least 10–30 μm long (30–90 kilobases). We also show that the same results can be obtained when the histones are removed from the chromosomes with 2 M NaCl instead of dextran sulfate. Moreover, the histone-depleted chromosomes are extraordinarily stable in 2 M NaCI, providing further evidence that they are held together by nonhistone proteins. These results suggest a scaffolding model for metaphase chromosome structure in which a backbone of nonhistone proteins is responsible for the basic shape of metaphase chromosomes, and the scaffold organizes the DNA into loops along its length."
https://openalex.org/W1800061482,"Two populations of mitochondria were observed upon ultrastructural examination of cardiac muscle tissue, one located directly beneath the sarcolemma (subsarcolemmal mitochondria) and another between the myofibrils (interfibrillar mitochondria). Subsarcolemmal mitochondria were released by treatment of heart muscle with a Polytron tissue processor, while interfibrillar mitochondria were released by nagarse digestion of the remaining tissue. These results were supported by electron microscopy of Polytron-treated heart tissue showing rupture and loss of sarcolemma with release of the underlying mitochondria but with retention of intact mitochondria between the myofibrils. Electron microscopy of the isolated mitochondria indicated that both mitochondrial types maintained their structural integrity throughout the isolation procedure. Specific activities of succinate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase were higher in the interfibrillar mitochondria as compared to the subsarcolemmal mitochondria, while those of carnitine palmitoyltransferase and alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase were nearly the same in both. Interfibrillar mitochondria oxidized all substrates tested approximately 1.5 times faster than did the subsarcolemmal mitochondria. Thus the two mitochondrial types differed not only in their respective locations in the cell, but also in certain biochemical properties."

A dramatic increase in face fixations occurred between 5 and 7 weeks for all conditions. Talking produced an intensification of scanning in the eye area in the two older groups."
https://openalex.org/W2085931205,"A kinetic approach has been used to study the selective uptake of a lysosomal enzyme by fibroblasts cultured from human skin. α-l-Iduronidase is obtained from human urine in two forms, one of which is taken up a hundred times faster than the other. Internalization of the “high uptake” form obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the rate being half-maximal when the concentration of the enzyme in the medium is 3 × 10−9 M. A small number of substances inhibit this uptake: mannose, l-fucose and sialic acid (Ki ∼ 0.1 M); pnitrophenyl glycosides of mannose and l-fucose (Ki ∼ 0.01 M); mannose 6-phosphate (Ki = 4 × 10−5 M), fructose 1-phosphate (Ki = 8 × 10−5 M); and a glycoprotein fraction purified from human urine (Ki ≦ 10−8 M). The inhibition by mannose 6-phosphate and by the urinary inhibitor has been shown to be competitive by rigorous kinetic analysis. The inhibitory potency of the urinary glycoprotein fraction is decreased by treatment with NalO4 or with alkaline phosphatase, although not by incubation with a number of glycosidases and sulfatases. Phosphatase treatment of α-l-iduronidase itself abolishes uptake. These results are compatible with recognition of the high uptake form of α-l-iduronidase through phosphorylated carbohydrate residues on the enzyme and binding to saturable receptors on the cell surface. Preliminary experiments suggest that even the “low uptake” form of the enzyme may be taken up by receptor binding, although with much lower affinity."
https://openalex.org/W2039686608,"Washing the nipples of anesthetized parturient rats virtually eliminated nipple attachment by their young. Normal attachment was induced only by painting the washed nipples with a distillate of the nipple wash, parturient-mother saliva, or her amniotic fluids. Reinstatement was not achieved by coating the washed nipples with the saliva of virgin females eating the same diet, the parturient mother's urine, isotonic saline, amyl acetate, or vanilla extract. These experiments also provide behavioral evidence for olfactory function in the newborn albino rat."
https://openalex.org/W1968806977,"In this paper, we show that HeLa metaphase chromosomes still possess a highly organized structure retaining the familiar metaphase morphology following removal of virtually all the histones and most of the nonhistone proteins. The structure is stabilized by a relatively small number of nonhistones, which we call scaffolding proteins. These results are based on a method which allows the removal of the histones, and most of the nonhistone proteins, by competition with polyanions such as dextran sulfate and heparin. The histone-depleted chromosomes sediment in sucrose gradients as a broad peak between 4000 to 7000S. These structures are dissociated by mild trypsin or chymotrypsin treatment, or by 4 M urea, but are stable in 2 M NaCl and insensitive to treatment with RNAase A. The histone-depleted chromosomes have a DNA to protein ratio of about 6:1; gel electrophoresis reveals the presence of about 30 nonhistone proteins and the virtual absence of histones. These experiments suggest that nonhistone proteins exist in metaphase chromosomes which maintain the DNA chain in a highly folded conformation. Structural studies support this conclusion. Analysis by fluorescence microscopy of histone-depleted chromosomes stained with ethidium bromide shows that each chromatid is still paired with its sister chromatid, and consists of a central structure surrounded by a halo of DNA. The length of the central structure in each chromatid is about 2–3 times longer than the chromatid length in the original chromosome."

https://openalex.org/W2104986560,"Six restriction fragments of Ad2 DNA which contain sites for RNA initiation have been identified by their ability to hybridize nascent labeled RNA less than 1 kb in length. Four RNA initiation sites early in infection are identified in regions where previous work (Flint, 1977) had mapped mRNAs. The major late RNA initiation site is the origin of a giant nuclear transcript extending from approximately 16.3 map units to (or close to) 100 units at the end of the genome. This transcription unit encompasses at least four or five mRNA sites; processing of this long transcript appears necessary to generate the mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1550077015,"A clonal rat sympathetic nerve cell line, PC12, binds iodinated alpha-bungarotoxin. The binding is saturable and is inhibited by a variety of cholinergic agonists and antagonists. The pseudo-first order rate constant for binding is 2.1 x 10(5) M-1 S-1 at 22 degrees. In contrast to the alpha-bungarotoxin binding reaction found with muscle, the binding to PC12 is reversible with a first order rate constant of 4.9 x 10(-5) S-1 at 37 degrees. Toxin binds to an integral membrane component which sediments in sucrose gradients containing Triton X-100 with an apparent sedimentation coefficient of 10.5 S. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor of PC12 was assayed by determining the agonist-induced increase in permeability to sodium ions. Using this assay, we determined the apparent binding constants for a variety of cholinergic ligands and found no correlation between their ability to affect cholinergic function and to inhibit binding of alpha-bungarotoxin. Therefore, the site at which cholinergic ligands affect receptor function is different than the site at which cholinergic ligands inhibit toxin binding."

https://openalex.org/W2054958453,"Two-day-old rats were exposed to a novel odor and injected with an illness-inducing drug, lithium chloride. When tested at 8 days of age, these pups avoided pine shavings scented with the odor, whereas control pups did not. These results imply that rat pups are capable of associative learning at a much earlier age than was thought possible."
https://openalex.org/W2058238471,"The mRNAs for α-, β- and γ-actin have been characterized with respect to molecular weight and poly(A) content. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions shows that the mRNA for α-actin (muscle-specific actin) is approximately 4.6 × 105 daltons in size, and that the mRNAs for β- and γ-actin (nonmuscle actins) are much larger, approximately 6.6 × 105 daltons in size. We therefore calculate that the noncoding regions of the β- and γ-actin mRNAs contain about 800 nucleotides. This is in marked contrast to the noncoding regions of α-actin mRNA which contain only about 180 nucleotides. During electrophoresis in high-resolution nondenaturing gels, the β-actin mRNA migrates slightly slower than the γ-actin mRNA. This indicates either that β-actin mRNA is about 100 nucleotides longer than γ-actin mRNA, or that these mRNAs differ in secondary structure. Fractionation of actin mRNA on the basis of poly(A) content shows that a substantial portion of the β-actin mRNA, but very little of the α- or γ-actin mRNAs, fails to bind to oligo(dT)-cellulose. Much of this poly(A)-deficient β-actin mRNA, however, does bind to poly(U)-Sepharose, a substrate with higher affinity for short poly(A) sequences. This indicates that many of these β-actin mRNA molecules are polyadenylated, but that they have unusually short poly(A) tails. The finding that β- and γ-actins are translated from mRNAs of different electrophoretic mobility and different poly(A) content strongly suggests that these two closely related proteins are products of different genes."

Geniculate cells increase in size rapidly during the first 6 to 12 months of postnatal life, with cells in the parvocellular layers developing faster than cells in the magnocellular layers. At least 2 years are required before all cells have reached their adult size."
https://openalex.org/W1558094901,"The synthesis and degradation of the renal glomerular basement membrane have been investigated in the rat with the aid of injected tracer doses of various tritiated amino acids including L-proline, L-lysine, L-phenylalanine, L-leucine, and glycine. After incorporation into the basement membrane the turnover times of these amino acid constituents, as well as of hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine, were determined from the decay in their specific radioactivities. The loss of radioactivity from the proline and hydroxyproline of the glomerular basement membrane was as slow as that from tail tendon collagen in the same animals (turnover time of more than 100 days) and contrasted with the radiodecay of the proline in other glomerular proteins (turnover time of 9 days). The glycine of the membrane similarly turned over at this very slow rate. The total replacement times of the leucine, hydroxylysine, lysine, and phenylalanine constituents of the basement membrane were determined to be somewhat shorter with a range of 65 to 23 days. The nonuniform turnover of these membrane components may be a function of the polydispersity of the peptide subunits of the basement membrane observed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and may reflect a subtle morphological and functional heterogeneity. The amino acid and saccharide composition of the rat glomerular basement membrane used in these studies are also reported."

https://openalex.org/W1499254173,"Normal and sickle erythrocytes were exposed in vitro to millimolar concentrations of 31 different carbonyl compounds. Schiff base (imine) linkages were formed with amino groups of intracellular hemoglobin. Adducts were isolated by gel electrofocusing and could be dissociated by dialysis. Aromatic aldehydes proved more reactive than aliphatic aldehydes, and ketones were unreactive. The influence of various ring substituents on the reactivity of aromatic aldehydes was found to conform closely to traditional concepts regarding electronic and steric effects. Several of the aromatic aldehydes were shown to markedly increase the oxygen affinity of hemoglobins A and S. In particular, 2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde and o-vanillin, at concentrations of 5 mM, produced 2- to 3-fold reductions in the P50 (partial pressure of oxygen at half-saturation) of sickle hemoglobin in whole blood. Since low degrees of oxygen saturation promote erythrocyte sickling, compounds of this type significantly inhibit sickling at reduced partial pressures of oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W2010988173,"Bubbles in the sea surf adsorb and carry viruses to the surface where they are propelled into the air on tiny jets of seawater when the bubble bursts. The ejected jets become tiny drops of aerosol. The buble adsorption and virus concentration in the surf is analagous to industrial bubble levitation processes that concentrate metallic ores, enzymes, and finely divided organic crystals. Bubble levitation of viruses delibrately injected into the surf produced 200 times more virus per milliliter in the aerosol than were present in samples from the surf. Some aerosol drops created by the surf and carried by the wind fall out on the beach. The frequency of virus-bearing drops, that is, the number of plaques on seeded plates exposed on the beach, decreased exponentially with the distance downwind from the surf."

https://openalex.org/W1502429573,"Acetylcholine receptor from denervated rat leg muscle was purified 48,000-fold by affinity chromatography on concanavalin A/Sepharose and cobrotoxin/Sepharose. A control preparation containing only contaminants was made by performing a parallel purification in which alpha-bungarotoxin was added to the preparation prior to the cobrotoxin/Sepharose step. Comparison of the receptor was greater than 90% pure. Examination of the purified receptor by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate revealed two major polypeptide chains with apparent weights of 45,000 and 51,000, along with minor components of 49,000, 56,000, 62,000, and 110,000. Polypeptides of the same molecular weight were found when purified acetylcholine receptor was radioiodinated and further purified by sucrose gradient sedimentation. Analysis of receptor purified from denervated muscles that had been incubated with [35S]methionine in organ culture showed that all of the identified polypeptide chains were radioactive, indicating that they had been synthesized de novo after denervation."
https://openalex.org/W2030121364,"A small RNA species, distinct from the VA RNAs, has been identified in HeLa cells infected with adenovirus type 2. The RNA, which has been purified using a novel screening procedure, is polyadenylated, sediments at 9S and has an estimated length of 550 nucleotides. In a cell-free translation system, the 9S RNA directs the synthesis of virion polypeptide IX, molecular weight 12,000 daltons. The location of its gene has been established by hybridization of the RNA to fragments of viral DNA produced by cleavage with restriction endonucleases: it spans position 10.0 on the r strand of the viral genome. These results unexpectedly place the gene for a ""late"" protein within a region of the genome which is transcribed early during infection"

A variety of techniques were employed to determine whether the NGF dimer dissociates at the low concentrations at which it is biologically active. No dissociation was detected in 48 h at low NGF concentrations using the techniques and minimum concentrations which follow: sedimentation equilibrium of NGF at 200 nM and of 125I-NGF at 2.5 nM; gel filtration chromatography of NGF at 5 nM, of 125I-NGF at 5 pM, and of 125I-NGF from which COOH-terminal arginyl residues, or NH2-terminal octapeptide had been cleaved, at 10 pM; and sucrose gradient centrifugation of 125I-NGF at 10 pM. Dissociation of heavily succinylated 125I-NGF was detected by gel filtration chromatography, and the equilibrium dissociation constant for this material is estimated to be 10 pM."
https://openalex.org/W1490337128,"Rat adipocyte plasma membranes have previously been shown to retain stereospecific transport activity for D-glucose following extraction of extrinsic proteins with dimethylmaleic anhydride (Shanahan, M. F., and Czech, M. P. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 6554-6561). When these extracted plasma membranes were incubated in 2% sodium cholate and centrifuged, the resultant supernatant contained only one major glycoprotein fraction of 94,000 daltons, as determined by dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This protein fraction was combined with cholate-dispersed, exogenous phospholipids. The detergent was removed by gel filtration and vesicles composed of phospholipid and membrane protein were formed which exhibited preferential, time-dependent uptake of D- versus L-glucose when measured by a rapid filtration method. In addition, D-glucose uptake was inhibited by cytochalasin B, phlorizin, phloretin, and dipyridamole. These results suggest the direct involvement of the 94,000-dalton glycoprotein fraction in fat cell hexose transport."
https://openalex.org/W1580289779,"A translational assay was used to measure the level of mRNA coding for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (EC 4.1.1.32) in the rat kidney in various conditions in which the enzyme is induced. RNA extracted from whole kidneys was chromatographed on oligo(dT)-cellulose to select poly(A)-containing RNA. This crude mRNA preparation was able to stimulate amino acid incorporation into protein in a cell-free system containing an extract of wheat germ. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase could be detected among the polypeptides synthesized and quantitated by immunoprecipitation with a monospecific antibody followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The amount of enzyme synthesized was proportional to the quantity of RNA added. The level of mRNA coding for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase is increased 3-fold 6 h after triamcinolone injection. Translatable enzyme mRNA also increases 3-fold within 6 h of the onset of metabolic acidosis caused by an ammonium chloride load. In both cases, the increase in functional mRNA is commensurate with the stimulation of enzyme synthesis measured in vivo. Glucocorticoid administration and acidosis cause additive increases in the level of translatable phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA. The inductive effect of acidosis is preserved in the absence of the adrenals, hypophysis, thyroid, and parathyroids."
https://openalex.org/W2092968033,"Mice genetically transmitting the exogenous Moloney leukemia virus (M-MuLV) have been previously derived. These animals carried one copy of M-MuLV DNA in their germ line and were heterozygous for the M-MuLV locus (Jaenisch, 1976). Experiments were performed to investigate whether homozygosity at the M-MuLV locus would be compatible with normal development. Animals heterozygous for the M-MuLV locus were mated [female (+/-) X male(+/-)] and the genotype of the offspring was analyzed. Molecular hybridization experiments revealed three classes of offspring carrying two copies (++), one copy (+/-) and no (--) M-MuLV-specific DNA sequences, respectively, in their liver DNA. Genetic experiments indicated that males of the first class transmitted the virus to 100% of their offspring, males of the second class to 50% and males of the third class not at all when mated with normal females. These results demonstrated that homozygosity at the M-MuLV locus has no detectable effect on normal development of the animals and that the M-MuLV gene is transmitted from one generation to the next strictly according to Mendelian expectations. Development of M-MuLV-induced leukemia is not influenced by the genotype of these animals--that is, animals carrying two or one copies of M-MuLV in their germ line or animals congenitally infected from the mother developed disease at similar rates."
https://openalex.org/W2005167210,"In the marine mollusk Pleurobranchaea, it is known that feeding occurs and withdrawal from tactile stimuli is suppressed when the sensory stimuli for feeding and withdrawal are presented simultaneously. This ""dominance"" of feeding behavior over withdrawal behavior occurs because the central nervous network controlling feeding inhibits the central nervous network controlling withdrawal. The inhibition is mediated by a bilaterally symmetrical pair of reidentifiable feeding neurons that are members of the ""corollary discharge"" population in the buccal ganglion. This study supports the hypothesis that inhibitory interactions between competing motor systems are responsible for the ""singleness of action"" that characterizes animal behavior."

The hybrids formed between near-diploid parental cells resembled Friend cells in the ability to grow in suspension and to synthesize hemoglobin in the presence of the chemical inducers dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ouabain. Erythropoietin (EPO) was effective in inducing hemoglobin synthesis in some of the hybrid cell lines. The hemoglobins synthesized by the hybrids were of the adult forms, but were quantitatively different from those hemoglobins synthesized by the parental Friend cells, suggesting that the fusion event modulated the expression of the hemoglobin chain genes."
https://openalex.org/W1532674484,"A ketone monooxygenase was purified from cells of Pseudomonas cepacia grown on 2-tridecanone as sole carbon source. Enzyme stability is maintained by the addition of ethanol, EDTA, and dithiothreitol. Stoichiometric studies show that for 1 mol of undecyl acetate formed, 1 mol of O2 is consumed and 1 mol of NADPH is oxidized. The monooxygenase, purified to homogeneity, has a molecular weight of approximately 123,000 and consists of two equal subunits with molecular weights of 55,000. The enzyme contains FAD and exhibits absorption maxima at 375 and 488 nm. Enzyme activity is inhibited by thiol-active reagents and the inhibition by the cations, cadmium, copper, zinc, and mercury, is reversed by dithiothreitol, indicating the presence of essential sulfhydryl groups. Substrate specificity tests show that acetate esters are formed from methyl ketones from C-7 through C-14. The oxygenase is also active on isomers of 2-tridecanone forming esters from 3- through 7-tridecanone. With 6-tridecanone, two esters are formed, heptyl hexanoate and pentyl octanoate, indicating that oxygen is inserted on either side of the carbonyl group. In addition, the enzyme catalyzes the lactonization of the cyclic ketone, cyclopentanone, with the formation of 5-valerolactone."

The serum survival time of native interferon was drastically reduced by prior enzymatic cleavage of the terminal sialic acid residues to yield the galactose-terminal product, asialo-interferon. This phenomenon was completely reversed by further extensive digestion with a mixture of glycosidases which effectively removed over 85% of the total carbohydrate residues. These results suggest that the intact carbohydrate structure is neither essential for normal circulation time in vivo nor for biologic activity in vitro."

When both ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate and xylulose 1,5-bisphosphate were added simultaneously to the enzyme, this inhibition appeared to be competitive. A preincubation of 20 to 30 min was needed for maximum inhibition.

https://openalex.org/W1490024203,"When beta-fluoropropionyl coenzyme A is used as substrate, propionyl-CoA carboxylase catalyzes the formation of ADP and the elimination of fluoride ion. No F- release occurs in the absence of ATP or in the presence of avidin. ADP formation occurs as rapidly as in the presence of propionyl-CoA, but the rate of F- release is 6 times that of ADP formation. The rate of F- release is indicative of the minimal rate of abstraction of the alpha proton, and the rate of ADP formation is equivalent to the rate of formation of biotin-CO2. The results, therefore, show that hydrogen abstraction can occur without concomitant CO2 transfer from biotin-CO2 to the substrate. Therefore, the concerted mechanism which has been proposed for this, and other biotin enzymes, is not applicable when propionyl-CoA carboxylase acts on beta-fluoropropionyl-CoA. We believe the concerted mechanism is also not involved in the carboxylation of the normal substrate, propionyl-CoA."

https://openalex.org/W1990011156,"In vivo, glucose preferentially stimulates proinsulin biosynthesis; at least part of this process is independent of new RNA synthesis and is accompanied by increases in the overall rate of polypeptide chain initiation. The cell-free translation of proinsulin messenger RNA is very sensitive to changes in the protein-synthesizing system. Proinsulin synthesis is preferentially inhibited by the addition of increasing quantities of polyadenylate-containing RNA from the fetal bovine pancreas or by the addition of the drug, aurintricarboxylic acid, which blocks polypeptide chain initiation. These results suggest that proinsulin messenger RNA competes less efficiently for rate controlling initiation factors. We propose that glucose stimulates proinsulin biosynthesis by allowing the less competitive proinsulin messenger RNA to be translated more efficiently."

The metabolic pools between protoporphyrin and protochlorophyllide were monitored spectrofluorometrically. The incorporation of the 14C label into protochlorophyllide was also determined. It was shown that protoporphyrin IX, a postulated intermediate of the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway, was convertible into protochlorophyllide. Since protochlorophyllide is the immediate precursor of chlorophyll a it was concluded that protoporphyrin IX was indeed an intermediate of the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway."

We conclude that denervated fibers do not induce substantial physiological changes in adjacent innervated muscle fibers.

The active protein was isolated by affinity chromatography on soybean trypsin inhibitor-Sepharose. It appears to be an anhydroenzyme or a mixture of a limited number of anhydroenzymes in which a serine other than the catalytically essential serine-195 of the native enzyme has been converted to dehydroalanine.

The oligoribonucleotides are effective primers for the DNA polymerase of bacteriophage T7 on the single-stranded circular DNAs of phage fd and phiX174; they are covalently attached to the 5' terminus of the newly synthesized DNA. The priming activity is specific; the oligoribonucleotides do not serve as primers for DNA polymerase I of Escherichia coli or for the DNA polymerase induced by phage T4.
