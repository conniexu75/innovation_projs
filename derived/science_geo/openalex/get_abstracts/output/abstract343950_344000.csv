https://openalex.org/W2022623438,The diffraction patterns of both silica and germania glasses are consistent with a structure in which nearly all of the atoms belong to tridymite-like regions of up to about 20 angstroms or more that are bonded efficiently together in a manner analogous to that found in twinned crystals.

https://openalex.org/W1974889902,"Two-dimensional signal averaging has been applied to dark field electron micrographs of molecules of 2,3,4,5-tetraacetoxymercurithiophene. Only the mercury atom images are seen in single micrographs. However, in the composite image, resulting from photographic superposition of 64 individual images, the sulfur atom in the molecule is clearly revealed."

https://openalex.org/W2093792903,Seeds in a conifer cone from the Lower Permian of west Texas contain embryo tissue. These are the oldest plant embryos on record. Their development prior to seed dispersal shows that the sequence of embryo growth typical of most modern seed plants had evolved before the end of the Paleozoic Era.

https://openalex.org/W2019965330,"A new method for identification of normal modes of oscillation of the earth yielded unambiguous determinations of many overtones never before identified. This method consists of the superposition of spectra observed at many stations over the earth, after a correction for the phase determined from the known earthquake source mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2065090756,"The major feature of isospin in nuclei that I have discussed here is its application to all nuclei. The rebirth of this quantum number in nuclear physics occurred in the early 1960's and was initiated almost entirely by the important work of Anderson et al. and Fox et al.. There is still great interest in the use of isospin in its fullest sense as predicted by Wigner, and indeed isospin concepts have been largely responsible for demonstrating that nuclei in the doubly ""magic number"" region of 208Pb are remarkably in agreement with shell model theory."
