https://openalex.org/W2152132532,"Birds of a feather proverbially flock together, but just how large groups of animals move in a coordinated way has defied complete explanation. Do they follow a leader, or does pattern emerge from a set of simple behavioural rules? Until now the question has been addressed largely with numerical modelling, but with the availability of miniature 'backpack-style' GPS loggers weighing just 16 grams, it is now possible to track each bird in a flock and test the models against direct measurement. Experiments using flocks of up to 10 homing pigeons reveal that a bird's position in the flight depends on its place in a well-defined social hierarchy — an airborne 'pecking order'. Intriguingly, birds respond more quickly to a flock-mate seen primarily with the left eye, adding to evidence that they have specific roles dependent on their position in the flock. How large groups of animals move in a coordinated way has defied complete explanation. Inability to track each member of a flock has hampered understanding of the behavioural rules governing flocks of birds. This, however, has been achieved for a small group of homing pigeons fitted with lightweight GPS loggers. A well–defined hierarchy is revealed — the average position of a pigeon within the flock strongly correlates with is position in the social hierarchy (a kind of airborne pecking order). Animals that travel together in groups display a variety of fascinating motion patterns thought to be the result of delicate local interactions among group members1,2,3. Although the most informative way of investigating and interpreting collective movement phenomena would be afforded by the collection of high-resolution spatiotemporal data from moving individuals, such data are scarce4,5,6,7 and are virtually non-existent for long-distance group motion within a natural setting because of the associated technological difficulties8. Here we present results of experiments in which track logs of homing pigeons flying in flocks of up to 10 individuals have been obtained by high-resolution lightweight GPS devices and analysed using a variety of correlation functions inspired by approaches common in statistical physics. We find a well-defined hierarchy among flock members from data concerning leading roles in pairwise interactions, defined on the basis of characteristic delay times between birds’ directional choices. The average spatial position of a pigeon within the flock strongly correlates with its place in the hierarchy, and birds respond more quickly to conspecifics perceived primarily through the left eye—both results revealing differential roles for birds that assume different positions with respect to flock-mates. From an evolutionary perspective, our results suggest that hierarchical organization of group flight may be more efficient than an egalitarian one, at least for those flock sizes that permit regular pairwise interactions among group members, during which leader–follower relationships are consistently manifested."

A notable exception to this behaviour is the case of quantum spin liquids, in which quantum fluctuations prevent a transition to an ordered state down to the lowest temperatures. There have now been tentative observations of such states in some two-dimensional organic compounds, yet quantum spin liquids remain elusive in microscopic two-dimensional models that are relevant to experiments. Here we show, by means of large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations of correlated fermions on a honeycomb lattice (a structure realized in, for example, graphene), that a quantum spin liquid emerges between the state described by massless Dirac fermions and an antiferromagnetically ordered Mott insulator. This unexpected quantum-disordered state is found to be a short-range resonating valence-bond liquid, akin to the one proposed for high-temperature superconductors: the possibility of unconventional superconductivity through doping therefore arises in our system. We foresee the experimental realization of this model system using ultra-cold atoms, or group IV elements arranged in honeycomb lattices."

https://openalex.org/W2095038001,"Understanding the molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance remains a major medical challenge of the twenty-first century. Over the last half-century, many hypotheses have been proposed to explain insulin resistance, and, most recently, inflammation associated with alterations in adipocytokines has become the prevailing hypothesis. Here we discuss diacylglycerol-mediated insulin resistance as an alternative and unifying hypothesis to explain the most common forms of insulin resistance associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as lipodystrophy and aging."
https://openalex.org/W2079569342,"The autophagic/lysosomal system includes a variety of vesicular compartments that undergo dynamic fusion events. However, the characteristics and factors modulating these interactions remain, for the most part, unknown. To gain insights on the properties that govern lysosomal fusion events, we have established an in vitro fusion assay using different lysosomal/autophagic compartments isolated from mouse liver. We have found that autophagosome/lysosome fusion is a temperature-dependent process (fusion increment of 0.2+/-0.01%/degrees C), which requires ATP (1-3 mM), GTP (1-2 mM), Ca(2+) (0.2-2 mM), and an acidic lysosomal pH (pH 5.2). Furthermore, changes in membrane lipid composition, induced either in vitro, by treatment with 25 mM methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, or in vivo, by subjecting animals to a high-fat-diet challenge (60% kcal in fat) reduce autophagosome/lysosome fusion up to 70% of that observed in untreated fractions or from animals under a normal regular diet. These findings reveal a novel role for lipids in autophagic fusion and provide a mechanism for the reduced macroautophagic rates observed during exposure to a chronic lipid challenge. Changes in the intracellular lipid content (i.e., metabolic disorders) may thus have pronounced effects on the fusion step of macroautophagy and affect the overall activity of this intracellular proteolytic pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2020405262,"X-ray diffraction plays a pivotal role in the understanding of biological systems by revealing atomic structures of proteins, nucleic acids and their complexes, with much recent interest in very large assemblies like the ribosome. As crystals of such large assemblies often diffract weakly (resolution worse than 4 Å), we need methods that work at such low resolution. In macromolecular assemblies, some of the components may be known at high resolution, whereas others are unknown: current refinement methods fail as they require a high-resolution starting structure for the entire complex1. Determining the structure of such complexes, which are often of key biological importance, should be possible in principle as the number of independent diffraction intensities at a resolution better than 5 Å generally exceeds the number of degrees of freedom. Here we introduce a method that adds specific information from known homologous structures but allows global and local deformations of these homology models. Our approach uses the observation that local protein structure tends to be conserved as sequence and function evolve. Cross-validation with Rfree (the free R-factor) determines the optimum deformation and influence of the homology model. For test cases at 3.5–5 Å resolution with known structures at high resolution, our method gives significant improvements over conventional refinement in the model as monitored by coordinate accuracy, the definition of secondary structure and the quality of electron density maps. For re-refinements of a representative set of 19 low-resolution crystal structures from the Protein Data Bank, we find similar improvements. Thus, a structure derived from low-resolution diffraction data can have quality similar to a high-resolution structure. Our method is applicable to the study of weakly diffracting crystals using X-ray micro-diffraction2 as well as data from new X-ray light sources3. Use of homology information is not restricted to X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy: as optical imaging advances to subnanometre resolution4,5, it can use similar tools."
https://openalex.org/W1969587274,"Atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular diseases represent one of the greatest threats to human health worldwide. Despite important progress in prevention and treatment, these conditions still account for one third of all deaths annually. Often presented together with obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, these chronic diseases are strongly influenced by pathways that lie at the interface of chronic inflammation and nutrient metabolism. Here I discuss recent advances in the study of endoplasmic reticulum stress as one mechanism that links immune response with nutrient sensing in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and its complications."

https://openalex.org/W2057851741,"Every 27.1 years the bright binary star ε Aurigae dims as it undergoes an eclipse lasting about 18 months. Until now the body that transits the disk of the ε Aur system has been undetectable and the subject of much speculation. The preferred explanation is that the invisible companion is a tilted disk of opaque material surrounding a hidden star. Recent work implies that the system consists of a visible F-star, paired with a single B5V star enshrouded by a disk at a temperature of about 500K. Now interferometric observations made with the six-telescope CHARA Array in November and December 2009 have produced images of the eclipsing body in the infrared, revealing it to be an opaque disk, its elliptical shape suggesting that it is tilting as predicted. ε Aurigae is a bright, eclipsing binary star system but the cause of each 18-month-long eclipse has been unknown for nearly 190 years, because the companion was, until recently, undetectable. The preferred explanation has been a tilted disk of opaque material and here the authors report interferometric images that do indeed show an opaque disk of very low mass, tilted as expected, crossing the disk of the F star. Epsilon Aurigae (ε Aur) is a visually bright, eclipsing binary star system with a period of 27.1 years. The cause of each 18-month-long eclipse has been a subject of controversy for nearly 190 years1 because the companion has hitherto been undetectable. The orbital elements imply that the opaque object has roughly the same mass as the visible component, which for much of the last century was thought to be an F-type supergiant star with a mass of ∼15M⊙ (M⊙, mass of the Sun). The high mass-to-luminosity ratio of the hidden object was originally explained by supposing it to be a hyperextended infrared star2 or, later, a black hole3 with an accretion disk, although the preferred interpretation was as a disk of opaque material4,5 at a temperature of ∼500 K, tilted to the line of sight6,7 and with a central opening8. Recent work implies that the system consists of a low-mass (2.2M⊙–3.3M⊙) visible F-type star, with a disk at 550 K that enshrouds a single B5V-type star9. Here we report interferometric images that show the eclipsing body moving in front of the F star. The body is an opaque disk and appears tilted as predicted7. Adopting a mass of 5.9M⊙ for the B star, we derive a mass of ∼(3.6 ± 0.7)M⊙ for the F star. The disk mass is dynamically negligible; we estimate it to contain ∼0.07M⊕ (M⊕, mass of the Earth) if it consists purely of dust."
https://openalex.org/W2082329327,"The dengue virus (DENV) NS3 protein is essential for viral polyprotein processing and RNA replication. It contains an N-terminal serine protease region (residues 1–168) joined to an RNA helicase (residues 180–618) by an 11-amino acid linker (169–179). The structure at 3.15 Å of the soluble NS3 protein from DENV4 covalently attached to 18 residues of the NS2B cofactor region (NS2B18NS3) revealed an elongated molecule with the protease domain abutting subdomains I and II of the helicase (Luo, D., Xu, T., Hunke, C., Grüber, G., Vasudevan, S. G., and Lescar, J. (2008) J. Virol. 82, 173–183). Unexpectedly, using similar crystal growth conditions, we observed an alternative conformation where the protease domain has rotated by ∼161° with respect to the helicase domain. We report this new crystal structure bound to ADP-Mn2+ refined to a resolution of 2.2 Å. The biological significance for interdomain flexibility conferred by the linker region was probed by either inserting a Gly residue between Glu173 and Pro174 or replacing Pro174 with a Gly residue. Both mutations resulted in significantly lower ATPase and helicase activities. We next increased flexibility in the linker by introducing a Pro176 to Gly mutation in a DENV2 replicon system. A 70% reduction in luciferase reporter signal and a similar reduction in the level of viral RNA synthesis were observed. Our results indicate that the linker region has evolved to an optimum length to confer flexibility to the NS3 protein that is required both for polyprotein processing and RNA replication.

Dengue virus (DENV) 4The abbreviations used are: DENVDengue virusDENV4dengue virus serotype 4NS3nonstructural protein 3WTwild typePDBProtein Data BankMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. is an important vector-borne virus that causes a spectrum of illnesses in humans ranging from asymptomatic to severe disease, including dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. More than half of the ∼70 members of the flavivirus genus that includes the four serotypes of DENV (DENV1–4), yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and West Nile virus, are important human pathogens (1Lindenbach B.D. Thiel H.J. Rice C.M. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 5th Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia2007: 1101-1152Google Scholar). The positive-sense flavivirus RNA genome of ∼11 kb contains a single open reading frame that is translated into a polyprotein precursor, consisting of the structural proteins C, prM, and E and seven nonstructural proteins NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5. During viral replication, the polyprotein is cleaved by host proteases in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen and viral proteases at the cytoplasmic face (1Lindenbach B.D. Thiel H.J. Rice C.M. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 5th Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia2007: 1101-1152Google Scholar). The NS3 protein (618 amino acids in DENV4) contains a serine-protease domain at its N terminus (whose activity requires the formation of a noncovalent complex with the central 40-residue hydrophilic segment of the membrane-bound NS2B protein cofactor) and an ATP-driven helicase and RNA triphosphatase at its C-terminal end.

We also reported crystal structures for NS3hel from DENV4 in complex with single strand RNA and a complete set of ligands detailing the RNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis pathway (14Luo D. Xu T. Watson R.P. Scherer-Becker D. Sampath A. Jahnke W. Yeong S.S. Wang C.H. Lim S.P. Strongin A. Vasudevan S.G. Lescar J. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 3209-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). One intriguing question remaining relates to the reason why NS3 carries in a single polypeptide chain two apparently disconnected enzymatic activities as follows: a proteolytic activity needed for post-translational processing of the viral polyprotein, and the helicase/ATPase/5′RNA triphosphatase activities required for viral RNA replication and 5′ RNA capping. The protease activity of the NS2B47NS3pro domain and the full-length NS2B47NS3 shows similar in vitro kinetics for both the West Nile virus (15Chappell K.J. Stoermer M.J. Fairlie D.P. Young P.R.

By contrast, both in terms of substrate specificity and helicase and ATPase activity, differences exist between NS2B47NS3, the proteolytically inactive NS2B18NS3 protein, the full-length NS3 protein, and the isolated NS3 helicase domain (16Chernov A.V. Shiryaev S.A. Aleshin A.E. Ratnikov B.I. Smith J.W. Liddington R.C. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 17270-17278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, several studies (6Xu T. Sampath A. Chao A. Wen D. Nanao M. Chene P. Vasudevan S.G. Lescar J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 10278-10288Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 10Luo D. Xu T. Hunke C.

Together, these data suggest that coupling and subsequent co-evolution of these two domains within a single polypeptide chain are functionally important, but a clear mechanistic and structural explanation remains elusive. Dengue virus dengue virus serotype 4 nonstructural protein 3 wild type Protein Data Bank 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. Here, the identification of an alternative stable conformation for the full-length NS2B18NS3 protein is reported. Although this crystal form was obtained using similar crystal growth conditions, the relative orientations between the protease and helicase domains differ markedly compared with the crystallographic structure of the NS2B18NS3 protein we reported previously and named “conformation I” (10Luo D. Xu T. Hunke C. Grüber G. Vasudevan S.G. Lescar J. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In its second conformation, the protease domain has rotated by an angle of ∼161° relative to the helicase domain. We find that ADP-Mn2+ can only be soaked into this new crystal form. To investigate the functional significance of the interdomain flexibility conferred by the linker region (residues 169ERIGEPDYEVD179) in terms of enzymatic activity and virus replication, a Gly residue before Pro174 (underlined) was introduced or the Pro residue was replaced with Gly in DENV4 NS2B18NS3. The mutant NS2B18NS3 protein having a glycine insertion in its linker region adopts conformation I, as shown by a crystal structure we report at 2.8 Å resolution. The analogous residue, Pro176 in a DENV2 replicon (17Ng C.Y. Gu F. Phong W.Y. Chen Y.L. Lim S.P. Davidson A. Vasudevan S.G. Antiviral Res. 2007; 76: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), was replaced, and the reporter gene activity as well as RNA replication were examined. The results are discussed in the context of possible orientations for NS3 with respect to perinuclear membranes and the likely impact that the intrinsic flexibility of NS3 has for viral polyprotein processing and RNA replication. The construct encoding the wild type DENV4 NS2B18NS3 protein was described before (10Luo D. Xu T. Hunke C. Grüber G. Vasudevan S.G. Lescar J. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as described previously (13Sampath A. Xu T. Chao A. Luo D. Lescar J. Vasudevan S.G. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 6686-6690Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Two mutants of NS2B18NS3 named “P174G” and Glu173-(inserted Gly)-Pro174 (named “E173GP174”) were generated using forward primers 5′-GAATTGGTGAGGGAGATTATGAAGTGGATGAGG-3′ and 5′-GCTGAAAGAATTGGTGAGGGCCCAGATTATGAAGTGG-3′ and reverse primers 5′-CCTCATCCACTTCATAATCTCCCTCACCAATTC-3′ and 5′-CCACTTCATAATCTGGGCCCTCACCAATTCTTTCAGC-3′, respectively. All mutations were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Transformed E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (Stratagene) was grown in LB medium containing 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin and 34 μg ml−1 chloramphenicol to an A600 nm of 0.6–0.8. Expression of the recombinant proteins was induced by the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-galactoside, and incubation was continued for a further 20 h at 16 °C. The cells were rapidly cooled and harvested by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and stored at −20 °C. The exchange of Gly for Pro176 was carried out in the previously characterized replicon DEN2repPAC2A-Rluc (17Ng C.Y. Gu F. Phong W.Y. Chen Y.L. Lim S.P. Davidson A. Vasudevan S.G. Antiviral Res. 2007; 76: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The overall strategy for genetic manipulation of the replicon required the removal of the KpnI site within the NS5 region by replacing the GGT ACC recognition sequence (nucleotide positions 9411–9416) with GGA ACA. The amino acids, glycine and threonine, coded by the two codons remain unchanged by the mutation. Primer pairs RepKpnIFor and NS5KpnInullRev were used to amplify a 4.9-kb fragment containing the last 29 nucleotides of NS2B, full-length NS3 and NS4A/B, and 1818 nucleotides of NS5, and the last 888 NS5 nucleotides and 3′-untranslated region were amplified by primer pair NS5KpnInullFor and RepXbaIRev. The replacement sequence GGA ACA was incorporated into primers NS5KpnInullRev and NS5KpnInullFor. Overlapping extension PCR was performed to join the 4.9- and 1.3-kb fragments to generate a 6.2-kb fragment that was ligated to KpnI- and XbaI-cut pBluescript II SK (pBSK). This plasmid pVAS4 was used as a template for the substitution of NS3Pro176 to Gly via site-directed mutagenesis to yield pVAS5. The 6.2-kb fragment now carrying the NS3P176G mutation was excised from pVAS5 and ligated to XbaI-digested and partial KpnI-digested DEN2repPAC2A-Rluc plasmid. Sequencing of the construct DENrepPAC2A-RlucNS3P176G confirmed correct insertion of the GGG triplet encoding Gly in place of Pro176. All genetic manipulations were carried out using E. coli strain DH5α. Cells were resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Na3PO4, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl) and lysed by sonication on ice. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing thioredoxin-His6-NS2B18NS3 was purified by metal affinity using a HistrapFF column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. Nonspecific proteins were eluted during column washing using 8% buffer B (20 mm Na3PO4, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 500 mm imidazole). Specific proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of imidazole from 40 to 500 mm in 30 min. Fractions containing thioredoxin-His6-NS2B18NS3 were dialyzed using phosphate-buffered saline, and the proteins were cleaved by thrombin (substrate-to-enzyme molar ratio of 500:1) at 4 °C for 20 h. After digestion, the mixture of NS2B18NS3 protein and thioredoxin-His6 tag was loaded onto a HisTrap FF column. NS2B18NS3 proteins were eluted using buffer A, and thioredoxin-His6 tag elutes using 100% buffer B. Finally, proteins used for enzymatic assays were buffer-exchanged into buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol) using a disposable PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare), concentrated to 30 mg ml−1, and stored at −80 °C. Proteins used for crystallization and surface plasmon resonance experiments were passed through a HiPrep Superdex-200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol), concentrated, and stored at −80 °C. The ATPase activity assay was performed as described previously (6Xu T. Sampath A. Chao A. Wen D. Nanao M. Chene P. Vasudevan S.G. Lescar J. J.

The assay was initiated by adding 10 μl of ATP and incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. 20 μl of Malachite green reagent was added and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The absorbance was measured immediately at 620 nm. The enzymatic Km value was calculated using initial rates for different ATP concentrations. Data were analyzed using Prism. Unwinding substrate was prepared by annealing of DNA (D1) (18-mer) and RNA (R2) (38-mer) oligonucleotides in a 1:2 ratio. To anneal the duplex, denaturation was carried out at 95 °C for 5 min in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) and slowly cooled down to room temperature. Sequences of the two oligonucleotides were as follows: D1, 5′-GCCTCGCTGCCGTCGCCA-3′, and R2, 5′-UGGCGACGGCAGCGAGGCUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-3′. To detect unwinding activity, D1 was labeled using biotin (Eurogentec S.A.) at the 3′ end. The reaction was performed in a volume of 10 μl containing 5 nm D1:R2 duplex, 500 nm protein (substrate:protein ratio of 1:100), excess of unlabeled D1 (duplex:unlabeled D1 ratio of 1:10), 5 mm ATP, 4 units of RNasin, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Tween 20, and 0.25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 1 μl of 10× loading dye (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, 50% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue). The reaction mixture was resolved on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel. The biotin signal could be detected by transferring to a Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (GE Healthcare) and probing the membrane with stabilized streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and lumigen-TMA6 substrate. The signal was quantified with QuantityOne software. The procedure was essentially as described previously (17Ng C.Y. Gu F. Phong W.Y. Chen Y.L. Lim S.P. Davidson A. Vasudevan S.G. Antiviral Res. 2007; 76: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Wild type replicon and replicon carrying the mutation (P176G) containing plasmids were linearized using XbaI. This was followed by in vitro transcription in the presence of mRNA cap analog using the T7 Ribomax system (Promega). After the transcription reaction, template DNA was removed by DNase I digestion, and the resulting RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform. The resuspended RNA was quantitated by spectrophotometry. For RNA electroporation, 2 × 106 BHK21 cells were washed before being resuspended in 0.4 ml of room temperature Ingenio electroporation buffer (Mirus) containing 10 μg of RNA. The cells were pulsed twice at 0.85 kV/25 microfarads in cuvettes using the GenePulser apparatus (Bio-Rad). A total of 5 × 103 cells were plated in triplicate in each well of a 96-well plate for each RNA and grown in complete growth media (RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum). Sixteen hours post-electroporation, fresh media were added. To measure luciferase activity, EnduRen (Promega) was added at a 1:1000 dilution and incubated for 2 h before the luminescence was read using Tecan Infinite plate reader. For normalization of transfection efficiency, the cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding β-galactosidase and assayed for β-galactosidase activity using a kit from Promega. BHK21 cells were electroporated with WT and mutant (P176G) replicon and allowed to grow for 24 h as described above. RNA was extracted from 2 × 106 cells using TRIzol. 500 ng of RNA was used in one-step reverse transcription-PCR using iScript kit (Bio-Rad). Real time PCR was performed using iQ5 iCycler (Bio-Rad) as follows: 1 μl of total RNA was used in the reaction with following primers: sense 5′-CCGCTGACATGAGTTTTGAGTC-3′ and antisense 5′-CATGACAGGAGACATCAAAGGA-3′ using following conditions: 50 °C for 10 min (room temperature) followed by 95 °C for 10 min (1 cycle), 95 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 20 s (40 cycles). For normalization, a real time reverse transcription-PCR was carried out using actin primers. The level of NS1, based on Ct (cycle number for level to reach above threshold), in wild type replicon was considered as 100%, and the change in NS1 level in mutant replicon-transfected cells was plotted as a bar graph as % change in viral RNA. Crystals of either NS2B18NS3 (conformation II) or the Gly insertion mutant hereafter named E173GP174 (that adopts conformation I, see Table 1) were grown at 13 °C by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method over wells containing 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, and 3–7.5% polyethylene glycol 3350. A volume of 2 μl of precipitating solution was mixed with an equal volume of either the NS2B18NS3 protein or the mutant E173GP174 at a concentration of 2.5–5 mg ml−1. For either protein, crystals grew as clusters of thin elongated plates over the course of 4–5 days to dimensions of ∼0.02 × 0.30 × 0.10 mm. For data collection, crystals were soaked for 24 h in a cryoprotecting solution containing 25% glycerol, 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, 25% polyethylene glycol 3350, before being mounted and cooled to 100 K in a nitrogen gas stream (Oxford Cryosystems). Diffraction intensities were collected at National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center, beamline 13B1 (Hsinchu, Taiwan). Diffraction intensities for mutant E173GP174 crystal were collected at the PXIII (X10SA) beamline at the Swiss Light Source, Paul Scherrer Institut, Villigen, Switzerland. Integration, scaling, and merging of the intensities were carried out using programs MOSFLM and SCALA from the CCP4 suite (19Collaborative Computational Project No. 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The structural state adopted by the NS2B18NS3 protein, reported using crystals grown at T = 18 °C, diffracting to a resolution of 3.15 Å (10Luo D. Xu T. Hunke C. Grüber G. Vasudevan S.G. Lescar J. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) will be referred to as conformation I. During our efforts to improve diffraction for this crystal form, we serendipitously identified a second, albeit closely related, crystal form (Table 1) where the NS2B18NS3 protein adopts a different conformation that we coin “conformation II.” The latter crystals have closely related crystal parameters and are obtained under similar crystallization conditions but at 13 °C. Experimental conditions for protein expression and purification were slightly modified; LB medium was used instead of an auto-induction expression method (24Studier F.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). The ion exchange step was omitted for purification to reduce sample loss. The homogeneity of the final protein was examined by SDS-PAGE and mass spectroscopy (supplemental Fig. 1). In our initial attempt to solve the structure, we used NS2B18NS3 in conformation I as a search model. Following the failure to find a consistent solution with the full-length protein, the helicase and protease domains were treated as two separate search probes, and this resulted in a correct structure solution that could be refined at 2.2 Å resolution to R and Rfree values of 22.8 and 27.2%, respectively (Table 2). The crystal structure for the native NS2B18NS3 protein in conformation II, determined to a resolution of 3 Å (data not shown), has the same conformation as the crystal form of NS2B18NS3-ADP-Mn2+ complex that was refined to 2.2 Å resolution. Thus, in the following, we used the higher resolution ADP-Mn2+ complex to discuss the conformation II adopted by NS2B18NS3. As was the case for conformation I, the NS2B18NS3 protein in conformation II adopts an elongated shape, in which the N-terminal protease domain resides next to the entrance of the ATPase active site between helicase subdomains 1 and 2 (10Luo D. Xu T. Hunke C. Grüber G. Vasudevan S.G. Lescar J. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, the relative orientation between the protease and helicase domains has changed drastically (Fig. 1A) due to an ∼161° rotation of the protease relative to the helicase domain (calculated using DynDom) (25Hayward S. Lee R.A. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2002; 21: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This new structural state is also consistent with the envelope determined ab initio using small angle x-ray scattering experiments in solution (10Luo D. Xu T. Hunke C. Grüber G. Vasudevan S.G. Lescar J. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The structures of individual domains remain intact, with root mean square deviations of 1.11 Å (146 Cα atoms) for the protease and 0.97 Å (439 Cα atoms) for the helicase domain, respectively. The interdomain contacts observed in conformation I between subdomain 2 of the helicase and the protease domain are lost. Only the linker that connects the protease and the helicase domains contributes to the interfac"

The structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis biofilms is formed through genetically programmed pathways and is built upon a large abundance of novel extracellular free mycolic acids (FM), although the mechanism of FM synthesis remained unclear. Here we show that the FM in Mycobacterium smegmatis biofilms is produced through the enzymatic release from constitutively present mycolyl derivatives. One of the precursors for FM is newly synthesized trehalose dimycolate (TDM), which is cleaved by a novel TDM-specific serine esterase, Msmeg_1529. Disruption of Msmeg_1529 leads to undetectable hydrolytic activity, reduced levels of FM in the mutant, and retarded biofilm growth. Furthermore, enzymatic hydrolysis of TDM remains conserved in M. tuberculosis, suggesting the presence of a TDM-specific esterase in this pathogen. Overall, this study provides the first evidence for an enzymatic release of free mycolic acids from cell envelope mycolates during mycobacterial growth.

Many microbial species grow as organized communities on surfaces and interfaces, forming a range of multicellular structures from colonies on submerged biotic and abiotic surfaces to pellicles at the air-medium interfaces (1Hall-Stoodley L.

Costerton J.W. Stoodley P. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (4851) Google Scholar). Individual cells within these biofilms are typically embedded in a complex architecture of extracellular matrices primarily composed of secreted polymeric substances including polysaccharides, lipids, proteins, and DNA (1Hall-Stoodley L. Stoodley P. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2002; 13: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 3Blankenship J.R. Mitchell A.P. Curr. Opin.

Science. 2002; 295: 1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar). Biofilm development involves coordinated communication between cells and programs of gene expression needed for individual cells to respond to varying microenvironments within the biofilm structure (10Henke J.M. Bassler B.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 648-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 11Kearns D.B. Chu F. Branda S.S. Kolter R. Losick R. Mol.

The architectural complexities of microbial biofilms, built on the scaffold of a extracellular matrix, lead to a widespread heterogeneity in the interior microenvironments to which the resident cells presumably adapt by adjusting their physiological and metabolic activities (13Teal T.K. Lies D.P. Wold B.J. Newman D.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 7324-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 14Stewart P.S. Franklin M.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). Therefore, heterogeneous microenvironments of biofilms foster a range of phenotypic diversity in the population and may even trigger cellular differentiation in the community (15Stoodley P. Sauer K. Davies D.G. Costerton J.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 187-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2191) Google Scholar, 16Vlamakis H. Aguilar C. Losick R. Kolter R. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Taken together, mature biofilms provide suitable microenvironments for the development of a subpopulation of stress-tolerant cells, which can persist against a wide range of environmental challenges including antibiotics (17McNeill K. Hamilton I.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 221: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Fux C.A. Costerton J.W. Stewart P.S. Stoodley P. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 34-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). The extraordinary drug tolerance of microbes in biofilms is particularly relevant in clinical settings where pathogens responsible for chronic infectious diseases such as cystic fibrosis, otitis media, infective endocarditis, and urinary tract infections colonize the host surfaces to form persistent and drug tolerant communities (19Post J.C.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of human tuberculosis, kills about 2 million people annually, and treatment of its infection requires 6–9 months of multidrug chemotherapy (23World Health OrganizationWHO Report 2009: Global Tuberculosis Control-Epidemiology, Strategy, Financing. World Health Organization, Geneva2009Crossref Google Scholar). These extended periods of chemotherapy are required to minimize relapse and reoccurrence of disease, presumably by eradicating the subpopulation of cells that escape the early phase of treatment (24Jindani A. Doré C.J. Mitchison D.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 167: 1348-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Although the basis for the tolerance of these persisters is not clear, the duration of treatment as well as the rate of relapse correlates closely with the bacterial burden in lung lesions such that the large number of bacilli associated with caseating granulomas and cavities may be especially difficult to eliminate by chemotherapy (25Centers for Disease ControlMorbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Vol. 52. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA2003: 1-77Google Scholar, 26Connolly L.E. Edelstein P.H. Ramakrishnan L. PLoS Med. 2007; 4: e120Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The microbiological nature of M. tuberculosis in these high burden infections remains unclear, although we note that in vitro M. tuberculosis bacilli form parallel rope-like cords in detergent-free growth medium as well as pellicles at the air-medium interface (27Middlebrook G.

Mutants of Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium marinum with defective biosynthesis of either cell wall or cell surface lipids like glycopeptidolipids, mycolyldiacylglycerol, and lipooligosaccharides fail to form biofilms (33Recht J.

Previously, we observed that mycolic acid synthesis during biofilm maturation of M. smegmatis was regulated by groEL1 through its direct interaction with KasA (a β-keto-acyl carrier protein synthase), a component of the multienzyme complex type II fatty acid synthase involved in mycolic acid synthesis (34Ojha A. Anand M. Bhatt A. Kremer L. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Hatfull G.F. Cell. 2005; 123: 861-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). We further found that M. tuberculosis biofilms also have substantial amounts of extracellular free mycolic acids (FM) (37Ojha A.K. Baughn A.D. Sambandan D. Hsu T. Trivelli X. Guerardel Y. Alahari A. Kremer L. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Hatfull G.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The abundance of FM in biofilms was novel in a way that mycolic acids have generally been understood to be present as esters of sugars, although the processes whereby FM is synthesized and released during biofilm formation remain unclear. Here we show that FM-rich M. smegmatis biofilms contain enzymatic activity that hydrolyzes trehalose dimycolate to release FM. We also identify a gene, Msmeg_1529, that encodes a cutinase-like serine carboxyesterase responsible for TDM hydrolysis. Disruption of Msmeg_1529 leads to loss of hydrolytic activity in the mutant. We further show that disrupted TDM synthesis through mutation in mycolyltransferases or TDM hydrolysis through mutation in Msmeg_1529 impairs biofilm development of M. smegmatis. All M. smegmatis strains were maintained in 7H9ADCTween liquid medium or on 7H10ADC agar. Mutants were grown in 150 μg/ml hygromycin and the complemented strains in 150 μg/ml hygromycin and 40 μg/ml kanamycin. For experiments, the strains were grown either planktonically or as biofilms in biofilm media as described previously (34Ojha A. Anand M. Bhatt A. Kremer L. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Hatfull G.F. Cell. 2005; 123: 861-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). An attenuated strain of M. tuberculosis mc27000 (37Ojha A.K. Baughn A.D. Sambandan D. Hsu T. Trivelli X. Guerardel Y. Alahari A. Kremer L. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Hatfull G.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) was used as a parent wild type in this study. The strain was maintained in 7H9OADC with 100 μg/ml pantothenic acid in liquid culture and on 7H11OADC + pantothenic acid on plates. For experiments, the strain was cultured in Sauton's medium with pantothenic acid before processing. All the genetic manipulations in M. smegmatis were carried using a recently developed recombineering technique in mycobacteria (53van Kessel J.C. Hatfull G.F. Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The allelic exchange substrate for every deletion was prepared by amplifying the left and right arms of the gene using primers listed in supplemental Table S1. The kanr, hygr recombinant colonies were screened for correct gene replacement by PCR. For complementation, the mutants were rescued of the recombineering plasmid, pJV53, and then transformed with complementing plasmids. The transformants were selected on 7H10ADC/hyg/kan. The complementing plasmids, pMs6398 and pMs1529, were constructed by cloning the PCR- amplified full-length ORF downstream of Phsp60 of pJL37 (54Lewis J.A. Hatfull G.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 350-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The primers used for amplification of Msmeg_6398 and Msmeg_1529 ORF are listed in supplemental Table S2. The total organic extractable apolar and polar lipids of mc2155, cultured either as biofilms or as a planktonic suspension, were extracted in petroleum ether as described previously (37Ojha A.K. Baughn A.D. Sambandan D. Hsu T. Trivelli X. Guerardel Y. Alahari A. Kremer L. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Hatfull G.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). For analysis of radiolabeled lipids, the cultures were exposed to [14C]glucose for 6 h before extraction in petroleum ether. The extracted lipids were developed on one- or two-dimensional TLC in the solvent systems as indicated for every experiment. The radiolabeled lipids were analyzed by autoradiography. The FM were developed in chloroform:methanol (96:4) and visualized by spraying the TLC plate with 5% molybdophosphoric acid in ethanol and charring the plate at 120 °C for 10 min. The TDM was developed in chloroform:methanol:water (90:10:1) and visualized by charring the plate with 10% H2SO4 in ethanol at 120 °C for 10 min. Methyl esters of FM and total cellular mycolic acids were prepared as described previously and resolved in hexane:diethyl ether (95:5) before visualizing the plate with 5% molybdophosphoric acids. The lipid spot migrating similar to M. tuberculosis FM in solvent C (37Ojha A.K. Baughn A.D. Sambandan D. Hsu T. Trivelli X. Guerardel Y. Alahari A. Kremer L. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Hatfull G.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) was extracted from the silica plate in chloroform:methanol (2:1) and analyzed by NMR and mass spectrometry. Similarly, lipid comigrating with a standard Mtb TDM (Sigma) was extracted from silica plate in chloroform:methanol (2:1) and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry analyses of purified mycolates and TDM were done on a Voyager Elite reflectron matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equipped with a 337-nm UV laser. Samples were solubilized in 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and mixed on target with 1 ml of a 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix solution (10 mg/ml dissolved in chloroform/methanol 2:1). For NMR analyses the same molecules were dissolved in deuterated chloroform containing 0.01% of tetramethylsilane and transferred into Shigemi tubes matched for D2O. Then 0.1 ml of deuterium oxide was added to avoid solvent evaporation during long acquisition. One-dimensional proton NMR spectra were recorded at 299 K on an 800 MHz Avance II Bruker spectrometers equipped with a 1H/13C/15N/2H probe. After structural confirmation of TDM and FM, the purified lipids were used as reference for all subsequent TLCs. For all the in vitro assays described, radiolabeled substrate, either total cellular lipids, TDM, or cell wall, equivalent to 100,000 cpm were homogeneously resuspended in the assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2% Triton N101) by mild sonication. The homogenate was then mixed to 100 μg of proteins from M. smegmatis lysates prepared from either planktonic or biofilm cells lysed by sonication in the assay buffer. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The lipids in the reaction mixture were extracted in an equal volume of petroleum ether, dried, and analyzed on TLC developed in chloroform:methanol 96:4. For testing the heat sensitivity of the active component, the biofilm lysate was incubated at 95 °C for 15 min before the assay. For assays with either purified TDM or cell wall, the radiolabeled homogenate in the assay was substituted with equivalent counts of TDM or cell wall, isolated using the previously described methods. For assay with purified proteins, 5 μg of Msmeg_1529 or D29 LysB were used. A search of serine esterase from M. smegmatis genome webpage of the J. Craig Venter Institute (Comprehensive Microbial Resource website of the J. Craig Venter Institute) revealed six ORFs. All six ORFs along with Msmeg_6398 were amplified using the primers listed in supplemental Table S3. The amplicons were cloned in the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET21b, and the recombinant plasmid expressing the ORFs was sequenced to confirm the clone identity. Each recombinant clone was then transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL-21 DE3. The transformants were grown in LB-ampicillin until A0.6 before being induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The induced cells were harvested, washed, and sonicated in assay buffer. 100 μg of total culture lysate protein was mixed with 100,000 cpm of purified [14C]TDM, and the esterase activity in the lysates were assayed as described above. A drug tolerance assay of M. smegmatis mc2155 in biofilms cultures was done as described previously (37Ojha A.K. Baughn A.D. Sambandan D. Hsu T. Trivelli X. Guerardel Y. Alahari A. Kremer L. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Hatfull G.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in biofilms for 5 days before exposing to 400 μg/ml rifampicin for 7 days. Before harvesting cells, the biofilms plates were incubated with 0.2% Tween 80 to solubilize the biofilms. The solubilized biofilms were then rocked in the presence of detergent and glass beads for 24 h at 4 °C. The homogeneous suspension of cells was then diluted and plated on 7H10 agar to determine their colony-forming units. We previously described the presence of FM in the biofilms of M. tuberculosis (37Ojha A.K. Baughn A.D. Sambandan D. Hsu T. Trivelli X. Guerardel Y. Alahari A. Kremer L. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Hatfull G.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), although the mechanisms underlying FM synthesis remained unclear. To further study the mechanism of FM synthesis, we sought to exploit the fast growing and non-pathogenic species M. smegmatis, which was preliminarily observed to make a lipid in biofilms that co-migrated with Mtb FM (37Ojha A.K. Baughn A.D. Sambandan D. Hsu T. Trivelli X. Guerardel Y. Alahari A. Kremer L. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Hatfull G.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Before undertaking a detailed study on FM synthesis in this species, we extended those preliminary studies and performed a complete lipid analysis using the same technique that we described for Mtb (37Ojha A.K. Baughn A.D. Sambandan D. Hsu T. Trivelli X. Guerardel Y. Alahari A. Kremer L. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Hatfull G.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). We examined total polar and apolar lipid synthesis in planktonic and biofilm cultures of M. smegmatis by 14C-labeling and two-dimensional thin layer chromatography (Fig. 1A). Apart from the large abundance of a lipid (marked as spot 1) corresponding to the position of Mtb FM (37Ojha A.K. Baughn A.D. Sambandan D. Hsu T. Trivelli X. Guerardel Y. Alahari A. Kremer L. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Hatfull G.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), we also noted two other major changes in biofilm cells; that is, increased levels of triacylglyceride (TG) and decreased levels of an unknown lipid (spot 2). There are other minor changes in the total lipids of the two cultures that we have not pursued further. Spot 1 was purified and structurally characterized by 1H NMR and mass spectrometry to be a mixture of free alpha and epoxy mycolic acids (supplemental Fig. S1). Further detailed analysis of this lipid by TLC is described in supplemental Fig. S1. The identity of spot 2 is described below. Because the nonessential M. smegmatis chaperone GroEL1 associates directly with the type II fatty acid synthase enzyme KasA during biofilm formation and is, therefore, directly implicated in M. smegmatis mycolic acid synthesis (34Ojha A. Anand M. Bhatt A. Kremer L. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Hatfull G.F. Cell. 2005; 123: 861-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), we asked whether the defect in the later stages of biofilm development of ΔgroEL-1 mutant correlate with decreased accumulation of FM. We determined the stage-specific synthesis of FM by radiolabeling the newly synthesized lipid for 6 h with [14C]acetate. We observed an ∼2.5-fold increase in radiolabeled mycolic acids from day 2 to day 4 of biofilm growth of wild type, and the induction was largely abrogated in the ΔgroEL1 mutant and could be restored in the complemented strain (Fig. 1B). Because a matured structure is important for drug tolerance behavior of M. tuberculosis biofilms (37Ojha A.K. Baughn A.D. Sambandan D. Hsu T. Trivelli X. Guerardel Y. Alahari A. Kremer L. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Hatfull G.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), we predicted that the drug tolerance in the wild-type M. smegmatis biofilms would also correlate with the induced synthesis of FM (Fig. 1B) and would progressively increase from the 2- to 4-day stage. Upon exposure to rifampicin there was a very sharp increase in the number of drug tolerant bacilli in 4-day biofilms compared with 2- and 3-day biofilms (Fig. 1C). Overall, these data together established a tight correlation between FM synthesis, structural maturation, and drug tolerance properties of M. smegmatis biofilms. Because GroEL1 is known to associate with the fatty acid synthase II enzyme KasA (34Ojha A. Anand M. Bhatt A. Kremer L. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Hatfull G.F. Cell. 2005; 123: 861-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), it seems unlikely that synthesis of FM in M. smegmatis biofilms involves an entirely new enzymatic pathway but, rather, derives from mycolic acid derivatives made by FAS-II. However, mycolic acids are typically esterified to other molecules with the major forms being mycolylarabinogalactan-peptidoglycan (mAGP), in which the mycolic acids are covalently linked to the cell wall components, and TDM, in which two mycolic acid chains are linked to the sugar trehalose (40Takayama K. Wang C. Besra G.S. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 18: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). These two molecules are, therefore, the major candidates for substrates for the generation of FM, although cellular esterases that hydrolyze these have not been described. We note though that the mycobacteriophage lysin B enzyme has recently been shown to cleave mAGP (41Payne K. Sun Q. Sacchettini J. Hatfull G.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and there are several mycobacterial cutinase-like proteins for which lipolytic activity has been reported (42West N.P. Chow F.M. Randall E.J. Wu J. Chen J. Ribeiro J.M. Britton W.J. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 1694-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that biofilm-grown cells contain an enzymatic activity responsible for synthesizing FM from precursor mycolic acid-containing substrates, planktonically grown M. smegmatis cells were labeled with [14C]glucose, and a total lysate was prepared; we then incubated this with a total extract prepared from unlabeled biofilm-grown cells (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2A, the planktonically grown substrate did not contain FM, but it was generated upon incubation with the biofilm extract (Fig. 2A). The activity in the biofilm extract is likely to be enzyme-mediated as heat treatment abolished the activity. Having determined that the biofilm extract contains the enzymatic activity of interest, we examined whether it was capable of generating FM from purified mAGP. However, no activity was observed, indicating that mAGP is not the immediate precursor for FM synthesis (Fig. 2B). We then tested this with TDM as a substrate using 14C-radiolabeled TDM purified from planktonically grown M. smegmatis (Fig. 2C). Because TDM from M. smegmatis is relatively uncharacterized, we purified the apolar lipid co-migrating with M. tuberculosis TDM and confirmed its identity by NMR and mass spectrometry (supplemental Fig. S2). We observed that the biofilm lysate has potent activity that released FM from TDM. However, we also observed a detectable activity in the planktonically grown cells (Fig. 2C). Although the product from planktonic lysate in Fig. 2C (fifth lane) appears to migrate slightly faster than reference FM (first lane), the difference in mobility was not reproducible. An activity of TDM esterase was also observed in lysates prepared from M. tuberculosis biofilms (Fig. 2D), suggesting that both species contain enzymes capable of cleaving TDM to generate FM. If TDM is a precursor for FM synthesis, then we predict that it is present at reduced levels as cells form mature biofilms. Indeed we observed that the synthesis of 14C-labeled TDM is reduced as cells mature from 2- to 4-day-grown M. smegmatis biofilms (Fig. 3A). We postulate that this likely arises from an increase in subsequent processing of synthesized TDM to yield FM. We note that a reduction also occurs in the ΔgroEL1 mutant, although this could arise from loss of synthesis (see Fig. 1B) as opposed to enhanced processing (Fig. 3A). Although the levels of newly synthesized TDM decreased during biofilm growth, the total amount of TDM in both the wild-type and mutant strains remained unchanged (Fig. 3B). It is likely that the site of TDM synthesis is spatially separated from its ultimate location on the outside of the cell envelope, which is then not accessible to the proposed biofilms esterase. We propose that when active synthesis of FM begins, the newly synthesized TDM that has yet to be delivered to its outer membrane location is captured and converted to FM by the esterase before translocation. Finally, we note that if newly synthesized TDM is the precursor for FM, then spot 2 in Fig. 1A, which is abundant in planktonically grown cells but barely detectable in biofilms (Fig. 1A), may correspond to TDM. To confirm this we purified spot 2 after two-dimensional TLC separation and showed that it has similar migration patterns as TDM isolated from both M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis (Fig. 3C). Because spot 2 in Fig. 1A was identified by a radio-TLC, we predicted that the difference in TDM levels of planktonic and 4-day biofilm cultures, like the one observed for early"

Here, we identified the molecular determinants of the interaction between TRPP2 and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), an intracellular Ca2+ channel in the endoplasmic reticulum. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown experiments combined with mutational analysis led to the identification of an acidic cluster in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of TRPP2 and a cluster of positively charged residues in the N-terminal ligand-binding domain of the IP3R as directly responsible for the interaction. To investigate the functional relevance of TRPP2 in the endoplasmic reticulum, we re-introduced the protein in TRPP2−/− mouse renal epithelial cells using an adenoviral expression system. The presence of TRPP2 resulted in an increased agonist-induced intracellular Ca2+ release in intact cells and IP3-induced Ca2+ release in permeabilized cells. Using pathological mutants of TRPP2, R740X and D509V, and competing peptides, we demonstrated that TRPP2 amplified the Ca2+ signal by a local Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release mechanism, which only occurred in the presence of the TRPP2-IP3R interaction, and not via altered IP3R channel activity. Moreover, our results indicate that this interaction was instrumental in the formation of Ca2+ microdomains necessary for initiating Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. The data strongly suggest that defects in this mechanism may account for the altered Ca2+ signaling associated with pathological TRPP2 mutations and therefore contribute to the development of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.

Grantham J.J. Schrier R.W. Gottschalk C.W. Diseases of the Kidney. 6th Ed. Little Brown and Company, Boston, MA1997: 521-560Google Scholar). ADPKD results in end-stage renal disease in ∼50% of the affected individuals by the age of 60. ADPKD arises as a consequence of mutations of two genes PKD1 and PKD2, encoding integral membrane proteins polycystin-1 (PKD1, ∼460 kDa) and polycystin-2 (TRPP2, ∼110 kDa), respectively. Most mutations identified in affected families appear to truncate and (or) inactivate either of both proteins (2Mochizuki T. Wu G. Hayashi T. Xenophontos S.L. Veldhuisen B. Saris J.J. Reynolds D.M. Cai Y. Gabow P.A. Pierides A. Kimberling W.J. Breuning M.H. Deltas C.C. Peters D.J. Somlo S. Science. 1996; 272: 1339-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar, 3Harris P.C. J. Am. Soc.

Kidney Int. 2009; 76: 149-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Mutations in PKD1 account for the vast majority (∼85%) of patients with ADPKD and are associated with a more severe clinical presentation and earlier onset of end-stage renal disease than the PKD2 phenotype (4Wu G. Somlo S. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 69: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, in all other aspects, PKD1 and PKD2 mutations produce virtually indistinguishable disease manifestations, indicating that the two proteins might function in a common signaling pathway involved in maintaining the terminally differentiated state of renal epithelial cells.TRPP2 is a 968-amino acid (aa) protein with six predicted transmembrane domains and is highly conserved among multicellular organisms and widely expressed in various tissues (2Mochizuki T. Wu G. Hayashi T. Xenophontos S.L. Veldhuisen B. Saris J.J. Reynolds D.M. Cai Y. Gabow P.A. Pierides A. Kimberling W.J. Breuning M.H. Deltas C.C. Peters D.J. Somlo S. Science. 1996; 272: 1339-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). Structural analyses indicate that TRPP2 contains several functional domains in its C-terminal tail. There are two Ca2+-binding sites (aa 680–796) arranged in a typical and an atypical EF-hand motif, which could be involved in a Ca2+-mediated regulation of TRPP2 (6Schumann F. Hoffmeister H. Bader R.

Biochemical and functional assays have demonstrated that the N-terminal part of TRPP2 is sufficient to bind the cardiac RyR2, whereas the C-terminal part of TRPP2 can only bind to RyR2 when it is in the open state, thereby inhibiting RyR function (22Anyatonwu G.I. Estrada M. Tian X. Somlo S. Ehrlich B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6454-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation assays indicated that TRPP2 physically interacts with the IP3R1, most likely through its C-terminal part (23Li Y. Wright J.M. Qian F. Germino G.G. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41298-41306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Recently Li et al. (24Li Y. Santoso N.G. Yu S. Woodward O.M. Qian F. Guggino W.B. J. Biol.

Several studies observed an enhancement of intracellular Ca2+ release that was attributed to an effect of TRPP2 (15Koulen P. Cai Y. Geng L. Maeda Y. Nishimura S. Witzgall R. Ehrlich B.E. Somlo S.

Chem. 2009; 284: 34400-34412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), but the physiological mechanism of action was not elucidated. On the other hand, Wegierski and co-workers (27Wegierski T. Steffl D. Kopp C. Tauber R. Buchholz B. Nitschke R. Kuehn E.W. Walz G. Köttgen M. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 490-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) observed that TRPP2 could also act as a passive Ca2+-leak channel in the ER, thereby lowering the Ca2+ concentration in the ER ([Ca2+]ER), which resulted in an opposite effect and decreased the magnitude of IICR. These controversial results illustrate that the exact mechanism through which polycystins in general and TRPP2 in particular modulate Ca2+ signaling is not yet understood. We therefore performed a detailed analysis of the molecular and functional relationship between the IP3R and TRPP2.Here, we identified a conserved positively charged cluster in the N-terminal suppressor domain of the IP3R and an acidic cluster located at the end of the ER-retention signal in the C-terminal tail of TRPP2 as being crucial for the interaction between both proteins. Moreover, in a background of renal epithelial TRPP2−/− cells, we observed a clear potentiation of both ATP-induced intracellular Ca2+ release in intact cells and IICR in permeabilized cells upon TRPP2 re-introduction. Further analysis using pathological mutants of TRPP2 and peptides that compete with the interaction between TRPP2 and the IP3R revealed that the observed increase in IICR required both a functional TRPP2 channel and a physical interaction with the IP3R. We suggest that TRPP2 functions as a tightly regulated channel in the ER that participates in an intracellular signaling complex together with the IP3R, thereby stimulating intracellular Ca2+ release within a microdomain in the immediate neighborhood of these interacting proteins.DISCUSSIONThe main finding of this study was that endogenous TRPP2-IP3R signaling complexes are responsible for the TRPP2-dependent potentiation of IICR. The novel findings in this work are: (i) the identification of residues responsible for the interaction, on TRPP2 as well as on the IP3R, which can now be targeted to disrupt or enhance the interaction; (ii) the mechanism responsible for the potentiated Ca2+ release, which was due to TRPP2 activity rather than to altered IP3R activity and that required a close association between TRPP2 and the IP3R to allow for a Ca2+ microdomain responsible for the activation of TRPP2; (iii) the finding that TRPP2 was not responsible for a passive Ca2+ leak from the ER; and (iv) the demonstration of CICR via TRPP2 in a cellular model. We conclude that an acidic cluster (aa 810–818) in the cytosolic C-terminal tail of TRPP2 and a positively charged cluster (aa 51–54) in the suppressor region of the LBD in the N terminus of the IP3R were required for their interaction. As a functional consequence of this interaction, we found that TRPP2 potentiated IICR. In a previous study (23Li Y. Wright J.M. Qian F. Germino G.G. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41298-41306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) it was postulated that the C-terminal part of TRPP2 could alter the activity of the IP3R. This conclusion was based on overexpression of the truncated C terminus or the channel-dead mutant in oocytes. Our data, however, do not provide evidence for a changed activity of the IP3R as the channel-dead mutant of TRPP2 had no effect on IICR in our experimental model, where we have carefully avoided overexpression to physiologically irrelevant levels. Rather, the enhanced Ca2+ release was most likely due to activation of CICR via TRPP2. This was concluded from our observation that the potentiation of IICR by TRPP2 was abolished in strong Ca2+-buffering conditions using 20 mm BAPTA, which reduces the microdomain of the elevated free [Ca2+] (41Hay J.C. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The difference between slow (EGTA) or fast (BAPTA) Ca2+ buffering is an established method to estimate the importance of the local [Ca2+]cyt rise in a microdomain close to Ca2+-release channels. For this observed CICR, activation by a local [Ca2+]cyt rise following IICR and the close proximity of the IP3R via a direct interaction with TRPP2 appeared to be required. The latter was also evident from our observation that a truncated TRPP2, which lacks the IP3R-binding site, did not provoke this potentiation of IICR. Moreover, the effect was also abolished by a peptide competing for the IP3R-binding site. An additional support for the importance of a close interaction between TRPP2 and the IP3R stems from the observation that a global [Ca2+]cyt rise as provoked by ionomycin or TG did not result in an increased TRPP2-induced Ca2+ signal. We propose a model (Fig. 8) where upon cell stimulation IP3 is produced and activates the IP3R, which leads to a local [Ca2+]cyt rise that subsequently can activate the TRPP2 channel as a CICR channel. Previous lipid-bilayer experiments have demonstrated regulation of the open probability of the TRPP2 channel by Ca2+ (25Cai Y. Anyatonwu G. Okuhara D. Lee K.B. Yu Z. Onoe T. Mei C.L. Qian Q. Geng L.

Chem. 2004; 279: 19987-19995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).Besides important functions of TRPP2 at the plasma membrane and the primary cilia, we now suggest another critical function for TRPP2 in the ER. We propose the existence of a signaling microdomain that requires a functional TRPP2/IP3R-protein complex to facilitate CICR by TRPP2. TRPP2 participates in an intracellular channel complex and potentiates intracellular IP3-mediated Ca2+ signaling. It has been shown in lipid bilayer experiments that TRPP2 is a Ca2+-dependent cation channel, whose activity shows a bell-shaped dependence on [Ca2+]cyt (15Koulen P. Cai Y. Geng L. Maeda Y. Nishimura S. Witzgall R. Ehrlich B.E. Somlo S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 25Cai Y. Anyatonwu G. Okuhara D. Lee K.B. Yu Z. Onoe T. Mei C.L. Qian Q. Geng L. Wiztgall R. Ehrlich B.E. Somlo S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19987-19995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The activation phase of the CICR via TRPP2 was reported to have micromolar affinity (25Cai Y. Anyatonwu G. Okuhara D. Lee K.B. Yu Z. Onoe T. Mei C.L. Qian Q. Geng L. Wiztgall R. Ehrlich B.E. Somlo S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19987-19995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Given the relatively high [Ca2+] predicted at the mouth of the IP3R at the ER surface (34Foskett J.K. White C. Cheung K.H. Mak D.O. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 593-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 42Neher E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 389-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), a micromolar affinity for Ca2+ may allow TRPP2 to sense such local changes in [Ca2+]cyt. Recent studies on the structure of the EF-hand within the cytosolic C terminus of TRPP2 have brought new insights into the conformational changes that occur upon Ca2+ binding (6Schumann F. Hoffmeister H. Bader R. Schmidt M. Witzgall R. Kalbitzer H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24372-24383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 8Celić A. Petri E.T. Demeler B. Ehrlich B.E. Boggon T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28305-28312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the direct link between Ca2+ binding to the EF-hand of TRPP2 and its Ca2+-dependent channel regulation has not been demonstrated yet and requires further research. Furthermore, loss of phosphorylation of TRPP2 (Ser810) can shift the bell-shaped [Ca2+]cyt dependence of TRPP2 channel activity to the right (25Cai Y. Anyatonwu G. Okuhara D. Lee K.B. Yu Z. Onoe T.

Given our results from the binding assay with the phosphomimic acidic cluster peptide (Fig. 3B), reduced binding of TRPP2 to the IP3R may be one of the mechanisms responsible for the observed decrease in sensitivity to Ca2+ upon dephosphorylation.Intracellular Ca2+ signaling modulated by TRPP2 is important for regulating various cellular processes including cell proliferation. Loss of TRPP2 results in increased cell proliferation in ADPKD and this is one of the mechanisms leading to cyst formation (5Torres V.E. Harris P.C. Kidney Int. 2009; 76: 149-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 43Chang M.-Y. Ong A.C. Nephron Physiol. 2008; 108: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It has been reported that ADPKD cystic cells have a lower [Ca2+]cyt, probably due to a loss of TRPP2 channel function (44Yamaguchi T. Hempson S.J. Reif G.A. Hedge A.M. Wallace D.P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 178-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Increased levels of cAMP and cAMP-dependent genes (such as aquaporin 2) are also a common finding in the kidneys of different ADPKD animal models. In ADPKD or under Ca2+ deprivation conditions, cAMP stimulates cell proliferation in an Src-, Ras-, and B-Raf-dependent manner (45Yamaguchi T. Nagao S. Wallace D.P. Belibi F.A. Cowley B.D. Pelling J.C. Grantham J.J. Kidney Int. 2003; 63: 1983-1994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In view of the role of Ca2+ in the regulation of cAMP metabolism via Ca2+-inhibitable adenylyl cyclase 6 and/or via Ca2+-dependent phosphodiesterase-1, it has already been suggested that alterations in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis account for the increase in cAMP levels (5Torres V.E. Harris P.C. Kidney Int. 2009; 76: 149-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that the increased Ca2+ signaling in IP3R/TRPP2 microdomains may be operative in controlling cellular cAMP levels by Ca2+ inhibitable adenylyl cyclases. Taken together, the previous findings strongly suggest that the mechanisms regulating [Ca2+]cyt form potential therapeutic targets for ADPKD.Not only proliferation, but also apoptosis is an important Ca2+-regulated cellular process that is impaired in ADPKD, although this might be rather a consequence than a cause of cyst formation. Recently, Wegierski et al. (27Wegierski T. Steffl D. Kopp C. Tauber R. Buchholz B. Nitschke R. Kuehn E.W. Walz G. Köttgen M. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 490-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have proposed a role for ER-located TRPP2 in apoptosis. They have found that TRPP2 can lower the ER Ca2+ content, thereby protecting against apoptosis. In contrast to our data and previous work (15Koulen P. Cai Y. Geng L. Maeda Y. Nishimura S. Witzgall R. Ehrlich B.E. Somlo S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 23Li Y. Wright J.M. Qian F. Germino G.G. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41298-41306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), they observed that TRPP2 diminished cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals induced by IP3R activation. Because they observed a decreased ER Ca2+ content in TRPP2 overexpressing cells, it appeared that those cells have a diminished Ca2+ release upon IP3R activation. In contrast, we could neither detect a change in [Ca2+]ER nor in passive Ca2+ leak (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S7), and we consistently observed an increase in IICR (Fig. 5B). A difference in our experimental cell model is that we did not overexpress TRPP2, but chose expression levels comparable with endogenous levels of TRPP2 (supplemental Fig. S4). In basal conditions, the TRPP2 channel is expected to be silent and inhibited by the endogenous protein syntaxin-5 (46Geng L. Boehmerle W. Maeda Y. Okuhara D.Y. Tian X. Yu Z. Choe C.U. Anyatonwu G.I. Ehrlich B.E. Somlo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 15920-15925Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When TRPP2 is overexpressed, it is possible that the endogenous level of syntaxin-5 is not sufficient to maintain this basal inhibition of TRPP2.In summary, we observed a clear interaction between TRPP2 and the IP3R and identified a conserved positively charged cluster in the N-terminal suppressor domain of the IP3R and an acidic cluster located at the end of the ER-retention signal in the C terminus of TRPP2 as being crucial for their interaction. When full-length TRPP2 was re-introduced in TRPP2−/− mouse renal epithelial cells, there was a clear potentiation of agonist-induced intracellular Ca2+ release in intact cells and IICR in permeabilized cells. Further analysis using pathological mutants of TRPP2 and competing peptides revealed that this effect on IICR was dependent on the TRPP2 channel function and on the interaction with the IP3R. We propose a model in which the TRPP2 channel itself is activated as a CICR channel by a local [Ca2+]cyt rise generated by IICR (Fig. 8).We conclude that a signaling complex involving TRPP2 and the IP3R is important for modulating intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Disturbance of this interaction, which occurs in pathologically relevant mutants of TRPP2, will lead to altered intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and might contribute to the development of ADPKD caused by loss-of-function mutations in TRPP2.

Grantham J.J. Schrier R.W. Gottschalk C.W. Diseases of the Kidney. 6th Ed. Little Brown and Company, Boston, MA1997: 521-560Google Scholar). ADPKD results in end-stage renal disease in ∼50% of the affected individuals by the age of 60. ADPKD arises as a consequence of mutations of two genes PKD1 and PKD2, encoding integral membrane proteins polycystin-1 (PKD1, ∼460 kDa) and polycystin-2 (TRPP2, ∼110 kDa), respectively. Most mutations identified in affected families appear to truncate and (or) inactivate either of both proteins (2Mochizuki T. Wu G. Hayashi T. Xenophontos S.L. Veldhuisen B. Saris J.J. Reynolds D.M.

https://openalex.org/W2033590347,"Aggregation and misfolding of the prion protein (PrP) are thought to be the cause of a family of lethal neurodegenerative diseases affecting humans and other animals. Although the structures of PrP from several species have been solved, still little is known about the mechanisms that lead to the misfolded species. Here, we show that the region of PrP comprising the hairpin formed by the helices H2 and H3 is a stable independently folded unit able to retain its secondary and tertiary structure also in the absence of the rest of the sequence. We also prove that the isolated H2H3 is highly fibrillogenic and forms amyloid fibers morphologically similar to those obtained for the full-length protein. Fibrillization of H2H3 but not of full-length PrP is concomitant with formation of aggregates. These observations suggest a ""banana-peeling"" mechanism for misfolding of PrP in which H2H3 is the aggregation seed that needs to be first exposed to promote conversion from a helical to a beta-rich structure."
https://openalex.org/W1988689671,"Background Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) belongs to a class of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that serve as micropollutants in the environment. B[a]P has been reported as a probable carcinogen in humans. Exposure to B[a]P can take place by ingestion of contaminated (especially grilled, roasted or smoked) food or water, or inhalation of polluted air. There are reports available that also suggests neurotoxicity as a result of B[a]P exposure, but the exact mechanism of action is unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings Using neuroblastoma cell line and primary cortical neuron culture, we demonstrated that B[a]P has no direct neurotoxic effect. We utilized both in vivo and in vitro systems to demonstrate that B[a]P causes microglial activation. Using microglial cell line and primary microglial culture, we showed for the first time that B[a]P administration results in elevation of reactive oxygen species within the microglia thereby causing depression of antioxidant protein levels; enhanced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, that results in increased production of NO from the cells. Synthesis and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines were also elevated within the microglia, possibly via the p38MAP kinase pathway. All these factors contributed to bystander death of neurons, in vitro. When administered to animals, B[a]P was found to cause microglial activation and astrogliosis in the brain with subsequent increase in proinflammatory cytokine levels. Conclusions/Significance Contrary to earlier published reports we found that B[a]P has no direct neurotoxic activity. However, it kills neurons in a bystander mechanism by activating the immune cells of the brain viz the microglia. For the first time, we have provided conclusive evidence regarding the mechanism by which the micropollutant B[a]P may actually cause damage to the central nervous system. In today's perspective, where rising pollution levels globally are a matter of grave concern, our study throws light on other health hazards that such pollutants may exert."

The ligand-free CYP105D6 structure was also determined. A small sub-pocket accommodating the long alkyl side chain of filipin I was observed in the CYP105P1 structure but was absent in the CYP105D6 structure, indicating that filipin cannot bind to CYP105D6 with a similar orientation due to steric hindrance.

A small sub-pocket accommodating the long alkyl side chain of filipin I was observed in the CYP105P1 structure but was absent in the CYP105D6 structure, indicating that filipin cannot bind to CYP105D6 with a similar orientation due to steric hindrance. This observation can explain the strict regiospecificity of these enzymes. Macrolide compounds have toxic effects on a wide variety of organisms including pathogens, and therefore, their clinical use as antibiotics has been widely developed (1Omura S.

Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The major component (53%) is filipin III, and its stereochemical configuration has been determined (21Rychnovsky S.D.

Rinehart Jr., K.L. Millington D.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 4306-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A solution NMR study has shown that the large 28-membered ring is rigid, stabilized by both intramolecular hydrogen bonds of syn 1,3-polyols and a conjugated pentaene moiety, whereas the lateral aliphatic chain is highly flexible (26Volpon L. Lancelin J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A gene cluster for filipin biosynthesis was recently identified in the genome of Streptomyces avermitilis (27Ikeda H. Ishikawa J. Hanamoto A. Shinose M. Kikuchi H. Shiba T. Sakaki Y. Hattori M. Omura S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). The gene cluster contains two P450 genes, CYP105P1 (PteC, SAV413) and CYP105D6 (PteD, SAV412) as well as genes encoding modular polyketide synthases (pteA1-pteA5), ferredoxin (fdxI, pteE), and putative zinc binding dehydrogenase (pteB). The filipin biosynthetic gene cluster is regulated by the negative regulator aveI along with the biosynthetic genes for other antibiotics including avermectin and oligomycin (28Chen L. Chen J. Jiang Y. Zhang W. Jiang W. Lu Y. FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2009; 298: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Analysis of P450 gene deletion mutants revealed that CYP105P1 and CYP105D6 catalyze hydroxylations at positions C26 and C1′, respectively. 3H. Ikeda, M. Doi, A. Arisawa, Y. Fujii, and S. Ōmura, unpublished data. The amino acid sequence identity between CYP105P1 and CYP105D6 is 36.7% when the whole lengths of both sequences are used for alignment. We previously reported the crystal structures of CYP105P1 in three different states (29Xu L.H. Fushinobu S. Ikeda H. Wakagi T. Shoun H. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The ligand-free wild-type structure provides a unique state in which the His-72 residue in the BC loop is ligated to the heme iron atom. When compared with the 4-phenylimidazole-bound wild-type and ligand-free H72A mutant structures, it is suggested that the high flexibility of the BC loop of this enzyme is a key feature for incorporating the large hydrophobic filipin substrate. In this report we present two crystal structures of the filipin hydroxylases: the structures of CYP105P1-filipin I complex and ligand-free CYP105D6. Our present study provides a concrete structural basis for filipin hydroxylation at position C26 and an insight into the different substrate specificities of these similar P450 enzymes, both belonging to the CYP105 family. CYP105P1 protein was expressed and purified as described previously (29Xu L.H. Fushinobu S. Ikeda H. Wakagi T. Shoun H. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The primers used to amplify the CYP105D6 gene were 5′-CCC ATA TGA CTG AGA CCG AAA TCC GCC TC-3′ and 5′-GGA CTA GTT CAG TGG TGG TGG TGC CAG ACG ACG GGG AGC TCG ATC-3′ (bold type and underlined sequences represent the restriction endonuclease sites and His4 tag, respectively). The expression plasmid was constructed using pET-17b (Novagen, Madison, WI). CYP105D6 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli C43 (DE3) cultured in Terrific Broth medium containing 12 g/liter Bacto-tryptone, 24 g/liter yeast extract, 8 g/liter glycerol, 17 mm KH2PO4, 72 mm K2HPO4, and 100 mg/l ampicillin at 25 °C for 24 h. After the correction of the cells by centrifugation, cells were suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Cell extracts were obtained by sonication and followed by centrifugation to remove cell debris. A fraction containing the protein was purified on a HiTrap Chelating HP 5-ml column (GE Healthcare) with a linear gradient of 10–500 mm imidazole. After dialysis, the protein was further purified on a Resource Q column (GE Healthcare) with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl. The final step of purification was on a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) separated with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. The purified enzyme appeared as a single band corresponding to a molecular mass of 44 kDa on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The absorbance ratio of proteins purified in this manner was greater than 2.0 at 420 nm as compared with that at 280 nm. The P450 content measured by CO difference spectroscopy was also checked to verify purification quality. Spores of S. avermitilis strain ΔpteC/pteD were inoculated into a medium containing 5 g/liter glucose, 15 g/liter soy flour, and 5 g/liter yeast extract (pH 7.0) and cultured with agitation at 30 °C for 48 h. A portion of the culture (1% seed) was inoculated into filipin production medium containing 20 g/liter dextrin, 2 g/liter glucose, 15 g/liter soy flour, 3 g/liter yeast extract, and 3 g/liter CaCO3 (pH 7.0) and cultured at 30 °C for 5 days on a rotary shaker. Mycelia from the culture medium (3 liters) were collected using a Büchner funnel and extracted twice with acetone. The sample was concentrated using a rotary evaporator, transferred to a separating funnel, and extracted twice with ethyl acetate. Solid anhydrous sodium sulfate was added for dehydration and then concentrated to dryness. The sample was dissolved with chloroform and then placed into a silica gel column (60 × 400 mm) eluted with chloroform/methanol (1:0, 10:1, and 4:1). The eluate was collected in 15-ml fractions. The retention time of a yellow band containing filipin I was about 30 min in chloroform/methanol (4:1). The sample was concentrated to dryness, dissolved with methanol, and filtered. The compound was finally purified by preparative HPLC (Pegasil-ODS 20 × 250 mm, Senshu Scientific Co., Tokyo, Japan) eluted with acetonitrile/methanol/water 55:20:25 at 340 nm of UV detection at a 9 ml/min flow rate. The separated compound was concentrated by evaporation and extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The extract was concentrated to dryness using an evaporator and dried in a vacuum desiccator. UV-visible absorption spectra measurements and titration experiments were performed essentially using the same methods as described previously (29Xu L.H. Fushinobu S. Ikeda H. Wakagi T. Shoun H. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For the titrations of filipin I to CYP105P1, 1 ml of assay buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol was used. The protein concentration was 5.1 μm, and 2 mm filipin I stock solution was added. A nonlinear fitting with a quadratic equation was applied to determine the Kd using Kaleidagraph (Synergy, Reading, PA): ΔA = (Bmax/2E){(Kd + E + L) − {(Kd + E + L)2 − 4E/L}1/2}, where Bmax is the maximum absorbance difference extrapolated to infinite ligand enzyme concentration, L is the ligand concentration, and E is the total enzyme concentration. The reaction mixture (200 μl) contained 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm NADPH, 0.05 units of spinach ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase (Sigma), 0.015 mg of spinach ferredoxin (Sigma), 0.2 mm filipin I, and 1 μm P450 enzyme. The reaction was started by adding NADPH, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. The reaction was terminated by mixing with 1.5-fold volume of ethyl acetate. The mixture was centrifuged at 6000 × g for 1 min to separate phases, and a portion of the ethyl acetate layer was concentrated to dryness using a centrifugal evaporator. The sample was dissolved with methanol and subjected to analytical HPLC (Pegasil-ODS 4.6 × 250 mm, Senshu Scientific Co.) at a 0.8 ml/min flow rate. The peak position of each compound was determined according to a previous study; the structure of each compound was analyzed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, 1H NMR and 13C NMR.3 Filipin III, filipin II, 1′-hydroxyfilipin I, and filipin I eluted at 4.6, 7.2, 11.3, and 21.2 min, respectively. For crystallization, protein was concentrated to >20 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA (protein solution buffer). Before crystallization, filipin I was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, mixed with a CYP105P1 sample, and concentrated using an Ultrafree Centrifugal Filter Device (Millipore, Billerica, MA). After three mixing cycles with filipin I and concentration by the centrifugal filter device, three more mixing cycles with the protein solution buffer and concentration were performed to remove unbound filipin I from the solution. Crystallization was performed using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. CYP105P1 crystals complexed with filipin I were grown at 25 °C by mixing 1 μl of the protein solution (10 mg/ml protein) and 1 μl of the reservoir solution containing 2.0 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.2 m Li2SO4, and 0.1 mN-cyclohexyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid (pH 10.5). CYP105D6 crystals were grown at 25 °C by mixing 1 μl of the protein solution (8 mg/ml protein) and 1 μl of the reservoir solution containing 4.0 m sodium formate (pH 8.0). X-ray diffraction data were collected at the BL-5A and NW12A stations at the Photon Factory, High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK), Tsukuba, Japan. After cryoprotection with 20% (v/v) glycerol, crystals were flash-cooled in a nitrogen stream at 100 K. Diffraction images were processed using the HKL2000 program suite (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The initial phases were determined by molecular replacement using MOLREP (31Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Cryst. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4175) Google Scholar). The ligand-free CYP105P1 structure was used as a search model. Manual model rebuilding, introduction of water molecules, and refinement were performed using Coot (32Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) and Refmac5 (33Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). The topology and parameter file for filipin I was generated based on the solution NMR structure of filipin III (26Volpon L. Lancelin J.

Open table in a new tab Recombinant proteins of CYP105P1 and CYP105D6 with His4 tag at the C termini were expressed in E. coli cells and purified to homogeneity. Spectral characterization of purified CYP105P1 has been described previously (29Xu L.H. Fushinobu S. Ikeda H. Wakagi T. Shoun H. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). UV-visible absorption spectra of purified CYP105D6 in the ferric (resting), dithionite-reduced, and dithionite-reduced plus CO states are shown in supplemental Fig. S2. These spectra show that the protein was folded properly. To examine the substrate specificities of CYP105P1 and CYP105D6 in vitro, the purified enzymes and filipin I were incubated with the electron transport system of spinach ferredoxin and reductase (Fig. 1). Filipin I was produced and purified from a mutant S. avermitilis strain in which both CYP105P1 and CYP105D6 genes were deleted (ΔpteC/pteD).3 After incubation with CYP105P1, 50.2% of filipin I was converted to filipin II (Fig. 1B). The reaction product was extracted by ethyl acetate and then incubated with CYP105D6 (Fig. 1C). The second reaction resulted in 43.0% conversion to filipin III, and 15.8, 24.4, and 16.8% of filipin II, 1′-hydroxyfilipin, and filipin I were detected. Therefore, in the second reaction catalyzed by CYP105D6, 73.1% of filipin II and 69.2% of filipin I were converted to filipin III and 1′-hydroxyfilipin I, respectively. After incubation with CYP105D6, 34.6% of filipin I was converted to 1′-hydroxyfilipin I (Fig. 1D). Subsequent reaction with CYP105P1 resulted in 27.5% conversion to filipin III and 47.5, 7.6, and 17.4% of filipin II, 1′-hydroxyfilipin, and filipin I were detected. Therefore, in the second reaction catalyzed by CYP105P1, 57.9% of 1′-hydroxyfilipin I and 73.2% of filipin I were converted to filipin III and filipin II, respectively. These results indicated that these enzymes hydroxylate filipin I at different positions. The activity against filipin I was higher for CYP105P1 than CYP105D6. In addition to filipin I, CYP105P1 and CYP105D6 can hydroxylate 1′-hydroxyfilipin I and filipin II, respectively. CYP105D6 showed preference to filipin II over filipin I, and CYP105P1 showed preference to filipin I over 1′-hydroxyfilipin I. FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3 show spectral titration results of CYP105P1 and CYP105D6 with filipin I, respectively. The spectra of CYP105P1 illustrate a typical type I spectral shift of the Soret peak (419 nm) to 391 nm. The spectral change of CYP105D6 was relatively smaller, but the difference spectrum clearly shows a type I shift. Filipin I has three absorption maxima around the 320–360-nm region and a shoulder at 305 nm due to vibrational progression of a polyene (19Whitfield G.B. Brock T.D. Ammann A. Gottlieb D. Carter H.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955; 77: 4799-4801Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These peaks exhibited perturbations on binding to CYP105P1 and CYP105D6, and positive peaks were observed in the difference spectra at 329–330, 346–347, and 362–368 nm. The titration curve of CYP105P1 indicated strong binding to the ligand with a stoichiometry of about 1:1 ∼ 2:1. Due to the high affinity, the Kd value of CYP105P1 was difficult to determine. The Kd value was estimated to be 0.66 ± 0.18 μm for CYP105D6. Therefore, CYP105P1 showed higher binding affinity to filipin I than CYP105D6, exhibiting a good correlation with the catalytic activity.FIGURE 3Spectral changes of CYP105D6 (ferric resting state) upon the addition of increasing concentrations of filipin I (A), its difference spectra (B), and the titration curve calculated using the values of absorption differences at 387 and 420 nm (C). A nonlinear fitting with a quadratic equation was applied to the titration curve.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The crystal structure of CYP105P1-filipin I complex was determined at 1.8 Å resolution and refined to an R factor of 18.8% (Rfree = 23.8%). The crystal contains one molecule in the asymmetric unit and exhibits a high Matthews coefficient (3.51 Å3/Da) and solvent content (65.0%). The final model contains residues from Asp-7 to His-403, including all four residues of the His tag: one heme, one filipin I molecule, 592 waters, and three sulfate ions. Fig. 4A shows the overall structure of CYP105P1. The electron density map for bound filipin I was clearly observed in the distal pocket as shown in Fig. 5A. Superimpositions with the ligand-free wild-type and H72A mutant structures are shown in Fig. 6. The FG helices in the ligand-free structures adopt an open conformation and close on substrate binding.

Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Prenum Publishers, New York2005Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The BC loop region in the ligand-free wild-type structure has a unique conformation due to ligation of His-72 to the heme iron and completely covers the distal pocket (Fig. 6A), but this histidine ligation state is not detectable in solution (29Xu L.H. Fushinobu S. Ikeda H. Wakagi T. Shoun H. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The BC loop adopts an open conformation in the H72A mutant structure (29Xu L.H. Fushinobu S. Ikeda H. Wakagi T. Shoun H. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and is only slightly closed in the complex structure (Fig. 6B). Compared with the H72A mutant structure, the Cα atoms of Asp-176 in the FG loop and Asp-75 in the BC loop shift by 8.7 and 2.6 Å, respectively. Root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d.) with previously determined structures are shown in supplemental Table S1. The long axis of the 28-membered filipin I ring was inclined at about 60 degrees from the vertical axis of the heme plane, and the pro-S hydrogen side of position C26 is directed toward the heme (Fig. 5). The distance between the C26 atom and heme iron is 5.0 Å, which appears to be appropriate for a monooxygenase reaction (discussed later). The filipin I molecule is surrounded by the heme, BC loop, FG loop, G helix, I helix, and C-terminal loop regions. The amino acid residues forming the pocket are as follows: Thr-79—Pro-82 and Ser-86—Trp-89 in the BC loop; Met-172—Met-173 in the FG loop; Thr-182—Glu-183, Gly-186—Met-187, and Leu-189—Gly-190 in the G helix; Met-228—Asn-229, Gly-232—Thr-233, and Ile-236—Ala-238 in the I helix; Val-388—Phe-389 in the C-terminal loop (Fig. 5B). Among these, Gln-80 and Pro-82 are the only two residues to form direct hydrogen bonds with filipin I. The flat 28-membered filipin I ring is sandwiched between two hydrophobic faces. The β-face of the ring (see Rose et al. (40Rose I.A. Hanson K.R. Wilkinson K.D. Wimmer M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1980; 77: 2439-2441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the definition) is recognized by Pro-82, Leu-88, and Trp-89, and the α-face is recognized by Met-172, Met-173, Val-388, and Phe-389. The C1 hydroxyl group of filipin I interacts with a carboxylate moiety of heme through water-mediated hydrogen bonds. The pocket at the polyol side of filipin I is filled with numerous water molecules (Fig. 5C), and they mediate interactions with the FG loop, G helix, and BC loop regions. About 30 water molecules are"

In this response, mGlu7 receptor triggers pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein activation, reducing presynaptic Ca2+ influx and the subsequent depolarization evoked release. Here we report that receptor coupling to signaling pathways that potentiate release can be seen following prolonged exposure of nerve terminals to the agonist l-(+)-phosphonobutyrate, l-AP4. This novel mGlu7 receptor response involves an increase in the release induced by the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, suggesting a mechanism that is independent of Ca2+ channel activity, but dependent on the downstream exocytotic release machinery. The mGlu7 receptor-mediated potentiation resists exposure to pertussis toxin, but is dependent on phospholipase C, and increased phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate hydrolysis. Furthermore, the potentiation of release does not depend on protein kinase C, although it is blocked by the diacylglycerol-binding site antagonist calphostin C. We also found that activation of mGlu7 receptors translocate the active zone protein essential for synaptic vesicle priming, munc13-1, from soluble to particulate fractions. We propose that the mGlu7 receptor can facilitate or inhibit glutamate release through multiple pathways, thereby exerting homeostatic control of presynaptic function.

Most group III mGlu receptors (mGlu4, -6, -7, and -8 receptors) are located within the presynaptic active zone (1Shigemoto R. Kulik A. Roberts J.D. Ohishi H. Nusser Z. Kaneko T. Somogyi P. Nature. 1996; 381: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) where they act as autoreceptors mediating feedback inhibition of glutamate release (2Forsythe I.D. Clements J.D. J.

Miras-Portugal M.T. Sánchez-Prieto J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The signaling mechanism initiated by mGlu7 receptors to inhibit neurotransmitter release involves the activation of Gi/o proteins that inhibit Ca2+ channels and adenylyl cyclase (5Millán C. Luján R. Shigemoto R. Sánchez-Prieto J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14092-14101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and probably the release process itself (6Blackmer T.

However, mGlu7 receptor signaling is not restricted to these pathways. Thus, transfected mGlu7 receptors expressed in cerebellar granule cells inhibits somatic Ca2+ currents by a mechanism that involves the activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate thereby generating inositol trisphosphate that releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores and diacylglycerol (DAG) that activates protein kinase C (PKC) (7Perroy J. Prezeau L. De Waard M. Shigemoto R. Bockaert J. Fagni L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7896-7904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, one important question that remains to be resolved is whether endogenous mGlu7 receptors at synaptic sites also signal via PLC and if so, what effect such signaling has on release modulation.

DAG signaling at synapses has long been thought to be mediated by PKC and both presynaptic K+ and Ca2+ channels, as well as other proteins of the release machinery, have been identified as PKC substrates. In addition to PKC activation, phorbol esters can also activate munc13-1, a presynaptic protein with an essential role in synaptic vesicle priming (16Betz A. Ashery U. Rickmann M. Augustin I. Neher E. Südhof T.C. Rettig J. Brose N. Neuron. 1998; 21: 123-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 17Rhee J.S. Betz A. Pyott S. Reim K. Varoqueaux F. Augustin I. Hesse D. Südhof T.C. Takahashi M. Rosenmund C. Brose N. Cell. 2002; 108: 121-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). However, there is little information regarding the presynaptic receptors coupled to signaling pathways involved in synaptic potentiation. Presynaptic PLC activation in response to high frequency stimulation results in synaptic potentiation due to increased neurotransmitter release in hippocampal neurons (18Rosenmund C. Sigler A. Augustin I. Reim K. Brose N. Rhee J.S. Neuron. 2002; 33: 411-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). As high frequency stimulation increases synaptic glutamate enough to activate low affinity mGlu7 receptors (19Pelkey K.A. Lavezzari G. Racca C. Roche K.W. McBain C.J. Neuron. 2005; 46: 89-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), it remains unclear whether mGlu7 receptors may activate presynaptic PLC and whether this action enhances glutamate release. Here we show, in a preparation of cerebrocortical nerve terminals, that mGlu7 receptors inhibit the release process, but can also potentiate it under specific conditions. Indeed, release potentiation is observed after a prolonged exposure of the receptor to agonist l-AP4. The new signaling elicited by the receptor involves PLC activation via a pertussis toxin (PTX)-insensitive G protein and the subsequent hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate. The mGlu7 receptor-dependent response potentiates release by a mechanism that could be dependent on the downstream release machinery because a parallel translocation of the active zone munc13-1 protein from the soluble to particulate fractions is observed upon receptor activation. The handling and all procedures to sacrifice the animals used in this study were performed in accordance to the European Commission guidelines (86/609/CEE) and approved by the Animal Research Committee at the Complutense University. Synaptosomes were purified on discontinuous Percoll gradients (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (5Millán C. Luján R. Shigemoto R. Sánchez-Prieto J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14092-14101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cerebral cortex was isolated from adult male Wistar rats (2–3 months old) and homogenized in medium containing 0.32 m sucrose (pH 7.4). The homogenate was centrifuged for 2 min at 2,000 × g and 4 °C, and the supernatant spun again at 9,500 × g for 12 min. From the pellets formed, the white loosely compacted layer containing the majority of the synaptosomes was gently resuspended in 8 ml of 0.32 m sucrose (pH 7.4). An aliquot of this synaptosomal suspension (2 ml) was placed onto a 3-ml Percoll discontinuous gradient containing: 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mmdl-dithiothreitol, and 3, 10, or 23% Percoll (pH 7.4). After centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the synaptosomes were recovered from the 10 and 23% Percoll bands, and they were diluted in a final volume of 30 ml of HEPES buffer medium (HBM): 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Following further centrifugation at 22,000 × g for 10 min, the synaptosome pellet was resuspended in 6 ml of HBM and the protein content was determined by the Biuret method. Finally, 1 mg of the synaptosomal suspension was diluted in 2 ml of HBM and spun at 3,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded and the pellets containing the synaptosomes were stored on ice. Under these conditions the synaptosomes remain fully viable for at least 4–6 h, as judged by the extent of KCl-evoked glutamate release. Glutamate release was assayed by on-line fluorimetry as described previously (5Millán C. Luján R. Shigemoto R. Sánchez-Prieto J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14092-14101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Synaptosomal pellets were resuspended in HBM (0.67 mg/ml) and preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence of 16 μm bovine serum albumin (BSA) to bind any free fatty acids released from synaptosomes during the preincubation (20Herrero I. Castro E. Miras-Portugal M.T. Sánchez-Prieto J. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 126: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A 1-ml aliquot was transferred to a stirred cuvette containing 1 mm NADP+, 50 units of glutamate dehydrogenase (Sigma), and 1.33 mm CaCl2 or 200 nm free Ca2+, and the fluorescence of NADPH was followed in a PerkinElmer LS-50 luminescence spectrometer at excitation and emission wavelengths of 340 and 460 nm, respectively. Traces were calibrated by the addition of 2 nmol of glutamate at the end of each assay. The data were obtained at 2-s intervals and corrected for Ca2+-independent release. Accordingly, the Ca2+-dependent release was calculated by subtracting the release obtained during a 5-min period of depolarization at 200 nm free [Ca2+] from the release at 1.33 mm CaCl2. The [Ca2+]c concentration was measured with fura2. Synaptosomes were resuspended in HBM (2 mg/ml) with 16 μm BSA in the presence of 1.3 mm CaCl2 and 5 μm fura2-acetoxymethyl ester (fura2-AM; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and incubated at 37 °C for 25 min. After fura2 loading, the synaptosomes were pelleted and resuspended in fresh HBM with BSA. A 1-ml aliquot was transferred to a stirred cuvette containing 1.3 mm CaCl2 and the fluorescence was monitored at 340 and 510 nm. Data points were taken at 0.5-s intervals and the [Ca2+]cyt, was calculated using the equations described previously (21Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). IP1 accumulation was determined using the IP-One kit (Cisbio, Bioassays, Bagnol sur-Cèze, France) (22Trinquet E. Fink M. Bazin H. Grillet F. Maurin F. Bourrier E. Ansanay H. Leroy C. Michaud A. Durroux T. Maurel D. Malhaire F. Goudet C. Pin J.P. Naval M. Hernout O. Chrétien F. Chapleur Y. Mathis G. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 358: 126-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Synaptosomes (0.67 mg/ml) in HBM with 16 μm BSA and adenosine deaminase (1.25 units/mg of protein) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After 25 min 50 mm LiCl was added to inhibit inositol monophosphatase and subsequently the agonist l-AP4 was added for 20 min prior to lysis. Other drugs were added as indicated in the figure legends. Synaptosomes were collected by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C and resuspended (1 mg/0.1 ml) in lysis buffer: 50 mm HEPES, 0.8 m potassium fluoride, 0.2% (w/v) BSA, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.0). The lysed synaptosomes were transferred to a 96-well assay plate and the homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) components were added: the europium cryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody, and the d2-labeled IP1 analogue were both diluted in lysis buffer. After incubating the assays for 1 h at room temperature, the europium cryptate fluorescence and the time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer signals were measured 50 μs after excitation at 337 at both 620 and 665 nm, respectively, using a RubyStar fluorimeter (BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany). The fluorescence intensities measured at 620 and 665 nm correspond to the total europium cryptate emission and the FRET signal, respectively. The specific FRET signal was calculated using the following equation: ΔF% = 100 × (Rpos − Rneg)/(Rneg), where Rpos is the fluorescence ratio (665/620 nm) calculated in the wells incubated with both donor- and acceptor-labeled antibodies, and Rneg is the same ratio for the negative control incubated only with the donor fluorophore-labeled antibody. The FRET signal (ΔF%), which is inversely proportional to the concentration of IP1 in the cells, was then transformed into the accumulated IP1 value using a calibration curve prepared on the same plate. cAMP accumulation was determined using a cAMP dynamic kit (Cisbio, Bioassays, Bagnol sur-Cèze, France). The assay was similar to that described for IP1 except that during incubation the cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro-20-1724 (0.1 mm) (Calbiochem, Damstard, Germany) was included for 35 min during incubation. The homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence assay was also similar to that described for IP1 except that an anti-cAMP antibody and d2-labeled cAMP analogue were used. The affinity purified guinea pig polyclonal antisera against mGlu4a, mGlu7a, and mGlu8a receptors used here have been described elsewhere (23Shigemoto R. Kinoshita A. Wada E. Nomura S. Ohishi H. Takada M. Flor P.J. Neki A. Abe T. Nakanishi S. Mizuno N. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7503-7522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The polyclonal rabbit antiserum against synaptophysin 1 was obtained from Synaptic Systems, Gottingen, Germany. As a control of the immunochemical reactions, primary antibodies were omitted from the staining procedure whereupon no immunoreactivity could be detected that resembled that obtained with the specific antibodies. The synaptosomes were allowed to attach to polylysine-coated coverslips for 1 h and then fixed for 5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Following several washes with 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), the synaptosomes were preincubated for 1 h in 10% normal goat serum diluted in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.9% NaCl (TBS) and 0.2% Triton X-100. Subsequently, they were then incubated for 24 h with the appropriate primary antiserum diluted in TBS with 1% normal goat serum and 0.2% Triton X-100:mGlu7a (1 μg/ml), mGlu4a (1 μg/ml), mGlu8a (1 μg/ml) receptors, or synaptophysin (1:100). After washing in TBS, the synaptosomes were incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in TBS for 2 h: a goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled to the Cy2 cyanine-derived fluorochrome Cy2 (diluted 1:200; Jackson, West Grove, PA) or a Cy3-coupled donkey anti-guinea pig antibody (diluted 1:400, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). After several washes in TBS, the coverslips were mounted with Prolong Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes) and the synaptosomes were viewed with a Nikon Diaphot microscope equipped with a ×100 objective, a mercury lamp light source, and fluorescein-rodamine Nikon filter sets. Synaptosomes were resuspended (0.67 mg/ml) in HMB medium with 16 μm BSA and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Adenosine deaminase (1.25 units/mg of protein) was then added for another 20 min, followed by l-AP4 1 mm for 10 min. Synaptosomes were washed by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 1 min) and resuspended (2 mg/ml) in hypo-osmotic medium (Tris-HCl buffer, 8.3 mm, pH 7.4) containing Protease Inhibitor Mixture Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). The synaptosomal suspension was passed through a 20-gauge syringe to disaggregate the synaptosomes and maintained at 4 °C for 30 min with gentle shaking. After this time the soluble and particulate fractions were separated by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (soluble fraction) was collected and the pellet (particulate fraction) was resuspended in RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Soluble and particulate fractions were used to assess enzymatic activity (acetylcholinesterase and lactic dehydrogenase, LDH) or for SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and Western blotting (Munc13-1; vGluT1 and Na,K-ATPase, β subunit). Acetylcholinesterase activity was determined fluorometrically by the Ellman's reaction in the presence of 0.75 mm acetylthiocholine iodide, 0.2 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8). LDH activity was assayed following NADH oxidation in medium containing 1 mm pyruvate, 0.2 mm NADH, 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in the presence of 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. Soluble and particulate fractions (3 μg of protein per lane) were diluted in Laemmli loading buffer with β-mercaptoethanol (5% v/v), resolved in SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide, Bio-Rad), and analyzed by Western blotting according to standard procedures. All samples were normalized to the levels of β-tubuline (soluble and particulate fractions) in the same blot as a loading control. Goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies coupled to Odyssey IRDye 680 or Odyssey IRDye 800 (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA) were used for quantitative Western blotting using the Odyssey System (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). The following primary antibodies were used to probe Western blots: polyclonal rabbit anti-Munc13-1 (1:1000), monoclonal mouse anti-Munc13-1 (1:200), polyclonal rabbit anti-vGluT1 serum (1:7000 Synaptic Systems, Germany), monoclonal mouse anti-β-tubulin (1.2000 Sigma), and polyclonal rabbit anti-Na,K-ATPase-β1-subunit (1:3500 Millipore, Molshein, France). The primary antibodies used for immunoprecipitations were a mouse monoclonal anti-munc13-1 (Synaptic Systems, Gottingem, Germany) or an affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antiserum against mGlu7a receptor (23Shigemoto R. Kinoshita A. Wada E. Nomura S. Ohishi H. Takada M. Flor P.J. Neki A. Abe T. Nakanishi S. Mizuno N. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7503-7522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG TrueBlotTM (1:1000; eBioscience, San Diego, CA). The proteins recovered were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 6.5% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a semi-dry transfer system, which were then probed with the antibody indicated and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce) and detected in a LAS-3000 (FujiFilm Life Science, Woodbridge, CT). P2 synaptosomes isolated from adult rats (Wistar) were homogenized using a VDI 12 homogenizer (VWR International, Barcelona, Spain) and solubilized for 30 min on ice in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA) for 30 min on ice. The solubilized preparation was then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min and the supernatant (2 mg/ml) was processed for immunoprecipitation, each step was conducted with constant rotation at 0–4 °C. The supernatant was incubated overnight with the antibody indicated and then 50 μl of a suspension of either protein A cross-linked to agarose beads (Sigma) or TrueBlot anti-rabbit Ig IP beads (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) was added and the mixture and incubated overnight. Subsequently, the beads were washed with ice-cold RIPA buffer that was removed with a 28-gauge needle. Then, 100 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.004% bromphenol blue) was added to each sample, and the immune complexes were dissociated by adding fresh dithiothreitol (50 mm final concentration) and heating to 90 °C for 10 min. Proteins were resolved and detected as described above. It is known that mGlu7 receptors inhibit synaptic transmission by decreasing evoked glutamate release and Ca2+ influx (5Millán C. Luján R. Shigemoto R. Sánchez-Prieto J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14092-14101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The cerebrocortical nerve terminal preparation from adult rats is enriched in this receptor, as witnessed by co-labeling with antisera against the vesicle marker synaptophysin and the l-AP4-sensitive mGlu receptors (4, 7, and 8) expressed in the brain. Indeed, among the nerve terminals that contained synaptophysin (1,148 particles from 7 fields), 30.0 ± 1.2% also contained mGlu7a receptor (mean ± S.E.; Fig. 1, A and D), whereas only 1.4 ± 0.5% contained mGluR4a (1,616 particles from 8 fields) and 1.6 ± 0.6% (989 particles from 8 fields) were immunoreactive for mGlu4a and mGlu8a receptors, respectively (Fig. 1, B–D). Thus the responses to l-AP4 are largely mediated by the mGlu7 receptor in this preparation. Depolarization of nerve terminals with KCl increases Ca2+ influx and glutamate release (5Millán C. Luján R.

In naive synaptosomes, the glutamate release evoked by 30 mm KCl (2.7 ± 0.1 nmol of Glu/mg of protein ± S.E., n = 6) fell to 66.7 ± 5% of control value in the presence of the group III mGlu receptor agonist, l-AP4 (n = 6, p < 0.001, Fig. 1, E and F). This response paralleled the reduction in depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx to 81.8 ± 1.2% of that in the controls (n = 8, p < 0.01, Fig. 1, G and H). However, there was no reduction in KCl-evoked release (97.0 ± 2% of control release) in synaptosomes that were exposed to l-AP4 (1 mm) for 10 min (n = 8, p > 0.05, Fig. 1, E and F). It is possible that the mGlu7 receptor undergoes activity-dependent internalization (19Pelkey K.A. Lavezzari G. Racca C. Roche K.W. McBain C.J. Neuron. 2005; 46: 89-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 24Pelkey K.A. Yuan X. Lavezzari G. Roche K.W. McBain C.J.

Neurosci. 2000; 3: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), leading to loss of the receptor response. However, this second agonist addition still decreased the Ca2+-influx in fura2-loaded synaptosomes (81.40 ± 1%, n = 8, p < 0.01, Fig. 1, G and H), indicating that the mGlu7 receptor remains at the surface and therefore that such receptor failure to reduce the evoked release is not due to receptor internalization. It is also possible that prolonged exposure to l-AP4 promotes a new response that augments release thereby counterbalancing the inhibition due to diminished Ca2+ influx. Because 30 mm KCl evokes maximal glutamate release, this stimulation condition establishes a ceiling above that no facilitation can be observed. Thus, we used lower KCl concentrations to make release facilitation possible. Glutamate release in naive synaptosomes stimulated with 5 mm KCl (0.9 ± 0.11 nmol, n = 6, Fig 1, I and J) was reduced to 45.8 ± 4% of the control value by the initial addition of l-AP4 (n = 6, p < 0.05). Interestingly, in nerve terminals previously exposed to l-AP4 the glutamate release evoked by 5 mm KCl was potentiated (165.8 ± 6.4% of control, n = 6, p < 0.01). Furthermore, a second addition of l-AP4 failed to inhibit the release of glutamate (90.5 ± 3.1% of control, n = 6, p > 0.05) and thus, exposure of synaptosomes to l-AP4 promoted a new response that augmented the release and counteracted its inhibition due to diminished Ca2+ influx. As release inhibition is mediated by impaired Ca2+ channel activity, release facilitation was separated from its inhibition by inducing release with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, which inserts into the membrane and delivers Ca2+ to the release machinery independently of Ca2+ channel activity (25Jovanovic J.N. Czernik A.J. Fienberg A.A. Greengard P. Sihra T.S. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). We first performed a time course to determine the time of l-AP4 pre-treatment needed to obtain optimal release potentiation. Although a remarkable increase in release was obtained after a 4-min incubation, maximal potentiation required 10 min of treatment with l-AP4 (1 mm) and this time was adopted as the standard (Fig. 2A). The ionomycin-induced release in naive synaptosomes was 0.65 ± 0.01 nmol of Glu/mg of protein (n = 26), and this ionomycin-induced release was increased to 1.1 ± 0.05 nmol of Glu/mg of protein in synaptosomes exposed to l-AP4 for 10 min (n = 26, p < 0.001, Fig. 2B). l-AP4-mediated potentiation was only observed at submaximal ionomycin concentrations of 2 to 6 μm (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the releasable vesicle pool disappeared at higher ionomycin concentrations. Thus, at 15 μm ionomycin no release potentiation was observed (99.9 ± 1.6%, n = 5, p > 0.05). We set out to characterize the l-AP4-mediated modulation of release pharmacologically. Release potentiation was prevented by the group III mGlu receptors antagonist (R,S)-α-cyclopropyl-4-phosphono-phenylglycine (CPPG, 100.4 ± 5.3% of control, n = 8, p > 0.05, Fig. 2D). Neither the mGluR5 antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine nor the mGluR1 antagonist 7-(hydroxyimino)cyclopropa[b]chromen-1a-carboxylate ethyl ester (CPCCOEt) altered l-AP4-mediated release facilitation (167.0 ± 6.2%, n = 4, p < 0.001 and 168.1 ± 1.5%, n = 4, p < 0.001, respectively). The group II mGluR antagonist LY-341495 was also without effect on the l-AP4-mediated facilitation (166.5 ± 3.4%, n = 4, p < 0.001). Pertussis toxin had no effect on release facilitation (163.5 ± 3.5%, n = 8, p < 0.001), indicating that Gi/Go proteins were not involved. In parallel experiments, PTX prevented inhibition of the release by the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen (32.2 ± 5.7%, n = 3, and 4.7 ± 3.1%, n = 3, of release inhibition), in the absence and presence of pertussis toxin, respectively. Thus, indicating the inactivation of the G protein by the toxin. Interestingly, the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U-73122 abolished this response (100.3 ± 0.9%, n = 7, p > 0.05), whereas its inactive analogue U-73343 had no such effect (164.1 ± 8.2%, n = 8, p < 0.001). Furthermore, neither the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), inhibitor H-89 (173.0 ± 3.1%, n = 8, p < 0.001), or the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor (SQ-22536) (168.5 ± 4.0%, n = 8, p < 0.001) altered release potentiation. We also tested whether release facilitation was sensitive to protein kinase C inhibitors and found that bisindolylmaleimide, the specific inhibitor of protein kinase C, which prevents ATP binding, did not affect the response (168.2 ± 4.3%, n = 6, p < 0.001). By contrast, calphostin C abolished l-AP4-mediated release potenti"

One potential group of archaeal ribonucleases are homologues of the bacterial RNase J family, which have a β-CASP metallo-β-lactamase fold.

Degradation of a 3′ end-labeled synthetic RNA in which an internal nucleoside is substituted by three ethylene glycol units generates intermediates demonstrating 5′ to 3′ directionality. The substitution of conserved residues in Pab-RNase J predicted to be involved in the coordination of metal ions demonstrates their importance for ribonuclease activity, although the detailed geometry of the catalytic site is likely to differ from bacterial RNase J.

The study of RNA metabolism in Archaea is in its infancy (for a recent review, see Ref. 1Evguenieva-Hackenberg E. Klug G. Prog. Mol. Biol. Transl. Sci. 2009; 85: 275-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The control of RNA processing and mRNA stability are important steps of gene expression. As in all domains of life, processing of tRNA in Archaea is performed by the ribonucleoprotein RNase P (2Frank D.N. Pace N.R. Annu. Rev.

The RNA-splicing endoribonuclease removes introns from archaeal pre-tRNA and participates in rRNA processing (5Li H. Trotta C.R. Abelson J.

Reeve J.N. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 893-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) suggests that mRNA degradation in the Archaea might be more closely related to processes in bacteria than in eukaryotes. To our knowledge, archaeal mRNA is not capped, nor have homologues of eukaryotic enzymes involved in mRNA capping, decapping, and 5′- to 3′-exoribonucleolytic degradation been identified in archaeal genomes (1Evguenieva-Hackenberg E. Klug G. Prog. Mol. Biol. Transl. Sci. 2009; 85: 275-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 8Brown J.W. Reeve J.N. J.

However, a eukaryotic-like exosome with a 3′- to 5′-exoribonucleolytic activity is present in most Archaea (10Koonin E.V. Wolf Y.I. Aravind L. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 240-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 11Lorentzen E. Walter P. Fribourg S. Evguenieva-Hackenberg E. Klug G. Conti E. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 5923-5931Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Overall, our comprehension of mRNA degradation in Archaea is very limited, whereas it is quite advanced in Eukarya and bacteria. In bacteria as well as in Eukarya, the nature of the 5′ end of mRNA is an important determinant for stability. In the model Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, RNase E, a key enzyme in mRNA degradation, is a 5′ end-dependent endoribonuclease (13Mackie G.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 720-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 14Bouvet P. Belasco J.G. Nature. 1992; 360: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Indeed substrates with 5′-monophosphate ends stimulate RNase E activity (15Jiang X. Belasco J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 9211-9216Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 16Callaghan A.J. Marcaida M.J. Stead J.A. McDowall K.J. Scott W.G. Luisi B.F.

In the model Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the recently identified and characterized RNase J was discovered in part due to efforts to identify an enzyme with RNase E-like activity (18Condon C. Putzer H. Luo D. Grunberg-Manago M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Zig L. Jamalli A. Putzer H. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2141-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Although the first work on RNase J demonstrated an endoribonuclease activity, subsequent work showed that RNase J also has an exoribonuclease activity with 5′ to 3′ directionality (19de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Zig L. Jamalli A. Putzer H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 21Mathy N. Bénard L. Pellegrini O. Daou R. Wen T. Condon C.

In vitro and in vivo evidence suggest that primary transcripts with a 5′-triphosphate end are protected from degradation by RNase J, whereas transcripts with 5′-monophophosphate or 5′-hydroxyl ends are readily degraded (19de la Sierra-Gallay I.L.

Unlike eukaryotes, where decapping and 5′ end-dependent mRNA degradation by Xrn1 appear to belong to a pathway recently elaborated in evolution (9Anantharaman V. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1427-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), studies with E. coli and B. subtilis, which are highly divergent species with truly ancient origins, suggest that at least two distinct pathways for 5′ end-dependent mRNA degradation have arisen in the prokaryotes. Putative archaeal proteins with sequence similarity to part of RNase E have been reported (25Lee K. Cohen S.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the only protein characterized to date, FAU-1 of the thermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus, has been shown to have RNA binding activity but not ribonuclease activity (26Kanai A. Oida H. Matsuura N. Doi H. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 253-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it has been suggested that most euryarchaeal genomes encode a protein related to B. subtilis RNase J (20Even S. Pellegrini O. Zig L. Labas V. Vinh J. Bréchemmier-Baey D. Putzer H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2141-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), which is a member of the β-CASP family of metallo-β-lactamases (27Callebaut I. Moshous D. Mornon J.P. de Villartay J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3592-3601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The β-CASP protein family includes enzymes with DNase and RNase activity (28Dominski Z. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 42: 67-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Based on sequence comparisons and structural studies, bacterial RNase J has three distinct domains corresponding to a metallo-β-lactamase domain, a β-CASP domain, and a C-terminal domain that is conserved among the bacterial homologues (19de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Zig L. Jamalli A. Putzer H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The structure of Thermus thermophilus RNase J with UMP bound shows a unique catalytic site formed by the metallo-β-lactamase and the β-CASP domains. These domains contribute contacts to the 5′-monophosphate of UMP in a structure reminiscent of the 5′ end-sensing pocket of RNase E (19de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Zig L. Jamalli A. Putzer H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although it seemed likely that the β-CASP proteins in the Euryarchaeota would have nucleolytic activity, until now their specificity and functionality were unknown. Here, we have biochemically characterized homologues of B. subtilis RNase J designated Pab-RNase J and TK-RNase J from the Thermococcale Pyrococcus abyssi and Thermococcus kodakaraensis Archaea, respectively. The corresponding His-tagged proteins expressed in E. coli possess a 5′- to 3′-exoribonucleolytic activity that is 5′ end-dependent. We have determined the importance of the conserved β-CASP key residues in this activity. Furthermore, our phylogenetic study provides evidence for an ancient evolutionary origin of the euryarchaeal RNase J. The archaeal phylogenetic tree was inferred from a concatenated dataset of 70 protein families. Each family included proteins encoded by genes conserved as single copy in all taxa (orthologous genes). A large majority of the families were composed of ribosomal proteins or tRNA synthetases. For each family, the sequences were aligned using Muscle (29Edgar R.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1792-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (30943) Google Scholar), and all gaps and ambiguously aligned regions were removed with Gblocks (30Castresana J. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2000; 17: 540-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (7493) Google Scholar). The 70 multiple alignments obtained were concatenated into a single large file of 10,855 aligned amino acid positions. The phylogenetic inferences were made with the maximum likelihood method using PHYML (31Guindon S. Gascuel O. Syst. Biol. 2003; 52: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (14296) Google Scholar). We used the JTT model of amino acid evolution with a gamma distribution fitted to the data by likelihood maximization (32Jones D.T. Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 275-282PubMed Google Scholar). The RNase J tree was computed with the same approach, and both trees were edited to highlight their congruence. The trees were arbitrarily rooted. Supplemental Table S1 summarizes all the mentioned oligonucleotides. The plasmid used for expression of His-tagged Pab-RNase J was pET15b. The coding sequence (PAB1751) was cloned as an XhoI-BamHI PCR fragment using the PAJ5XhO and PAJ3 oligonucleotides to give the plasmid pEJ9. The H86A, E209A, H388A, and H410A variants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of pEJ9 with the appropriate oligonucleotides and a QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Deletion of sequences corresponding to loops 1 and 2 were introduced into pEJ9 by reverse PCR with the appropriate oligonucleotides. The BL21-CodonPlus (DE3) E. coli strain carrying pEJ9 or plasmids bearing mutations was induced at an A600 of 0.6 by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated 3 h at 30 °C. A cell extract was heated to 70 °C for 10 min and clarified by low speed centrifugation. TALON Metal resin (Clontech) was used for immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography purification of the His-tagged protein. Protein (∼50 ng/μl) was dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol and stored at 4 °C after the addition of bovine serum albumin (0.2 mg/ml). The enzyme, analyzed by Coomassie-stained 12% SDS-PAGE, migrated at 50 kDa, in agreement with the predicted molecular mass of 50.5 kDa, and was judged greater than 95% pure by visual inspection. In vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase was performed as described by the manufacturer (Promega) using PCR fragments as templates. The leader mRNA ThrS, sR47, pre-tRNATrp, and tRNALeu templates were prepared as described (20Even S. Pellegrini O. Zig L. Labas V. Vinh J. Bréchemmier-Baey D. Putzer H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2141-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 33Nolivos S. Carpousis A.J. Clouet-d'Orval B.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6524-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The 21-RNA and 21#-RNA were synthesized by Dharmacon. RNA transcripts were treated with calf intestinal phosphatase to obtain dephosphorylated RNAs and subsequently treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase to obtain monophosphorylated RNAs. [α-32P]CTP was used to synthesize uniformly labeled transcripts. 5′ end-labeling with T4 polynucleotide kinase was performed on dephosphorylated RNA or synthetic RNA in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. 3′ end labeling was carried out with T4 RNA ligase in presence of 5′-[32P]pCp and DMSO. Circular RNA substrates were obtained by incubating 5′ end-labeled RNA with T4 RNA ligase. All labeled RNAs were purified on denaturing 8 or 10% PAGE. RNA circularization was verified by RNase T1 digestion (supplemental Fig. S3). Activity was assayed using labeled in vitro-transcribed RNAs or synthetic RNA in single turnover conditions with a 2–10-fold Pab-RNase J excess or in multiple turnover condition with a 20-fold excess of substrate. A typical enzyme excess reaction in a final volume of 20 μl contained 32P-RNA (5 fmol/μl), 10 or 50 nm wild type Pab-RNase J or variants, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol. In a substrate excess reaction, 20 pmol of nonradioactive RNA was added to the mixture. Reactions were started by the addition of the enzyme and incubated at 65 °C. Samples were withdrawn at the indicated times, and the reaction was stopped by adding formamide-containing dye supplemented with 10 mm EDTA or spotted directly on TLC plates (PEI-cellulose, Nagel). Reaction products in formamide dye mix were separated on denaturing (7 m urea) 8, 10, or 20% PAGE. TLC plates were developed with 0.25 m KH2PO4. All results were analyzed by autoradiography and quantified by phosphorimaging. Initial rates were determined by measuring the slope representing the percentage of substrate degraded during the linear phase of the reaction in at least three independent experiments. The migration positions of nonradioactive CMP and GMP (Fluka) were determined by UV shadowing on TLC plates; pCp was determined by autoradiography of 5′-[32P]pCp (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To identify RNase J homologues in the Archaea, we used the NCBI genome blast tool with the B. subtilis RNase J1 sequence (YkqC) as the query. A family of β-CASP proteins related to RNase J was detected throughout the Euryarchaeota except in the Archaeoglobales and the Thermoplasmatales. Protein sequence alignments of the bacterial and euryarchaeal proteins revealed a high degree of similarity, including all the signature motifs characteristic of the β-CASP proteins. The sequence alignment in Fig. 1, which is based on the comparison of the bacterial and euryarchaeal homologues available at the time of the analysis (supplemental Fig. S1), is an overview in which only three sequences are shown. YkqC is the RNase J1 of B. subtilis; PAB1751 and TK1469 are euryarchaeal homologues from P. abyssi and T. kodakaraensis, respectively. Motifs 1–4 correspond to conserved elements in the metallo-β-lactamase domain; Motifs A–C correspond to conserved elements in the β-CASP domain. The major characteristic feature of the euryarchaeal homologues is the lack of the region corresponding to the C-terminal domain of the bacterial homologues. Additional features consist of two short insertions labeled as Loop 1 and Loop 2 and a short deletion just upstream of motif B (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). The euryarchaeal homologues, which are on average about 100 residues shorter than their bacterial counterparts, due mainly to the absence of the C-terminal domain, are thus predicted to be canonical β-CASP proteins composed of a metallo-β-lactamase and a β-CASP domain, with no additional domains. The protein encoded by PAB1751 with an N-terminal His tag was expressed in E. coli and purified. A 64-nt 2The abbreviations used are: ntnucleotide(s)CPSFcleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor. RNA substrate corresponding to the P. abyssi sR47 box C/D guide RNA, whose structure and function has been well characterized (33Nolivos S. Carpousis A.J. Clouet-d'Orval B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6507-6514Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 35Clouet d'Orval B. Bortolin M.L. Gaspin C. Bachellerie J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4518-4529Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), was either body-labeled with [α-32P]CTP or 3′ end-labeled with [32P]pCp. These substrates, which were synthesized by transcription with T7 RNA polymerase, have a 5′-triphosphate end. The optimal growth temperature of P. abyssi is 103 °C (36Fukui T. Atomi H. Kanai T. Matsumi R. Fujiwara S. Imanaka T. Genome Res. 2005; 15: 352-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). However, the experiments presented here were carried out at 65 °C to avoid significant chemical (nonenzymatic) hydrolysis of RNA at a higher temperature. RNA degradation was analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2A, upper panel), and the fast-migrating products were identified as [α-32P]CMP or [32P]pCp by thin layer chromatography (Fig. 2A, lower panel). These results demonstrate that the product of PAB1751 is an exoribonuclease as the RNA substrate is degraded to mononucleotides. We, therefore, named this enzyme Pab-RNase J. Pilot studies in which the His tag on Pab-RNase J was removed showed that the tag did not affect ribonuclease activity (data not shown). The tagged version was used throughout the work reported here. We also expressed and purified the protein from T. kodakaraensis encoded by TK1469 and named this enzyme Tk-RNase J because its activity is similar if not identical to the activity of the Pab-RNase J (data not shown). In the following sections, we simplify the presentation by only showing the results with Pab-RNase J, although most of the experiments were performed with both enzymes and comparable results were obtained with Tk-RNase J. nucleotide(s) cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor. Careful visual inspection of the denaturing gels in Fig. 2A did not reveal the appearance of intermediates in degradation. Three other 5′-triphosphorylated substrates, known to adopt specific structures, were tested; that is, the 350-nt thrS leader mRNA, previously employed in studies of B. subtilis RNase J1 (19de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Zig L. Jamalli A. Putzer H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 20Even S. Pellegrini O. Zig L. Labas V. Vinh J. Bréchemmier-Baey D. Putzer H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4518-4529Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Results comparable with those with the sR47 substrate were obtained, although the degradation of the pre-tRNATrp (Fig. 2B) and tRNALeu substrates (data not shown) was slower than the degradation of the thrS leader mRNA and sR47. Throughout the experiments with 5′-triphosphorylated substrates, there was no indication of an endoribonuclease activity with either Pab-RNase J or Tk-RNase J. In particular, it has been demonstrated that highly purified RNase J1 of B. subtilis has endoribonuclease activity on 5′-triphosphorylated thrS leader mRNA (19de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Zig L. Jamalli A. Putzer H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the higher temperature used in these experiments destabilizes secondary structure in the thrS leader mRNA, necessary for endoribonuclease cleavage, even at temperatures as low as 45 °C, the only detectable activity of the archaeal homologues on the thrS leader mRNA was exoribonucleolytic. To test whether the phosphorylation state of the 5′ end of the RNA substrate affected Pab-RNase J activity, we synthesized several variants of sR47 and of pre-tRNATrp and measured their initial rates of degradation by Pab-RNase J. The sR47 substrate was labeled either at its 5′ end as a 5′-[32P]monophosphate or at its 3′ end by the addition of [32P]pCp. Two forms of the 3′ end-labeled substrate were prepared, 5′-hydroxyl and 5′-monophosphate. Two principal degradation products of the 3′ end-labeled substrates, [32P]pCp and [32P]CMP, were observed (Fig. 3A). Thus, pCp is converted to 5′-CMP in our assay. The overall analysis of our experimental results suggests that it is an activity of the Pab-RNase J itself and not due to a contaminating phosphatase. In particular, wild type Pab-RNase J can convert pCp to 5′-CMP, whereas variants that are inactive for exoribonuclease activity do not catalyze this reaction (data not shown). The principal product of the 5′ end-labeled RNA is [32P]GMP as guanosine is the 5′-nucleotide of sR47 (Fig. 3A). There are significant differences in the kinetics of degradation between a substrate with a 5′-triphosphate and the substrates with a 5′-hydroxyl or 5′-monophosphate (Fig. 4). The observed initial rate of degradation of the substrate with the 5′-triphosphate end is 5-fold slower than the substrate with the 5′-hydroxyl end or with the 5′-monophosphate end (Table 1). This is the lower limit of the difference as chemical hydrolysis of the 5′-triphosphorylated substrate contributes to its degradation. Thus, sR47 RNA with a 5′-triphosphate end is a poor substrate for Pab-RNase J (Fig. 2A). We observed a comparable Pab-RNase J preference for a 5′-hydroxyl or 5′-monophosphate end with the thrS leader mRNA (data not shown).TABLE 1Initial degradation rates of sR47 5′ and 3′ end-labeled variantsRNA substratesfmol of substrate degraded/min5′ppp-sR47p*Cp0.6 ± 0.25′p*-sR473 ± 1.55′p-sR47p*Cp2 ± 1.55′OH-sR47p*Cp3 ± 1 Open table in a new tab The pre-tRNATrp substrate is poorly degraded by Pab-RNase J independently of the nature of its 5′ end (Figs. 2B and 3B). The higher content of RNA secondary structure and the base pairing of the 5′ end in an RNA stem may account for the resistance of pre-tRNATrp to Pab-RNase J degradation. In the case of poor substrates such as pre-tRNATrp, the pCp is not significantly converted to 5′-CMP (Fig. 2B), possibly because the concentration of pCp produced in these reaction is significantly below the Kd for binding to the enzyme. In conclusion, the protective effects of the 5′-triphosphate and/or a 5′-stem suggest that the degradation reaction starts by binding to a 5′-single-stranded end and proceeds with an overall 5′ to 3′ directionality. It is important to note that the position of the labeled [32P]phosphorus (5′ or 3′) in the RNA substrate does not affect the initial rate of RNA degradation (Figs. 3A and 4). We further characterized the enzymatic properties of Pab-RNase J using 5′ end-labeled sR47 RNA. The enzymatic activity is highest between pH 6.5 and 8 (supplemental Fig. S2A). The addition of divalent ions to the reaction buffer did not stimulate the reaction, nor did the addition of EDTA inhibit the reaction. However, the activity was strongly reduced by the addition of 1,10-phenanthroline (20 mm), suggesting a requirement for tightly bound zinc ions. The Pab-RNase J activity increased with temperature up to 95 °C, the maximum temperature tested (supplemental Fig. S2B). We also tested if DNA was a substrate. Single-stranded DNA was degraded by Pab-RNase J (supplemental Fig. S2C), suggesting that the euryarchaeal RNase J homologues do not discriminate between ribose and 2′-deoxyribose nucleosides. Moreover, in line with the pre-tRNATrp results (Fig. 3B), where the 5′ end is embedded into a duplex structure, double-stranded DNA is resistant to Pab-RNase J degradation (data not shown). Further evidence for 5′ end-dependent exoribonuclease activity comes from experiments with circular RNA substrates. The 5′-[32P]monophosphorylated sR47 and 21-nt synthetic RNA (corresponding to the first 21 nucleotides of sR47) were treated with RNA ligase to obtain circular RNAs. Pab-RNase J degradation assays were performed on these substrates (Fig. 5). With the linear substrates, the reaction was complete after 20 min. In contrast, the circular substrates were highly resistant to Pab-RNase J. The trace amount of product detected after 20 min is likely due to the exonucleolytic degradation of circles nicked either by chemical hydrolysis or by a very weak Pab-RNase J endoribonuclease activity. That the gel-purified circular RNAs were digested with the endoribonuclease RNase T1 to confirm their topology (supplemental Fig. S3) argues against the hypothesis that circularization “collapses” the RNA into structures that are inherently nuclease-resistant. These results strongly support the conclusion that Pab-RNase J requires a free 5′ end to initiate degradation. The observation that Pab-RNase J degrades 5′-triphosphorylated RNA poorly (Fig. 3) suggests a 5′ to 3′ mode of degradation. If so, the release of the radiolabeled nucleotide will be the first step of the reaction with a 5′ end-labeled substrate and the last step with a 3′ end-labeled substrate. Therefore, degradation reactions with a 3′ end-labeled substrate would be expected to generate radiolabeled intermediates if the enzyme is distributive or has a slow progression on the substrate. However, we failed to detect degradation intermediates in a variety of experiments including limiting amounts of enzyme with 3′ end-labeled sR47, degradation of highly structured substrates such as pre-tRNATrp, analysis of products on high resolution sequencing gels, and reaction temperatures as low as 10 °C. Additional experiments in which we tried to block Pab-RNase J by the addition of an RNA binding protein (L7Ae, see Ref. 33Nolivos S. Carpousis A.J. Clouet-d'Orval B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6507-6514Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) failed to reveal degradation intermediates. 3B. Clouet-d'Orval, D. Rinaldi, Y. Quentin, and A. J. Carpousis, unpublished results. Therefore, RNA binding proteins and RNA secondary structure, which might be expected to block the progression of Pab-RNase J, have little effect under the conditions employed here. To obtain direct evidence for a 5′-3′ direction of hydrolysis, we blocked the progression of the enzyme artificially. We analyzed on high resolution polyacrylamide gels the products of degradation of a modified synthetic RNA corresponding to the first 21 nucleotides of sR47 RNA, which is interrupted by a spacer formed by three ethylene glycol units at position 9 in the sequence. This synthetic RNA oligonucleotide (referred to as 21#-RNA) was labeled either at its 5′ end as a 32P-5′-monophosphate or at its 3′ end by the addition of [32P]pCp. In parallel, a 21-nt synthetic RNA oligonucleotide (referred to as 21-RNA) with the same sequence but without the interruption was used as a control. This experiment was conducted in"

Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Packer L. Cadenas E. Biothiols in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 389-407Google Scholar). The functional importance of this system is underscored by the fact that GCS deficiencies are linked to nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH), a metabolic disorder with autosomal recessive inheritance characterized by a massive accumulation of glycine in body fluids, causing severe, frequently lethal, neurological symptoms in the neonatal period. The enzymatic analysis of NKH patients revealed that ∼85% have a P-protein deficiency, and the rest have a T-protein deficiency (2Tada K. Hayasaka K. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1987; 146: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have previously identified three mutations in human T-protein (huT) that caused NKH (3Nanao K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y.

Our crystal structure of huT revealed that five of nine disease-related missense mutations are localized around the folate cofactor, forming extensive hydrogen bond networks supporting the cofactor (4Okamura-Ikeda K.

On the other hand, some mutations are localized near the N terminus of the protein, which has been speculated to be involved in the protein-protein interaction with H-protein (5Okamura-Ikeda K.

The overall reaction catalyzed by GCS proceeds in three steps (Fig. 1). First, P-protein (glycine dehydrogenase; EC 1.4.4.2) decarboxylates glycine in a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent reaction, and the remaining aminomethyl moiety is passed onto the distal sulfur (S8) atom of the lipoate cofactor of H-protein. Second, T-protein (aminomethyltransferase; EC 2.1.2.10) degrades the aminomethyl moiety to ammonia and 5,10-CH2-THF in the presence of THF, leaving dihydrolipoate-bearing H-protein (Hred). Finally, L-protein (dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase; EC 1.8.1.4) catalyzes the reoxidation of the reduced lipoate cofactor in the presence of pyridine nucleotide. A unique feature of GCS is the fact that the H-protein, having a covalently attached R-(+)-lipoic acid, is engaged as a mobile substrate that commutes successively between the three enzymes. GCS also catalyzes the synthesis of glycine from 5,10-CH2-THF, ammonia and carbon dioxide in a reverse reaction (7Okamura-Ikeda K. Fujiwara K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol.

Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). On the other hand, T-protein has a cloverleaf-like structure consisting of three domains with a central folate-binding cavity (4Okamura-Ikeda K. Hosaka H. Yoshimura M. Yamashita E. Toma S.

The folate cofactor enters into the funnel-shaped cavity from the C-terminal wider opening and binds to the cavity in a kinked shape with the N5 and N10 atoms pointing to the N-terminal side at ∼13–14 Å in depth from the surface (see supplemental Fig. S6A). These structures raise the question how the aminomethyl lipoate arm leaves the binding cleft on H-protein and reaches the folate cofactor through the narrower opening of T-protein cavity. To gain insights into the structural basis of T-protein catalysis, we have determined the crystal structure of Escherichia coli T-protein (ecT) in complex with Hred from E. coli (ecHred) and 5-methytetrahydrofolate (5-CH3-THF), which mimics the ternary complex in the reverse reaction. The structure revealed for the first time how the H-protein-bound lipoyl group is inserted into the active site of the other GCS components. The present and previous structural information also provides detailed explanations for the NKH-causing mutations. Moreover, the distance between the tip of the dihydrolipoyllysine arm and the methylene carbon atom of modeled 5,10-CH2-THF predicts the presence of an intermediary that mediates the interaction of both reactants. Based on the structural observation and mutational analysis, we propose a reaction mechanism underlying the T-protein catalysis. We expressed and purified recombinant E. coli P-protein (ecP), H-protein (ecH), ecT, and ecT with C-terminal His6 tag (ecT-His6) as described previously (6Okamura-Ikeda K. Kameoka N. Fujiwara K.

Single-site mutations were introduced into ecT and ecT-His6 using pET3a/ET and pET23b/ET, respectively, as a template for PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis method with Pyrobest DNA polymerase (Takara). The second mutations were introduced into the constructs bearing one mutation in the same way. After the sequence verification, the expression plasmids were introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, and mutant proteins were expressed and purified following the procedure described for wild-type protein. Full lipoylation of recombinant ecH was verified by the altered migration on SDS-PAGE, in which lipoylated H-protein migrates faster than unlipoylated ecH (19Okamura-Ikeda K. Ohmura Y. Fujiwara K. Motokawa Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, a portion of the preparation was found to be the aminomethyllipoylated form (ecHint) by mass spectrometric analysis (data not shown). Therefore, ecH preparations were treated with ecT in the presence of THF to degrade ecHint contaminants. We then treated the ecH preparation with 15 mm tri(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (Fluka) to reduce the lipoate moiety. ecHint was prepared enzymatically. The reaction mixture (3 ml) containing 20 mm glycine, 14 mg of ecH, 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (KPB) (pH 7.0), 0.25 mm pyridoxal phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1.75 mg of ecP was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, and the resulting ecHint was purified by hydroxyapatite column chromatography (Bio-Rad). To prepare the ecHint sample used in its degradation assay, we employed [2-14C]glycine (18.5 GBq/mol) instead of nonlabeled glycine. Excess ecHred or ecHint was incubated with ecT or ecT mutants at 25 °C for 30 min in 20 mm 4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (pH 6.0) containing 2 mm DTT, and the complexes were isolated by gel-filtration chromatography on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 pg column (GE Healthcare). The complex-forming ability of the ecT mutants with ecH was also examined by gel-filtration chromatography. We obtained two types of crystals by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method at 15 °C by mixing the ecT·ecHred complex solution (22–25 mg ml−1) with an equal volume of different reservoir solutions. One was bipyramid-shaped crystals, which turned out to contain only ecHred monomer, grown in drops containing 0.095 m 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethanesulfonic acid (pH 7.5), 0.19 m calcium chloride, 26.6% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 400, and 5% (v/v) glycerol (Hampton Research) as the mother liquid. The crystals appeared after 4–5 days and reached a maximum size within 2 weeks. The other crystals containing ecT·ecHred complex were obtained in a drop containing 0.04 m potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 16% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, and 20% (v/v) glycerol (Hampton Research) as the mother liquid. The initial crystals, which assembled a rose, appeared after 2 weeks and were used for microseeding; the clustered crystals were grown to a maximum size in 3–5 days. The plate-like crystals separated from the cluster gave sufficient diffraction. The crystals were equilibrated in the mother liquid and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The complex crystals bound to 5-CH3-THF were prepared by soaking the native crystals in mother liquid containing 1 mm (6S)-5-CH3-THF (Scharcks Laboratory) at 15 °C for 4 h and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. We prepared the crystals of ecT mutant (ecTD97N) in complex with ecHint and soaked it in 5-CH3-THF solution in the same way as ecT·ecHred crystals. Diffraction datasets were collected at 100 K using the SPring-8 beamline BL44XU on an imaging plate detector DIP6040 (MAC Science/Bruker AXS) and processed using HKL2000 (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). We first solved the structure of ecHred by molecular replacement with MolRep (21Cowtan K. Newslett.

Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar) and model building in Coot (23Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). We then solved the structure of the ecT·ecHred complex by molecular replacement as above using the refined ecHred structure (PDB code 3AB9) and the structure of ecT (PDB code 1VLO) as search models. The structures of the ecT·ecHred complex bound to 5-CH3-THF and the ecTD97N·ecHint complex crystals soaked in 5-CH3-THF were also determined as above using the refined structure of ecT·ecHred as a search model. We prepared molecular graphic figures using PyMol. Supplemental Table S1 summarizes the diffraction and refinement data statistics. We determined the catalytic activity of ecT-His6 and its mutants in three different assays. Two of them are the glycine cleavage (forward) and synthesis (reverse) activities in the overall reaction system using limited amount of T-protein coupled with saturated amounts of ecH, ecP, and porcine L-protein (Roche Applied Science) in the presence of folate cofactors. Reactions were conducted according to the published protocol (5Okamura-Ikeda K. Fujiwara K. Motokawa Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 24Okamura-Ikeda K. Fujiwara K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 135-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The reaction mixture for the glycine cleavage reaction contained 10 mm [2-14C]glycine (7.4 GBq/mol), 50 mm KPB (pH 7.2), 0.1 mm pyridoxal phosphate, 0.8 mm THF, 1 mm NAD, 2 mm DTT, 900 pmol of ecH, 120 pmol of ecP, 56 pmol of L-protein, and varying amounts of ecT-His6 or its mutants (0.09–14 pmol) in 0.25 ml. The reaction was carried out for 10 min at 37 °C, and 14C-labeled one-carbon unit derived from glycine was trapped as a dimedone adduct and determined as described previously. The reaction mixture for the glycine synthesis contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 10 mm DTT, 0.25 mm pyridoxal phosphate, 1.2 mm 5,10-CH2-THF, 1.2 mm formaldehyde, 20 mm NH4Cl, 2 mm NADH, 20 mm NaH14CO3 (7.4 GBq/mol), 900 pmol of ecH, 120 pmol of ecP, 56 pmol of L-protein, and varying amounts of ecT-His6 or its mutants (0.44–28 pmol) in 0.25 ml. The reaction was carried out for 10 min at 37 °C, and the generated [1-14C]glycine was determined. The third method is the direct ecHint cleavage activity in the absence of THF. The reaction mixture contained 40 μm 14C-labeled ecHint, 50 mm KPB (pH 7.2), 1 mm DTT, and 3.5 μm ecT-His6 or its mutants in 0.25 ml. The reaction was carried out for 30 min at 37 °C, and released 14C-labeled one-carbon unit was determined as a dimedone adduct. The reaction proceeded linearly with time up to 30 min and with the concentration of ecT-His6. We collected T-protein (gcvT) homologues by database searches using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profiles. To construct HMM profiles, we collected known gcvT sequences stored in the KEGG GENES database (Release 51.0) (25Kanehisa M. Araki M. Goto S. Hattori M. Hirakawa M. Itoh M. Katayama T. Kawashima S. Okuda S. Tokimatsu T. Yamanishi Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D480-D484Crossref PubMed Scopus (4731) Google Scholar) as listed in supplemental Table S2, and these were subjected to multiple alignment with ClustalX 1.83. Four segments corresponding to the underlined ecT sequence in supplemental Fig. S3A were extracted from the multiple alignments and engaged as the training datasets for HMM profile construction using the HMMER package version 2.3.2 with default parameters. The four profiles obtained were subjected to database searches against KEGG GENES with HMMER. To extract gcvT homologues from the database search results, we collected sequences with E-values smaller than 10−10 against all four profiles and removed sequences too long or too short compared with known gcvT sequences. Finally, these sequences together with two additional sequences P49364 (from Pisum sativum (garden pea)) and Q9WY54 (from T. maritima), which are both stored in Swiss-Prot as known gcvT homologues, were again aligned with ClustalX 1.83. To crystallize ecT in complex with ecHred, an ecT·ecHred complex with an apparent mass of ∼57 kDa was isolated by gel-filtration chromatography and subjected to crystallization. Depending on the reservoir, crystals containing only the ecHred molecule and those containing the ecT·ecHred complex were obtained. The ecHred and ecT·ecHred structures were determined at 1.7 Å and 2.0 Å resolutions, respectively, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ecHred crystallized in space group P43212 containing one monomer in an asymmetric unit (supplemental Table S1). The overall structure of ecHred resembles that of peaH, which is 49.2% identical in sequence (supplemental Fig. S1A), showing a hybrid barrel-sandwich structure with the dihydrolipoyllysine arm situated at a hairpin β-motif between β6 and β7 (supplemental Fig. S1B). Structural alignments of the ecHred, two molecules of dihydrolipoate-bearing peaH in an asymmetric unit (PDB code 1DXM), and aminomethyllipoyllysine-bearing peaH (PDB code 1HTP) showed that the root mean square deviation of the Cα atoms ranged from 0.50 Å to 0.55 Å, whereas each lipoyllysine arm positioned differently, indicating its flexibility (supplemental Fig. S1C). The ecT·ecHred complex crystallized in space group P1 (supplemental Table S1). The crystals contained four ecT molecules (labeled molA–molD) and two ecHred molecules (molE and molF) in an asymmetric unit (supplemental Fig. S2A), forming two heterotrimeric complexes (molCAE and molDBF). Each heterotrimer consisted of an ecT·ecHred heterodimer (molAE and molBF) (Fig. 2A) and an additional ecT molecule (molC and molD). Two ecT molecules in the same heterotrimer were related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis with an interface between α4 and β8 (residues 117–140) of each molecule. There was no direct interaction between molC and molE or molD and molF. Because the ecT·ecHred complex eluted as a heterodimer (∼57 kDa) from gel-filtration chromatography, and the molecular mass in aqueous solution was confirmed by dynamic light scattering, crystal packing and the dimer-forming tendency of ecT may have led to such a complex crystal structure. Pairwise structural alignments between the four ecT molecules in the asymmetric unit showed that the root mean square deviation of the Cα atoms ranged from 0.11 Å to 0.32 Å, with an average value of 0.23 Å. Like T-proteins from other organisms, the ecT protomer consists of three domains arranged in a cloverleaf-like structure with a folate-binding central cavity (Fig. 2A). Minor conformational changes were observed in the backbone conformation of the three regions (regions 1–3) in domain 3 upon ecHred binding (supplemental Fig. S2B). Regions 1 and 2 contain residues contributing to the ecT·ecHred interface as described below. When the ecT·ecHred complex crystals were soaked in the 5-CH3-THF solution, they showed the clear Fo − Fc electron density for 5-CH3-THF in the central cavity of all ecT protomers (data not shown). The structures of two ecHred molecules in the asymmetric unit were nearly identical, giving a root mean square deviation of 0.30 Å between the 112 matched Cα atoms. ecHred binds to the boundary between domains 1 and 3 of ecT, forming an interface with the burial of ∼833.5 Å2 and 845.4 Å2 of exposed surface areas for molAE and molBF, respectively (Fig. 2A) (26Krissinel E. Henrick K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6929) Google Scholar). The interface is dominated by hydrogen bonds, which are buttressed by additional van der Waals contacts. Highly conserved residues in both proteins mediated these interactions (Fig. 2B and supplemental Figs. S1A and S3A), although some differences in hydrogen-bonding partners were observed between the two heterodimers (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S2C). A close examination of the interface of the molAE heterodimer revealed four hydrogen bond networks (Fig. 2C). At the center of the interface, the side chain of Arg292 of ecT forms three intermolecular hydrogen bonds to the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Ser62 and Val63 and to the side chain of Glu61 in ecHred. In the periphery, the side chain of Lys288 of ecT forms hydrogen bonds to the side chain of Asp43 and the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Val42 in ecHred. Furthermore, the side chain of Asp38 in ecHred is hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of Ser31 and the main-chain amide nitrogen of Ile33 in ecT, and the side chain of Arg16 in ecT to the side chain of Glu34 in ecHred. These hydrogen bonds are stabilized by a patch of van der Waals contacts between residues Gln32, Ile33, Lys288, Gly289, Val290, and Phe316 in ecT and residues Asp38, Val40, Phe41, Glu61, and Val63 in ecHred. The close proximity between Lys288 of ecT and Asp43 of ecH had already been shown in our previous experiment using a zero-length cross-linker (5Okamura-Ikeda K. Fujiwara K. Motokawa Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The extensive interactions around Arg292 seem to cause a shift of β7 and the hairpin β-motif in ecHred toward the interface (supplemental Fig. S2D). This structural change may force the release of the aminomethyllipoyllysine arm from the binding cleft of aminomethyllipoate-bearing H-protein. The residues in ecHred contributing to the interface correspond very well with those in peaH showing chemical shifts upon pea T-protein binding detected by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy (17Guilhaudis L. Simorre J.-P. Blackledge M. Marion D. Gans P. Neuburger M. Douce R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4259-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Arg292 is one of the residues strictly conserved among T-proteins from 136 organisms ranging from archaebacteria to mammals (supplemental Fig. S3), and its side chain was reoriented to the interface upon ecHred binding (supplemental Fig. S2C). To demonstrate the importance of Arg292 in the protein-protein interaction, we performed a mutational analysis of the residue. Although the behavior of the R292A mutant during expression and purification was similar to that of the wild-type protein, suggesting that the mutation did not affect the overall structure, the mutation abolished not only the glycine cleavage and synthesis activities but also the heterodimer-forming ability (Fig. 2, D and E). When a large amount of R292A was employed in the assay, enzyme activities were observed at trace levels, suggesting that the mutation impairs only the interaction with ecH but not the overall structure (Fig. 2D, inset). These results established the importance of Arg292 in the protein-protein interaction. In the complex structure, the dihydrolipoyllysine arm of ecHred is recruited to the active site pocket of ecT with the extending carbon atom chain along with the channel leading to the active site (Fig. 3A). The apparent but not strong omit Fo − Fc electron density for the arm was observed (supplemental Fig. S4A). The arm was coordinated by hydrogen bonds mediated by water molecules from the Nζ atom to Gln32 and Gly221 of ecT and from the S8 atom to Asn113 of ecT. The S8 atom also formed a hydrogen bond to the side chain of Arg223. Extensive van der Waals contacts between the carbon chain atoms and the residues Phe20, Leu27, Arg223, and Asp224 of ecT buttressed the conformation (supplemental Fig. S4B). Because the arm of the ecHred monomer is highly flexible (supplemental Fig. S1B), the arm can spontaneously bind to the active site pocket of ecT upon complex formation. The distances between the S8 atom of the dihydrolipoyllysine arm and the N5, N10, and 5-methyl carbon atoms of 5-CH3-THF were estimated to be 6.0 Å, 7.9 Å, and 4.6 Å, respectively, in the molAE structure (Fig. 3B). These unexpected long distances imply that the direct interaction between the S8 atom and the methylene group of 5,10-CH2-THF is improbable and that some intermediary should mediate the transfer of the methylene group of the folate to the S8 atom in the reverse reaction of T-protein catalysis. We built the structure of 5,10-CH2-THF based on the structure of 5-CH3-THF with Coot, energy-minimized using the Prodrg2 server, and aligned it on 5-CH3-THF in molAE structure (Fig. 3B). The distance between the S8 atom and the C11 atom of modeled 5,10-CH2-THF is estimated to be 6.4 Å, which is still too far for the direct interaction. Although the structure of tmT has been reported as a complex with free dihydrolipoate (11Lee H.H. Kim D.J. Ahn H.J. Ha J.Y. Suh S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50514-50523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the direct comparison with the present structure has little meaning; the lipoate derivative depicted in the study was an inactive S-(−)-lipoic acid enantiomer. On one side of the active site pocket, a hydrogen bond network is formed between the side chains of Tyr84, Asp96, Asp97, and Asn113 in ecT. Three water molecules (W868, W867, and W882) participate in further extension of the network. These water molecules are highly ordered and give clear Fo − Fc electron density (Fig. 3, C and D). This hydrogen bond network surrounds 5,10-CH2-THF placing the W868 molecule at a distance of 4.6 Å from the C11 atom of the folate (Fig. 3B). Based on this topology, we propose that the W868-binding site might represent the ammonium-binding site in the reverse reaction. Such an ammonium-binding site has been reported for NAD+ synthetase (27Rizzi M. Bolognesi M. Coda A. Structure. 1998; 6: 1129-1140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).

The protein presents structural similarity to hexameric molecular motors such as F1-ATPase, FtsK, or ring helicases, suggesting that TrwB also operates as a motor, using energy released from ATP hydrolysis to pump single-stranded DNA through its central channel.

These observations are discussed in terms of a possible role for TrwB in recognizing G-quadruplex structures as loading sites on the DNA. Bacterial plasmids are key players in bacterial evolution. Not only do they participate in the slow processes of speciation that shape bacterial genomes, but they also mediate the much more rapid and medically important processes of dissemination of antibiotic resistance and bacterial virulence (1de la Cruz F. Davies J. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 128-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Among the three classical mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer (conjugation, transformation, and transduction), conjugation is undoubtedly the most salient, at least in many human pathogens, from Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas to Gram-positive Enterococcus, to cite just three examples. Bacterial conjugative systems contain an essential integral membrane protein called the Type IV coupling protein (T4CP). This protein is involved in DNA transport, coupling the relaxosome (a DNA-protein complex) to the secretion channel (a multiprotein complex that spans the inner and outer membranes of the donor cell) (2Cabezón E.

The crystallographic structure of TrwBΔN70, the cytoplasmic domain of TrwB, reveals a hexamer with a six-fold symmetry and a central channel of about 20 Å in diameter (7Gomis-Rüth F.X. Moncalián G.

The structural similarity between TrwB and well known molecular motors, such as F1-ATPase (8Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar) or T7 gene 4 helicase (9Singleton M.R. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), suggests that TrwB also operates as a motor, using energy released from ATP hydrolysis to pump DNA through its central channel (10Cabezon E. de la Cruz F. Res. Microbiol. 2006; 157: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recent biochemical data indicated that TrwB ATPase activity can be activated by DNA and/or by protein TrwA, a tetrameric protein that binds specifically at the origin of transfer of the plasmid (oriT) and facilitates TrwB assembly on DNA (11Tato I. Matilla I. Arechaga I. Zunzunegui S. de la Cruz F. Cabezon E. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 25569-25576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The TrwA-TrwB system resembles other DNA-dependent molecular motors, such as the RuvA-RuvB recombination system, that target specific DNA structures for assembly as hexamers to pump DNA (12Yamada K. Miyata T. Tsuchiya D. Oyama T. Fujiwara Y. Ohnishi T. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Ariyoshi M. Mayanagi K. Morikawa K. Mol.

TrwBΔN70 ATPase activity is stimulated by both ssDNA 3The abbreviations used are: ssDNAsingle-stranded DNAdsDNAdouble-stranded DNAPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoridePipes1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. and dsDNA (11Tato I.

Although ATPase rates in the presence of dsDNA are comparable with ssDNA in vitro, the in vivo role for TrwB acting on dsDNA remains unclear because it is generally accepted that ssDNA is the translocated substrate during conjugation (13Cohen A. Fisher W.D. Curtiss 3rd, R. Adler H.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1968; 61: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 14Ohki M. Tomizawa J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

In an attempt to clarify the DNA substrate preference of TrwB and check the dependence of its ATPase activity on a particular DNA topology, we extended the analysis to oligonucleotides of different lengths, sequences, and conformations. This work indicated a preference for oligonucleotides with G-rich sequences and led us to explore the function of TrwB on G4 DNA in detail. single-stranded DNA double-stranded DNA phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. G4 DNA is a DNA secondary structure formed by the pairing of four guanines in a planar array and stabilized through Hoogsteen bonds (for a review, see Ref. 15Williamson J.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 703-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). G-quadruplex structural motifs are widespread in genomes and might be control elements in transcription, DNA replication, and other areas of DNA metabolism (16London T.B. Barber L.J. Mosedale G.

In these cases, G-DNA has to be dissociated by specific helicases. An example of this group of helicases is the RecQ helicase family (for a review, see Ref. 17Karow J.K. Wu L. Hickson I.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Members of this family have been found in organisms ranging from prokaryotes to mammals (RecQ in bacteria (18Irino N. Nakayama K. Nakayama H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 205: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), Sgs1 in yeast (19Stewart E. Chapman C.R. Al-Khodairy F. Carr A.M. Enoch T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2682-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), or BLM and WRN helicases in humans, responsible for Bloom and Werner syndromes, respectively (20Popuri V. Bachrati C.Z.

The function of these helicases is to unwind preferentially non-canonical DNA structures, such as Holliday junctions or G-quadruplex DNA. They maintain chromosome stability by resolving specific DNA structures that would otherwise impede the correct transmission of genetic information. In this work, we have found that G4 DNA stimulates ATPase activity of TrwBΔN70 and that the protein binds G4 DNA structures with higher affinity than ssDNA of the same sequence. Moreover, TrwBΔN70 only forms hexamers, the active oligomeric state of the protein, with G4 DNA. Our findings suggest a possible role of TrwB in dealing with high order DNA structures. The protein could either recognize a guanine-rich region of the plasmid to start DNA processing or, alternatively, it could be involved in resolving G4 secondary structures that arise during conjugative processing, a required step to assure the correct transfer of the plasmid. Purification of protein TrwBΔN70 was carried out as described previously (4Tato I. Zunzunegui S. de la Cruz F. Cabezon E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 8156-8161Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Protein samples were stored at −80 °C in buffer 50 mm Pipes-NaOH, pH 6.2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.001% PMSF. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of the BCATM protein assay kit (Pierce). PCR-amplified recQ from Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 was cloned into pET14b, creating pEB530, via NdeI and BamHI sites that were contained within PCR primers: recQ1, 5′-GGAATTCCATATGAATGTGGCGCAGGC, and recQ2, 5′-CGGGATCCCTACTCTTCGTCATCGCC. In each primer sequence, the restriction sites are underlined. N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged RecQ was expressed as a soluble protein from pEB530 in strain BL21 AI grown in ampicillin containing LB broth at 37 °C with induction by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm) and arabinose (0.2%) at an optical density of 0.5 for 2 h. Spun down cells were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm imidazole and 400 mm NaCl. This biomass was flash-frozen and thawed prior to sonication and centrifugation (20 krpm, 30 min) to obtain soluble RecQ protein, which was then passed into a precharged nickel His-Gravitrap column (GE Healthcare) under gravity. RecQ eluted from the column in 200 mm imidazole and was pure to about 90% homogeneity. RecQ protein was dialyzed into an alternative buffer for storage at −80 °C: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 40% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA. The concentration of RecQ (60.7 μm)) was calculated from assay with Bradford's reagent against bovine serum albumin calibration curve. Oligonucleotides were from Sigma-Aldrich. To prepare G4 DNA, the 45-mer oligonucleotide B (300 μm) was incubated overnight at 60 °C in buffer (50 mm Pipes, pH 6.2, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol and 100 mm sodium acetate). Then, the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 day and cooled down at room temperature for 2 h. Formation of the G-quadruplex was confirmed by gel filtration chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation. To prepare a forked DNA, 45-mer oligonucleotides E and F (85 μm each) were incubated at 95 °C for 3 min in buffer (50 mm Pipes, pH 6.2, 50 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol). Then, the mixture was cooled down at room temperature for 2 h. The same protocol was followed to prepare the duplex DNA substrate except that, in this case, oligonucleotides A and G were used. Formation of both substrates was confirmed by gel filtration chromatography. The DNA substrates prepared above were 5′-radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Fermentas) except that the G4 DNA sample contained 150 mm Na+ to stabilize the secondary structure. After labeling for 30 min at 37 °C, unincorporated nucleotides were removed by Micro Bio-SpinTM 6 chromatography columns (Bio-Rad). ATP hydrolysis was analyzed by a coupled enzyme assay as described previously (4Tato I. Zunzunegui S. de la Cruz F. Cabezon E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 8156-8161Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). TrwBΔN70 was preincubated with different DNA substrates for 10 min at 37 °C in 150 μl of an ATPase assay mixture consisting of 50 mm Pipes-NaOH, pH 6.2, 35 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgAc2, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.25 mm NADH, 60 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, and 60 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase (Roche Applied Science). Reactions were started by the addition of ATP. An Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman-Coulter) was used to perform the analytical ultracentrifugation experiments. The detection was carried out by means of a UV-visible absorbance detection system. Experiments were conducted at 20 °C using an AnTi50 eight-hole rotor and Epon-charcoal standard double sector centerpieces (12-mm optical path). Absorbance scans were taken at the appropriate wavelength (260–296 nm). Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 45 krpm using 400-μl samples in buffer consisting of 50 mm Pipes-NaOH, pH 6.2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 0.001% PMSF. Differential sedimentation coefficient distributions, c(s), were calculated by least squares boundary modeling of sedimentation velocity data using the program SEDFIT (21Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3045) Google Scholar, 22Schuck P. Perugini M.A. Gonzales N.R. Howlett G.J. Schubert D. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1096-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). From this analysis, the experimental sedimentation coefficients were corrected for solvent composition and temperature with the program SEDNTERP to obtain the corresponding standard s values. Solution viscosities were measured with an Anton Paar AMVn automated viscometer. Short column (85 μl) sedimentation equilibrium runs were carried out at multiple speeds (5.5, 8, 10, 12, and 17 krpm). After the equilibrium scans, a high speed centrifugation run (42 krpm) was done to estimate the corresponding baseline offsets. Weight-average buoyant molecular weights of protein and oligonucleotides were determined by fitting a single species model to the experimental data using either a MATLAB program based on the conservation of signal algorithm (23Minton A.P. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser, Boston, MA1994: 81-93Crossref Google Scholar) or the HeteroAnalysis program (24Cole J.L. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 384: 212-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Both analyses gave essentially the same results. The molecular weights of protein and DNA were determined from the experimental buoyant masses using 0.737 and 0.55 as the partial specific volumes of TrwBΔN70 (calculated from the amino acid composition using the SEDNTERP program) (25Laue T.M.

Methods Enzymol. 2000; 323: 231-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), respectively. DNA substrates and TrwBΔN70-DNA complexes were chromatographed at 20 °C at a flow rate of 30 μl/min on a Superdex-200 PC 3.2/30 column (Amersham Biosciences SMART system). The column was equilibrated in buffer containing 50 mm Pipes-NaOH, pH 6.2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.001% PMSF. Absorbance was monitored at 260 and 280 nm. To analyze the formation of DNA secondary structures, samples (40 μl) of the oligonucleotides were loaded at a concentration of 50 μm, previously diluted with gel filtration buffer. Formation of TrwBΔN70-DNA complexes was analyzed after incubating protein (60 μm) and DNA (10 μm) for 15 min at 20 °C. TrwBΔN70 DNA binding activity was measured using a gel shift assay. Binding reactions (20 μl) contained 50 mm Pipes-NaOH, pH 6.2, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 6% glycerol, 0.5 nm32P-labeled DNA, and the indicated quantities of TrwBΔN70. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 10% native PAGE gel (1× Tris-borate-EDTA). Free nucleic acids and nucleoprotein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis at 175 V for 2 h at room temperature. Gels were analyzed using a Molecular Imager FX ProSystem (Bio-Rad Laboratories). For quantification, the intensity of bands corresponding to free DNA and TrwBΔN70-DNA complex was determined using ImageQuant software. Free DNA (%) = free DNA/(free DNA + TrwB-DNA) × 100. DNA substrates were prepared and radiolabeled as described above. Helicase assays were carried out in 20 μl of a solution containing 50 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 6% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm magnesium chloride, 5 mm ATP, 32P-labeled DNA substrate (0.5 nm), and 50 mm Pipes, pH 6.2, for TrwB assays or 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for RecQ assays. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of 4 μl of Stop Mix (2.5% SDS, 200 mm EDTA, 10 mg/ml proteinase K) and 5 μl of loading buffer (0.5% bromphenol blue, 0.5% xylene cyanol, and 15% Ficoll). Products were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels (1× Tris-borate-EDTA) at 175 V for 90 min. Gels were analyzed using a Molecular Imager FX ProSystem (Bio-Rad Laboratories). In a previous work, we investigated the minimal length of ssDNA needed for activating TrwBΔN70 ATPase activity (4Tato I. Zunzunegui S. de la Cruz F. Cabezon E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 8156-8161Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). No activity was observed with oligonucleotides of <45 nucleotides and, therefore, we concluded that was the minimal length needed. However, a more extensive analysis with an enlarged series of oligonucleotides of different sizes and sequences has revealed a more complex picture. We observed that oligonucleotides that stimulated the ATPase activity of TrwBΔN70, independently of their size, systematically presented a second peak, as shown by gel filtration chromatography. Fig. 1 shows the elution profile of two different 45-mer oligonucleotides. The sequences of both oligonucleotides are shown in Table 1. Oligonucleotide A eluted as a single peak from a Superdex 200 column (peak 1), indicating the absence of any significant high order structure, whereas oligonucleotide B presented a second peak that eluted as if it were a higher molecular mass structure.TABLE 1Sequence of oligonucleotides used for the substrate preparationOligonucleotideSequence (5′–3′)AAAGGACGAAAACCTGTGTAGTGTTATGCCACTACAATATTGCCGCBTCGCCACGTTTCGCCGTTTGCGGGGGTTTCTGCGAGGAACTTTGGCAAAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGAADTCGCCACGTTTCGCCGTTTGCGAAGGTTTCTGCGAGGAACTTTGGEATCGATAGTCTCTAGACAGCATGTCCTAGCAAGCCAGAATTCGGCAGCGTFGACGCTGCCGAATTCTGGCTTGCTATGTAACTCTTTGCCCACGTTGACCCGGCGGCAATATTGTAGTGGCATAACACTACACAGGTTTTCGTCCTT Open table in a new tab In the absence of any DNA substrate, TrwBΔN70 showed basal ATPase activity at 24 nmol/min/mg of protein. Oligonucleotide A stimulated ATPase activity on TrwBΔN70 only marginally because fractions taken from the elution profile resulted in an activity of 46 nmol/min/mg (Fig. 1, right index). Oligonucleotide B led to a much enhanced TrwB ATPase activity, but only fractions from peak 2 were able to activate TrwBΔN70 ATP hydrolysis. The ATPase activity values obtained with samples from peaks 1 and 2 were 50 and 1150 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively, as shown in the histogram. Therefore, there is a correlation between the capability of an oligonucleotide to form a DNA structure and the stimulation of TrwBΔN70 ATPase activity. Such capability was independent of the size of the oligonucleotide because oligonucleotides shorter than 45-mer that were able to form a G4 DNA structure, such as oligonucleotide C (Table 1), also stimulated TrwBΔN70 ATPase activity (a value of 420 nmol/min/mg was obtained with the untreated oligonucleotide). Structural predictions using the program OligoCalc (27Kibbe W.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: W43-W46Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) showed that oligonucleotides A and B could potentially form the same intermolecular duplexes or hairpins, suggesting that a different type of DNA structure should be involved in promoting TrwBΔN70 ATPase activity (Fig. 1B, peak 2). Interestingly, oligonucleotide B presented a G-rich sequence that could lead to the formation of a G-DNA structure (28Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1990; 344: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). In vitro, oligonucleotides carrying G-rich sequences spontaneously form G4 DNA structures, influenced by the presence of monovalent cations (28Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1990; 344: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Therefore, laboratory stocks of G-rich synthetic oligonucleotides typically contain a small fraction of G4 DNA (29Sun H. Karow J.K. Hickson I.D. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27587-27592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). As mentioned, oligonucleotide B presents a track of five guanines that potentiate a G-quadruplex structure in vitro. To check this, oligonucleotide B was incubated for 48 h in a high salt buffer, following a protocol to obtain G4 DNA (30Baran N. Pucshansky L. Marco Y. Benjamin S. Manor H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (see also “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 2 shows the elution profile of oligonucleotide B in gel filtration experiments carried out before and after the treatment. Before the treatment, the oligonucleotide mainly eluted as peak 1, with only a small portion (17.6%) eluting as peak 2. After the treatment, most of the oligonucleotide (93.2%) eluted as peak 2, forming the secondary structure. Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out with oligonucleotide A and also with samples coming from peak 2 of pretreated oligonucleotide B. Both samples were monodisperse at the concentration tested (2.5 and 0.4 μm, respectively). The analysis of the sedimentation coefficient distributions yielded standard s values of 2.4 and 5.0 s (±0.1 s), which were compatible with a 45-mer oligonucleotide and a G4 DNA formed with a 45-mer oligonucleotide (calculated frictional ratios f/f0 = 1.7 and 2.1, respectively) (Fig. 3). Sedimentation equilibrium was carried out in parallel to determine the molecular weight of the molecules. A single species model accounted for the experimental gradients at sedimentation equilibrium of oligonucleotide A and pretreated oligonucleotide B, with best fit molecular weights of 14,100 and 51,400, compatible with a 45-mer monomer and a G4 DNA, respectively. Therefore, analytical ultracentrifugation experiments corroborated the formation of a G4 DNA structure in pretreated oligonucleotide B. Further analysis demonstrated that the track of five guanines that are present in oligonucleotide B was responsible for the formation of the G-quadruplex because substitution of two of these guanines, at positions 23–24, to adenines (oligonucleotide D, Table 1) disrupted the hydrogen bonding of the G-quartets and abolished the capability of oligonucleotide D to form a secondary structure. The elution profile of oligonucleotide D showed a single peak corresponding to peak 1, even after the treatment to stimulate the formation of a G-quadruplex structure. In addition, oligonucleotide D did not stimulate TrwBΔN70 ATPase activity. This important result linked TrwBΔN70 ATPase activity with the capability of an oligonucleotide to form a G-quadruplex DNA structure. Sedimentation velocity experiments were also carried out to compare TrwBΔN70 with TrwBΔN70-DNA complexes (Fig. 3). Analysis of the sedimentation coefficient distribution of TrwBΔN70 gave an s value of 3.3 (±0.1 s), compatible with a monomer of protein (calculated frictional ratio f/f0 = 1.4). The sample was monodisperse at the concentration tested (14 μm). The mixture of TrwBΔN70 and oligonucleotide A showed a biphasic sedimentation distribution. The predominant sedimenting species (87.3%) had an s value of 3.8 s, compatible with a 1:1 complex (calculated frictional ratio f/f0 = 1.7); the minor species with an s value in between those of isolated protein and oligonucleotide could correspond to dissociated species. The sedimentation coefficient distribution of the TrwBΔN70-G4DNA mixture showed two main sedimenting species, with s values 10.3 s (68.5%) and 9.0 s (26.6%), that are compatible with 6:1 and 4:1 complexes, respectively (calculated frictional ratios of f/f0 = 1.9 and 1.8; respectively). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were also carried out in parallel to determine the molecular weight of the macromolecules studied, but the protein-DNA complexes dissociated during the time length of the experiment, as demonstrated by time-dependent sedimentation assays. Therefore, it was not possible to use this technique to accurately determine the molecular weight and stoichiometry of the heterocomplexes. Gel filtration experiments were used as a second method to verify the formation of high order TrwBΔN70 oligomers when protein was incubated with pretreated oligonucleotide B. TrwBΔN70 is a monomer in solution, as shown by the elution of the protein as a single peak with an estimated molecular mass of 50 kDa from a Superdex 200 column (Fig. 4A, peak 1). Incubation of the protein with oligonucleotide A led to the formation of a complex that eluted with a molecular mass of ∼100 kDa (Fig. 4B, peak 2). The complex contained DNA, as shown by a correlated increase in the absorbance at 260 nm, so it was estimated to be a complex of one monomer protein with one oligonucleotide molecule (see also Ref. 4Tato I. Zunzunegui S. de la Cruz F. Cabezon E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 8156-8161Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Peak 1 corresponded to free protein because it showed a relative lack of absorbance at 260 nm. When TrwBΔN70 was incubated with pretreated oligonucleotide B (a G4 DNA structure), a new complex appeared (Fig. 4C, peak 3), with an estimated molecular mass of ∼400 kDa, also correlated with a high absorbance at 260 nm. Peak 3 corresponds to a hexameric TrwBΔN70-DNA complex, as suggested by the analytical ultracentrifugation experiments shown above and by electron microscopy experiments reported in a previous work (11Tato I. Matilla I. Arechaga I. Zunzunegui S. de la Cruz F. Cabezon E. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 25569-25576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and is consistent with the size of hexameric TrwBΔN70 complexes solved by crystallography (7Gomis-Rüth F.X. Moncalián G. Pérez-Luque R. González A. Cabezón E. de la Cruz F. Coll M. Nature. 2001; 409: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). When TrwBΔN70 was incubated with untreated oligonucleotide B, only a small fraction of TrwBΔN70 formed peak 3 (4Tato I. Zunzunegui S. de la Cruz F. Cabezon E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 8156-8161Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), corresponding to the small fraction of the oligonucleotide that spontaneously forms G4 DNA without pretreatment. Gel shift assays indicated that TrwBΔN70 binds to G4 DNA with high affinity, as shown in Fig. 5. The protein bound G4 DNA preferentially over ssDNA of the same sequence. Even at the lowest protein concentration, 1 nm, nearly all the G4 DNA substrate formed a complex with TrwBΔN70 (panel A). However, the same DNA sequence without any structure was shifted only at a TrwBΔN70 concentration above 10 nm (panel B), and only at 100 nm of protein, all the free oligonucleotide was forming a complex with TrwBΔN70. Therefore, we conclude that TrwBΔN70 displays preferential binding to G4 DNA (Kd = ∼0.3 nm) and has 100-fold lower affinity for the same ssDNA sequence without"
https://openalex.org/W2072432421,"After the radiation of eukaryotes, the NUO operon, controlling the transcription of the NADH dehydrogenase complex of the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS complex I), was broken down and genes encoding this protein complex were dispersed across the nuclear genome. Seven genes, however, were retained in the genome of the mitochondrion, the ancient symbiote of eukaryotes. This division, in combination with the three-fold increase in subunit number from bacteria (N = ∼14) to man (N = 45), renders the transcription regulation of OXPHOS complex I a challenge. Recently bioinformatics analysis of the promoter regions of all OXPHOS genes in mammals supported patterns of co-regulation, suggesting that natural selection favored a mechanism facilitating the transcriptional regulatory control of genes encoding subunits of these large protein complexes. Here, using real time PCR of mitochondrial (mtDNA)- and nuclear DNA (nDNA)-encoded transcripts in a panel of 13 different human tissues, we show that the expression pattern of OXPHOS complex I genes is regulated in several clusters. Firstly, all mtDNA-encoded complex I subunits (N = 7) share a similar expression pattern, distinct from all tested nDNA-encoded subunits (N = 10). Secondly, two sub-clusters of nDNA-encoded transcripts with significantly different expression patterns were observed. Thirdly, the expression patterns of two nDNA-encoded genes, NDUFA4 and NDUFA5, notably diverged from the rest of the nDNA-encoded subunits, suggesting a certain degree of tissue specificity. Finally, the expression pattern of the mtDNA-encoded ND4L gene diverged from the rest of the tested mtDNA-encoded transcripts that are regulated by the same promoter, consistent with post-transcriptional regulation. These findings suggest, for the first time, that the regulation of complex I subunits expression in humans is complex rather than reflecting global co-regulation."

Bone morphogenetic protein-7 (Bmp7) is required for kidney organogenesis. However, whether Gpr54 is involved in embryonic kidney development and how Bmp7 expression is regulated in the kidney are largely unknown. Here we report that Gpr54 deletion leads to kidney branching morphogenesis and glomerular development retardation in embryonic kidneys in vivo and in explanted kidneys in vitro. Gpr54 inactivation results in a high risk of low glomerular number in adult kidneys. Gpr54 is expressed in condensed mesenchyme at E12.5 and epithelial cells of proximal and distal tubules and collecting ducts at E17.5 and P0 mouse kidney. Deletion of Gpr54 decreases Bmp7 expression and Smad1 phosphorylation in the developing kidney. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays, we demonstrate that Gpr54 regulates NFAT2- and Sp1-mediated Bmp7 transcription. Furthermore, we show that NFAT2 cooperates with Sp1 to promote Bmp7 transcription activation. Together, these data suggest that Gpr54 regulates Bmp7 expression through NFAT2 and Sp1 and plays an important role in embryonic kidney branching morphogenesis and glomerular development."

https://openalex.org/W1978590580,"The proteasome homeostasis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is regulated by a negative feedback circuit in which the transcription factor Rpn4 induces the proteasome genes and is rapidly degraded by the assembled proteasome. The integrity of the Rpn4-proteasome feedback loop is critical for cell viability under stressed conditions. We have demonstrated that inhibition of Rpn4 degradation sensitizes cells to DNA damage, particularly in response to high doses of DNA damaging agents. The underlying mechanism, however, remains unclear.Using yeast genetics and biochemical approach we show that inhibition of Rpn4 degradation displays a synthetic growth defect with deletion of the MEC1 checkpoint gene and sensitizes several checkpoint mutants to DNA damage. In addition, inhibition of Rpn4 degradation leads to a defect in repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) by nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). The expression levels of several key NHEJ genes are downregulated and the recruitment of Yku70 to a DSB is reduced by inhibition of Rpn4 degradation. We find that Rpn4 and the proteasome are recruited to a DSB, suggesting their direct participation in NHEJ. Inhibition of Rpn4 degradation may result in a concomitant delay of release of Rpn4 and the proteasome from a DSB.This study provides the first evidence for the role of proteasomal degradation of Rpn4 in NHEJ."
https://openalex.org/W2081657670,"Background The natural history of HSV-2 infection and role of HSV-2 reactivations in HIV disease progression are unclear. Methods Clinical symptoms of active HSV-2 infection were used to classify 1,938 HIV/HSV-2 co-infected participants of the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) into groups of varying degree of HSV-2 clinical activity. Differences in plasma HIV RNA and CD4+ T cell counts between groups were explored longitudinally across three study visits and cross-sectionally at the last study visit. Results A dose dependent association between markers of HIV disease progression and degree of HSV-2 clinical activity was observed. In multivariate analyses after adjusting for baseline CD4+ T cell levels, active HSV-2 infection with frequent symptomatic reactivations was associated with 21% to 32% increase in the probability of detectable plasma HIV RNA (trend p = 0.004), an average of 0.27 to 0.29 log10 copies/ml higher plasma HIV RNA on a continuous scale (trend p<0.001) and 51 to 101 reduced CD4+ T cells/mm3 over time compared to asymptomatic HSV-2 infection (trend p<0.001). Conclusions HIV induced CD4+ T cell loss was associated with frequent symptomatic HSV-2 reactivations. However, effect of HSV-2 reactivations on HIV disease progression markers in this population was modest and appears to be dependent on the frequency and severity of reactivations. Further studies will be necessary to determine whether HSV-2 reactivations contribute to acceleration of HIV disease progression."
