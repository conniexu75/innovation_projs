https://openalex.org/W2063589950,Solid-state devices developed primarily for nuclear gamma spectroscopy have many potential uses in x-ray analysis.
https://openalex.org/W2061691476,"Extracts of the extrusible secretion-disseminating organs (""hairpencils"") of the male of the danaid butterfly, Lycorea ceres ceres, from Trinidad, contain a pyrrolizidine and two aliphatic esters. An odorous component, present in trace amounts, remains unidentified. Judging from the function of ""hairpencils"" in a related species, the secretion may play a mediating role in courtship."
https://openalex.org/W2025151682,"Kinetin (6-furfurylaminopurine) is generally considered to be relatively immobile within plants. Kinetin labeled with 14C was applied to the stumps of decapitated bean plants, with or without simultaneous application of indoleacetic acid. Significantly greater amounts of kinetin moved downwards in the stem in the presence of added indoleacetic acid than in its absence."

https://openalex.org/W2010660271,"We describe a porometer that enables continuous monitoring of the stomatal diffusive resistance of leaves. The flux is measured of a gas-such as nitrous oxide-diffusing through a leaf that divides an enclosing chamber into two compartments. Nitrous oxide is added in known concentration to the airstream passing through the compartment on one side of the leaf and is recovered from the airstream passing through the opposite compartment. From measurements of the difference in concentration across the leaf and of the flux, the diffusive resistance of the leaf to N(2)O is calculated; this value, adjusted for resistance external to the leaf, gives a continuous record of internal diffusive resistance. This record can be made simultaneously with measurements of transpiration and photosynthesis."

This novel molecule consists of two manganese complexes joined by an essentially linear Mn-O-Mn bridge. Its structure may have some relation to oxidation processes in biological systems."

https://openalex.org/W1994652206,The advantages of the fission method over conventional autoradiography for studying the distribution of uranium in natural minerals is described. Relatively high concentrations of uranium associated with micro inclusions in the St. Marks enstatite chondrite have been observed and may account for the variation of the uranium concentrations in different samples of this meteorite.
https://openalex.org/W2093013191,The gastric glands and vitellarium of Asplanchna are exceptions to the rule of constancy of the number of nuclei in rotifers. The two glands of a female may have different numbers of nuclei. Nuclear number in both organs varies widely among different individuals in a single culture. The mean nuclear number characteristic of a clone may be modified by dietary changes.

https://openalex.org/W1967472627,"Extraction with alkali of cell wall material from the seed of Melampyrum lineare leaves a residue (62.7 percent) which on hydrolysis yields over 70 percent mannose. Hydrolysis of the alkali-soluble hemicellulose fraction of the cell wall also yields largely mannose. In contrast, cell wall isolated from Melampyrum stem contains over 95 percent of glucose residues in the alkaliinsoluble fraction, and mostly xylose residues in the hemicellulose."
