https://openalex.org/W2345604850,"After upregulation of AHR in astrocytes by type I interferons, commensal-microbe-derived metabolites of dietary tryptophan act on astrocytes to suppress CNS inflammation. Astrocytes have important roles in the central nervous system (CNS) during health and disease. Through genome-wide analyses we detected a transcriptional response to type I interferons (IFN-Is) in astrocytes during experimental CNS autoimmunity and also in CNS lesions from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). IFN-I signaling in astrocytes reduces inflammation and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) disease scores via the ligand-activated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and the suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2). The anti-inflammatory effects of nasally administered interferon (IFN)-β are partly mediated by AHR. Dietary tryptophan is metabolized by the gut microbiota into AHR agonists that have an effect on astrocytes to limit CNS inflammation. EAE scores were increased following ampicillin treatment during the recovery phase, and CNS inflammation was reduced in antibiotic-treated mice by supplementation with the tryptophan metabolites indole, indoxyl-3-sulfate, indole-3-propionic acid and indole-3-aldehyde, or the bacterial enzyme tryptophanase. In individuals with MS, the circulating levels of AHR agonists were decreased. These findings suggest that IFN-Is produced in the CNS function in combination with metabolites derived from dietary tryptophan by the gut flora to activate AHR signaling in astrocytes and suppress CNS inflammation."

Here we reveal a relationship between gut microbiota and caspase recruitment domain family member 9 (CARD9), a susceptibility gene for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that functions in the immune response against microorganisms. CARD9 promotes recovery from colitis by promoting interleukin (IL)-22 production, and Card9(-/-) mice are more susceptible to colitis. The microbiota is altered in Card9(-/-) mice, and transfer of the microbiota from Card9(-/-) to wild-type, germ-free recipients increases their susceptibility to colitis. The microbiota from Card9(-/-) mice fails to metabolize tryptophan into metabolites that act as aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) ligands. Intestinal inflammation is attenuated after inoculation of mice with three Lactobacillus strains capable of metabolizing tryptophan or by treatment with an AHR agonist. Reduced production of AHR ligands is also observed in the microbiota from individuals with IBD, particularly in those with CARD9 risk alleles associated with IBD. Our findings reveal that host genes affect the composition and function of the gut microbiota, altering the production of microbial metabolites and intestinal inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2346025119,"To compare lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) and to identify new drivers of lung carcinogenesis, we examined the exome sequences and copy number profiles of 660 lung ADC and 484 lung SqCC tumor-normal pairs. Recurrent alterations in lung SqCCs were more similar to those of other squamous carcinomas than to alterations in lung ADCs. New significantly mutated genes included PPP3CA, DOT1L, and FTSJD1 in lung ADC, RASA1 in lung SqCC, and KLF5, EP300, and CREBBP in both tumor types. New amplification peaks encompassed MIR21 in lung ADC, MIR205 in lung SqCC, and MAPK1 in both. Lung ADCs lacking receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras-Raf pathway alterations had mutations in SOS1, VAV1, RASA1, and ARHGAP35. Regarding neoantigens, 47% of the lung ADC and 53% of the lung SqCC tumors had at least five predicted neoepitopes. Although targeted therapies for lung ADC and SqCC are largely distinct, immunotherapies may aid in treatment for both subtypes."

To explore these factors' contribution to skin microbial community stability, we generated metagenomic sequence data from longitudinal samples collected over months and years. Analyzing these samples using a multi-kingdom, reference-based approach, we found that despite the skin's exposure to the external environment, its bacterial, fungal, and viral communities were largely stable over time. Site, individuality, and phylogeny were all determinants of stability. Foot sites exhibited the most variability; individuals differed in stability; and transience was a particular characteristic of eukaryotic viruses, which showed little site-specificity in colonization. Strain and single-nucleotide variant-level analysis showed that individuals maintain, rather than reacquire, prevalent microbes from the environment. Longitudinal stability of skin microbial communities generates hypotheses about colonization resistance and empowers clinical studies exploring alterations observed in disease states."
https://openalex.org/W2345407464,"Sensing of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the cytosol triggers caspase-11 activation and is central to host defense against Gram-negative bacterial infections and to the pathogenesis of sepsis. Most Gram-negative bacteria that activate caspase-11, however, are not cytosolic, and the mechanism by which LPS from these bacteria gains access to caspase-11 in the cytosol remains elusive. Here, we identify outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) produced by Gram-negative bacteria as a vehicle that delivers LPS into the cytosol triggering caspase-11-dependent effector responses in vitro and in vivo. OMVs are internalized via endocytosis, and LPS is released into the cytosol from early endosomes. The use of hypovesiculating bacterial mutants, compromised in their ability to generate OMVs, reveals the importance of OMVs in mediating the cytosolic localization of LPS. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a critical role for OMVs in enabling the cytosolic entry of LPS and, consequently, caspase-11 activation during Gram-negative bacterial infections."

The ability to observe translation of single mRNA molecules in live cells provides a powerful tool to study translation regulation. Precise tuning of the expression of each gene in the genome is critical for many aspects of cell function. The level of gene expression is regulated at multiple distinct steps, including transcription, mRNA degradation, and translation (Schwanhäusser et al., 2011Schwanhäusser B. Busse D. Li N. Dittmar G.

Regulation of all of these steps in gene expression is important, though the relative contribution of each control mechanism varies for different biological processes (Brar et al., 2012Brar G.A.

Measuring the translation rate from individual mRNAs over time provides valuable information on the mechanisms of translation and translational regulation.

In contrast, a genome-wide snapshot of the translational efficiency of endogenous mRNAs in vivo can be obtained through the method of ribosomal profiling (Ingolia et al., 2009Ingolia N.T.

However, this method requires averaging of many cells and provides limited temporal information because of the requirement to lyse cells to make these measurements.

While ribosomal profiling and other recently developed methods have provided many important new insights into the regulation of translation, many questions cannot be addressed using current technologies. For example, it is unclear to what extent different mRNA molecules produced in a single cell from the same gene behave similarly. Many methods to study translation in vivo require averaging of many mRNAs, masking potential differences between individual mRNA molecules. Such differences could arise from differential post-transcriptional regulation, such as nucleotide modifications (Choi et al., 2016Choi J. Ieong K.W. Demirci H. Chen J. Petrov A. Prabhakar A.

Heterogeneity among mRNA molecules could have a profound impact on the total amount of polypeptide produced, as well as the localization of protein synthesis, but remains poorly studied. Furthermore, the extent to which translation of single mRNA molecules varies over time is also largely unknown. For example, translation may occur in bursts, rather than continuously (Tatavarty et al., 2012Tatavarty V. Ifrim M.F. Levin M. Korza G. Barbarese E. Yu J. Carson J.H. Single-molecule imaging of translational output from individual RNA granules in neurons.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 918-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, Yu et al., 2006Yu J. Xiao J. Ren X. Lao K. Xie X.S. Probing gene expression in live cells, one protein molecule at a time.Science. 2006; 311: 1600-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), and regulation of protein synthesis may occur by modulating burst size and/or frequency, which could occur either globally or on each mRNA molecule individually. In addition, the ability of an mRNA molecule to initiate translation may vary with time or spatial location, for example as cells progress through the cell cycle (Stumpf et al., 2013Stumpf C.R. Moreno M.V. Olshen A.B. Taylor B.S. Ruggero D. The translational landscape of the mammalian cell cycle.Mol.

Schuman E.M. The central dogma decentralized: new perspectives on RNA function and local translation in neurons.Neuron. 2013; 80: 648-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Such regulation could involve changes in the rates of translation initiation and/or the ribosome elongation. To address these questions, new methods are required for visualizing translation of single mRNA molecules in live cells over time. Here, we present a method, based on the SunTag fluorescence tagging system that we recently developed (Tanenbaum et al., 2014Tanenbaum M.E. Gilbert L.A. Qi L.S. Weissman J.S. Vale R.D. A protein-tagging system for signal amplification in gene expression and fluorescence imaging.Cell. 2014; 159: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar), for measuring the translation of single mRNA molecules over long periods of time. Using this system, we have measured initiation, elongation, and stalling on individual mRNA molecules and have uncovered unexpected heterogeneity among different mRNA molecules encoded by the same gene within a single cell. Our system will be widely applicable to the study of mRNA translation in live cells. Observing the synthesis of a genetically encoded fluorescent protein, such as GFP, in vivo is difficult because of the relatively long maturation time required to achieve a fluorescent state. Thus, a GFP-fusion protein typically will not fluoresce until after its translation is completed. To overcome this temporal challenge and to create a sufficiently bright signal to observe protein synthesis from single mRNAs in vivo, we used our recently developed SunTag system (Tanenbaum et al., 2014Tanenbaum M.E. Gilbert L.A. Qi L.S. Weissman J.S. Vale R.D. A protein-tagging system for signal amplification in gene expression and fluorescence imaging.Cell. 2014; 159: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). In this assay, cells are co-transfected with a reporter transcript containing an array of 24 SunTag peptides followed by a gene of interest, along with a second construct expressing a GFP-tagged single-chain intracellular antibody (scFv-GFP) that binds to the SunTag peptide with high affinity. As the SunTag peptides are translated and emerge from the ribosome exit tunnel, they are rapidly bound by the soluble and already fluorescent scFv-GFP (Figure 1A). Importantly, labeling of nascent chains using the SunTag antibody did not detectably alter protein synthesis rates of a reporter mRNA in human U2OS cells, as determined by FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) analysis (Figure 1B). At the same time, the mRNA was fluorescently labeled by introducing 24 copies of a short hairpin sequence into the 3′ UTR and co-expressing the PP7 bacteriophage coat protein (Chao et al., 2008Chao J.A. Patskovsky Y. Almo S.C. Singer R.H. Structural basis for the coevolution of a viral RNA-protein complex.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 103-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), which binds with high affinity to the hairpin sequence, fused to three copies of mCherry (PP7-mCherry) (Figure 1A). When observed by spinning disk confocal microscopy, the co-expression of a reporter construct (SunTag24x-Kif18b-PP724x, with Kif18b being a kinesin motor with a 2.5 kb coding sequence; Tanenbaum et al., 2011Tanenbaum M.E. Macurek L. van der Vaart B. Galli M. Akhmanova A. Medema R.H. A complex of Kif18b and MCAK promotes microtubule depolymerization and is negatively regulated by Aurora kinases.Curr. Biol. 2011; 21: 1356-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), scFv-GFP and PP7-mCherry, resulted in the appearance of a small number (10–50) of very bright green and red fluorescent spots per cell that co-migrated in time-lapse movies (Figure 1C; Movie S1). Spot tracking revealed that these spots diffused with a diffusion coefficient of 0.047 μm2/s, which is slightly slower than previous measurements of mRNA diffusion (0.1–0.4 μm2/s) (Katz et al., 2016Katz Z.B. English B.P. Lionnet T. Yoon Y.J. Monnier N. Ovryn B. Bathe M. Singer R.H. Mapping translation ‘hot-spots’ in live cells by tracking single molecules of mRNA and ribosomes.eLife. 2016; 5: e10415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with the fact that our reporter mRNA contains a larger open reading frame (4.4 kb versus 1.1 kb) and thus more associated ribosomes. In addition, we observed many dim GFP spots that did not co-migrate with an mCherry signal in time-lapse movies. The bright spots rapidly disappeared upon terminating translation by addition of a protein synthesis inhibitor, puromycin, which dissociates nascent polypeptides and ribosomes from mRNA (Figure 1C; Movie S2), indicating that they are sites of active translation where multiple ribosomes are engaged on a single mRNA molecule. The dim spots were unaffected by puromycin treatment, suggesting that they represent individual, fully synthesized SunTag24x-Kif18b proteins that had already been released from the ribosome. Thus, this translation imaging assay allows visualization of ongoing translation of single mRNA molecules. Rapid 3D diffusion of mRNAs makes it difficult to track single mRNAs for >1 min, as mRNAs continuously diffuse in and out of the z-plane of observation, and mRNAs regularly cross paths, complicating identification and tracking of individual mRNA molecules over time. To track mRNAs unambiguously for long periods of time, we added a CAAX sequence, a prenylation sequence that gets inserted into the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, to the PP7-mCherry protein that served to tether mRNAs to the 2D plane of the plasma membrane (Figures 1D and 1E). As a result of many PP7-mCherry molecules clustering through their interaction with the multiple recognition sites on a single mRNA, bright red dots appeared on the plasma membrane at the bottom of the cell, representing a tethered mRNA molecule (Figure 1E). Tethered mRNA molecules co-migrated with scFv-GFP foci, indicating that they are sites of active translation (Figure 1E; Movie S3). Membrane tethering of the mRNA had minimal effects on the protein expression of a GFP reporter construct as analyzed by FACS (Figure 1F). While membrane tethering greatly improves the ability to visualize translation on single mRNA molecules over long periods of time and does not appear to grossly perturb mRNA translation, it is important to note that some aspects of translation, especially localized translation, may be altered due to tethering (Discussion). We first analyzed the PP7-mCherry spots observed on the plasma membrane to confirm that they contained only a single mRNA molecule. The fluorescence intensities of PP7-mCherry foci were very homogeneous (Figure S1A). Their absolute intensity was ∼1.4-fold brighter, on average, than single, membrane-tethered SunTag24x-CAAX proteins bound with scFv-mCherry, which is expected to contain 24 mCherry molecules (Figure S1B). PP7 binds as a dimer to the RNA hairpin, and each PP7 was tagged with two tandem copies of mCherry. Thus, mRNAs’ spots could be expected to be four times as bright as single scFv-mCherry-SunTag24x-CAAX spots, but previous studies suggested that only about half of PP7 binding sites may be occupied (Wu et al., 2015Wu B. Buxbaum A.R. Katz Z.B. Yoon Y.J. Singer R.H. Quantifying Protein-mRNA Interactions in Single Live Cells.Cell. 2015; 162: 211-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); thus, mRNA spots would be about 2-fold brighter than single mCherry-SunTag24x spots if they contain a single mRNA molecule but ≥4-fold brighter if they contained two or more mRNAs. These results are therefore most consistent with the mCherry-PP7 foci being single mRNA molecules rather than multiple copies of mRNAs. Further supporting this idea, we tracked 63 single mRNA foci for 30–45 min and did not find a single case in which one spot split into two, which would have been indicative of more than one mRNA molecule being present in a single spot. Because single mRNAs were tethered to the plasma membrane through multiple PP7 molecules and thus through many CAAX membrane insertion domains, the 2D diffusion of mRNAs was extremely slow (1.06 × 10−3 μm2/s, n = 211 mRNAs). This slow diffusion made it possible to track individual mRNAs and their associated translation sites for extended periods of time (mean tracking time >1 hr) (Figure S1C). Furthermore, the very slow diffusion rate of tethered mRNAs allowed us to image tethered translation sites using long exposure times (500–1000 ms). During this time interval, rapidly diffusing, non-tethered fully synthesized polypeptides only produced a blurred, diffuse image on the camera sensor, which enabled sites of translation to be easily distinguished from fully synthesized molecules (Figure S1D). Finally, to confirm that the scFv-GFP was binding to nascent SunTag peptides, we replaced the SunTag epitope peptides in our reporter mRNA with an unrelated nucleotide sequence (encoding BFP) and found no GFP foci formation near mRNAs (Figure S1E). In conclusion, we have developed assays that enable both single mRNAs and their associated nascent translating polypeptides to be imaged over time. This general SunTag-based method can be performed with either freely diffusing mRNAs or mRNAs tethered to the plasma membrane, each of which has unique advantages depending on the specific biological question (Discussion). For further experiments in this study, we used the membrane-tethered system to follow translation for long periods of time. To estimate the number of ribosomes translating each mRNA, we compared the scFv-GFP fluorescence intensity of translation sites with that of the single, fully synthesized SunTag24x-Kif18b molecules present in the same cell (Figures S2A and S2B). Several considerations need to be taken into account to calculate ribosome number from the fluorescence intensities of translation sites and fully synthesized single SunTag proteins (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). First, ribosomes present at the 5′ end of the reporter transcript have translated only a subset of the 24 SunTag peptides, so the nascent polypeptide associated with these ribosomes will have lower fluorescence intensity due to fewer bound scFv-GFPs. We generated a mathematical model to correct for the difference in fluorescence intensity for ribosomes at different positions along the transcript (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Second, if scFv-GFP-peptide has a slow on rate for the epitope in vivo, a lag time could exist between the synthesis of a SunTag peptide and binding of a scFv-GFP, which could result in the underestimation of the number of ribosomes per mRNA. To test this, cells were treated with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX), which blocks ribosome elongation by locking ribosomes on the mRNA and prevents the synthesis of new SunTag peptides, while allowing binding of scFv-GFP to existing peptides to reach equilibrium. The translation site scFv-GFP signal did not substantially increase after CHX treatment (Figure S2C), indicating that under our experimental conditions, the lag time between peptide synthesis and scFv-GFP binding does not detectably affect translation-site intensity. Based on the above controls and our mathematical model, we could estimate the ribosome number per mRNA from the fluorescence intensity of the translation site. Approximately 30% of the mRNAs did not have a corresponding GFP signal, suggesting that they were not actively translating. For the remaining 70% of the mRNAs that were translating, the majority (76%) had between 10–25 ribosomes (Figure 2A; Supplemental Experimental Procedures), corresponding to an average inter-ribosome distance of ∼200–400 nucleotides (nt). We also compared translation-site intensity of two additional reporter mRNAs with either 5× or 10× SunTag peptides with the 24× peptide reporter. This analysis revealed that ribosome density was very similar on the 5× and 10× reporter (1.26-fold and 1-fold, respectively) (Figure S2D), indicating that the long 24× SunTag array does not grossly perturb ribosome loading on the reporter mRNA. Next, we measured the translocation speed of ribosomes on single mRNAs by treating cells with harringtonine, a small molecule inhibitor of translation that stalls new ribosomes at the start of the mRNA coding sequence without affecting ribosomes further downstream (Ingolia et al., 2011Ingolia N.T. Lareau L.F. Weissman J.S. Ribosome profiling of mouse embryonic stem cells reveals the complexity and dynamics of mammalian proteomes.Cell. 2011; 147: 789-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). As mRNA-bound ribosomes complete translation one-by-one after harringtonine treatment, the GFP signal on mRNAs decreases (Figures 2B–2D ; Movie S4). Using a simple mathematical model to fit the decay in fluorescence of a cumulative curve from many mRNAs (Figure S7; Supplemental Experimental Procedures), we estimate a ribosome translocation rate of 3.5 ± 1.1 codons/s. In a parallel approach, we also measured the total time required for runoff of all ribosomes from individual mRNAs (Figure S2E), from which we calculated a similar translation elongation rate (3.1 ± 0.14 codons/s) as the one obtained through our model (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). A reporter with only 5 instead of 24 SunTag peptides showed similar elongation kinetics (3.1 ± 0.4 codons/s) (Figure S2F), indicating that translocation rates are likely not affected by SunTag labeling of the nascent chain. Finally, we measured elongation rates of a shorter and codon-optimized reporter gene, which revealed a somewhat faster elongation rate of 4.9 codons/s (Figure S2G), indicating that elongation rates may differ on different transcripts. Using the elongation rate and ribosome density described above, we were able to estimate the translation initiation rate to be between 1.4–3.6 min−1 on the Kif18b reporter (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Together, these results provide the first in vivo measurements of the rates of ribosome initiation and translocation on single mRNA molecules in live cells. To study translation over time, we imaged cells for 2 hr and quantified the scFv-GFP signal from single mRNA molecules that could be tracked for >1 hr (Figures 3A, 3B , and S3A). The results show considerable fluctuations in the translational state of individual mRNAs over time (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A). Such large fluctuations were not observed when cells were treated with the translation inhibitor CHX (Figure S3B), indicating they were due to changes in translation initiation and/or elongation rather than measurement noise. We also observed heterogeneity of behavior between different mRNAs. Some remained in a high translating state for >1 hr (e.g., Figures S3A12 and 13). Others shut down translation initiation and lost their scFv-GFP signal (e.g., Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A1, 3–11, and 14), which may account for the population of non-translating mRNAs observed in steady-state measurements (Figure 2A). From the progressive decline in scFv-GFP fluorescence (Figure 3C; Movie S5), we could estimate a ribosome run-off rate of 3 codons/s (Figure 3C), which is similar to that measured after addition of harringtonine (3.5 ± 1.1 codons/s) (Figure 2). Interestingly, a subset (67 of 104 mRNAs, three independent experiments, 19 cells) of these mRNAs later reinitiated translation and largely recovered their original scFv-GFP fluorescence (Figures 3A, 3B, 3D, and S3A1, 3, 5, and 8–10). Individual mRNAs even showed repeated cycling between non-translating and translating states (Figure 3A, yellow line, and S3A3, 5 and 8). Such cycles of complete translational shutdo"

We characterized two new polyploidization events, both occurring after the divergence of carrot from members of the Asterales order, clarifying the evolutionary scenario before and after radiation of the two main asterid clades. Large- and small-scale lineage-specific duplications have contributed to the expansion of gene families, including those with roles in flowering time, defense response, flavor, and pigment accumulation. We identified a candidate gene, DCAR_032551, that conditions carotenoid accumulation (Y) in carrot taproot and is coexpressed with several isoprenoid biosynthetic genes. The primary mechanism regulating carotenoid accumulation in carrot taproot is not at the biosynthetic level. We hypothesize that DCAR_032551 regulates upstream photosystem development and functional processes, including photomorphogenesis and root de-etiolation."

Methods that allow real-time, high-resolution visualization of translation in live cells are essential for understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of translation regulation. Based on multivalent fluorescence amplification of the nascent polypeptide signal, we develop a method to image translation on individual mRNA molecules in real time in live cells, allowing direct visualization of translation events at the translation sites. Using this approach, we monitor transient changes of translation dynamics in responses to environmental stresses, capture distinct mobilities of individual polysomes in different subcellular compartments, and detect 3' UTR-dependent local translation and active transport of polysomes in dendrites of primary neurons."

We assessed how vaccine dosage, regimen, and route of administration affected durable protection in malaria-naive adults. After four intravenous immunizations with 2.7 × 10(5) PfSPZ, 6/11 (55%) vaccinated subjects remained without parasitemia following CHMI 21 weeks after immunization. Five non-parasitemic subjects from this dosage group underwent repeat CHMI at 59 weeks, and none developed parasitemia. Although Pf-specific serum antibody levels correlated with protection up to 21-25 weeks after immunization, antibody levels waned substantially by 59 weeks. Pf-specific T cell responses also declined in blood by 59 weeks. To determine whether T cell responses in blood reflected responses in liver, we vaccinated nonhuman primates with PfSPZ Vaccine. Pf-specific interferon-γ-producing CD8 T cells were present at ∼100-fold higher frequencies in liver than in blood. Our findings suggest that PfSPZ Vaccine conferred durable protection to malaria through long-lived tissue-resident T cells and that administration of higher doses may further enhance protection."

To better understand the relationship between ILC subsets and their Th cell counterparts, we measured genome-wide chromatin accessibility. We find that chromatin in proximity to effector genes is selectively accessible in ILCs prior to high-level transcription upon activation. Accessibility of these regions is acquired in a stepwise manner during development and changes little after in vitro or in vivo activation. Conversely, dramatic chromatin remodeling occurs in naive CD4(+) T cells during Th cell differentiation using a type-2-infection model. This alteration results in a substantial convergence of Th2 cells toward ILC2 regulomes. Our data indicate extensive sharing of regulatory circuitry across the innate and adaptive compartments of the immune system, in spite of their divergent developing pathways."

We demonstrate that maternal acquisition of these antibodies dampens mucosal T follicular helper responses and subsequent germinal center B cell responses following birth. This work reveals a feedback loop whereby T cell-independent, TLR-dependent antibodies limit mucosal adaptive immune responses to newly acquired commensal antigens and uncovers a broader function for maternal IgG."

Metabolic, endocrine, and behavioral functions are largely circadian and their disruption is associated with a number of disorders and pathologies, including cancer (Asher and Sassone-Corsi, 2015Asher G.

Circadian rhythms are governed by molecular machinery whose function is to maintain rhythmic precision within cells and synchrony between central and peripheral clocks. Importantly, circadian transcriptional circuits function in a defined tissue-specific manner by interplaying with specialized nuclear factors through poorly understood mechanisms (Masri and Sassone-Corsi, 2010Masri S.

Under standard physiological states, the core clock machinery is coupled to the metabolic cycles with which it operates in a coherent, concerted manner. However, the clock is also able to adapt to changing metabolic fluctuations as a compensatory mechanism and it does so by utilizing alternative transcriptional strategies. For instance, restricted feeding temporally phase shifts circadian gene expression in the liver (Damiola et al., 2000Damiola F. Le Minh N. Preitner N. Kornmann B. Fleury-Olela F. Schibler U.

Therefore, timing of food intake and nutritional challenge are able to uncouple the timekeeping of hepatic metabolic oscillations from the core clock machinery. Yet, aside from the consequences of nutritional challenge, the effects of other non-dietary factors that could uncouple and disrupt the hepatic clock remain largely unexplored. Cancer cells thrive based on a heightened metabolic rate that circumvents typical physiological means for energy production through the so-called Warburg effect (Hsu and Sabatini, 2008Hsu P.P.

In addition, cancer cells excrete a number of factors systemically, including metabolic “waste” byproducts and/or inflammatory signals (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A.

For example, tumor-secreted lactate, a product of increased aerobic glycolysis of cancer cells, is associated with heightened metastatic incidence and increased angiogenesis, is responsible for metabolic reprogramming in adjacent tissues, and can induce a pro-inflammatory state (Colegio et al., 2014Colegio O.R.

Similarly, the cooperative effects of the inflammatory response during tumorigenesis are well-documented (Gao et al., 2007Gao S.P. Mark K.G. Leslie K. Pao W. Motoi N. Gerald W.L. Travis W.D. Bornmann W. Veach D. Clarkson B. Bromberg J.F. Mutations in the EGFR kinase domain mediate STAT3 activation via IL-6 production in human lung adenocarcinomas.J. Clin.

Invest. 2007; 117: 3988-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Tumor-secreted cytokines, such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6), can regulate metabolism in multiple tissues (Mauer et al., 2015Mauer J. Denson J.L. Brüning J.C. Versatile functions for IL-6 in metabolism and cancer.Trends Immunol. 2015; 36: 92-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role in mediating tumor-induced metabolic changes systemically. Collectively, these tumor-derived metabolites and cytokines constitute the so-called tumor “macroenvironment” (Al-Zoughbi et al., 2014Al-Zoughbi W. Huang J. Paramasivan G.S. Till H. Pichler M. Guertl-Lackner B. Hoefler G. Tumor macroenvironment and metabolism.Semin. Oncol. 2014; 41: 281-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the systemic metabolic consequences of which remain elusive. Importantly, the effects of a tumor on organismal homeostasis are poorly understood, and given the unique ability of the clock in sensing metabolic discrepancies, a potential role of cancer in rewiring clock-controlled metabolism is intriguing (Sahar and Sassone-Corsi, 2009Sahar S. Sassone-Corsi P. Metabolism and cancer: the circadian clock connection.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 886-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Indeed, our results demonstrate that lung adenocarcinoma rewires the circadian hepatic transcriptome and corresponding metabolome, yet the core clock machinery remains virtually unperturbed. The tumor imposes a profound metabolic reprogramming that implicates a number of signaling pathways, which operate within the framework of the tumor macroenvironment. As a paradigm, we reveal that the inflammatory STAT3-Socs3 signaling axis is induced in the liver of lung-tumor-bearing mice, resulting in inhibition of hepatic insulin signaling, glucose intolerance, and deregulated lipid metabolism. In conclusion, we illustrate a previously unappreciated role played by a distally located lung adenocarcinoma as an endogenous circadian organizer (ECO) in the rewiring of circadian homeostasis of the liver. The KrasLSL−G12D;p53fl/fl mice are a genetic model of lung adenocarcinoma that mimics human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Jackson et al., 2005Jackson E.L. Olive K.P. Tuveson D.A. Bronson R.

Upon intra-tracheal delivery of equivalent adenoviral titer of Cre recombinase, which induces the genetic rearrangement of the Lox-stop-Lox cassette to activate oncogenic Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (Kras) and to knock out the tumor suppressor p53, mice developed defined lung adenocarcinoma (Figure S1). This mouse model generates lung adenocarcinoma with 100% penetrance and uniform tumor burden among all mice (Jackson et al., 2001Jackson E.L. Willis N. Mercer K. Bronson R.T. Crowley D. Montoya R.

Equivalent adenoviral titer of FlpO recombinase was administered to p53fl/fl littermates of the same pure C57BL/6J background as a control that does not induce recombination. Upon sacrifice, lung-tumor-bearing (TB) mice exhibited wild-type (WT) expression of Kras in the liver, white adipose tissue (WAT), and muscle, and no metastatic lesions were observed in the liver (Figure S2).Figure S2KRAS Expression and Liver Histology, Related to Experimental ProceduresShow full captionA) Representative images of WT and TB mouse lungs.B) White adipose tissue (WAT), muscle and livers from WT (p53fl/fl) and TB (KrasLSL−G12D;p53fl/fl) mice were genotyped for KRASLSL−G12D expression to confirm that Cre expression in TB mice was confined only to the lung.

To investigate the distal effects of lung adenocarcinoma on circadian hepatic function, WT and TB mice were sacrificed every 4 hr over the circadian cycle (zeitgeber time [ZT] 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20) and livers were subjected to transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses. Heat maps for oscillating genes based on transcriptomics, as determined by JTK_cycle, display striking differences in unique sets of oscillating genes from WT (left) and TB (right) mice (Figures 1A and 1B ). Gene ontology (GO) biological function was determined using DAVID pathway analysis for WT or TB oscillating genes. Pathway analysis revealed that WT-specific genes were enriched for a number of metabolic processes, including insulin response and regulation of cell cycle and proliferation, while TB-only oscillating genes were selectively enriched for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) signaling, unfolded protein response, cholesterol biosynthesis, and redox state (Figures 1C and S3). Phase analysis was performed for uniquely oscillating WT- and TB-specific genes to determine the relative phase of circadian gene expression. The peak in phase of expression was around ZT 8 in the WT category, whereas TB oscillating genes exhibited a bi-phasic profile that peaked around ZT 0 and again at ZT 12 (Figure 1D). Using the set of 505 genes that retain oscillation in both WT and TB mice, phase analysis was performed to determine if rhythmic genes retained their peak in expression. Strikingly, 46% of circadian genes exhibited a phase change, with 68% of these genes being phase advanced and 32% were phase delayed by at least 1 hr (Figure 1E). These results demonstrate that lung adenocarcinoma significantly reprograms the circadian hepatic transcriptome.Figure S3Redox-Related Genes and Metabolites in WT and TB Mice, Related to Figures 1 and 2Show full captionA) Gene expression profiles of Cyp51, Cyp3a25 and Fdft1 in WT and TB mice, were determined by real-time PCR.B) Abundance of NAD+ and NADH as determined by mass spectrometry in WT and TB mice.C) Abundance of oxidized and reduced glutathione in WT and TB mice over the circadian cycle.

Similar to the circadian transcriptome, metabolomics analysis revealed unique sets of oscillating metabolites in the livers of WT (left heat maps) or TB (right heat maps) mice (Figure 2A). Of ∼600 identified metabolites, two-way ANOVA analysis identified that 235 metabolites were differentially altered by the lung tumor and 328 metabolites were differentially expressed by time point (Figure 2B). Oscillating metabolites were further determined using JTK_cycle, and though the oscillation of 159 metabolites persisted, 90 were rhythmic exclusively in WT and 84 exclusively in TB mice (Figure 2B). Of these 159 metabolites that oscillate in WT and TB mice, 53% exhibited a change in phase, with 62% and 38% being phase advanced and delayed, respectively (Figure 2C). Classification of these metabolites into pathways demonstrated a clear reduction in oscillating lipids in TB versus WT mice (Figure 2D). In addition, a reduction in the levels of energetic metabolites NAD+, ATP and acetyl-CoA was seen (Figure 2E). This indicates altered usage or production of these molecules resulting in disruption of liver homeostasis in TB animals. Thus, the presence of lung tumors acts to distally rewire both transcriptional and metabolic programs in the liver. As further depicted below, this circadian reorganization appears to coordinately contribute to a TB-specific hepatic metabolic profile. A detailed analysis of the genes that were not altered between WT and TB mice was carried out, as shown in the heat map in Figure 3A. GO pathway analysis revealed this category is enriched in not only select metabolic genes, but also in rhythmic genes pertaining to the circadian clock (Figure 3B). The phosphorylation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear-translocator-like (ARNTL or BMAL1) protein and expression of all core clock genes, including circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (Clock), Bmal1, Period (Per1-3), Cryptochrome (Cry1/2) and nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D (Nr1d1 or Rev-Erbα), as well as the clock-controlled D site of albumin promoter binding protein (Dbp) gene, were unchanged in the livers of TB animals (Figures 3C and S4). In order to better characterize the effects of lung adenocarcinoma on the clock, locomotor behavior was analyzed, and no change in the free-running period was observed between WT and TB mice (Figure 3D). Similarly, behavioral actograms show that the circadian activity profile was equal during the light/dark cycles in WT and TB mice (Figure S4). Also, the feeding behavior remained rhythmic in TB mice while a non-significant decrease in food intake was observed (Figure 3E). The respiratory exchange ratio (RER) remained rhythmic, but TB mice displayed an elevated RER during the light phase and a dampened RER during the dark phase (Figure 3F), in keeping with a reduction in VO2, VCO2, and heat production (Figure S5). The altered circadian metabolites (Figures 2D and 2E) in conjunction with dampened RER levels (Figures 3F and S5) revealed a significant shift in the metabolic state of TB mice.

Given the changes in energy expenditure as measured by RER (Figure 3F) and the dampened lipid profiles identified by metabolomics in TB mice (Figure 2D), the effect of lung adenocarcinoma on fatty acid synthesis, breakdown by beta-oxidation, and utilization for cholesterol production were further investigated. The sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) pathway is known to control lipid metabolism in the liver in a circadian manner (Gilardi et al., 2014Gilardi F. Migliavacca E. Naldi A. Baruchet M. Canella D. Le Martelot G. Guex N. Desvergne B.

The SREBP pathway is known to be inhibited by the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Li et al., 2011Li Y. Xu S. Mihaylova M.M. Zheng B. Hou X. Jiang B. Park O. Luo Z. Lefai E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13255-13261Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Indeed, activation of AMPKα by phosphorylation of threonine (Thr) 172 was markedly elevated in TB mice and peaked at ZT 16 (Figure 4A). Given the dampened ATP levels in TB mice (Figure 2E), these effects are aligned with the increased intracellular AMP/ATP ratios over the circadian cycle (Figure 4A). Accordingly, the SREBP1 pathway was suppressed, as both gene expression profiles and the levels of the mature form of nuclear SREBP1c protein were repressed at ZT 16 in TB mice (Figure 4B). Similarly, significant inhibition of SREBP1 target genes was observed, as seen with Fasn, Acaca, and Elovl6 expression (Figure 4C). The repression of SREBP1-dependent signaling in the livers of TB mice was further substantiated by the decreased levels of long-chain fatty acids and esterified fatty acids (Figure 4D), including myristate, linolenate, palmitoleate, and eicosapentaenoate (EPA). This suggests either a decrease in fatty acid biosynthesis or an increase in breakdown by beta-oxidation, the former case being most likely given the suppression of SREBP1 signaling and the unaltered peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and beta-oxidation gene expression profiles in livers of TB mice (Figure S6).Figure S6Metabolic Gene Expression in Liver, WAT, and Muscle of WT and TB Mice, Related to Figure 4Show full captionA) Gene expression of beta-oxidation related genes in WT and TB mouse livers over the circadian cycle.

https://openalex.org/W2346372328,"The development and survival of all organisms depends on equal partitioning of their genomes during cell division. Accurate chromosome segregation requires selective stabilization of kinetochore-microtubule attachments that come under tension due to opposing pulling forces exerted on sister kinetochores by dynamic microtubule tips. Here, we show that the XMAP215 family member, Stu2, makes a major contribution to kinetochore-microtubule coupling. Stu2 and its human ortholog, ch-TOG, exhibit a conserved interaction with the Ndc80 kinetochore complex that strengthens its attachment to microtubule tips. Strikingly, Stu2 can either stabilize or destabilize kinetochore attachments, depending on the level of kinetochore tension and whether the microtubule tip is assembling or disassembling. These dichotomous effects of Stu2 are independent of its previously studied regulation of microtubule dynamics. Altogether, our results demonstrate how a kinetochore-associated factor can confer opposing, tension-dependent effects to selectively stabilize tension-bearing attachments, providing mechanistic insight into the basis for accuracy during chromosome segregation."

Although ILCs have been extensively studied in model organisms, little is known about these first responders in humans, especially their lineage and functional kinships to cytokine-secreting T helper (Th) cell counterparts. Here, we report gene regulatory circuitries for four human ILC-Th counterparts derived from mucosal environments, revealing that each ILC subset diverges as a distinct lineage from Th and circulating natural killer cells but shares circuitry devoted to functional polarization with their Th counterparts. Super-enhancers demarcate cohorts of cell-identity genes in each lineage, uncovering new modes of regulation for signature cytokines, new molecules that likely impart important functions to ILCs, and potential mechanisms for autoimmune disease SNP associations within ILC-Th subsets."
https://openalex.org/W2346533061,"Gastric carcinoma is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. This cancer, most of the time metastatic, is essentially treated by surgery associated with conventional chemotherapy, and has a poor prognosis. The existence of cancer stem cells (CSC) expressing CD44 and a high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity has recently been demonstrated in gastric carcinoma and has opened new perspectives to develop targeted therapy. In this study, we evaluated the effects of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) on CSCs in human gastric carcinoma. ATRA effects were evaluated on the proliferation and tumorigenic properties of gastric carcinoma cells from patient-derived tumors and cell lines in conventional 2D cultures, in 3D culture systems (tumorsphere assay) and in mouse xenograft models. ATRA inhibited both tumorspheres initiation and growth in vitro, which was associated with a cell-cycle arrest through the upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors and the downregulation of cell-cycle progression activators. More importantly, ATRA downregulated the expression of the CSC markers CD44 and ALDH as well as stemness genes such as Klf4 and Sox2 and induced differentiation of tumorspheres. Finally, 2 weeks of daily ATRA treatment were sufficient to inhibit gastric tumor progression in vivo, which was associated with a decrease in CD44, ALDH1, Ki67 and PCNA expression in the remaining tumor cells. Administration of ATRA appears to be a potent strategy to efficiently inhibit tumor growth and more importantly to target gastric CSCs in both intestinal and diffuse types of gastric carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2345565665,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the strongest identified risk factor for gastric cancer, the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. An H. pylori constituent that augments cancer risk is the strain-specific cag pathogenicity island, which encodes a type IV secretion system (T4SS) that translocates a pro-inflammatory and oncogenic protein, CagA, into epithelial cells. However, the majority of persons colonized with CagA+ H. pylori strains do not develop cancer, suggesting that other microbial effectors also have a role in carcinogenesis. Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is an endosome bound, innate immune receptor that detects and responds to hypo-methylated CpG DNA motifs that are most commonly found in microbial genomes. High-expression tlr9 polymorphisms have been linked to the development of premalignant lesions in the stomach. We now demonstrate that levels of H. pylori-mediated TLR9 activation and expression are directly related to gastric cancer risk in human populations. Mechanistically, we show for the first time that the H. pylori cancer-associated cag T4SS is required for TLR9 activation and that H. pylori DNA is actively translocated by the cag T4SS to engage this host receptor. Activation of TLR9 occurs through a contact-dependent mechanism between pathogen and host, and involves transfer of microbial DNA that is both protected as well as exposed during transport. These results indicate that TLR9 activation via the cag island may modify the risk for malignancy within the context of H. pylori infection and provide an important framework for future studies investigating the microbial-epithelial interface in gastric carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2346614284,"Microglial cells in the brain tumor microenvironment are associated with enhanced glioma malignancy. They persist in an immunosuppressive M2 state at the peritumoral site and promote the growth of gliomas. Here, we investigated the underlying factors contributing to the abolished immune surveillance. We show that brain tumors escape pro-inflammatory M1 conversion of microglia via CD74 activation through the secretion of the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), which results in a M2 shift of microglial cells. Interruption of this glioma–microglial interaction through an antibody-neutralizing approach or small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated inhibition prolongs survival time in glioma-implanted mice by reinstating the microglial pro-inflammatory M1 function. We show that MIF-CD74 signaling inhibits interferon (IFN)-γ secretion in microglia through phosphorylation of microglial ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2). The inhibition of MIF signaling or its receptor CD74 promotes IFN-γ release and amplifies tumor death either through pharmacological inhibition or through siRNA-mediated knockdown. The reinstated IFN-γ secretion leads both to direct inhibition of glioma growth as well as inducing a M2 to M1 shift in glioma-associated microglia. Our data reveal that interference with the MIF signaling pathway represents a viable therapeutic option for the restoration of IFN-γ-driven immune surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2346365634,"The clinical course in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is highly heterogeneous, with some patients having a slow progression and others an accelerated clinical and functional decline. This study aims to clinically characterize the type of progression in IPF and to investigate the pathological basis that might account for the observed differences in disease behavior. Clinical and functional data were analyzed in 73 IPF patients, followed long-time as candidates for lung transplantation. The forced vital capacity (FVC) change/year (< or ≥10% predicted) was used to define ""slow"" or ""rapid"" disease progression. Pathological abnormalities were quantified in the explanted lung of 41 out of 73 patients undergoing lung transplantation. At diagnosis, slow progressors (n = 48) showed longer duration of symptoms and lower FVC than rapid progressors (n = 25). Eleven slow and 3 rapid progressors developed an acute exacerbation (AE) during follow-up. Quantitative lung pathology showed a severe innate and adaptive inflammatory infiltrate in rapid progressors, markedly increased compared to slow progressors and similar to that observed in patients experiencing AE. The extent of inflammation was correlated with the yearly FVC decline (r = 0.52, p = 0.005). In conclusion an innate and adaptive inflammation appears to be a prominent feature in the lung of patients with IPF and could contribute to determining of the rate of disease progression."

Pop1/Pop6/Pop7 binding is specific and involves an RNA domain highly similar to a protein-binding domain in the RNAs of RNase P/MRP. The results also show that Pop1/Pop6/Pop7 function to maintain the essential components Est1 and Est2 on the RNA in vivo. Consistently, addition of Pop1 allows for telomerase activity reconstitution with wild-type telomerase RNA in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W2345470430,"ErbB-2 amplification/overexpression accounts for an aggressive breast cancer (BC) subtype (ErbB-2-positive). Enhanced ErbB-2 expression was also found in gastric cancer (GC) and has been correlated with poor clinical outcome. The ErbB-2-targeted therapies trastuzumab (TZ), a monoclonal antibody, and lapatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, have proved highly beneficial. However, resistance to such therapies remains a major clinical challenge. We here revealed a novel mechanism underlying the antiproliferative effects of both agents in ErbB-2-positive BC and GC. TZ and lapatinib ability to block extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT in sensitive cells inhibits c-Myc activation, which results in upregulation of miR-16. Forced expression of miR-16 inhibited in vitro proliferation in BC and GC cells, both sensitive and resistant to TZ and lapatinib, as well as in a preclinical BC model resistant to these agents. This reveals miR-16 role as tumor suppressor in ErbB-2-positive BC and GC. Using genome-wide expression studies and miRNA target prediction algorithms, we identified cyclin J and far upstream element-binding protein 1 (FUBP1) as novel miR-16 targets, which mediate miR-16 antiproliferative effects. Supporting the clinical relevance of our results, we found that high levels of miR-16 and low or null FUBP1 expression correlate with TZ response in ErbB-2-positive primary BCs. These findings highlight a potential role of miR-16 and FUBP1 as biomarkers of sensitivity to TZ therapy. Furthermore, we revealed miR-16 as an innovative therapeutic agent for TZ- and lapatinib-resistant ErbB-2-positive BC and GC."
https://openalex.org/W2346875448,"Radiotherapy is the standard therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC); however, radioresistance can hinder successful treatment. Here we report that microRNA (miR)-24 acts as a tumor suppressor and radiosensitizer in NPC cells and xenografts by targeting Jab1/CSN5. Although accumulating evidence has shown that Jab1/CSN5 functions as an oncoprotein in human cancers, its regulation through miRs has not been described. In this study, we found that Jab1/CSN5 functioned in a manner opposite to that of miR-24 in NPC tumorigenesis and radioresistance. We demonstrated that miR-24 inhibits Jab1/CSN5 translation via direct binding to its 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) and 5'UTR, leading to tumor growth inhibition, and sensitizes NPC tumors to radiation in vivo. Furthermore, silencing Jab1/CSN5 phenocopied the function of miR-24 in NPC cells after ionizing radiation treatment, resulting in increased apoptosis. Finally, we analyzed 50 paired samples of primary and matched recurrent NPC tissues from 25 NPC patients and subjected them to high-throughput genomic quantitative nuclease protection assay for quantifying simultaneously miR and mRNA levels. Our results showed that miR-24 levels were significantly decreased in recurrent NPC and that levels of Jab1/CSN5, as its target, were higher than those in primary NPC. Together, our findings indicate that miR-24 inhibits NPC tumor growth and increases NPC radiosensitivity by directly regulating Jab1/CSN5 and that both miR-24 and Jab1/CSN5 can serve as prognostic markers for NPC recurrence; this, in turn, may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for reversing NPC radioresistance."
https://openalex.org/W2346775209,"Notch receptors have been implicated as oncogenic drivers in several cancers, the most notable example being NOTCH1 in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). To characterize the role of activated NOTCH3 in cancer, we generated an antibody that detects the neo-epitope created upon gamma-secretase cleavage of NOTCH3 to release its intracellular domain (ICD3), and sequenced the negative regulatory region (NRR) and PEST (proline, glutamate, serine, threonine) domain coding regions of NOTCH3 in a panel of cell lines. We also characterize NOTCH3 tumor-associated mutations that result in activation of signaling and report new inhibitory antibodies. We determined the structural basis for receptor inhibition by obtaining the first co-crystal structure of a NOTCH3 antibody with the NRR protein and defined two distinct epitopes for NRR antibodies. The antibodies exhibit potent anti-leukemic activity in cell lines and tumor xenografts harboring NOTCH3 activating mutations. Screening of primary T-ALL samples reveals that 2 of 40 tumors examined show active NOTCH3 signaling. We also identified evidence of NOTCH3 activation in 12 of 24 patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models, 2 of which exhibit activation of NOTCH3 without activation of NOTCH1. Our studies provide additional insights into NOTCH3 activation and offer a path forward for identification of cancers that are likely to respond to therapy with NOTCH3 selective inhibitory antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2346220003,"Glypican-5 (GPC5) is a member of the heparin sulfate proteoglycans. Previous studies of GPC5 in lung tumorigenesis showed conflicting results. In this study, we confirmed that GPC5 was downregulated in lung adenocarcinoma tissues compared with adjacent normal lung tissues. The low expression of GPC5 was significantly associated with poor outcome in lung adenocarcinoma. To understand the biological mechanism of the downregulation, we examined the promoter methylation status of GPC5 gene. We found that GPC5 was significantly hypermethylated in lung cancer tissues and lung cancer cell lines compared with normal lung tissues. The methylation level of GPC5 was negatively correlated with its transcriptional expression. De-methylation experiments further confirmed that the loss of GPC5 expression was regulated by its hypermethylation. Overexpression of GPC5 inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of lung cancer cells in vitro, and repressed tumor growth in vivo, whereas knockdown of GPC5 was able to reverse the effect. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GPC5 could suppress the Wnt/β-catenin signaling by binding to Wnt3a at the cell surface, which mediated its function as a tumor suppressor. Overall, these findings demonstrate that GPC5 is a novel epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor, which inhibits tumor growth by suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling in lung adenocarcinoma. Our findings substantially expand our understanding about the role and the molecular mechanism of GPC5 in tumorigenesis of lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2345930858,"Targeting Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) by ibrutinib is an effective treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). However, both primary and acquired resistance to ibrutinib have developed in a significant number of these patients. A combinatory strategy targeting multiple oncogenic pathways is critical to enhance the efficacy of ibrutinib. Here, we focus on the BCL2 anti-apoptotic pathway. In a tissue microarray of 62 MCL samples, BCL2 expression positively correlated with BTK expression. Increased levels of BCL2 were shown to be due to a defect in protein degradation because of no or little expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXO10, as well as transcriptional upregulation through BTK-mediated canonical nuclear factor-κB activation. RNA-seq analysis confirmed that a set of anti-apoptotic genes (for example, BCL2, BCL-XL and DAD1) was downregulated by BTK short hairpin RNA. The downregulated genes also included those that are critical for B-cell growth and proliferation, such as BCL6, MYC, PIK3CA and BAFF-R. Targeting BCL2 by the specific inhibitor ABT-199 synergized with ibrutinib in inhibiting growth of both ibrutinib-sensitive and -resistant cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest co-targeting of BTK and BCL2 as a new therapeutic strategy in MCL, especially for patients with primary resistance to ibrutinib."
https://openalex.org/W2345764452,"Loss of HOXA5 expression occurs frequently in breast cancer and correlates with higher pathological grade and poorer disease outcome. However, how HOX proteins drive differentiation in mammalian cells is poorly understood. In this paper, we investigated cellular and molecular consequences of loss of HOXA5 in breast cancer, and the role played by retinoic acid in HOXA5 function. Analysis of global gene expression data from HOXA5-depleted MCF10A breast epithelial cells, followed by validation, pointed to a role for HOXA5 in maintaining several molecular traits typical of the epithelial lineage such as cell-cell adhesion, tight junctions and markers of differentiation. Depleting HOXA5 in immortalized MCF10A or transformed MCF10A-Kras cells reduced their CD24+/CD44lo population, enhanced self-renewal capacity and reduced expression of E-cadherin (CDH1) and CD24. In the case of MCF10A-Kras, HOXA5 loss increased branching and protrusive morphology in Matrigel, all features suggestive of epithelial to basal transition. Further, orthotopically implanted xenografts of MCF10A-Kras-scr grew as well-differentiated pseudo-luminal carcinomas, while MCF10A-Kras-shHOXA5 cells formed aggressive, poorly differentiated carcinomas. Conversely, ectopic expression of HOXA5 in aggressive SUM149 or SUM159 breast cancer cells reversed the cellular and molecular alterations observed in the HOXA5-depleted cells. Retinoic acid is a known upstream regulator of HOXA5 expression. HOXA5 depletion in MCF10A cells engineered to express doxycycline-induced shHOXA5 slowed transition of cells from a less differentiated CD24-/CD44+ to the more differentiated CD24+/CD44+ state. This transition was promoted by retinal treatment, which upregulated endogenous HOXA5 expression and caused re-expression of occludin and claudin-7 (CLDN7). Expression of CDH1 and CD24 was transcriptionally upregulated by direct binding of HOXA5 to their promoter sequences as demonstrated by luciferase and ChIP analyses. Thus, loss of HOXA5 in mammary cells leads to loss of epithelial traits, an increase in stemness and cell plasticity, and the acquisition of more aggressive phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2346358086,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) causes a range of skeletal problems, including reduced bone density and increased risk for bone fractures. However, mechanisms underlying skeletal complications in diabetes are still not well understood. We hypothesize that high glucose levels in T1D alters expression and function of purinergic receptors (P2Rs) and pannexin 1 (Panx1) channels, and thereby impairs ATP signaling that is essential for proper bone response to mechanical loading and maintenance of skeletal integrity. We first established a key role for P2X7 receptor-Panx1 in osteocyte mechanosignaling by showing that these proteins are co-expressed to provide a major pathway for flow-induced ATP release. To simulate in vitro the glucose levels to which bone cells are exposed in healthy vs. diabetic bones, we cultured osteoblast and osteocyte cell lines for 10 days in medium containing 5.5 or 25 mM glucose. High glucose effects on expression and function of P2Rs and Panx1 channels were determined by Western Blot analysis, quantification of Ca2+ responses to P2R agonists and oscillatory fluid shear stress (± 10 dyne/cm2), and measurement of flow-induced ATP release. Diabetic C57BL/6J-Ins2Akita mice were used to evaluate in vivo effects of high glucose on P2R and Panx1. Western blotting indicated altered P2X7R, P2Y2R and P2Y4R expression in high glucose exposed bone cells, and in diabetic bone tissue. Moreover, high glucose blunted normal P2R- and flow-induced Ca2+ signaling and ATP release from osteocytes. These findings indicate that T1D impairs load-induced ATP signaling in osteocytes and affects osteoblast function, which are essential for maintaining bone health."
https://openalex.org/W2346540202,"Amplification and overexpression of erbB2/neu proto-oncogene is observed in 20-30% human breast cancer and is inversely correlated with the survival of the patient. Despite this, somatic activating mutations within erbB2 in human breast cancers are rare. However, we have previously reported that a splice isoform of erbB2, containing an in-frame deletion of exon 16 (herein referred to as ErbB2ΔEx16), results in oncogenic activation of erbB2 because of constitutive dimerization of the ErbB2 receptor. Here, we demonstrate that the ErbB2ΔEx16 is a major oncogenic driver in breast cancer that constitutively signals from the cell surface. We further show that inducible expression of the ErbB2ΔEx16 variant in mammary gland of transgenic mice results in the rapid development of metastatic multifocal mammary tumors. Genetic and biochemical characterization of the ErbB2ΔEx16-derived mammary tumors exhibit several unique features that distinguish this model from the conventional ErbB2 ones expressing the erbB2 proto-oncogene in mammary epithelium. Unlike the wild-type ErbB2-derived tumors that express luminal keratins, ErbB2ΔEx16-derived tumors exhibit high degree of intratumoral heterogeneity co-expressing both basal and luminal keratins. Consistent with these distinct pathological features, the ErbB2ΔEx16 tumors exhibit distinct signaling and gene expression profiles that correlate with activation of number of key transcription factors implicated in breast cancer metastasis and cancer stem cell renewal."
https://openalex.org/W2345683698,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease posing a challenge for accurate classification and treatment of this malignancy. There is no common genetic molecular feature that would allow for the identification of patients at risk for developing recurrences and thus selecting patients who would benefit from more stringent therapies still poses a major clinical challenge. Recently, an international multicenter consortium (CRC Subtyping Consortium) was established aiming at the classification of CRC patients in biologically homogeneous CRC subtypes. Four consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) were identified, of which the mesenchymal CMS4 presented with worse prognosis signifying the importance of identifying these patients. Despite the large number of samples analyzed and their clear association with unifying biological programs and clinical features, single-driver mutations could not be identified and patients are heterogeneous with regard to currently used clinical markers. We therefore set out to define the regulatory mechanisms underlying the distinct gene expression profiles using a network-based approach involving multiple molecular modalities such as gene expression, methylation levels and microRNA (miR) expression. The miR-200 family presented as the most powerful determinant of CMS4-specific gene expression, tuning the majority of genes differentially expressed in the poor prognosis subtype, including genes associated with the epithelial–mesenchymal transition program. Furthermore, our data show that two epigenetic marks, namely the methylation of the two miR-200 promoter regions, can identify tumors belonging to the mesenchymal subtype and is predictive of disease-free survival in CRC patients. Importantly, epigenetic silencing of the miR-200 family is also detected in epithelial CRC cell lines that belong to the mesenchymal CMS. We thus show that determining regulatory networks is a powerful strategy to define drivers of distinct cancer subtypes, which possess the ability to identify subtype affiliation and to shed light on biological behavior."

Plants were exposed to different degrees of drought and then maintained at that level for five days. Responses were examined in terms of metabolic changes and the expression of drought induced proteins-Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) and dehydrins (DHNs). Generalised phenotypic changes were studied using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopy and non-targeted Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) was employed to detect changes in metabolites, while changes in protein expression were examined using Western blot analysis. Different response profiles of metabolites, HSPs and DHNs were observed in the two cultivars. Metabolic changes involved variation in amino acids, polysaccharides and their derivatives. A total of 188 compounds, with 142 known metabolites and 46 unknown small molecules, were detected in the two sorghum varieties. Under water deficit conditions, Samsorg 17 accumulated sugars and sugar alcohols, while in Samsorg 40 amino acids increased in concentration. This study suggest that the two Sorghum varieties adopt distinct approaches in response to drought, with Samsorg 17 being better able to maintain leaf function under severe drought conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2346763629,"We defined Systemic inflammation (SI) as a “typical, multi-syndrome, phase-specific pathological process, developing from systemic damage and characterized by the total inflammatory reactivity of endotheliocytes, plasma and blood cell factors, connective tissue and, at the final stage, by microcirculatory disorders in vital organs and tissues.” The goal of the work: to determine methodological approaches and particular methodical solutions for the problem of identification of SI as a common pathological process. SI can be defined by the presence in plasma of systemic proinflammatory cell stress products—cytokines and other inflammatory mediators, and also by the complexity of other processes signs. We have developed 2 scales: 1) The Reactivity Level scale (RL)–from 0 to 5 points: 0-normal level; RL-5 confirms systemic nature of inflammatory mediator release, and RL- 2–4 defines different degrees of event probability. 2) The SI scale, considering additional criteria along with RL, addresses more integral criteria of SI: the presence of ≥ 5 points according to the SI scale proves the high probability of SI developing. To calculate the RL scale, concentrations of 4 cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α) and C-reactive protein in plasma were examined. Additional criteria of the SI scale were the following: D-dimers>500ng/ml, cortisol>1380 or <100nmol/l, troponin I≥0.2ng/ml and/or myoglobin≥800ng/ml. 422 patients were included in the study with different septic (n-207) and aseptic (n-215) pathologies. In 190 cases (of 422) there were signs of SI (lethality 38.4%, n-73). In only 5 of 78 cases, lethality was not confirmed by the presence of SI. SI was registered in 100% of cases with septic shock (n-31). There were not significant differences between AU-ROC of CR, SI scale and SOFA to predict death in patients with sepsis and trauma."
https://openalex.org/W2346761603,"Several etiologies result in chronic liver diseases including chronic hepatitis C virus infection (HCV). Despite its high incidence and the severe economic and medical consequences, liver disease is still commonly overlooked due to the lack of efficient non-invasive diagnostic methods. While several techniques have been tested for the detection of fibrosis, the available biomarkers still present severe limitations that preclude their use in clinical diagnostics. Liver diseases have also been the subject of metabolomic analysis. Here, we demonstrate the suitability of 1H NMR spectroscopy for characterizing the metabolism of liver fibrosis induced by HCV. Serum samples from HCV patients without fibrosis or with liver cirrhosis were analyzed by NMR spectroscopy and the results were submitted to multivariate and univariate statistical analysis. PLS-DA test was able to discriminate between advanced fibrotic and non-fibrotic patients and several metabolites were found to be up or downregulated in patients with cirrhosis. The suitability of the most significantly regulated metabolites was validated by ROC analysis. Our study reveals that choline, acetoacetate and low-density lipoproteins are the most informative biomarkers for predicting cirrhosis in HCV patients. Our results demonstrate that statistical analysis of 1H-NMR spectra is able to distinguish between fibrotic and non-fibrotic patients suffering from HCV, representing a novel diagnostic application for NMR spectroscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2346457782,"Myxoid/round cell (RC) liposarcomas (MLS) were originally classified into two distinct populations based on histological differences; a myxoid component and a RC component. It is notable that, depending on an increase of the RC component, the prognosis significantly differs. Hence, the RC component is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis. However, the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the malignancy of the RC component still remain largely unknown. Here, we report microRNA-135b (miR-135b), a key regulator of the malignancy, highly expressed in the RC component and promoting MLS cell invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo through the direct suppression of thrombospondin 2 (THBS2). Decreased THBS2 expression by miR-135b increases the total amount of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and influences cellular density and an extracellular matrix structure, thereby resulting in morphological change in tumor. The expression levels of miR-135b and THBS2 significantly correlated with a poor prognosis in MLS patients. Overall, our study reveals that the miR-135b/THBS2/MMP2 axis is tightly related to MLS pathophysiology and has an important clinical implication. This work provides noteworthy evidence for overcoming metastasis and improving patient outcomes, and sheds light on miR-135b and THBS2 as novel molecular targets for diagnosis and therapy in MLS."
https://openalex.org/W2345926184,"This study aims at conducting the first science mapping analysis of the Mediterranean forest research in order to elucidate its research structure and evolution. We applied a science mapping approach based on co-term and citation analyses to a set of scientific publications retrieved from the Elsevier's Scopus database over the period 1980-2014. The Scopus search retrieved 2,698 research papers and reviews published by 159 peer-reviewed journals. The total number of publications was around 1% (N = 17) during the period 1980-1989 and they reached 3% (N = 69) in the time slice 1990-1994. Since 1995, the number of publications increased exponentially, thus reaching 55% (N = 1,476) during the period 2010-2014. Within the thirty-four years considered, the retrieved publications were published by 88 countries. Among them, Spain was the most productive country, publishing 44% (N = 1,178) of total publications followed by Italy (18%, N = 482) and France (12%, N = 336). These countries also host the ten most productive scientific institutions in terms of number of publications in Mediterranean forest subjects. Forest Ecology and Management and Annals of Forest Science were the most active journals in publishing research in Mediterranean forest. During the period 1980-1994, the research topics were poorly characterized, but they become better defined during the time slice 1995-1999. Since 2000s, the clusters become well defined by research topics. Current status of Mediterranean forest research (20092014) was represented by four clusters, in which different research topics such as biodiversity and conservation, land-use and degradation, climate change effects on ecophysiological responses and soil were identified. Basic research in Mediterranean forest ecosystems is mainly conducted by ecophysiological research. Applied research was mainly represented by land-use and degradation, biodiversity and conservation and fire research topics. The citation analyses revealed highly cited terms in the Mediterranean forest research as they were represented by fire, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, climate change and global warming. Finally, our analysis also revealed the multidisciplinary role of climate change research. This study provides a first holistic view of the Mediterranean forest research that could be useful for researchers and policy makers as they may evaluate and analyze its historical evolution, as well as its structure and scientific production. We concluded that Mediterranean forest research represents an active scientific field."
https://openalex.org/W2275202130,"Climate change is a global phenomenon that is considered an important threat to marine ecosystems. Ocean acidification and increased seawater temperatures are among the consequences of this phenomenon. The comprehension of the effects of these alterations on marine organisms, in particular on calcified macroalgae, is still modest despite its great importance. There are evidences that macroalgae inhabiting highly variable environments are relatively resilient to such changes. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate experimentally the effects of CO2-driven ocean acidification and temperature rises on the photosynthesis of calcified macroalgae inhabiting the intertidal region, a highly variable environment. The experiments were performed in a reef mesocosm in a tropical region on the Brazilian coast, using three species of frondose calcifying macroalgae (Halimeda cuneata, Padina gymnospora, and Tricleocarpa cylindrica) and crustose coralline algae. The acidification experiment consisted of three treatments with pH levels below those occurring in the region (-0.3, -0.6, -0.9). For the temperature experiment, three temperature levels above those occurring naturally in the region (+1, +2, +4°C) were determined. The results of the acidification experiment indicate an increase on the optimum quantum yield by T. cylindrica and a decline of this parameter by coralline algae, although both only occurred at the extreme acidification treatment (-0.9). The energy dissipation mechanisms of these algae were also altered at this extreme condition. Significant effects of the temperature experiment were limited to an enhancement of the photosynthetic performance by H. cuneata although only at a modest temperature increase (+1°C). In general, the results indicate a possible photosynthetic adaptation and/or acclimation of the studied macroalgae to the expected future ocean acidification and temperature rises, as separate factors. Such relative resilience may be a result of the highly variable environment they inhabit."
https://openalex.org/W2345865835,"Using a 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT)-inducible, conditional Sos1-null mutation, we analyzed wild-type (WT), single Sos1-KO, Sos2-KO and double Sos1/2 KO primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) with an aim at evaluating the functional specificity or redundancy of the Sos1 and Sos2 alleles at the cellular level. The 4OHT-induced Sos1-KO and Sos1/2-DKO MEFs exhibited distinct flat morphology, enlarged cell perimeter and altered cytoskeletal organization that were not observed in the WT and Sos2-KO counterparts. The Sos1-KO and Sos1/2-DKO MEFs also displayed significant accumulation, in comparison with WT and Sos2-KO MEFs, of cytoplasmic vesicular bodies identified as autophagosomes containing degraded mitochondria by means of electron microscopy and specific markers. Cellular proliferation and migration were impaired in Sos1-KO and Sos1/2-DKO MEFs in comparison with WT and Sos2-KO MEFs, whereas cell adhesion was only impaired upon depletion of both Sos isoforms. RasGTP formation was practically absent in Sos1/2-DKO MEFs as compared with the other genotypes and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation showed only significant reduction after combined Sos1/2 depletion. Consistent with a mitophagic phenotype, in vivo labeling with specific fluorophores uncovered increased levels of oxidative stress (elevated intracellular reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial superoxide and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential) in the Sos1-KO and the Sos1/2-DKO cells as compared with Sos2-KO and WT MEFs. Interestingly, treatment of the MEF cultures with antioxidants corrected the altered phenotypes of Sos1-KO and Sos1/2-DKO MEFs by restoring their altered perimeter size and proliferative rate to levels similar to those of WT and Sos2-KO MEFs. Our data uncover a direct mechanistic link between Sos1 and control of intracellular oxidative stress, and demonstrate functional prevalence of Sos1 over Sos2 with regards to cellular proliferation and viability."
https://openalex.org/W2346878198,"Multiple myeloma is one of the most common hematological diseases and is characterized by an aberrant proliferation of plasma cells within the bone marrow. As a result of crosstalk between cancer cells and the bone microenvironment, bone homeostasis is disrupted leading to osteolytic lesions and poor prognosis. Current diagnostic strategies for myeloma typically rely on detection of excess monoclonal immunoglobulins or light chains in the urine or serum. However, these strategies fail to localize the sites of malignancies. In this study we sought to identify novel biomarkers of myeloma bone disease which could target the malignant cells and/or the surrounding cells of the tumor microenvironment. From these studies, the KISS1 receptor (KISS1R), a G-protein-coupled receptor known to play a role in the regulation of endocrine functions, was identified as a target gene that was upregulated on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and osteoprogenitor cells (OPCs) when co-cultured with myeloma cells. To determine the potential of this receptor as a biomarker, in vitro and in vivo studies were performed with the KISS1R ligand, kisspeptin, conjugated with a fluorescent dye. In vitro microscopy showed binding of fluorescently-labeled kisspeptin to both myeloma cells as well as MSCs under direct co-culture conditions. Next, conjugated kisspeptin was injected into immune-competent mice containing myeloma bone lesions. Tumor-burdened limbs showed increased peak fluorescence compared to contralateral controls. These data suggest the utility of the KISS1R as a novel biomarker for multiple myeloma, capable of targeting both tumor cells and host cells of the tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2345853178,"The translation of medically relevant academic inventions that could transform public health has been notoriously difficult, stemming largely from cultural differences been academia and industry. New initiatives to kindle academic entrepreneurship and establish stronger public/private partnerships are helping to align these differences and accelerating the translation of promising new therapies. The translation of medically relevant academic inventions that could transform public health has been notoriously difficult, stemming largely from cultural differences been academia and industry. New initiatives to kindle academic entrepreneurship and establish stronger public/private partnerships are helping to align these differences and accelerating the translation of promising new therapies. Academic medicine is experiencing a revolution that is poised to transform public health, growing largely out of a culture of innovation and a deep knowledge of human disease mechanisms. This has led to groundbreaking advances in the fields of oncology, cardiology, hematology, and neurology, among others. Translation of these innovations is key to meeting global health care demands; however, <5% of all life science discoveries made in academia are translated into a change in clinical practice, new medications, diagnostics, or devices. What is the root of this disappointingly low rate of translation? Is it because the initial ideas were poorly conceived, immature, or misaligned with the interests of potential industry partners? The answer is complex (Butler, 2008Butler D. Nature. 2008; 453: 840-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, Duda et al., 2014Duda G.N. Grainger D.W. Frisk M.L. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Carr A. Dirnagl U. Einhäupl K.M. Gottschalk S. Gruskin E. Huber C. et al.Sci. Transl. Med. 2014; 6: 264cm12Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, one factor is that, in order to reach the market, efforts in academia must pass through industry. Unfortunately, industry’s market-oriented structure places a highly selective filter on which discoveries are taken and developed, in part based on restricted portfolios and a need to embrace projects with low risk and high return on investment. This filter is particular tight for new drug-based therapeutics, due to the extremely high costs of development (>$100 million) and the long development time (∼15 yrs) that consumes most of a patent’s life (20–25 years), thereby further reducing a company’s return on investment. To compensate for these costs, pharmaceutical companies not only charge high prices for their drugs, but also have often reduced or eliminated their expensive in-house research and development (R&D) efforts, looking instead for growth by acquiring new technologies through mergers and acquisitions and me-too-drugs, policies that have greatly slowed the development of new drugs. Academia’s response to these translational roadblocks has been to capitalize on their own entrepreneurial spirit and “do it themselves.” This has led to an expansion of university-based, technology-transfer offices, attempts to commercialize academic inventions by forming startup companies, and the creation of incubators to support fledgling startups. However, pursuing these opportunities can be a daunting task for academics, as know-how on nearly all levels and strategic funds are often lacking for such risky ventures. How can this critical gap be bridged (Figure 1)? Cultural change in both academia and industry is needed so that each can learn and profit from one other’s strengths and compensate for weaknesses (Duda et al., 2014Duda G.N. Grainger D.W. Frisk M.L. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Carr A. Dirnagl U. Einhäupl K.M. Gottschalk S. Gruskin E. Huber C. et al.Sci. Transl. Med. 2014; 6: 264cm12Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This will require not only a better understanding of what motivates each group, but also the creation of cross-cultural education programs that teach the fundamentals of drug development, as well as strategies for engagement and establishment of meaningful partnerships. Here, we highlight programs facilitating a cultural change in academia to overcome these obstacles (for more on cultural changes in industry, please see Ehrismann and Patel, 2015Ehrismann D. Patel D. Swiss Med. Wkly. 2015; 145: w14086PubMed Google Scholar). We also discuss the importance of academic inventions and knowledge as a vital university currency that needs to be protected and developed to further accelerate translation. Over the last few decades, the culture within academic institutions has been changing from one focused largely on acquiring basic knowledge to one that is ever more applied (Fang and Casadevall, 2010Fang F.C. Casadevall A. Infect. Immun. 2010; 78: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Of particular note are the changes within the life sciences, where an increasing proportion of research is becoming oriented toward medically relevant problems. This change is motivated by patient advocacy groups and foundations and by policy changes within government programs. These organizations seek to create a stronger translational atmosphere wherein clinicians and basic scientists work across disciplines to solve medically relevant problems. Academic institutions are responding in turn by creating programs that reduce the barriers associated with the inefficient translation of new technologies. These include institutional structures that facilitate the design and execution of clinical trials, educational programs for faculty, students, and postdoctoral fellows on the fundamentals of translation and entrepreneurship, and the establishment of savvy technology-transfer (TT) offices that not only streamline the consolidation, patenting, and licensing of innovative projects/concepts, but also make possible partnering agreements and project management to facilitate the acceptance and development of high-impact programs by industry. A survey of programs across the most successful translational institutions worldwide reveals no one path for successful translation but a myriad of strategies tailored to perceived and evolving needs. These operate on many levels, addressing different steps in the translational cycle of discovery, development, clinical assessment, and commercialization (Table 1). Early efforts to facilitate clinical translation within academia included the establishment of a national network of medical research institutions in the US by the NIH. These centers, managed by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and supported by Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA; http://ncats.nih.gov/ctsa/about), are designed to improve and streamline the translational research process and to catalyze innovation in the training of translational scientists and the development of new research tools.Table 1Programs, in Order of Appearance: February 14, 2016NIH, USAhttp://www.nih.gov/Wellcome Trust, UKhttp://www.wellcome.ac.uk/Helmholtz Gemeinschaft, Germanyhttp://www.helmholtz.de/NCATS, USAhttps://ncats.nih.gov/CTSA, USAhttps://ctsacentral.orgHarvard Catalyst, USAhttps://catalyst.harvard.edu/http://www.harvardtrials.org/homehttps://catalyst.harvard.edu/services/kl2Duke Translational Med.

In general, CTSA funds are used to organize resources within each hub. For example, in Boston, the Harvard Catalyst works to enhance translation between 10 schools and 17 affiliated academic healthcare centers (https://catalyst.harvard.edu/). This program offers clinical and translational investigators the necessary resources to design, analyze, and conduct clinical trials, including consulting in areas such as biostatistics and biomedical imaging. At present, there are more than 1,800 open clinical trials supported by this program (http://www.harvardtrials.org/home). In addition, the Harvard Catalyst provides courses and training programs on translational and clinical research, which include a practitioner’s teaching program called KL2 (https://catalyst.harvard.edu/services/kl2/). Importantly, this program is designed to streamline the process of translation by removing barriers and creating a culture of collaboration and acquisition of third-party funding. Such features are similarly highlighted at other highly successful translational programs, including those at Duke (Duke Translational Medicine Institute) and Johns Hopkins (Institute for Clinical and Translational Research), both supported by the CTSA program. Moreover, the concept of government support of clinical translational programs is not unique to the United States. Indeed, similar initiatives can be found in Canada (CQDM, Quebec Consortium for Drug Discovery), Japan (TRI, Translational Research Initiative), the United Kingdom (MRC, Medical Research Council), and Germany (Helmholtz Gemeinschaft). While the augmentation of clinical translational programs is a key step in the efficient assessment of potential therapies, the creation of innovative therapies requires a series of iterative steps that begin with a basic science discovery or clinical observation that can be causally linked to disease. Though many of these outstanding discoveries appear in high-profile journals, few (<5%) enter the clinic, are licensed for further development, or become the new standard of care. There are several reasons for these low numbers. One is the failure of academic inventors to protect their ideas through patenting, a tool that is crucial for industry to conduct business. Other factors include the absence of proof of concept data demonstrating that the potential therapy has clinical relevance; the poor characterization of new chemical entities or diagnostics; and the selection of diseases/indications for which there are existing therapies or that pharmaceutical/biotech companies (pharma) have already invested billions into without success (e.g., stroke and Alzheimer’s disease). These issues point to a larger problem, namely that scientists and clinicians do not fully understand how industry works or what is needed to make their inventions attractive for further development and/or commercialization. From a 10,000-ft perspective, the answer seems obvious: education. Yet oddly enough, academic programs designed to address this unmet need only began to emerge during the last decade. Many of these have been driven by early academic entrepreneurs who faced daunting challenges in de-risking and promoting their programs and who brought the knowledge they gained through such experiences back to their host institutions. Daria Mochly-Rosen, a Professor at Stanford University, is one such person, who has worked passionately to influence the conversation of how academia can enhance drug development in industry. She labored for years to translate discoveries from her laboratory into clinically viable therapies, including the founding of a company to develop drugs to treat cardiovascular and kidney diseases (www.kaipharmaceuticals.com). After a year’s leave of absence from Stanford, she realized that much of what she learned was not part of the academic culture or organizational knowledge held within academia. This drove her to establish one of the first educational programs for academics, called SPARK, which teaches the fundamentals of drug development from discovery to market access (med.stanford.edu/sparkmed). Importantly, programs like SPARK empower scientists and clinicians to gain control over the licensing and marketability of their inventions, a prerequisite for successful academic translations. This new power is helping to shape the landscape of academic/industry partnerships. The concepts embedded in SPARK are not unique and are emerging with different flavors at institutions around the globe. These include project-oriented educational programs designed to foster entrepreneurship in academia, an understanding of drug development in industry, and project-management skills. Most are small grass-roots initiatives with a strong entrepreneurial focus. Some examples of these programs include Duke University’s Innovation and Entrepreneurship Initiative, Stanford’s Biodesign Innnovation Fellowship, the Entrepreneurial Workshops at the University of Vermont, and the Biomedical Innovation and Entrepreneurship program at the University of Technology, Sidney, among others. A common thread in these programs is that they combine inquiring minds with sound management skills in a hip Silicon Valley style. Academic initiators of these different programs obviously agree that clinicians and scientists of life sciences lack an entrepreneurial self-image as well as solid knowledge of business culture. Many of these initiatives follow a very thoughtful attempt to guide scientists step-by-step until their projects are ready for licensing, clinical development, and/or startups. For example, within SPARK, innovative projects thrive under the guidance of experienced and dedicated local teachers, mentors, and advisors who volunteer their time, knowledge, and networks (Mochly-Rosen and Grimes, 2014Mochly-Rosen D. Grimes K. A Practical Guide to Drug Development in Academia: The SPARK Approach. Springer, 2014Crossref Google Scholar) and who help define and guide nascent entrepreneurs along the path of drug, diagnostic, or device development. A typical Stanford-SPARK project can be oriented toward any indication, yet must address an unmet need, represent a novel strategy, and hold the potential to advance to commercialization and/or clinical testing within 2–3 years (med.stanford.edu/sparkmed). Additionally, teams are actively encouraged to embrace the Biotech and Venture Capital community, establishing partnerships, funding, and paths to commodification (www.bio.org). A key feature of these educational programs is a crash course in drug, device, and product development, intellectual property management, and introduction to venture capital, as well as opportunities to establish startup companies. The success rate of SPARK-Stanford is amazingly high, with >55% of projects/yr being licensed, entering the clinic, or becoming commercialized (med.stanford.edu/sparkmed), compared to ∼5% before the program began. Moreover, since its inception in 2006, 24 universities in 8 countries have created SPARK-like programs. This global initiative is designed to build a strong network of academic institutions and industry partners that foster innovation, entrepreneurship, and translation in human health care, as well as share resources, educational programs, advisors, and strategies for efficient project management. These programs are beautifully complemented by educational program such as I-Corps, OneStart, and StartupClass. Programs such as these teach business skills to budding entrepreneurs, helping them determine the best path to commercialization and a successful startup (Ledford, 2015Ledford H. Nature. 2015; 519: 402-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). To complement these educational programs, academic institutions are increasing their emphasis on technology transfer and commercialization of their academic inventions. This is clearly a rocky path that requires experienced technology transfer offices (TTO) to provide firm legal and business knowledge and extensive networks to achieve successful translation. Most institutions create their own offices that work closely with faculty to craft, file, and license patents, such as Unitectra in Switzerland (Basel, Bern, and Zurich), the Office of Cooperative Research at Yale University in the US, or Technology Ventures at Columbia University, also in the US. These classical TTOs offer the university patent protection, funding, and support in commercialization by licensing or starting new companies. Other institutions have created regional consortium agreements, with a centralized office that provides technology transfer to local networks of academic organizations. For example, the Boston Biomedical Innovation Center, supported by the National Centers for Accelerated Innovation (NCAI), is a consortium of universities, non-profits, government organizations, pharma companies, and venture capital firms. It is designed to accelerate translation of early stage biomedical innovations into commercially viable products by providing pilot grants, project management, and coaching, as well as connections to industry and investors. Similar strategies are used by the Max Planck Society in Germany, the Medical Research Council in the UK, and the MaRS Innovation program in Toronto, Canada. While most of these are homegrown TTOs and feed revenues back into their own network to support further research, others are privately held for-profit enterprises (e.g., i360, Ascenion). Increasingly, academic institutions and governments are recognizing the need to do more in the area of drug development, where risks are high and failure frequent. Thus, to complement efforts in TT and commercialization, the last decade has seen the appearance of numerous centers for drug development. For example, Canada has set up a national Centre for Drug Research and Development (CDRD), providing expertise and infrastructure to enable researchers to advance early stage drug candidates (http://www.cdrd.ca). Similarly, MaRS Innovation and Max Planck Innovation have created spinoffs, the Quebec consortium for Drug Discovery (CQDM; http://www.cqdm.org/en/) and the Lead Discovery Center (LDC; www.lead-discovery.de), respectively, which work to transform promising projects into innovative pharmaceutical leads that reach proof of concept in animal models. A particularly interesting enterprise for facilitating drug development is the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC; http://www.thesgc.org/about), a not-for-profit public-private partnership between 6 major universities and 13 separate organizations that include 9 pharma companies, government institutions, and foundations. The goal of this effort is to determine the 3D structures of biomedically important human proteins, representing potential drug targets. This open-source program deposits each solved structure into the PDB, providing global access to less well-studied areas of the human genome, simplifying target identification and increasing the chances for drug discovery. There are obvious pros and cons to each of these programs. In general, all sow the seeds for a translational surge that helps otherwise-trapped medically relevant innovations to reach the public. They also provide critical knowledge from business and industry experts. The advantage of programs with educational components is that knowhow is more systematically transferred into universities and institutions, a process that also helps create a new generation of true translators and entrepreneurs. A further incentive for the acquisition of this knowledge is the increasing recognition by universities that their creativity and inventiveness are valuable currencies that need to be both managed and exploited. Ultimately, these features will make them stronger and more valuable to industry as they forge partnerships to more efficiently translate new potential therapies. Yet, the challenges for these programs are numerous. Resources and quality management for such programs are often limited, a situation that is best solved by tapping into government programs or entering into a regional network of universities. These programs may also force unwanted changes in institutional culture, currently dominated by the “publish or perish” attitude, with little or no recognition or incentives for faculty who invest time in the business side of translation. As we have already noted, academia and industry possess complementary knowledge and skills, so it makes sense for them to find strategies for working together effectively. Clearly, this requires an understanding of what motivates each party, defining what each does best and how to work in a mutually beneficial arrangement. While breaking down these barriers has been challenging, new emerging business models are beginning to make a difference. These include proactive policies to engage academic institutions and inventors, through incubators and partnerships. Most incubator programs function to help startup companies get established by providing space, infrastructure, project management, business assistance service, and access to venture capital. They are often associated with research and technology parks placed in close proximity to vibrant academic and biotech communities and can be operated privately by pharmaceutical companies or by governments (Kirkpatrick, 2015Kirkpatrick L. Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In Europe, these programs also offer mentoring, consulting, and prototype creation services. For example, Bayer’s Colaborator provides incubator space for rent (labs, offices, and meetings spots) next door to their R&D facilities in Berlin and San Francisco (http://www.colaborator.bayer.com). In addition to space, they provide infrastructure and equipment as well as an environment that offers young entrepreneurs, with a focus on drug targets and candidates, opportunities to exchange ideas and obtain expertise from Bayer’s research network. Similar programs have been created by Pfizer (Centers for Therapeutic Innovation in Boston), Novartis (Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research in Singapore), Celgene (Celgene Institute for Translational Research Europe in Spain) and Johnson & Johnson (Johnson & Johnson Innovation's JLABS), to mention but a few. To further enhance collaborations with academics, many pharma companies engage in partnering agreements to explore promising drugs, diagnostics, and devices (Luijten et al., 2012Luijten P.R. van Dongen G.A. Moonen C.T. Storm G. Crommelin D.J. J. Control. Release. 2012; 161: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In addition to providing resources, these programs offer industry-style project management with clear sets of milestones that focus projects toward proof of concept. As with the incubator programs, they provide advice from industry experts and access to sophisticated screening, testing, and manufacturing facilities. From our experience, the trickiest and most time-consuming aspect of partnership with industry is the establishment of fair contracts, as language about shared intellectual property hugely impacts future success during commercialization. As “the devil is in the details,” we highly recommend creating a frame contract with every industry partner that tackles intellectual property topics and allows the addition of contracts for further projects without having to renegotiate the heart of the collaboration. Importantly, academics should not enter such programs with rose-colored glasses and the illusion that access is a guaranteed path to commercialization. There are still very strong market and portfolio barriers that dictate whether promising programs are continued or killed, irrespective of how brilliant they seem. In this regard, educational programs such as those mentioned above should help to balance the expectations of academic scientists with reality. In the coming years, the dialog between academia and industry will need to be further expanded. This conversation should include how each can best contribute to a more fruitful translational atmosphere. At present, academia brings two extremely useful components to the discussion. First, the academic culture of unbridled creativity is the genesis of many future medically relevant therapies, diagnostics, and devices. Second, the large clinical establishments and well-characterized cohorts of patients at academic medical centers will be of vital importance to the evaluation of emerging therapies. On the other hand, industry offers unparalleled expertise in drug development and regulatory issues. It also has the capacity, through incubators, investments, mentorships, and partnerships, to take and de-risk early academic discoveries, facilitating their further development. In considering partnerships, there are advantages to engaging both large and small pharma companies, depending on the product. For example, big pharma, with its aversion to risk and its desire for blockbuster drugs (>$1 billion; Fischer and Breitenbach, 2015Fischer D. Breitenbach J. Die Pharmaindustrie: Einblick Durchblick Perspektiven.Fourth Edition. Springer Spektrum, 2015Google Scholar), to cover the high cost of R&D, tends to favor new therapeutic targets/drugs for unmet medical indications, where they can gain market exclusivity. Conversely, smaller biotech companies are more easily inspired by innovation. They are generally less risk aversive and more entrepreneurial in their approach and thus willing to embrace new early stage technologies. This flexible ideology likely arises in part because these companies have a recent academic/entrepreneurial origin. One of the hardest groups of drugs to develop through industry is off-patent drugs. However, many of these fall into the repurposing class, which are already approved for other indications and can be rapidly evaluated and introduced for use in a clinical setting. Based on the growing number of translational grassroots programs, it is clear that academia is seeking to do more to move basic scientific findings to the clinic, a path complemented by government programs to validate new drugs and targets and to test them in humans. Importantly, the success of these exciting programs will require a cultural change within universities as well as new project-management skills. Each project requires a thoughtful process of change management (http://www.kotterinternational.com), adapted for each institution. In this respect, we advocate a policy wherein universities continue to recognize that their intellectual property is a currency that needs to be protected, properly managed, and expanded. Projects with commercial potential need to be identified early, protected with patents, managed, de-risked, and validated and have value added by investment until they are attractive for licensing, startup, or commercialization. This strategy should be viewed as a team sport and should occur at nearly all levels of university management, including basic and clinical scientists and university administration. It is also critical to recognize that patenting is the currency required by businesses to commercialize all concepts and products. Thus, in order for academics to become true translators, they need to understand the culture of industry and to engage in all aspects of the translational process. Finally, it is important that the burden of translation not fall solely on the shoulders of academia. Industry must do much more than simply wait for academic inventions to fill their dwindling pipelines. They must be more proactive in creating mechanisms to fund early stage projects, establishing attractive partnership agreements that incentivize academic collaborations, and sponsoring educational and mentorship programs. Let us share the burden for the benefit of patients.

https://openalex.org/W2345535018,"Adiponectin is the most abundantly produced human adipokine with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and insulin-sensitizing properties. Evidence from in vitro studies has indicated that adiponectin has a potential role in reproduction because it reduces the production of androstenedione in bovine theca cells in vitro. However, this effect on androgen production has not yet been observed in vivo. The current study evaluated the effect of adiponectin on androstenedione secretion and oxidative stress parameters in a rodent model. Seven-week-old female Balb/c mice (n = 33), previously treated with equine gonadotropin chorionic, were assigned to one of four different treatments: Group 1, control (phosphate-buffered saline); Group 2, adiponectin 0.1 μg/mL; Group 3, adiponectin 1.0 μg/mL; Group 4, adiponectin 5.0 μg/mL. After 24 h, all animals were euthanized and androstenedione levels were measured in the serum while oxidative stress markers were quantified in whole ovary tissue. Female mice treated with adiponectin exhibited a significant reduction (about 60%) in serum androstenedione levels in comparison to controls. Androstenedione levels decreased from 0.78 ± 0.4 ng/mL (mean ± SD) in controls to 0.28 ± 0.06 ng/mL after adiponectin (5 μg/mL) treatment (P = 0.01). This change in androgen secretion after 24 hours of treatment was associated with a significant reduction in the expression of CYP11A1 and STAR (but not CYP17A1). In addition, ovarian AOPP product levels, a direct product of protein oxidation, decreased significantly in adiponectin-treated mice (5 μg/mL); AOPP (mean ± SD) decreased to 4.3 ± 2.1 μmol/L in comparison with that of the controls (11.5 ± 1.7 μmol/L; P = 0.0003). Our results demonstrated for the first time that acute treatment with adiponectin reduced the levels of a direct oxidative stress marker in the ovary as well as decreased androstenedione serum levels in vivo after 24 h."
https://openalex.org/W2345811989,"As multiple sclerosis research progresses, it is pertinent to continue to develop suitable paradigms to allow for ever more sophisticated investigations. Animal models of multiple sclerosis, despite their continuing contributions to the field, may not be the most prudent for every experiment. Indeed, such may be either insufficient to reflect the functional impact of human genetic variations or unsuitable for drug screenings. Thus, we have established a cell- and patient-specific paradigm to provide an in vitro model within which to perform future genetic investigations. Renal proximal tubule epithelial cells were isolated from multiple sclerosis patients’ urine and transfected with pluripotency-inducing episomal factors. Subsequent induced pluripotent stem cells were formed into embryoid bodies selective for ectodermal lineage, resulting in neural tube-like rosettes and eventually neural progenitor cells. Differentiation of these precursors into primary neurons was achieved through a regimen of neurotrophic and other factors. These patient-specific primary neurons displayed typical morphology and functionality, also staining positive for mature neuronal markers. The development of such a non-invasive procedure devoid of permanent genetic manipulation during the course of differentiation, in the context of multiple sclerosis, provides an avenue for studies with a greater cell- and human-specific focus, specifically in the context of genetic contributions to neurodegeneration and drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2346307417,"Understanding the status and spatial distribution of endangered species in biologically and ethnologically diverse areas is important to address correlates of cultural and biological diversity. We developed models for endangered musk deer (Moschus spp.) abundance indices in and around protected areas inhabited by different ethnic groups in northwest Yunnan China to address different anthropogenic and management-related questions. We found that prediction of relative abundance of musk deer was best accomplished using ethnicity of settlements, conservation status and poaching pressure in an area. Musk deer were around 5 times more abundant in Tibetan regions relative to Lisu regions. We found no significant negative correlates of gathering and transhumance activities on musk deer abundance. Hunting pressure showed no significant differences between protected and non-protected areas, but showed significant differences among ethnic groups. Hunting pressures in areas adjacent to Lisu settlements was 7.1 times more than in areas adjacent to Tibetan settlements. Our findings indicate protected areas in southwest China are not fully effective in deterring human disturbance caused by traditional practices. We suggest that conservation and management strategies should engage traditional culture and practices with a positive conservation impact. Better understanding of indigenous culture may open up new opportunities for species conservation in much wider tracts of unprotected and human-dominated lands. Traditional practices that are not destructive to biodiversity should be allowed as a way of providing a link between the local communities and protected areas thereby creating incentives for conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2345438917,"Objective The fractal dimension of retinal arteries and veins is a measure of the complexity of the vascular tree. We hypothesized that retinal fractal dimension would be associated with brain volume and white matter integrity in HIV-infected women. Design Nested case-control within longitudinal cohort study. Methods Women were recruited from the Brooklyn site of the Women’s Interagency HIV study (WIHS); 34 HIV-infected and 21 HIV-uninfected women with analyzable MRIs and retinal photographs were included. Fractal dimension was determined using the SIVA software program on skeletonized retinal images. The relationship between predictors (retinal vascular measures) and outcomes (quantitative MRI measures) were analyzed with linear regression models. All models included age, intracranial volume, and both arterial and venous fractal dimension. Some models were adjusted for blood pressure, race/ethnicity, and HIV-infection. Results The women were 45.6 ± 7.3 years of age. Higher arterial dimension was associated with larger cortical volumes, but higher venous dimension was associated with smaller cortical volumes. In fully adjusted models, venous dimension was significantly associated with fractional anisotropy (standardized β = -0.41, p = 0.009) and total gray matter volume (β = -0.24, p = 0.03), and arterial dimension with mean diffusivity (β = -0.33,.p = 0.04) and fractional anisotropy (β = 0.34, p = 0.03). HIV-infection was not associated with any retinal or MRI measure. Conclusions Higher venous fractal dimension was associated with smaller cortical volumes and lower fractional anisotropy, whereas higher arterial fractal dimension was associated with the opposite patterns. Longitudinal studies are needed to validate this finding."
https://openalex.org/W2345885495,"Reproductive strategies comprise the timing and frequency of reproductive events and the number of offspring per reproductive event, depending on factors such as climate conditions. Therefore, species that exhibit plasticity in the allocation of reproductive effort can alter their behavior in response to climate change. Studying how the reproductive strategy of species varies along the latitudinal gradient can help us understand and predict how they will respond to climate change. We investigated the effects of the temporal allocation of reproductive effort on the population size of brown shrimp (Farfantepenaeus aztecus) along a latitudinal gradient. Multiple shrimp species exhibit variation in their reproductive strategies, and given the economic importance of brown shrimp to the commercial fishing sector of the Unites States, changes in the timing of their reproduction could have significant economic and social consequences. We used a stage-based, density-dependent matrix population model tailored to the life history of brown shrimp. Shrimp growth rates and environmental carrying capacity were varied based on the seasonal climate conditions at different latitudes, and we estimated the population size at equilibrium. The length of the growing season increased with decreasing latitude and the reproductive strategy leading to the highest population size changed from one annual birth pulse with high reproductive output to continuous low-output reproduction. Hence, our model confirms the classical paradigm of continuous reproduction at low latitudes, with increased seasonality of the breeding period towards the poles. Our results also demonstrate the potential for variation in climate to affect the optimal reproductive strategy for achieving maximum population sizes. Certainly, understanding these dynamics may inform more comprehensive management strategies for commercially important species like brown shrimp."
https://openalex.org/W2346250692,"Human colorectal cancer is often initiated by the aberrant activation of Wnt signaling, notably following adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) inactivation. Recent studies identified adult intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and demonstrated their role as the cells of origin for intestinal tumors. However, the early consequences of aberrant Wnt signaling activation remain to be fully elucidated. Here, using organoid cultures established from conditional knockout mice and in vitro gene ablation, we show that Apc inactivation led to aberrant ISC proliferation and the expansion of the crypt domain. This system was used to evaluate the potential of a cancer-related spindle protein, Tacc3, as a target of cancer therapy, as its disruption led to the suppression of tumor formation in an animal model of intestinal tumors. We found that Tacc3 is required for the proper mitosis of Apc-deficient ISCs, and its disruption significantly attenuated the expansion of the crypt domain. In vivo analysis of corresponding mutant mice demonstrated that Tacc3 disruption led to a significant decrease in tumor number and prolonged survival. These observations demonstrated that Tacc3 is a potential chemotherapeutic target for intestinal tumors by perturbing the aberrant cell proliferation of Apc-deficient ISCs and provides an opportunity for the development of novel cancer prevention and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2346264073,"Background Health expenditures are a major financial burden for many persons in low and middle-income countries, where individuals often lack health insurance. We estimate the effect of purchasing cardiovascular medicines on poverty in low and middle-income populations using rural and urban India as an example. Methods We created step-up treatment regimens for prevention of ischemic heart disease for the most common cardiovascular medications in India based on their cost and relative risk reduction. Cost was measured by Government of India mandated ceiling prices in rupees (Rs. 1 = $0·016) for essential medicines plus taxes. We calculated step-wise projected incidence and intensity of impoverishment due to medicine purchase. To do this we measured the resources available to individuals as daily per-capita expenditures from the latest National Sample Survey, subtracted daily medication costs, and compared this to 2014 poverty thresholds recommended by an expert group. Findings Analysis of cost-effectiveness resulted in five primary prevention drug regimens, created by progressive addition of Aspirin 75 mg, Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg, Losartan 25 mg, and Atorvastatin 10 mg or 40mg. Daily cost from steps 1 to 5 increased from Rs. 0·13, Rs. 1.16, Rs. 3.81, Rs. 10.07, to Rs. 28.85. At baseline, 31% of rural and 27% percent of urban Indian population are poor at the designated poverty thresholds. The Rs. 28.85 regimen would be unaffordable to 81% and 58% of rural and urban people. A secondary prevention regimen with aspirin, hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol and atorvastatin could be unaffordable to 81% and 57% rural and urban people respectively. According to our estimates, 17% of the rural 32% of the urban adult population could benefit with these medications, and their out of pocket purchase could impoverish 17 million rural and 10 million urban people in India and increase respective poverty gaps by 2.9%. Conclusion Medication costs for cardiovascular disease have the potential to cause financial burden to a significant proportion of people in India. These costs increase the likelihood that patients will forego needed treatment and emphasize the need for programs to reduce the costs of medications for cardiovascular patients in India, including by expansion of prescription drug coverage."
https://openalex.org/W2345549739,"Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 4 (CPEB4) is a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein and translational regulator, with expression associated with tumor progression. Nevertheless, CPEB4 seems to play paradoxical roles in cancers–an oncogenic promoter in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) and glioblastomas but a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To assess whether CPEB4-regulated carcinogenesis is tissue-specific, we reevaluated the role of CPEB4 in HCC. Although proliferation of hepatocytes appeared normal in CPEB4-knockout (KO) mice after partial hepatectomy, knockdown (KD) of CPEB4 in HepG2 liver cancer cells promoted colony formation in vitro. Moreover, the growth of CPEB4-KD cells was accelerated in an in vivo xenograft mouse model. In tumorous and adjacent non-tumorous paired liver specimens from 49 HCC patients, the protein level of CPEB4 was significantly upregulated in early-stage HCC but decreased toward late-stage HCC. This finding agrees with changes in CPEB4 mRNA level from analysis of two sets of HCC microarray data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Taken together, downregulation of CPEB4 likely occurs at the late cancer stage to facilitate HCC progression. Biphasic alteration of CPEB4 expression during HCC progression suggests its complicated role in tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2345382534,"Yellow fever continues to be an important epidemiological problem in Africa and South America even though the disease can be controlled by vaccination. The vaccine has been produced since 1937 and is based on YFV 17DD chicken embryo infection. However, little is known about the histopathological background of virus infection and replication in this model. Here we show by morphological and molecular methods (brightfield and confocal microscopies, immunofluorescence, nested-PCR and sequencing) the kinetics of YFV 17DD infection in chicken embryos with 9 days of development, encompassing 24 to 96 hours post infection. Our principal findings indicate that the main cells involved in virus production are myoblasts with a mesenchymal shape, which also are the first cells to express virus proteins in Gallus gallus embryos at 48 hours after infection. At 72 hours post infection, we observed an increase of infected cells in embryos. Many sites are thus affected in the infection sequence, especially the skeletal muscle. We were also able to confirm an increase of nervous system infection at 96 hours post infection. Our data contribute to the comprehension of the pathogenesis of YF 17DD virus infection in Gallus gallus embryos."
