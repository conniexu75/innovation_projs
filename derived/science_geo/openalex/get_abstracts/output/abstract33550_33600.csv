https://openalex.org/W2040097492,"In skeletal muscle, intramembrane charge movement initiates the processes that lead to the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In cardiac muscle, in contrast, the similarity of the voltage dependence of developed tension and intracellular calcium transients to that of calcium current suggests that the calcium current may gate the release of calcium. Nevertheless, a mechanism similar to that of skeletal muscle continues to be postulated for cardiac muscle. By using rapid exchange (20 to 50 milliseconds) of the extracellular solutions in rat ventricular myocytes in which the intracellular calcium transients or cell shortening were measured, it has now been shown that the influx of calcium through the calcium channel is a mandatory link in the processes that couple membrane depolarization to the release of calcium. Thus, intramembrane charge movement does not contribute to the release of calcium in heart muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2065152876,"The pathogenicity of influenza virus infection in the mice involves, at least in part, overreaction of the immune responses of the host rather than a direct effect of virus multiplication. Xanthine oxidase, which is responsible for the generation of oxygen free radicals, was elevated in serum and lung tissue of mice infected with influenza virus. To test the theory that oxygen-free radicals are involved in pathogenesis, free radicals were removed by injecting superoxide dismutase (SOD), a specific superoxide radical scavenger, which was conjugated with a pyran copolymer. The conjugate protected mice against a potentially lethal influenza virus infection if administered 5 to 8 days after infection. These findings indicate that oxygen radicals are important in the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection, and that a polymer-conjugated SOD has therapeutic potential for this virus infection and other diseases associated with free radicals."
https://openalex.org/W1567116460,"Methane monooxygenase has been purified from the Type II methanotroph Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b. As observed for methane monooxygenase isolated from Type I methanotrophs, three protein components are required: a 39.7-kDa NADH reductase containing 1 mol each of FAD and a [2Fe-2S] cluster, a 15.8-kDa protein factor termed component B that contains no metals or cofactors, and a 245-kDa hydroxylase which appears to contain an oxo- or hydroxo-bridged binuclear iron cluster. Through the use of stabilizing reagents, the hydroxylase is obtained in high yield and exhibits a specific activity 8-25-fold greater than reported for previous preparations. The component B and reductase exhibit 1.5- and 4-fold greater specific activity, respectively. Quantitation of the hydroxylase oxo-bridged cluster using EPR and Mossbauer spectroscopies reveals that the highest specific activity preparations (approximately 1700 nmol/min/mg) contain approximately 2 clusters/mol. In contrast, hydroxylase preparations exhibiting a wide range of specific activities below 500 nmol/min/mg contain approximately 1 cluster/mol on average. Efficient turnover coupled to NADH oxidation requires all three protein components. However, both alkanes and alkenes are hydroxylated by the chemically reduced hydroxylase under single turnover conditions in the absence of component B and the reductase. Neither of these components catalyzes hydroxylation individually nor do they significantly affect the yield of hydroxylated product from the chemically reduced hydroxylase. Hydroxylase reduced only to the mixed valent [Fe(II).Fe(III)] state is unreactive toward O2 and yields little hydroxylated product on single turnover. This suggests that the catalytically active species is the fully reduced form. The data presented here provide the first evidence based on catalysis that the site of the monooxygenation reaction is located on the hydroxylase. It thus appears likely that the oxo-bridged iron cluster is capable of catalyzing oxygenase reactions without the intervention of other cofactors. This is a novel function for this type of cluster and implies a new mechanism for the generation of highly reactive oxygen capable of insertion into unactivated carbon-hydrogen bonds."

https://openalex.org/W1967597481,"Cell fusion (syncytium formation) is a major cytopathic effect of infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and may also represent an important mechanism of CD4+ T-cell depletion in individuals infected with HIV. Syncytium formation requires the interaction of CD4 on the surface of uninfected cells with HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 expressed on HIV-infected cells. However, several observations suggest that molecules other than CD4 play a role in HIV-induced cell fusion. The leukocyte adhesion receptor LFA-1 is involved in a broad range of leukocyte interactions mediated by diverse receptor-ligand systems including CD4-class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Possible mimicry of class II MHC molecules by gp120 in its interaction with CD4 prompted an examination of the role of LFA-1 in HIV-induced cell fusion. A monoclonal antibody against LFA-1 completely inhibited HIV-induced syncytium formation. The antibody did not block binding of gp120 to CD4. This demonstrates that a molecule other than CD4 is also involved in cell fusion mediated by HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2028618800,"In isolated heart cells, beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation induced a background current that was suppressed by simultaneous muscarinic receptor stimulation. Direct activation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin also elicited this current, suggesting regulation by adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP). This current could be recorded when sodium, calcium, and potassium currents were eliminated by channel antagonists or by ion substitution. Alteration of the chloride equilibrium potential produced changes in the reversal potential expected for a chloride current. Activation of this chloride current modulated action potential duration and altered the resting membrane potential in a chloride gradient-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1531570632,"Xanthine oxidase has been hypothesized to be an important source of biological free radical generation. The enzyme generates the superoxide radical, •O2− and has been widely applied as a •O2− generating system; however, the enzyme may also generate other forms of reduced oxygen. We have applied electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy using the spin trap 5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) to characterize the different radical species generated by xanthine oxidase along with the mechanisms of their generation. Upon reaction of xanthine with xanthine oxidase equilibrated with air, both DMPO-OOH and DMPO-OH radicals are observed. In the presence of ethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide, α-hydroxyethyl or methyl radicals are generated, respectively, indicating that significant DMPO-OH generation occurred directly from OH rather than simply from the breakdown of DMPO-OOH. Superoxide dismutase totally scavenged the DMPO-OOH signal but not the DMPO-OH signal suggesting that •O2− was not required for •OH generation. Catalase markedly decreased the DMPO-OH signal, while superoxide dismutase + catalase totally scavenged all radical generation. Thus, xanthine oxidase generates •OH via the reduction of O2 to H2O2, which in turn is reduced to •OH. In anaerobic preparations, the enzyme reduces H2O2 to •OH as evidenced by the appearance of a pure DMPO-OH signal. The presence of the flavin in the enzyme is required for both •O2− and •OH generation confirming that the flavin is the site of O2 reduction. The ratio of •O2− and •OH generation was affected by the relative concentrations of dissolved O2 and H2O2. Thus, xanthine oxidase can generate the highly reactive •OH radical as well as the less reactive •O2− radical. The direct production of •OH by xanthine oxidase in cells and tissues containing this enzyme could explain the presence of oxidative cellular damage which is not prevented by superoxide dismutase."
https://openalex.org/W1968679635,"The Sabin type 1 vaccine strain of poliovirus is probably the safest and most successful live-attenuated vaccine virus used in humans. Its widespread use since the early 1960s has contributed significantly to the virtual eradication of poliomyelitis in developed countries. We have reported previously the construction of an intertypic antigen chimaera of poliovirus, based on the Sabin 1 strain, and proposed that this virus could be modified to express on its surface antigenic determinants from other pathogens. We describe here the construction and characterization of a poliovirus antigen chimaera containing an epitope from the transmembrane glycoprotein (gp41) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). In antibody absorption experiments, the virus chimaera inhibited neutralization of HIV-1 by antipeptide monoclonal antibodies specific for the gp41 epitope and significantly reduced the group specific neutralizing activity of HIV-1-positive human sera. Rabbit antisera raised by subcutaneous injection of the polio/HIV chimaera in adjuvant was shown to be specific for HIV-1 gp41 in peptide-binding assays and by western blotting. Moreover, the antisera neutralized a wide range of American and African HIV-1 isolates and also inhibited virus-induced cell fusion. Monoclonal antibodies against the HIV-1 derived regions of the chimaera also neutralized HIV-1. These results establish the potential of using poliovirus for the presentation of foreign antigens and suggest that Sabin 1 poliovirus/HIV chimaeras could offer an approach to the development of an HIV vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W1496031212,"A recent hypothesis suggests that proteolytic activity of the micromolar and millimolar Ca2+-requiring forms of the Ca2+-dependent proteinases (mu- and m-calpain, respectively) is regulated in vivo by their association with a phosphatidylinositol-containing site on the plasma membrane followed by autolysis of the proteinases. Phosphatidylinositol association lowers the Ca2+ concentration needed for autolysis, and autolysis, in turn, lowers the Ca2+ concentration needed for proteolytic activity. To test this hypothesis, we have compared the Ca2+ concentrations needed for autolysis and for proteolytic activity of the calpains both in the presence and the absence of phosphatidylinositol. Bovine skeletal muscle mu-calpain required 40-50 microM Ca2+ for half-maximal rate of proteolysis of a casein substrate, 140-150 microM Ca2+ for half-maximal autolysis in the presence of 80 microM phosphatidylinositol, and 190-210 microM Ca2+ for half-maximal autolysis in the absence of phosphatidylinositol. Consequently, mu-calpain is an active proteinase and does not require autolysis for activation. Bovine skeletal muscle m-calpain required 700-740 microM Ca2+ for half-maximal rate of proteolysis of a casein substrate, 370-400 microM Ca2+ for half-maximal autolysis in the presence of 80 microM phosphatidylinositol, and 740-780 microM Ca2+ for half-maximal autolysis in the absence of phosphatidylinositol. These results are consistent with the idea that m-calpain functions in its autolyzed form, but the results do not demonstrate that unautolyzed m-calpain is inactive. 80 microM phosphatidylinositol had no effect on the Ca2+ requirement of the autolyzed forms of either mu- or m-calpain but lowered the specific activity of mu-calpain to 20% of its activity in the absence of phosphatidylinositol. Of the four forms of the calpains, unautolyzed m-calpain, autolyzed m-calpain, and unautolyzed mu-calpain would not be proteolytically active at the free Ca2+ concentrations of 300-1200 nM present inside normal cells, and neither mu- nor m-calpain would undergo autolysis at these Ca2+ concentrations, even in the presence of phosphatidylinositol. Cells must contain a mechanism other than or in addition to membrane association and autolysis to activate the calpains."
https://openalex.org/W1502005164,"Abstract Using site-directed mutagenesis of the human beta 2-adrenergic receptor and continuous expression in B-82 cells, the role of 3 conserved cysteines in transmembrane domains and 2 conserved cysteines in the third extracellular domain in receptor function was examined. Cysteine was replaced with serine in each mutant receptor as this amino acid is similar to cysteine in size but it cannot form disulfide linkages. Replacement of cysteine residues 77 and 327, in the second and seventh transmembrane-spanning domains, respectively, had no effect on ligand binding or the ability of the receptor to mediate isoproterenol stimulation of adenylate cyclase. Substitution of cysteine 285, in the sixth transmembrane domain of the receptor, produced a mutant receptor with normal ligand-binding properties but a significantly attenuated ability to mediate stimulation of adenylate cyclase. Mutation of cysteine residues 190 and 191, in the third extracellular loop of the beta 2 receptor, had qualitatively similar effects on ligand binding and isoproterenol-mediated stimulation of adenylate cyclase. Replacement of either of these residues with serine produced mutant receptors that displayed a marked loss in affinity for both beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists. Replacement of both cysteine 190 and 191 with serine had an even greater effect on the ability of the receptor to bind ligands. Consistent with the loss of Ser190 and/or Ser191 mutant receptor affinity for agonists was a corresponding shift to the right in the dose-response curve for isoproterenol-induced increases in intracellular cyclic AMP concentrations in cells expressing the mutant receptors. These data implicate one of the conserved transmembrane cysteine residues in the human beta 2-adrenergic receptor in receptor activation by agonists and also suggest that conserved cysteine residues in an extracellular domain of the receptor may be involved in ligand binding."
https://openalex.org/W1518205060,"Transcription of the gene for the cytosolic form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (EC 4.1.1.32) (PEPCK) from the rat is acutely regulated by a number of hormones, including glucagon (acting via cAMP), glucocorticoids, and insulin. In this study we demonstrate by DNase I footprinting that a region of the PEPCK promoter, extending from −460 to +73, contained eight protein binding domains. Two nuclear proteins protected adjacent sites from −121 to −99 and −96 to −77, which have been previously shown to be involved in maintaining the level of basal gene transcription and conferring cAMP responsiveness, respectively. Oligonucleotide competition studies suggested that the protein(s) binding to the cAMP-responsive element (CRE) occupies a second site at −147 to −130, which has a high degree of sequence homology to the CRE, and also binds to two other elements that show partial sequence homologies. The protein(s) which bound to these four elements copurified through oligonucleotide affinity chromatography, suggesting that the PEPCK promoter has four binding sites for the CRE-binding protein(s). Potential tissue-specific elements in the PEPCK promoter were identified by footprinting with nuclear extracts prepared from rat liver, kidney, brain, and spleen. The multiple protein-binding sites in this promoter-regulatory region reflect the complex transcriptional regulation that is characteristic of this gene."
https://openalex.org/W2076130750,"High-frequency (tetanic) stimulation of presynaptic nerve tracts in the hippocampal region of the brain can lead to long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP). Pertussis toxin prevented the development of tetanus-induced LTP in the stratum radiatum-CA1 synaptic system of rat hippocampal slices, indicating that a guanosine triphosphate-binding protein (G protein) may be required for the initiation of LTP. This G protein may be located at a site distinct from the postsynaptic neuron (that is, in presynaptic terminals or glial cells) since maximal activation of CA1 neuronal G proteins by intracellular injection of guanosine-5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), a nonhydrolyzable analog of guanosine 5′-triphosphate, did not occlude LTP."
https://openalex.org/W1480192557,"Primary cultures of rat choroid plexus epithelial cells were established and used to investigate the role of the choroid plexus in the synthesis and secretion of transferrin. Transferrin gene expression was determined by a Northern blot analysis with a transferrin cRNA probe. A single transferrin mRNA species was detected and found to be the same size as the transcripts in the liver and Sertoli cells. Immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled secreted proteins with an antiserum transferrin antibody demonstrated that cultured choroid plexus epithelial cells synthesize and secrete a 70-kDa species of transferrin. Levels of transferrin secretion by rat choroid plexus epithelial cells in culture were measured by radioimmunoassay. Treatment of the choroid plexus epithelial cells in culture with cell-permeable cAMP analogs or serotonin led to time- and concentration-dependent changes in the levels of transferrin in the medium. Dibutyryl-cAMP and 8-bromo-cAMP decreased the levels of transferrin synthesized and secreted by choroid plexus epithelial cells with an EC50 value of 30 nM. Serotonin, however, increased the levels of transferrin with an EC50 value of 100 nM. A concomitant change in transferrin mRNA concentrations was observed in response to serotonin. These data suggest that the synthesis of transferrin by the choroid plexus is reciprocally regulated by the neurotransmitter serotonin and by regulatory agents coupled to adenylate cyclase. Regulatory agents such as serotonin may have a critical role in modulating the proteins synthesized by the choroid plexus, thereby influencing the composition of the cerebrospinal fluid."
https://openalex.org/W1562657792,"Synthetic peptides, 14-16 residues in length, were used as substrates for purified recombinant poliovirus proteinase 3C. The sequences of the substrates correspond to the sequences of authentic cleavage sites in the poliovirus polyprotein, all of which contain Gln-Gly at the scissile bond. Specificity of cleavages was demonstrated by analysis of 3C digests of synthetic peptides. Relative rate constants for the cleavages were derived by competition experiments. The rate constants roughly correlated with the estimated half-life of the homologous precursor proteins detected in poliovirus-infected cells. The peptide most resistant to cleavage corresponded to the 3C/3D junction, a site known to be cleaved very slowly by 3C in vivo. Substitution of threonine for alanine in P4 position of this peptide, however, resulted in significant cleavage. This observation supports the hypothesis that the residue in P4 position, in addition to the Gln-Gly in P1 and P1', respectively, contributes to substrate recognition. Ac-Gln-Gly-NH2 was not a substrate for 3C."
https://openalex.org/W2151008793,"The biogenesis of cytochrome c1 involves a number of steps including: synthesis as a precursor with a bipartite signal sequence, transfer across the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes, removal of the first part of the presequence in the matrix, reexport to the outer surface of the inner membrane, covalent addition of heme, and removal of the remainder of the presequence. In this report we have focused on the steps of heme addition, catalyzed by cytochrome c1 heme lyase, and of proteolytic processing during cytochrome c1 import into mitochondria. Following translocation from the matrix side to the intermembrane-space side of the inner membrane, apocytochrome c1 forms a complex with cytochrome c1 heme lyase, and then holocytochrome c1 formation occurs. Holocytochrome c1 formation can also be observed in detergent-solubilized preparations of mitochondria, but only after apocytochrome c1 has first interacted with cytochrome c1 heme lyase to produce this complex. Heme linkage takes place on the intermembrane-space side of the inner mitochondrial membrane and is dependent on NADH plus a cytosolic cofactor that can be replaced by flavin nucleotides. NADH and FMN appear to be necessary for reduction of heme prior to its linkage to apocytochrome c1. The second proteolytic processing of cytochrome c1 does not take place unless the covalent linkage of heme to apocytochrome c1 precedes it. On the other hand, the cytochrome c1 heme lyase reaction itself does not require that processing of the cytochrome c1 precursor to intermediate size cytochrome c1 takes place first. In conclusion, cytochrome c1 heme lyase catalyzes an essential step in the import pathway of cytochrome c1, but it is not involved in the transmembrane movement of the precursor polypeptide. This is in contrast to the case for cytochrome c in which heme addition is coupled to its transport directly across the outer membrane into the intermembrane space."
https://openalex.org/W1673706048,"Abstract Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies was employed in order to study insulin-dependent protein tyrosine phosphorylation in intact Fao cells. In insulin-treated cells, a prominent 180-kDa protein underwent tyrosine phosphorylation, which peaked at 45 s and then rapidly declined. Pretreatment of the cells with 1 mM Bt2cAMP or 0.16 microM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate inhibited the insulin-dependent phosphorylation of pp 180, while 1 mM vanadate or 3 mM H2O2 markedly potentiated it. These results indicate that phosphorylation of pp 180 is respectively regulated by agents that are known to synergize with or antagonize the action of the insulin receptor kinase. pp 180 is therefore likely to mediate physiological functions of this receptor kinase. Incubation of Fao cells with 3 mM H2O2 for 30 min prior to their treatment with insulin for 45 s allowed the detection of additional, previously undescribed, proteins pp 150, 114, 100, 85, 68, and 56 kDa that underwent insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation. The potentiating effects of H2O2 were time- and dose-dependent and could be reversed by 2 mM dithiothreitol. Proteins phosphorylated in response to H2O2 plus insulin maintained their fully phosphorylated state for at least 20 min. We suggest that these phosphoproteins are potential physiological substrates for the insulin receptor kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1592483093,"Like many intercalative antitumor drugs, the nonintercalative antitumor drug epipodophyllotoxin VM-26 (teniposide) induces topoisomerase II-linked DNA breaks as revealed by cell lysis with a strong protein denaturant such as sodium dodecyl sulfate or alkali. We show that the majority of topoisomerase II-linked DNA breaks reflect the formation of reversible topoisomerase II-DNA cleavable complexes in drug-treated cells by demonstrating the reversibility of this unusual type of DNA damage at elevated temperatures (e.g. 65 °C)."
https://openalex.org/W2131888544,"Abstract The binding of [3H]aldosterone in the chick intestine cytosol was analyzed in terms of affinity and specificity. In this tissue, aldosterone binds to the mineralocorticosteroid receptor, with a high affinity (Kd approximately 0.3 nM) and low capacity (approximately 50 fmol/mg protein), and to the glucocorticosteroid receptor. The selective labeling of the mineralocorticosteroid receptor was achieved by incubating the cytosol with [3H]aldosterone in the presence of RU 486. This synthetic steroid completely inhibited the binding of [3H]aldosterone to the glucocorticosteroid receptor and did not bind to the mineralocorticosteroid receptor. The oligomeric structure of the mineralocorticosteroid receptor was studied by using BF4, a monoclonal antibody which reacts with the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp 90), a nonhormone-binding component of nontransformed steroid receptors. The mineralocorticosteroid receptor sedimented at 8.5 +/- 0.4 S (n = 8) in a 15-40% glycerol gradient. This peak was shifted to 11.2 +/- 0.6 S (n = 5) after incubation with BF4, indicating that, in the cytosol, hsp 90 was associated with the mineralocorticosteroid receptor. Dissociation of the complex was observed on gradients containing 0.4 M KCl, as judged by the absence of displacement by BF4 of the 4.3 +/- 0.4 S (n = 10) peak. The effect of molybdate and tungstate ions, and of dimethyl pimelimidate, an irreversible cross-linking agent, on the stability of the hsp 90-receptor complex was investigated. Complexes recovered in the presence of 20 mM molybdate ions dissociated on gradients containing 0.4 M KCl (5.2 +/- 0.6 S (n = 4), whereas complexes prepared in the presence of 20 mM tungstate ions sedimented at 8.5 +/- 0.4 S (n = 7). Similarly, complexes prepared in the presence of molybdate ions dissociated during high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) gel filtration analysis performed in 0.4 M KCl (RS (Stokes radius) = 3.9 +/- 0.5 nm (n = 3) versus 7.3 +/- 0.2 nm (n = 3) in the presence of 20 mM molybdate ions), whereas complexes prepared in the presence of tungstate ions did not dissociate (RS = 6.9 +/- 0.2 nm (n = 3]. As observed for the tungstate-stabilized receptor, the cross-linked receptor dissociated neither on gradient containing 0.4 M KCl (9.5 +/- 0.1 S (n = 3] nor during HPLC performed in 0.4 M KCl (RS = 6.5 +/- 0.3 (n = 4]. Furthermore, the cross-linked receptor was more resistant to the inactivating effect of urea on aldosterone binding than the noncross-linked receptor prepared in the presence of either molybdate or tungstate ions."
https://openalex.org/W2071615455,"Specialized regions of muscle fibers may result from differential gene expression within a single fiber. In order to investigate the range of action of individual nuclei in multinucleated myotubes, C2 myoblasts were transfected to obtain stable cell lines that express a reporter protein that is targeted to the nucleus. Hybrid myotubes were then formed containing one or a few transfected nuclei as well as a large number of nuclei from the parental strain. In order to determine how far the products of a single nucleus extend, transfected nuclei were labeled with [3H]thymidine before fusion and the myotubes were stained to identify the reporter protein. In such myotubes the fusion protein was not confined to its nucleus of origin, but was restricted to nearby nuclei."
https://openalex.org/W1489376146,"Abstract To determine whether equilibrium binding between and hepatocytes involves a cell surface receptor for albumin, we incubated freshly isolated rat hepatocytes with 125I-albumin and determined the amount of associated with the cells as a function of the total concentration. The resulting two-phase binding curve showed the rat albumin-hepatocyte interaction to consist of a saturable binding interaction with a dissociation constant of 1.1 microM and 2 X 10(6) sites/cell in addition to a weak, nonsaturable binding interaction. However, the saturable binding of to hepatocytes did not appear to result from the presence of an receptor on the cell surface; the interaction was the same for different species of albumin, for chemically modified albumins, and for fragments of representing mutually exclusive domains of the molecule. The saturable binding was, instead, found to involve a subpopulation of with an enhanced affinity for the cell surface. We show that this subpopulation of is generated upon contact with either solid surfaces or cell surfaces and can be transferred from one surface to another. We propose that the two-phase Scatchard binding curve and the albumin receptor effect reflect two populations of that bind to the cell surface with different affinities rather than one population of that binds to two classes of binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1562909136,"Abstract Platelet function is inhibited by agents such as prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) that elevate the cytoplasmic concentration of cyclic AMP. Inhibition presumably results from the cyclic AMP-stimulated phosphorylation of intracellular proteins. Polypeptides that become phosphorylated are actin-binding protein, P51 (Mr = 51,000), P36 (Mr = 36,000), P24 (Mr = 24,000), and P22 (Mr = 22,000). Recently, we identified P24 as the beta-chain of glycoprotein (GP) Ib, a component of the plasma membrane GP Ib.IX complex. The existence of Bernard-Soulier syndrome, a hereditary disorder in which platelets selectively lack the GP Ib.IX complex, enabled us to examine whether the phosphorylation of GP Ib beta (P24) is responsible for any of the inhibitory effects of elevated cyclic AMP on platelet function. Exposure of control platelets to PGE1 increased phosphorylation of actin-binding protein, P51, P36, GP Ib beta, and P22. Prostaglandin E1 induced the same phosphorylation reactions in Bernard-Soulier platelets, except that of GP Ib beta, which is absent. In control platelets, PGE1 inhibited collagen-induced phosphorylation of myosin light chain, phosphorylation of P47 (an unidentified Mr 47,000 cytoplasmic protein that is phosphorylated by protein kinase C in stimulated platelets), aggregation, and the secretion of granule contents. Despite the absence of GP Ib beta, PGE1 also inhibited these collagen-induced responses in Bernard-Soulier platelets. However, while PGE1 inhibited collagen-induced polymerization of actin in control platelets, it did not inhibit actin polymerization in Bernard-Soulier platelets. These results suggest that cyclic AMP-induced phosphorylation of GP Ib inhibits collagen-induced actin polymerization in platelets. Because actin polymerization is required for at least some of the functional responses of platelets to an agonist, phosphorylation of Gp Ib beta may be one way in which cyclic AMP inhibits platelet function."
https://openalex.org/W1676414257,"Abstract The interaction between eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I and a high affinity binding sequence was investigated. Quantitative footprint analysis demonstrated that the substrate preference results from strong specific binding of topoisomerase I to the sequence. The specificity was conferred by a tight noncovalent association between the enzyme and its target DNA, whereas the transient formation of a covalently bound enzyme.nicked DNA intermediate contributed insignificantly to the overall affinity. Topoisomerase I protected both strands over a 20-base pair region in which the cleavage site was centrally located. DNA modification interference analysis revealed a 16-base pair interference region on the scissile strand. Essential bases were confined to the 5' side of the cleavage site. The 6-base pair interference region observed on the complementary strand did not contain essential bases."
https://openalex.org/W1596879323,"Abstract Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is stored in atrial myocytes as a prohormone (ANF-(1-126] and is cosecretionally processed to the circulating ANF-related peptides, ANF-(1-98) and ANF-(99-126). Recently, we have shown that the cosecretional processing of ANF can be replicated in primary cultures of neonatal rat atrial myocytes maintained under serum-free conditions and that glucocorticoids are responsible for supporting this processing activity. Activators of protein kinase C (phorbol esters and alpha-adrenergic agonists) and of protein kinase A (cAMP analogs, forskolin, and beta-adrenergic agonists) were tested for their abilities to alter the rate of ANF secretion from the primary cultures. ANF secretion was stimulated approximately 4-fold after a 1-h incubation of the cultures with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA); maximal release occurred at about 100 nM TPA. Reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography analysis of secreted material indicated that the cells efficiently cosecretionally processed ANF under both basal and TPA-stimulated conditions. However, incubating the cultures for more than 1 h with TPA resulted in a blunted secretory response to further TPA challenge and a 40-50% decrease in the quantity of ANF in the cells. The alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine was also capable of stimulating ANF secretion by about 4-fold at a half-maximal dose of about 1 microM. Phenylephrine-stimulated ANF secretion was inhibited by the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin with half-maximal inhibition occurring at approximately 1 nM. Forskolin, 8-bromoadenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate, and N6-2(1)-O-dibutyryladenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate inhibited basal, TPA- and phenylephrine-stimulated ANF secretion. The beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol partially inhibited phenylephrine-stimulated ANF secretion with the maximal effect occurring at 1 nM. These results indicate that ANF secretion from the neonatal rat atrial cultures is enhanced by activators of protein kinase C, and decreased by activators of protein kinase A, and that these secretory effects may be mediated through the actions of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1533006219,"Abstract The kinetic properties of 50,000-fold purified cultured human T lymphoblast (MOLT-4) deoxycytidine kinase were examined. The reaction velocity had an absolute requirement for magnesium. Maximal activity was observed at pH 6.5-7.0 with Mg:ATP for 1:1. High concentrations of free Mg2+ or free ATP were inhibitory. Double reciprocal plots of initial velocity studies yielded intersecting lines for both deoxycytidine and MgATP2-. dCMP was a competitive inhibitor with respect to deoxycytidine and ATP. ADP was a competitive inhibitor with respect to ATP and a mixed inhibitor with respect to deoxycytidine. dCTP, an important end product, is a very potent inhibitor and was a competitive inhibitor with respect to deoxycytidine and a non-competitive inhibitor with respect to ATP. TTP reversed dCTP inhibition. The data suggest that (a) MgATP2- is the true substrate of deoxycytidine kinase; (b) the kinetic mechanism of deoxycytidine kinase is consistent with rapid equilibrium random Bi Bi; (c) deoxycytidine kinase may be regulated by its product ADP and its end product dCTP as well as the availability of deoxycytidine. While many different nucleotides potently inhibit deoxycytidine kinase, their low intracellular concentrations make their regulatory role less important."

Binding of 125I-EDF to F5-5 cells is time- and temperature-dependent, specific, saturable, and reversible. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 has no significant effects on growth of F5-5 cells and binding of 125I-EDF to F5-5 cells. Scatchard analysis of the binding data indicated that F5-5 cells have a single class of binding sites (3,200/cell) with an apparent Kd of 3.1 X 10(-10) M. Affinity cross-linking experiments demonstrated three radiolabeled components of 140,000, 76,000, and 67,000 daltons under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. Labeling of these three components has been inhibited by incubation of the cells with excess unlabeled EDF. These results imply molecular weights of 115,000, 51,000, and 42,000 for the EDF receptors on this cell line."
https://openalex.org/W1602098131,"Using Triton X-100/lipid mixed micellar methods, we observed that the adriamycin-iron(III) complex was a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C while uncomplexed adriamycin itself was a poor inhibitor in the absence of heavy metal contaminants. The 3:1 adriamycin-iron complex was more potent than 2:1, 1:1, and 1:0 complexes. Inhibition of protein kinase C was reversible, and 50% inhibition occurred at 13 microM (adriamycin)3Fe3+. Both the catalytic and the regulatory domain of protein kinase C were affected by adriamycin-iron(III). Adriamycin-iron(III) was a competitive inhibitor of the catalytic domain of protein kinase C with respect to MgATP but not with respect to magnesium (IC50 350 microM). The predominant interaction of adriamycin-iron(III) with native protein kinase C was as a competitive inhibitor with respect to diacylglycerol. Inhibition was not competitive with respect to phosphatidylserine, calcium, magnesium, MgATP, or histone. Interaction with the regulatory domain was demonstrated by the ability of adriamycin-iron(III) to inhibit phorbol dibutyrate binding. Other adriamycin transitional metal complexes showed little inhibition of protein kinase C activity. Acetylation of the amine on the daunosamine moeity of adriamycin did not preclude the formation of a ferric complex but resulted in total loss of inhibitory activity. These results suggest that the presence of free amines in a highly structured adriamycin-iron complex is necessary for inhibition. The implications of inhibition of protein kinase C by adriamycin-iron(III) are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1548707418,"The prsA1 allele, specifying a mutant Escherichia coli phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase, has been cloned. The mutation was shown by nucleotide sequence analysis to result from substitution of Asp-128 (GAT) in the wild type by Ala (GCT) in prsA1. This alteration was confirmed by chemical determination of the amino acid sequence of a tryptic peptide derived from the purified mutant enzyme. The mutation lies at the N-terminal end of a 16 residue sequence that is highly conserved in E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, and rat PRPP synthetases and has the following consensus sequence: DLHAXQIQGFFDI/VPI/VD. There was little alteration in the Km for ribose 5-phosphate. The Km for ATP of the mutant enzyme was increased 27-fold when Mg2+ was the activating cation but only 5-fold when Mn2+ was used. Maximal velocities of the wild type and mutant enzymes were the same. The mutant enzyme has a 6-fold lower affinity for Ca2+, as judged by the ability of Ca2+ to inhibit the reaction in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+. Wild type PRPP synthetase is subject to product inhibition by AMP, but AMP inhibition of the prsA1 mutant enzyme could not be detected. It has been previously proposed that a divalent cation binds to PRPP synthetase and serves as a bridge to the alpha-phosphate of ATP and AMP at the active site. The prsA1 mutation appears to alter this divalent cation site."
https://openalex.org/W1496404255,"Abstract We have extended these observations to examine the role of polylysine on the divalent metal ion requirement for ligand-stimulated protein kinase activity and the transmembrane signaling mechanism of both the human placenta insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptors. Polylysine (0.2-1 microM) was found to activate maximally the alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric insulin receptor autophosphorylation and exogenous substrate protein kinase activity 25-50-fold in the presence of insulin without significantly affecting the basal protein kinase activity in the absence of insulin. The polylysine-dependent insulin stimulation of protein kinase activity required the presence of both magnesium and manganese but at relatively low divalent metal ion concentrations (0.1 mM) compared to the typical 2-10 mM Mg/Mn used in the standard in vitro kinase assays. The stimulation of the insulin receptor kinase by insulin in the presence of polylysine occurred primarily due to an increase in Vmax with no significant effect on the Km for ATP. In addition, autophosphorylated insulin receptors which are protein kinase-active and insulin-independent at high metal ion concentrations still displayed the polylysine-dependent insulin stimulation of protein kinase activity to the same extent as nonphosphorylated insulin receptors at low Mg/Mn (0.1 mM) concentrations. Surprisingly, polylysine was completely unable to stimulate the IGF-1-dependent protein kinase activity of the homologous human placenta IGF-1 receptor. These data suggest that the insulin receptor tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity may be regulated by unique endogenous basic proteins that are distinct from those which modify the IGF-1 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1499372908,"Abstract The kinetics of [3H]inositol phosphate metabolism in agonist-activated rat parotid acinar cells were characterized in order to determine the sources of [3H]inositol monophosphates and [3H]inositol bisphosphates. The turnover rates of D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and its metabolites, D-myo-inositol 1,4-bisphosphate and D-myo-inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, were examined following the addition of the muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine, to cholinergically stimulated parotid cells. D-myo-Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate declined with a t1/2 of 7.6 +/- 0.7 s, D-myo-inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate declined with a t1/2 of 8.6 +/- 1.2 min, and D-myo-inositol 1,4-bisphosphate was metabolized with a t1/2 of 6.0 +/- 0.7 min. The sum of the rates of flux through D-myo-inositol 1,4-bisphosphate and D-myo-inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (2.54% phosphatidylinositol/min) did not exceed the calculated rate of breakdown of D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (2.76% phosphatidylinositol/min). Thus, there is no evidence for the direct hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate in intact cells since D-myo-inositol 1,4-bisphosphate formation can be attributed to the dephosphorylation of D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. The source of the [3H]inositol monophosphates also was examined in cholinergically stimulated parotid cells. When parotid cells were stimulated with methacholine, D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, D-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, D-myo-inositol 1,4-bisphosphate, and D-myo-inositol 4-monophosphate levels increased within 2 s, whereas D-myo-inositol 1-monophosphate accumulation was delayed by several seconds. Rates of [3H]inositol monophosphate accumulation also were examined by the addition of LiCl to cells stimulated to steady state levels of [3H]inositol phosphates. The sum of the rates of accumulation of D-myo-inositol 1-monophosphate and D-myo-inositol 4-monophosphate did not exceed the rate of breakdown of D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate or the sum of the rates of flux through D-myo-inositol 1,4-bisphosphate and D-myo-inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate. These kinetic analyses suggest that agonist-stimulated [3H]inositol bis- and monophosphate formation in intact rat parotid acinar cells can be accounted for by the metabolism of D-myo-[3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate rather than by phospholipase C-catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol or phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1844500634,"Abstract At late times after infection with SV40, a prematurely terminated transcript that initiates at the major late promoter (MLP) and has a 3'-end about 95 nucleotides downstream has been identified and termed an attenuated RNA (Hay, N., Skolnik-David, H., and Aloni, Y. (1982) Cell 29, 183-193). The DNA template of the attenuated RNA has two regions of dyad symmetry, and the attenuated RNA can therefore fold into two hairpin elements. The hairpin element at the 3'-end of the attenuated RNA is followed by a stretch of Us and resembles a rho-independent terminator in prokaryotes. We have suggested that folding of the RNA into two hairpin elements will lead to a block of transcription elongation. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we created two templates that either strengthened or weakened the proposed hairpin structures. The mutated and wild-type templates were cloned downstream from the adenovirus 2 MLP, and transcription patterns were compared between the templates in a cell-free extract. We have shown that RNA polymerase II recognizes the SV40 sequence that leads to a block of transcription elongation, even when it is under the control of the MLP of adenovirus 2. The extent of the block of transcription elongation is directly dependent on the stability of the hairpin structure of the RNA as assessed by a comparison of transcription of the wild-type and mutated templates. The addition of Sarkosyl and transcription at an elevated temperature during the elongation reaction enhanced the production of the attenuated RNA from all templates."
https://openalex.org/W1675223760,"RNA triphosphatase, RNA guanylyltransferase, RNA (guanine-7)-methyltransferase, and transcription termination factor activities are associated with the mRNA capping enzyme from vaccinia virus. Purified vaccinia capping enzyme is a 6.5 S protein containing two subunits of Mr = 95,000 and Mr = 31,000. Although the RNA guanylyltransferase domain has been localized to the large subunit by virtue of the formation of a Mr = 95,000 covalent protein-GMP intermediate, the location of other functional domains within the protein and the catalytic role of individual subunits remain unclear. In the present study, limited proteolysis with trypsin was shown to convert the vaccinia capping enzyme into a form capable of generating a Mr = 59,000 enzyme-GMP complex. Purification of the trypsinized enzyme by glycerol gradient sedimentation resulted in the isolation of a 4.2 S fragment of the large subunit that retains RNA triphosphatase and RNA guanylyltransferase activities. This derivative, containing little or no small subunit (or fragments thereof), has lost the ability to catalyze methyl group transfer and to mediate transcription termination in vitro. Residual methyltransferase activity was found associated with a minor 5.2 S tryptic product that cosediments with a Mr = 21,000 fragment of the small enzyme subunit. A model for the organization of functional domains within the capping enzyme is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1549146371,"Fructose-6-phosphate,2-kinase:fructose-2,6-bis-phosphatase from rat skeletal muscle has been purified to homogeneity, and its structure and kinetic properties have been determined. The Mr of the native enzyme was 100,000 and the subunit Mr was 54,000. The apparent Km values of fructose-6-P,2-kinase for Fru-6-P and ATP were 56 and 48 microM, respectively. The apparent Km value for Fru-2,6-P2 of fructose-2,6-bis-phosphatase was 0.4 microM, and the Ki for Fru-6-P was 12.5 microM. The enzyme was bifunctional, and the phosphatase activity was 2.5 times higher than the kinase activity. The enzyme was not phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The amino acid composition of the skeletal muscle enzyme was similar to that of the rat liver enzyme, and the carboxyl terminus sequence (His-Tyr) was the same as that of the liver enzyme. The tryptic peptides generated from the liver and skeletal muscle enzymes were identical except for two peptides. A peptide corresponding to nucleotides 14-28 of the rat liver enzyme was not detected in the skeletal muscle enzyme. A peptide whose amino acid sequence was Thr-Ala-Ser-Ile-Pro-Gln-Phe-Thr-Asn-Ser-Pro-Thr-Met-Val-Ile-Met-Val-Gly-Leu-Pro - Ala-Arg was also isolated. This peptide was the same as that of rat liver enzyme (nucleotides 31-52) containing the phosphorylation site except in the muscle enzyme two amino terminus amino acids, Gly-Ser(P), have been altered to Thr-Ala. Thus, the rat skeletal muscle enzyme is very similar in structure to the rat liver enzyme except for the lack of possibly one peptide and the lack of a phosphorylation site by the substitution of the target Ser with Ala."
https://openalex.org/W1552527636,"Abstract Hepatic triglyceride lipase (H-TGL) is a key lipolytic enzyme in the metabolism of human plasma high density lipoproteins. The enzyme is bound to glycosaminoglycans on endothelial cells in the liver and is immediately released into the circulation after heparin administration. In addition to releasing H-TGL, heparin-like glycosaminoglycans have also been shown to suppress hepatocyte proliferation and to alter tissue-specific gene expression. In the present study, the effects of heparin exposure on the secretion of H-TGL were examined in a human parenchymal hepatoma (HepG2) cell line. The addition of heparin to serum-supplemented medium induced the secretion of H-TGL in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. At 5.4 micrograms/ml heparin, H-TGL levels, as determined by triacyglycerol hydrolase activity, increased 7-fold after a 44-h incubation. Heparin exposure decreased intracellular H-TGL activity from 21.3 to 4.8 nmol of oleic acids released/h/10(8) cells and increased enzyme activity in the medium from 16.2 to 165.3 nmol of oleic acids released/h/10(8) cells. The heparin-induced secretion of H-TGL was associated with increased levels of H-TGL-specific mRNA. The addition of actinomycin D or cycloheximide reversed the heparin-induced increase in H-TGL activity and mRNA. Heparin treatment did not increase the level of actin mRNA suggesting that elevated H-TGL mRNA is due to enhanced tissue-specific expression of H-TGL. Expression of apolipoprotein E, another protein involved in lipoprotein metabolism, also showed induced levels of mRNA by heparin but to a lesser extent than that for H-TGL. We conclude that heparin stimulates the de novo synthesis of H-TGL in liver parenchymal cells in vivo by influencing both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events."
https://openalex.org/W1485065849,"Abstract The effect of amiloride on the hormonal regulation of adenylate cyclase was studied in the rat anterior pituitary. The diuretic did not alter basal adenylate cyclase but augmented the enzyme activity in an irreversible manner in the presence of guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) stimulated adenylate cyclase at lower concentrations and inhibited at higher concentrations. Amiloride treatment enhanced the stimulatory and abolished the inhibitory phase of GTP gamma S action. In addition, amiloride also attenuated the inhibitory effects of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF 99-126) and angiotensin II on cAMP levels and adenylate cyclase activity. On the other hand, amiloride showed an additive effect on the stimulation exerted by corticotropin-releasing factor and vasoactive intestinal peptide on adenylate cyclase in anterior pituitary and on isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP levels in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. Pertussis toxin, in the presence of [alpha-32 P]NAD, catalyzed the ADP-ribosylation of two protein bands of Mr 41,000 and 39,000, referred to as Gi and Go, respectively, in the anterior pituitary, and 40,000-Da protein in the aorta, referred to as Gi. Amiloride treatment inhibited the labeling of all these bands in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Similarly, the pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of purified Gi from bovine brain was also inhibited by amiloride treatment. However, amiloride had no significant effect on the cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gs. These data suggest that amiloride interacts with the guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins Gi and Go. Modification of Gi results in the attenuation of hormone-induced adenylate cyclase and cAMP inhibition. However, the interaction between amiloride and Go and the consequent Ca2+ mobilization and phosphatidylinositol turnover have to be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W1544186447,"A method for detecting a wide variety of mutations within type I collagen has been developed and evaluated on a series of patients with osteogenesis imperfecta. RNA, extracted from the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartment of cultured fibroblasts from affected individuals, is hybridized with antisense single-stranded cDNA to the α1(I) mRNA. The hybrid is digested with RNase A and T1 under varying degrees of stringency. The resistant RNA bands are separated by electrophoresis in agarose, transferred to nitrocellulose, and hybridized with antisense cRNA colinear with the protecting probe. This approach is capable of detecting previously defined mutations such as 252-base pair deletion and a 1-base pair mismatch within the α1(I) mRNA. The method appears to be particularly useful in detecting abnormalities of RNA processing that behave as an insert or deletion within the mature mRNA. The procedure should be generally applicable for the identification and localization of any mutation within an entire gene if the gene is expressed as an RNA and a complete cDNA for the mRNA is available."
https://openalex.org/W1567600795,"Adenylate kinase deficiency in the erythrocyte is a rare genetic disorder associated with hemolytic anemia. To determine the molecular basis of this disorder, we first cloned the normal gene encoding human cytosolic adenylate kinase (AK1) and determined the structure. The gene was 12 kilobase pairs long and was split into 7 exons. The structures of 5'- and 3'-flanking regions were determined by primer extension and RNA blot analysis. The results showed that two species of mRNA with 0.9 and 2.5 kilobases, which differed at the 3'-end portion, were generated by the AK1 gene. Alu sequences were found in the largest intron (intron 5) and in the noncoding region of exon 7. Next, both alleles of the AK1 gene were cloned from DNA of a patient bearing the adenylate kinase deficiency and their nucleotide sequences determined. A transition (C----T) was found in exon 6 on an allele, which resulted in an Arg to Trp (CGG----TGG) substitution at the 128th residue of AK1. Since chicken AK1 is highly homologous to human AK1 with respect to the amino acid sequence, we introduced an Arg to Trp substitution to chicken AK1 at the same position by oligodeoxynucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The mutant chicken AK1 expressed in Escherichia coli showed a reduced catalytic activity as well as a decreased solubility and a change in affinity to phosphocellulose. Thus it was considered that the observed C----T transition was a cause of the decreased AK1 activity of the patient's erythrocyte. Analysis on phosphocellulose chromatography of erythrocyte AK1 of the patient and parents revealed that the patient's mutant allele was derived from the mother."

Both precursor proteins are posttranslationally processed and exported into the periplasm, and they both depend on the membrane potential for this to occur. With respect to dependence on components of the export machinery, however, the two precursor proteins show striking differences: the small precursor protein prepromelittin does not require the function of proteins secA and secY; the large precursor protein prepromelittin-dihydrofolate reductase, on the other hand, depends on both components. The implications of these observations with respect to the mechanisms of protein export in E. coli and of protein import into the endoplasmic reticulum are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1510961347,"Proton NMR studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (bakers yeast) isozyme-1 monomer and dimer ferricytochrome c have been carried out. The dimer is formed via a disulfide bridge between the Cys-102 residues of monomer proteins. Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) experiments have led to resonance assignments for many of the heme and axial ligand (Met-80; His-18) protons in both protein forms. Resonances of the following amino acids have also been assigned in both forms: Phe-10; Pro-30; Phe-82; Trp-59; Leu-68. The proton NOE connectivity patterns of the monomer of yeast isozyme-1 ferricytochrome c are similar to those of horse, tuna, and yeast isozyme-2 ferricytochromes c, even though the observed hyperfine resonance spectra are significantly different for the various cytochromes. The pattern of dimer proton hyperfine resonances is distinct from the isozyme-1 monomer pattern, which indicates that the formation of a disulfide bridge via Cys-102 is detected at the heme site, approximately 10 A distant. It appears that a specific structural change is induced upon dimerization, which, in turn, causes specific perturbations in the vicinity of the heme. However, the general features of the NOE connectivity pattern in the dimer are the same as for the monomer indicating that dimerization does not result in drastic structural disruption. Furthermore, the 1H NMR spectrum of the dimer can be mimicked by the monomer form that results when the -SH group of Cys-102 is chemically modified with certain types of bulky, or hydrophilic reagents (i.e. 5,5'-dithiobis[2-nitrobenzoate], indicating that perturbations of the yeast isozyme-1 ferricytochrome c proton resonance spectrum observed upon dimerization are essentially due to changes in intramolecular, rather than intermolecular, interactions. These results suggest that a possible regulatory site for yeast isozyme-1 cytochrome c exists at position 102, which could conceivably have a physiological role in altering the conformation of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1554030738,"Abstract Subunit II of yeast cytochrome c oxidase is synthesized on mitochondrial ribosomes as a precursor containing a transient NH2-terminal presequence and is inserted into the mitochondrial inner membrane from the matrix side. Using an optimized in vitro mitochondrial translation system (McKee, E.E., and Poyton, R. O. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 9320-9331), we have examined the requirement for an electrochemical potential (delta mu H+) across the inner mitochondrial membrane during subunit II biogenesis. When mitochondrial gene products are synthesized under conditions that prevent formation of a normal delta mu H+, accumulation of unprocessed subunit II (pre-II) occurs. The majority of pre-II generated in this way is inserted into the lipid bilayer, as judged by resistance to extraction with 0.1 M Na2CO3. Therefore, it appears that a delta mu H+ is required for the normal biogenesis of subunit II, and that the delta mu H+ is required for a function other than the insertion of pre-II into the lipid bilayer of the inner membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1579846509,"Abstract The fluorescence of Trp-226 in the regulatory subunit of bovine type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is unaffected by the binding of cAMP, but is quenched by the binding of 2'-dansyl-cAMP (DNS-cAMP). Up to 67% of the fluorescence of Trp-226 can be quenched by resonant energy transfer to the DNS-cAMP bound to the first site, and 96% of the fluorescence can be quenched by saturating both sites with DNS-cAMP. The observed efficiencies of energy transfer gave a distance of 16 A between Trp-226 and the DNS-cAMP bound at the first site and a distance of 12.7 A between Trp-226 and the DNS-cAMP bound at second site. The fluorescence of Trp-226 was suppressed by incubation of RII with the self-complementary octanucleotide TGACGTCA (CRE) due to binding of the oligonucleotide to RII. A detailed study of the binding equilibrium showed that each RII(cAMP)2 molecule binds 1 molecule of CRE with Kd = 80 nM. The corresponding Kd value for cAMP-depleted RII was found to be 25-fold higher. RII was also found to bind randomly selected DNA fragments with an average Kd value much higher than that of CRE. These observations show for the first time that the binding of oligonucleotide to RII is cAMP-enhanced and sequence-selective."

The result indicates that the ATP sulfurylase.APS complex does not serve as a for APS kinase, i.e. there is no substrate channeling of APS between the two sulfate-activating enzymes. APS kinase had no effect on the [S]0.5 values, nH values, or maximum isotope trapping in the single turnover of ATP sulfurylase-bound [35S]APS. Equimolar APS kinase (+/- MgATP or APS) also had no effect on the rate constants for the inactivation of ATP sulfurylase by phenylglyoxal, diethylpyrocarbonate, or N-ethylmaleimide. Similarly, ATP sulfurylase (+/- ligands) had no effect on the inactivation of equimolar APS kinase by trinitrobenzene sulfonate, diethylpyrocarbonate, or heat. (The last promotes the dissociation of dimeric APS kinase to inactive monomers.) ATP sulfurylase also had no effect on the reassociation of APS kinase subunits at low temperature. The cumulative results suggest that the two sulfate activating enzymes do not associate to form a 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate synthetase complex."

Each component of the cell-free system (myeloperoxidase, H2O2, iodide) or neutrophil system (neutrophils, phorbol ester, iodide) was required in order to observe these changes. In the cell-free system, the H2O2 requirement was fulfilled by either reagent H2O2 or the peroxide-generating system glucose oxidase plus glucose. Both loss of iron binding capacity and transferrin iodination by either the myeloperoxidase system or activated neutrophils were blocked by azide or catalase.

https://openalex.org/W1541395840,"The human gene coding for porphobilinogen deaminase (PBG-D) is transcribed into two distinct transcription units giving two mRNAs. These units originate from two adjacent promoters distant of 3 kilobase pairs. The upstream promoter is active in all cell types, whereas the downstream promoter is active only in erythroid cells. We have studied the expression of this gene either after introduction of the corresponding human chromosome into murine erythroid cells using somatic hybrids or after transfection into both erythroid and non-erythroid cells. Using somatic hybrids, we showed that activation of the erythroid-specific promoter of the PBG-D gene did not reduce the rate of initiation of the ubiquitous promoter. Transfection experiments in erythroid cells showed that the PBG-D erythroid transcription unit, controlled by the PBG-D erythroid promoter, was correctly transcribed and regulated. Furthermore, we found that the PBG-D erythroid promoter alone was sufficient for correct expression and regulation of a reporter gene during erythroid differentiation. When the human PBG-D gene was transfected into non-erythroid cells, only the ubiquitous promoter was active. Deletion of the ubiquitous promoter did not lead to any activation of the erythroid promoter, suggesting that its inactivity in non-erythroid cells was not due to promoter occlusion but to a strict erythroid specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1659091836,"The mechanisms that regulate collagen gene expression in hepatic cells are poorly understood. Accelerated Ca2+ fluxes are associated with inhibiting collagen synthesis selectively in human fibroblasts (Flaherty, M., and Chojkier, M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 12060-12065). In suspension cultures of isolated hepatocytes, the Ca2+ agonist vasopressin increases cytosolic levels of free Ca2+ (Thomas, A.P., Marks, J.S., Coll, K.E., and Williamson, J. R. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 5716-5725). However, whether vasopressin's interactions with plasma membrane V1 receptors attenuate hepatic collagen production is unknown. We investigated this problem by studying vasopressin's effects on collagen synthesis and Ca2+ efflux in long-term primary cultures of differentiated and proliferation-competent adult rat hepatocytes. Twelve-day-old quiescent cultures were exposed to test substances and labeled with [5-3H]proline. Determinations of radioactivity in collagenase-sensitive and collagenase-resistant proteins were used to calculate the relative levels of collagen production. Synthetic [8-arg]vasopressin stimulated 45Ca2+ efflux within 1 min and inhibited hepatocyte collagen production within 3 h by 50%; overall rates of protein synthesis were not affected significantly. In cultures labeled with [35S]methionine, vasopressin also decreased the levels of newly synthesized and secreted albumin, but not fibrinogen, detected in specific immunoprecipitates analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Northern blot analyses using specific [32P]cDNA probes revealed 70% decreases in hybridizable levels of collagen alpha 1(I) mRNA in hepatocyte cultures treated with either vasopressin or Ca2+ ionophore A23187; hybridizable levels of albumin mRNA also fell approximately 50% following vasopressin treatment. Vasopressin did not affect collagen production in quiescent cultures of mouse Swiss 3T3, human myofibroblast or rat smooth muscle cells; and hepatocyte collagen production was unaffected by treatment with glucagon or dibutyryl cAMP. Thus, accelerated Ca2+ fluxes induced by vasopressin are associated with decreased production of hepatocyte collagen and albumin in primary cultures that simulate quiescent adult rat liver."
