This enlargement is principally due to mitotic proliferation and hypertrophy of the parenchymatous cells."

https://openalex.org/W2057703378,"COENZYME Q (CoQ), which is widely distributed in animal, plant and microbial sources, has been implicated in electron transport1 and generally assumed to be associated with mitochondria. However, it has also been found in non-mitochondrial fractions of green leaves, although it appears to be concentrated in mitochondria2. A similar distribution has now been demonstrated in rat liver cell fractions."

https://openalex.org/W1974344973,"The movements of small burrowing animals submerged in sand are monitored through capacitance changes which detune radio-frequency oscillators. A new dimension of reptilian activity studies is possible by using this technique. Some early observations of several reptile species maintained in darkness in isothermal sand are given. Patterns of behavior during active phases, depth and rate of diving, and duration of quiescent periods are being revealed in detail for the first time."

In mitosis no club-shaped chromosome ends are visible. These results, obtained with a modified fixation procedure, which is described, have been checked by supravital observation."
