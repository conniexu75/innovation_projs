https://openalex.org/W4293792996,"Monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) are a diverse family of complex plant secondary metabolites with many medicinal properties, including the essential anti-cancer therapeutics vinblastine and vincristine1. As MIAs are difficult to chemically synthesize, the world's supply chain for vinblastine relies on low-yielding extraction and purification of the precursors vindoline and catharanthine from the plant Catharanthus roseus, which is then followed by simple in vitro chemical coupling and reduction to form vinblastine at an industrial scale2,3. Here, we demonstrate the de novo microbial biosynthesis of vindoline and catharanthine using a highly engineered yeast, and in vitro chemical coupling to vinblastine. The study showcases a very long biosynthetic pathway refactored into a microbial cell factory, including 30 enzymatic steps beyond the yeast native metabolites geranyl pyrophosphate and tryptophan to catharanthine and vindoline. In total, 56 genetic edits were performed, including expression of 34 heterologous genes from plants, as well as deletions, knock-downs and overexpression of ten yeast genes to improve precursor supplies towards de novo production of catharanthine and vindoline, from which semisynthesis to vinblastine occurs. As the vinblastine pathway is one of the longest MIA biosynthetic pathways, this study positions yeast as a scalable platform to produce more than 3,000 natural MIAs and a virtually infinite number of new-to-nature analogues."
https://openalex.org/W4293792836,"Abstract Recently, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has shown great promise in treating haematological malignancies 1–7 . However, CAR-T cell therapy currently has several limitations 8–12 . Here we successfully developed a two-in-one approach to generate non-viral, gene-specific targeted CAR-T cells through CRISPR–Cas9. Using the optimized protocol, we demonstrated feasibility in a preclinical study by inserting an anti-CD19 CAR cassette into the AAVS1 safe-harbour locus. Furthermore, an innovative type of anti-CD19 CAR-T cell with PD1 integration was developed and showed superior ability to eradicate tumour cells in xenograft models. In adoptive therapy for relapsed/refractory aggressive B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04213469 ), we observed a high rate (87.5%) of complete remission and durable responses without serious adverse events in eight patients. Notably, these enhanced CAR-T cells were effective even at a low infusion dose and with a low percentage of CAR + cells. Single-cell analysis showed that the electroporation method resulted in a high percentage of memory T cells in infusion products, and PD1 interference enhanced anti-tumour immune functions, further validating the advantages of non-viral, PD1 -integrated CAR-T cells. Collectively, our results demonstrate the high safety and efficacy of non-viral, gene-specific integrated CAR-T cells, thus providing an innovative technology for CAR-T cell therapy."

https://openalex.org/W4293793115,"Polymer membranes are widely used in separation processes including desalination1, organic solvent nanofiltration2,3 and crude oil fractionation4,5. Nevertheless, direct evidence of subnanometre pores and a feasible method of manipulating their size is still challenging because of the molecular fluctuations of poorly defined voids in polymers6. Macrocycles with intrinsic cavities could potentially tackle this challenge. However, unfunctionalized macrocycles with indistinguishable reactivities tend towards disordered packing in films hundreds of nanometres thick7-9, hindering cavity interconnection and formation of through-pores. Here, we synthesized selectively functionalized macrocycles with differentiated reactivities that preferentially aligned to create well-defined pores across an ultrathin nanofilm. The ordered structure was enhanced by reducing the nanofilm thickness down to several nanometres. This orientated architecture enabled direct visualization of subnanometre macrocycle pores in the nanofilm surfaces, with the size tailored to ångström precision by varying the macrocycle identity. Aligned macrocycle membranes provided twice the methanol permeance and higher selectivity compared to disordered counterparts. Used in high-value separations, exemplified here by enriching cannabidiol oil, they achieved one order of magnitude faster ethanol transport and threefold higher enrichment than commercial state-of-the-art membranes. This approach offers a feasible strategy for creating subnanometre channels in polymer membranes, and demonstrates their potential for accurate molecular separations."
https://openalex.org/W4293764681,"Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection1 has been associated with highly inflammatory immune activation since the earliest days of the COVID-19 pandemic2-5. More recently, these responses have been associated with the emergence of self-reactive antibodies with pathologic potential6-10, although their origins and resolution have remained unclear11. Previously, we and others have identified extrafollicular B cell activation, a pathway associated with the formation of new autoreactive antibodies in chronic autoimmunity12,13, as a dominant feature of severe and critical COVID-19 (refs. 14-18). Here, using single-cell B cell repertoire analysis of patients with mild and severe disease, we identify the expansion of a naive-derived, low-mutation IgG1 population of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) reflecting features of low selective pressure. These features correlate with progressive, broad, clinically relevant autoreactivity, particularly directed against nuclear antigens and carbamylated proteins, emerging 10-15 days after the onset of symptoms. Detailed analysis of the low-selection compartment shows a high frequency of clonotypes specific for both SARS-CoV-2 and autoantigens, including pathogenic autoantibodies against the glomerular basement membrane. We further identify the contraction of this pathway on recovery, re-establishment of tolerance standards and concomitant loss of acute-derived ASCs irrespective of antigen specificity. However, serological autoreactivity persists in a subset of patients with postacute sequelae, raising important questions as to the contribution of emerging autoreactivity to continuing symptomology on recovery. In summary, this study demonstrates the origins, breadth and resolution of autoreactivity in severe COVID-19, with implications for early intervention and the treatment of patients with post-COVID sequelae."
https://openalex.org/W4293792365,"Phycobilisome (PBS) structures are elaborate antennae in cyanobacteria and red algae1,2. These large protein complexes capture incident sunlight and transfer the energy through a network of embedded pigment molecules called bilins to the photosynthetic reaction centres. However, light harvesting must also be balanced against the risks of photodamage. A known mode of photoprotection is mediated by orange carotenoid protein (OCP), which binds to PBS when light intensities are high to mediate photoprotective, non-photochemical quenching3-6. Here we use cryogenic electron microscopy to solve four structures of the 6.2 MDa PBS, with and without OCP bound, from the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The structures contain a previously undescribed linker protein that binds to the membrane-facing side of PBS. For the unquenched PBS, the structures also reveal three different conformational states of the antenna, two previously unknown. The conformational states result from positional switching of two of the rods and may constitute a new mode of regulation of light harvesting. Only one of the three PBS conformations can bind to OCP, which suggests that not every PBS is equally susceptible to non-photochemical quenching. In the OCP-PBS complex, quenching is achieved through the binding of four 34 kDa OCPs organized as two dimers. The complex reveals the structure of the active form of OCP, in which an approximately 60 Å displacement of its regulatory carboxy terminal domain occurs. Finally, by combining our structure with spectroscopic properties7, we elucidate energy transfer pathways within PBS in both the quenched and light-harvesting states. Collectively, our results provide detailed insights into the biophysical underpinnings of the control of cyanobacterial light harvesting. The data also have implications for bioengineering PBS regulation in natural and artificial light-harvesting systems."

https://openalex.org/W4293792725,"Astrocytic calcium dynamics has been implicated in the encoding of sensory information1–5, and modulation of calcium in astrocytes has been shown to affect behaviour6–10. However, longitudinal investigation of the real-time calcium activity of astrocytes in the hippocampus of awake mice is lacking. Here we used two-photon microscopy to chronically image CA1 astrocytes as mice ran in familiar or new virtual environments to obtain water rewards. We found that astrocytes exhibit persistent ramping activity towards the reward location in a familiar environment, but not in a new one. Shifting the reward location within a familiar environment also resulted in diminished ramping. After additional training, as the mice became familiar with the new context or new reward location, the ramping was re-established. Using linear decoders, we could predict the location of the mouse in a familiar environment from astrocyte activity alone. We could not do the same in a new environment, suggesting that the spatial modulation of astrocytic activity is experience dependent. Our results indicate that astrocytes can encode the expected reward location in spatial contexts, thereby extending their known computational abilities and their role in cognitive functions. Astrocytes can encode an expected reward location in familiar spatial contexts."

https://openalex.org/W4293793095,"Adipose tissues communicate with the central nervous system to maintain whole-body energy homeostasis. The mainstream view is that circulating hormones secreted by the fat convey the metabolic state to the brain, which integrates peripheral information and regulates adipocyte function through noradrenergic sympathetic output1. Moreover, somatosensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia innervate adipose tissue2. However, the lack of genetic tools to selectively target these neurons has limited understanding of their physiological importance. Here we developed viral, genetic and imaging strategies to manipulate sensory nerves in an organ-specific manner in mice. This enabled us to visualize the entire axonal projection of dorsal root ganglia from the soma to subcutaneous adipocytes, establishing the anatomical underpinnings of adipose sensory innervation. Functionally, selective sensory ablation in adipose tissue enhanced the lipogenic and thermogenetic transcriptional programs, resulting in an enlarged fat pad, enrichment of beige adipocytes and elevated body temperature under thermoneutral conditions. The sensory-ablation-induced phenotypes required intact sympathetic function. We postulate that beige-fat-innervating sensory neurons modulate adipocyte function by acting as a brake on the sympathetic system. These results reveal an important role of the innervation by dorsal root ganglia of adipose tissues, and could enable future studies to examine the role of sensory innervation of disparate interoceptive systems."
https://openalex.org/W4293792453,"The nervous system uses various coding strategies to process sensory inputs. For example, the olfactory system uses large receptor repertoires and is wired to recognize diverse odours, whereas the visual system provides high acuity of object position, form and movement1-5. Compared to external sensory systems, principles that underlie sensory processing by the interoceptive nervous system remain poorly defined. Here we developed a two-photon calcium imaging preparation to understand internal organ representations in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), a sensory gateway in the brainstem that receives vagal and other inputs from the body. Focusing on gut and upper airway stimuli, we observed that individual NTS neurons are tuned to detect signals from particular organs and are topographically organized on the basis of body position. Moreover, some mechanosensory and chemosensory inputs from the same organ converge centrally. Sensory inputs engage specific NTS domains with defined locations, each containing heterogeneous cell types. Spatial representations of different organs are further sharpened in the NTS beyond what is achieved by vagal axon sorting alone, as blockade of brainstem inhibition broadens neural tuning and disorganizes visceral representations. These findings reveal basic organizational features used by the brain to process interoceptive inputs."
https://openalex.org/W4293785357,"The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected physical and mental health. Since its commencement in 2020, social distancing has become the “new normal”. Temporary lockdowns and distance learning have disproportionately affected young adults, including university students. To identify effects of the pandemic on university students’ physical and mental health and learning, this empirical study included eight universities in Heidelberg, Mannheim and Ludwigshafen. Data was collected in May and June 2020. The self-administered survey was filled by 1,246 university students. 917 students completed the survey in full. 80.6% were bachelor students (n = 738), the mean semester was 3.8 and mean age was 23.1 years. 51.8% (n = 472) were female students and 47.4% (n = 432) male students. 38.5% (n = 352) stated a deterioration in physical health and 53.1% (n = 485) in mental health. From 0 to 10, students rated mean levels of stress highest due to social distancing (5.6), spending most time at home (5.0) and e-learning (4.5). Compared to male students, female students’ mental health worsened significantly (58.7% vs. 46.8%). A logistic regression analysis identified gender having a significant effect on university students’ stress levels: males seemed to have a lower risk of moderate to high levels of stress compared to females (odds ratio = 0.698; 95% CI = 0.515 to 0.945). Age, city of university and semester did not show a significant effect. The results are important to both regional and international audiences as university students face similar physical and mental health challenges due to the pandemic and its public health measures. Low-threshold initiatives are needed to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. These may include measures to reinforce students’ locus of control, sense of belonging, relaxation and mindfulness as well as (online) counselling services. Gender-specific differences must be taken into account."
https://openalex.org/W4293793012,"Prostate cancer is characterized by considerable geo-ethnic disparity. African ancestry is a significant risk factor, with mortality rates across sub-Saharan Africa of 2.7-fold higher than global averages1. The contributing genetic and non-genetic factors, and associated mutational processes, are unknown2,3. Here, through whole-genome sequencing of treatment-naive prostate cancer samples from 183 ancestrally (African versus European) and globally distinct patients, we generate a large cancer genomics resource for sub-Saharan Africa, identifying around 2 million somatic variants. Significant African-ancestry-specific findings include an elevated tumour mutational burden, increased percentage of genome alteration, a greater number of predicted damaging mutations and a higher total of mutational signatures, and the driver genes NCOA2, STK19, DDX11L1, PCAT1 and SETBP1. Examining all somatic mutational types, we describe a molecular taxonomy for prostate cancer differentiated by ancestry and defined as global mutational subtypes (GMS). By further including Chinese Asian data, we confirm that GMS-B (copy-number gain) and GMS-D (mutationally noisy) are specific to African populations, GMS-A (mutationally quiet) is universal (all ethnicities) and the African-European-restricted subtype GMS-C (copy-number losses) predicts poor clinical outcomes. In addition to the clinical benefit of including individuals of African ancestry, our GMS subtypes reveal different evolutionary trajectories and mutational processes suggesting that both common genetic and environmental factors contribute to the disparity between ethnicities. Analogous to gene-environment interaction-defined here as a different effect of an environmental surrounding in people with different ancestries or vice versa-we anticipate that GMS subtypes act as a proxy for intrinsic and extrinsic mutational processes in cancers, promoting global inclusion in landmark studies."
https://openalex.org/W4293792342,"Central oscillators are primordial neural circuits that generate and control rhythmic movements1,2. Mechanistic understanding of these circuits requires genetic identification of the oscillator neurons and their synaptic connections to enable targeted electrophysiological recording and causal manipulation during behaviours. However, such targeting remains a challenge with mammalian systems. Here we delimit the oscillator circuit that drives rhythmic whisking-a motor action that is central to foraging and active sensing in rodents3,4. We found that the whisking oscillator consists of parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons located in the vibrissa intermediate reticular nucleus (vIRtPV) in the brainstem. vIRtPV neurons receive descending excitatory inputs and form recurrent inhibitory connections among themselves. Silencing vIRtPV neurons eliminated rhythmic whisking and resulted in sustained vibrissae protraction. In vivo recording of opto-tagged vIRtPV neurons in awake mice showed that these cells spike tonically when animals are at rest, and transition to rhythmic bursting at the onset of whisking, suggesting that rhythm generation is probably the result of network dynamics, as opposed to intrinsic cellular properties. Notably, ablating inhibitory synaptic inputs to vIRtPV neurons quenched their rhythmic bursting, impaired the tonic-to-bursting transition and abolished regular whisking. Thus, the whisking oscillator is an all-inhibitory network and recurrent synaptic inhibition has a key role in its rhythmogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4293792656,"Classical mechanisms of volcanic eruptions mostly involve pressure buildup and magma ascent towards the surface1. Such processes produce geophysical and geochemical signals that may be detected and interpreted as eruption precursors1-3. On 22 May 2021, Mount Nyiragongo (Democratic Republic of the Congo), an open-vent volcano with a persistent lava lake perched within its summit crater, shook up this interpretation by producing an approximately six-hour-long flank eruption without apparent precursors, followed-rather than preceded-by lateral magma motion into the crust. Here we show that this reversed sequence was most likely initiated by a rupture of the edifice, producing deadly lava flows and triggering a voluminous 25-km-long dyke intrusion. The dyke propagated southwards at very shallow depth (less than 500 m) underneath the cities of Goma (Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Gisenyi (Rwanda), as well as Lake Kivu. This volcanic crisis raises new questions about the mechanisms controlling such eruptions and the possibility of facing substantially more hazardous events, such as effusions within densely urbanized areas, phreato-magmatism or a limnic eruption from the gas-rich Lake Kivu. It also more generally highlights the challenges faced with open-vent volcanoes for monitoring, early detection and risk management when a significant volume of magma is stored close to the surface."
https://openalex.org/W4293792839,"When protons and neutrons (nucleons) are bound into atomic nuclei, they are close enough together to feel significant attraction, or repulsion, from the strong, short-distance part of the nucleon-nucleon interaction. These strong interactions lead to hard collisions between nucleons, generating pairs of highly-energetic nucleons referred to as short-range correlations (SRCs). SRCs are an important but relatively poorly understood part of nuclear structure and mapping out the strength and isospin structure (neutron-proton vs proton-proton pairs) of these virtual excitations is thus critical input for modeling a range of nuclear, particle, and astrophysics measurements. Hitherto measurements used two-nucleon knockout or ``triple-coincidence'' reactions to measure the relative contribution of np- and pp-SRCs by knocking out a proton from the SRC and detecting its partner nucleon (proton or neutron). These measurementsshow that SRCs are almost exclusively np pairs, but had limited statistics and required large model-dependent final-state interaction (FSI) corrections. We report on the first measurement using inclusive scattering from the mirror nuclei $^3$H and $^3$He to extract the np/pp ratio of SRCs in the A=3 system. We obtain a measure of the np/pp SRC ratio that is an order of magnitude more precise than previous experiments, and find a dramatic deviation from the near-total np dominance observed in heavy nuclei. This result implies an unexpected structure in the high-momentum wavefunction for $^3$He and $^3$H. Understanding these results will improve our understanding of the short-range part of the N-N interaction."
https://openalex.org/W4293783772,"In Australia, telehealth is not new, with several telehealth specialist services being available for those living in rural and remote communities. However, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth was not routinely available for primary care or urban specialist appointments. There has been an increased focus in the use of telehealth within primary care, and particularly general practice, but overall, there has been limited research to date to guide telehealth best-practice based on consumer experiences and preferences within these settings. We aimed to capture the consumer experience of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic, through a novel Kitchen Table Discussion (KTD) method. This increases access to a broader community consumer cohort, with consumer hosts leading discussions in a safe environment. The KTDs were conducted in May 2021, with 10 community members each hosting a group of up to 10 participants. A total of 90 participants took part from across Australia, with the majority living in major cities, although a significant proportion lived in inner and outer regional areas of Australia, or had experience living in rural, regional or remote areas. Seventy percent of participants reported using telehealth in the past. Data were analysed sequentially using thematic analysis and identified key themes: modality, convenience, access, wait time, existing relationship, communication, connectivity, cost, and privacy. Overall, the future of telehealth looks hopeful from the perspective of the consumer, but significant improvements are required to improve consumer engagement and experience. It is evident that 'one size does not fit all', with results suggesting consumers value the availability of telehealth and having choice and flexibility to use telehealth when appropriate, but do not want to see telehealth replacing face-to-face delivery. Participants tended to agree that telehealth was not a preferred method when physical examination was required but would suit certain points of the patient journey."
https://openalex.org/W4294044364,"Delivering patient-centered care is a declared objective of many health delivery systems globally, especially in an era of value-based health care. It entails the active engagement of the patients in healthcare decisions related to their health, also known as shared decision making (SDM). Little is known about the role of gender in shaping the perspective of patients on their opportunity for engaging in SDM in the Arabian Gulf Region. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of gender in shaping patients' perspectives toward their opportunity for SDM in Dubai, UAE.This study utilized a cross-sectional survey consisting of sociodemographic questions and the 9-item Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire (SDM-Q-9). A total of 50 physicians (25 females and 25 males), practicing at a large private healthcare delivery network in Dubai, were recruited using convenience sampling. Ten patients of every recruited physician (5 male and 5 female) were surveyed (i.e., a total of 500 patients). Statistical analysis assessed the differences in patients' perceptions of physician SDM attitude scores by physicians' and patients' gender using independent t-test, ANOVA-test, and Chi-square analyses.A total of 50 physicians and 500 patients (250 male patients and 250 female patients) participated in this study. The odd of patients agreement was significantly lower for male physicians, compared to their female counterparts, on the following elements of SDM: the doctor precisely explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the treatment (OR = 0.55, 95%CI: 0.34-0.88, p = 0.012); the doctor helping them understand the information (OR = 0.47, 95%CI: 0.23-0.97, p = 0.038), the doctor asking about preferred treatment option (OR = 0.52, 95%CI: 0.35-0.77, p = 0.001), and the doctor thoroughly weighting the different treatment options (OR = 0.60, 95%CI: 0.41-0.90, p = 0.013). No significant associations were observed between patients' gender and their perception of their opportunity for SDM. Likewise, no significant associations were observed between the same or different physician-patient gender and patients' perception of physicians' SDM attitudes. Statistically significant associations were observed between physician-patient gender and preferred treatment option for patients (p = 0.012).Study findings suggest that while there were no differences in patients' perspective on SDM by the gender of patients, significant differences were observed by the gender of physicians. Female physicians, compared to their male counterparts, were more engaged in SDM, with both male and female patients. Male physician-female patient dyad received the lowest scores on SDM. This could be explained by the cultural, social, and religious sensitivities that infiltrate the physician-patient relationship in the Arab contexts. Despite the multi-cultural nature of the country, some female patients may still experience some discomfort in opening up and in discussion preferences with male physicians. For physicians, striking the right balance between assertiveness and SDM is necessary within the cultural context, especially among male providers. Offering targeted learning and development programs on the importance and practice of SDM is also necessary to ensure equitable opportunity for engagement in SDM for all patients irrespective of the gender of their provider."
https://openalex.org/W4294125994,"The Hawaiian Archipelago experienced a moderate bleaching event in 2019-the third major bleaching event over a 6-year period to impact the islands. In response, the Hawai'i Coral Bleaching Collaborative (HCBC) conducted 2,177 coral bleaching surveys across the Hawaiian Archipelago. The HCBC was established to coordinate bleaching monitoring efforts across the state between academic institutions, non-governmental organizations, and governmental agencies to facilitate data sharing and provide management recommendations. In 2019, the goals of this unique partnership were to: 1) assess the spatial and temporal patterns of thermal stress; 2) examine taxa-level patterns in bleaching susceptibility; 3) quantify spatial variation in bleaching extent; 4) compare 2019 patterns to those of prior bleaching events; 5) identify predictors of bleaching in 2019; and 6) explore site-specific management strategies to mitigate future bleaching events. Both acute thermal stress and bleaching in 2019 were less severe overall compared to the last major marine heatwave events in 2014 and 2015. Bleaching observed was highly site- and taxon-specific, driven by the susceptibility of remaining coral assemblages whose structure was likely shaped by previous bleaching and subsequent mortality. A suite of environmental and anthropogenic predictors was significantly correlated with observed bleaching in 2019. Acute environmental stressors, such as temperature and surface light, were equally important as previous conditions (e.g. historical thermal stress and historical bleaching) in accounting for variation in bleaching during the 2019 event. We found little evidence for acclimation by reefs to thermal stress in the main Hawaiian Islands. Moreover, our findings illustrate how detrimental effects of local anthropogenic stressors, such as tourism and urban run-off, may be exacerbated under high thermal stress. In light of the forecasted increase in severity and frequency of bleaching events, future mitigation of both local and global stressors is a high priority for the future of corals in Hawai'i."
https://openalex.org/W4294043691,"Introduction The NIH All of Us Research Program will have the scale and scope to enable research for a wide range of diseases, including cancer. The program’s focus on diversity and inclusion promises a better understanding of the unequal burden of cancer. Preliminary cancer ascertainment in the All of Us cohort from two data sources (self-reported versus electronic health records (EHR)) is considered. Materials and methods This work was performed on data collected from the All of Us Research Program’s 315,297 enrolled participants to date using the Researcher Workbench, where approved researchers can access and analyze All of Us data on cancer and other diseases. Cancer case ascertainment was performed using data from EHR and self-reported surveys across key factors. Distribution of cancer types and concordance of data sources by cancer site and demographics is analyzed. Results and discussion Data collected from 315,297 participants resulted in 13,298 cancer cases detected in the survey (in 89,261 participants), 23,520 cancer cases detected in the EHR (in 203,813 participants), and 7,123 cancer cases detected across both sources (in 62,497 participants). Key differences in survey completion by race/ethnicity impacted the makeup of cohorts when compared to cancer in the EHR and national NCI SEER data. Conclusions This study provides key insight into cancer detection in the All of Us Research Program and points to the existing strengths and limitations of All of Us as a platform for cancer research now and in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4294044345,"Drug induced liver injury (DILI) is a rising morbidity amongst patients with COVID-19 clinical syndrome. The updated RUCAM causality assessment scale is validated for use in the general population, but its utility for causality determination in cohorts of patients with COVID-19 and DILI remains uncertain.This retrospective study was comprised of COVID-19 patients presenting with suspected DILI to the emergency department of Weill Cornell medicine-affiliated Hamad General Hospital, Doha, Qatar. All cases that met the inclusion criteria were comparatively adjudicated by two independent rating pairs (2 clinical pharmacist and 2 physicians) utilizing the updated RUCAM scale to assess the likelihood of DILI.A total of 72 patients (mean age 48.96 (SD ± 10.21) years) were examined for the determination of DILI causality. The majority had probability likelihood of ""possible"" or ""probable"" by the updated RUCAM scale. Azithromycin was the most commonly reported drug as a cause of DILI. The median R-ratio was 4.74 which correspond to a mixed liver injury phenotype. The overall Krippendorf's kappa was 0.52; with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.79 (IQR 0.72-0.85). The proportion of exact pairwise agreement and disagreement between the rating pairs were 64.4%, kappa 0.269 (ICC 0.28 [0.18, 0.40]) and kappa 0.45 (ICC 0.43 [0.29-0.57]), respectively.In a cohort of patients with COVID-19 clinical syndrome, we found the updated RUCAM scale to be useful in establishing ""possible"" or ""probable"" DILI likelihood as evident by the respective kappa values; this results if validated by larger sample sized studies will extend the clinical application of this universal tool for adjudication of DILI."
https://openalex.org/W4293793093,"Mesoscale patterns as observed in, for example, ferromagnets, ferroelectrics, superconductors, monomolecular films or block copolymers1,2 reflect spatial variations of a pertinent order parameter at length scales and time scales that may be described classically. This raises the question for the relevance of mesoscale patterns near zero-temperature phase transitions, also known as quantum phase transitions. Here we report the magnetic susceptibility of LiHoF4—a dipolar Ising ferromagnet—near a well-understood transverse-field quantum critical point (TF-QCP)3,4. When tilting the magnetic field away from the hard axis such that the Ising symmetry is always broken, a line of well-defined phase transitions emerges from the TF-QCP, characteristic of further symmetry breaking, in stark contrast to a crossover expected microscopically. We show that the scenario of a continuous suppression of ferromagnetic domains, representing a breaking of translation symmetry on mesoscopic scales in an environment of broken magnetic Ising symmetry on microscopic scales, is in excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement with the field and temperature dependence of the susceptibility and the magnetic phase diagram of LiHoF4 under tilted field. This identifies a new type of phase transition that may be referred to as mesoscale quantum criticality, which emanates from the textbook example of a microscopic ferromagnetic TF-QCP. Our results establish the surroundings of quantum phase transitions as a regime of mesoscale pattern formation, in which non-analytical quantum dynamics and materials properties without classical analogue may be expected. LiHoF4, a dipolar Ising ferromagnet, is investigated near its transverse-field quantum critical point, showing that well-defined mesoscale quantum phase transitions arise when tilting the magnetic field away from the hard axis."

Here we aimed to collect a comprehensive dataset of IgAN patients at our centre over 2 decades to provide real world data, describe outcomes and determine the effects of immunosuppression use.All patients diagnosed with biopsy-proven IgAN at our centre over 2 decades were identified. After exclusions, the total cohort size was 401. Data relating to (i) baseline demographics, (ii) laboratory and urine results, (iii) histological data, and (iv) outcomes of initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) and mortality were collected.The median age was 45.0 years, with 69.6% male and 57.6% hypertensive; 20.4% received immunosuppression, 29.7% progressed to RRT and 19.7% died, over a median follow up period of 51 months. Baseline eGFR was 46.7ml/min/1.73m2 and baseline uPCR was 183mg/mmol. Median rate of eGFR decline was -1.31ml/min/1.73m2/year. Those with a higher MEST-C score had worse outcomes. Immunosuppression use was associated with an increased rate of improvement in proteinuria, but not with a reduction in RRT or mortality. Factors favouring improved outcomes with immunosuppression use included female gender; lower age, blood pressure and T-score; higher eGFR; and ACEi/ARB use.A variety of clinical and histological factors are important in determining risk of progression in IgAN. Therapeutic interventions, particularly use of immunosuppression, should be individualised and guided by these factors."

The overall analysis revealed a total of 30 phyla, 74 classes, 156 orders, 243 families and 408 genera. Firmicutes, Bacteroidota and Proteobacteria were the most abundant phyla overall. A total of 58 genus-level taxa occurred concurrently between the body sites. The important taxa could be categorized into four potentially pathogenic clusters i.e. arthropod-borne; food-borne and zoonotic; mastitogenic; and metritic and abortigenic. A number of taxa were significantly differentially abundant (DA) between sites based on the Wald test implemented in DESeq2 package. Majority of the DA taxa (i.e. Romboutsia, Paeniclostridium, Monoglobus, Akkermansia, Turicibacter, Bacteroides, Candidatus_Saccharimonas, UCG-005 and Prevotellaceae_UCG-004) were significantly enriched in faeces in comparison to milk and blood, except for Anaplasma which was greatly enriched in blood and was in turn the largest microbial genus in the entire analysis. This study provides insights into the microbial community composition of the sampled body sites and its extent of overlapping. It further highlights the potential risk of disease occurrence and transmission between the animals and the community of Waaihoek in KwaZulu-Natal, Republic of South Africa pertaining to their unsanitary practices associated with the use of cattle by-products."
https://openalex.org/W4293788032,"Background The main inhibitor of the fibrinolytic system, Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor -1 (PAI-1), irreversibly binds tissue-type Plasminogen Activator (t-PA) and thereby inhibits the protective action of tPA against thrombus formation. Elevated levels of plasma PAI-1 are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and are observed in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Platelets contain the majority of PAI-1 present in blood and exhibit the ability to synthesis active PAI-1. Diabetic platelets are known to be hyper-reactive and larger in size; however, whether these features affect their contribution to the elevated levels of plasma PAI-1 in T2D is not established. Objectives To characterize the PAI-1 antigen content and the mRNA expression in platelets from T2D subjects compared to obese and lean control subjects, in order to elucidate the role of platelet PAI-1 in T2D. Methods Nine subjects with T2D and obesity were recruited from Primary Care Centers together with 15 healthy control subjects (8 lean subjects and 7 with obesity). PAI-1 antigen levels in plasma, serum and platelets were determined by ELISA, and PAI-1 mRNA expression was analyzed by qPCR. Results There was no significant difference in PAI-1 mRNA expression or PAI-1 antigen in platelets in T2D subject in comparison to obese and lean control subjects. An elevated level of plasma PAI-1 was seen in both T2D and obese subjects. PAI-1 gene expression was significantly higher in both obese groups compared to lean. Conclusion Similar levels of protein and mRNA expression of PAI-1 in platelets from T2D, obese and lean subjects indicate a limited role of platelets for the elevated plasma PAI-1 levels. However, an increased synthesis rate of mRNA transcripts in platelets from T2D and an increased release of PAI-1 could also result in similar mRNA and protein levels. Hence, synthesis and release rates of PAI-1 from platelets in T2D and obesity need to be investigated to further elucidate the role of platelets in obesity and T2D."

Yet, the influences and processes underlying effective teamwork among independent researchers are not well-understood, making it difficult to fully optimize the collaborative process. To address this gap in knowledge, we used the annual NIH mHealth Training Institutes as a testbed to develop stochastic actor-oriented models that explore the communicative interactions and psychological changes of its disciplinarily and geographically diverse participants. The models help investigate social influence and social selection effects to understand whether and how social network interactions influence perceptions of team psychological safety during the institute and how they may sway communications between participants. We found a degree of social selection effects: in particular years, scholars were likely to choose to communicate with those who had more dissimilar levels of psychological safety. We found evidence of social influence, in particular, from scholars with lower psychological safety levels and from scholars with reciprocated communications, although the sizes and directions of the social influences somewhat varied across years. The current study demonstrated the utility of stochastic actor-oriented models in understanding the team science process which can inform team science initiatives. The study results can contribute to theory-building about team science which acknowledges the importance of social influence and selection."
https://openalex.org/W4293784243,"The abnormal posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) is speculated as an important mechanism of the development of the epiretinal membrane (ERM). However, there is only limited information about the molecular mechanism. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a mediator of the mechanosensitive response in several cell types that may have a role in the pathogenesis of ERM during abnormal PVD. Therefore, we evaluated the expression of S1P in the human ERM and the role of S1P in cultured human Muller glial cells. Among 24 ERM specimens, seven specimens (29.2%) exhibited S1P expression. Patients with secondary ERM or ellipsoid zone defects, which suggest abnormal PVD presented a significantly higher S1P+ cell density (secondary ERM: 128.20 ± 135.61 and 9.68 ± 36.01 cells, p = 0.002; EZ defects: 87.56 ± 117.79 vs 2.80 ± 8.85, p = 0.036). The addition of S1P increased the migrative ability and expression of N-cadherin and α-SMA in human Muller glial cells, suggesting S1P is a potential causative molecule for the development of ERM during abnormal PVD."

The transplantation success depends on the functional preservation of organs prior to transplantation. Currently, the University of Wisconsin (UW) and histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) are the most commonly used preservation solutions. Despite intensive efforts, the functional preservation of solid organs prior to transplantation is limited to hours. In this study, we modified the UW solution containing components from both the UW and HTK solutions and analyzed their tissue-protective effect against ischemic injury. The composition of the UW solution was changed by reducing hydroxyethyl starch concentration and adding Histidine/Histidine-HCl which is the main component of HTK solution. Additionally, the preservation solutions were supplemented with melatonin and glucosamine. The protective effects of the preservation solutions were assessed by biochemical and microscopical analysis at 2, 10, 24, and 72 h after preserving the rat kidneys with static cold storage. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in preservation solutions was measured at 2, 10, 24, and 72. It was not detectable at 2 h of preservation in all groups and 10 h of preservation in modified UW+melatonin (mUW-m) and modified UW+glucosamine (mUW-g) groups. At the 72nd hour, the lowest LDH activity (0.91 IU/g (0.63-1.17)) was measured in the mUW-m group. In comparison to the UW group, histopathological damage score was low in modified UW (mUW), mUW-m, and mUW-g groups at 10, 24, and 72 hours. The mUW-m solution at low temperature was an effective and suitable solution to protect renal tissue for up to 72 h."

Given the evident association between arts engagement and wellbeing, this study was designed to compare the predictors and patterns of home-based arts engagement during these lockdowns. Data analysed in this study were from the UK COVID-19 Social Study run by University College London. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify predictors of arts engagement and compare (i) respondents' engagement levels during the first lockdown in April/May 2020 and their levels in pre-pandemic times (N = 23,086), (ii) their engagement levels during the second lockdown in November/December 2020 with their levels during the first lockdown (N = 11,481), and (iii) their engagement levels during the third lockdown in January/February 2021 with their levels during the first lockdown (N = 13,270). During first lockdown, 1 in 4 increased their arts engagement and 1 in 6 decreased it. Of those who increased, 2 in 5 maintained or further increased their engagement in subsequent lockdowns, but just 7% of those who had decreased their engagement increased it. Younger adults (aged 18-29) showed initial increases in first lockdown, whilst people who were not employed and those with a physical health condition showed decreases and people with a mental health condition showed changes during the first lockdown (both increases and decreases). Females and people with higher education showed continuous changes across the three lockdowns, with women being more likely to increase their engagement and those with higher education being less likely to decrease. People of ethnic minorities and those with higher income declined their engagement in the third lockdown. This study provides insight into levels of arts engagement across the three national lockdowns in the UK and suggests that the pandemic may have affected long-term cultural behaviours for some groups."
https://openalex.org/W4293788582,"Among mutations that occur in SARS-CoV-2, efficient identification of mutations advantageous for viral replication and transmission is important to characterize and defeat this rampant virus. Mutations rapidly expanding frequency in a viral population are candidates for advantageous mutations, but neutral mutations hitchhiking with advantageous mutations are also likely to be included. To distinguish these, we focus on mutations that appear to occur independently in different lineages and expand in frequency in a convergent evolutionary manner. Batch-learning SOM (BLSOM) can separate SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences according by lineage from only providing the oligonucleotide composition. Focusing on remarkably expanding 20-mers, each of which is only represented by one copy in the viral genome, allows us to correlate the expanding 20-mers to mutations. Using visualization functions in BLSOM, we can efficiently identify mutations that have expanded remarkably both in the Omicron lineage, which is phylogenetically distinct from other lineages, and in other lineages. Most of these mutations involved changes in amino acids, but there were a few that did not, such as an intergenic mutation."
https://openalex.org/W4293788779,"Many women who engage in sex work in sub-Saharan Africa become pregnant, often unintentionally. There is limited attention paid to the experiences of fathers of children born to women engaged in sex work. We examine the meaning of fatherhood to these men, the significance of children, and how they navigate the economic and cultural challenges of fatherhood in this context. Analysis is based on ethnographic data from 13 men who identified as intimate long-term partners of female sex workers (FSW) in Kampala City, Uganda. Our findings illustrate how men who have children with FSW struggled to model the traditional parameters of fatherhood and masculinity. We found that men who had children with FSW faced hurdles fitting within the social construction of ideal fatherhood. Accepting fatherhood often started with doubts over the pregnancy because of the multiple partnerships of women. Men who only saw themselves as clients struggled to adjust to being fathers because of their perceptions of the social implications of fathering a child with a FSW. Integration of mothers who were also sex workers into the man’s extended family was a challenge because of the fear of negative reactions from family members. However, when men accepted their roles as fathers, they started seeing value in their children. Due to poverty, most of the men fell short of the societal measures of masculinity, but children transformed their social status before their society and family. The provider role often used to define good fathering was a challenge for men. However, the financial support from FSW partners softened the burden and facilitated the creation of a family environment constructed to the perceived standards of the broader society. Our findings provide insights into the state of parenting among FSW and their partners which can guide interventions that are tailored to their unique circumstances."

https://openalex.org/W4294043671,"In cognitive radio sensor networks, single clustering protocol cannot simultaneously satisfy the various requirements of time-triggered and event-driven traffic, as a result, different kinds of clustering protocols are designed to serve them separately. In addition, for event-driven traffic, the long delay incurred by clustering and searching for available routes after events results in poor timeliness of information transmission. In order to solve above problems, a traffic-driven ions motion optimization-based clustering routing protocol (TD-IMOCRP) is proposed in this paper. For the first time, time-triggered and event-driven traffic can be served by a single clustering protocol. To be specific, ions motion optimization algorithm is leveraged to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters and form basic clustering structure. In this case, time-triggered traffic can be periodically served. Priority-based schedule and corresponding frame structure are designed to ensure priority delivery of event-driven information. The clustering architecture built for time-triggered traffic is leveraged, and there is no cluster construction and route selection after emergent events. Only the CRSNs nodes which discover emergent events and corresponding CHs participate in data transmission, which means that TD-IMOCRP covers fewer nodes, especially when the sink is located at the corner. Therefore, it can help reduce node energy consumption and delay. Simulation results demonstrate that compared with representative event-driven clustering protocols, TD-IMOCRP can decrease the average number of covered nodes and the total energy consumption by more than 66.3% and 25%, respectively. In addition, when serving time-triggered traffic, TD-IMOCRP can achieve almost the same performance as its basic version IMOCRP which is better than majority of current time-triggered clustering protocols. In a word, TD-IMOCRP can guarantee in-time delivery of event-driven information while guaranteeing its performance of serving time-triggered traffic."

However, the imposition of emergency restrictions had significant negative impacts on citizens' daily lives. As vaccination progresses, we need to consider more effective measures to control the spread of the infection. The research question of this study is as follows: Does the control of home range correlate with a reduction in the number of infected people during the COVID-19 pandemic? This study aims to clarify the correlation between home range and the number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ibaraki City. Home ranges are analyzed by the Minimum Convex Polygon method using mobile phone GPS location history data. We analyzed the time series cross-correlation between home range lengths and the number of infected people. Results reveal a slight positive correlation between home range and the number of infected people after one week during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding home range length, the cross-correlation coefficient is 0.4030 even at a lag level of six weeks, which has the most significant coefficient. Thus, a decrease in the home range is a weak factor correlated with a reduction in the number of infected people. This study makes a significant contribution to the literature by evaluating key public health challenges from the perspective of controliing the spread of the COVID-19 infectuion. Its findings has implications for policy makers, practitioners, and urban scientists seeking to promote urban sustainability."
https://openalex.org/W4294044396,"Breast cancer remains the most prevalent malignancy in women in many countries around the world, thus calling for better imaging technologies to improve screening and diagnosis. Grating interferometry (GI)-based phase contrast X-ray CT is a promising technique which could make the transition to clinical practice and improve breast cancer diagnosis by combining the high three-dimensional resolution of conventional CT with higher soft-tissue contrast. Unfortunately though, obtaining high-quality images is challenging. Grating fabrication defects and photon starvation lead to high noise amplitudes in the measured data. Moreover, the highly ill-conditioned differential nature of the GI-CT forward operator renders the inversion from corrupted data even more cumbersome. In this paper, we propose a novel regularized iterative reconstruction algorithm with an improved tomographic operator and a powerful data-driven regularizer to tackle this challenging inverse problem. Our algorithm combines the L-BFGS optimization scheme with a data-driven prior parameterized by a deep neural network. Importantly, we propose a novel regularization strategy to ensure that the trained network is non-expansive, which is critical for the convergence and stability analysis we provide. We empirically show that the proposed method achieves high quality images, both on simulated data as well as on real measurements."
https://openalex.org/W4294044404,"Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) have become the cornerstone for the management of malaria in many endemic settings, but their use is constrained for several reasons: (i) persistent malaria antigen (histidine-rich protein 2; HRP2) leading to false positive test results; (ii) hrp2 deletions leading to false negative PfHRP2 results; and (iii) limited sensitivity with a detection threshold of around 100 parasites/μl blood (pLDH- and HRP2-based) leading to false negative tests. Microscopy is still the gold standard for malaria diagnosis, and allows for species determination and quantitation, but requires trained microscopists, maintained microscopes and has detection limit issues. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop and evaluate more sensitive and accurate diagnostic tests. To address this need we have developed a direct on blood mini PCR-NALFIA test that combines the benefits of molecular biology with low infrastructural requirements and extensive training.This is a Phase 3 diagnostic evaluation in 5 African countries. Study sites (Sudan, Ethiopia, Burkina, Kenya and Namibia) were selected to ensure wide geographical coverage of Africa and to address various malaria epidemiological contexts ranging from high transmission to near elimination settings with different clinical scenarios and diagnostic challenges. Study participants will be enrolled at the study health facilities after obtaining written informed consent. Diagnostic accuracy will be assessed following the WHO/TDR guidelines for the evaluation of diagnostics and reported according to STARD principles. Due to the lack of a 100% specific and sensitive standard diagnostic test for malaria, the sensitivity and specificity of the new test will be compared to the available diagnostic practices in place at the selected sites and to quantitative PCR as the reference test.This phase 3 study is designed to validate the clinical performance and feasibility of implementing a new diagnostic tool for the detection of malaria in real clinical settings.

https://openalex.org/W4293784391,"Retention forestry is a common practice for biodiversity conservation in forests managed for wood production. Retention forestry often leaves unharvested patches of trees that vary in size and spatial pattern but experiments evaluating the effects of different retention patch configurations at a constant level of retention are lacking for many regions and taxonomic groups. We implemented an experimental study in clearcut conifer stands with retention across the U.S. Pacific Northwest region. The study consisted of five stand-level (11-55 ha) experimental treatments each replicated 10 times within a randomized complete block design, resulting in 50 treated stands. Retained tree density was comparable across treatments but size, number, and location (upland or riparian) of patches within stands varied among the five treatments. Within experimental treatments, we measured small mammal (<1kg) species and functional trait (i.e., body size, diet, activity stratum) richness in retention patches, surrounding harvested portions of stands, and nearby unharvested stands. We evaluated species and functional trait richness by treatment using generalized linear mixed-effects models and species-specific responses to retention placement using a community occupancy model. We obtained repeat captures of 21 species of small mammals but found limited evidence of a treatment effect on species richness, and no differences in functional trait richness. Species richness was highest where all retained trees were aggregated into one patch placed adjacent to a forested riparian buffer (mean = 6.6 species, 95% CI = 5.7-7.5), and lowest in the treatment containing one retention patch in the upland portion of a harvested stand (mean = 4.7 species, 95% CI = 3.8-5.6). Furthermore, estimates of species richness within retention patches of harvested stands (i.e., not considering species in harvested areas) did not differ among treatments, indicating that the slightly elevated species richness in riparian-associated retention results from 1-2 species in these patches that do not occur in adjacent harvested portions of each treated stand. Patch occupancy of several species was higher in riparian patches than harvested portions of the treated stands, and fewer species had higher occupancy in upland patches compared to harvested portions of treated stands. Our results indicated that at retention densities currently required in Oregon and Washington, the location of retention patches had a small influence on stand-scale measures of small mammal diversity, but local increases in species richness may be obtained by retaining trees adjacent to riparian buffers."
https://openalex.org/W4293785338,"Background Despite high rates of HIV testing and enrolment of HIV-positive pregnant women on antiretroviral therapy in Botswana, coverage for HIV-exposed infant (HEI) testing remains suboptimal. Many factors can contribute to suboptimal HEI testing rates, but they have seldom been thoroughly investigated in Botswana. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the experiences and perspectives of HIV-positive mothers on the barriers and facilitators of HEI testing to inform interventions to promote HEI testing in Botswana. Methods We conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) with HIV-positive mothers who gave birth in 2016 at the three largest public hospitals in Botswana. FGDs were held in Maun, Francistown, and Gaborone from September 2019 to March 2020. The maximum variation sampling method was used to select the participants using information that was abstracted from birth registers and other medical records at the study sites. Mothers were asked to describe their HEI testing experiences, what made it easy or difficult for them to return the HEI for testing, and what needs to be done to improve HEI testing in Botswana. A thematic approach was used to analyse the data. Results Fifteen FGDs with 142 mothers (aged 21–52 years) were held. Participants identified several facilitators to HEI testing, including a mother with adequate knowledge of PMTCT, intensive tracking of HEI by healthcare workers (HCWs), positive attitudes of HCWs toward clients, and social support from significant others. Staff shortages at health care facilities, frequent stock-outs of HIV test kits, fear of stigma, fear of positive test results for the child, and transportation challenges were identified as key barriers to HEI testing. Increasing staffing at healthcare facilities, having adequate supplies of HIV test kits, enhanced HEI tracking, easing access to HEI testing services in rural areas, and providing quality PMTCT education were among the proposed interventions to promote HEI testing. Conclusion Optimizing HEI testing in Botswana will require multi-level interventions at the policy, health system, community, interpersonal, and individual levels."
https://openalex.org/W4293788211,"Objectives Positron emission tomography (PET) is susceptible to patient movement during a scan. Head motion is a continuing problem for brain PET imaging and diagnostic assessments. Physical head restraints and external motion tracking systems are most commonly used to address to this issue. Data-driven methods offer substantial advantages, such as retroactive processing but typically require manual interaction for robustness. In this work, we introduce a time-of-flight (TOF) weighted positron emission particle tracking (PEPT) algorithm that facilitates fully automated, data-driven head motion detection and subsequent automated correction of the raw listmode data. Materials methods We used our previously published TOF-PEPT algorithm Dustin Osborne et al. (2017), Tasmia Rahman Tumpa et al., Tasmia Rahman Tumpa et al. (2021) to automatically identify frames where the patient was near-motionless. The first such static frame was used as a reference to which subsequent static frames were registered. The underlying rigid transformations were estimated using weak radioactive point sources placed on radiolucent glasses worn by the patient. Correction of raw event data were achieved by tracking the point sources in the listmode data which was then repositioned to allow reconstruction of a single image. To create a “gold standard” for comparison purposes, frame-by-frame image registration based correction was implemented. The original listmode data was used to reconstruct an image for each static frame detected by our algorithm and then applying manual landmark registration and external software to merge these into a single image. Results We report on five patient studies. The TOF-PEPT algorithm was configured to detect motion using a 500 ms window. Our event-based correction produced images that were visually free of motion artifacts. Comparison of our algorithm to a frame-based image registration approach produced results that were nearly indistinguishable. Quantitatively, Jaccard similarity indices were found to be in the range of 85-98% for the former and 84-98% for the latter when comparing the static frame images with the reference frame counterparts. Discussion We have presented a fully automated data-driven method for motion detection and correction of raw listmode data. Easy to implement, the approach achieved high temporal resolution and reliable performance for head motion correction. Our methodology provides a mechanism by which patient motion incurred during imaging can be assessed and corrected post hoc."

Over the past decade, marine vessel traffic through the Bering Strait has grown exponentially to take advantage of new ice-free summer shipping routes, increasing the risk of oil spills in these fragile ecosystems. We present a high-resolution coastal vegetation map to serve as a baseline for potential spill response, restoration, and change detection. We segmented 663 km2 of high-resolution multispectral satellite images by the mean-shift method and collected 40 spectral, topographic and spatial variables per segment. The segments were classified using photo-interpreted points as training data, and verified with field based plots. Digitizing points, rather than polygons, and intersecting them with the segmentation allows for rapid collection of training data. We classified the map segments using Random Forest because of its high accuracy, computational speed, and ability to incorporate non-normal, high-dimensional data. We found creating separate classification models by each satellite scene gave highly similar results to models combining the entire study area, and that reducing the number of variables had little impact on accuracy. A unified, study area-wide Random Forest model for both parklands produced the highest accuracy of various models attempted. We mapped 18 distinct classes, with an out-of-bag error of 11.6%, resulting in an improvement to the past per-pixel classification of this coast, and in higher spatial and vegetation classification resolution. The resulting map demonstrates the utility of our point-based method and provides baseline data for incident preparedness and change detection. Elevation is highly correlated with the ordination of the vegetation types, and was the most important variable in all tested classification models. The vegetation classification brings together the largest amount of vegetation data for the Chukchi Sea coast yet documented."
https://openalex.org/W4293788614,"Interoception is the perception of internal bodily signals. It is considered fundamental to developing emotional awareness. For this reason, interoceptive deficits are often associated with alexithymia, a condition characterized by difficulty identifying feelings (DIF), difficulty describing feelings (DDF), and an externally-oriented style of thinking (EOT). Yet, the atypical interoception found in alexithymia might be of a similar type and/or more serious than those found in other partially overlapping constructs that entail emotional difficulties and behavioural patterns associated with specific emotional styles. Our study explores this issue by examining the relationship between the interoceptive deficits associated with alexithymia and the Big Five personality traits. A non-clinical sample (N = 504) completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale, the Big Five Inventory and the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness. Data were analysed using a network analytic approach that conceives psychological traits as networks of interacting symptoms. The estimated network highlighted that EOT is the alexithymia component least associated with interoception and most associated with lower Openness to Experience. Conversely, DIF and Neuroticism are, respectively, the dimensions of alexithymia and the Big Five most highly associated with interoception. We also compared interoceptive abilities in the four groups of participants whose scores were a) high for both alexithymia and neuroticism, b) high only for alexithymia c), high only for neuroticism, and d) low for both. High alexithymia was especially associated with the tendency to ignore sensations of pain or discomfort, while neuroticism was more indicative of the tendency to worry about these sensations. These results suggest that while high alexithymia and neuroticism share some interoceptive deficits, others are unique to alexithymia and contribute to overall lower interoceptive ability in this condition. Our findings suggest that interventions to enhance awareness of bodily sensations can be beneficial especially for profiles who present high neuroticism and alexithymia."

This lockdown drastically disrupted the daily life of autistic individuals’ and that of their families. In the midst of these extraordinary circumstances, we assessed the impact of social restrictions on autistic individuals’ behavior and their parents’ or caregivers’ quality of life; we also sought to identify individual characteristics that may influence such changes. Methods We designed an online survey targeting caregivers living with an autistic child or adult. The questionnaire included 125 five-point Likert questions which targeted changes in families’ quality of life and in autistic individuals’ behavior, as well as factors likely to influence the extent and direction of these changes. Results We collected data from 209 French-speaking Belgian respondents. Respondents reported that the lockdown brought about a higher frequency of nonfunctional socio-communicative behaviors, as well as a decrease in families’ quality of life. Parents who had less access to respite care experienced a steeper decrease in their quality of life. Autistic individuals with comorbidities, and whose parents had less access to respite care and implemented fewer rules at home during lockdown were more likely to display nonfunctional socio-communicative behaviors.

This study examined stroke inpatient rehabilitation referral acceptance rates for persons with CI before and after the implementation of a multi-faceted integrated knowledge translation (KT) intervention aimed at improving clinicians' skills in a cognitive-strategy based approach, Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP), CO-OP KT.CO-OP KT was implemented at five inpatient rehabilitation centres, using an interrupted time series design and data from an electronic referral and database system called E-Stroke. CO-OP KT included a 2-day workshop, 4 months of implementation support, health system support, and a sustainability plan. A mixed effects model was used to model monthly acceptance rates for 12 months prior to the intervention and 6 months post.The dataset was comprised of 2604 pre-intervention referrals and 1354 post. In the mixed effects model, those with CI had a lower pre-intervention acceptance rate than those without. Post-intervention the model showed the acceptance rate for those with CI increased by 8.6% (p = 0.02), whereas those with no CI showed a non-significant increase of less than 1%.Proportionally more persons with CI gained access to inpatient stroke rehabilitation following an integrated KT intervention."
https://openalex.org/W4294044321,"The Audio Processor Satisfaction Questionnaire (APSQ) is a standardized tool to measure a user's satisfaction with their audio processor(s). It was first developed and validated in the German language. The purpose of the current study was to validate the English version of the APSQ.The 15 items of the APSQ were translated into English. Item and scale analyses assessed the quality of individual items and of the questionnaire in its entirety.Sixty-seven adults with hearing implants participated. Forty-six of them completed the questionnaire twice within 2-4 weeks.High mean values were obtained with total scores and with scores of the comfort, social life, and usability domains, indicating that users are generally satisfied with their audio processors. The questionnaire achieved good test-retest reliability with high internal consistency. A significant positive correlation between time since implantation and user satisfaction was found.Results of the item and reliability analyses suggest that the English version of the APSQ is a valid and reliable tool to assess user satisfaction with their audio processor(s)."
https://openalex.org/W4294044351,"Background We investigated differences in risk of stroke, with all-cause mortality as a competing risk, in people newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF) who were commenced on either direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or warfarin treatment. Methods and results We conducted a retrospective cohort study of the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) database (a network of 500 English general practices). We compared long term exposure to DOAC (n = 5,168) and warfarin (n = 7,451) in new cases of AF not previously treated with oral anticoagulants. Analyses included: survival analysis, estimating cause specific hazard ratios (CSHR), Fine-Gray analysis for factors affecting cumulative incidence of events occurring over time and a cumulative risk regression with time varying effects.We found no difference in CSHR between stroke 1.08 (0.72–1.63, p = 0.69) and all-cause mortality 0.93 (0.81–1.08, p = 0.37), or between the anticoagulant groups. Fine-Gray analysis produced similar results 1.07 (0.71–1.6 p = 0.75) for stroke and 0.93 (0.8–1.07, p = 0.3) mortality. The cumulative risk of mortality with DOAC was significantly elevated in early follow-up (67 days), with cumulative risk decreasing until 1,537 days and all-cause mortality risk significantly decreased coefficient estimate:: -0.23 (-0.38–0.01, p = 0.001); which persisted over seven years of follow-up. Conclusions In this large, contemporary, real world primary care study with longer follow-up, we found no overall difference in the hazard of stroke between warfarin and DOAC treatment for AF. However, there was a significant time-varying effect between anti-coagulant regimen on all-cause mortality, with DOACs showing better survival. This is a key methodological observation for future follow-up studies, and reassuring for patients and health care professionals for longer duration of therapy"
https://openalex.org/W4294044406,"HIV acquisition among pregnant and breastfeeding women in sub-Saharan Africa and vertical transmission rates remain high despite established strategies for HIV prevention. During the MTN-041/MAMMA study, we explored the influence of grandmothers (mothers and mothers-in-law of pregnant and breastfeeding women) in eastern and southern Africa on the health-related decisions of pregnant and breastfeeding women and their potential to support use of HIV prevention products. To do this we used structured questionnaires and focus group discussions with three stakeholder groups: 1) grandmothers, 2) HIV-uninfected currently or recently pregnant or breastfeeding women and 3) male partners of currently or recently pregnant or breastfeeding women. A total of 23 focus group discussions comprising 68 grandmothers, 65 pregnant or breastfeeding women and 63 male partners were completed across four study sites. Grandmothers were described as important sources of information during pregnancy and breastfeeding playing both supportive and influencer roles due to personal maternal experience and generational knowledge. While pregnant and breastfeeding women were not keen to involve grandmothers in HIV prevention decision making, they were accepting of grandmothers’ involvement in a supportive role. Grandmothers expressed willingness to support pre-exposure prophylaxis use and agreed with the other two stakeholder groups that this decision should be made by women themselves or together with partners. These novel data indicate potential for grandmothers’ health related supportive roles to be extended to support decision-making and adherence to biomedical HIV prevention options, and possibly contribute to the decline in HIV acquisition among pregnant and breastfeeding women in these communities."
