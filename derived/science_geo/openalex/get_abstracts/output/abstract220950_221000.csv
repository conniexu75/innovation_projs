Within affected cells, ubiquitinated and hyperphosphorylated tau assembles into massive filamentous polymers. Eventually these tangle-bearing neurons die. The formation of neurofibrillary tangles closely parallels the progression and anatomic distribution of neuronal loss in Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that these lesions play a role in the disease pathogenesis. Mutations in the human tau gene cause autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorders. These and other neurodegenerative conditions are also characterized by extensive neurofibrillary pathology. The mechanisms underlying tau-mediated neurotoxicity remain unclear; however, phosphorylated tau is a strong candidate for a toxic molecule, particularly those isoforms phosphorylated by the kinases glycogen synthase kinase 3β and Cdk5. Here we show that Alzheimer tau binds to Hsc70, and its phosphorylation is a recognition requirement for the addition of ubiquitin (Ub) by the E3 Ub ligase CHIP (carboxyl terminus of the Hsc70-interacting protein) and the E2 conjugating enzyme UbcH5B. Other E3 Ub ligases including parkin and Cbl failed to ubiquitinate phosphorylated tau. CHIP could rescue phosphorylated tau-induced cell death, and therefore the CHIP-Hsc70 complex may provide a new therapeutic target for the tauopathies.

Tau inclusions are a major feature of several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (1Jellinger K.A. J. Neural Transm.

Normally, tau functions as a neuronal microtubule-binding protein, and its binding to microtubules is regulated both by alternative splicing within the binding region and by phosphorylation in and around the binding region (3Kosik K.S. Brain Microtubule-associated Proteins. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1997: 43-52Google Scholar). The flanking region around the microtubule-binding repeats is phosphorylated by multiple different kinases. Up to 19 different sites can be phosphorylated on tau (4Johnson G.V. Jenkins S.M. J. Alzheimers Dis. 1999; 1: 307-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 5Buee L. Bussiere T. Buee-Scherrer V. Delacourte A. Hof P.R. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 33: 95-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar), thus creating a staggeringly high number of possible tau phosphoisoforms. Little is known about the function of these different phosphorylation states other than that they alter the binding kinetics of tau to microtubules. Not only are many different sites phosphorylated on tau, allowing for quite subtle regulation of microtubule binding, but the controls over the sites can be regulated through different signaling pathways as indicated by the many different kinases capable of phosphorylating tau. Among the kinases capable of phosphorylating tau in vitro are both proline-directed kinases and non-proline-directed kinases. They include glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), 1The abbreviations used are: GSKglycogen synthase kinasePHFpaired helical filamentE1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin carrier proteinE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligaseMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidGSTglutathione S-transferasePP2Aprotein phosphatase 2AEGFPenhanced green fluorescence proteinADAlzheimer's disease.1The abbreviations used are: GSKglycogen synthase kinasePHFpaired helical filamentE1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin carrier proteinE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligaseMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidGSTglutathione S-transferasePP2Aprotein phosphatase 2AEGFPenhanced green fluorescence proteinADAlzheimer's disease. extracellular signal regulated kinase, stress-activated protein kinase, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), CDC2-cyclin A kinase, MARK kinase, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, casein kinase I and II, double-stranded DNA-dependent protein kinase, microtubule-associated protein/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase, and tau-tubulin kinase (4Johnson G.V.

Rev. 2000; 33: 95-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar).Because phosphorylation releases tau from microtubules and because tau in the paired helical filament (PHF) is highly phosphorylated, kinases have been viewed with interest for a possible role in pathogenesis. Fath et al. (6Fath T. Eidenmuller J. Brandt R. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9733-9741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that replacement of certain amino acids at known sites of phosphorylation with a charged amino acid to create “pseudohyperphosphorylated” tau can mimic structural and functional aspects of hyperphosphorylated tau; in differentiated PC12 cells, PHF-tau exhibited reduced microtubule interaction and caused apoptotic cell death. In vivo evidence for an interaction with tau exists for Cdk-5 and GSK-3β. Overexpression of human p25 (an activator of Cdk5) in mice induced tau hyperphosphorylation and cytoskeletal disruptions reminiscent of AD, but no filamentous deposits (7Ahlijanian M.K.

Tau was hyperphosphorylated at several sites in the double transgenics, and a highly significant accumulation of aggregated tau occurred in the brainstem and cortex. Increased numbers of silver-stained neurofibrillary tangles accompanied these changes as well as an association of active GSK with insoluble tau (8Noble W. Olm V. Takata K. Casey E. Mary O. Meyerson J. Gaynor K. LaFrancois J. Wang L. Kondo T. Davies P. Burns M. Nixon Veeranna R. Dickson D. Matsuoka Y. Ahlijanian M. Lau L.F. Duff K.

Overexpression of GSK-3β under the control of a tetracycline-sensitive transactivator also induced tau hyperphosphorylation, somatodendritic mislocalization of tau, and neuronal apoptosis (9Lucas J.J. Hernandez F. Gomez-Ramos P. Moran M.A. Hen R. Avila J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). However, the complexity of the role of GSK-3β was underscored in transgenic mice that expressed a constitutively active mutant form of human GSK-3β and surprisingly did not show neurofibrillary pathology. In fact, when crossed with the htau40 transgenic mouse, they improved the axonal dilations and motoric problems observed in htau40 mice (10Spittaels K. Van den Haute C. Van Dorpe J. Geerts H.

Nevertheless, overall these studies implicate tau hyperphosphorylation in tau-related neurodegeneration.Ubiquitination is a cellular process by which short lived or damaged proteins are conjugated with multimers of Ub, marking them for degradation in the proteasome. Conjugation requires an enzymatic cascade system that includes E1 Ub-activating enzyme, E2 Ub-conjugating enzyme (Ubc), and E3 Ub ligase enzyme. Evidence in favor of the Ub-proteasome system involvement in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration includes the following: 1) inclusion bodies found in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders contain Ub and ubiquitinated proteins; 2) mutations in two Ub pathway enzymes, parkin (11Kitada T.

Belizaire R. Isacson O. Jenner P. Olanow C.W. Exp. Neurol. 2003; 179: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar); 4) a mutation in a multi-Ub gene is associated with AD (18De Vrij F.M. Sluijs J.A. Gregori L. Fischer D.F. Hermens W.T. Goldgaber D. Verhaagen J. Van Leeuwen F.W. Hol E.M.

Dodge I. Band H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 753-763PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that hyperphosphorylated tau could be ubiquitinated by an unknown E3 Ub ligase(s) for proteasomal delivery and degradation. Here we show that a CHIP (carboxyl terminus of the Hsc70-interacting protein)-Hsc70 complex selectively ubiquitinates phosphorylated tau in collaboration with UbcH5B. Furthermore, CHIP attenuates phosphorylated tau-induced cell death.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells and Transfection—COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 environment. Cells were transfected with various expression vectors using the LipofectAMINE 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Immunopurification, Immunoblotting, and Immunocytochemistry—Temporal cortex specimens (2 g) from human brain were homogenized using the lysis buffer and sedimented at 20,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were incubated with protein A and protein G-Sepharose (Pierce) cross-linked to tau antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. For immunoblotting, transfected cells were lysed in the lysis buffer, and the extracts were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatants were referred to as the 1% Triton X-100-soluble fraction. The pellets were further resolved in lysis buffer containing 4% SDS and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h at 22 °C. The supernatants were referred to as the 1% Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. 4× SDS in sample buffer was added to the lysates, and immunoprecipitation, PAGE, and immunoblots were performed as described (21Shimura H. Schlossmacher M.G. Hattori N. Frosch M.P. Trockenbacher A. Schneider R. Mizuno Y. Kosik K.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2001; 293: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). We washed immunoprecipitated beads by 1 m NaCl, and the fraction that was released from beads was named as the co-factor fraction. For immunocytochemistry, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% formaldehyde, and then stained with anti-FLAG (Sigma) antibody or AT8 (Pierce). Primary antibody was localized by secondary antibody conjugated to Texas Red (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, West Grove, PA) at room temperature for 1 h. Live and dead cells were distinguished with the LIVE/DEAD viability/cytotoxicity kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stained cells were analyzed with a laser-scanning confocal microscope system (Zeiss, Heidelberg, Germany).In Vitro Tau Phosphorylation, Dephosphorylation, and Deglycosylation Assay—Active recombinant GSK-3β was incubated in 30 μl of reaction mixture containing 10 μm ATP, recombinant His-tau, and kinase buffer. Immunoprecipitated tau was incubated with N-glycosidase or O-glycosidase as per the manufacturer's protocol (Pro Zyme, San Leandro, CA). Immunoprecipitated tau was incubated with protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B or protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) for 6 h at 37 °C.In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay of Immunoprecipitated Tau—We eluted immunoprecipitated tau from antibodies that were chemically conjugated to protein A- and G-Sepharose beads, and proteins were eluted from the beads with 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.8, and the beads were removed. Then pH (acidic to neutral) was collected by 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Immunoprecipitated tau was incubated in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 200 ng of Ub-activating enzyme (E1), a Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2) fraction, or 4 μg of each E2, 2 μg of FLAG-Ub, and reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm ATP, and 2 mm MgCl2) for 30 min at 37 °C. To release the co-factor fraction from immunoprecipitated tau, we washed the beads with 1 m NaCl before performing the in vitro ubiquitination assay. After the in vitro ubiquitination assay, FLAG-ubiquitinated proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. The precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with various antibodies.In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay of Recombinant His-Tau—His-tau and phosphorylated His-tau by GSK-3β was incubated in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 200 ng of E1, 4 μg of UbcH5B, 2 μg of FLAG-Ub, co-factor fraction or 2 μg of GST-CHIP and 1 μg of Hsc70, and reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm ATP, and 2 mm MgCl2) for 30 min at 37 °C.Purification of Ub Ligase for Phosphorylated Tau—Temporal cortex specimens (100 g) from normal human brain were homogenized using lysis buffer (50 mm MES, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm EGTA, pH 6.5, containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 20 mm NaF) in the presence of EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and sedimented at 20,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatants were passed over a phosphorylated His-tau (200-μg) column first, and then a GST-UbcH5B (100-μg) column followed by a wash in PBS and then fractionated and eluted with 1 m NaCl. Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gels were sliced and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Ubiquitin ligase activity of the elutions was analyzed by an in vitro phosphorylated tau ubiquitination assay.His-Tau Pull-down Assay—His-tau or phosphorylated His-tau (2 μg) coupled to nickel beads was added to normal human brain homogenates and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with shaking. The proteins were eluted from the beads by adding 40 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer.Antibodies—The antibodies used were 5E2 (22Joachim C.L. Morris J.H. Selkoe D.J. Kosik K.S. J. Neuropathol. Exp.

Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Iwai K. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). EGFP-tau was generated as described previously (27Lu M. Kosik K.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 171-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). HA-Cbl, Myc-CHIP, mutant Myc-CHIP, and recombinant GST-CHIP were generous gifts from Dr. Band. HA-GSK3β was a gift from Dr. Woodgett. GSK-3β was cloned into pcDNA 3.1(+) Vector. Mutant GSK-3β K85R was cloned into pAdTrack vector using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Recombinant His-tau, FLAG-Ub, E1, E2s, GSK-3β, Hsc70, PP2A, and protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B were purchased from Sigma.RESULTSAD Brain Tau Is Polyubiquitinylated in Collaboration with UbcH5B—To determine whether tau from human brain is ubiquitinated in vitro, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments on homogenates of frozen frontal cortex from two normal brains and three AD brains. We used a tau antibody mixture that included 5E2 (22Joachim C.L. Morris J.H. Selkoe D.J. Kosik K.S. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1987; 46: 611-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 23Kosik K.S. Orecchio L.D. Binder L. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Lee G. Neuron. 1988; 1: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) and affinity-purified polyclonal tau antibodies. Tau was extracted using 1% Triton X-100, and therefore the more insoluble forms of tau-associated PHFs would not be solubilized. As observed by others, both three- and four-repeat tau proteins were immunoprecipitated; however, proportionally considerably more four-repeat tau was present. We eluted tau from the tau antibodies and carried out an in vitro ubiquitination reaction, which utilized commercially available mammalian E1, E2 fractions, and FLAG-Ub. We immunoprecipitated FLAG-Ub-conjugated molecules with anti-FLAG antibody beads and probed with the polyclonal tau antibody. Interestingly, in an in vitro ubiquitination reaction, AD tau was ubiquitinated, and control tau was not (Fig. 1a).This procedure utilized a co-factor fraction obtained by washing the immunoprecipitated tau in 1 m NaCl. A fraction obtained by washing the immunoprecipitated beads in 1 m NaCl before tau was eluted did not ubiquitinate tau in vitro (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, immunoprecipitated tau before undergoing in vitro ubiquitination, was not ubiquitinated. This experiment indicated that the co-factor fraction contained an E3 Ub ligase for tau. The high molecular weight band in these experiments was ubiquitinated tau, and not aggregated tau, because the experiment, when done without FLAG-Ub, did not reveal a high molecular weight band with the polyclonal tau antibody.The in vitro ubiquitination of AD tau, but not control tau, was based on reactions that utilized commercially available E1 and E2 fractions. We substituted single specific E2s in the in vitro ubiquitination reaction and found that AD tau was intensely and consistently ubiquitinated with UbcH5B (Fig. 1b). The other E2s tried in the reaction mixture did not ubiquitinate AD tau. This result strongly suggested that the E2 conjugating enzyme for tau ubiquitination is UbcH5B. High molecular weight tau polyubiquitination products obtained by using UbcH5B in the in vitro ubiquitination reactions were observed only with tau that was immunoprecipitated from AD and not from normal control brain, as expected (data not shown).Phosphorylation of Tau Is the Signal for Tau Ubiquitination—The observations above led to the question of what modifications of tau are recognized by the E3 Ub ligase. The most likely modifications are phosphorylation and/or glycosylation (4Johnson G.V. Jenkins S.M. J. Alzheimers Dis. 1999; 1: 307-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 5Buee L. Bussiere T. Buee-Scherrer V. Delacourte A. Hof P.R. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 33: 95-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). Our experiments showed that AD type phosphorylation of tau is the signal for tau ubiquitination. AD tau was immunoprecipitated from brain and treated with PP2A, protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B, N-glycosidase, sialidase, or O-glycosidase and then in vitro ubiquitinated, immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies, and finally incubated with the polyclonal tau antibody. High molecular weight polyubiquitinated tau can be seen in all lanes except in the control (no incubation) and in the PP2A-treated lane (Fig. 1c). These data indicated that phosphorylation of PP2A dephosphorylation sites is an important recognition signal for ubiquitination. This finding lends further support to the importance of tau phosphorylation in tangle formation whether in AD or in the tauopathies.Alzheimer Tau Is Bound to Hsc-70—We first focused on the co-factor fraction to identify the tau E3 Ub ligase. Initially, proteins in the co-factor fraction were visualized by gel electrophoresis, and those bands, which were uniquely observed in the AD tau immunoprecipitation, were analyzed by mass spectrometry. However, we could not identify the E3 Ub ligase in this experiment (data not shown). We then refined the strategy based on the finding that PP2A can eliminate recognition by the E3 Ub ligase and prevent in vitro ubiquitination. PP2A is very abundant in brain and is associated with microtubules (28Gong C.X. Wegiel J. Lidsky T. Zuck L. Avila J. Wisniewski H.M. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Brain Res. 2000; 853: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). By using metabolically competent rat brain slices as a model, selective inhibition of PP2A by okadaic acid induced an AD-like hyperphosphorylation and accumulation of tau (29Sontag E.

These include sites Ser199, Ser202, Thr205, Ser396, and Ser404 (30Papasozomenos S.C. Su Y. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 396-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 31Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V.

We used 200 μg of amino-terminal His-tagged full-length recombinant human tau in an in vitro phosphorylation reaction with GSK-3β. When phosphorylated, the tau protein reacted on immunoblots with PHF1 (25Greenberg S.G. Davies P. Schein J.D. Binder L.I. J. Biol.

Following GSK-3β incubation, this tau served as an excellent substrate for in vitro ubiquitination using UbcH5B and the co-factor fraction from AD tau immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2a). This finding suggested that GSK-3β can place phosphates on tau that create recognition sites for an E3 Ub ligase. The finding does not imply that GSK-3β has this property exclusively; in fact, Cdk5 can also place phosphates on tau that serve as an E3 Ub ligase recognition signal, because tau phosphorylated by Cdk5 was also ubiquitinated in vitro (data not shown).Fig. 2CHIP serves as a ubiquitin ligase for phosphorylated tau in vitro.a, recombinant His-tau was phosphorylated by GSK-3β, and in vitro ubiquitination was performed using FLAG-Ub, E1, UbcH5B, and the co-factor fraction from AD tau immunoprecipitates. b, normal brain homogenate was passed through the two affinity columns: a phosphorylated His-tau column and GST-UbcH5B column. The eluate was separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. In vitro phosphorylated tau is ubiquitinated by the eluate. Phosphorylated tau was incubated with FLAG-Ub, E1, and UbcH5B and then immunoprecipitated with a FLAG antibody. High Mr tau immunoreactivity was detected by the polyclonal tau antibody. c, His-tau or His-phosphorylated tau was incubated with human brain homogenates and washed.

Normal human brain extract was passed over the column. The bound fraction was eluted and passed over a column bound to amino-terminal GST-UbcH5B. When the fraction bound to this column was eluted, it retained E3 Ub ligase activity for the recombinant phosphorylated tau substrate (Fig. 2b). The sample contained five bands by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (from 27 to 70 kDa) (Fig. 2b), and each of these bands was analyzed by mass spectroscopy. The analysis revealed that the 70-kDa band was the heat shock cognate 70-kDa protein (Hsc70).Furthermore, we examined the specificity of the interaction between phosphorylated tau and Hsc70. We conjugated phosphorylated His-tau and nonphosphorylated His-tau to nickel beads and added homogenates of temporal cortex from normal human brain. We found a large amount of Hsc70 in the pull-down with phosphorylated His-tau conjugated to the nickel beads, and considerably more Hsc70 compared with the nonphosphorylated His-tau, suggesting that Hsc70 predominantly binds phosphorylated tau (Fig. 2c).In Vitro Ubiquitination of the CHIP-Hsc70-phosphorylated Tau Complexes—The presence of"

A-to-I RNA editing of the coding sequence could result in synthesis of proteins not directly encoded in the genome. ADAR edits also non-coding sequences of target RNAs, such as introns and 3′-untranslated regions, which may affect splicing, translation, and mRNA stability. Three mammalian ADAR gene family members (ADAR1-3) have been identified. Here we investigated phenotypes of mice homozygous for ADAR1 null mutation. Although live ADAR1-/- embryos with normal gross appearance could be recovered up to E11.5, widespread apoptosis was detected in many tissues. Fibroblasts derived from ADAR1-/- embryos were also prone to apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. Our results demonstrate an essential requirement for ADAR1 in embryogenesis and suggest that it functions to promote survival of numerous tissues by editing one or more double-stranded RNAs required for protection against stress-induced apoptosis.

The inosine residue converted from adenosine in RNA is detected as an A-to-G change of the cDNA sequence, and the translation machinery reads inosine as guanosine. Thus, A-to-I RNA editing could lead to alteration of codons and functions of the affected genes when it occurs within the coding sequences (1Bass B.L. Annu. Rev.

For instance, RNA editing results in dramatic changes of glutamate receptor (GluR) ion channel properties such as Ca2+ permeability and kinetics of channel gating (4Higuchi M. Single F.N. Köhler M.

However, dsRNAs formed by inverted repeats of non-coding sequences such as introns and 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) may be the most common substrates of this type of RNA editing (11Morse D.P. Aruscavage P.J. Bass B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7906-7911Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Here activation of the alternative splicing pathway or changes in splicing rate, translation efficiency, or mRNA stability may result from editing (11Morse D.P. Aruscavage P.J. Bass B.L. Proc. Natl.

Curiously, repetitive elements such as Alu and LINE1 are commonly present in these intronic and UTR sequences subjected to A-to-I RNA, raising the possibility that A-to-I RNA editing may be involved in a mechanism regulating the repetitive sequences and transposons in mammalian genomes (11Morse D.P. Aruscavage P.J. Bass B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7906-7911Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dsRNA formed between sense mRNA and antisense transcripts (more frequently transcribed than previously thought), may be subjected to A-to-I RNA editing (13Carmichael G.G. Nat.

Finally, ADAR appears to prevent silencing of transgenes in Caenorhabditis elegans regulated through their dsRNA transcripts and the RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism (15Knight S.W. Bass B.L. Mol.

Studies of in vitro RNA editing using purified recombinant ADAR proteins indicate that there are significant site-selectivity differences displayed by different ADAR gene family members (6Burns C.M.

For instance, ADAR2 edits almost exclusively the D site of 5-HT2CR and the Q/R site of GluR-B RNA, whereas ADAR1 selectively edits the A and B sites of 5-HT2CR RNA and the intronic hot spot (+60 site) of GluR-B RNA. No in vitro RNA editing activity of ADAR3 has been demonstrated yet (21Chen C.-X. Cho D.-S.C. Wang Q. Lai F. Carter K.C. Nishikura K. RNA (New York). 2000; 6: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 22Melcher T. Maas S. Herb A. Sprengel R. Higuchi M. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31795-31798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The editing site-selectivity of different ADARs, which is highly discriminating, indicates a significant difference in their interactions with substrate RNAs through their unique structural features such as N termini and numbers and sequences of dsRNA binding domains. In addition, both ADAR1 and ADAR2 form a homodimer complex, and functional interactions between the two monomer subunits appear to be essential for the site-selective editing mechanism (28Cho D.-S. Yang W. Lee J.T. Shiekhattar R. Murray J.M. Nishikura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17093-17102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). A wide range of phenotypic alterations following inactivation of ADAR gene family members has been reported. Lack of coordinated locomotion and behavior changes are found with flies homozygous for a null mutation of dADAR (29Palladino M.J. Keegan L.P. O'Connell M.A. Reenan R.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 437-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Defective chemotaxis is detected with C. elegans strains containing homozygous deletions of both c.e.ADAR1 and c.e.ADAR2 genes, whereas aberrant development of the vulva is noted in a fraction of c.e.ADAR1 null worms (30Tonkin L.A. Saccomanno L. Morse D.P. Brodigan T. Krause M. Bass B.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6025-6035Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Mice with a homozygous ADAR2 null mutation die several weeks after birth with repeated episodes of epileptic seizures because of underediting of GluR-B RNA at the Q/R site and consequent excessive Ca2+ influx into neurons (31Higuchi M. Maas S. Single F.N. Hartner J. Rozov A. Burnashev N. Feldmeyer D. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 2000; 406: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Exact cause-effect relationship of a specific phenotype and the inactivated ADAR gene has not been demonstrated except for the mammalian ADAR2 gene targeting (31Higuchi M. Maas S. Single F.N. Hartner J. Rozov A. Burnashev N. Feldmeyer D. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 2000; 406: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism and the affected RNA targets underlying most ADAR mutant phenotypes are largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the role played by ADAR1 during development by using a mouse line harboring a new ADAR1 null mutation allele established via the Cre-LoxP system. Analysis of staged embryos revealed that ADAR1-/- homozygous embryos die at E11.0 to E12.5. Most significantly, widespread apoptosis was detected in many tissues of ADAR1-/- embryos collected live at E10.5 to E11.5, despite their normal gross appearance. Elevated apoptosis was detected also in ADAR1-/- primary embryonic fibroblasts subjected to serum deprivation. Our results suggest that A-to-I editing of a currently unknown dsRNA(s) by ADAR1 is required for cell survival and embryo development by protecting against stress-induced apoptosis. Mice—FVB/N mice were purchased from Taconic Farms, and Ella-Cre and Alb-Cre mice were from The Jackson Laboratory. BALB/c SCID mice were obtained from the Wistar Animal Facility. Oligonucleotides—The following oligonucleotides used for PCR genotyping analysis and dideoxy oligonucleotide primer extension analysis were synthesized at the University of Pennsylvania, Cancer Center Nucleic Acid Facility: PR-1, 5′-CGGGATCCCCAAGGTGGAGAATGGTGAGTGGTA-3′; PR-2, 5′-GCTCTAGAAGAGGGCACAGCCACAGCAGGAC-3′; PR-3, 5′-CGGGATCCTTAATGGTAGAACATAATAGATGGTACCA-3′; PR-4, 5′-GCTCTAGAGAATCAAACCCACAAGAGGCCAGTG-3′; PRCre-1, 5′-GGCCAGCTAAACATGCTTCATCGTC-3′; PRCre-2, 5′-ACGTAACAGGGTGTTATAAGCAATCCC-3′; PKRE2S, 5′-CTTTGCAGGCCACTGGGAGGAAAAATG-3′; PKRE2A, 5′-TGGCAGCCTACCTTCTGTCATGTGGAG-3′; Neo3′S, 5′-GTTGCCAGCCATCTGTTGTTTGCCC-3′; EXMRG, 5′GCATCGCCACACCTAAAGGATCCTCA-3′; EXMQR5, 5′-TTGGGCATCAGCTCCGATCCTT-3′; and EXMQR6, 5′-TTGGGCATGAGCTCAGAACCTT-3′. Targeting Vector—The targeting vector, pADAR1-3LoxP-Neo-2TK, was constructed to generate the floxed ADAR1 (ADAR1-3LoxP) allele. The vector contained a 12-kb fragment of mouse 129/SV genomic ADAR1 DNA. A positive selectable genetic marker, pPGKneobpA (32Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar) going in the sense direction, and two LoxP cassettes were inserted at the StuI site located within the intron 11. The third LoxP cassette was constructed by PCR and inserted at the NdeI site located within the 3′-UTR region. The vector also contained two copies of the MC1TKpA cassette (32Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar) for negative selection, inserted one upstream and the other downstream of the homologous sequences in the sense orientation. Plasmid DNA was linearized with NotI and used for electroporation. ES Cell Targeting and Generation of ADAR1flox/flox, ADAR1+/-, and ADAR1flox/flox/Alb-Cre+ Mice—The ADAR1-3LoxP allele was created by homologous recombination in R1 ES cells using a positive-negative selection strategy (33Mansour S.L. Thomas R.T. Capecchi M.R. Nature. 1988; 336: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). ES cell lines selected for double resistance to G418 and ganciclovir were screened by Southern hybridization using three separate DNA probes specific for the 5′ and 3′ regions of the ADAR1 gene and Neo gene. Three separate ES cell clones harboring a floxed ADAR1 allele (ADAR1-3LoxP) were identified from a total of 162 clones examined. In vitro excision of the Neo cassette was done by transient transfection of one of those ES clones with a plasmid containing the cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer driven Cre gene. After two rounds of cloning, four independent ES cell clones carrying a new floxed ADAR1 allele without Neo (ADAR1-2LoxP) were identified by PCR genotyping. By using one of these ES clones, we generated a germ-line transmitting, male founder chimeric mouse, which led to establishment of heterozygote mice harboring the ADAR1-2LoxP allele (ADAR1wt/flox). Inter se cross of these heterozygote mice resulted in generation of ADAR1flox/flox mice, homozygous for ADAR1-2LoxP allele. Intercrossing ADAR1flox/flox mice with EIIa-Cre (34Lakso M. Pichel J.G. Gorman J.R. Sauer B. Okamoto Y. Lee E. Alt F.W. Westphal H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5860-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar) and Alb-Cre mice (35Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Genesis. 2000; 26: 149-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) led to generation of ADAR1wt/flox (ADAR1+/-) and ADAR1flox/flox/Alb-Cre+ mouse lines, respectively. PCR Genotyping—Genotypes carrying the ADAR1wt, ADAR1flox, or ADAR1del alleles were determined by PCR using 0.05 μg of DNA extracted from embryo tissues or tail tips and a primer set (PR-1, PR-2, PR-3, and PR-4). The presence of the Cre transgene was determined by including the primer set PRCre-1 and PRCre-2 during PCR. Genotyping for PKR (dsRNA-activated serine/threonine kinase) alleles was done using the primer set PKRE2S, PKRE2A, and Neo3′S. PCR cycle conditions used are as follows: 94 °C, 2 min for 1 cycle, 94 °C, 30 s; 71 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s for 30 cycles, and 72 °C, 5 min for 1 cycle. Blood Examination—Serum samples collected from 6-week-old ADAR1flox/flox/Alb-Cre and wild-type mice were analyzed for alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, albumin, amylase, creatine, glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides (Anilytics Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Preparation of ADAR1-/- ES Cells and Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEF)—Eighteen blastocyst embryos (E3.5) derived from intercrossing ADAR1+/- mice were trypsinized and replated onto primary fibroblast cells after in vitro culture for 2 days as described (36Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacey E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 253-290Google Scholar). Among the eight independent ES cell-like clones that survived and continued to proliferate during successive trypsinization and replating, one ADAR1+/+ clone, one ADAR1+/- clone, and two independent ADAR1-/- clones were identified by PCR genotyping. MEF cells were prepared from wild-type, ADAR1+/-, and ADAR1-/- E9.5 embryos, and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Serum Deprivation Treatment of MEF Cells—Wild-type, ADAR1+/-, and ADAR1-/- MEF cells grown on glass coverslips were washed with Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline, cultured in either complete medium (with 10% fetal calf serum) or serum-free medium for various times, and then examined with the TUNEL assay. Preparation of Embryonic Teratomas in SCID Mice—Five female BALB/c SCID mice (age, 6 weeks; Wistar Institute) were injected subcutaneously with 1 × 107 ES cells (cl3, ADAR1+/+; cl4, ADAR1-/-; or cl7, ADAR1+/-) in a volume of 0.1 ml (37Wang Q. Khillan J. Gadue P. Nishikura K. Science. 2000; 290: 1765-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). After 3 weeks, teratomas were recovered and processed for RNA extraction and for preparation of histology sections. RNA Editing Assay—Quantitation of editing efficiency at selected sites of GluR and 5-HT2CR RNAs extracted from teratomas was carried out by dideoxyoligonucleotide/primer extension assay as described previously except for use of new extension primers EXMRG (GluR-B, R/G site), EXMQR5 (GluR-5, Q/R site), and EXMQR6 (GluR-6, Q/R site) (8Wang Q.

The ratio of the edited and unedited RNAs was estimated by quantifying the radioactivity of the primer-extended products with a Phosphor Imaging System (Amersham Biosciences). Immunochemistry—Mouse embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. MEF cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) 15.8.6 raised against the middle region encompassing exons 2-7 of ADAR1 protein (38Raitskin O. Cho D.-S. Sperling J. Nishikura K. Sperling R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6571-6576Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was used for immunohistochemical analysis. Nonspecific mouse tissue staining was blocked using the M.O.M. Kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA). Primary antibody was detected using the horseradish peroxidase-labeled Biotin-Streptavidin Kit (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). Intracellular localization of ADAR1 was detected by serially labeling MEF cells with mAb 15.8.6 followed by Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Western Immunoblot Analysis—Western blot analysis was done using mAb 15.8.6 and the Renaissance® chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described (38Raitskin O. Cho D.-S. Sperling J. Nishikura K. Sperling R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6571-6576Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Blots were double immunostained with anti-β-tubulin mAb T-5293 (Sigma) for normalization of the ADAR1 expression levels. Detection of Apoptosis—Paraffin-embedded whole embryo or adult mouse liver sections were subjected to TUNEL staining using an In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche Applied Science). After labeling apoptotic cells with anti-fluorescein antibody-conjugated with alkaline phosphatase, the sections were counterstained with methyl green. Direct fluorescein labeling during the TUNEL reaction was used for detection of apoptotic MEF cells subjected to serum deprivation. Generation of Floxed ADAR1 and ADAR1+/- Heterozygous Mouse Lines—To investigate ADAR1 functions during development, a new floxed ADAR1 allele (ADAR1-2LoxP or ADAR1flox) was created in mice using the LoxP/Cre system (Fig. 1A). We first established a floxed ADAR1-3LoxP allele in R1 ES cells (Fig. 1B). Because the presence of the Neo cassette might interfere with the promoter activity and/or mRNA processing of the ADAR1 gene, the Neo cassette was deleted by in vitro transient transfection with a Cre expression vector, resulting in an ADAR1-2LoxP allele (ADAR1flox). Germ line chimeras and mice heterozygous for the ADAR1flox allele were obtained (Fig. 1C, lane 3). Heterozygous ADAR1flox mice were bred inter se, generating fertile and healthy ADAR1flox/flox (floxed ADAR1+/+) homozygote mice (Fig. 1C, lane 4). These mice harboring the ADAR1flox allele were crossed with a universal Cre deletor line EIIa-Cre (34Lakso M. Pichel J.G. Gorman J.R. Sauer B. Okamoto Y. Lee E. Alt F.W. Westphal H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

We expected that this cross would result in ADAR1+/- progeny bearing an embryonic lethal phenotype, considering our previous observation with high level chimeric embryos prepared with ADAR1+/- donor ES cells that died before E14 with anemia and liver degeneration (37Wang Q. Khillan J. Gadue P. Nishikura K. Science. 2000; 290: 1765-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). However, to our surprise healthy, live born ADAR1wt/del (ADAR1+/-) heterozygous mice were generated at normal Mendelian ratios after in vivo deletion of the ADAR1 C terminus by Cre recombinase (Fig. 1C, lane 5) (discussed below). Embryonic Lethal ADAR1-/- Mice—The intercrossing of ADAR1+/- F1 mice generated approximately a 2:1 ratio of live ADAR1+/- and wild-type mice (Table I). No live ADAR1-/- homozygotes, however, resulted from this intercross (Table I). Therefore, we analyzed staged embryo and were able to collect live wild type and ADAR1+/- (E9.5-12.5) and ADAR1-/- (E9.5-11.5) embryos. The expected ratio of live wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous embryos was recovered at E10.5 (Table I). However, a large proportion of ADAR1-/- embryos died around E11.0-12.0. These embryos, which presumably died, were grossly normal except for occasional pallor and reduced size. Surviving ADAR1-/- embryos appeared to be normal, although some embryo propers and yolk sac membranes were pale (Fig. 2A). At this embryonic stage (E11-12), the majority of circulating erythrocytes are yolk sac-derived (termed primitive). Examination of peripheral blood collected from E11.0 ADAR1-/- embryos revealed no morphological abnormalities of primitive erythrocytes indicating that their differentiation is qualitatively normal (Fig. 2B). Thus, the pallor observed in these embryos could be due to either hemorrhage or quantitative defects in primitive erythropoiesis. Hemorrhage was indeed detected in the abdominal cavity area of some ADAR1-/- embryos. We previously observed defects in definitive-type (fetal liver-derived) erythropoiesis associated with ADAR1 deficiency (37Wang Q. Khillan J. Gadue P. Nishikura K. Science. 2000; 290: 1765-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Early embryonic death precluded direct examination of fetal liver hematopoiesis in our ADAR1-/- embryos. However, definitive hematopoietic progenitors are also present in embryonic yolk sac (39Orkin S.H. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 40Palis J. Robertson S. Kennedy M. Wall C. Keller G. Development. 1999; 126: 5073-5084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, colony-forming progenitor assays were carried out with E9.5 yolk sacs. No significant differences in the numbers of definitive erythroid and myeloid progenitors were found among ADAR1-/-, ADAR1+/-, and wild-type embryos (Fig. 2C), suggesting that definitive hematopoiesis is intrinsically normal in the absence of ADAR1. Thus, the nearly complete block to definitive erythropoiesis that we observed previously in ADAR1-deficient embryos could be due to defects in the fetal liver microenvironment (37Wang Q. Khillan J. Gadue P. Nishikura K. Science. 2000; 290: 1765-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar).Table IGenotype analysis of progeny from ADAR1+/−heterozygous intercrossesAgeWild-type (+/+), liveHeterozygous (+/−), liveHomozygous (−/−)LiveDead>1 week3161E12.513164E11.51544812E11.02044125E10.5102514E9.56128 Open table in a new tab Widespread Apoptosis in ADAR1-/- Embryos—Histological examination of ADAR1-/- embryos revealed aberrant features noted previously in the fetal livers of ADAR1+/- chimeras (e.g. decreased density of hepatocytes) (37Wang Q. Khillan J. Gadue P. Nishikura K. Science. 2000; 290: 1765-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Many of these liver cells possessed pyknotic nuclei, a key hallmark of cells that die from apoptosis (Fig. 3B). Subsequent immunohistochemical examination using the TUNEL assay revealed that many tissues including vertebra and heart had undergone apoptosis (Fig. 3F). The highest levels of apoptosis were detected within the liver for both hepatocytes and hematopoietic cells, possibly contributing to the anemic appearance of these embryos (Fig. 3H). Apoptosis was detected even within the primordial livers of some ADAR1-/- embryos collected at E10.5, although the gross outward appearance of these embryos was indistinguishable from that of wild-type embryos (data not shown). In order to demonstrate that the elevated apoptosis was caused by ADAR1 deficiency and not due to aberrant ADAR1 products generated by the gene targeting maneuver, we then conducted real time reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments using total RNA samples extracted from E11.0 embryos, in an attempt to detect aberrant ADAR1 transcripts derived from the ADAR1 null allele. Two sets of PCR primers were used: one set consisted of a sense primer located in exon 5 and an antisense primer located in exon 10, and another set consisted of a sense primer located in exon 11 and an antisense primer located in the 3′-UTR. We detected PCR products corresponding to spliced mRNAs encompassing exons 5-10 in wild-type embryos as expected. PCR products corresponding to aberrant ADAR1 transcripts containing sequences encompassing spliced exons 5-11, intron 11, and the 3′-UTR, anticipated to be synthesized from the ADAR1-/- allele, were also detected at a level equal to PCR products derived from normal mRNAs in ADAR1+/+ embryos (data not shown). By using an ADAR1-specific mAb, we next conducted immunostaining and Western blot analysis to see whether their translation products were detectable. The mAb used for these experiments was raised against the region corresponding to E2 to E7, and thus it should recognize both normal ADAR1 and truncated ADAR1 proteins that contain dsRNA binding domains (E2 to E7), if they are stable enough to be present at detectable levels. However, no truncated ADAR1 proteins were detected in ADAR1-/- embryos by immunostaining (Fig. 3D) an"
https://openalex.org/W1993481663,"Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (consisting of mGluR1 and mGluR5) are G-protein-coupled neurotransmitter receptors that are found in the perisynaptic region of the postsynaptic membrane. These receptors are not activated by single synaptic volleys but rather require bursts of activity. They are implicated in many forms of neural plasticity including hippocampal long-term potentiation and depression, cerebellar long-term depression, associative learning, and cocaine addiction. When activated, group I mGluRs engage two G-protein-dependent signalling mechanisms: stimulation of phospholipase C and activation of an unidentified, mixed-cation excitatory postsynaptic conductance (EPSC), displaying slow activation, in the plasma membrane. Here we report that the mGluR1-evoked slow EPSC is mediated by the TRPC1 cation channel. TRPC1 is expressed in perisynaptic regions of the cerebellar parallel fibre-Purkinje cell synapse and is physically associated with mGluR1. Manipulations that interfere with TRPC1 block the mGluR1-evoked slow EPSC in Purkinje cells; however, fast transmission mediated by AMPA-type glutamate receptors remains unaffected. Furthermore, co-expression of mGluR1 and TRPC1 in a heterologous system reconstituted a mGluR1-evoked conductance that closely resembles the slow EPSC in Purkinje cells."

https://openalex.org/W2038784909,"Silymarin, a defined mixture of natural flavonoid, has recently been shown to have potent cancer chemopreventive efficacy against colon carcinogenesis in rat model; however, the mechanism of such efficacy is not elucidated. Here, using pure active agent in silymarin, namely silibinin, we show its antiproliferative and apoptotic effects, and associated molecular alterations in human colon carcinoma HT-29 cells. Silibinin treatment of cells at 50-100 microg/ml doses resulted in a moderate to very strong growth inhibition in a dose- and a time-dependent manner, which was largely due to a G0/G1 arrest in cell cycle progression; higher dose and longer treatment time also caused a G2/M arrest. In mechanistic studies related its effect on cell cycle progression, silibinin treatment resulted in an upregulation of Kip1/p27 and Cip1/p21 protein as well as mRNA levels, and decreased CDK2, CDK4, cyclin E and cyclin D1 protein levels together with an inhibition in CDK2 and CDK4 kinase activities. In other studies, we observed that G2/M arrest by silibinin was associated with a decrease in cdc25C, cdc2/p34 and cyclin B1 protein levels, as well as cdc2/p34 kinase activity. In the studies assessing biological fate of silibinin-treated cells, silibinin-induced cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition were not associated with cellular differentiation, but caused apoptotic death. The quantitative apoptosis analysis showed up to 15% apoptotic cell death after 48 h of silibinin treatment. Interestingly, silibinin-induced apoptosis in HT-29 cells was independent of caspases activation, as all caspases inhibitor did not reverse silibinin-induced apoptosis. This observation was further confirmed by the findings showing a lack in caspases activity increase and caspases and PARP cleavage as well as a lack in cytochrome c release in cytosol following silibinin treatment of HT-29 cells. Additional studies conducted in mice showed that silibinin doses found effective in HT-29 cells are achievable in plasma, which increases the significance of the present findings and their possible translation in in vivo anticancer efficacy of silibinin against colon cancer. Together, these results identify molecular mechanisms of silibinin efficacy as a cell cycle regulator and apoptosis inducer in human colon carcinoma HT-29 cells, and justify further studies to investigate potential usefulness of this nontoxic agent in colon cancer prevention and intervention."

The structure of the soluble form of CLIC1 is typical of a soluble glutathione S-transferase superfamily protein but contains a glutaredoxin-like active site. In this study we show that on oxidation CLIC1 undergoes a reversible transition from a monomeric to a non-covalent dimeric state due to the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond (Cys-24–Cys-59). We have determined the crystal structure of this oxidized state and show that a major structural transition has occurred, exposing a large hydrophobic surface, which forms the dimer interface.

A conserved C-terminal CLIC module of ∼240 amino acids is present in each member of the family with several members containing additional, unrelated N-terminal domains. Most CLICs are localized to intracellular membranes and have been linked to functions including apoptosis, pH, and cell cycle regulation (4Fernandez-Salas E. Suh K.S. Speransky V.V. Bowers W.L.

The CLIC ion channels are unusual in that they possess both soluble and integral membrane forms (2Valenzuela S.M. Martin D.K. Por S.B. Robbins J.M. Warton K. Bootcov M.R. Schofield P.R. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12575-12582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In this regard they are similar to some bacterial toxins and several classes of intracellular proteins including Bcl-xL and the annexins (7Gouaux E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 566-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Our understanding of how such dual natured proteins enter the membrane is limited by the dearth of high resolution structures for key states in this process. We have recently determined the crystal structure of a soluble monomeric form of CLIC1 (8Harrop S.J. DeMaere M.Z. Fairlie W.D. Reztsova T. Valenzuela S.M. Mazzanti M. Tonini R. Qiu M.R. Jankova L. Warton K. Bauskin A.R. Wu W.M. Pankhurst S. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. Curmi P.M. J. Biol.

Curtis S. Chelvanayagam G. Board P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3319-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This soluble form of CLIC1 consists of two domains, the N-domain possessing a thioredoxin fold closely resembling glutaredoxin and an all α-helical C-domain, which is typical of the GST superfamily. CLIC1 contains an intact glutathione-binding site that was shown to covalently bind glutathione via a conserved CLIC cysteine residue, Cys-24. This led to the suggestion that CLIC1 function may be under redox control, possibly via reactive oxygen or nitrogen species. The structure and stoichiometry of the integral membrane form of the CLIC proteins is still unclear. Electrophysiology of purified, soluble (Escherichia coli-expressed) recombinant CLIC1 in reconstituted artificial bilayers shows that CLIC1 alone is sufficient for chloride ion channel formation (8Harrop S.J.

Electrophysiological studies of FLAG epitope-tagged CLIC1 in the plasma membranes of Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells suggest an extracellular N terminus and a cytoplasmic C terminus (13Tonini R. Ferroni A. Valenzuela S.M. Warton K. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. Mazzanti M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These experiments imply that in the channel form of the protein, CLIC1, crosses the membrane an odd number of times. One or possibly two putative transmembrane helices have been postulated to form the membrane-spanning region(s) of the CLIC module (2Valenzuela S.M. Martin D.K. Por S.B. Robbins J.M. Warton K.

The most conserved of these putative TM regions (residues 24–46; CLIC1 numbering) is located within the N-terminal domain and contains Cys-24, which is at the center of the glutathione-binding site. In the structure of the monomeric soluble form of CLIC1, this putative N-terminal transmembrane segment forms an α helix (h1) and β-strand (s2) within the glutaredoxin-like N-domain (8Harrop S.J. DeMaere M.Z. Fairlie W.D. Reztsova T. Valenzuela S.M. Mazzanti M. Tonini R. Qiu M.R. Jankova L. Warton K. Bauskin A.R. Wu W.M. Pankhurst S. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. Curmi P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44993-45000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Thus, CLIC1 is likely to undergo a large scale structural rearrangement on transiting to the integral membrane form. This structural change may involve the N-domain of CLIC1 and, hence, disrupt the glutathione-binding site. We note that this transmembrane segment is only putative, and other hypotheses exist as to how CLIC1 is transformed into an integral membrane ion channel protein (11Tulk B.M. Kapadia S. Edwards J.C. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this paper we examine the effect of oxidation on the structure of CLIC1. Incubation with H2O2 results in the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond and non-covalent dimerization. This transition is reversible on reduction. We present the crystal structure of this soluble, oxidized dimeric form of CLIC1 at 1.8-Å resolution. The structure is markedly different from the soluble, monomeric form in that the glutaredoxin-like N-domain has undergone a radical rearrangement to expose an extended hydrophobic surface, which forms the dimer interface. This transition is stabilized through the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond between two originally distant cysteine residues, Cys-24 and Cys-59. The dimer forms chloride ion channels in artificial lipid bilayers that are similar to the native channel. Finally, we show that purified CLIC1 cannot form ion channels in lipid bilayers under reducing conditions and that mutation of either Cys-24 or Cys-59 to serine results in the loss of channel activity. Expression, Purification, and Oxidation of CLIC1—Recombinant GST-CLIC1 fusion proteins (wild type and mutants) were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS using the pGEX-4T-1 vector (2Valenzuela S.M. Martin D.K. Por S.B. Robbins J.M. Warton K. Bootcov M.R. Schofield P.R. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12575-12582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The fusion protein was purified from the cell lysis supernatant by binding to glutathione S-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and cleaved using bovine plasma thrombin (Sigma). Protein was further purified at 4 °C by gel filtration on a Superdex G75 column (Amersham Biosciences) preequilibrated with 10 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm NaN3 at pH 7.0. The resulting peak at 30 kDa corresponding to monomeric CLIC1 was dialyzed at 4 °C into 1× phosphate-buffered saline and concentrated to 15 mg/ml. The final product consisted of the wild-type CLIC1 sequence with an extra two residues at the N terminus (Gly-Ser) as a result of the thrombin cleavage site in the fusion construct. Oxidation Experiments—To examine the effect of hydrogen peroxide treatment on CLIC1, a 20 mm stock solution of hydrogen peroxide was prepared immediately before use then added at a final concentration of 2 mm to typically 20–50 μl of the purified protein (∼2 mg/ml) in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and incubated for various time periods at room temperature. After incubation the proteins were either analyzed directly by gel filtration chromatography as described below or reduced by the addition of DTT to a final concentration of 50 mm and incubated for a further 1 h at room temperature before gel filtration. For gel filtration chromatography analysis untreated and oxidized proteins were diluted to 200 μl final volume before injection onto a Superose 12 (HR 10/30, Amersham Biosciences) column preequilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, at 0.5 ml/min. Proteins were detected by absorbance at 280 nm. The column was calibrated with the standard proteins carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), and the column void volume was determined from the elution time of blue dextran (2 × 106 kDa). Electrophoresis was performed either under non-denaturing conditions using 10% native polyacrylamide gels or under denaturing conditions by SDS-PAGE on 15% gels. Samples were electrophoresed either unreduced or reduced by the addition of 50 mm DTT to the sample buffer. Bands were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Crystallization of the Oxidized CLIC1 Dimer—CLIC1 was oxidized by the addition of H2O2 to a final concentration of 2 mm in phosphate-buffered saline solution. The protein was incubated under oxidizing conditions for 5 min at 18 °C before dialyzing against 10 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm NaN3 at pH 7.0 for 2 h at 4 °C and purified on a Superdex G75 column preequilibrated in the same buffer. Protein eluted as two peaks corresponding to dimeric (60 kDa) and monomeric (30 kDa) CLIC1. The dimeric fraction was passed over the Superdex G75 column a second time, and the resulting single 60kDa peak was concentrated, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Crystals were obtained at 4 °C by sitting drop vapor diffusion with 5 μl of protein (7.6 mg ml-1) plus 5 μl of reservoir solution (14% w/v polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 5000 (Hampton Research), 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5). Crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen after a serial transfer into cryoprotectant consisting of reservoir solution plus 10% v/v polyethylene glycol 400 and 300 mg ml-1 d-glucose (ICN Biomedicals). Diffraction data were obtained at 100 K on a DIP2030 imaging plate mounted on a Nonius rotating anode generator using copper Cu Kα radiation and focusing mirrors.

Chloride Efflux Experiments—400-nm unilamellar liposomes (soybean phosphatidylcholine:cholesterol 9:1 w:w; Sigma P-5638 and C-8662, respectively) containing 200 mm KCl, 2 mm HEPES, pH 6.5, were prepared by extrusion (Avestin Lipofast extruder) and extravesicular chloride removed by desalting on Bio-Gel P-6DG spin columns (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in “assay buffer” (330 mm sucrose, 2 mm HEPES, pH 6.5). A chloride selective electrode (Radiometer Pacific) was used to monitor chloride efflux from the vesicles upon the addition of freshly prepared CLIC1 equilibrated in assay buffer. In each experiment protein (30 μg/ml final concentration) was added to the liposomes followed by 3 μm valinomycin to initiate potential driven chloride efflux. After 2 min, Triton X-100 was added to 0.1% to release all vesicle contents.

Qiu M.R. Wu W.M. Pankhurst S. Bauskin A.R. Harrop S.J. Campbell T.J. Curmi P.M. Breit S.N. Mazzanti M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26003-26011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Treated patch-clamp pipettes were dipped into a phospholipid monolayer (diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine; Avanti Polar Lipids #850356) until pipette resistance exceeded 5 gigaohms. CLIC1 was added to the bath (final concentration of 2 μg ml-1) with the same solution in both the bath and pipette (140 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 6). Axopatch 1D and Pclamp 7 (Axon, Novato, CA) were used to record and analyze single-channel currents (recordings digitized at 5 kHz and filter at 800 Hz). Channel characterization was based on recordings that lasted more than 15 min, giving sufficient data to obtain a reproducible analysis. Reversible Redox-induced Dimerization of CLIC1—A feature of CLIC1 is that it possesses a glutaredoxin-like active site, suggesting that its function may be under redox control (8Harrop S.J. DeMaere M.Z. Fairlie W.D. Reztsova T. Valenzuela S.M. Mazzanti M. Tonini R. Qiu M.R. Jankova L. Warton K. Bauskin A.R. Wu W.M. Pankhurst S. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. Curmi P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44993-45000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To investigate this we have studied the effect of reactive oxygen species on CLIC1. Purified recombinant CLIC1 was incubated at room temperature in the presence of 2 mm hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for various times and then analyzed by gel filtration chromatography. Untreated protein eluted as a monomer (Fig. 1A), whereas the addition of H2O2 resulted in the appearance of a CLIC1 dimer (Fig. 1B) comprising approximately two-thirds of the total protein (the proportion was unchanged between 5 min and 6 h of incubation with H2O2). Dimerization was completely reversed by reduction with 50 mm DTT (1 h, room temperature; Fig. 1C). Electrophoresis showed that the observed dimer is not primarily due to an interchain disulfide bond(s) (Fig. 1D), although a minor amount of such material is always present in CLIC1 samples (Fig. 1D, non-reducing SDS-PAGE). Structure of the Oxidized Dimer of CLIC1—The structure of the oxidized dimeric form of CLIC1 was determined at 1.8 Å of resolution (Fig. 2; Table I). The crystal contains one dimer per asymmetric unit, with the two subunits nearly identical (root mean square deviation of 0.34 Å excluding residues 147–164). The dimer is ∼75 Å long and 25 Å wide and tapers in height from 45 Å at each end to 20 Å in the middle (Fig. 2D). The structure is all helical, and the dimer interface occurs between the two newly configured N-domains. The arrangement of the subunits bears no relationship to that seen in GST dimers (20Wilce M.C. Parker M.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1205: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Comparison of the CLIC1 Monomer and Dimer Structures—The formation of the oxidized dimer has produced a dramatic change in the conformation of CLIC1 (Fig. 3, A–C). The two C-domains (residues 92–241) show only minor alterations. In contrast, the N-domain has undergone a radical structural rearrangement, including the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys-24 and Cys-59 (Fig. 2, B and C). In the monomer, the sulfhydryl groups of these two residues are separated by 13.1 Å (Ref. 8Harrop S.J. DeMaere M.Z. Fairlie W.D. Reztsova T. Valenzuela S.M. Mazzanti M. Tonini R. Qiu M.R. Jankova L. Warton K. Bauskin A.R. Wu W.M. Pankhurst S. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. Curmi P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44993-45000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Cys-24 is conserved in all CLICs, where it is at the center of the glutathione-binding site in the monomeric form, whereas Cys-59 is unique to CLIC1, corresponding to a conserved Ala in all other CLICs (Fig. 2E). The most apparent structural change between the monomer and dimer is the disappearance of the β-sheet (Fig. 3, A–C). In the dimer there is no electron density for the first 22 residues (β-strand 1 in monomer), and helix 2 is extended by an extra 2 turns to include residues starting at Thr-44 (originally β-strand 2; Fig. 2E). Residues 60–77 between helices 2 and 3 (β-strands 3 and 4 of the monomer) form an extended loop loosely packed against the C-domain in the dimer (Figs. 2D and 3B). This loop covers a tunnel filled with ordered water molecules. Dimer Interface—The dimer interface buries ∼2200 Å2 of accessible surface (per dimer), and it is predominantly hydrophobic, consisting of two flat sheets of 4 α-helices, where each sheet comprises helices 8, 1, and 3 from one subunit and helix 2 from the other subunit (Fig. 2C). The interface is formed between the sheets of helices, and although the two sheets are approximately parallel, they are rotated with respect to each other by around 60° (Fig. 2C). The interface can be broken into three concentric areas (Fig. 4A). The outermost section is lined with charged/polar residues contributed by helices 2 and 3, forming several intermolecular salt bridges. The next ring-like section consists of a tightly packed hydrophobic region dominated by two symmetry-related columns of stacked aromatic residues (Phe-83 from helix 3 slots into a hydrophobic pocket formed by Phe-26 and Phe-31 of helix 1 plus Val-55 and Leu-58 of helix 2; Fig. 4B). Inside this tightly packed ring there is a central hydrophobic patch composed of Leu, Ile, and Val residues contributed by helices 1 and 3. This patch is not entirely complementary across the dimer symmetry axis, resulting in an occluded cavity that is devoid of ordered water molecules (Fig. 4, A and B). Most of the hydrophobic residues at the interface are conserved within the CLIC family, except Phe-26 and Trp-35 (Ser and Leu, respectively, in CLIC3). Monomer-Dimer Structural Transition—To understand the structural transition, the Ramachandran maps of the two structures were compared (Fig. 3, D–F). A Ramachandran distance was computed and plotted as a function of residue number (Fig. 2E). In the C-domain there are only two regions that show large Ramachandran distances. In contrast, most of the N-domain has undergone significant shifts in Ramachandran space with the exception of the residues in helices 1, 2, and 3 that are common to both structures. The major changes in the N-domain are primarily due to the transition of residues from the β-sheet region of Ramachandran space into less constrained loop structures with α-helical characteristics (Fig. 3F). The Ramachandran distance plot can also be used to identify hinge regions that facilitate structural transitions. The Ramachandran distances are mapped onto backbone representations of the CLIC1 monomer and dimer structures (Fig. 3, D and E). Residues not observed in the electron density of the dimer are colored in gold on the monomer backbone trace (Fig. 3D). In the monomer structure most of the hinge regions reside in the N-domain, near the glutathione-binding site (pink regions, Fig. 3D). Reduction Prevents Channel Function—To ascertain its functionality the oxidized dimer was tested for its ability to form Cl- channels. Chloride efflux measurements from liposomes show that the dimer protein produced a significantly larger chloride flux than an equivalent concentration of monomer (Fig. 4C and Table II). Tip dip electrophysiological studies show that both the monomer and the dimer produce ion channels in artificial bilayers (Fig. 5) that are indistinguishable from the channels seen in inside-out patches from Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with CLIC1 (13Tonini R.

The calculated probabilities assume a binomial distribution Open table in a new tab Tip dip channel recording experiments were repeated in the presence of DTT. The probability of observing channel activity was reduced dramatically for both monomer and dimer in the presence of 5 mm DTT (Fig. 5E). Presumably the presence of DTT converts CLIC1 to the monomer form, which is then non-functional under reducing conditions. As a corollary of this, the channel activity observed for CLIC1 monomer is likely due to the effect of oxidation occurring in the absence of reducing agents. Cys-24 and Cys-59 Are Essential for Dimer Formation and Channel Activity—To investigate whether disulfide bond formation is essential for channel activity the following mutant proteins were produced: C24S, C59S, and C89S. On the addition of H2O2 neither C24S nor C59S produced a CLIC1 dimer (Fig. 1E). Chloride flux measurements show that both C24S and C59S are inactive as channels, whereas C89S is indistinguishable from wild-type CLIC1 monomer (Table II). The same mutants were examined by tip dip electrophysiology. In keeping with the chloride efflux experiments channels were only observed for C89S (Table II). Statistical analysis using a binomial distribution shows that in the electrophysiological experiments C24S and C59S differ from the wild-type protein at better than the 99.9th percentile (Table II). Thus, under the conditions investigated (in particular, lipid composition) both Cys-24 and Cys-59 are essential for CLIC1 channel activity. Our results imply that oxidation is essential for the transition of CLIC1 from the monomer to the integral membrane chloride channel form, requiring both Cys-24 and Cys-59. This suggests that the formation of the intramolecular disulfide bond between these residues is essential for the transition. The dimer structure shows that oxidation results in a large structural alteration in CLIC1 that exposes a new hydrophobic surface that is masked in vitro by non-covalent dimerization. In vivo this hydrophobic surface may represent the membrane-docking interface. Based on these results we propose the following model for the transition between monomeric, soluble CLIC1 and the integral membrane channel form. The monomeric form maintains a GST-like structure, but the N-terminal domain occasionally transits to the conformation observed in the dimer structure. In the presence of reactive oxygen species, this altered conformation becomes trapped via the formation of the intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys-24 and Cys-59. This new, monomeric state will be unstable in solution due to the large exposed hydrophobic surface. In the presence of a lipid bilayer the conformationally altered CLIC1 monomer will dock to the membrane, whereas in the absence of lipids it will dimerize. Competition between these two processes will depend on the concentration of CLIC1 and the effective concentration of lipid bilayers. Once CLIC1 docks to the membrane it can undergo further structural changes to produce the integral membrane chloride channel form of the protein. A precedent for ion channels that are controlled by local concentrations of intracellular reactive oxygen species is the Ca2+ ion channel in plant root hair cells of Arabidopsis thaliana (21Foreman J. Demidchik V. Bothwell J.H.F. Mylona P. Miedema H. Torres M.A. Linstead P. Costa S. Brownlee C. Jones J.D.G. Davies J.M. Dolan L. Nature. 2003; 422: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Our working model for CLIC1 is speculative and will require further experimental verification. In vivo the membrane integration of CLIC1 is likely to be more complex and will probably involve other molecules. A major unanswered question is, what is the structure of the integral membrane CLIC ion channel? Several alternative models have been proposed for the structure of the membrane inserted CLIC proteins (8Harrop S.J. DeMaere M.Z. Fairlie W.D. Reztsova T. Valenzuela S.M. Mazzanti M. Tonini R. Qiu M.R. Jankova L. Warton K. Bauskin A.R. Wu W.M. Pankhurst S. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. Curmi P.M. J. Biol.

Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Sequence analyses indicated that Cys-24 to Val-46 might form a transmembrane helix in the channel state (13Tonini R. Ferroni A. Valenzuela S.M. Warton K. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. Mazzanti M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Previously, this seemed unlikely due to the GST-like monomer structure (8Harrop S.J. DeMaere M.Z. Fairlie W.D. Reztsova T. Valenzuela S.M. Mazzanti M. Tonini R. Qiu M.R. Jankova L. Warton K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44993-45000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), which would require an unfolding of the N-domain on membrane insertion. Our present structure indicates that such an unfolding is indeed possible. However, membrane integration may also require unfolding of the C-domain (11Tulk B.M. Kapadia S. Edwards J.C. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The structural change observed in the monomer-to-dimer transition in CLIC1 is quite radical. Similar large scale conformational editing through redox switching has been observed in the E. coli H2O2 transcription factor, OxyR (22Choi H. Kim S. Mukhopadhyay P. Cho S. Woo J. Storz G. Ryu S. Cell. 2001; 105: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Furthermore, reconciliation of biochemical evidence and the location of catalytic cysteine residues in the thioredoxin-like structure of peroxiredoxin 5 necessitate a conformational change during peroxide reduction (23Declercq J.P. Evrard C. Clippe A. Stricht D.V. Bernard A. Knoops B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The rearrangement of the β-sheet observed for CLIC1 may, therefore, not be a unique feature of the CLIC protein family but, rather, a structural duality capable of being tolerated by the thioredoxin fold of some proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2093650005,"The cloning and characterization of the common fragile site (CFS) FRA6E (6q26) identified Parkin, the gene involved in the pathogenesis of many cases of juvenile, early-onset and, rarely, late-onset Parkinson's disease, as the third large gene to be localized within a large CFS. Initial analyses of Parkin indicated that in addition to playing a role in Parkinson's disease, it might also be involved in the development and/or progression of ovarian cancer. These analyses also indicated striking similarities among the large CFS-locus genes: fragile histidine triad gene (FHIT; 3p14.2), WW domain-containing oxidoreductase gene (WWOX; 16q23), and Parkin (6q26). Analyses of FHIT and WWOX in a variety of different cancer types have identified the presence of alternative transcripts with whole exon deletions. Interestingly, various whole exon duplications and deletions have been identified for Parkin in juvenile and early-onset Parkinson's patients. Therefore, we performed mutational/exon rearrangement analysis of Parkin in ovarian cancer cell lines and primary tumors. Four (66.7%) cell lines and four (18.2%) primary tumors were identified as being heterozygous for the duplication or deletion of a Parkin exon. Additionally, three of 23 (13.0%) nonovarian tumor-derived cell lines were also identified as having a duplication or deletion of one or more Parkin exons. Analysis of Parkin protein expression with antibodies revealed that most of the ovarian cancer cell lines and primary tumors had diminished or absent Parkin expression. While functional analyses have not yet been performed for Parkin, these data suggest that like FHIT and WWOX, Parkin may represent a tumor suppressor gene."
https://openalex.org/W2078190520,"In the absence and in the resolution of inflammatory responses, neutrophils rapidly undergo spontaneous apoptosis. Here we report about a new apoptosis pathway in these cells that requires calpain-1 activation and is essential for the enzymatic activation of the critical effector caspase-3. Decreased levels of calpastatin, a highly specific intrinsic inhibitor of calpain, resulted in activation of calpain-1, but not calpain-2, in neutrophils undergoing apoptosis, a process that was blocked by a specific calpain-1 inhibitor or by intracellular delivery of a calpastatin peptide. Further support for the importance of the calpastatin-calpain system was obtained by analyzing neutrophils from patients with cystic fibrosis that exhibited delayed apoptosis, associated with markedly increased calpastatin and decreased calpain-1 protein levels compared with neutrophils from control individuals. Additional studies were designed to place calpain-1 into the hierarchy of biochemical events leading to neutrophil apoptosis. Pharmacological calpain inhibition during spontaneous and Fas receptor-induced neutrophil apoptosis prevented cleavage of Bax into an 18-kDa fragment unable to interact with Bcl-xL. Moreover, calpain blocking prevented the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and Smac, which was indispensable for caspase-3 processing and enzymatic activation, both in the presence and absence of agonistic anti-Fas receptor antibodies. Taken together, calpastatin and calpain-1 represent critical proximal elements in a cascade of pro-apoptotic events leading to Bax, mitochondria, and caspase-3 activation, and their altered expression appears to influence the life span of neutrophils under pathologic conditions.

Neutrophils are important players within the innate immune system. Neutrophil products are often toxic, inasmuch as they are made for killing microorganisms. As targeting of the toxic neutrophil products is not specific, inflammatory responses are associated with more or less tissue damage (1Weiss S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar). To reduce neutrophil numbers, for instance after successful removal of the antigenic initiators of an inflammatory response, a safe removal of the cells is required. Such removal occurs through apoptosis, a form of cell death that prevents the release of inflammatory mediators from the dying cell and, therefore, limits tissue damage (2Savill J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 3Simon H.-U. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 193: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Clearly, any failure in the process of neutrophil apoptosis would result in additional and/or persistent inflammation. Delayed neutrophil apoptosis has been associated with several acute and chronic inflammatory diseases and appears to largely be mediated by overexpression of survival factors for these cells (4Dibbert B. Weber M. Nikolaizik W.H. Vogt P. Schöni M.H. Blaser K. Simon H.-U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13330-13335Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 5Coxon A. Tang T. Mayadas T.N. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The induction of neutrophil apoptosis during the resolution of a neutrophilic inflammatory response can be mimicked in vitro by culturing the cells in the absence of sufficient amounts of survival factors, a process that is called spontaneous apoptosis. Spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis can be enhanced by Fas receptor stimulation (6Iwai K. Miyawaki T. Takizawa T. Konno A. Ohta K. Yachie A. Taniguchi N. Blood. 1994; 84: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Watson R.W.G. O'Neill A. Brannigen A.E. Coffey R. Marshall J.C. Brady H.R. Fitzpatrick J.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Both spontaneous and Fas receptor-mediated neutrophil apoptosis involves the activation of a family of cysteine proteases, which cut cellular substrates at an obligatory aspartic acid within a preferred sequence (8Daigle I. Simon H.-U. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 2001; 126: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Members of this family are the so-called caspases. Caspases have been shown to cut cellular substrates by limited proteolysis that results in either activation or inactivation, but not degradation, of proteins involved in RNA splicing, DNA repair, maintenance of cell structure, and others (9Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6191) Google Scholar). Their action in apoptosis appears to be critical. Inhibitor studies, however, have provided functional evidence for the importance of other proteases in the execution of apoptosis as well (10Knepper-Nicolai B. Savill J. Brown S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30530-30536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Recently a significant focus has been directed toward calpain, a non-caspase cysteine protease with several isoforms (11Saido T.C. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 12Squier M.K.T. Cohen J.J. Cell Death Differ. 1996; 3: 275-283PubMed Google Scholar). The ubiquitous calpain isoforms are calpain-1 (calpain I, μ-calpain) and calpain-2 (calpain II, m-calpain), distinguished by their in vitro calcium requirements. Both calpain-1 and calpain-2 are heterodimers consisting of a calcium-binding catalytic 80-kDa subunit and a regulatory 30-kDa subunit, which is functionally essential (13Arthur J.S.C. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). There is accumulating evidence for the involvement of calpain in several physiological processes such as cell-cycle regulation, activation of transcription factors, differentiation, and apoptosis (11Saido T.C. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 12Squier M.K.T. Cohen J.J. Cell Death Differ. 1996; 3: 275-283PubMed Google Scholar). Calpain has been described as an upstream regulator of apoptosis based on the observation that dexamethasone-induced thymocyte apoptosis was prevented by calpain inhibitors, whereas DNA fragmentation in isolated thymocyte nuclei was not (14Squier M.K.T. Cohen J.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3690-3697PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Bax, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family involved in triggering apoptosis via mitochondria, has been identified as a target of calpain in HL-60 (15Wood D.E. Thomas A. Devi L.A. Berman Y. Beavis R.C. Reed J.C. Newcomb E.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1069-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and Jurkat cells (16Gao G. Dou Q.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 80: 53-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Whereas in HL-60 cells Bax cleavage into an 18-kDa fragment occurred several hours after cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and retinoblastoma protein (15Wood D.E. Thomas A. Devi L.A. Berman Y. Beavis R.C. Reed J.C. Newcomb E.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1069-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), the results reported in Jurkat cells suggested that the generation of the 18-kDa Bax fragment is an early event required for the induction of apoptosis via mitochondria (16Gao G.

Here, we demonstrate that calpain-1, but not calpain-2, is activated in spontaneous and Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis of neutrophils. We show that calpain-1 activation involves caspase-dependent proteolysis of calpastatin, generates an 18-kDa cleavage product of Bax unable to interact with anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL, and is required for mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and Smac as well as subsequent enzymatic caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. Moreover, neutrophils purified from patients with a systemic inflammatory disease (cystic fibrosis) provide evidence for decreased activity of the calpain-calpastatin system associated with delayed apoptosis.

In other experiments cells were incubated with the caspase-8 inhibitor z-IETD-fmk (50 μm) or the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (50 μm). Me2SO was always used as a solvent control. In the experiments in which agonistic anti-Fas receptor monoclonal antibodies (1 μg/ml CH11, Beckman Coulter International S.A., Nyon, Switzerland) were added, the inhibitors were given 1 h before Fas receptor stimulation.

In Vitro Autolytic Digestion of Purified Calpain-1—Purified procalpain-1 was dissolved in digestion buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Calbiochem). The digestions were stopped by adding Tris-glycine loading buffer, and aliquots were subjected to gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation—Neutrophils (5 × 107) were washed with PBS and buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 143 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, phosphatases, and proteases inhibitors), and then lysed in buffer A plus 0.2% Nonidet P-40 on ice for 30 min. Cell lysates were precleared with 100 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) at 4 °C for 1 h. Immunoprecipitation was performed using 5 μl of affinity-purified rabbit anti-human Bcl-xL S18 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., LabForce, Nunningen, Switzerland) in the presence of 2.5 mg/ml ovalbumin at 4 °C for 2h. Fifty μl of a 50% protein A-Sepharose suspension were added and the immunocomplexes captured on a rotating wheel at 4 °C for 90 min. Immunocomplexes were washed three times in buffer A and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min before loading on 12% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands). Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Neutrophils (5 × 106) were washed with PBS, lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS in PBS) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture with frequent vortexing on ice for 40 min, including two freeze/thaw cycles using a methanol/dry ice bath. After a 10-min centrifugation step to remove insoluble particles, equal amounts of the cell lysates were loaded on Tris-glycine gels or NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen). Separated proteins were electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilion-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The filters were incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature for 2 h or at 4 °C (overnight) in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 3% nonfat dry milk. The primary antibodies were polyclonal anti-Bax, detecting amino acids 43-61 (15Wood D.E. Thomas A. Devi L.A. Berman Y. Beavis R.C. Reed J.C. Newcomb E.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1069-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar); polyclonal anti-caspase-3 (both 1/1000 and from BD Biosciences, Pharmingen); monoclonal anti-calpain-1 antibody (1/1000; Chemicon, Temecula, CA); monoclonal anti-calpain-1 antibody (1/200; detecting latent and activated forms (Ref. 31Saido T.C.

Elce, Queens University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada); monoclonal anti-calpain-2 antibody (1/500; Sigma); and monoclonal anti-calpastatin antibody (1/400; Chemicon). For loading controls, stripped filters were incubated with a monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (1/10,000; Sigma). Filters were washed in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 for 30 min and incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences, Dübendorf, Switzerland) in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h. Filters were developed by an ECL technique (ECL Kit, Amersham Biosciences) according to instructions from the manufacturer. Densitometry Analysis—Cleavage of calpastatin was analyzed by densitometry using nonsaturated chemiluminescence exposed films and NIH Image 1.9 software. OD values of calpastatin bands divided by the OD of the corresponding β-actin band are expressed as percentage of OD(calpastatin)/OD(β-actin) of freshly isolated neutrophils, which was defined as 100%. Bax/Bcl-xLin Vitro Binding Studies—One μg of purified plasmids containing sequence verified cDNAs encoding Bax (pCRII) or Bcl-xL (pBSK-, kind gift of L. Boise) was in vitro transcribed and translated in the presence of l-[35S]methionine using a coupled transcription/translation TnT kit (Promega, Catalys AG, Wallisellen, Switzerland) according to instructions from the manufacturer. 35S-Labeled truncated Bax was prepared by in vitro digestion of 35S-labeled Bax with purified calpain-1 (Calbiochem) in assay buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm CaCl2) at 37 °C for 5 h. The reaction was stopped by adding E64-d (50 μm). Potential residual full-length Bax was immunodepleted by adding 10 μl of anti-Bax antisera (N20, Santa Cruz) at 4 °C for 2 h (15Wood D.E. Thomas A. Devi L.A. Berman Y. Beavis R.C. Reed J.C. Newcomb E.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1069-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), followed by incubation with 25 μl of protein A/G plus-agarose (Santa Cruz). The supernatant was subjected to two further cycles of immunodepletion and finally saved as 35S-labeled truncated Bax. 35S-Labeled Bax intended for co-immunoprecipitation experiments was treated in exactly the same way except that addition of purified calpain-1 and antisera (N20) was omitted. Ten μl of full-length or truncated Bax was incubated with 4 μl of translated Bcl-xL in 100 μl of buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 142.5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 2 h. One hundred μl of buffer containing 2 μg of polyclonal Bax antisera (BD Biosciences, Pharmingen) was added at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by an additional 2-h incubation with 25 μl of protein A/G plus-agarose (Santa Cruz) at 4 °C. After three washing steps with buffer and two PBS washing steps, the bound proteins were eluted by adding loading buffer and heated at 80 °C for 10 min. An aliquot of the obtained protein solution was loaded on 12% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen), followed by autoradiography. Subcellular Fractionation—Freshly purified neutrophils and neutrophils cultured in the presence or absence of E64-d (50 μm) and CH11 antibody for 8 h, were washed with cold PBS and digitonin-permeabilized essentially as described elsewhere (20Adrain C. Creagh E.M. Martin S.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6627-6636Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Equal volumes of the NuPAGE loading buffer-supplemented fractions were loaded on 12% NuPAGE gels and subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Filters were incubated with anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (1/500; BD Biosciences, Pharmingen) or anti-Smac polyclonal antisera (1/500; Alexis), and binding was detected by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL. Stripped filters were incubated with anti-voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) monoclonal antibody (1/500; Calbiochem). Enzymatic Caspase Assay—Neutrophils were cultured in the presence or absence of E64-d (50 μm), CH11 antibody, and Smac peptide (50 μm) for 10 h, washed with cold PBS, and subsequently lysed in cell lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% Chaps, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA) using a Teflon glass homogenizer (VWR International, Ismaning, Germany) on ice for 10 min. After a 10-min centrifugation step at 10,000 × g at 4 °C, caspase-3-like activity was measured in 10 μl of supernatants as enzymatic conversion of the colorimetric substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA at 405 nm according to the instructions from the manufacturer (QuantiZyme caspase-3 cellular activity assay kit; Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA). For controls, we also analyzed caspase-3-like activity of recombinant caspase-3 (Calbiochem) in the presence and absence of the indicated concentrations of E64-d and 50 μm Ac-DEVD. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—Cytospins were made from freshly purified neutrophils and neutrophils cultured in the presence or absence of E64-d (50 μm) and CH11 antibody for 12 h. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min and washed four times in PBS, pH 7.4. Permeabilization of cells was performed with 0.05% saponin in blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin in PBS) at room temperature for 5 min and with acetone at -20 °C for 15 min. To prevent nonspecific binding, slides were incubated in blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 h. Indirect immunostainings for cytochrome c, Smac, and VDAC were performed at room temperature for 1 h by using the following primary antibodies: anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (1/100; diluted in blocking buffer), anti-Smac polyclonal antisera (1/100), and anti-VDAC monoclonal antibody (1/200). Incubation with appropriate TRITC- and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Milan Analytica, La Roche, Switzerland) was performed in the dark at room temperature for 1 h. The anti-fading agent Slowfade (Molecular Probes) was added, and the cells were covered by coverslips. The slides were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss, Heidelberg, Germany) equipped with argon and helium-neon lasers. Molecular Protein Modeling—The models were based on the NMR structure of Bax (Protein Data Bank code 1F16) (32Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). The NH2-deleted Bax was built by simply removing the first 32 amino acids from the three-dimensional structure of the conformer number 1. All calculations were carried out with the AMBER 6 program (33Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.W. Cheatham T.E. Ross III, W.S. Simmerling C.L. Darden T.A. Merz K.M. Stanton R.V. Cheng A.L.

Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (30918) Google Scholar) were used for the proteins and the water molecules, respectively. The dielectric constant was set equal to 1. Long range electrostatic interactions were estimated by means of the particle mesh Ewald method (36Darden T.A. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (21714) Google Scholar), whereas the short range electrostatic and van der Waals interactions were truncated within a 12-Å cut-off. Constant temperature pressure was achieved by coupling the system with a Berendsen thermostat (T = 300 K; coupling constant = 1.0 ps) and barostat (P = 1 atm; coupling constant = 1.0 ps) (37Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. van Gunsteren W.F. DiNola A. Haak J.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (24191) Google Scholar). Full-length and truncated Bax were immersed in a 69 × 58 × 51-Å3 box containing ∼6000 water molecules, to account for the effects of the explicit solvent. The positions of the water molecules were equilibrated by running 5000 geometry optimization steps and 30-ps molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The two systems were further studied by carrying out 2-ns MD simulations. Because a stable conformation was not achieved even after 2 ns of MD simulations, the NH2-deleted model was simulated up to 3.2 ns. Spontaneous and Fas Receptor-mediated Neutrophil Apoptosis Require Calpain-1 but Not Calpain-2—To determine whether calpain has a functional role within apoptotic pathways in neutrophils, we used the previously characterized pan-calpain inhibitor E64-d (14Squier M.K.T. Cohen J.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3690-3697PubMed Google Scholar, 38Mehdi S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 150-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) in an in vitro system of neutrophil apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 1A, E64-d delayed spontaneous and Fas receptor (CH11)-mediated neutrophil death in a dose-dependent manner. The data represent cell death numbers of 24-h cultures, but the effect of E64-d was also observed in 12-, 36-, and 48-h cultures (data not shown). E64-d also inhibited phosphatidylserine redistribution (Fig. 1B), DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1C), and morphological changes associated with apoptosis (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the type of neutrophil death blocked by E64-d was apoptosis. Several lysosomal (ammonium chloride, chloroquine) and cathepsin inhibitors (compound 28 (Ref. 19Li Z. Ortega-Vilain A.C. Patil G.S. Chu D.L. Foreman J.E. Eveleth D.D. Powers J.C. J. Med.

To confirm the potential role of calpain in the regulation of neutrophil apoptosis, we applied cell-permeable inhibitors that block specific calpain isoforms. Whereas a specific calpain-1 inhibitor (19Li Z. Ortega-Vilain A.C. Patil G.S. Chu D.L. Fo"
https://openalex.org/W2072014938,"To explore the molecular basis of von Willebrand factor (VWF) clearance, an experimental model employing VWF-deficient mice was developed. Biodistribution was examined by the injection of radiolabeled VWF, which was primarily directed to the liver with minor amounts in other organs. Disappearance of VWF from plasma was characterized by a rapid initial phase (t½α = 13 min) and a slow secondary phase (t½β = 3 h), with a mean residence time (MRT) of 2.8 h. A similar clearance was observed for VWF consisting of only high or low molecular weight multimers, indicating that, in our experimental model, clearance is independent of multimeric distribution. This allowed us to compare the survival of full-length VWF to truncated variants. Deletion of both the amino-terminal D′-D3 and carboxyl-terminal D4-CK domains resulted in a fragment with a similar clearance to wild-type VWF. Deletion of only the D′-D3 region was associated with an almost 2-fold lower recovery and increased clearance (MRT = 1.6 h), whereas deletion of only the D4-CK region resulted in a significantly reduced clearance (MRT = 4.5 h, p < 0.02). These results point to a role of the D′-D3 region in preventing clearance of VWF. Furthermore, replacement of D3 domain residue Arg-1205 by His resulted in a markedly increased clearance (MRT = 0.3 h; p = 0.004). Therefore, this mutation seems to abrogate the protective effect of the D′-D3 region. In vitro analysis of this mutant also revealed a 2-fold reduced affinity for VWF propeptide at low pH, showing that mutation of Arg-1205 results not only in an increased clearance rate but is also associated with an impaired pH-dependent interaction with VWF propeptide.

The absence of functional VWF is associated with an abnormal bleeding tendency known as von Willebrand Disease (VWD) (1Budde U. Schneppenheim R. Rev. Clin. Exp.

VWF contributes to hemostasis in a dual manner. First, it promotes the adhesion of platelets at sites of vascular injury by acting as a molecular bridge between the sub-endothelial collagen matrix and the platelet-surface receptor complex glycoprotein (Gp) Ibα/IX/V (3Ruggeri Z.M. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In addition, VWF serves as a carrier protein for coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) in the circulation. This chaperone function results in stabilization of the FVIII heterodimeric structure (4Weiss H.J. Sussman I.I. Hoyer L.W. J. Clin.

Blood. 2000; 95: 1703-1708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VWF is produced and stored in endothelial cells and megakaryocytes. It is synthesized as pre-pro-VWF, a single chain polypeptide with the domain structure D1-D2-D′-D3-A1-A2-A3-D4-B1-B2-B3-C1-C2-CK (7Verweij C.L. Diergaarde P.J. Hart M. Pannekoek H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The pro-VWF molecule is subject to extensive posttranslational modifications, including carboxyl-terminal dimerization (8Vischer U.M. Wagner D.D. Blood. 1994; 83: 3536-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of proteolytic processing, pro-VWF is further separated into two polypeptides, the VWF propeptide (also known as VWF AgII) containing the D1-D2 region, and mature VWF, which comprises the remaining domains. The main function of the propeptide is to facilitate amino-terminal multimerization of mature VWF within the post-Golgi compartments and its targeting to Weibel-Palade storage bodies in endothelial cells (9Wagner D.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 217-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Haberichter S.L. Fahs S.A. Montgomery R.R. Blood. 2000; 96: 1808-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the propeptide and mature VWF appear to interact within cellular organelles, where conditions are slightly acidic (pH < 6.5). The extent of multimerization may differ between VWF molecules and is defined by the number of dimeric subunits included (between 2 and >20). As a result, VWF circulates within plasma as a heterogeneously sized protein with its molecular mass ranging from 0.5 × 106 to over 5 × 106 Da. The average plasma level of VWF is ∼10 μg/ml (35 nm based on monomer concentrations), although a broad range is observed between individuals (11Sadler J.E. Blood. 2003; 101: 2089-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). A major part of this variation is determined by ABO blood type; the average VWF levels in persons with blood group O are ∼25% lower than those in non-O individuals (12Gill J.C. Endres-Brooks J. Bauer P.J. Marks Jr., W.J. Montgomery R.R. Blood. 1987; 69: 1691-1695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, other genetic (13Orstavik K.H. Folia Haematol. (Leipz.). 1990; 117: 527-531Google Scholar, 14Carlos S.J. Almasy L. Manuel S.J. Buil A. Stone W. Lathrop M. Blangero J. Fontcuberta J. Thromb.

Fibrinolysis. 2001; 12: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), may also contribute to this variation. These factors may influence VWF levels by modulating the balance between its biosynthesis and clearance. In the last two decades, biosynthesis of VWF has been well studied (for recent reviews see Refs. 17Denis C.V. Int. J. Hematol. 2002; 75: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar and 18de Wit T.R. van Mourik J.A. Best Pract. Res. Clin. Haematol. 2001; 14: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, little is known about the mechanism by which VWF is cleared from the circulation. However, this issue is becoming increasingly important, as illustrated by several recent reports suggesting that modified clearance plays a role in the pathogenesis of VWD type 1 (19Casonato A. Pontara E. Sartorello F. Cattini M.G. Sartori M.T. Padrini R. Girolami A. Blood. 2002; 99: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 20Brown S.A. Eldridge A. Collins P.W. Bowen D.J. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 1714-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). One of the very few parameters that has been reported to date to influence VWF clearance is the VWF glycosylation profile (12Gill J.C. Endres-Brooks J. Bauer P.J. Marks Jr., W.J. Montgomery R.R. Blood. 1987; 69: 1691-1695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21O'Donnell J. Laffan M.A. Transfus. Med. 2001; 11: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 22Stoddart Jr., J.H. Andersen J.

Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10042-10047Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). For instance, by using an animal model it has been shown that, in the absence of the enzyme ST3Gal-IV, the half-life of endogenous VWF is reduced 2-fold (24Ellies L.G. Ditto D. Levy G.G. Wahrenbrock M. Ginsburg D. Varki A. Le D.T. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10042-10047Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Moreover, in a patient group referred to the hospital for real or suspected bleeding disorder, reduced ST3Gal-IV-mediated sialylation was observed to be associated with reduced VWF plasma levels (24Ellies L.G. Ditto D. Levy G.G. Wahrenbrock M. Ginsburg D. Varki A. Le D.T. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10042-10047Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that carbohydrate components play a role in the clearance of VWF. In addition to the carbohydrate side chains, polypeptide regions are also likely to contribute to the interaction with clearance receptors. However, no such region has yet been identified within the VWF molecule. Thus, the molecular basis of VWF clearance is still an unexplored issue in view of the responsible receptors as well as in view of the regions within VWF that mediate binding to these receptors. To gain more insight into the molecular aspects of VWF clearance, an experimental model was developed employing mice genetically deficient for VWF. Using this model, the in vivo survival of truncated as well as mutated variants of VWF was compared with that of full-length VWF. These experiments indicate that the D′-D3 region of VWF and, in particular, the D3-domain residue Arg-1205 contribute to the clearance process of VWF. Mice—The VWF-deficient mice (25Denis C. Methia N. Frenette P.S. Rayburn H. Ullman-Cullere M. Hynes R.O. Wagner D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9524-9529Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) and wild-type mice used in this study were on a C57BL/6J background and were used between 8 and 12 weeks of age. Housing and experiments were done as recommended by French regulations and the experimental guidelines of the European Community. Proteins—For biodistribution experiments, a highly purified, plasma-derived (pd) human VWF concentrate (a kind gift of Dr. C. Mazurier, LFB, Lille, France) was labeled with Na125I (Amersham Biosciences) using the IODO-GEN method (Pierce). Routinely, this method resulted in preparations containing 2–4 × 105 cpm/μg VWF. Free iodine in final preparations was <5% as determined by precipitation with 20% trichloroacetic acid. VWF preparations enriched in either high or low molecular weight multimers were obtained by fractionating an intermediate pure VWF concentrate (Hemate-P, Behring, Marburg, Germany) by gel filtration chromatography using Bio-Gel A-15m (Bio-Rad). The factor VIII light chain was kindly provided by Dr. K. Mertens (Sanquin Research, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Recombinant GpIbα (residues 1–290) was expressed and purified as described (26Huizinga E.G. Tsuji S. Romijn R.A. Schiphorst M.E. De Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Gros P. Science. 2002; 297: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant VWF propeptide was a generous gift of Dr. H. C. Raaijmakers (Utrecht University, The Netherlands). Human placenta collagen type III (catalog number C-4407) and bovine albumin (fraction V) were purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal antibodies against VWF and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal antibodies against VWF were obtained from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark). Recombinant VWF—Expression-vectors pNUT-VWF and pNUT-VWF/D2509G have been described previously (27Sixma J.J. Schiphorst M.E. Verweij C.L. Pannekoek H. Eur. J.

Blood. 1995; 86: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pNUT-VWF/R1205H was constructed by introducing the R1205H mutation in a 1-kb human VWF cDNA fragment using the QuikChange method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and specific primers (Proligo, Paris, France) as follows: strand, 5′-GTGGCTGGCCGGCATTTTGCCTCAG-3′; antistrand, 5′-CTGAGGCAAAATGCCGGCCAGCCAC-3′ (the mutated nucleotide is underlined). After sequence analysis, this fragment was subcloned into the pNUT-VWF vector containing full-length VWF cDNA. pNUT-VWF/D′-A3 encoding residues 1–1874 was constructed by generating a PCR fragment with the forward primer 5′-GTTTCCCAGCTAGCTATTTTG-3′, containing the unique NheI restriction site (underlined) at position 5110 in pNUT-VWF, and the reverse primer 5′-GCCCGGGCTCCAGAGCACAGTTTGTGGAGGAAGG-3′, containing a SfrI restriction site (underlined). The PCR fragment was ligated into pCR2.1-TOPO. After sequence analysis, the NheI-SfrI fragment was ligated into the NheI-EcoRV-digested pNUT-His. In this modified pNUT-VWF cassette vector, an extra oligonucleotide sequence (5′-ATCACCATCACCATCACTAGATCT-3′ that encodes a His tag and a stop codon) is inserted into the unique EcoRV restriction site. pNUT-VWF/D′-D3, encoding VWF residues 1–1247, was constructed by generating a PCR fragment with the forward primer 5′-CCTGGGACCTTTCGGATCCTAGTGG-3′, containing the unique BamHI restriction site (underlined) at position 2717 in pNUT-VWF, and the reverse primer 5′-GCCCGGGCGGGAGGCACCACCAGGCCTCC-3′, containing an SrfI restriction site (underlined). The PCR fragment was ligated into pCR2.1-TOPO. After sequence analysis, the BamHI-SfrI fragment was ligated into BamHI-EcoRV-digested pNUT-His. pNUT-VWF/A1-A3 encodes the VWF A1-A2-A3 domain region (residues 1260–1874) containing an amino-terminal His tag and was generously provided by Dr. S. Tsuji (University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands). pNUT-VWF/A1-CK, encoding residues 1260–2813, was constructed by subcloning a NheI-EcoRI fragment from pNUT-VWF into pNUT-VWF/A1-A3. Purification of Recombinant VWF—All recombinant VWF variants were expressed in baby hamster kidney cells that also overexpress furin for proper removal of the VWF propeptide (29Lankhof H. van Hoeij M. Schiphorst M.E. Bracke M. Wu Y.P. Ijsseldijk M.J. Vink T. De Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Thromb. Haemost. 1996; 75: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). wt-VWF, VWF/R1205H, and VWF/D2509G were purified from conditioned serum-free medium (Ultroser G from Biosepra, Cergy-Saint Christophe, France) by immunoaffinity chromatography employing the antibody RU-8 as described (30Lankhof H. Damas C. Schiphorst M.E. Ijsseldijk M.J. Bracke M. Furlan M. De Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Vink T. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 81: 976-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The truncated variants VWF/A1-A3, VWF/D′-D3, VWF/D′-A3, and VWF/A1-CK were purified from conditioned serum-free medium by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography as instructed by the manufacturer (Qiagen). VWF/D′-A3, VWF/D′-D3, and VWF/A1-CK were further purified by anion-ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. Purified proteins were dialyzed against 125 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and stored in small aliquots at –20 °C. Analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that all preparations were purified to homogeneity. The multimeric structure of VWF was analyzed by 0.1% SDS, 1% agarose gel electrophoresis employing previously described methods (31Obert B. Houllier A. Meyer D. Girma J.P. Blood. 1999; 93: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Romijn R.A. Westein E. Bouma B. Schiphorst M.E. Sixma J.J. Lenting P.J. Huizinga E.G. J. Biol.

Biodistribution of VWF—VWF deficient or wild-type mice were injected intravenously with radiolabeled pd-VWF (5 μg/mouse, corresponding to 1–2 × 106 cpm/mouse) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% albumin. At different time points (3, 15, and 30 min and 1, 2, and 4 h after injection) mice were anesthetized with tribromoethanol (0.15 ml per 10 g of body weight) and bled by retro-orbital venous plexus puncture. Subsequently, the mice were sacrificed, and various organs (heart, lungs, liver, spleen, stomach, kidneys and left upper leg) were collected, which were analyzed for the presence of radioactivity. Three mice were used per time point. Clearance of VWF in Mice—VWF-deficient mice were injected intravenously with wt-VWF or variants thereof (5 μg/mouse) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine albumin. At different time points (3 and 30 min and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h after injection), mice were anesthetized with tribromoethanol (0.15 ml per 10 g of body weight), blood was collected by eye bleed, and plasma was prepared as described (33Denis C.V. Kwack K. Saffaripour S. Maganti S. Andre P. Schaub R.G. Wagner D.D. Blood. 2001; 97: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Three to six mice were used for each time point, and each mouse was bled only once. VWF antigen levels were quantified in a previously described immunosorbent assay using polyclonal antibodies (32Romijn R.A. Westein E. Bouma B. Schiphorst M.E. Sixma J.J. Lenting P.J. Huizinga E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15035-15039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Normal pooled plasma from 40 healthy donors was used as a reference, assuming that 1 ml of pooled plasma contains 10 μg of VWF (35 nm, based on a monomeric molecular mass of 250 kDa). To quantify antigen values of VWF/D′-A3 and VWF/D′-D3, polyclonal rabbit antibodies directed against the D′-D3 region were used as capturing antibodies. In addition, a purified preparation of VWF/D′-A3 was used as a reference. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding assays were performed employing a Biacore2000 system (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Collagen and GpIbα binding experiments were performed as described previously (26Huizinga E.G. Tsuji S. Romijn R.A. Schiphorst M.E. De Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Gros P. Science. 2002; 297: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 32Romijn R.A. Westein E. Bouma B. Schiphorst M.E. Sixma J.J. Lenting P.J. Huizinga E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15035-15039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For FVIII light chain and VWF propeptide binding experiments, wt-VWF, VWF/R1205H, and VWF/A1-CK were immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip using the amine-coupling kit as instructed by the supplier (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). VWF/A1-CK was used as a control, as it lacks the interactive sites for the FVIII light chain and propeptide. Binding to wt-VWF and VWF/R1205H-coated channels was corrected for binding to the VWF/A1-CK-coated control channel. Binding to this control channel was <5% of binding to both other channels. Binding of the FVIII light chain to immobilized VWF was performed in 125 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes (pH7.4) at 25 °C with a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Regeneration of the surface was performed by subsequent application of the same buffer containing 1 m CaCl2. The interaction between the propeptide and VWF was analyzed employing various buffers such as 125 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4 or 6.5) or 125 mm NaCl, 25 mm (CH3)2AsO2Na (pH 5.8 or 5.2) at 25 °C with a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Regeneration of the surface was performed by subsequent application of 10 mm taurodeoxycholate, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9). At least two distinct chips were used for each pH to assess binding. Before and after experiments at pH 6.5, 5.8, and 5.2, the binding of propeptide to immobilized VWF was also examined at pH 7.4 to establish the integrity of the VWF surface. The system was primed each time the flow buffer was changed. Data Analysis and Statistics—Analysis of pharmacokinetic and SPR data was performed using the GraphPad Prism program (GraphPad Prism version 4.0 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Data obtained from SPR analysis were used for the calculation of the affinity constants (KD) as follows. Responses at equilibrium (Req) derived from sensorgrams were plotted against protein concentration. The resulting binding isotherms were subsequently fitted to the equation Req = Req,max × [protein]/(KD + [protein]) to obtain KD. Clearance data were fitted to the biexponential equation Cp = Ae–αt + Be–βt to obtain A, α, B, and β. Cp refers to the amount of residual VWF antigen in plasma relative to the amount injected. These parameters were used to calculate mean residence time (MRT) employing the equation MRT = (A/α2 + B/β2)/(A/α + B/β). Furthermore, α and β were used to calculate half-lives of the initial and terminal phase, respectively, employing t½α = ln 2/α and t½β = ln 2/β. Statistical analyses were performed by the Student's unpaired t test using the GraphPad InStat program (GraphPad InStat version 3.0 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). VWF Is Predominantly Targeted to the Liver—To gain more insight into the clearance process of VWF, we first investigated the biodistribution of this protein by injecting radiolabeled pd-VWF (∼2 × 106 cpm/mouse) in VWF-deficient mice. Mice were sacrificed after intravenous tail injection (time points 3, 15, or 30 min and 1, 2, or 4 h). Subsequently, organs were collected and analyzed for the presence of radioactivity. At the initial time points, minor amounts of radioactivity (between 0.4 and 2% of the amount injected) were detected in heart, lungs, stomach, spleen, kidneys, and left upper leg (Fig. 1A). These amounts remained below 2.5% up until 4 h after injection, except that some radioactivity (up to 10%) started to accumulate in the stomach between 1 and 2 h after injection. In contrast, within 3 min after injection 9 ± 0.9% of the amount injected appeared to be present in the liver. This amount increased to 17 ± 2% at 15 min after injection, followed by a gradual decline to 8 ± 0.4% between 0.5 and 4 h. A similar organ distribution was observed in wild-type mice (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that intravenously administered VWF is primarily targeted to the liver. Biphasic Clearance of Recombinant wt-VWF—To investigate the removal of VWF from plasma, VWF-deficient mice were injected intravenously with recombinant wt-VWF. At indicated time points after injection, mice were bled and plasma was analyzed for VWF antigen. The recovery appeared to be 79 ± 14% in samples obtained 3 min after injection (Table I). Graphic representation of the antigen values revealed that the protein disappeared from plasma in a biphasic manner, characterized by a rapid initial phase and a slow secondary phase (Fig. 2). Pharmacokinetic analysis allowed the calculation of the apparent half-lives, which were 12.6 ± 0.9 min and 3.0 ± 0.9 h for the rapid and slow phase, respectively. Furthermore, MRT was calculated to be 2.8 ± 0.7 h (Table I).Table IPharmacokinetic parameters describing the clearance of VWF and its variants from plasmaRecoveryMRTt½αt½β% of injectedhminhwt-VWF79 ± 142.8 ± 0.712.6 ± 0.93.0 ± 0.9LMW-VWF70 ± 112.3 ± 0.715.2 ± 1.91.9 ± 0.4(p > 0.05)(p > 0.05)(p > 0.05)(p > 0.05)HMW-VWF72 ± 63.0 ± 1.414.1 ± 1.92.6 ± 1.1(p > 0.05)(p > 0.05)(p > 0.05)(p > 0.05)VWF/A1-A362 ± 82.9 ± 0.616.2 ± 4.22.8 ± 0.6(p > 0.05)(p > 0.05)(p > 0.05)(p > 0.05)VWF/A1-CK43 ± 141.6 ± 0.18.0 ± 0.51.5 ± 0.3(p = 0.0102)(p = 0.0479)(p = 0.0015)(p > 0.05)VWF/D′-A370 ± 124.5 ± 0.219.8 ± 2.94.5 ± 0.1(p > 0.05)(p = 0.0179)(p = 0.0148)(p > 0.05)VWF/D′-D375 ± 35.9 ± 1.423.4 ± 6.76.5 ± 0.5(p > 0.05)(p = 0.0265)(p = 0.035)(p = 0.0049)VWF/R1205H97 ± 80.3 ± 0.017.6 ± 0.20.3 ± 0.03(p > 0.05)(p = 0.0042)(p = 0.0007)(p = 0.0069)VWF/D2509G82 ± 52.3 ± 0.512.0 ± 2.22.2 ± 0.2(p > 0.05)(p > 0.05)(p > 0.05)(p > 0.05) Open table in a new tab High and Low Molecular Weight Multimeric VWF Display Similar Survival in Mice—Preparations containing multimerized VWF are heterogeneous, as the number of included subunits may vary between molecules (from 2 to >20). To address whether the clearance of VWF depends on its extent of multimerization, we assessed the survival of pd-VWF fractions enriched in either high (predominantly 14-mers and higher) or low (predominantly dimers and tetramers) molecular weight multimers (see inset, Fig. 3) using VWF-deficient mice. These experiments revealed that both VWF preparations were cleared from plasma in a similar manner (Fig. 3). Indeed, similar pharmacokinetic parameters could be calculated from the experimental data (Table I). Moreover, the clearance of both high and low molecular weight multimers was similar to that of recombinant wt-VWF. The possibility was considered that the clearance of larger multimers was similar to that of smaller multimers, because these large multimers were converted into smaller forms before removal from circulation. However, analysis of the plasma samples demonstrated that the large multimeric forms were not converted into smaller fragments before disappearance from the plasma (data not shown). Thus, the rate of VWF clearance is independent of its multimeric size in our experimental model. Opposite Effects of Amino- and Carboxyl-terminal Truncations on the Plasma Survival of VWF—In view of the complex protein structure of VWF, it was of further interest to study the contribution of the various regions of the VWF molecule to its clearance. To this end, a number of recombinant VWF variants with amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal truncations were constructed (Fig. 4A). Purified proteins were administered to VWF-deficient mice by tail vein injection. With regard to a fragment consisting of the A1-A2-A3 domains selectively (i.e. VWF/A1-A3), a clearance pattern similar to wt-VWF was observed (Fig. 4B). As summarized in Table I, similar pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained for this variant and wt-VWF. In contrast, a variant with an amino-terminal truncation (designated VWF/A1-CK) displayed an initial recovery that was significantly lower than that observed for wt-VWF (43 ± 16% versus 79 ± 14% (p = 0.01) for VWF/A1-CK and wt-VWF, respectively). In addition, VWF/A1-CK was cleared from plasma in the initial phase more rapidly than wt-VWF (Fig. 4B). Indeed, both t½α and MRT were significantly reduced for the truncated protein compared with wt-VWF (Table I). For the variants with a deletion of the carboxyl-terminal part of the protein, designated VWF/D′-A3 and VWF/D′-D3, the initial recovery was indistinguishable from that of wt-VWF. However, in the rapid phase of the clearance, both variants disappeared slower from plasma than wt-VWF (Fig. 4B). For instance, 13 ± 1% residual wt-VWF remained in plasma 1 h after injection, whereas almost 2-fold more antigen could be detected for VWF/D′-A3 (21 ± 1.6%; p = 0.0018) and VWF/D′-D3 (22.2 ± 1.3%; p = 0.0006). Calculation of the pharmacokinetic parameters revealed that both t½α and MRT were prolonged for the truncated proteins (Table I). Taken together, these data suggest the following. (i) Multiple areas may be involved in the direct interaction with components that mediate the removal of VWF from the circulation; and (ii) particular regions within the VWF molecule may play a regulatory role in its survival. One example hereof might be the D′-D3 region, which seems to protect VWF from premature clearance. Replacement of Arg-1205 by His Results in an Increased Clearance Rate—The observation that the D′-D3 domain appears to be involved in the clearance of VWF may be of relevance with regard to VWF mutants with amino acid replacements in this region as found in a number of patients suffering from type 1 VWD. For instance, mutation of the D3-domain residue Arg-1205 to His has been suggested to modulate the survival of VWF in patients (19Casonato A. Pontara E. Sartorello F. Cattini M.G. Sartori M.T. Padrini R. Girolami A. Blood. 2002; 99: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To study the direct contribution of Arg-1205 to the clearance of VWF, recombinant VWF/R1205H was expressed in baby hamster kidney-furin cells. Analysis of the conditioned medium revealed a normal pattern of multimerization for this mutant (Fig. 5A). However, when the purified protein was injected intravenously in VWF-deficient mice, VWF/R1205H disappeared remarkably rapidly from the circulation (Fig. 5B).

Here, we report that CP-31398 induces p53 reporter gene activity and p21 expression in all of 11 glioma cell lines harboring wild-type or mutant p53, but not in p53-null LN-308 cells. Upon prolonged exposure to CP-31398, all glioma cell lines undergo caspase-independent and bcl-x(L)-insensitive cell death with EC(50) concentrations of 10-36 microM. By comparing p53 wild-type U87MG and p53-null LN-308 cells expressing the temperature-sensitive p53(V135A) mutant, we delineate two pathways of CP-31398-induced cell death: an early, p53-dependent pathway that requires (new p53) protein synthesis and a late, p53-independent pathway characterized by aurintricarboxylic acid -sensitive calcium release and epiphenomenal free radical formation. Post-transcriptional repression of p53 synthesis by an intracellularly transcribed short interfering RNA confirmed the presence of these two pathways of cell death. These observations point out some of the liabilities of CP-31398 as a prototype p53-based therapeutic and define a rationale for further refinement of small molecules that specifically target the p53 pathway, but lack the p53-independent effects."

Activated microglia are found to be intimately associated with senile plaques and may play a central role in mediating chronic inflammatory conditions in Alzheimer's disease. Activation of cultured murine microglial BV2 cells by freshly sonicated Aβ42 results in the secretion of neurotoxic factors that kill primary cultured neurons. To understand molecular pathways underlying Aβ-induced microglial activation, we analyzed the expression levels of transcripts isolated from Aβ42-activated BV2 cells using high density filter arrays. The analysis of these arrays identified 554 genes that are transcriptionally up-regulated by Aβ42 in a statistically significant manner. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was used to confirm the regulation of a subset of genes, including cysteine proteases cathepsin B and cathepsin L, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 2, cytochrome c oxidase, and allograft inflammatory factor 1. Small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of the cathepsin B gene in Aβ-activated BV2 cells diminished the microglial activation-mediated neurotoxicity. Moreover, CA-074, a specific cathepsin B inhibitor, also abolished the neurotoxic effects caused by Aβ42-activated BV2 cells. Our results suggest an essential role for secreted cathepsin B in neuronal death mediated by Aβ-activated inflammatory response.

Science. 2002; 298: 789-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3438) Google Scholar). The main pathological hallmarks include senile amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, dystrophic neurites, significant neuronal loss in selected regions of the brain, and a chronic inflammatory response characterized by activated microglia, reactive astrocytes, complement factors, and increased expression of inflammatory cytokines (2Braak H.

Microglia, the resident macrophages in the brain, play a central role in mediating chronic inflammatory conditions in AD. They are closely associated with amyloid plaques and exhibit a reactive phenotype with elevated expression of cell surface markers, including CD45, Mac1, and major histocompatibility complex class II antigens (11Miyazono M. Iwaki T. Kitamoto T. Kaneko Y. Doh-ura K. Tateishi J. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 139: 589-598PubMed Google Scholar). They are also capable of releasing numerous acute phase proteins, such as α-antichymotrypsin, α-antitrypsin, complement proteins, and proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins 1α, 1β, and 6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and others (12Klegeris A.

There is compelling evidence that Aβ peptides serve as inflammatory stimuli to provoke a microglial-mediated inflammatory response that contributes significantly to neuronal loss and cognitive decline (3Akiyama H. et al.Neurobiol. Aging. 2000; 21: 383-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (3733) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have shown that stimulation of microglia by high concentration of fibrillar Aβ results in TNF-α-dependent expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and neuronal apoptosis (16McDonald D.R. Brunden K.R. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2284-2294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Combs C.K. Karlo J.C. Kao S.C. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1179-1188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that Aβ can amplify microglial activation by other coexisting inflammatory stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interferon γ (IFNγ), and advanced glycation end products (18Gasic-Milenkovic J. Dukic-Stefanovic S. Deuther-Conrad W. Gartner U. Munch G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Besides fibrillar Aβ42, soluble Aβ42 also appeared to be a potent activator of microglia. Purified dimeric and trimeric components of Aβ42 peptides from neuritic and vascular amyloid deposits elicit a profound neurotoxicity in hippocampal neurons in the presence of microglia (19Roher A.E. Chaney M.O. Kuo Y.M. Webster S.D. Stine W.B. Haverkamp L.J. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Tuohy J.M. Krafft G.A. Bonnell B.S. Emmerling M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20631-20635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). In addition, although the identity of the neurotoxic agent(s) has not been determined, studies indicate that activation of cultured microglia by senile/neuritic plaque fragments leads to the release of toxic factors that kill cultured hippocampal neurons (20Giulian D. Haverkamp L.J. Yu J.H. Karshin W. Tom D. Li J. Kirkpatrick J. Kuo L.M. Roher A.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6021-6037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Giulian D. Haverkamp L.J. Li J. Karshin W.L. Yu J. Tom D. Li X. Kirkpatrick J.B. Neurochem Int. 1995; 27: 119-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Therefore, identification of molecular targets involved in the initiation and maintenance of microglial activation caused by Aβ42 peptides may lead to a better understanding of inflammatory processes leading to AD. In this study, we investigated molecular mechanisms underlying the Aβ42-mediated inflammatory response in microglial cells using large scale profiling of transcriptional induction by Aβ42 peptides in murine microglial BV2 cells. Cathepsin B was identified to be one of the 554 genes transcriptionally induced by Aβ42. Specific inhibition of cathepsin B in BV2 cells using either small interference RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing or a specific cathepsin B inhibitor leads to diminished toxic effects on primary neurons. Our studies indicate that cathepsin B is a key player in microglial-mediated neuronal death. In addition, by combining large scale array analyses with siRNA-mediated gene silencing, our approach provides a useful platform to systematically probe molecular pathways involved in inflammation-mediated neuronal degeneration in AD. Aβ Preparation and Treatment of BV2 Cells with Aβ Peptides— Freshly sonicated Aβ42 was prepared by adding 1 ml of DMEM/F12/N2 medium to 1 mg of Aβ42 lyophilized powder (California Peptide, Napa, CA) and sonicating for 5 min. The resulting Aβ42 solution was then diluted with DMEM/F12/N2 to a final concentration of 5 or 11 μm and added to the BV2 cells for 15-16 h. Aged Aβ was prepared using a modified protocol from Dr. LaDu's laboratory (24Dahlgren K.N. Manelli A.M. Stine Jr., W.B. Baker L.K. Krafft G.A. LaDu M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32046-32053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). Briefly, Aβ42 powder lyophilized with hydroxyfluroisopropanol (California Peptide, Napa, CA) was dissolved in Me2SO and resuspended in DMEM/F12 at 44 μm before each use. The resulting solution was aged for 48 h at 4 °C. On the day of the treatment, the Aβ42 solution was diluted with DMEM/F12/N2 to a final concentration of 22 μm and added to the BV2 cells for 15-16 h. RNA Preparation and Library Construction—Total RNA from cells was isolated using Tri Star reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The resulting RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 40 min at 37 °C. Isolation of mRNA was carried out using Oligotex (Qiagen). To ensure the quality of mRNA preparations, denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis was used to assess the integrity and purity of each preparation. To decrease the redundancy and increase the relative abundance of rare transcripts, subtractive and normalized libraries were made. Reverse transcription and second strand synthesis were performed using the Superscript II reverse transcription kit (Invitrogen) with an anchored oligo(dT) (30Yankner B.A. Duffy L.K. Kirschner D.A. Science. 1990; 250: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar) primer. Subtractive and normalized cDNA libraries were generated using suppression PCR as described previously (26Diatchenko L. Lau Y.F. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6025-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). Array Production, Probe Generation, and Hybridization—Subtracted and normalized cDNA libraries were cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and plated. Single colonies were picked into 384-well plates using an automated colony picker (Q-Pix, Genetix, Cambridge, UK) to grow overnight to serve as templates for PCR. PCR products were spotted on Nylon membranes using a 384-pin head arrayer (Q-bot, Genetix, Cambridge, UK). More than 50,000 individual clones along with standards and empty wells were spotted onto three filters in each array. The probes were generated from three independent BV2 cultures treated with freshly sonicated Aβ42 peptide (California Peptide) along with controls. Briefly, mRNA was isolated from those cells as described previously. Double-stranded cDNA was generated by reverse transcription and second strand synthesis and digested with RsaI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The probes were generated through labeling with [33P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a Decamer labeling kit (Ambion). Hybridization was performed at 42 °C for 24 h in a hybridization solution containing 50% formamide. Array Analysis and Gene Annotation—A Cyclone phosphorimaging system (Packard Biosciences, Meriden, CT) and GenePix software analysis (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) were used to obtain densitometry of the 33P signal. After normalization with the global background calculated from 1100 empty array spots, the mean and standard deviation from triplicate measurements for each clone was determined to calculate the confidence level (Student's t test) and ratio of expression between control and Aβ-activated BV2 cells. Arrays experiments were performed twice with the same probes, and the clones confirmed to be up-regulated in either experiments were submitted for sequencing. Sequence analysis was performed using Phrap (CodonCode, Dedham, MA), and a comprehensive homology analysis was conducted using a Blast algorithm against the RefSeq (NCBI) data base on accelerated hardware (TimeLogic, Reno, NV). Gene classifications were generated by mapping nonredundant genes to gene ontology (GO) “molecular function” terms that are assigned and approved by a GO curator or inference from electronic annotation (27Ashburner M. et al.Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (27692) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection with siRNA—The BV2 immortalized murine microglial cell line was kindly provided by Dr. Virginia Bocchini and has been described previously (22Blasi E. Barluzzi R. Bocchini V. Mazzolla R. Bistoni F. J. Neuroimmunol. 1990; 27: 229-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Briefly, BV2 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were kept at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. To inhibit expression of cathepsin B, cathepsin L, TIMP2, and AIF1 in BV2 cells, the cells were transiently transfected with siRNAs (Dharmacon Research, Lafayette, CO) corresponding to part of their coding sequences. The corresponding sequences are aagaagctgtgtggcactgtc for cathepsin B, aagtccacgcacagaagactg for cathepsin L, aaggagtatctaattgcagga for TIMP2, and aacaagcaattcctcgatgat for AIF. The transient transfections with siRNAs were performed with LipofectAMINE Plus Reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (23Mitrasinovic O.M. Murphy Jr., G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29889-29896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Three hours after transfection, the cultures were washed once and incubated with DMEM/F12/N2 overnight. The next day, the cells were washed with DMEM/F12/N2 before being treated with 100 ng/ml of LPS and 100 ng/ml of IFNγ or 5-11 μm of sonicated Aβ42 for 15-16 h. The supernatants were collected to treat primary cortical neurons, and the cells were harvested for total RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR. Primary Cortical Culture and Neurotoxicity Assay—Primary cortical neurons were cultured in serum-free media. Briefly, embryonic day 16-18 rat cortices were dissected and digested using trypsin and DNase I. After dissociation with repetitive trituration, the cells were plated in Neurobasal medium supplemented with SATO (25Bottenstein J.E. Sato G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 514-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar) and B27 (Invitrogen). Three days after plating, half of the medium was removed, and fresh neurobasal medium with N2 was added with 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (Sigma) to inhibit rapidly dividing glial cells. To test the neurotoxic effects of factors secreted by activated BV2 cells, seven days after plating cortical neurons were treated with supernatants from BV2 cells, which were stimulated by LPS/IFNγ, freshly sonicated Aβ42, or aged Aβ42 for 15-16 h (see Fig. 2A). For the siRNA-mediated knock-down studies, BV2 cells were stimulated with freshly sonicated Aβ42 for 15-16 h 2 days after the transfection of siRNAs corresponding to sequences of cathepsin B, cathepsin L, TIMP2, and AIF1 genes. For the inhibitor study, BV2 cells were pretreated with 0.5 or 1 μm of CA-074 for half an hour before Aβ42 stimulation in the presence of 0.5 or 1 μm of CA-074. The resulting supernatants were added to primary neurons for 72 h to induce neuronal death. The amount of neuronal death was quantified with the CellTiter-Glo cell viability assay (Promega, WI) per the manufacturer's instructions in a microplate luminometer reader (LB 96V; EG&G Berthold, Germany). Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA isolation and cDNA generation was performed as described under “RNA Preparation and Library Construction.” SYBR Green real time PCR amplifications were performed in an Icycler Real-Time Detection System (Bio-Rad). The reactions were performed in duplicate in 25 μl of reaction volume with the following PCR conditions: 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 30 s, followed by 72 °C for 40 s. The primers were designed using Primer3 developed by the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research. The PCR primers used were TGAGGTAGACAGGGGAGTCTTT and GTGTTTGGAGGGTAGCTCTGAT for cathepsin B; TTGGGAACAGCCTTAGCTACTC and ATATCGCTCTCCTCCACTCTTC for cathepsin L; GGAGACGTTCAGCTACTCTGACT and ACCAGTTGGCCTCTTGTGTT for AIF1; GCACATTACCCTCTGTGACTTC and AGCGAGTGATCTTGCACTCA for TIMP2; and GACCATCAGCACCACTTCAC and GCTCTGTAGAGGAGGGCATTAG for cytochrome c. A standard curve was plotted for each primer set with the critical threshold cycle (Ct) values obtained from amplification of 10-fold dilutions of cDNA from whole brain to calculate the PCR efficiency of the primer set. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used an internal reference to normalize the target transcripts, and the relative differences were calculated using the PCR efficiencies according to Pfaffl (28Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25871) Google Scholar). Activation of BV2 Cells by Freshly Sonicated Aβ, Not Aged Aβ, Induced Neuronal Death—Numerous studies have described how microglial lineage cells secrete neurotoxic factors upon stimulation with synthetic Aβ peptides or Aβ isolated from human plaques. Most of the studies focused on stimulation of microglial lineage cells with fibrillar Aβ at very high concentrations or in combination with IFNγ (12Klegeris A. Walker D.G. McGeer P.L. Brain Res. 1997; 747: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 16McDonald D.R. Brunden K.R. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2284-2294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Combs C.K.

Neuroimmunol. 1996; 67: 21-29Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recent studies demonstrate that soluble Aβ peptides, including oligomers and amyloid-derived diffusible ligands, are also neurotoxic. We reasoned that soluble Aβ42 might play an important role in microglial-mediated neurodegeneration. In our in vitro system that mimics microglial-dependent neuronal death in AD, we compared neuronal damage in primary rat cortical neurons upon treatment with the conditioned medium from murine microglial BV2 cells stimulated with either freshly sonicated soluble Aβ42 or aged Aβ42 peptides. Consistent with prior studies, aged Aβ42 peptide alone caused significant direct neuronal death in primary cortical neurons (Refs. 30Yankner B.A. Duffy L.K. Kirschner D.A. Science. 1990; 250: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar, 31Whitson J.S. Selkoe D.J. Cotman C.W. Science. 1989; 243: 1488-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 32Pike C.J. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. Brain Res. 1991; 563: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). However, when aged Aβ42 peptide was incubated with BV2 cells, the conditioned medium caused no significant neurotoxicity. The loss of neurotoxicity is likely due to the removal of Aβ42 peptides from the conditioned medium after incubation with BV2 cells, probably through phagocytosis as well as proteolysis by secreted degrading enzymes (33Rogers J. Strohmeyer R. Kovelowski C.J. Li R. Glia. 2002; 40: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 34Kopec K.K. Carroll R.T. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2123-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 35Qiu W.Q. Walsh D.M. Ye Z. Vekrellis K. Zhang J. Podlisny M.B. Rosner M.R. Safavi A. Hersh L.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32730-32738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). In contrast, freshly sonicated Aβ42 peptide alone did not induce direct toxicity in primary cultured neurons (Fig. 1). However, when sonicated Aβ42 peptide was incubated with BV2 cells, the conditioned medium induced a profound neurotoxicity, suggesting the presence of neuron-damaging factors in the BV2 conditioned medium (Fig. 1). Not surprisingly, LPS and IFNγ, which are well known to activate microglial cells to secrete neurotoxic factors, such as TNF-α and nitric oxide, behave similarly as freshly sonicated Aβ42. Although they induce no direct neurotoxicity when added directly, LPS/IFNγ activated BV2 cells to cause more than 60% cell death in primary cortical neurons (Fig. 1). Our data suggest that diverging molecular pathways may be involved in the activation of BV2 microglial cells induced by aged or soluble Aβ. Indeed, activation of BV2 cells by aged Aβ42 results in loss of Aβ-mediated neurotoxicity. This effect is likely due to secretion of Aβ-degrading enzymes and/or phagocytosis of aggregated Aβ. In contrast, activation by freshly sonicated Aβ results in secretion of neurotoxic factors. Therefore, identification of genes specifically involved in freshly sonicated Aβ42-induced activation of BV2 cells may lead to a better understanding of neurodegeneration caused by inflammatory conditions in AD. Identification of Genes That Are Up-regulated by Freshly Sonicated Aβ42—To identify genes involved in BV2 activation by freshly sonicated Aβ42, a large scale cDNA array expression profiling experiment was performed using BV2-specific arrays containing ∼50,000 clones (Fig. 2A). The cDNA clones were generated by amplifying the recombinant clone inserts derived from cDNA libraries enriched for transcripts from Aβ-treated BV2 cells through normalization and subtraction. This procedure decreased redundancy and increased the relative abundance of rare transcripts. To account for biological variability, the arrays were hybridized with three individual probes from BV2 cells treated with 5 μm freshly sonicated Aβ42 for 24 h. In the array screen of 50,000 clones, 9248 clones up-regulated by Aβ42 by a ratio of ≥1.2 in at least one of the Aβ-treated BV2 cell samples were identified and sequenced. Of the 9248 clones sequenced, 6929 clones yielded annotable sequence, based on the base call quality. These 6929 clones were contiged to 2176 unique transcripts to estimate the redundancy of the up-regulated clone selection. From the 6929 annotable clones, we selected 2851 clones that were up-regulated by Aβ42 by a ratio ≥ 1.2 in at least two BV2 cell samples (Fig. 2A). Following gene annotation of these 2851 clones, we identified 554 nonredundant genes whose expression was induced by more than 1.2-fold. Clones lacking annotation to a gene in NCBI RefSeq were not analyzed further. The 554 up-regulated genes were mapped using GO molecular function terms (27Ashburner M. et al.Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (27692) Google Scholar). We found a high percentage of functional mappings to enzymes (40%), especially hydrolases (14%), such as cathepsin B and cathepsin L, and oxidoreductases (7%) among other enzymes. In addition, of all functional mappings for the 554 genes, 29% of them map to the binding factors, including protein-binding (5%), nucleotide-binding (9%), nucleic acid-binding (10%), metal ion-binding (2%), and other binding factors (3%) (Fig. 2B). Finally, 32 of the 554 genes mapped to the GO molecular function unknown category, representing 3% of all functional mappings and 5% of all genes. The NCBI RefSeq accession numbers for all 554 up-regulated genes, along with corresponding array data, has been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus hosted by NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/, series submission number GSE772 and platform accession numbers GPL561 and GPL562). Expression Analysis of Cathepsins B and L, TIMP2, AIF1, and Cytochrome c—From the 554 genes, we selected a subgroup of genes from the two major functional mapping groups, namely enzymes and binding factors for further analysis. From the enzyme group, cathepsin B, cathepsin L, TIMP2, and cytochrome c oxidase were further analyzed for their roles in mediating inflammatory responses in microglia. AIF1, an IFNγ-inducible Ca2+-binding EF-hand protein, was selected from the binding factor group. Cathepsin B and L are lysosomal proteinases that are found extracellularly at high levels in the senile plaques of AD brain, which are known to contain activated microglia (36Cataldo A.M. Nixon R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3861-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Moreover, the activation and differentiation of mononuclear phagocytes is known to be accompanied by increased cathepsin B/L enzymatic activities (37Banati R.B. Rothe G. Valet G. Kreutzberg G.W. Glia. 1993; 7: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). TIMP2, a tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases, is one of the major endogenous counter-regulators of matrix metalloproteinases. Both matrix metalloproteinases and TIMPs are implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system (38Pagenstecher A. Stalder A.K. Kincaid C.L. Shapiro S.D. Campbell I.L. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 729-741PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase is known to be involved in apoptosis induced by various stressful stimuli, including inflammation (39Bal-Price A. Brown G.C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6480-6491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AIF1 has been associated with microglial activation in experimental models and in human cerebral infarctions (40Beschorner R. Engel S. Mittelbronn M. Adjodah D. Dietz K. Schluesener H.J. Meyermann R. Acta Neuropathol. 2000; 100: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We first used quantitative RT-PCR to confirm the gene regulation in sonicated Aβ-activated BV2 cells and compare gene regulation induced by sonicated and aged Aβ42. In addition, regulation by LPS/IFNγ, strong inflammatory stimuli, was used as a positive control for inflammatory responses. Of the five selected genes, we confirmed that the mRNA levels of all of them, except that of TIMP2, were significantly up-regulated by freshly sonicated Aβ42 in three or four independent experiments using quantitative RT-PCR (Table I, p < 0.05). Interestingly, three of the five selected genes, AIF1 and cathepsins B and L, were up-regulated by both LPS/IFNγ and freshly sonicated Aβ42, suggesting overlapping pathways shared by LPS/IFNγ and freshly sonicated Aβ42 stimulation. However, none of the three genes were up-regulated by aged Aβ42, supporting our previous finding that stimulation of BV2 cells by freshly sonicated Aβ42 and aged Aβ42 involves divergent pathways (Fig. 1). Although in the array analyses, mRNA of TIMP2 was shown to be up-regulated by freshly sonicated Aβ42 in a statistically significant manner (Average ratio = 1.35 ± 0.09, p < 0.01), we were not able to confirm the finding in three independent quantitative RT-PCR analyses. This discrepancy is likely due to nonspecific hybridization with other isoforms of TIMPs in the large scale array analysis because large cDNA fragments were used as probes. It is therefore very important to confirm the results from large scale profiling studies in more detailed studies, such as quantitative RT-PCR using isoformspecific primers.Table IGene regulation by LPS/IFNγ, sonicated Aβ42 and aged Aβ42 quantified by real time RT-PCR Quantifications were performed using the comparative cycle threshold method. The target transcripts were normalized to an endogenous reference, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and relative PCR efficiencies. The results were the means ± S.D. from two to four independent experiments performed in duplicate wells with different Aβ preparations (n = 4-8).

https://openalex.org/W2069184973,"Invasive forms of apicomplexan parasites contain secretory organelles called rhoptries that are essential for entry into host cells. We present a detailed characterization of an unusual rhoptry protein of the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, the rhoptry-associated membrane antigen (RAMA) that appears to have roles in both rhoptry biogenesis and host cell invasion. RAMA is synthesized as a 170-kDa protein in early trophozoites, several hours before rhoptry formation and is transiently localized within the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi within lipid-rich microdomains. Regions of the Golgi membrane containing RAMA bud to form vesicles that later mature into rhoptries in a process that is inhibitable by brefeldin A. Other rhoptry proteins such as RhopH3 and RAP1 are found in close apposition with RAMA suggesting direct protein-protein interactions. We suggest that RAMA is involved in trafficking of these proteins into rhoptries. In rhoptries, RAMA is proteolytically processed to give a 60-kDa form that is anchored in the inner face of the rhoptry membrane by means of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. The p60 RAMA form is discharged from the rhoptries of free merozoites and binds to the red blood cell membrane by its most C-terminal region. In early ring stages RAMA is found in association with the parasitophorous vacuole."

They are excluded from the immediate hydration shell of proteins and thereby stabilize their native structure. Despite their exclusion from protein surfaces, the periplasmic ligand-binding protein ProX from the Escherichia coli ATP-binding cassette transport system ProU binds the compatible solutes glycine betaine and proline betaine with high affinity and specificity. To understand the mechanism of compatible solute binding, we determined the high resolution structure of ProX in complex with its ligands glycine betaine and proline betaine. This crystallographic study revealed that cation-π interactions between the positive charge of the quaternary amine of the ligands and three tryptophan residues forming a rectangular aromatic box are the key determinants of the high affinity binding of compatible solutes by ProX.

The water content of bacterial cells is determined solely by osmotic processes as bacteria lack systems for active water transport into or out of the cell in response to an increase or a decrease of osmolarity in the environment (1Kempf B. Bremer E. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 2Booth I.R. Louis P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 166-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To cope with hyperosmotic conditions, non-halophilic microorganisms generally amass large quantities of a particular group of organic osmolytes, the so-called compatible solutes (3Brown A.D. Bacteriol. Rev. 1976; 40: 803-846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), either by de novo synthesis or by direct uptake from the environment (1Kempf B. Bremer E. Arch.

Compatible solutes are operationally defined as organic osmolytes that can be accumulated by the cell to exceedingly high concentrations without disturbing vital cellular functions or the correct folding of proteins (3Brown A.D. Bacteriol. Rev. 1976; 40: 803-846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their intracellular accumulation counteracts the osmotic efflux of water from the cell and thus contributes to the restoration of turgor (8Wood J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 230-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the resumption of growth of the bacterial cells under conditions of low water activity. In addition to contributing to the maintenance of cellular water content at high external osmolarities (9Record Jr., M.T. Courtenay E.S. Cayley D.S. Guttman H.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 143-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), compatible solutes also counteract destabilization of native structures of proteins upon freezing, heating, desiccation, and exposure to high ionic strength both in vitro and in vivo (10Lippert K.

The intracellular accumulation of compatible solutes as a strategy for adaptation to high osmolarity has been widely adopted not only by bacteria (5Galinski E.A. Trüper H.G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 15: 95-108Crossref Scopus (334) Google Scholar) and Archaea (16Da Costa M.S. Santos H. Galinski E.A. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 1998; 61: 117-153PubMed Google Scholar, 17Roberts M.F. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: 796-812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but also by fungal, plant, animal, and even human cells (18Burg M. Kwon E. Kültz D. Annu. Rev.

Moreover a few classes of compounds are used universally throughout the kingdoms, reflecting fundamental constraints on the type of solutes that are compatible with macromolecular and cellular functions (16Da Costa M.S. Santos H. Galinski E.A. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 1998; 61: 117-153PubMed Google Scholar, 21Le Rudulier D. Strøm A.R. Dandekar A.M. Smith L.T. Valentine R.C.

CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 81-109Google Scholar). One of the most ubiquitous compatible solutes used both by prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, is the trimethylammonium compound glycine betaine (N,N,N-trimethylglycine, GB). 1The abbreviations used are: GBglycine betaine (N,N,N-trimethylglycine)PBproline betaine (N,N-dimethyl-l-proline)X-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranosidePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidNCBINational Center for Biotechnology Information.1The abbreviations used are: GBglycine betaine (N,N,N-trimethylglycine)PBproline betaine (N,N-dimethyl-l-proline)X-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranosidePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidNCBINational Center for Biotechnology Information. The exact biochemical mechanism(s) through which compatible solutes act as protein stabilizers is not completely understood. Their functioning is generally explained in terms of the preferential exclusion model (23Arakawa T. Timasheff S.N. Biochem. J. 1985; 47: 411-414Scopus (813) Google Scholar). This hypothesis predicts that compatible solutes are excluded from the immediate hydration shell of proteins, which is apparently due to unfavorable interactions with protein surfaces (24Qu Y. Bolen C.L. Bolen D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9268-9273Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 25Bolen D.W. Baskakov I.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). This causes a non-homogeneous distribution of compatible solutes within the cell water and a preferential hydration of protein surfaces. Experimental verification came from neutron diffraction studies (26Lehmann M.S. Zaccai G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1939-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The nonuniform distribution of compatible solutes within the cell water results in a thermodynamic force that drives proteins to occupy a smaller volume to reduce the amount of excluded water, thereby stabilizing the native structure of proteins. glycine betaine (N,N,N-trimethylglycine) proline betaine (N,N-dimethyl-l-proline) 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid National Center for Biotechnology Information. glycine betaine (N,N,N-trimethylglycine) proline betaine (N,N-dimethyl-l-proline) 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid National Center for Biotechnology Information. Many Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial species that have been found to accumulate GB are able to acquire this compatible solute from environmental sources through high affinity transport systems (1Kempf B.

Milner J.L. Steer B.A. van Nues R.W. Wood J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and the multicomponent transport system ProU (32May G. Faatz E.

The ProU system is a member of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily (34Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar, 35Boos W. Lucht J M.

J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1923-1931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Access of GB present in the environment to the periplasmic ProX protein is provided by passive diffusion across the outer membrane through the OmpC and OmpF general porins of E. coli (36Faatz E. Middendorf A. Bremer E. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). ProX binds GB avidly with a KD of ∼1 μm (32May G. Faatz E. Villarejo M. Bremer E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 205: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 37Barron A. Jung J.U. Villarejo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11841-11846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Haardt M.

Driven by ATP hydrolysis, the translocation complex then transports the ligand into the cytoplasm (34Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar, 35Boos W. Lucht J M. Neidhard F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M.

Davidson A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9685-9690Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition to GB, the ProU transporter also serves as a high affinity uptake system for proline betaine (N,N-dimethyl-l-proline, PB), and this compatible solute is recognized by the ProX protein with high affinity (KD = 5 μm) as well (38Haardt M. Kempf B. Faatz E. Bremer E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). ProU also functions as an uptake system for a variety of other compatible solutes (e.g. proline and ectoine), but in contrast to GB and PB none of these compounds appear to be recognized by the ProX protein (37Barron A. Jung J.U. Villarejo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11841-11846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Haardt M. Kempf B. Faatz E. Bremer E. Mol. Gen.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5027-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The substrate-binding protein binds its ligand(s) selectively and with high affinity, which is thought to ensure the substrate specificity and directionality of the overall transport reaction for a given binding protein-dependent transport system (35Boos W. Lucht J M. Neidhard F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1175-1209Google Scholar). Periplasmic binding proteins are generally composed of two domains connected by one to three polypeptide chains forming a hinge between them. In the ligand-free open conformation the two rigid domains are flexibly linked by the hinge. This has been shown by the structural analysis of various open states of the ribose-binding protein and d-allose-binding protein (41Magnusson U. Chaudhuri B.N. Ko J. Park C. Jones A. Mowbray S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14077-14084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 42Björkman A.J. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 651-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Ligand binding induces a large conformational change in the hinge region that moves both domains toward each other. After this domain movement the ligand is engulfed in a predefined cleft between the two domains that refers to the closed conformation of the binding protein. Compatible solutes are apparently preferentially excluded from the immediate hydration shell of proteins (23Arakawa T. Timasheff S.N. Biochem. J. 1985; 47: 411-414Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 24Qu Y. Bolen C.L. Bolen D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9268-9273Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 25Bolen D.W. Baskakov I.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Yet a ligand-binding protein such as ProX binds the compatible solutes GB and PB with high affinity and high specificity (32May G. Faatz E. Villarejo M. Bremer E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 205: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 37Barron A. Jung J.U. Villarejo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11841-11846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Haardt M.

Microbiol. 1987; 133: 305-310PubMed Google Scholar). This observation raises the question as to how such a high affinity interaction between a compatible solute and a protein can take place. To understand the molecular determinants that govern substrate recognition and binding of compatible solutes by ProX, we determined the high resolution crystal structure of the ProX protein in complex with each of its ligands, i.e. ProX-GB and ProX-PB. This crystallographic analysis was combined with site-directed mutagenesis of the residues forming the ligand binding pocket of ProX to determine their relative importance for high affinity binding of the compatible solute GB by the ProX protein from E. coli. The analysis revealed cation-π interactions between the quaternary amine of GB and PB and the indole groups of three tryptophan residues. Overproduction and Purification of Wild-type and Mutant ProX Protein—The wild-type E. coli ProX protein was overproduced and purified to homogeneity essentially as described previously (44Breed J. Kneip S. Gade J. Welte W. Bremer E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In brief, the proX gene was overexpressed under the control of the bacterial phage T7ϕ10 promoter present on the proX+ low copy number plasmid pSK7 (Cmr) in the E. coli strain PD141 (λDE3) (44Breed J. Kneip S. Gade J. Welte W. Bremer E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This strain harbors a chromosomal copy of the gene for the phage T7 RNA polymerase under the control of an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible lacPO/lacI promoter system, thereby allowing the selective expression of the proX gene present on plasmid pSK7 from the T7ϕ10 promoter upon the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to the cell culture. Cells of strain PD141 (λDE3) (pSK7) were grown in a minimal medium (44Breed J. Kneip S. Gade J. Welte W. Bremer E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) in the presence of 30 μg ml-1 chloramphenicol because components of rich media (e.g. yeast extract) are known to contain GB (45Dulaney E.L. Dulaney D.D. Rickes E.L. Dev. Ind. Microbiol. 1968; 9: 260-269Google Scholar) that could potentially be scavenged and bound by ProX. In this way we ensured that the purified ProX protein was free of ligand since the E. coli strains used for overproduction are unable to synthesize GB. Overproduction of ProX was initiated by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the cell culture had reached an A578 of ∼1.0–1.5. After 1 h of further growth, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the periplasmic proteins were released from the cells by cold osmotic shock (46Neu H.C. Heppel L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 3685-3692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insoluble material was removed from the released periplasmic proteins by ultracentrifugation, and the supernatant was then subjected to fast protein liquid chromatography on a DEAE-Sepharose fast flow column (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were eluted from this anion exchange column with an increasing Tris-HCl (pH 8.3) gradient (16–400 mm). ProX-containing fractions were combined, and ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 1.5 m. This protein solution was then subjected to hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The ProX protein was eluted with a decreasing ammonium sulfate gradient (1.5–0 m ammonium sulfate dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3). The purified ProX protein was then dialyzed overnight against 5 liters of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3) buffer. The ProX protein was free from other contaminating proteins as judged from SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. ProX proteins with mutations in the substrate binding site were purified essentially as wild-type ProX protein except that the E. coli strain LinE2 (PD141 Δ(proU::spc)608) was used for the overexpression of the mutant proX genes present on derivatives of plasmid pSK7. Strain LinE2 carries a chromosomal deletion of the entire proU operon (38Haardt M. Kempf B. Faatz E. Bremer E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), thereby avoiding the contamination of the mutant ProX protein preparations with the wild-type ProX protein during protein purification. Genetic Construction of Bacterial Strains for Expression of Mutant ProX—To construct an E. coli strain that lacked the E. coli proU operon and that would allow phage T7ϕ10-mediated overexpression of plasmid-encoded mutant proX genes, we prepared a P1vir lysate (47Silhavy T.J. Berman M.L. Enquist L.W. Experiments with Gene Fusions. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1984: 18-27Google Scholar) on the proU-lacZ fusion strain BK16 (MC4100 ϕ(proU-lacZ)hyb2 λplacMu15 (Kanr)). 2B. Kempf and E. Bremer, unpublished results. Using this phage lysate, we transduced the lacZ gene fusion positioned next to the λplacMu15 (Kanr) prophage (49Bremer E. Silhavy T.J. Weinstock G.M.

Bremer, unpublished results. by selecting for kanamycin-resistant colonies (50 μg ml-1) in the presence of X-gal (300 μg ml-1) on Luria Bertani (LB) agar plates. One of these transductants was strain LinE1. We then replaced the ϕ(proU-lacZ)hyb2 λplacMu15 (Kanr) prophage in strain LinE1 with the Δ(proU::spc)608 deletion from strain MKH13 (38Haardt M. Kempf B. Faatz E. Bremer E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) by transducing strain LinE1 with a P1vir lysate prepared on strain MKH13 and selecting for spectinomycin-resistant colonies (100 μg ml-1) in the presence of X-gal on LB agar plates. The desired transductants carrying the Δ(proU::spc)608 deletion were identified as spectinomycin-resistant colonies that were kanamycin-sensitive and LacZ-. One of these transductants was strain LinE2. The absence of the ProX protein from strain LinE2 was verified by Western blotting analysis using a ProX antiserum and whole cell extracts prepared from cells grown in the presence of 250 mm NaCl in minimal medium. Site-directed Mutagenesis of the proX Gene—To probe the contributions of residues Trp65, Trp140, and Trp188 in ProX to GB binding, we mutated the corresponding codons in the proX gene via site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and custom synthesized primers (MWG-Biotech) containing the desired mutations. We replaced the codon for each of these Trp residues in proX with codons encoding the amino acids Ala, Leu, Phe, Tyr, Asp, or Glu in plasmid pSK7 by following the protocol provided by Stratagene. The entire coding region of the mutant proX genes was then sequenced to ensure the presence of the desired mutation and the absence of unwanted alterations in the proX coding region. DNA sequencing was carried out by the chain terminating method (51Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) with the Thermo Sequenase fluorescent labeled primer cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). The DNA sequencing reactions were primed with synthetic oligonucleotides labeled at their 5′ end with the infrared dye IRD-800 (MWG-Biotech), and the products were analyzed using a LI-COR DNA sequencer (model 4000, MWG Biotech). Each of the mutant proX alleles chosen for overproduction of the altered ProX proteins contained only the desired mutations in the codons encoding residues Trp65, Trp140, or Trp188 (pLB2, W188A; pLB3, W188L; pLB4, W188F; pLB5, W188Y; pLB6, W140A; pLB7, W140L; pLB8, W140F; pLB9, W140Y; pLB10, W65A; pLB11, W65L; pLB12, W65F; pLB13, W65Y; pLB14, W188D; pLB15, W188E; pLB16, W140D; pLB17, W140E; pLB18, W65D; and pLB19, W65E). A double mutant containing replacements of the amino acids at positions Trp65 and Trp140 were constructed by remutating plasmid pLB10 to yield plasmid pLB20 (W65A,W140A). The mutant proX pLB plasmids were each introduced by electroporation into the E. coli strain LinE2 (Δ(proU::spc)608), and 4 liters of minimal medium with 0.4% (w/v) glucose as the carbon source were used for the overproduction of the mutant ProX proteins. Usually we obtained between 10 and 20 mg of purified ProX protein from 4 liters of cell culture. Binding of Radiolabeled GB to ProX and Its Mutant Derivatives— The binding affinity of the wild-type ProX protein and its mutant derivatives constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of proX was measured by using an ammonium sulfate precipitation assay (52Richarme G. Kepes A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Purified ProX protein (5 μm, determined using the BCA assay) was incubated with nine different concentrations of radiolabeled GB (1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 110 μm) in a 100-μl reaction volume of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3) for 5 min at room temperature. Then the ProX protein was precipitated with 900 μl of ice-cold saturated ammonium sulfate solution. After an incubation of 10 min on ice, the precipitated ProX protein was collected by filtration onto a nitrocellulose filter (pore size, 0.45 μm; Schleicher & Schuell), the filter was then washed with 10 ml of an ice-cold ammonium sulfate solution, and the radioactivity retained by ProX on the filter was determined by scintillation counting. Each measurement was repeated three times for each concentration to determine the binding constant and the S.D. A mutant is treated as non-binding if no binding, either specific or unspecific, occurs at a concentration of 110 μm GB (Table III). According to the properties of the compatible solute GB presented in the Introduction, we do not expect unspecific binding of GB to ProX at this rather low concentration.Table IIIBinding affinities of GB to wild-type ProX and ProX derivativesTrp65Trp140Trp188KDS.D.KDS.D.KDS.D.μmμmμmWild type40.140.140.1Trp → Phe40.130.340.4Trp → Tyr130.640.550.2Trp → Ala503.35610—a—, indicates non-binding ProX mutants.

Kneip S. Gade J. Welte W. Bremer E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In brief, protein (10 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.3) was diluted 1:1 with a reservoir solution containing 26–28% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 and 50 mm PIPES, pH 6.2–6.4. The crystals grew within 4–6 weeks and belong to the space group P212121 with unit cell parameters of a = 48.0, b = 55.0, and c = 115.7 Å containing one monomer per asymmetric unit. In complex with GB, ProX crystals were quite resistant to damage by heavy atoms; both high concentrations and long soak times were possible. Two derivative crystals of ProX-GB were obtained by soaking of the crystals either with 10 mm methylmercuric(II) chloride (CH3HgCl) for 48 h or with 5 mm trimethyllead acetate ((CH3)3PbAc) for 72 h at room temperature. Data sets of the derivative crystals and a native crystal of ProX-PB were collected at room temperature using a rotating anode generator (Schneider, Offenburg, Germany) equipped with a Mar345 imaging plate detector (MarResearch, Hamburg, Germany). A native data set of ProX-GB was collected at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory outstation Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron Hamburg beamline BW7B under cryogenic conditions. For this purpose the crystals were soaked in reservoir solution with stepwise increasing glycerol concentrations up to a final concentration of 25% (v/v) glycerol and then transferred to liquid nitrogen. All data sets were processed using XDS (53Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3200) Google Scholar) as summarized in Table I.

In primary rat hepatocytes, pO2 modulated insulin-dependent glucokinase (GK) gene expression was abolished by wortmannin an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Transfection of vectors encoding the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K or constitutively active proteinkinase B (PKB) stimulated GK mRNA and protein expression. The transfection of GK promoter constructs together with expression vectors for p110 or constitutively active PKB revealed that the GK promoter region –87/–80 mediates the response to PI3K/PKB. Transfection experiments and gel shift assays show that this element is able to bind hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in a hypoxia- and PKB-dependent manner. The ability of HIF-1α to activate the GK promoter was enhanced by hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α (HNF-4α), acting via the sequence –52/–39, and by the coactivator p300. Stimulation of the GK promoter by insulin was dependent on the intact –87/–80 region and maximal stimulation was achieved when HIF-1α, HNF-4, and p300 were cotransfected with the –1430 GK promoter Luc construct in primary hepatocytes. Maximal stimulation of GK promoter activity by insulin was inhibited when a p300 vector was used containing a mutation within a PKB phosphorylation site. Thus, a regulatory transcriptional complex consisting of HIF-1, HNF-4, and p300 appears to be involved in insulin-dependent GK gene activation.

The mammalian enzyme glucokinase (GK), 1The abbreviations used are: GK, glucokinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKB, proteinkinase B; myrPKB, myristoylated PKB; HNF, hepatocyte nuclear factor; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; SREBP, sterol-regulatory element-binding protein; USF, upstream stimulatory factor; HRE, hypoxia-responsive element; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; EPO, erythropoietin; CREB, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein. also termed hexokinase IV, is a key enzyme of glucose utilization, playing a crucial role in maintaining blood glucose homeostasis. In contrast to the other hexokinase family members (hexokinase I–III), GK has a lower affinity for glucose with sigmoidal kinetics and is not inhibited by its reaction product glucose 6-phosphate. Compared with the other hexokinases with a molecular mass of about 100 kDa, GK has a molecular mass of only 50 kDa and binds to a glucokinase regulatory protein, which decreases its affinity for glucose. These attributes allow the GK enzyme to react adequately with glucose in concentrations reached in vivo (1.Vandercammen A. Van S.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 2.Printz R.L. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Annu. Rev.

GK expression is restricted to hepatocytes, the pancreatic β-cells, some neuroendocrine cells of the gastrointestinal tract, and the brain (4.Jetton T.L. Liang Y. Pettepher C.C. Zimmerman E.C. Cox F.G. Horvath K. Matschinsky F.M. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3641-3654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin is a major regulator of GK gene expression in the liver. In primary hepatocytes, insulin concentrations from 10–10m up to 10–8m stimulate GK mRNA levels in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas glucagon and its second messenger cAMP inhibits GK expression (5.Iynedjian P.B. Jotterand D. Nouspikel T. Asfari M. Pilot P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21824-21829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of insulin to stimulate GK expression is positively modulated by perivenous pO2 (6.Kietzmann T. Roth U. Freimann S. Jungermann K. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), consistent with the predominant localization of GK in the less aerobic perivenous area of the liver acinus (7.Jungermann K. Kietzmann T. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1996; 16: 179-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Following insulin binding to its receptor and receptor autophosphorylation, insulin signaling involves second messengers including members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades (8.Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3935) Google Scholar). PI3K, which generates phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-phosphate, plays a key role in the metabolic actions of insulin (9.Shepherd P.R. Nave B.T. Rincon J. Haigh R.J. Foulstone E. Proud C. Zierath J.R. Siddle K. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 1172-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-phosphate regulates the activity or subcellular localization of a variety of signaling molecules such as phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase and protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt) (10.Lietzke S.E.

Besides its major role in the transmission of the insulin signal (8.Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3935) Google Scholar), the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway appears also to be involved in the oxygen signaling cascade, regulating the activity of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) (12.Zhong H.

Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 363-369PubMed Google Scholar). HIF-1 is composed of an inducible subunit (HIF-1α) and a constitutively expressed subunit (HIF-1β, also known as ARNT), and both are members of the basic helix-loop-helix-PAS protein family. HIF-1 is involved in hypoxia-dependent induction of a variety of genes, including erythropoietin, glycolytic enzymes, but also plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (14.Samoylenko A.

The transcription factors mediating the modulation of the insulin-dependent GK gene expression by perivenous pO2 in hepatocytes, and thus the zonated GK expression in liver, are not yet known. Transcription factors that could be involved include the HIF-1, sterol-regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) (28.Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, it was the aim of this study to investigate whether the PI3K/PKB pathway and the factors HIF-1, HNF-4, and p300 are involved in mediating the effect of insulin on GK gene expression. All biochemicals and enzymes were of analytical grade and were purchased from commercial suppliers. Animals—Male Wistar rats (200–260 g) were kept on a 12 h day/night rhythm (light from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.) with free access to water and food. Rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (60 mg/kg body weight) prior to preparation of hepatocytes between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. Plasmid Constructs—The reporter plasmid rat GK-1430 LUC was constructed by inserting a BglII-HindIII GK promoter fragment (–1430/+21) into pGL3 basic from Promega (Heidelberg, Germany). The reporter plasmid GK-101 LUC or GK-101HREm LUC which contains a mutation in the hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) (–87/–80) were constructed by inserting a SmaI-XhoI promoter fragment (–101/+79) (36.Fleischmann M.

Cell Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Liver cells were isolated by collagenase perfusion and maintained under standard conditions in an atmosphere of periportal pO2 (16% O2/79% N2/5% CO2 (by volume)) in medium M199 containing 0.5 nm insulin added as a growth factor for culture maintenance, 100 nm dexamethasone required as a permissive hormone, and, until the first change of medium after 5 h, 4% newborn calf serum, as described previously (42.Immenschuh S.

In brief, 2 μg of the respective LUC construct was transfected with 500 ng of p110, PKB-WT, myrPKB, SREBP-1a, HIF-1α, or HNF-4 and/or p300 expression vectors or with appropriate amounts of the respective empty expression vectors. After 5 h, the medium was changed and the cells were cultured under periportal pO2 (16% O2) for 19 h, then the medium was changed again and the cells were further cultured for 24 h under periportal pO2. Western Blot Analysis—Protein from primary cultured hepatocytes and transiently transfected hepatocytes were isolated as described previously (43.Wiesener M.S. Turley H. Allen W.E. Willam C.

The protein content was determined using the Bradford method. 50 μg of protein dissolved in 27 μl of SDS sample buffer was loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Nonspecific binding was blocked with blocking buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% milk powder). Blots were incubated with primary goat antibody against GK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) in a 1:200 dilution or with 1:1000 dilution of the rabbit antibodies against phospho-PKB/Akt (Thr308), phospho-PKB/Akt (Ser473), or total PKB/Akt (New England Biolabs, Heidelberg, Germany) in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Washing was performed with blocking buffer without milk powder. The secondary antibodies were anti-goat IgG (Dako, Hamburg, Germany) or anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) used in a 1:2000 dilution for 1 h. The primary rabbit antibody against golgi membrane (Bioscience, Göttingen, Germany) was used in a 1:8000 dilution. The secondary antibody was a goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), used in a 1:2000 dilution. After washing for 30 min, the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) was used for detection. Under these conditions, GK was visible as a band of 53 kDa and PKB as a band of about 60 kDa. RNA Preparation and Northern Analysis—Isolation of total RNA and Northern analysis were performed as described previously (6.Kietzmann T. Roth U. Freimann S. Jungermann K. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNAs served as hybridization probes; they were generated by in vitro transcription from pBS-GK-1 using T3 RNA polymerase or from pBS-β-actin using T7 RNA polymerase and RNA labeling mixture containing 3.5 mm 11-digoxigenin-UTP, 6.5 mm UTP, 10 mm GTP, 10 mm CTP, and 10 mm ATP. Hybridizations and detections were carried out essentially as described previously (6.Kietzmann T. Roth U. Freimann S. Jungermann K. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Blots were quantified with a videodensitometer (Biotech Fischer, Reiskirchen, Germany). Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared by modification of a standard protocol (41.Kietzmann T. Roth U. Jungermann K.

Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The sequence of the GK-HRE oligonucleotide was 5′-ACCCCACGTGGTTCTTTGT-3′. Equal amounts of complementary oligonucleotides were annealed and labeled by 5′-end labeling with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (MBI, St. Leon-Rot, Germany). They were purified with the Nucleotide Removal Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Binding reactions were carried out in a total volume of 20 μl containing 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 10 μg of nuclear extract, 250 ng of poly(dI-dC), and 5 mm dithioerythritol. After preincubation for 5 min at room temperature, 1 μl of the labeled probe (104 cpm) was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 10 min. For supershift analysis either 1 μl rat HIF-1α antibody (41.Kietzmann T. Roth U. Jungermann K. Blood. 1999; 94: 4177-4185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), USF-2 antibody (N18), or Myc (C33) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the EMSA reaction and then incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The electrophoresis was then performed with a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 5 mm EDTA) at 200 V. After electrophoresis the gels were dried and analyzed by phosphorimaging (41.Kietzmann T. Roth U. Jungermann K. Blood. 1999; 94: 4177-4185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar). Venous pO2 Enhances Phosphorylation of PKB by Insulin in Primary Rat Hepatocytes—The signaling pathway(s) mediating the effects of insulin and pO2 on GK gene expression are unknown. Since insulin can exert effects on gene expression via PI3K and PKB (45.Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that perivenous pO2 may modulate the activation of the PI3K/PKB pathway or its downstream targets in primary hepatocytes. Therefore, we examined the activation of PKB in hepatocytes that were cultured under periportal and perivenous pO2 and stimulated with insulin. After insulin stimulation, the levels of serine 473-phosphorylated PKB were enhanced by about 7-fold under periportal pO2 and by about 10-fold under perivenous pO2. Threonine 308 phosphorylation of PKB protein was enhanced by about 2-fold under periportal pO2 and by about 4-fold under perivenous pO2. In contrast, the level of total PKB protein was not modulated by venous pO2 neither under control conditions or after insulin treatment (Fig. 1). The modulation by O2 of the insulin-induced PKB phosphorylation indicates a possible involvement of PKB mediating the effects of O2 on insulin-dependent GK expression. Induction of Glucokinase Expression by Insulin and by Overexpression of the PI3K Catalytic Subunit p110 or a Constitutively Active PKB in Primary Rat Hepatocytes: Inhibition by Wortmannin—To investigate whether the effects of insulin on GK mRNA expression is mediated via PI3K and/or PKB, rat hepatocytes were treated with insulin and/or the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin or transfected with an expression vector encoding a constitutively active form of PKB (myrPKB). Under periportal pO2 conditions, insulin treatment increased GK mRNA levels by about 6-fold (Fig. 2). Wortmannin completely inhibited the insulin-dependent GK mRNA induction. In the myrPKB-transfected cells, the GK mRNA level was enhanced by about 15-fold and was not increased further by treatment with insulin (Fig. 2). The PI3K- and PKB-dependent regulation of GK protein also was examined. The level of GK protein was increased by insulin treatment under venous pO2 by about 9-fold (Fig. 3). When the vectors encoding the catalytic PI3K subunit p110 or myrPKB were transfected into hepatocytes, GK protein levels were enhanced by about 10-fold and 14-fold, respectively (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Induction of glucokinase expression by overexpression of p110 or PKB-WT in primary rat hepatocytes. Hepatocytes transfected either with p110 or PKB-WT expression vectors were cultured for 24 h under periportal pO2. At 24 h the medium was changed, and cells were further cultured for the next 24 h under periportal pO2. The untransfected cells were cultured under periportal and perivenous pO2. A total of 50 μg of protein of the cultured hepatocytes was subjected to Western analysis with an antibody against GK and as loading control against golgi membrane (GM) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Autoradiographic signals were obtained by chemiluminescence and scanned by videodensitometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Stimulation of GK Promoter-controlled LUC Expression by Overexpression of p110 or PKB in Primary Rat Hepatocytes—To further investigate the role of PI3K and PKB in regulating GK expression we investigated whether GK promoter activity is regulated via the PI3K-PKB-pathway and cotransfected primary rat hepatocytes with liver-specific GK promoter LUC gene constructs and expression vectors encoding p110, PKB-WT, or myrPKB. Cotransfection of hepatocytes with the p110 vector together with GK-1430 LUC, containing the entire liver-specific GK promoter, enhanced Luc activity by about 2-fold (Fig. 4). Cotransfection with PKB-WT, increased luciferase activity by about 3-fold, while cotransfection with the myrPKB vector mediated an induction of Luc activity by about 4.3-fold. Similarly, cotransfection with the p110, PKB-WT, or myrPKB expression vectors stimulated promoter activity in a LUC gene construct containing the wild-type 101-bp rat GK promoter (GK-101 LUC) by about 2-fold. By contrast, the p110, PKB-WT, and myrPKB expression plasmids did not result in the activation of the GK-1430 HREm and GK-101 HREm constructs, where the P2 region (–87/–80) containing a putative binding site for HIF-1 has been mutated. These results indicate that factors binding to the putative HRE located in the proximal GK promoter could be targets of PKB signaling.

Cotransfection of GK-1430 LUC with a plasmid encoding SREBP-1a enhanced the Luc activity by about 2.8-fold (Fig. 5). In contrast, the SREBP-1a vector did not stimulate promoter activity in cells transfected with either the GK-101 LUC or GK-101 HREm LUC gene constructs (Fig. 5). When GK-1430 LUC was cotransfected with an expression vector for HIF-1α, luciferase activity was enhanced by about 3.3-fold. The HIF-1α mediated induction of Luc activity was also visible when the GK-101 LUC construct was cotransfected with the HIF-1α expression vector. By contrast, when GK-101 HREm LUC was cotransfected with the HIF-1α vector the HIF-1α-dependent increase in Luc activity was attenuated (Fig. 5). Together, these studies indicate that the activation of GK promoter LUC gene constructs by SREBP is not mediated by the GK-HRE. Instead, this site may mediate the activation of the GK promoter by HIF-1. These results also indicate that SREBP proteins also may contribute to the full effect of insulin on GK expression-just not through this element. Positive Modulation of Protein Binding to the HRE Sequence of the Rat GK Promoter by Hypoxia and Overexpression of PKB—To further substantiate that HIF-1 may be involved in the signaling cascade activating GK expression via the HRE downstream from PKB, we examined binding of nuclear proteins to an oligonucleotide probe containing the GK-HRE by EMSA. The GK-HRE oligonucleotide (–91/–71) was able to form two complexes with nuclear proteins prepared from primary hepatocytes. The formation of the slower migrating complex was enhanced when nuclear extracts were prepared from cells cultured under venous pO2 (mild hypoxia). By contrast, the ability of nuclear extracts to form the faster migrating complex was not altered by changes in pO2 (Fig. 6). Since the sequence of the GK-HRE was previously shown to be involved in binding of USF proteins, it was possible tha"
https://openalex.org/W2045742924,"Increased resistance to apoptosis is a hallmark of many tumor cells. The functional inhibition of specific antiapoptotic factors may provide a rational basis for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. We investigated here whether the RNA interference (RNAi) technology could be used to increase the apoptotic susceptibility of cancer cells. As a molecular target, we chose the antiapoptotic livin (ML-IAP, KIAP) gene, which is expressed in a subset of human tumors. We identified vector-borne small interfering (si)RNAs, which could efficiently block endogenous livin gene expression. Silencing of livin was associated with caspase-3 activation and a strongly increased apoptotic rate in response to different proapoptotic stimuli, such as doxorubicin, UV-irradiation, or TNFalpha. The effects were specific for Livin-expressing tumor cells. Our results (i) provide direct evidence that the intracellular interference with livin gene expression resensitizes human tumor cells to apoptosis, (ii) define the livin gene as a promising molecular target for therapeutic inhibition, and (iii) show that the livin gene is susceptible to efficient and specific silencing by the siRNA technology."

The purpose of the study described here was different: we wanted to examine how two very different antibiotic resistance mechanisms, based either on mecA or on vanA, are expressed in the same S. aureus cell and what impact the enterococcal vanA gene complex may have on the structure of the staphylococcal cell wall. The mechanism of vanA-mediated vancomycin resistance, at least when it is expressed in enterococci, involves the production of a cell wall precursor with abnormal chemical structure (for recent review see Ref. 6Boneca I.G. Chiosis G. Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2003; 7: 311-328Google Scholar).

These genetic determinants may provide useful tools for the dissection of the vanA- and mecA-mediated resistance mechanisms. Construction of Strain COLVA by Filter Mating—In the filter mating experiments the recipient used was the MRSA strain COL, and the donor was the clinical VRSA isolate HIP11714, which carried transposon Tn1546 on pLW1043. Overnight cultures of donor and recipient grown in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth (Difco, Detroit, MI) were mixed in a 10 to 1 ratio in favor of the donor cells, filtered onto a Nalge 22-μg filter under vacuum followed by incubation of the filters, “face up,” on antibiotic-free BHI agar at 37 °C for 18 h. After incubation, the bacteria were eluted into BHI broth and plated on agar containing 50 μg/ml vancomycin plus 4 μg/ml tetracycline (selective marker for the recipient). One of the five transconjugants was purified by two consecutive single colony isolations on the selective agar and was transferred to the Laboratory at the Rockefeller University where the purity and stability of the drug resistance trait was retested and the transconjugant was named strain COLVA. Strains and Growth Conditions—S. aureus strains were grown in tryptic soy broth (TSB) (Difco) at 37 °C with aeration. Growth was monitored by measuring the optical density at 600 nm with an LKB spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). In some experiments, peptidoglycan and cell wall precursor analyses were performed on bacteria grown in the presence of 125 or 250 μg/ml vancomycin and also in 10 μg/ml oxacillin. In these experiments the overnight cultures grown in TSB supplemented with the antibiotics were diluted into fresh TSB medium containing the same antibiotic concentration. Testing Antibiotic Susceptibility—Antibiotic resistance level and synergistic activity of antibiotics were determined by the E-test following the recommendations by the manufacturer (Ab Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) and by the method of population analysis (23Tomasz A. Nachman S. Leaf H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1991; 35: 124-129Google Scholar). Preparation and Analysis of Peptidoglycan—Cell wall peptidoglycan was prepared, purified, and solubilized by enzymatic hydrolysis using previously described methods (10Boneca I.G. Huang Z.-H. Gage D.A. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9910-9918Google Scholar, 11Ornelas-Soares A. de Lencastre H. de Jonge B. Gage D. Chang Y.-S. Tomasz A. J. Biol.

The muropeptides liberated by the enzymatic hydrolysis were reduced by borohydride and separated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a Shimadzu LC-10A HPLC system as described before (13de Jonge B.L. Chang Y.-S. Gage D. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11248-11254Google Scholar). The peaks of interest were isolated and desalted by HPLC (13de Jonge B.L. Chang Y.-S. Gage D. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11248-11254Google Scholar), and MS analysis was performed. Preparation of UDP-linked Peptidoglycan Precursors and Analysis by HPLC—Cytoplasmic pools of the UDP-linked precursors were extracted by a method previously described (24Mengin-Lecreulx D. Flouret B. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 1109-1117Google Scholar) with some modification (25Sieradzki K. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2557-2566Google Scholar). In strains COL and COLVA grown in antibiotic-free medium, bacitracin (100 μg/ml or 2× MIC) was added to the cultures 30 min before harvesting the cells to amplify the amounts of cell wall precursors. Recent experiments in our laboratory have shown that bacitracin, an inhibitor of the regeneration of bactoprenylphosphate in the membrane transfer reaction of cell walls synthesis (26Stone K.J. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 3223-3227Google Scholar, 27Storm D.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1974; 235: 387-398Google Scholar) can be successfully used instead of vancomycin (28Billot-Klein D. Gutmann L. Bryant D. Bell D. van Heijenoort J. Grewal J. Shlaes D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4696-4703Google Scholar) for the amplification of the cell wall precursor pool. Analysis was performed with a Shimadzu LC-10A HPLC system. Samples were applied to a 250- × 4.6-mm reversed-phase HPLC column (ODS-Hypersil, 3 μm, Keystone Scientific, Bellefonte, PA). The column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with a linear gradient of 5% (v/v) methanol in 100 mm ammonium formate (pH 3.5) to 30% (v/v) methanol in 100 mm ammonium formate (pH 3.5) in 30 min. The pH of buffers was adjusted by formic acid. Column temperature was 40 °C. The eluted compounds were detected by absorption at 254 nm. This method was used to analyze precursors by HPLC coupled to mass spectrometer (LC-MS) (29Hemling M.E. Roberts G.D. Johnson W. Carr S.A. Covey T.R. Biomed. Environ. Mass Spectrom. 1990; 19: 677-691Google Scholar, 30Eshraghi J. Chowdhury S.K. Anal. Chem. 1993; 65: 3528-3533Google Scholar). The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min for the HPLC separation, and it was reduced to 50 μl/min before the ion source. To improve the separation of early precursors (UDP-MurNAc and UDP-MurNAc-Ala) the method was modified: the pH of the 100 mm ammonium formate was adjusted to pH 2.5 by HCl. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Samples of muropeptides were isolated by HPLC, lyophilized, and dissolved in H2O:CH3CN (50:50, v/v). A sample was injected at a flow rate of 50 μl/min into a Micromass quadrupole time-of-flight electrospray mass spectrometer operating in the positive ion mode. A MS/MS analysis (31Hunt D.F. Zhu N.Z.

Chem. 1991; 63: 1193-1200Google Scholar) of UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Lac was performed at a pressure of 15 p.s.i. with argon as the collision gas (collision energy 25 eV). It produced ions corresponding to the MurNAc-l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Lac and Lac-l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Lac moieties of the molecules. The latter fragment ion was subjected to an additional stage of MS/MS analysis (collision energy 30 eV) using a nozzle-skimmer MS/MS technique (33Loo J.A. Edmonds C.G. Smith R.D. Science. 1990; 248: 201-204Google Scholar, 34Loo J.A. Edmonds C.G. Smith R.D. Anal. Chem. 1991; 63: 2488-2499Google Scholar) with a cone voltage set at 50 V. Expression of High Level Resistance to Oxacillin and Vancomycin in Strain COLVA—Strain COLVA grown overnight either in TSB or in TSB supplemented with 100 μg/ml vancomycin were tested for susceptibility to oxacillin and vancomycin by the E-test. The cultures grown in TSB showed high level resistance to oxacillin (MIC, 800 μg/ml) (Fig. 1A) and the culture grown in vancomycin showed high-level vancomycin resistance (MIC: 512 μg/ml) (Fig. 1B). Composition of the Cell Wall Peptidoglycan of Strain COLVA Grown in Antibiotic-free and Antibiotic-containing Media—The HPLC elution profile of muropeptides recovered from the peptidoglycan of strain COL was compared with that of strain COLVA with both strains grown in antibiotic-free TSB. The two elution profiles were virtually identical, except that in strain COLVA next to many of the familiar muropeptide peaks of strain COL (13de Jonge B.L. Chang Y.-S. Gage D. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11248-11254Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, top panel) there was often a small secondary peak eluting from the HPLC column with slightly shorter retention times (see arrows in Fig. 2, second panel). In COLVA grown in the presence of vancomycin these novel peaks became the dominant muropeptide species of the peptidoglycan (Fig. 2, third panel). Growth of COLVA in the presence of oxacillin (10 μg/ml) caused a virtual disappearance of all but one (peak 3v) of the novel peaks and the peptidoglycan composition changed to a profile characteristic of strain COL grown in the presence of β-lactam antibiotics (13de Jonge B.L. Chang Y.-S. Gage D. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11248-11254Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, bottom panel). Structure of the Muropeptide Components in Strain COLVA Grown in Vancomycin-containing Medium—The novel muropeptide peaks that became dominant in the vancomycin-grown cells were purified and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. Table I shows the experimental and theoretical molecular masses obtained for the 22 new muropeptide species detected. The proposed chemical structures derived from the data are shown in Fig. 3. The most striking and novel features of these muropeptides are (i) the complete replacement of pentapeptides by tetrapeptides and (ii) the frequent deficit and/or complete lack of pentaglycine branches in muropeptides particularly in muropeptide monomers and in the biosynthetically “first” donor components of oligomeric muropeptides. Also apparent were structural modifications in some muropeptides that we interpret as evidence for lack of amidation of the stempeptide glutamic acid residues (muropeptide 4v) and the presence of deacetylated (16v and 17v) and O-acetylated (6v) hexosamines. The percent representation of various muropeptide peaks in bacteria grown under different conditions is illustrated in Table II.Table IMolecular weight and suggested amino acid composition of cell wall muropeptides isolated from vancomycin-resistant strain COLVAMolecular massMuropeptide compositionPeakaMuropeptide peak numbers are as in Fig. 1.

Open table in a new tab Composition of the Cell Wall Precursor Pool—Fig. 4 shows the composition of the cytoplasmic cell wall precursor pool in strains COL and COLVA grown either in antibiotic-free medium or in media supplemented with antibiotics. These are the same growth conditions that were tested for their effect on the composition of the peptidoglycan in Fig. 2. In strains COL and COLVA grown in antibiotic-free TSB, the HPLC separation combined with mass spectrometric analysis identified six components in the precursor pool that were common and were present in comparable amounts in both strains (see peaks 1–4, 6, and 7 in Fig. 4, first and second panels). An additional minor component (peak 8) was only detected in strain COLVA. Peaks 1–4 and 6 were identified as the well known cell wall muropeptide precursors: UDP-MurNAc (peak 1), UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala (peak 2), UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu-l-Lys (peak 3), UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu (peak 4), and the pentapeptide derivative of UDP-MurNAc, UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala (peak 6) (35Flouret B. Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 59-63Google Scholar), the latter representing close to 80% of the precursor material. An additional minor peak 7 was identified in both COL and COLVA as a derivative of the UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide carrying a single glycine substitute on the ϵ-amino group of the lysine residue. The precursor pool of COLVA (but not COL) also contained an additional minor component (peak 8), which had HPLC retention time and molecular mass characteristic of the UDP-MurNAc-depsipeptide, UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Lac, described in vancomycin-resistant enterococci (36Handwerger S. Pucci M.J. Volk K.J. Liu J. Lee M.S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5982-5984Google Scholar, 37Bugg T.D.H. Wright G.D. Dutka-Malen S. Arthur M. Courvalin P. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10408-10415Google Scholar). Radically different results were obtained when the cell wall precursor pool was analyzed from COLVA grown in vancomycin-containing medium (Fig. 4, third panel). Although peaks 1–4 appeared to be present unchanged, peak 6, the major component in the bacteria grown without vancomycin, was diminished and was replaced by two new major components (peaks 5 and 8). In addition several minor components were also present. Mass spectrometric analysis of peak 5 identified it as the UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu-l-Lys-d-Ala tetrapeptide. Peak 8 had a retention time of 21 min on the HPLC elution profile and a molecular mass that differed by 1 mass unit from that of the UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide. The composition of the cell wall precursor pool in strain COLVA grown in TSB supplemented with 10 μg/ml oxacillin (Fig. 4, bottom panel) was indistinguishable from the precursor profile of COLVA grown in drug-free TSB, including even the presence of small amounts of the UDP-MurNAc-depsipeptide (peak 8). The percentage representation of various compounds in the cytoplasmic cell wall precursor pool in COL and COLVA grown under different conditions is shown in Table III.Table IIIComposition of cell wall precursor pool in the vancomycin-susceptible strain COL andvancomycin-resistant strain COLVARelative amounts of precursorPeak numberPrecursorNo antibioticsCOLVA + vancomycinCOLVA + oxacillinaTo accumulate cytoplasmic precursor, cells were exposed for the last 30 min of growth to 100 μg/ml bacitracin (see “Experimental Procedures”).COLVA-ΔmecA + vancomycinCOLaTo accumulate cytoplasmic precursor, cells were exposed for the last 30 min of growth to 100 μg/ml bacitracin (see “Experimental Procedures”).COLVAaTo accumulate cytoplasmic precursor, cells were exposed for the last 30 min of growth to 100 μg/ml bacitracin (see “Experimental Procedures”).1UDP-MurNAc16.713.87.614.613.52UDP-MurNAc-Ala21.117.77.919.18.83 and 4bPeaks 3 and 4 were integrated togetherUDP-MurNAc-Ala-Glu-Lys +UDP-MurNAc-Ala-Glu1.72.60.32.93.15UDP-MurNAc-Ala-Glu-Lys-Ala0.00.027.00.028.96UDP-MurNAc-Ala-Glu-Lys-Ala-Ala57.061.51.358.61.47UDP-MurNAc-Ala-Glu-Lys(Gly)-Ala-Ala1.31.30.01.40.08UDP-MurNAc-Ala-Glu-Lys-Ala-Lac0.01.034.61.839.09UDP-MurNAc-Ala-Glu-Lys(Gly)-Ala-Lac0.00.0<10.00.0Total9898799895a To accumulate cytoplasmic precursor, cells were exposed for the last 30 min of growth to 100 μg/ml bacitracin (see “Experimental Procedures”).b Peaks 3 and 4 were integrated together Open table in a new tab Confirmation of the Structure of UDP-MurNAc-depsipeptide by MS/MS Analysis—LC/MS analysis (29Hemling M.E.

Chem. 1993; 65: 3528-3533Google Scholar) running in the positive ion mode showed that the peak 8 at retention time 21.0 min (Fig. 4) has a molecular ion mass [M+H]+ of m/z 1151.6. This molecular ion matched the predicted value of 1150.35 Da for UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Lac. To provide a rigorous proof for the proposed structure, MS/MS analysis of the molecular ion was performed (Fig. 5). Fragmentation of the molecular ion at m/z 1151.6 gave two product ions at m/z 747.5 and 562.4 that corresponded to the loss of UDP and UDP-GlcNAc from the precursor ion, respectively (Fig. 5, A and C). The ion at m/z 562.4 corresponds to the structure Lac-l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Lac. The first lactate at the N-terminal in this fragment came from the cleavage of muramic acid between N-acetylglucosamine and lactate. To obtain the sequence of the peptide, further fragmentation (Fig. 5B) of the ion at m/z 562.4 was performed by generating the precursor ion at the nozzle skimmer (33Loo J.A. Edmonds C.G. Smith R.D. Science. 1990; 248: 201-204Google Scholar, 34Loo J.A. Edmonds C.G. Smith R.D. Anal. Chem. 1991; 63: 2488-2499Google Scholar) with a high cone voltage of 50 V. The fragmentation from the C-terminal generated a series of product ions at m/z 472.4, 401.4, 273.2, and 144.1 corresponding to the loss of d-Lac, d-Ala-d-Lac, l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Lac, and d-Glu-l-Lys"
https://openalex.org/W4289256797,"In addition to its remarkable supernova signature1,2, the γ-ray burst of 29 March 2003 (GRB030329) had two interesting peculiarities: an unusually low-energy output in γ-rays and a large bump in its afterglow light curve after 1–2 days (followed by several less significant rebrightening episodes). We suggest that refreshed shocks — slow shells ejected from the source that catch up with the afterglow shock a relatively long time after the initial burst — produced the observed fluctuations in the early afterglow light curve and explain the low-energy output at early times."

Cell Physiol. 1996; 168: 648-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pre-IL-1α was shown to stimulate proliferation of smooth muscle cells (11Beasley D. Cooper A.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H901-H912PubMed Google Scholar) and to regulate the migration and the lifespan of endothelial cells (12Maier J.A. Voulalas P. Roeder D. Maciag T. Science. 1990; 249: 1570-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 13McMahon G.A. Garfinkel S. Prudovsky I. Hu X. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28202-28205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, various effects of pre-IL-1α are found to be dependent on the presence of the acidic IL-1NTP fragment with the predicted pI 5.1. Stevenson et al. (14Stevenson F.T. Turck J. Locksley R.M. Lovett D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 508-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) have shown that IL-1NTP overexpressed in mouse 3T3 fibroblasts behaves as a nuclear oncoprotein and induces their transformation (14Stevenson F.T. Turck J. Locksley R.M. Lovett D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 508-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). IL-1NTP was also found to be specifically associated with the novel protein HAX-1 that has been implicated in modulating apoptosis and cytoskeletal functions (15Yin H. Morioka H. Towle C.A. Vidal M. Watanabe T. Weissbach L. Cytokine. 2001; 15: 122-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recently, a strong proapoptotic effect of ectopically expressed IL-1NTP in numerous human tumor cell lines has been reported (16Pollock A.S. Turck J. Lovett D.H. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Taken together, several lines of evidence point to a role of IL-1NTP in certain yet unknown nuclear processes. Initiation of transcription in eukaryotes is mediated by recruitment of different multiprotein complexes to the promoter sequence involving the RNA polymerase II complex, general transcription factors and transcriptional cofactors, histone acetytransferase (HAT) complexes, and sequence-specific transcription factors (17Nakatani Y. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Young B.A. Gruber T.M. Gross C.A. Cell. 2002; 109: 417-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The sequence-specific transcription factors are often composed of separate DNA-binding and activation domains (19Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar, 20Triezenberg S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Depending on the amino acid composition, three types of activation domains are recognized: glutamine-, proline-, and acidic-rich domains. The transcription factors containing the acidic-rich activation domain, such as yeast Gal4p, viral proteins VP16 and E1A, and human c-Jun and NF-κB RelA(p65), are evolutionary well conserved, and are able to activate transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as in mammalian cells (21Kornuc M. Altman R. Harrich D. Garcia J. Chao J. Kayne P. Gaynor R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3717-3725Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 22Baru M. Shlissel M. Manor H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3496-3503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Struhl K. Nature. 1988; 332: 649-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 24Moore P.A. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1666-1674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Moreover, the acidic transcription activators interact with different types of HATs and adaptor proteins, and their overexpression in yeast cells is often associated with growth inhibitory phenotypes (26Kulesza C.A. Van Buskirk H.A. Cole M.D. Reese J.C. Smith M.M. Engel D.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic chromatin structure with DNA wrapped around histone proteins forming a repeating array of nucleosomes leaves promoter DNA sequences inaccessible to the transcriptional machinery (28Paranjape S.M. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 265-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Therefore, the chromatin structure must be remodeled prior to gene targeting (17Nakatani Y. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Up to date, a number of different factors with chromatin remodeling activities have been identified (29Kingston R.E. Bunker C.A. Imbalzano A.N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The fact that histone hyperacetylation is associated with the transcriptionally active chromatin suggests that histone acetylation is one of the chromatin remodeling mechanisms important for transcription initiation (30Turner B.M. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 13-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that HAT activities are intrinsic to the transcriptional coactivators p300/CBP, PCAF, and Gcn5, interacting with a number of sequence-specific transcription factors, confirmed the functional link between histone acetylation and transcriptional control (31Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). However, HATs cannot acetylate histones in the chromatin context per se, they can do so only in context of multiprotein HAT complexes where they interact with adaptor proteins facilitating the accessibility of the histone tails to HAT catalytic domains. Two distinct HAT complexes have been characterized so far in yeast, SAGA and ADA (32Grant P.A. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 33Eberharter A. Sterner D.E. Schieltz D. Hassan A. Yates 3rd, J.R. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6621-6631Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometric analysis has revealed that the human PCAF complex involves, besides transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300 and others, human counterparts of yeast HAT cofactors Ada2, Ada3, and Spt3 (34Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). This mega-dalton complex is composed of more than 14 different subunits that seem to be organized in the three functionally divergent modules responsible: (i) for HAT activity, (ii) for interaction with the sequence-specific transcription factors, and (iii) for association with the preinitiation complex containing TATA-binding protein-associated factors and RNA polymerase II (35Sterner D.E. Grant P.A. Roberts S.M. Duggan L.J. Belotserkovskaya R. Pacella L.A. Winston F. Workman J.L. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 86-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Therefore, the HAT complex represents a physical bridge between distant DNA-bound activators and the transcriptional machinery at the core promoter (36Marmorstein R. Roth S.Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In this study we have investigated functions of the intracellular forms of IL-1α. We have found that when fused to Gal4BD, IL-1NTP acts as an activator of transcription in both yeast and mammalian cells. The transcriptional activation requires an intact SAGA complex in yeast and the transcriptional coactivator p300 in mammalian cells. We also demonstrate that IL-1NTP physically interacts with mammalian histone acetyltransferases Gcn5, PCAF, and p300, and with adaptor protein Ada3 in vitro. In coimmunoprecipitation experiments we show in detail the specific interactions between intracellular forms of IL-1α and different histone acetyltransferases in vivo. Yeast Strains—The yeast strain AH109 (MATa, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, ura3-52, his3-200, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, LYS2::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3, GAL2UAS-GAL2TATA-ADE2, URA3::MEL1UAS-MEL1TATA-lacZ) was from the Matchmaker Two-hybrid System 3 (Clontech). The strains H-224 (MATa, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3, ahc1Δ::LEU2), YMH171 (MATα, ura3–52, leu2-3, 112, his3, trp1Δ) and its isogenic derivatives YMH511 (gcn5Δ::hisG), YMH 535 (ada2Δ::hisG), YMH537 (ada3Δ::hisG), and YMH567 (spt7Δ::LEU2) were kindly provided by M. Hampsey (37Chen B.S. Sun Z.W. Hampsey M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23881-23887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The expression level of Gal4BD fusion proteins was detected using rabbit polyclonal antibody against Gal4BD (sc-729; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Plasmids—Mouse IL-1α/pLXSN construct was a gift from R. Apte (38Douvdevani A. Huleihel M. Zoller M. Segal S. Apte R.N. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 51: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Yeast Gal4BD expression vectors pAS2-1 and pGBKT7, as well as pGBKT7-53 and pGADT7-T constructs were obtained from Clontech. Mammalian Gal4BD expression vector pSG424 was a gift from M. Ptashne (39Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The GST expression plasmid pGEX4T was from Amersham Biosciences. The Gal4BD/VP16-(412–490) yeast expression vector pM1536, and the reporter plasmids pN927 (UASGAL1-TATAGAL1-lacZ (TA/G1Z)), and pN928 (UASGAL1-TGTAGAL1-lacZ (TG/G1Z)) were provided by M. Hampsey (37Chen B.S. Sun Z.W. Hampsey M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23881-23887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding the mouse IL-1α precursor (aa 1–270), IL-1NTP (aa 1–109), as well as its deletion mutants IL-1NTP-ATSSN (internal deletion aa 78–87), IL-1NTP-TSETS (internal deletion aa 57–87), IL-1NTP-DYSSA (terminal deletion aa 1–21), IL-1NTP-FTEDD (terminal deletion aa 97–109), and IL-1NTP-DY/FT (terminal deletions aa 1–21 and 97–109) were amplified from the IL-1α/pLXSN template by PCR and cloned into EcoRI and BamHI sites of pAS2-1, pGBKT7 vectors, or into BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX4T vector, or into BamHI and XbaI sites of the pSG424 vector. Human cDNA encoding the full-length IL-1α protein was amplified from peripheral blood monocytes by reverse transcriptase-PCR and cloned into NcoI and BamHI sites of pGBKT7. This construct was sequenced and used as the template in all the following PCR amplifications of human IL-1NTP, mature IL-1α, and IL-1α precursor proteins for subsequent cloning into EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGBKT7 vector, BamHI and XhoI sites of pGEX4T vector, or into BamHI and XbaI sites of pSG424 vector. All the mouse and human IL-1α protein forms were subcloned into BamHI and XhoI sites of modified pcDNA4/TO/MycHis (Invitrogen) vector with added FLAG tag upstream of the multiple cloning site. The original vector contains Myc and His tags downstream of the cloned cDNA, therefore, all the IL-1α proteins were expressed as double tagged chimeras with N-terminal FLAG and C-terminal Myc and His tags. Fragments encoding human deletion mutants IL-1NTP-VVATN (internal deletion aa 78–87), IL-1NTP-EDSSS (terminal deletion aa 1–19), and IL-1NTP-ITDDD (terminal deletion aa 96–111) were amplified and cloned into BamHI and XhoI sites of modified pcDNA4/TO/MycHis (see above) vector. The E1A and HA-tagged human p300 expression plasmids were from A. Hecht (40Hecht A. Vleminckx K. Stemmler M.P. van Roy F. Kemler R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding HA-tagged human p300 mutants were kindly provided by T. Fujita (41Suhara W. Yoneyama M. Kitabayashi I. Fujita T. J. Biol.

Honjo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17211-17220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and the expression vector encoding HA-tagged human PCAF was kindly supplied by M. Ott (43Dorr A. Kiermer V. Pedal A. Rackwitz H.R. Henklein P. Schubert U. Zhou M.M. Verdin E. Ott M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). R. Brachmann provided us with the vector expressing the N-terminal FLAG-tagged human Ada3 (44Wang T. Kobayashi T. Takimoto R. Denes A.E. Snyder E.L. el-Deiry W.S. Brachmann R.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6404-6413Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), which was also used as a template for amplification and subcloning of Ada3 into pCMV-HA (Clontech) vector expressing HA-tagged human Ada3 protein. All amplifications were done using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and products were verified by direct sequencing. Cell Culture and Luciferase Assay—HEK293 cells from the American Type Culture Collection were grown in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Twenty-four hours before transfection, cells were plated in 24-well plates so that they were 80% confluent the next day. The cells were cotransfected with 0.6 μg of total amount of expression plasmid DNA mixture and pFRLuc Gal4 reporter construct (Stratagene) per well using the Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Empty vectors were used to adjust the amounts of DNA in each experiment. After 48 h cells were harvested and lysates were assayed for luciferase activity using the dual luciferase reporter assay (Promega) and the DLR 96-well plate luminometer (STRATEC Biotechnology Systems AG, Birkenfeld, Germany). Alternatively, the measured luciferase activities were normalized according to total protein concentrations. All experiments were performed in triplicates. Preparation of GST Fusion Proteins and Pull-down Assay—Purifications of recombinant proteins as well as pull-down assays were described previously (45Burysek L. Yeow W.S. Lubyova B. Kellum M. Schafer S.L. Huang Y.Q. Pitha P.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7334-7342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, GST fusion proteins (0.5 μg) bound to glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with 300 μl of whole cell lysates (see next chapter) from HA-tagged p300, PCAF, and Ada3 or FLAG-Gcn5-transfected HEK293 cells in 700 μl of immunoprecipitated (IP) lysis buffer at 4 °C for 4 h. After three washes (10 min at 4 °C) with IP lysis buffer, the proteins bound to the beads were resolved by Tricine-SDS-PAGE (8% gel), transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), and probed with anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma), anti-HA (sc-805), or anti-RelB (sc-226; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. Transient Transfection and Immunoprecipitation—HEK293 cells were transfected in 10-cm Petri dishes using 10 μg of total plasmid DNA as described before. Forty-eight hours later the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in IP lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktails; Sigma) for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation, the supernatants were stored and the sediments containing nuclei and cell debris were extracted with buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures; Sigma) for 15 min on ice. The supernatants from both extractions were mixed. The resulting whole cell extracts were precleared with 50 μl of protein G-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the cleared lysates were incubated with 50 μl of protein G-agarose and 1 μg of anti-FLAG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody in 700 μl of IP lysis buffer overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with IP lysis buffer and subjected to Western blot detection of bound material as described before. β-Galactosidase Assay—Yeast strains harboring UASGAL1-lacZ reporter constructs were grown to late logarithmic phase, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in 200 μl of breaking buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture; Sigma). Cell extracts were prepared by vortexing with 0.5-mm glass beads four times for 30 s. Activities were determined from at least three independent clones using the luminescent β-galactosidase detection kit Galacto-Light (Tropix, Bedford, MA). The measured activities were normalized according to optical densities of the used yeast cultures. The Gal4BD/IL-1NTP Fusion Protein Transactivates the Gal4 Promoter and Confers Growth Inhibition in Yeast—Experiments with the yeast two-hybrid system aiming to identify proteins interacting with IL-1NTP surprisingly revealed that expression of either mouse or human Gal4BD/IL-1NTP fusion protein enabled the growth of the reporter yeast strain on selection drop-out media lacking adenine, histidine and tryptophan (SD-AHT). Fig. 1A shows that the yeast strains expressing the mouse or human Gal4BD/IL-1NTP fusion proteins alone grow by a rate similar to that of the positive control strain expressing the interacting fusion proteins Gal4BD/p53 and Gal4AD/SV40 T large antigen, and when incubated with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-α-gal) substrate, they turn blue (data not shown) indicating the presence of β-galactosidase activity. In contrast, strains expressing only Gal4BD, or mouse or human Gal4BD/IL-1MAT were unable to grow on SD-AHT even after 5 days of cultivation at 30 °C, and even when inoculated at high densities. Thus, in accordance with their high degree of homology, both mouse and human Gal4BD/IL-1NTP chimeras effectively transactivate the GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3, GAL2UAS-GAL2TATA-ADE2, and MEL1UAS-MEL1TATA-lacZ reporters harbored by the AH109 strain. Studies in the eukaryote S. cerevisiae have shown that expression of acidic transactivation proteins fused to Gal4BD can inhibit yeast growth (24Moore P.A. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1666-1674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 27Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). To test the effect of IL-1NTP on yeast growth, and to further investigate the mechanism of IL-1NTP-mediated activation, strain YMH171 and the indicated isogenic derivatives were transformed with the mouse IL-1NTP/pAS2-1 vector expressing higher levels of Gal4BD/IL-1NTP. As shown in Fig. 1B, strain YMH171 (wt) expressing Gal4BD/IL-1NTP grows markedly slower than the strain expressing Gal4BD only (control). However, the Gal4BD/IL-1NTP-induced growth inhibition was strictly dependent on the presence of the intact SAGA transcriptional activation complex. The growth inhibitory effect of IL-1NTP was completely relieved in yeast strains lacking one of the SAGA complex components: Gcn5, Ada2, Ada3, and Spt7. Surprisingly, deletion of the AHC1 gene product, a unique structural subunit of the yeast ADA transcriptional activation complex, did not relieve the Gal4BD/IL-1NTP-mediated growth inhibition. These data suggested specific interference of Gal4BD/IL-1NTP with certain components of the yeast SAGA complex as it has been described for the acidic coactivators Gal4p, E1A, or VP16 (26Kulesza C.A. Van Buskirk H.A. Cole M.D. Reese J.C. Smith M.M. Engel D.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R.

Similar results were obtained when identical yeast strains harboring the UASGAL1-TATAGAL1-lacZ reporter and expressing Gal4BD, mouse Gal4BD/IL-1NTP, or the strong Gal4BD/VP16 activator were assayed for their respective β-galactosidase activities (Fig. 2B). The IL-1NTP-mediated β-galactosidase activities reached about 25% of activities stimulated by Gal4BD/VP16 in wild type strain YMH171 (Fig. 2B, wt). The gcn5Δ, ada2Δ, and ada3Δ deletions severely reduced the activities of both IL-1NTP and VP16, an effect more pronounced for IL-1NTP than for VP16 (5- versus 4-fold reduction, respectively). The most severe reduction (20-fold for both IL-1NTP and VP16) was observed in the strain defective in expression of Spt7, the critical structural subunit of the SAGA complex. In agreement with previous results, ahc1Δ deletion had no impact on activities mediated by both VP16 (37Chen B.S. Sun Z.W. Hampsey M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23881-23887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and IL-1NTP, suggesting that IL-1NTP acts via interaction with the SAGA, but not with the ADA transcriptional complex. Furthermore, the point mutation in the TATA core promoter element (UASGAL1-TGTAGAL1-lacZ) abolished the transactivation potentials of both IL-1NTP and VP16 proteins (Fig. 2A), indicating that the IL-1NTP-mediated activation occurs specifically through a common RNA polymerase II activation mechanism. Characterization of Domains in the IL-1NTP Molecule Responsible for the Transactivation Potential—Besides the well characterized NLS domain (aa 79–86) (7Wessendorf J.H. Garfinkel S. Zhan X. Brown S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22100-22104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our structure-prediction analyses identified two additional highly conserved acidic α-helixes located at the N and C termini of the IL-1NTP molecule (aa 7–19 and 98–108, respectively). In a search for the structural motifs mediating the IL-1NTP transactivation potential, a set of deletion mutants fused to Gal4BD were prepared (Fig. 3A) and tested for their activities in the yeast reporter strain. The yeast strain AH109 was transformed with plasmid constructs encoding different Gal4BD/IL-1NTP deletion mutants. As shown in Fig. 3B, deletion of the NLS domain did not affect the transactivation potential of the Gal4BD/IL-1NTP, whereas deletions of either N- or C-terminal acidic helixes markedly slowed the growth rate. Moreover, the combination of both N- and C-terminal deletions had deteriorating impact on the growth potential on selection media. Analogously, the β-galactosidase activities in the Gal4BD/IL-1NTP expressing AH109 yeast strain were comparable with those in the positive control strain (expressing Gal4BD/p53 and Gal4AD/T-Ag together), and deletions of either one or both terminal helixes in the IL-1NTP molecule dramatically reduced β-galactosidase activities in the respective strains. Interestingly, the internal deletion mutants lacking the NLS domain (ATSSN and TSETS) showed enhanced activities that were as much as 2-fold higher than activities observed in the positive control strain (Fig. 3C). The expression levels of the corresponding Gal4BD fusion proteins in strains tested for growth on drop-out medium (Fig. 3B) and for β-galactosidase activities (Fig. 3C) are shown in Fig. 3D. Lower expression levels of Gal4BD/ATSSN and Gal4BD/TSETS reflect their higher transcriptional activities (Fig. 3C) and higher toxicities (data not shown), and further support the idea about the functional importance of both the IL-1NTP terminal helixes. These data indicate that the NLS domain is not required for the transactivation potential of Gal4BD/IL-1NTP, and that its deletion results even in enhanced transcriptional activity of the chimera. Gal4BD/IL-1NTP Transactivates the Gal4 Promoter in Mammalian Cells via Functional Cooperation and Physical Association with the Transcriptional Coactivator p300 —Our data from the yeast model are consistent with those of other acidic transcriptional coactivators and support our hypothesis about a novel nuclear function of IL-1α. To determine the physiological role of the intracellular IL-1α, we further tested its transactivation potential as well as its ability to cooperate with different histone acetyltransferases in mammalian cells.

Mdm2 functions as an oncoprotein, in part, by acting as a negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Multiple spliced forms of Mdm2 transcripts have been observed in human tumors; however, the contribution of these variant transcripts to tumorigenesis is unknown. In this report, we isolate alternative splice forms of Mdm2 transcripts from sarcomas that spontaneously arise in Mdm2-overexpressing mice, including Mdm2-b, the splice form most commonly observed in human cancers. Transduction of Mdm2-b into a variety of cell types reveals that Mdm2-b promotes p53-independent cell growth, inhibits apoptosis, and up-regulates the RelA subunit of NFκB. Furthermore, expression of Mdm2-b induces tumor formation in transgenic mice. These results identify a p53-independent role for Mdm2 and determine that an alternate spliced form of Mdm2 can contribute to formation of cancer via a p53-independent mechanism.

Mdm2 was initially identified in a screen for genes amplified on double minute chromosomes found in spontaneously transformed BALB/c 3T3 cells (1Cahilly-Snyder L. Yang-Feng T. Francke U. George D.L. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1987; 13: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). When overexpressed, the Mdm2 oncoprotein has been demonstrated to immortalize rodent primary fibroblasts, to increase the rate of cellular proliferation, and to induce cellular transformation (2Finlay C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence has established the Mdm2 oncoprotein as a potent negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. The N terminus of Mdm2 binds the transactivation domain of p53, and Mdm2-p53 complex formation can inhibit p53 modification and p53-mediated transcriptional regulation of heterologous gene expression (3Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar, 4Chen J. Marechal V. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1993; 362: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). In addition, Mdm2 contains a C-terminal zinc RING domain and functions as an E3-ligase to induce p53 ubiquitination and degradation (6Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3722) Google Scholar, 7Kubbatat M. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2847) Google Scholar). The ability of p53 to induce the expression of the Mdm2 gene suggests that Mdm2 and p53 form a negative feedback loop to regulate p53 activity in the cell (8Barak Y. Juven T. Haffner R. Oren M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar, 9Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar). Mdm2-mediated destabilization of p53 is regulated by binding of Mdm2 to the p19 (ARF) tumor suppressor protein and by ATM-induced phosphorylation of Mdm2 and p53 (10.11). The importance of Mdm2 in regulating p53 function has been demonstrated in mice, where the early embryonic-lethal phenotype of Mdm2-null mice is rescued by deletion of functional p53 (12Jones S.N. Roe A.E. Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Nature. 1995; 378: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar, 13Montes de Oca Luna R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Mice deficient for both Mdm2 and p53 undergo normal development, are viable, and are fertile, suggesting that any functions possessed by Mdm2 aside from its ability to regulate p53 are dispensable for normal cell growth and development. The human MDM2 gene is amplified to high copy numbers in approximately one-third of all human sarcomas (14Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Meltzer P.S. George D.L. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1992; 358: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1802) Google Scholar), and is overexpressed in a wide range of human cancers (15Reifenberger G. Liu L. Ichimura K. Schmidt E.E. Collins V.P. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2736-2739PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bueso-Ramos C.E. Yang Y. deLeon E. McCown P. Stass S.A. Albitar M. Blood. 1993; 82: 2617-2623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As many of these tumors retain a wild-type p53 gene, it is presumed that overexpression of Mdm2 serves to inactivate p53 function in these tumors. However, tumors have been identified that have both Mdm2 amplification and p53 loss; a seemingly redundant set of mutations (17Cordon-Cardo C. Latres E. Drobnjak M. Oliva M.R. Pollack D. Woodruff J.M. Marechal V. Chen J. Brennan M.F. Levine A.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 794-799PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, these rare sarcomas are much more aggressive than those tumors with alterations in only Mdm2 or p53, suggesting that there may exist a p53-independent role for Mdm2 when overexpressed in these tumors. Several additional lines of evidence suggest that Mdm2 may regulate growth not only by inhibiting p53 function, but through p53-independent mechanisms as well. Human MDM2 has been reported to form a complex with the major (p110) Rb 1The abbreviations used are: RbretinoblastomaGFAPglial fibrillary acidic proteinMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastsFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterFITCfluorescein isothiocyanatePBSphosphate-buffered salineDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleTNFtumor necrosis factor. tumor suppressor protein and with E2F1 and DP1 transcription factors (18Xiao Z.X.

Other cell cycle regulatory proteins that bind with Mdm2 include Numb, MTBP, SMAD transcription factors, TIP60, and β-arrestin; a β2-adrenergic receptor regulator (20Juven-Gershon T.

Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence for a p53-independent role for Mdm2 in cell growth has been provided through analysis of transgenic mice. Overexpression of MDM2 cDNA in the mammary epithelium of transgenic mice was found to inhibit development of the mammary gland by inducing multiple rounds of S phase without completion of mitosis (25Lundgren K. Montes de Oca Luna R. McNeill Y.B. Emerick E.P. Spencer B. Barfield C.R. Lozano G. Rosenberg M.P. Finlay C.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 714-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The uncoupling of S phase from mitosis was seen in transgenic mice, which were either wild type or deficient for p53, indicating a p53-independent role for Mdm2 in the regulation of DNA synthesis. We have also provided genetic evidence for a p53-independent role for Mdm2 in sarcoma formation. Transgenic mice were generated using mouse genomic DNA encoding the entire Mdm2 gene under control of its native promoter region. These mice displayed a 4-fold increase in the level of Mdm2 expression and were found to have increased predisposition to spontaneous sarcoma formation regardless of the p53 status of the mice (26Jones S.N.

Analysis of a variety of human tumors that overexpress Mdm2 has revealed the presence of multiple, alternatively spliced forms of Mdm2 message (27Bartel F. Meye A. Wurl P. Kappler M. Bache M. Lautenschrunlager C. Grunbaum U. Schmidt H. Taubert H. Int. J. Cancer (Pred. Oncol.). 2001; 95: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In some cases, the presence of these spliced Mdm2 forms has been correlated with a more aggressive disease state (28Matsumoto R. Tada M. Nozaki M. Zhang C.L. Sawamura Y. Abe H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 609-613PubMed Google Scholar, 29Bartel F. Pinkert D. Fiedler W. Kappler M. Wurl P. Schmidt H. Taubert H. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 9-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some of these transcripts encode Mdm2 proteins that lack the p53-binding domain and are incapable of complexing with p53, yet can induce foci formation in 3T3 cells in culture, suggesting that these tumor-isolated Mdm2 isoforms may contribute to transformation in a p53-independent manner (30Sigalas I. Calvert A.H. Anderson J.J. Neal D.E. Lunec J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 912-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). More recently, several groups have characterized several spliced isoforms of Mdm2 transcripts isolated from mouse or human tumors and have reported that many of these isoforms appear to inhibit cell proliferation, though the precise mechanism of growth inhibition remains unclear (31Dang J. Kuo M.L. Eischen C.M. Stepanova L. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1222-1230PubMed Google Scholar, 32Evans S.C. Viswanathan M Grier J.D. Narayana M. El-Naggar A.K. Lozano G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4041-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In order to assess the potential role of Mdm2 isoforms in tumorigenesis, we have analyzed sarcomas isolated from our Mdm2-transgenic mice. We have detected numerous spliced isoforms of Mdm2 transcripts in the tumors, including the murine equivalent of the B isoform; the most prevalent isoform observed in human cancers. Hdm2-B has been previously detected in high grade bladder and uterine cancers, lacks the p53-binding region present in full-length Mdm2, and was found to be incapable of complexing with the p53 protein (30Sigalas I. Calvert A.H. Anderson J.J. Neal D.E. Lunec J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 912-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In this report, we examine the functional significance of the Mdm2-b form in cells and in mice. Our results indicate that this Mdm2 isoform encodes a variant Mdm2 protein that lacks the p53-binding domain and contains only the C-terminal RING domain. This Mdm2 protein is found to induce cell proliferation and to interfere with apoptosis in a p53-independent manner in cultured cells, and induce spontaneous tumorigenesis in transgenic mice. Interestingly, expression of either Mdm2 or Mdm2-b increases the level of the RelA (p65) protein in cells, and Mdm2-b can increase NFκB-dependent transcription in transduced cells and potentiate the response of these cells to TNF-mediated apoptosis. These results identify a p53-independent role for Mdm2 in modulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, demonstrate that a splice isoform of Mdm2 can induce tumor formation in vivo, and further suggest that the presence of this splice isoform of Mdm2 contributes to the neoplasia induced by Mdm2 overexpression in human cancers. Isolation of Alternatively Spliced Mdm2 Transcripts—Total RNA was isolated from dounce homogenized, snap frozen transgenic tumor tissue using TRIzol (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed using Superscript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). RNA was reverse-transcribed using an oligo(dT) primer. The resulting cDNA was used in nested PCR utilizing primer pair Ex2forward (5′-CTGCTGGGCGAGCGGGAGACC-3′) and Ex12reverse (5′-GTGGACTAAGACAGTTTTCTGGC-3′) for the first amplification of 25 cycles followed by a second amplification with primer pair Ex2nest (5′-GACCCTCTCGGATCACCGCGC-3′) and Ex12nest (5′-GTGAGCAGGTCAGCTAGTTGA- 3′) for a total of 35 cycles of 94 °C for 2 min, 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. PCR products were resolved on 1% agarose gels, excised, purified (GENECLEAN), and cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega) for sequencing. PCR identification of specific Mdm2-b isoform was done using primer pair MBforward (5′-AAGAGACTCTGGACTATTGGAAGTG-3′) and 12reverse (5′-GCAGATCACACATGGTTCGATGGCA-3′). DNA sequencing of cDNAs was performed by the University of Massachusetts Nucleic Acid Facility to identify Mdm2-specific isoforms. Cloning and Expression of the Mdm2-b Isoform—Mdm2-b and Hdm2-B cDNAs were cloned into the EcoRI sites of pBabe-PURO and pcDNA3.1HisC expression plasmids (Invitrogen). Mdm2-b protein product was confirmed using an in vitro transcription and translation system in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega). Cell Culture, Cell Lines, and Antibodies—NIH3T3 cells were purchased from the ATCC. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) null for pRB or p53 were generated using standard protocols. p19(ARF)-null MEFs were kindly provided by the Kowalik laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, (100 units/ml) of penicillin and (100 μg/ml) of streptomycin. Stable cell lines were passaged in media containing (3 μg/ml) puromycin (Sigma). Stable transfection of NIH3T3 cells were performed in 100-mm plates using 10 μg of linearized expression plasmid DNA along with FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Following puromycin drug selection, surviving colonies were pooled for the generation of stable cell lines. For immunolocalization studies, 2 × 105 cells were seeded onto coverslips in the bottom of 6-well plates. Transient transfections were performed using 1 μg of Express-Mdm2-b, Express-AML3, or Express-empty vector using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Foci formation was scored in NIH3T3 stable cell lines following methanol fixation and 0.1% crystal violet after 2 weeks of culture. Bosc293 cells at 80% confluency were transfected with 10 μgs of pBabe-Mdm2-b, pBabe-Hdm2-B, pBabe-Mdm2-bssp1, or pBabe control using LipofectAMINE to generate recombinant retrovirus. Forty-eight hours following transfection, retroviral particles were collected and used for the viral transduction of primary MEFs or NIH3T3 cells seeded at 1 × 106 cells per 100-mm plate. Polyclonal antibodies against p65 (C-20) and against the C terminus of Mdm2 (C-18) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Primary polyclonal antibody Ab-7 (Oncogene Research Products) was used to detect p53, followed by secondary biotin-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep IgG (Oncogene Research Products) and tertiary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Strepavidin (Zymed Laboratories Inc. Anti-Xpress-FITC antibody (Invitrogen) was used for immunolocalization studies. An anti-BrdUrd antibody (BD Biosciences) was used to label cells for FACS analysis. Anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was used for protein loading control. Analysis of Cell Proliferation—Growth curves were performed with triplicate plating of either NIH3T3 stable cell lines, p53-/-, p19-/-, or pRB-/- PuroR early passage MEFs. Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells per 60-mm plate and counted every 24 h using a Beckman Coulter Counter. For the determination of asynchronous S phase populations, cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells per 100-mm plate and pulsed 24 h later with 10 μm BrdUrd for 1 h. FACS analysis was performed on cells stained for BrdUrd and propidium iodide. Analysis of Cell Death—NIH3T3 cell lines were 50-60% confluent when treated with (500 ng/ml) doxorubicin (Sigma). Triplicate samples of cells were harvested 24-36 h later and analyzed for propidium iodide uptake by FACS analysis. NFκB Activity Assays—293T cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells in 2 mls of medium and transfected with 50 ng of each of an internal β-galactosidase transfection efficiency control plasmid and either a κB-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid containing two canonical κB sites or a control plasmid lacking κB sites together with Mdm2-b or control pcDNA3.1 expression plasmids. Cells were treated with recombinant TNF-α (Roche Applied Science) and 24-36 h following transfection, luciferase assays (Promega) were performed using a luminometer as previously described (33Duckett C.S. Gedrich R.W. Gilfillan M.C. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunolocalization Assays—Forty-eight hours following transient transfection, cells on coverslips were fixed with (3.7%) formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with (0.25%) Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked in 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS prior to a 1-h incubation with an anti-Xpress-FITC-conjugated antibody for the recognition of Mdm2-b or AML3. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (0.5 μg DAPI in 0.1% Triton X-100-PBSA). Cells were visualized using a Zeiss Confocal Microscope. Generation of Transgenic Mice—Mdm2-b cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI sites of transgene cassettes pCAGGs and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Transgenic mice were generated via pronuclear injection using standard procedures. Identification of GFAP-Mdm2-b founder mice and transmission of the transgene was determined by PCR and Southern analyses. The PCR primers used for genotyping span the junction of cDNA to MP-1pA, Tgforward 5′-CCAATCCAAATGATTGTGCTA-3′ and TGreverse 5′-CATTGTTCCTTAGCAGGCTCC-3′. Southern analysis was performed on EcoRI-digested genomic tail DNA using Mdm2-b cDNA as a probe, and densitometry using a phosphorimager identified the relative copy number of transgenes in each line. Isolation and Characterization of Mdm2-b—To determine whether Mdm2 splice variant transcripts are present in our Mdm2 transgenic mouse tumors, RNA was extracted from 14 frozen tumor samples, and RT-PCR was performed using nested PCR amplification. PCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1A), and Southern hybridization using various Mdm2 oligonucleotide probes spanning the Mdm2 coding sequences. The majority of spliced variants hybridized to 3′-probes corresponding to exon 12 of the Mdm2 gene (data not shown). In order to isolate individual spliced variants, nested Mdm2 PCR products were purified and 72 transcripts were subcloned into plasmid vectors. Subsequent DNA sequencing of the cDNA clones revealed a wide range of Mdm2 spliced variants and included both aberrant transcripts resulting from cryptic splice sites within introns and exons as well as transcripts generated from the donor and acceptor splice sites located at the Mdm2 intron-exon boundaries (28Matsumoto R. Tada M. Nozaki M. Zhang C.L. Sawamura Y. Abe H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 609-613PubMed Google Scholar). The most prevalent transcript observed is identical to Hdm2-B, the most frequently detected Mdm2 spliced variant found in human tumors (29Bartel F. Pinkert D. Fiedler W. Kappler M. Wurl P. Schmidt H. Taubert H. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 9-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 30Sigalas I. Calvert A.H. Anderson J.J. Neal D.E. Lunec J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 912-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). This mouse Mdm2-b isoform was detected in all 14 analyzed tumor samples and was not detected in wild-type tissue in these experiments (Fig. 1B). The Mdm2-b transcript encodes for sequences present in Mdm2 exons 2-3 and exon 12, with RNA splicing between exons 3 and 12 occurring at the precise exon splice donor-acceptor motifs. The predicted protein alignment between Mdm2-b and Hdm2-B is illustrated (Fig. 1C). Amino acid identity between the two proteins is 82%. The encoded Mdm2-b protein lacks the p53-binding, p300-binding, pRb-binding, and p19(ARF) binding domains present on full-length Mdm2, as well as the Mdm2 nuclear localization and nuclear export signals. Mdm2-b does contain the complete C-terminal zinc finger, Ring finger domain, and Mdm2 residues that have been identified as targets for phosphorylation by ATM (11Maya R. Balass M. Kim S.T. Shkedy D.

Haupt Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8371-8374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To confirm that the Mdm2-b spliced transcript encodes for a protein product, Mdm2-b cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1 in frame with an N-terminal Xpress epitope tag (Invitrogen) and expressed the protein in an in vitro transcription/translation expression system (Promega). The Mdm2-b transcript encodes a protein product of ∼47 kDa in size, when the size of the 3.5-kDa Xpress tag is subtracted (Fig. 1D). To determine the cellular location of the Mdm2-b protein, the pcDNA-XpressMdm2-b vector was transiently transfected into NIH3T3 cells and immunofluorescence microscopy was performed using an α-XPRESS-FITC-conjugated antibody against XPRESS-Mdm2-b. Mdm2-b was determined to localize predominantly in the cytoplasm of the transfected NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1E), in keeping with the absence of a nuclear localization signal on Mdm2-b. An XPRESS tagged-AML3 expression plasmid that encodes a protein that localizes to the nucleus was used in parallel as a control in this experiment. Expression of Mdm2-b Increases Cell Proliferation and Transformation—Numerous spliced forms of Mdm2, including the b isoform, have been identified previously in human tumors (30Sigalas I. Calvert A.H. Anderson J.J. Neal D.E. Lunec J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 912-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 32Evans S.C. Viswanathan M Grier J.D. Narayana M. El-Naggar A.K. Lozano G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4041-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, there have been contradictory reports as to the effect of the splice forms upon cell growth (30Sigalas I. Calvert A.H. Anderson J.J. Neal D.E. Lunec J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 912-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 31Dang J. Kuo M.L. Eischen C.M. Stepanova L. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4041-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to examine if the presence of the Mdm2-b isoform might contribute to the malignant phenotype of our Mdm2 transgenic mice. Hdm2-B and Mdm2-b cDNAs were cloned separately into the pBabe retroviral expression vector and stably transduced into NIH3T3 cells to examine if Hdm2-B or Mdm2-b is capable of altering cellular growth characteristics. Selection for puromycin-resistant clones indicated a transduction frequency of ∼90%. Following drug selection, the stable transfectants were pooled and the expression of spliced variants was confirmed with RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis (data not shown). Transduction of Mdm2-b into NIH3T3 cells was found to promote obvious rapid cell proliferation. BrdU staining of asynchronous growing cells transduced with Mdm2-b or with control (pBABE-empty vector) revealed an increase in the numbers of Mdm2-b-transduced cells present in S phase of the cell cycle relative to control transduced cells (Fig. 2A). To confirm the positive effects of the B splice form on cell growth, cell proliferation assays were performed using triplicate plates of NIH3T3 cells transduced with Hdm2-B, Mdm2-b, or empty vector (pBABE) (Fig. 2B). Three repeat experiments confirmed that the presence of either Hdm2-B or Mdm2-b increased the proliferation rate and saturation density of NIH3T3 cells. To determine whether Mdm2-b could contribute to cellular transformation, Mdm2-b NIH3T3 cells and control pBabe NIH3T3 cells were seeded onto 60-mm dishes and maintained in culture for 2 weeks. Following crystal violet staining, foci formation was scored from six representative plates of each cell line (Fig. 2C). Mdm2-b expression induced larger and more numerous foci in the monolayer (44.6 ± 4.5 foci per plate) than did transduction with pBabe alone (18.2 ± 5.7 foci per plate). Thus, expression of Mdm2-b in NIH3T3 cells accelerates the rate of cell proliferation and interferes with growth suppression induced by contact inhibition. Mdm2-b Increases Cell Proliferation Independent of p53, p19 (ARF), and Rb—Unlike full-length Mdm2, Mdm2-b lacks the p53 binding domain of Mdm2, and Hdm2-B has been previously demonstrated to be incapable of complexing with p53 (30Sigalas I. Calvert A.H. Anderson J.J. Neal D.E. Lunec J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 912-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, it remains possible that Mdm2-b still alters p53 functions, possibly by complexing with full-length Mdm2 (32Evans S.C. Viswanathan M Grier J.D. Narayana M. El-Naggar A.K. Lozano G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4041-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To determine if Mdm2-b functions through p53 to increase cell proliferation, recombinant retroviruses were used to transduce early passage, primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from p53-null mice. Transient selection of the MEFs in puromycin indicated a 95% transduction frequency. The pooled MEFs were triplicate plated in 60-mm dishes, and growth rates were monitored for each cell type over a period of 5 days in culture. Results of the growth curves clearly demonstrate the ability of both Hdm2-B and Mdm2-b to increase the rate of cellular proliferation when p53 is absent (Fig. 2D). In addition to the p53-binding region, Mdm2-b lacks both p19ARF and pRb binding domains. In order to determine the proliferative effect this spliced variant has on cells lacking either p19ARF or pRb, we infected early passage p19ARF-null MEFs or Rb-null MEFs with Hdm2-B or pBabe-control retrovirus, pooled those cells surviving drug selection, and used resulting cells for proliferation curves. Similar to results obtained with p53-null cells, Hdm2-B accelerates growth in the absence of either p19(ARF) or pRb (Fig. 2E). These data indicates that the b form does not depend upon the presence of p53, p19, or Rb to increase the rate of cell growth. Expression of Mdm2-b Interferes with Apoptosis—To determine if Mdm2-b is interfering with p53-mediated apoptosis, we examined the levels of p53 in the transduced 3T3 cells following treatment with the topoisomerase inhibitor, doxorubicin. Doxorubicin is an anthracycline analogue reported to induce apoptosis through p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms (37Gerwirtz D.A. Biochem.

Although p53 protein levels are elevated in the control-transduced cells, Mdm2-b-transduced cells, and in the Hdm2-B-transduced cells 18 h after doxorubicin treatment, no reduction was observed in p53 protein levels in cells transduced with the b isoforms relative to the control cells, indicating that Mdm2-b or Hdm2-B does not alter p53 levels in these cells (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the presence of Mdm2-b in 3T3 cells does not inhibit p53-mediated induction of genes such as p21 (Waf/Cip) following treatment with 8Gy ionizing radiation (IR) and Mdm2-b-transduced cells undergo a G1 arrest in response to IR (data not shown). These data suggest that the Mdm2-b splice variant does not alter p53 stability or activity. Another potent regulator of apoptosis is the NFκB transcription factor, a dimeric complex composed of the transcriptionally inactive p50 subunit and the p65 (RelA) subunit, which contains a potent transactivation domain (38Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The activity of NFκB is suppressed by interaction with IκB proteins that sequester NFκB in the cytoplasm (39Malek S. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2071857408,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a causative agent of gastrointestinal diseases such as atrophic gastritis and gastroduodenal ulcer. Infection of cagA-positive H. pylori is also associated with gastric carcinoma and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. The cagA gene product CagA is directly injected into the bacteria-attached host cells via the bacterial type IV secretion system. The translocated CagA deregulates intracellular signaling pathways and thereby initiates pathogenesis. In this work, we examined the biological effects of CagA on B cells, from which MALT lymphoma arises. Ectopic expression of CagA in interleukin 3-dependent B cells inhibited cell proliferation by suppressing the JAK-STAT signaling. CagA was also capable of preventing hydroxyurea-induced B-cell apoptosis through inhibiting p53 accumulation. In contrast to the effects of CagA in gastric epithelial cells, the observed CagA activities in B cells were independent of its tyrosine phosphorylation. Our results indicate that CagA possesses both phosphorylation-dependent and -independent activities in mammalian cells and that biological impacts of CagA depend on cell-type context. As a result of B-cell growth inhibition, CagA may diminish anti-H. pylori immune responses. Furthermore, CagA may play a role in the development of MALT lymphoma by impairing p53-dependent apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1977257516,"14-3-3 proteins are abundant binding proteins involved in many biologically important processes. 14-3-3 proteins bind to other proteins in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and function as scaffold molecules modulating the activity of their binding partners. In this work, we studied the conformational changes of 14-3-3 C-terminal stretch, a region implicated in playing a role in the regulation of 14-3-3. Time-resolved fluorescence and molecular dynamics were used to investigate structural changes of the C-terminal stretch induced by phosphopeptide binding and phosphorylation at Thr232, a casein kinase I phosphorylation site located within this region. A tryptophan residue placed at position 242 was exploited as an intrinsic fluorescence probe of the C-terminal stretch dynamics. Other tryptophan residues were mutated to phenylalanine. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements revealed that phosphopeptide binding changes the conformation and increases the flexibility of 14-3-3ζ C-terminal stretch, demonstrating that this region is directly involved in ligand binding. Phosphorylation of 14-3-3ζ at Thr232 resulted in inhibition of phosphopeptide binding and suppression of 14-3-3-mediated enhancement of serotonin N-acetyltransferase activity. Time-resolved fluorescence of Trp242 also revealed that phosphorylation at Thr232 induces significant changes of the C-terminal stretch conformation. In addition, molecular dynamic simulations suggest that phosphorylation at Thr232 induces a more extended conformation of 14-3-3ζ C-terminal stretch and changes its interaction with the rest of the 14-3-3 molecule.

Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 proteins were the first signaling molecules to be described as distinct Ser(P)/Thr(P)-binding proteins (2Muslin A.J.

Over 100 distinct ligands have been found to interact with 14-3-3, including proteins playing critical roles in the cell cycle regulation, initiation of apoptosis, regulation of neurotransmitter synthesis, or control of gene transcription (1Fu H.

Despite substantial diversity of known binding partners, in many cases the precise function of 14-3-3 binding remains obscure.

For example, in mammals seven isoforms have been identified to date. The presence of multiple 14-3-3 isoforms over the wide range of species suggests that individual isoforms can interact with different targets. Maximal isoform sequence variability occurs within the C-terminal stretch, a region that is believed to be flexible. The structure of this part of 14-3-3 molecule is unknown because it cannot be seen in any of the available 14-3-3 x-ray structures presumably due to disorder (4Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S.

It has been suggested that 14-3-3ζ C-terminal stretch might interact with the cluster of basic residues at the top of the ligand binding groove (6Liu D. Bienkowska J. Petosa C. Collier R.J. Fu H. Liddington R. Nature. 1995; 376: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Truong et al. (13Truong A.B. Masters S.C. Yang H. Fu H. Proteins. 2002; 49: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) reported that C-terminally truncated 14-3-3ζ exhibits increased binding to several tested ligands. They also suggested that the C terminus can function as a suppressor of unspecific interactions between 14-3-3 and inappropriate ligands. Moreover C-terminal stretch of vertebrate 14-3-3ζ and -τ isoforms contains a phosphorylation site at position 232, which is known to be phosphorylated both in vitro and in vivo by casein kinase Iα (15Dubois T. Rommel C. Howell S. Steinhussen U. Soneji Y. Morrice N. Moelling K. Aitken A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28882-28888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that phosphorylation could be an important factor affecting properties of individual 14-3-3 isoforms. Dubois et al. (15Dubois T. Rommel C. Howell S. Steinhussen U. Soneji Y. Morrice N. Moelling K. Aitken A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28882-28888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) showed that in human embryonic kidney 293 cells 14-3-3ζ is phosphorylated exclusively at Thr232. Since in these cells only non-phosphorylated 14-3-3ζ is bound to Raf-1 kinase (16Rommel C. Radziwill G. Lovric J. Noeldeke J. Heinicke T. Jones D. Aitken A. Moelling K. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 609-619PubMed Google Scholar), it has been concluded that in vivo phosphorylation at Thr232 inhibits interaction between 14-3-3ζ and Raf-1 kinase. Although the participation of the C terminus and phosphorylation at Thr232 in the regulation of 14-3-3 function has been established, the precise mechanism of these processes is less clear. To extend our understanding of the role of C-terminal stretch in the regulation of 14-3-3, we have investigated the effect of phosphopeptide binding and phosphorylation at Thr232 on 14-3-3ζ C-terminal stretch conformation using time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular dynamic simulations. We show that 14-3-3ζ C-terminal stretch is directly involved in 14-3-3-ligand interaction because phosphopeptide binding changes the conformation of 14-3-3ζ C-terminal stretch and increases its mobility. In addition, our data indicate a conformational change induced by phosphorylation at Thr232, which is presumably responsible for the observed phosphorylation-induced inhibition effects. Expression, Purification, and Phosphorylation of 14-3-3—All mutants of 14-3-3ζ were generated using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The 14-3-3ζ was expressed and purified as described previously (8Obsil T. Ghirlando R. Klein D.C. Ganguly S. Dyda F. Cell. 2001; 105: 257-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Purified 14-3-3ζ in buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% (w/v) glycerol was phosphorylated by incubation (3 h at 30 °C) with 4 μg of active casein kinase Iα (Upstate Biotechnology)/mg of protein in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm ATP (15Dubois T.

Samples were first separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. Protein bands corresponding to phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated proteins were excised from the gel and digested by trypsin directly in the gel (17Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar). Resulting peptide mixtures were extracted by 30% acetonitrile and 0.5% acetic acid and subjected to a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer Bruker BIFLEX (Bruker-Daltonics) equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm) and a delayed extraction ion source. Negative ion mass spectra of peptide maps were measured in the reflection mode. From the comparison of MALDI-TOF mass spectra of both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated samples, it is clear that the peak having the mass of 2487.0 (m/z) occurs only in the phosphorylated 14-3-3ζ (data not shown). This peak corresponds to the phosphorylated C-terminal peptide DNLTLWTSDTQGDEAEAGEGGEN from positions 223–245 of a 14-3-3ζ primary structure containing motif TSDTQGDE where the underlined residue is Thr232, known to be phosphorylated both in vitro and in vivo by casein kinase I (15Dubois T.

Ganguly S. Dyda F. Cell. 2001; 105: 257-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The progress of phosphorylation was checked by native isoelectric focusing. Enzyme Activity Measurements—The activity of pAANAT-(1–201) was measured as described previously (8Obsil T. Ghirlando R. Klein D.C. Ganguly S. Dyda F.

The assay was performed at 30 °C in buffer containing 50 mm sodium citrate (pH 6.8), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 μm acetyl-CoA, 20 μm tryptamine, and 300 nm 14-3-3. The reaction was started by addition of pAANAT (final concentration, 30 nm). Fluorescence Anisotropy Binding Assay—Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were performed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS5 spectrofluorometer. Synthetic peptides LSQRQRSTSTPNVHMV (Raf-259) or LSQRQRSTpSTPNVHMV (pRaf-259), where pS denotes phosphoserine, with a fluorescein attached to the N terminus (PolyPeptide Laboratories, Prague, Czech Republic) were dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer to a final concentration of 500 nm. Increasing amounts of 14-3-3 were then titrated into the cuvette. At each 14-3-3 concentration, the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy of fluorescein was measured (excitation at 490 nm, and emission at 520 nm). Anisotropy was calculated from the fluorescence intensities according to the relationship A = (III - I⊥)/(III + 2I⊥). The fraction of peptide bound (fB) was calculated using Equation 1,fB=(Aobs-Amin)/[(Amax-Aobs)Q+(Aobs-Amin)](Eq. 1) where Q represents the quantum yield ratio of the bound to the free form and was estimated by the ratio of the intensities of the bound to the free fluorophore. Aobs is the observed anisotropy for any 14-3-3 concentration, Amax is the anisotropy at saturation, and Amin is the minimum observed anisotropy (19Harper C.C. Berg J.M. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7897-7901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The fraction of peptide bound was plotted versus the 14-3-3 concentration, and the data were fit to Equation 2 (20Kohler J.J. Schepartz A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 130-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) to determine the KD for peptide·14-3-3 complex formation,fB={1/(2[Pep])}{KD+[Pep]+[14-3-3]-(kD+[Pep]+[14-3-3])2-4[Pep][14-3-3]}(Eq. 2) where KD is the equilibrium dissociation constant. Each titration was repeated three times. Non-linear data fitting was performed using the Origin 6.0 package (Microcal Software Inc.). Steady-state Fluorescence Spectra Measurements—Steady-state fluorescence emission spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS5 spectrofluorometer. All 14-3-3 spectra were measured in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer at 22 °C. 14-3-3 concentration was 15 μm. Spectra were measured by excitation at 290 nm (5-nm slit width), and the fluorescence emission was measured from 310 to 430 nm (10-nm slit width). Peptide (pRaf-259 or Raf-259) concentration was 17 μm. Time-resolved Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence decays and anisotropies were measured on an apparatus comprised of a laser excitation source and a time-correlated single photon counting detection with a cooled microchannel plate photomultiplier (Hamamatsu, R3809U-50). The cavity-dumped dye laser (Spectra Physics, model 375) served as an excitation source. Picosecond pulses were generated at 596 nm, doubled to 298 nm, and used for excitation of samples. Fluorescence was collected through a monochromator at 360 nm with a slit width of 15 nm. A supplemental color glass filter (Zeiss, UG1) was placed in front of the input slit to enhance suppression of scattered light. The time scale was 36.5 and 7.3 ps/channel for measurements of fluorescence lifetimes and anisotropies, respectively. Typically 1024 channels/decay were used, and data were accumulated until 107 counts/decay were reached. Fluorescence was acquired under “magic angle” conditions when the measured intensity decay I(t) is independent of a rotational diffusion of the chromophore and provides unbiased information about lifetimes. The polarized components III(t) and I⊥(t) were accumulated quasisimultaneously with a switching frequency of 30 s. The polarized decays were measured with the emission polarizer set in the fixed vertical position, and the excitation polarization plane was rotated 0° and 90°, respectively. This approach minimized the need to correct transmittances of the detection channel for different polarizations since the g-factor was close to 1. The value of the g-factor was determined by an independent experiment. The apparatus response function was reconstructed from a fluorescence decay of a pair of reference compounds as described by Vecer et al. (21Vecer J. Kowalczyk A.A. Davenport L. Dale R.E. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1993; 64: 3413-3424Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Samples were placed in a thermostatic holder and measured at 22 °C in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). 14-3-3 concentration was 20 μm, and ligand (pRaf-259 or Raf-259 peptide) concentration was 50 μm. Fluorescence Data Processing—Fluorescence has been assumed to decay multiexponentially according to a formula,I(t)=∑iαi·e-t/τi(Eq. 3) where τi are the lifetimes and αi are the corresponding amplitudes. The I(t) was analyzed by a maximum entropy method (SVD-MEM) coded according to Bryan (22Bryan R.K. Eur. Biophys. J. 1990; 18: 165-174Crossref Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The program yields a set of amplitudes αi that represents a lifetime distribution in the decay. We have chosen 150 lifetimes covering the range from 20 ps to 20 ns. The lifetimes were equidistantly spaced in the logarithmic scale. Not having prior information about number of lifetime classes (peaks) in the lifetime distribution and about the distribution shape, the data analysis started from the flat initial guess where all lifetimes have the same prior probability. The mean lifetime was calculated asτmean=∑ifiτi(Eq. 4) where fi is an intensity fraction of the ith lifetime componentfi=αiτi∑iαiτi(Eq. 5) The anisotropy decay r(t) was obtained from the parallel III(t) and perpendicular I⊥(t) decay components by running the MEM program PULSE5QT (MaxEnt Solutions, Ltd., Cambridge, UK) (Ref. 23Brochon J.C. Fluorescence Anisotropy Decay Analysis by Quantified Maximum Entropy Method, User Manual for PULSE5QT Program. MaxEnt Solutions, Ltd., Cambridge, UK1999: 33Google Scholar; for a review, see Ref. 24Brochon J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 262-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). During the anisotropy analysis the intensity decay I(t) was calculated by summing the parallel and twice the perpendicular components: I(t) = III(t) + 2I⊥(t). The anisotropy was fitted for a distribution of the correlation times without prior setting of limits on the shape of the distribution. We used 150 correlation times ϕi spanning an interval of 5 ps–10 ns equidistantly spaced in the logarithmic scale. To account for a rotation of the whole protein, a single discrete correlation time ϕg has been introduced to the anisotropy decay schemer(t)=∑iβi·e-t/ϕi+βg·e-t/ϕg(Eq. 6) where∑iβi+βg=r0(Eq. 7) The r0 is an initial anisotropy, and βi are amplitudes associated with the ith rotational correlation time and forming distribution of ϕi. The ϕg was determined in a separate experiment with the time scaling of 36.5 ps/channel to record full emission decay of the protein. The anisotropy was fitted by a conventional least-squares method to obtain the value of ϕg. Later the value of ϕg was input as a discrete correlation time to the MEM software and was kept fixed during the analysis. The mean correlation time associated with fast chromophore movements, i.e. excluding the overall rotation of the protein was calculated from the formulaϕmean=∑i(βi-βg)·ϕi∑i(βi-βg)(Eq. 8) Molecular Dynamic Simulations—The GROMACS Version 3.1 package was used with the parameter set ffG43a1p (25Hansson T.

To create 14-3-3ζ phosphorylated at Thr232, the Thr232 was replaced by a phosphothreonine (Thr(P)) residue. The starting structures were energy-minimized using the steepest descent method. Proteins were then solvated with water in a dodecahedral periodic box using the simple point charge water model (26Berendsen H.J.C. Grigera J.R. Straatsma T.P. J. Phys. Chem. 1987; 18: 6269-6271Crossref Scopus (9957) Google Scholar). All water molecules within 1.5 Å of any protein atom were removed. The systems were electroneutralized by replacing water molecules with the highest electrostatic potential energy with Na+ ions. Next the resulting systems were energy-minimized for 700 steps. This was followed by a 50-ps equilibration MD run during which position restraints were applied on the protein. The systems were then set completely free, and 200-ps-long MD simulations at 300 K temperature and 1 bar pressure were used to estimate the box sizes for subsequent 3-ns-long production runs at constant volume. All simulations were run with a 2-fs time step. Solute, solvent, and counter-ions were independently weakly coupled to a reference temperature bath (27Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. Van Gunsteren W.F. Di Nola A. Haak J.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684Crossref Scopus (22550) Google Scholar) with a coupling constant of τT = 0.1 ps. The initial velocities were obtained from a Maxwellian distribution at the desired temperature. The pressure was controlled using the Berendsen algorithm with a coupling constant of τP = 0.5 ps. All bond lengths were constrained using LINCS (28Hess B. Bekker H. Berendsen H.J.C. Fraaije J.G.E.M. J. Comp. Chem. 1997; 18: 1463-1472Crossref Scopus (10848) Google Scholar). The particle mesh Ewald method was used to treat electrostatic interactions (29Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (19731) Google Scholar). The cut-off for van der Waals interactions was set to 9 Å. Trajectories were analyzed using the GROMACS software package. Cluster analysis was performed using the GROMOS method (30Daura X. Gademann K. Jaun B. Seebach D. Van Gunsteren W.F. Mark A.E. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 236-240Crossref Google Scholar). Two 20-ns-long constant-volume simulations of the peptide corresponding to 14-3-3ζ sequence Trp228–Asn245 (both non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated at Thr232) at 300 K were also performed to sample conformational space of the C-terminal stretch. We have used the same simulation protocol as in the case of full-length 14-3-3ζ. Phosphorylation at Thr232 Inhibits 14-3-3ζ Binding Affinity for pRaf-259 Peptide—We used a steady-state fluorescence anisotropy-based method to test the effect of phosphorylation at Thr232 on the binding properties of 14-3-3. Peptides containing Raf-1 kinase sequence surrounding Ser259, which is a well characterized 14-3-3 binding motif (2Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S.

We tested binding abilities of both 14-3-3ζ WT and 14-3-3w242 mutant (this mutant contains a single Trp residue at position 242; other Trp residues were mutated to Phe) to make sure that mutations of tryptophan residues did not change the binding properties of 14-3-3. Titration data show that both 14-3-3ζ WT and 14-3-3w242 bind the pRaf-259 peptide with similar affinity, KD(WT) = 116 ± 26 nm and KD(14-3-3w242) = 140 ± 37 nm (Fig. 1). These values are in good agreement with previously published KD values of ∼110 nm (2Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S.

Both 14-3-3ζ WT and 14-3-3w242 phosphorylated by casein kinase I at Thr232 display significantly lower binding affinity for pRaf-259 peptide, KD(pWT) = 243 ± 42 nm and KD(p14-3-3w242) = 264 ± 49 nm. To study whether the introduction of a negatively charged amino acid residue can mimic the phosphorylation at Thr232, we generated the T232D mutant. This protein binds pRaf-259 peptide with affinity similar to that of the wild-type 14-3-3ζ, KD(T232D) = 142 ± 34 nm, indicating that in this case simple replacement of Thr with an Asp residue is not enough to mimic the effect of phosphorylation. Control binding experiments using all 14-3-3 constructs described above and a non-phosphorylated fluorescein-labeled Raf-259 peptide showed no significant changes in fluorescence anisotropy (data not shown). Phosphorylation at Thr232 Inhibits the Ability of 14-3-3ζ to Activate Serotonin N-Acetyltransferase—To further test whether the phosphorylation of 14-3-3ζ C-terminal stretch inhibits interaction between 14-3-3ζ and its binding partners, we examined the effect of phosphorylation at Thr232 on the 14-3-3-mediated enhancement of AANAT activity (8Obsil T.

HsNEU2 hydrolyzed 4-methylumbelliferyl α-NeuAc, α2→3 sialyllactose, glycoproteins (fetuin, α-acid glycoprotein, transferrin, and bovine submaxillary gland mucin), micellar gangliosides GD1a, GD1b, GT1b, and α2→3 paragloboside, and vesicular GM3. α2→6 sialyllactose, colominic acid, GM1 oligosaccharide, whereas micellar GM2 and GM1 were resistant. The optimal pH was 5.6, kinetics Michaelis-Menten type, Vmax varying from 250 IU/mg protein (GD1a) to 0.7 IU/mg protein (α1-acid glycoprotein), and Km in the millimolar range. HsNEU2 was activated by detergents (Triton X-100) only with gangliosidic substrates; the change of GM3 from vesicular to mixed micellar aggregation led to a 8.5-fold Vmax increase. HsNEU2 acted on gangliosides (GD1a, GM1, and GM2) at nanomolar concentrations. With these dispersions (studied in detailed on GM1), where monomers are bound to the tube wall or dilutedly associated (1:2000, mol/mol) to Triton X-100 micelles, the Vmax values were 25 and 72 μIU/mg protein, and Km was 10 and 15 × 10–9m, respectively. Remarkably, GM1 and GM2 were recognized only as monomers. HsNEU2 worked at pH 7.0 with an efficiency (compared with that at pH 5.6) ranging from 4% (on GD1a) to 64% (on α1-acid glycoprotein), from 7% (on GD1a) to 45% (on GM3) in the presence of Triton X-100, and from 30 to 40% on GM1 monomeric dispersion. These results show that HsNEU2 differentially recognizes the type of sialosyl linkage, the aglycone part of the substrate, and the supramolecular organization (monomer/micelle/vesicle) of gangliosides.

The last ability might be relevant in sialidase interactions with gangliosides under physiological conditions. Sialidases (N-acylneuraminosylglycohydrolases; EC 3.2.1.18) constitute a group of enzymes that hydrolytically remove sialic acid residues from sialoglycoconjugates. The wide occurrence of these enzymes from viruses and bacteria to vertebrates (1Saito M. Yu R.K. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1995: 261-313Google Scholar) highlights their importance in regulating the sialic acid content and turnover of sialoglycoconjugates, molecules that are fundamental to several cellular processes (2Schauer R. Kelm S. Reuter G. Roggentin P. Shaw L. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1995: 7-67Google Scholar). Due to their easier availability, viral and bacterial sialidases have been extensively studied at the molecular level, and the three-dimensional structure of several of them has been established (3Varghese J.N. Laver W.G. Colman P.M. Nature. 1983; 303: 35-40Google Scholar, 4Crennell S.J. Garman E.F. Laver W.G. Vimr E.R. Taylor G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9852-9856Google Scholar, 5Crennell S. Garman E. Laver G. Vimr E. Taylor G. Structure. 1994; 2: 535-544Google Scholar). Despite an amino acid sequence homology of only 35%, viral and bacterial sialidases share a similar molecular architecture with the protein chains folded into six-sided β-sheet barrels and the active site constituted by almost the same amino acids and organized in a similar manner (6Taylor G.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 830-837Google Scholar). The molecular features of mammalian sialidases, including the human enzymes, remained long obscure, since factors like subcellular localization (cytosol, plasma membrane, and lysosomes), low cellular content, and the labile nature of the purified enzymes prevented workers from obtaining sufficient amounts of pure and active enzyme for detailed studies (7Venerando B. Fiorilli A. Di Francesco L. Chiarini A. Monti E. Zizioli D. Tettamanti G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1208: 229-237Google Scholar, 8Saito M. Fronda C.L. Yu R.K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2205-2208Google Scholar). Beginning in 1993, several mammalian sialidases started being cloned from the corresponding cDNAs, prompting a great acceleration of the studies aimed at ascertaining their structural and kinetic properties (9Achyuthan K.E. Achyuthan A.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 129: 29-64Google Scholar, 10Monti E. Preti A. Venerando B. Borsani G. Neurochem. Res. 2002; 27: 649-663Google Scholar). Knowledge of the amino acid sequences of these sialidases provided insight into the following: (i) the differences between the lysosomal (NEU1) (11Bonten E. van der Spoel A. Fornerod M. Grosveld G. d'Azzo A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3156-3169Google Scholar, 12Milner C.M. Smith S.V. Carrillo M.B. Taylor G.L. Hollinshead M. Campbell R.D. J. Biol.

Borsani G. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1313-1321Google Scholar), and plasma membrane-associated (NEU3) sialidases (16Wada T. Yoshikawa Y. Tokuyama S. Kuwabara M. Akita H. Miyagi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 21-27Google Scholar, 17Monti E. Bassi M.T. Papini N. Riboni M. Manzoni M. Venerando B. Croci G. Preti A. Ballabio A. Tettamanti G. Borsani G. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 343-351Google Scholar), which are unequivocally different enzymes, and (ii) the structural homologies indicating that they belong, unequivocally too, to a unique family of proteins. Of course, a great advance provided by expressing mammalian sialidases in suitable host cells was to obtain pure proteins in adequate amounts and sufficient stability to perform systematic studies. Issues concerning mammalian sialidases that still require deeper understanding are their relationships with the putative natural substrates, particularly sialoglycolipids (gangliosides) and sialoglycoproteins and the conditions of their action under physiological conditions, since most of them feature in vitro an acidic optimal pH (1Saito M. Yu R.K. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1995: 261-313Google Scholar, 2Schauer R. Kelm S. Reuter G. Roggentin P. Shaw L. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids.

Rosenberg A. Biology of Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1995: 197-241Google Scholar). It is known that sialidases occur cellularly at different sites (plasma membrane, lysosomes, and cytosol), and sialoglycoconjugates occur primarily at the level of the plasma and Golgi's stack membranes (18Bhavanandan V.P. Furukawa K. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acid. Plenum Press, New York1995: 145-196Google Scholar, 19Nagai Y. Iwamori M. Rosenberg A. Biology of Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1995: 197-241Google Scholar) or inside the lysosomes, where their complete degradation occurs (2Schauer R. Kelm S. Reuter G. Roggentin P. Shaw L. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1995: 7-67Google Scholar, 18Bhavanandan V.P. Furukawa K. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acid. Plenum Press, New York1995: 145-196Google Scholar). Another possible difference can reside in the topology of membrane location (sidedness) of sialidases and sialoglycoconjugates. It is also known that (some) gangliosides can be highly enriched in lipid rafts on the plasma membrane together with other lipid components and specialized proteins (20Hakomori S. Yamamura S. Handa A.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 845: 1-10Google Scholar). These structures move within the fluid bilayer and may function as mobile platforms able to transduce signals from the outside to the interior of the cell (21Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Google Scholar). Of course, gangliosides are also present in a much more “diluted” way in the areas of the membrane surrounding rafts. Therefore, gangliosides occur as “patched” or “dispersed” molecules (monomeric dispersions), this constituting a further possible matter of differential recognition by sialidases. With regard to the physiological environment, the only one having an acidic pH is the lysosomal matrix, where the lysosomal sialidase works. However, both the plasma membrane-bound and the cytosolic sialidases, besides the lysosomal one, display an acidic pH optimum (1Saito M. Yu R.K. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1995: 261-313Google Scholar, 2Schauer R. Kelm S. Reuter G. Roggentin P. Shaw L. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1995: 7-67Google Scholar). On these premises and with the aim to provide a deeper insight into sialidase action, we (i) purified to homogeneity the recombinant form of the human cytosolic sialidase NEU2 (HsNEU2), produced by Escherichia coli cells, (ii) carried out a basic biochemical characterization of the enzyme, (iii) studied the specificity of the enzyme action on different sialoglycoconjugates, with particular attention to the ability of the enzyme to differentially recognize the aggregated (micellar) form and monomeric dispersion of the ganglioside substrates, and (iv) verified the ability of the enzyme to act at neutral pH.

The ganglioside nomenclature proposed by Svennerholm was followed (Svennerholm, L. (1980) Adv. Exp. Med. Biol.125, 11). NEU is the official human gene symbol approved by HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee. In order to avoid misinterpretation, the NEU symbol indicates the gene product (i.e. sialidase) is the symbol for cytosolic sialidase, the two-letter code preceding NEU2 indicates the species of origin (e.g. Hs indicates Homo sapiens). The entire coding region of HsNEU2 was obtained by PCR amplification using the isolated genomic clone HG7 as template as previously described (15Monti E. Preti A. Nesti C. Ballabio A. Borsani G. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1313-1321Google Scholar). Briefly, the DNA sequence from the Met to the Gln in position 67 (exon 1) was amplified using NEU2-Nt (5′-CGTAGATCTATGGCGTCCCTTCCTGTCCTG-3′) with a 5′-BamHI restriction site and a 5′-phosphorylated antisense primer (NEU2–67R; 5′-CTGAACCTGGTGGGTGGGTGC-3′). The DNA sequence from the Trp in position 68 to the stop codon (exon 2) was amplified using (NEU2-68F; 5′-TGGCAAGCTCAGGAGGTGGTG-3′) and NEU2-Ct (5′-CATGAATCCTCACTGAGGCAGGTACTG-3′) with a 5′-EcoRI restriction site. The two PCR products, obtained using cloned Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), were ligated using T4 ligase, and the resulting fragment was subcloned into BamHI-EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). The recombinant plasmid, pGEX-2T-NEU2, was completely sequenced using both vector- and gene-specific primers. E. coli DH5 α cells were transformed with the recombinant plasmid pGEX-2T-NEU2 or the expression vector pGEX-2T alone, and the transformed cells were grown in LB-ampicillin medium at 37 °C to midlog phase before the addition of isopropyl-α-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) to 0.05 mm. After overnight growth at room temperature, cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in 50 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells lysed by sonication and supernatants obtained after centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min were assayed for sialidase activity using MU-NeuAc as substrate. Purification of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-HsNEU2 fusion protein was carried out by affinity chromatography on a GSH-Sepharose 4B column (using the GST portion of the chimeric protein for affinity binding) according to the manufacturer's instructions (GST Gene Fusion System; Amersham Biosciences), with minor modifications. After an additional washing with PBS plus 0.5 m NaCl, cleavage of GST from the GST-HsNEU2 fusion protein bound to the matrix was carried out adding 0.5 IU of thrombin/ml in PBS and incubating the column for 2–3 h at room temperature. The resulting eluted enzyme was further purified by two successive high performance chromatographic steps. The first was on a MONO Q HR5/5 column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.3. The enzyme activity was eluted in the column flow-through and the collected fractions carrying the enzyme were dialyzed against four changes of 50 volumes of 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.7, at 4 °C, concentrated under vacuum to about 2 ml in a rotating evaporator and applied to a MONO S HR 5/5 column equilibrated in the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted using a linear gradient of 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.7, containing 1 m NaCl. The two chromatographic steps were carried out at room temperature with an elution rate of 1 ml/min and using an FPLC apparatus (Amersham Biosciences). Protein samples of E. coli crude lysate and of the different fractions obtained along the purification procedure were assayed for sialidase activity and protein content and monitored for purity by reducing SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) with GELCODE Blue Stain protein detection reagent (Pierce). The purity of the final enzyme preparation was assessed also by isoelectrofocusing according to Righetti (26Righetti P.G. Isoelectric Focusing: Theory, Methodology, and Applications. Elsevier, Amsterdam1983Google Scholar). Gangliosides GM1, GM2, GD1a, and GD1b from calf brain (27Tettamanti G. Bonali F. Marchesini S. Zambotti V. Biochim. Biophys.

Neurochem. 1976; 27: 511-515Google Scholar). GM1, GM2, and GD1a were 3H-labeled at C-3 of the sphingosine (Sph) moiety (32Ghidoni R. Sonnino S. Masserini M. Orlando P. Tettamanti G. J.

Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 620-629Google Scholar), were employed. GM3 was 3H-labeled at the level of the N-acetyl group of sialic acid ([NeuAc-3H]GM3) according to Chigorno et al. (34Chigorno V. Cardace G. Pitto M. Sonnino S. Ghidoni R. Tettamanti G. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 153: 283-294Google Scholar). GA1 3H-radiolabeled at the level of Sph was prepared according to Ref. 35Leskawa K.C. Dasgupta S. Chien J.L. Hogan E.L. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 140: 172-177Google Scholar. The radiochemical purity of [Sph-3H]GM1, [Sph-3H]GM2, [Sph-3H]GD1a, [NeuAc-3H]GM3, and [Sph-3H]GA1 was better than 99%, and the specific radioactivity was 1.63, 0.96, 1.85, 0.60, and 1.58 Ci mmol–1, respectively. Radiolabeled gangliosides were stored at –20 °C in n-propyl alcohol/water (4:1, v/v), and maintenance of radiochemical purity was assessed before use. It is known that gangliosides form micelles in water solution. Their critical micellar concentration (CMC) is in the range 10–8 to 10–7m, depending on the ganglioside (36Sonnino S. Cantu L. Corti M. Acquotti D. Venerando B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 71: 21-45Google Scholar). Therefore, at concentrations above the CMC (e.g. in the millimolar range), they are present essentially as micelles, whereas below the CMC (e.g. in the nanomolar range) they are present only as monomers. The only exception is ganglioside GM3 that undergoes vesicular aggregation in aqueous solution (36Sonnino S. Cantu L. Corti M. Acquotti D. Venerando B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 71: 21-45Google Scholar). Homogenous micelles of gangliosides α2→3SPG, GM1, GM2, GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b and homogenous vesicles of GM3 (with the addition of 0.15 μCi of the 3H-labeled form in the cases of GM1, GM2, GD1a, and GM3) were prepared as follows. Each ganglioside was dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and a known volume of this solution, containing the desired amount of ganglioside, was transferred into an Eppendorf tube, the solvent being then completely removed by nitrogen fluxing. The residue was kept for several hours under vacuum over P2O5 and then dissolved with 60 μl of redistilled water. The mixture was left to stand overnight at room temperature before use (37Fiorilli A. Venerando B. Siniscalco C. Monti E. Bresciani R. Caimi L. Preti A. Tettamanti G. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 672-680Google Scholar). Mixed micelles of gangliosides and detergent (Triton X-100) were prepared as follows. Detergent (at millimolar concentrations) was dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and a known volume of this solution was pipetted into an Eppendorf tube and mixed with a sample of the starting ganglioside solution in order to have the desired proportion of the two components. The solvent was completely removed by nitrogen fluxing, and the resulting residue was further dried, dissolved in 60 μl of redistilled water, and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature, as described above. At the end, each mixture was buffered and used for sialidase assay in a final volume of 100 μl. A known volume of ganglioside solution in n-propyl alcohol/water (4:1, v/v), containing the desired amount (0.1–6.4 pmol) of 3H-labeled GM2, GM1, or GD1a was transferred into an Eppendorf tube, and the solvent was completely removed by nitrogen fluxing. The residue was kept for several hours under vacuum over P2O5 and then dissolved with 60 μl of redistilled water and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature. At the end, the mixture was buffered and used for sialidase assays, in a final volume of 100 μl. Under these conditions, the ganglioside molecules are known (36Sonnino S. Cantu L. Corti M. Acquotti D. Venerando B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 71: 21-45Google Scholar) to adhere, at least partially, to the tube surface. In order to establish the distribution of ganglioside, as well as the sialidase reaction product(s), between the aqueous solution and the tube surface, the aqueous assay mixture (before and after incubation with sialidase) was transferred with a Pasteur pipette into a tube, the pipette being washed several times with methanol, and the washings were added to the pipetted incubation mixture. The resulting mixture, containing the glycolipid in free solution, was frozen and lyophilized. The residue was resuspended with 5 ml of emulsifier (Ultima Gold; Packard), and the radioactivity was determined with a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Tri-Carb 460). The starting Eppendorf tube, carrying the wall-bound ganglioside, was added with 0.1 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and mixed, and the radioactivity was measured as described above. The conditions providing passage of monomeric dispersions of glycolipid from the tube wall to the aqueous medium were worked out with preliminary experiments using [Sph-3H]GM1 and Triton X-100. The experimental approaches were as follows. (i) 0.1–2 pmol of [Sph-3H]GM1 in n-propyl alcohol/water (2:1, v/v) and different amounts of Triton X-100 (0.4–40 nmol) in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) were transferred into an Eppendorf tube, and the solvent was completely removed by nitrogen fluxing. The resulting residue was kept for several hours under vacuum over P2O5 and finally dissolved with 60 μl of redistilled water and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature. The mixture was then added with buffer (at the optimal sialidase pH 5.6 or at pH 7.0) and enzyme (final volume 100 μl) and used for sialidase assays. The distribution of GM1 and sialidase reaction product in the aqueous solution and tube wall was determined as described above. (ii) 40 nmol of Triton X-100 in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and different amounts of [Sph-3H]GM1 (0.9–83 pmol) in n-propyl alcohol/water (4:1, v/v) were transferred in an Eppendorf tube, and the solvent was completely removed by nitrogen fluxing; the successive procedural steps were the same as described above. On the basis of the indications provided by the experimental approaches described above, complete dispersion of [Sph-3H]GM1 on the surface of Triton X-100 micelles was obtained mixing radiolabeled GM1 and Triton X-100 in a molar ratio of 1:2000. On this basis, the proper amount of [Sph-3H]GM1 in n-propyl alcohol/water (4:1, v/v) and a 2000-fold (in molar terms) amount of Triton X-100 in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) were pipetted into an Eppendorf tube, and the solvent was completely removed by nitrogen fluxing; the subsequent steps were the same described above. The activity of HsNEU2 sialidase was determined essentially as described by Venerando et al. (38Venerando B. Fiorilli A. Croci G.L. Tettamanti G. Blood. 1997; 90: 2047-2056Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures contained the established amounts of HsNEU2 and substrate (see below), 50 mm sodium citrate/phosphate buffer at the optimum pH (established to be 5.6 and at pH 7.0) in a final volume of 100 μl. The control mixtures (blanks) were carried out using heat-inactivated (5 min in boiling water) recombinant HsNEU2. Km and apparent Vmax values were determined by the method of Lineweaver and Burk. The sialidase activity was expressed as IU (μmol of liberated NeuAc/min at 37 °C). The results are always the means of two or three separate experiments carried out in triplicate. The influence on sialidase activity of the following detergents was studied: Triton X-100, CHAPS, octyl glucoside, and sodium deoxycholate. The following assay methods were employed. The reaction mixtures (100 μl) set up with an appropriate concentration of MU-NeuAc, in the presence or absence of 20 μg of bovine serum albumin and of different amounts of a detergent (when used) were incubated at 37 °C with recombinant HsNEU2 (0.02 μg at pH 5.6; 0.15 μg at pH 7.0) for 10 min (pH 5.6) or 20 min (pH 7.0). Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1.5 ml of 0.2 m glycine/NaOH, pH 10.2. Fluorescence emission was measured on a Jasco FP-770 fluorometer with excitation at 365 nm and emission at 445 nm, using 4-methylumbelliferone to set up a calibration curve. A fluorescence of 0.100 corresponded to 0.16 nmol of released 4-methylumbelliferone. The reaction mixtures (100 μl) were set up with appropriate concentrations of α2→3 (or α2→6) sialyllactose, colominic acid, sialoglycoprotein (human fetuin, human α1-acid glycoprotein, human transferrin, and mucin from bovine submaxillary glands), or gangliosides α2→3SPG, GD1b, and GT1b (the ganglioside concentration was in the millimolar range). After incubation at 37 °C with recombinant HsNEU2 (0.2 μg at pH 5.6; 1.5 μg at pH 7.0) up to 90 min (depending on the substrate), released sialic acid was measured by the chromatographic microprocedure of Caimi et al. (39Caimi L. Lombardo A. Preti A. Wiesmann U. Tettamanti G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 571: 137-146Google Scholar). Ganglioside Substrates Used as Micellar Aggregates—The incubation mixtures (100 μl), containing different concentrations (in the millimolar range) of micellar 3H-labeled ganglioside GM1, GM2, or GD1a or vesicular GM3 (each carrying 0.15 μCi of radioactivity) and in the presence or absence of different amounts of detergent, were incubated at 37 °C with recombinant HsNEU2 (0.02 μg at pH 5.6; 0.15 μg at pH 7.0) for up to 10 min (pH 5.6) or 30 min (pH 7.0) or up to 60 min in the case of GM1 and GM2. The incubations were terminated by cooling the tubes in an ice bath, adding 400 μl of tetrahydrofuran and careful vortexing. The mixtures were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and 5 μl of the resulting supernatants were subjected to HPTLC on silica gel plates with chloroform, methanol, 0.2% aqueous CaCl2 (50:42:11, v/v/v) as a solvent system to separate the reaction products from the substrates. The separated glycolipids were quantified by radiochromatoscanning (Beta Imager 2000, equipped with the software interface Beta Vision, Dell Optiplex Systems, Biospace Mesures, Paris, France), and the enzyme activity was calculated as described (38Venerando B. Fiorilli A. Croci G.L. Tettamanti G. Blood. 1997; 90: 2047-2056Google Scholar). Monomeric Dispersions of Gangliosides as Substrates—The assay of sialidase activity on monomeric dispersions of 3H-labeled gangliosides (GM1 in most experiments; GD1a and GM2 in some experiments) was carried out as follows. The incubation mixtures (100 μl) set up in Eppendorf tubes and containing monomeric dispersions of ganglioside (concentrati"
https://openalex.org/W1979854417,"Neutrophil adhesion to extracellular matrix is necessary for an effective inflammatory response. Adhesion may accelerate neutrophil activation by affecting intracellular signaling pathways. The nuclear transcription factor κB (NF-κB) controls several cellular functions, including inflammation, proliferation, and cell survival. We explored the role of adhesion in NF-κB activation in human neutrophils. Cells were stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). All four initiated neutrophil adherence to and spreading on fibronectin. GM-CSF and IL-8 did not activate NF-κB in suspended neutrophils but rapidly activated NF-κB under adherent conditions on matrix, as shown by IκB kinase activity assay, IκBα degradation, electromobility shift assay, and quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. In contrast, TNF–α activated NF-κB both in suspended cells and adherent cells. fMLP did not activate NF-κB in either suspended or adherent cells. Specific β2 integrin blockade prevented NF-κB activation by GM-CSF and IL-8 on fibronectin. Co-stimulating CD18 and CD11b with activating antibodies resulted in NF-κB activation by GM-CSF and IL-8 in suspended cells. We inhibited actin polymerization with cytochalasin and blocked the non-receptor kinase Syk with piceatannol. Both maneuvers prevented the co-stimulatory NF-κB-activating signal by β2 integrins. Thus, in addition to β2 integrin ligand binding, NF-κB activation depended on the formation of the receptor-associated intracellular focal adhesion complex. We conclude that β2 integrins may provide co-stimulatory signals allowing some soluble mediators to activate the NF-κB pathway even when they are not capable of doing so in suspension. This effect may become important when human neutrophils leave the circulating blood and migrate through extracellular matrix during inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2039858705,"Pygopus and Legless/Bcl-9 are recently discovered core components of the Wnt signaling pathway that are required for the transcriptional activity of Armadillo/β-catenin and T cell factors. It has been proposed that they are part of a tri-partite adaptor chain (Armadillo>Legless>Pygopus) that recruits transcriptional co-activator complexes to DNA-bound T cell factor. Here, we identify four conserved residues at the putative PHD domain surface of Drosophila and mouse Pygopus that are required for their binding to Legless in vitro and in vivo. The same residues are also critical for the transactivation potential of DNA-tethered Pygopus in transfected mammalian cells and for rescue activity of pygopus mutant embryos. These residues at the Legless>Pygopus interface thus define a specific molecular target for blocking Wnt signaling during development and cancer.

These residues at the Legless>Pygopus interface thus define a specific molecular target for blocking Wnt signaling during development and cancer. Wnt signaling controls the transcription of genes that have important functions during normal and malignant development (1Cadigan K.M. Nusse R.

A key effector of the canonical Wnt pathway is β-catenin, or Drosophila Armadillo. This protein is normally degraded rapidly, but is stabilized in response to Wnt signaling and translocates to the nucleus where it binds T cell factors (TCF) 1The abbreviations used are: TCFT cell factorCBPCREB-binding proteinCREBcAMP-response element-binding proteinPygoPygopusLgsLeglessARDArmadillo repeat domainHAhemagglutininGFPgreen fluorescent proteinNLSnuclear localization signal. to stimulate the transcription of Wnt target genes. Thus, β-catenin/Armadillo functions as a transcriptional coactivator (4van de Wetering M. Cavallo R. Dooijes D. van Beest M. van Es J. Loureiro J. Ypma A. Hursh D. Jones T. Bejsovec A. Peifer M.

Recently, two new core components of the Wingless signaling pathway have been discovered by Drosophila genetics, called Pygopus (Pygo) and Legless (Lgs) (9Kramps T. Peter O. Brunner E. Nellen D.

These components are found in the nucleus, and have closely related counterparts in mammals (Pygo1, Pygo2, and Bcl-9). The transcriptional activity of Armadillo/β-catenin depends on these factors. Pygo contains a PHD domain that binds to Lgs/Bcl-9 in vitro, whereas Lgs/Bcl-9 binds to the Armadillo repeat domain (ARD) of Armadillo/β-catenin. Thus, Lgs/Bcl-9 serves as an adaptor between Armadillo/β-catenin and Pygo; the latter two proteins can be co-immunoprecipitated from Drosophila and mammalian cells. It has been suggested that Pygo and Lgs mediate transcriptional co-activation or access to chromatin, but their precise molecular functions are unknown. One of the main interests in Pygo and Lgs/Bcl-9 regarding cancer is that they provide potentially new targets for Wnt signaling inhibitors. Indeed, interference with hPygo1 or hPygo2 function by double-stranded RNA reduces the high levels of TCF/β-catenin-mediated transcription in colorectal cancer cells (10Thompson B. Townsley F.M. Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Musisi H. Bienz M. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2002; 4: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Thus, we set out to characterize the interaction between Pygo and Lgs at the molecular and cellular biological levels. Here, we identify conserved residues within Pygo and mPygo1 that are required for their binding to Lgs in vitro and for their activity in mammalian transcription assays. Rescue assays in Drosophila demonstrate that these residues are essential for Pygo to function during development. We also identify additional conserved residues within the PHD domain of Pygo that contribute to its transcriptional activity in mammalian cells. Plasmids and in Vitro Binding Assays—The PHD domains of Pygo (residues 735–815), mPygo1 (228–319), and full-length mPygo1 were subcloned into pGex-2TK (Amersham Biosciences) using standard PCR cloning procedures and were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. LgsHD1 + 2 (232–555) was subcloned into pT7β, 35S-labeled protein was generated by in vitro transcription/translation, and in vitro pull-down assays were performed as described (10Thompson B. Townsley F.M. Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Musisi H. Bienz M. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2002; 4: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). For expression in mammalian cells, full-length Lgs and LgsHD1 + 2 (9Kramps T. Peter O. Brunner E. Nellen D. Froesch B. Chatterjee S. Murone M. Zullig S. Basler K.

For GDB fusions, full-length Pygo and PygoΔPHD (1–749) were subcloned into pBIND (Promega); this vector also encodes renilla luciferase (as an internal control). pG5Luc (Promega) was used to measure the transcriptional activity of GDB-Pygo fusions. Point mutations (see Fig. 1A) were introduced with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and each construct was confirmed by sequencing. mLoop1 is a quadruple (E756A, N758A, D759A, D761A), and mLoop2 is a quintuple mutant (L781A, T782A, E783A, A785V, L789A). Cell Transfections and Transcription Activation Assays—293T cells were grown and transfected as described (10Thompson B. Townsley F.M. Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Musisi H. Bienz M. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2002; 4: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar); unless specified otherwise, 1–2 μg of DNA were used per well of a six-well plate.

Relative luciferase values (see Fig. 4) were obtained (from duplicate samples) by dividing the firefly luciferase values obtained from pG5Luc by the renilla luciferase values obtained from SV-renilla included in the GDB-Pygo fusion plasmids; averages from at least three different experiments were determined. GDB-Pygo fusions were not detectable by Western blotting, presumably because of lack of sensitivity of the anti-GAL4 antibody (Clontech), but each construct was detectable as HA-tagged protein and expressed at equivalent levels in transfected 293T cells (see Fig. 2; not shown).Fig. 4The transactivation potential of DNA-tethered Pygo. 293T cells were co-transfected with pG5Luc and wild-type or mutant GDB-Pygo; their transactivation potential is indicated by the relative luciferase values.

Development. 2002; 129: 2565-2576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was also used. Overexpression in the wing and co-expression in the eye with activated Armadillo (8Barker N. Hurlstone A. Musisi H. Miles A. Bienz M. Clevers H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) were used for comparative assessment of the activities of wild-type and mutant Pygo among the different transformant lines. These revealed only small variations between different lines, most of which express comparable levels of protein as judged by Western blot analysis (with anti-HA antibody; see above). For the rescue assays, wild-type and mutant HA-tagged Pygo were expressed with the ubiquitous driver daughterless GAL4 in germ-line clones of the null allele pygoS123 and of the hypomorphic allele pygoS28 (10Thompson B. Townsley F.M. Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Musisi H. Bienz M. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2002; 4: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). pygo mutants lacking maternal and zygotic Pygo were identified on the basis of GFP-marked balancers; GFP-negative embryos lack maternal and zygotic pygo function; one-half of these carry the GAL4 driver and thus express the Pygo rescue construct. Each construct was tested in two to three independent experiments. In the case of wild-type Pygo or mLoop1, the GFP-negative embryos fell into two clear classes of homogeneous phenotypes: (i) denticle lawns as observed after loss of maternal and zygotic pygo function (see Fig. 5B), or (ii) rescued cuticles (see Fig. 5D) as those observed after zygotic (paternal) rescue (see Fig. 5C). In the case of pygoS28, the “rescued cuticle” class looked essentially wild-type, with only minor segmentation defects (like the paternally rescued pygoS28 cuticles; not shown). The following percentages of rescued cuticles were observed: pygoS123, 64%, 65%, and 47% (wild-type Pygo; total of 79 embryos scored); 53%, 59%, and 50% (mLoop1; total of 74 embryos scored); pygoS28, 50%, 50%, and 51% (wild-type Pygo; total of 81 embryos scored); 53%, 52%, and 43% (mLoop1; total of 99 embryos scored). In the case of mLoop2, 100% denticle lawn cuticles were observed (for pygoS123, a total of 79 GFP-negative embryos were scored, see Fig. 5D; for pygoS28, a total of 33 GFP-negative embryos were scored, not shown), which is indistinguishable from those due to maternal and zygotic pygo loss (see Fig. 5B; not shown). In Vitro Binding between Pygo and Lgs—To determine the residues within the PHD domain of Pygo that are required for its binding to Lgs, we individually mutated each conserved residue predicted to be at the surface (17Capili A.D.

We expressed the wild-type and mutant domains fused to glutathione S-transferase in bacteria, and tested their binding to an in vitro-translated fragment of Lgs that spans both Pygo- and Armadillo-interacting domains (HD1 + 2; Ref. 9Kramps T. Peter O. Brunner E. Nellen D. Froesch B. Chatterjee S. Murone M. Zullig S. Basler K. Cell. 2002; 109: 47-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) by pull-down assays. As expected, the wild-type PHD domain of Pygo binds efficiently to LgsHD1 + 2 in this assay (Fig. 1C, lane 3), as does the ARD of Armadillo (Fig. 1C, lane 14). Furthermore, the C753A mutation drastically reduces the binding of the PHD domain to Lgs (Fig. 1B, lane 5), confirming the predicted structural importance of Cys-2. Of the other 15 point mutations, only 3 have a comparable effect on binding (namely L781A, T782A, and L789A) and one further mutation (A785V) reduces the binding significantly (Fig. 1C, lanes 8–10, 20). The other mutations have little or no effect on the binding of Pygo to Lgs (Fig. 1C). These results identify Leu-781, Thr-782, Ala-785, and Leu-789 as four Pygo residues that are critical for the binding of Pygo to Lgs. Interestingly, these residues are all located in the same loop (Loop 2) between the zinc-coordinating cysteines Cys-5 and Cys-6 (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, if the PHD domain is projected onto the structurally related RING finger domain (from c-Cbl, a Glu-3 ubiquitin ligase), the four Loop2 residues from Pygo span a region that corresponds to an α-helical surface portion of c-Cbl that contacts its binding partner Rad18 (a Glu-3 ubiquitin ligase) (19Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Conversely, Loop1 residues (between Cys-2 and Cys-3; Fig. 1B) are predicted to be on the opposite surface of the PHD domain; Loop1 mutations do not substantially affect the binding between Pygo and Lgs (Fig. 1B, lanes 6, 7, 15–17). Thus, the Loop1 surface does not seem to be involved in binding to Lgs, whereas the above-mentioned four Loop2 residues of Pygo may all directly contact Lgs. These Loop2 residues are either identical (Thr-782, Ala-785, Leu-789) or substituted by a similar amino acid (methionine instead of Leu-781) in mouse and human Pygo proteins (Fig. 1A). To test the function of the corresponding mammalian residues, we mutated two on each surface and also the structural Cys-2 residue in mPygo1 (Fig. 1A) and compared their in vitro binding to Lgs HD1 + 2 to that of wild-type mPygo1. This confirmed that Cys-2 and the two mutated Loop2 residues are critical for binding between mPygo1 and Lgs (Fig. 1D, lanes 5, 8, 9), whereas the Loop1 mutations do not substantially affect the binding (Fig. 1D, lanes 6, 7). Thus, the binding between Lgs and Pygo proteins is highly comparable between Drosophila and mammals. In Vivo Binding between Pygo and Lgs—Next, we introduced a subset of the same mutations into full-length Pygo and expressed wild-type and mutant Pygo together with Lgs HD1 + 2 in mammalian 293T cells. In the absence of Pygo, the Lgs fragment is largely cytoplasmic in these cells, although some nuclear staining is also observed (Fig. 2A). However, after co-transfection with Pygo, which itself is exclusively nuclear in these cells (10Thompson B. Townsley F.M. Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Musisi H. Bienz M. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2002; 4: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), HD1 + 2 is shifted efficiently into the nucleus (Fig. 2B), most likely because of its binding to Pygo. In support of this, HD1 + 2 is also shifted into the nucleus by the C-terminal fragment of Pygo that spans the PHD domain (Fig. 2C), whereas its nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution does not change if it is co-transfected with a Pygo deletion that lacks the PHD domain (Fig. 2D). The same is true for the Cys-2 mutation (Fig. 2E), although Cys-2 appears to aggregate somewhat in the nucleus (presumably because of misfolding), trapping the nuclear HD1 + 2 into these nuclear dots. Importantly, neither of the two Loop2 mutations we tested (L789A and L781A) affects the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of HD1 + 2 (Fig. 2F; not shown), whereas the two Loop1 mutants (N758A and D761A) are fully capable of shifting HD1 + 2 into the nucleus (Fig. 2G; not shown). Thus, the Loop2 residues are critical for the in vivo interaction between Pygo and Lgs, whereas the Loop1 residues are irrelevant for this interaction. The same is essentially true for mPygo1. The full-length protein shifts HD1 + 2 into the nucleus as efficiently as Pygo (Fig. 2J), as do the two Loop1 mutants in mPygo1 (Q254A and N251A; Fig. 2K; not shown). In contrast, no change is seen with the Cys-2 mutant (Fig. 2L), nor with the Loop2 mutant L282A (Fig. 2M), confirming the importance of this loop. The other Loop2 mutant (T275A) still facilitates nuclear uptake of HD1 + 2 (Fig. 2N) and is thus not severe enough to abolish the in vivo interaction between mPygo1 and Lgs, despite reducing their in vitro binding (Fig. 1D, lane 8). We also tested the conserved N-terminal residues of Pygo for their role in its in vivo interaction with Lgs. These include a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and the N-box (10Thompson B. Townsley F.M. Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Musisi H. Bienz M. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2002; 4: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) that spans a series of proline residues and an NPFXD motif (Fig. 1A). The latter can be an internalization signal (20Tan P.K. Howard J.P. Payne G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1789-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and binds to a variety of endocytic proteins (21Howard J.P. Hutton J.L. Olson J.M. Payne G.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We generated three sets of point mutations in the N terminus (Fig. 1A) and tested the mutants in transfected 293T cells with and without HD1 + 2. Each of these mutants is fully competent in shifting Lgs to the nucleus (Fig. 2, H and I; not shown), confirming that they are not required for the Lgs>Pygo interaction in the context of full-length Pygo. Notably, the Nnls mutation only weakly reduces the nuclear accumulation of Pygo (Fig. 2H), which is consistent with our observation that the C terminus of Pygo is nuclear despite not containing an NLS (Fig. 2C). Thus, the NLS and the C terminus of Pygo function redundantly to mediate its nuclear accumulation. In the case of the C terminus, this may be caused by a nuclear protein that binds to the PHD domain and anchors it in the nucleus. Transcriptional Activation by DNA-tethered Pygo—It has been reported (15Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2947) Google Scholar) that overexpressed hPygo1 stimulates the transcription of a luciferase reporter linked to TCF-binding sites (pTOPFLASH) in transfected 293 cells ∼30-fold if co-expressed with activated β-catenin, suggesting that Pygo may act as a transcriptional co-activator (9Kramps T. Peter O. Brunner E. Nellen D. Froesch B. Chatterjee S. Murone M. Zullig S. Basler K. Cell. 2002; 109: 47-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). However, in our own experiments in transfected 293T cells, we observed, at best, a very mild transcriptional stimulation (<2×) with any of the mammalian Pygo proteins in the presence of varying amounts of activated β-catenin (Fig. 3, A and B). However, this stimulation seems to be insignificant because we see the same stimulation with a Pygo protein whose PHD domain has been deleted (Fig. 3A). The same is true for Drosophila Pygo, which did not stimulate TCF-mediated transcription by itself, in the presence of Armadillo, and/or in the presence of dTCF (Fig. 3C). Notably, co-expression of increasing amounts of Lgs, Lgs HD1 + 2, or hBcl-9 does not improve the transcriptional stimulation (Fig. 3D; not shown). Therefore, we conclude that overexpressed Pygo proteins cannot stimulate the transcription of TCF target genes in these cells, neither alone nor in the presence of co-expressed Lgs/Bcl-9 or TCF. However, if tethered to DNA with the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 (GDB-Pygo), full-length Pygo efficiently stimulates transcription of a luciferase reporter linked to GAL4 upstream activating sequences (Fig. 4). A similar stimulation has also been observed with a GDB fusion of Pygo that lacks its N terminus (12Belenkaya T.Y. Han C. Standley H.J. Lin X. Houston D.W. Heasman J. Development. 2002; 129: 4089-4101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the latter is dispensable for transactivation. Consistent with this, the activity of GDB-Pygo is >10-fold reduced if its PHD domain is deleted (Fig. 4; note that the expression levels of the Pygo mutants are all comparable with those of full-length wild-type Pygo; Fig. 2). Likewise, the Cys-2 mutant is equally inactive in stimulating transcription (Fig. 4). Thus, Pygo can stimulate transcription efficiently if tethered to DNA; this activity depends on its PHD domain. Next, we tested our mutants as GDB-Pygo fusions. Individual point mutations only mildly reduce transactivation, maximally ∼2.8× (C753A; Fig. 4). Of the Loop2 mutations, the most severe one is L781A (<2× reduction; Fig. 4). Interestingly, the most severe reduction (apart from C753A) is observed with the Loop1 mutation D761A (Fig. 4). Other Loop1 and Loop2 mutations also show mild effects, and multiple mutations in the same loop (mLoop1, mLoop2) have more severe effects, whereas maximal effects are seen with simultaneous mutations in both loops (Fig. 4). We conclude that residues in both surface loops of the PHD domain contribute to the transcriptional activity of DNA-tethered Pygo. This conclusion implies that this activity not only depends on its binding to Lgs, but also on its ability to bind to another protein. The latter is unlikely to be Pygo itself, because we have not been able to detect dimerization of Pygo nor of its C-terminal fragment in our in vitro or in vivo binding assays (not shown). Therefore, an unknown Loop1-binding protein seems to synergize with Lgs in transcriptional activation. Loop2 Residues Are Essential for Rescue of pygo Mutants— The transcriptional activity of DNA-tethered Pygo measured in our transfection assays is likely to depend on a variety of endogenous proteins, e.g. hPygo1 and hPygo2, which may mask the functional importance of specific residues under test. Thus, we used the GAL4 system to express three of the Pygo mutants in Drosophila embryos to see whether they could rescue pygo mutants that lack endogenous Pygo. Wild-type Pygo expressed ubiquitously in the embryo rescues the “denticle lawn” phenotype of pygo mutants to a considerable extent (Fig. 5D, compare with A and B; see also “Experimental Procedures”). Indeed, the rescued cuticles look essentially the same as those from paternally rescued pygo mutants (i.e. from embryos whose only source of wild-type Pygo is due to zygotic expression of the paternal allele; Fig. 2C). The same is true for the Nnpf mutant (not shown), suggesting that the NPFXD motif is either not essential, or that it functions redundantly with other Pygo sequences. The mLoop1 mutant also rescues (Fig. 5E, compare with C and D), so the conserved Loop1 residues are either not required in untethered Pygo, or they function redundantly with other Pygo sequences in flies. Also, the mLoop1 mutant may not be completely defective in binding to its cognate protein. In contrast, the mLoop2 mutant does not rescue pygo mutants at all (Fig. 5F, compare with B; notably, this mutant is expressed at normal levels in embryos and produces similar phenotypes in the wing and eye as does wild-type Pygo; see “Experimental Procedures”). The same results were obtained in rescue assays of a hypomorphic pygo allele (pygoS28); in this case, wild-type Pygo, Nnpf, and mLoop1 fully restore the cuticles to wild-type (not shown; see “Experimental Procedures”). Thus, the four conserved Pygo Loop2 residues implicated in Lgs binding are critical for the function of Pygo during embryonic development. We have identified four conserved residues in the PHD domain of Pygo required for its binding to Lgs that are critical for its function in transcription and embryonic development. These residues are predicted to be in a contiguous surface patch of the PHD domain (17Capili A.D. Schultz D.C. Rauscher I.F. Borden K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 18Pascual J. Martinez-Yamout M. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and are thus likely to contact Lgs directly. Given the functional importance of these Loop2 residues, it is likely that blocking their binding to Lgs/Bcl-9 will reduce Wnt signaling activity in normal and malignant cells. How Pygo and Lgs function molecularly in the transcription of Wnt target genes is still unclear. It has been suggested (9Kramps T. Peter O. Brunner E. Nellen D. Froesch B. Chatterjee S. Murone M. Zullig S. Basler K. Cell. 2002; 109: 47-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) that Pygo is recruited to DNA-bound TCF through Lgs/Bcl-9 and Armadillo/β-catenin and that the N terminus of Pygo recruits a co-activator complex or components of the general transcription machinery. Its PHD domain has been implicated in the former, and our work demonstrates the importance of specific Loop2 residues in this recruitment step. As yet, there is no direct evidence for the functional importance of the N terminus of Pygo. This portion of the protein is not required for transactivation by DNA-tethered Pygo (12Belenkaya T.Y. Han C. Standley H.J. Lin X. Houston D.W. Heasman J. Development. 2002; 129: 4089-4101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). We also failed to detect a function of the conserved NPFXD motif within the N-box. However, it is possible that our mutations have not inactivated the N terminus sufficiently to reveal its function. Also, the N terminus may act redundantly with other Pygo sequences. Perhaps our most puzzling result is the striking difference in the transactivation potential of untethered Pygo versus DNA-tethered Pygo: the latter is highly active in stimulating transcription (Fig. 4; Ref. 12Belenkaya T.Y. Han C. Standley H.J. Lin X. Houston D.W. Heasman J. Development. 2002; 129: 4089-4101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the former is essentially inactive in transfected 293T cells (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained by other investigators 2W. de Lau and H. Clevers, personal communication. who also found that overexpressed untethered Pygo proteins do not stimulate TOPFLASH transcription either in transfected 293 or 293T cells, even in the presence of co-expressed Bcl-9. Therefore, the suggestion that Pygo may act as a transcriptional co-activator (9Kramps T. Peter O. Brunner E. Nellen D. Froesch B. Chatterjee S. Murone M. Zullig S. Basler K. Cell. 2002; 109: 47-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) may need revisiting. But how can the difference in activity between untethered and DNA-tethered Pygo be explained? Because our transcription assays measured the effects of overexpressed protein in conjunction with endogenous factors, a stimulatory effect could only be observed if none of these are limiting. Given that the direct linkage of Pygo to a DNA-binding domain confers on it high transactivation potential, this implies that the rate-limiting step in these assays is the recruitment of Pygo to DNA. Recall that this apparently involves the three proteins TCF>β-catenin>Lgs, but none of these are likely to limit the function of exogenous (untethered) Pygo; its transactivation potential cannot be revealed even if these factors are co-overexpressed (Fig. 3). However, one possible explanation is that the direct tethering of Pygo to DNA by means of a DNA-binding domain is likely to be far more efficient than indirect recruitment by means of a three-protein adaptor chain. Bypassing this chain may allow us to detect the intrinsic transactivation potential of Pygo. Our transcription assays have identified conserved Loop1 residues that contribute to the transactivation potential of DNA-tethered Pygo. These Loop1 residues are predicted to be at a PHD domain surface opposite to its putative Lgs-interacting surface (17Capili A.D. Schultz D.C. Rauscher I.F. Borden K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 18Pascual J. Martinez-Yamout M. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). They do not seem to be involved in intramolecular interactions nor in homo-dimerization, nor is this surface of the PHD domain predicted to be involved in the putative binding to phosphoinositides (22Gozani O. Karuman P. Jones D.R. Ivanov D. Cha J. Lugovskoy A.A. Baird C.L. Zhu H. Field S.J. Lessnick S.L. Villasenor J. Mehrotra B. Chen J. Rao V.R. Brugge J.S. Ferguson C.G. Payrastre B. Myszka D.G. Cantley L.C. Wagner G. Divecha N. Prestwich G.D. Yuan J. Cell. 2003; 114: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), so they are likely to mediate binding to an unknown ligand. Our rescue assays in embryos have not mirrored their functional importance in mammalian transcription assays for a number of possible reasons (see above). The ultimate proof of their functional significance will have to await the identification of their cognate Loop1-binding ligand. An early if not initiating event in colorectal tumorigenesis is the loss of the Adenomatous polyposis tumor suppressor that results in activated TCF-mediated transcription (2Bienz M. Clevers H. Cell. 2000; 103: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 3Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Elevated TCF-mediated transcription can also be caused by activating mutations in β-catenin, which are found in colorectal and many other types of cancers (23Polakis P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Blocking TCF-mediated transcription in colorectal cancer cells reduces their proliferative potential (24van de Wetering M. Sancho E. Verweij C. de Lau W. Oving I. Hurlstone A. van der Horn K. Batlle E. Coudreuse D. Haramis A.P. Tjon-Pon-Fong M. Moerer P. van den Born M. Soete G. Pals S. Eilers M. Medema R. Clevers H. Cell. 2002; 111: 241-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar) and may thus attenuate the progression of colorectal tumors. Until recently, the only molecular candidate target for disruption has been the TCF/β-catenin interface. However, TCF factors bind to the same surface of β-catenin as some of its negative regulators and mimic their interaction with β-catenin (25Daniels D.L. Eklof Spink K. Weis W.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 672-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), so this interface is not an ideal target. Pygo and Lgs/Bcl-9 provide new potential targets, with two unique binding surfaces that do not seem to be shared with other binding partners. The four conserved Loop2 residues of Pygo that we have shown to be critical for Lgs binding and in vivo function define the interaction between the two proteins at the molecular level and may help to develop their interface as a suitable molecular target for disruption in cancer."

In addition to the 10 centrally condensed viral double-stranded RNA genome segments cores contain five different viral proteins in defined copy numbers (Table I). Virions contain three additional viral proteins that play key roles in particle stability and cell entry. The viral mRNAs are full-length plus-strand copies of the genome segments 1200–3900 nucleotides in length, modified by a dimethylated cap 1 structure at their 5′ ends and not polyadenylated. The manner in which the double-stranded RNA genome segments and mRNA products interact with the transcription and capping machinery in mORV cores is a topic of interest for understanding structural and mechanistic aspects of these processes in this and other viral and cellular systems.Table ImORV core proteins and their enzymatic activitiesCore proteinMassaMolecular mass from deduced sequenceCopy no.bMolecules per virion or core particleCrystal structureEnzymatic activitiescDemonstrated in vitro or inferred from crystal structure in the cited referencesReferenceskDaλ1142120YesdRef. 4NTPase30Bisaillon M.

To obtain an atomic model for λ3, which is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (6Drayna D. Fields B.N. J. Virol. 1982; 41: 110-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Morozov S.Y.

Virology. 1993; 193: 356-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and, thus, a functionally key element, a 2.5-Å crystal structure of recombinant λ3 has been determined (9Tao Y. Farsetta D.L. Nibert M.L. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2002; 111: 733-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In addition, the λ3 structure has recently been fit into a 7.6-Å electron cryomicroscopy reconstruction of the mORV virion, revealing how λ3 associates with the λ1 shell (10Zhang X. Walker S.B. Chipman P.R. Nibert M.L. Baker T.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 1011-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These studies leave μ2 as the only core protein for which no crystal structure is yet available (Table I). The roles of μ2 in core functions are also poorly defined. Cores catalyze at least five different enzymatic reactions (Table I). In addition to the polymerase activity attributable to λ3, there are the four reactions in RNA 5′ capping: RNA 5′- triphosphatase (RTPase), guanylyltransferase, 7N-methyltransferase, and 2′O-methyltransferase (3Yue Z. Shatkin A.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 233: 31-56PubMed Google Scholar, 11Furuichi Y. Muthukrishnan S. Tomasz J. Shatkin A.J. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1976; 19: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The RTPase activity has been assigned to the shell protein λ1 (12Bisaillon M. Lemay G. J. Biol.

Cores also catalyze removal of the γ-phosphate group from NTPs (21Borsa J. Grover J. Chapman J.D. J. Virol. 1970; 6: 295-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kapuler A.M. Mendelsohn N. Klett H.

Virol. 1996; 70: 6162-6168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but might alternatively reflect a distinct activity not encompassed by the five reactions above. In fact, published findings suggest there may be two different types of nonspecific nucleoside triphosphatases (NTPases) in cores (23Noble S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Noble S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7728-7735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of these NTPases might represent a core-associated RNA helicase that is involved in melting the double-stranded RNA genome segments during transcription (23Noble S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Noble S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7728-7735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Bisaillon M. Bergeron J. Lemay G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18298-18303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and indeed evidence for NTP-dependent RNA/DNA helicase activity by shell protein λ1 has been reported (30Bisaillon M. Bergeron J. Lemay G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18298-18303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Two previous genetic studies have implicated μ2 in the enzymatic activities of cores. Yin et al. (31Yin P. Cheang M. Coombs K.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1223-1227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) show that the M1 genome segment, which encodes μ2, determines in vitro differences between cores of mORV strains type 1 Lang (T1L) and type 3 Dearing (T3D) in both the temperature optimum of transcription and the amounts of transcripts produced. Because λ3 is the viral polymerase (6Drayna D. Fields B.N. J. Virol. 1982; 41: 110-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Morozov S.Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5394Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8Starnes M.C. Joklik W.K. Virology. 1993; 193: 356-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 9Tao Y. Farsetta D.L. Nibert M.L. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2002; 111: 733-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), these genetic findings suggest an auxiliary role for μ2 in λ3 function. Noble and Nibert (24Noble S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7728-7735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) show that M1/μ2 determines in vitro differences between T1L and T3D cores in both the response of the ATPase activities to temperature and the rate of GTP hydrolysis at certain conditions. The latter genetic associations are consistent with μ2 functioning as an NTPase or playing a regulatory role in the NTPase function of another core protein, most likely λ1 (23Noble S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Noble S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7728-7735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Bisaillon M. Bergeron J. Lemay G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18298-18303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Both μ2 and λ1 in vitro have also been shown to bind RNA (32Bisaillon M. Lemay G. Virus Res. 1997; 51: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 33Brentano L. Noah D.L. Brown E.G. Sherry B. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8354-8357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lemay G. Danis C. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 3261-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, questions remain about the relative roles of μ2 and λ1 in the NTPase activities of cores and the specific roles each plays in viral mRNA synthesis. Recent studies have used immunofluorescence microscopy to identify in vivo associations between μ2 and other proteins. Initially, μ2 was shown to associate with and stabilize microtubules in both infected and transfected cells (35Parker J.S.L. Broering T.J. Kim J. Higgins D.E. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4483-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Subsequently, μ2 was shown to associate also with the major mORV nonstructural protein μNS (36Broering T.J. Parker J.S.L. Joyce P.L. Kim J. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 2002; : 8285-8297Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These findings suggest important roles for μ2 and μNS in building the cytoplasmic “factories” in which viral genome replication and assembly are thought to occur (35Parker J.S.L. Broering T.J. Kim J. Higgins D.E. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4483-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 36Broering T.J. Parker J.S.L. Joyce P.L. Kim J. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 2002; : 8285-8297Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 37Becker M.M. Goral M.I. Hazelton P.R. Baer G.S. Rodgers S.E. Brown E.G. Coombs K.M. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1459-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 38Mbisa J.L. Becker M.M. Zou S. Dermody T.S. Brown E.G. Virology. 2000; 272: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To learn more about the activities of μ2, we devised a purification protocol and undertook functional studies of the purified protein. Results in this report provide biochemical and genetic evidence that μ2 is itself a divalent cation-dependent NTPase and RTPase. Alanine substitutions in a putative nucleotide binding region of μ2 abrogated both functions but did not substantially affect the purification profile of the protein or its known associations with microtubules and μNS protein in vivo. In vitro microtubule binding by purified μ2 was also demonstrated and not affected by the mutations. Purified μ2 was further demonstrated to interact in vitro with the viral polymerase, λ3, and the presence of λ3 mildly stimulated the triphosphatase activities of μ2. These findings suggest that μ2 is an enzymatic component of the mORV core and may contribute several possible functions to viral mRNA synthesis. Generation of a Recombinant Baculovirus for Expression of Wild-type (wt) μ2—Generation of plasmid pBS-M1(T1L), encoding wt T1L μ2 protein, was previously described (35Parker J.S.L. Broering T.J. Kim J. Higgins D.E. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4483-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The complete μ2-encoding region was excised from this plasmid by digestion with BamHI and HindIII and ligated into the pFastBac vector (Invitrogen) under transcriptional control of the baculovirus (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus) polyhedrin promoter. The resulting plasmid pFB-M1(T1L) was used to generate a recombinant baculovirus with the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen). This baculovirus was amplified into high titer stocks by serial passage in Spodoptera frugiperda 21 cells (Sf21 cells). Generation of a Recombinant Baculovirus for Expression of Mutant K415A/K419A μ2—To obtain an M1 gene encoding alanine substitutions for lysines 415 and 419 in μ2, we first removed the BamHI site from the multiple-cloning region of pBS-M1(T1L) by cutting with BamHI, filling the overhangs with Klenow polymerase, and religating. The resulting plasmid pBS′-M1(T1L) was used as template in an inverse polymerase chain reaction with forward primer 5′-GGGGATCCTTTGCATCAACAATTATGAGAGTTC-3′ and reverse primer 5′- GGGGATCCCGCAGGCAGCACAGCGCC-3′ (bold italics indicate nucleotide changes for Ala-419 and Ala-415, respectively). In each primer one silent nucleotide change was also introduced to generate a BamHI site (underlined) without affecting the μ2 amino acid sequence. The amplification conditions were the same as those described in Kim et al. (39Kim J. Zhang X. Centonze V.E. Bowman V.D. Noble S. Baker T.S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12211-12222Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was subjected to nucleotide sequencing to confirm that between the BsmI and SphI sites in M1, and the BsmI-SphI fragment was then swapped for the same region of pBS-M1(T1L). The XbaI-HindIII fragment from the resulting plasmid pBS-M1(T1L)K415A/K419A was swapped for the same region of pFB-M1(T1L). The resulting plasmid pFB-M1(T1L)K415A/K419A was used to generate a recombinant baculovirus as indicated in the preceding section. Cloning M1 Genes into the pCI-neo Vector—Generation of plasmid pCI-M1(T1L), encoding wt T1L μ2 protein, was previously described (35Parker J.S.L. Broering T.J. Kim J. Higgins D.E. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4483-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The plasmid pCI-M1(T1L)K415A/K419A was generated in the same manner in that the M1 gene from pBS-M1(T1L)K415A/K419A was excised by digestion with SpeI and XhoI and ligated into the pCI-neo vector (Promega) that had been digested with NheI and SalI. Purification of wt and K415A/K419A μ2—Sf21 cells were prepared in a 1-liter spinner at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml, into which the recombinant baculovirus to express either wt or K415A/K419A μ2 was inoculated at 5–10 plaque-forming units/cell. At 60 h post-infection, the cells were harvested and washed 3 times with cold phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5). Nuclear extracts were then prepared from these cells as follows. The cell pellet was washed twice with 50 ml of ice-cold Nonidet P-40 buffer and then twice with 50 ml of ice-cold CaCl2 buffer. To make the Nonidet P-40 and CaCl2 buffers 100 ml of Chelsky buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 30 mm sucrose) was supplemented with Nonidet P-40 to 0.5% or CaCl2 to 10 mm. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)). Nuclei were lysed on ice with a syringe, and the nucleoplasm was separated from the postnuclear pellet by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min in an RC-5B centrifuge with an SS34 rotor (DuPont Sorvall). The nucleoplasm was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against A0 buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol). All subsequent column work was performed at room temperature with an Akta-FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). At each step the column fractions containing μ2 were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with μ2-specific polyclonal antiserum (36Broering T.J. Parker J.S.L. Joyce P.L. Kim J. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 2002; : 8285-8297Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and an alkaline phosphatase-based color detection method (39Kim J. Zhang X. Centonze V.E. Bowman V.D. Noble S. Baker T.S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12211-12222Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The dialyzed nucleoplasm was applied to a 5-ml HiTrap DEAE-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) preequilibrated with A0 buffer. μ2 was eluted from this column at ∼100 mm NaCl in a 0–1 m NaCl gradient in A0 buffer as identified. The fractions containing μ2 were pooled, mixed 1:1 with A0 buffer, and applied to a 1-ml HiTrap Blue (Cibacron Blue)-agarose column (Amersham Biosciences) preequilibrated with A50 buffer (A0 buffer supplemented with 50 mm NaCl). μ2 eluted from this column at 0.8–1.2 m NaCl in a 0–2 m NaCl gradient in A0 buffer. The fractions containing μ2 were pooled, dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against A0 buffer, and applied to a 1-ml HiTrap heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) preequilibrated with A50 buffer. μ2 eluted from this column at ∼200 mm NaCl in a 0–1 m NaCl gradient in A0 buffer. The fractions containing μ2 were pooled, dialyzed against A100 buffer (A0 buffer supplemented with 100 mm NaCl), and used for all subsequent work as purified μ2. Protein concentration was estimated from absorbance at 280 nm. Yields from this procedure were routinely in the range of 300– 400 μg of μ2 per 4 × 108 cells. Purification of wt λ3 Protein—The T3D λ3 protein was expressed and purified as previously described (9Tao Y. Farsetta D.L. Nibert M.L. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2002; 111: 733-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Immediately before use in each experiment, λ3 (or bovine serum albumin used in parallel samples) was dialyzed against A100 buffer for 2 h at 4 °C using a Slide-A-Lyzer 10K cassette (Pierce). NTPase Assays—Reactions for analysis in the colorimetric NTPase assay were performed in A100 buffer lacking β-mercaptoethanol. The reactions also contained 2 mm ATP and the indicated amount(s) of protein(s) in a total reaction volume of 60 μl. For some experiments ingredients were altered as specifically described in the figure legends. After incubation at room temperature for an appropriate time (standard, 45 min), the reaction was stopped with 60 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. 100 μl of the stopped reaction was then mixed with 100 μl of colorimetric reagent prepared by mixing 6 n sulfuric acid, 0.8% ammonium molybdate, and 10% ascorbic acid in a 1:3:1 ratio. This mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and absorbance at 655 nm (A655) was measured with a microplate colorimeter (Molecular Devices). Standard curves generated with a dilution series of KH2PO4 were used to convert the A655 values to amounts of inorganic phosphate (Pi) released (23Noble S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the radiographic NTPase assay reaction conditions were the same as for the colorimetric assay except that the reaction volume was only 20 μl, and 5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used instead of 2 mm ATP. After incubating at room temperature for 30 min, the reaction was stopped with 10 mm EDTA. 1 μl of the stopped reaction was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plate (EM Science). After drying the TLC plate was developed in 1.2 m LiCl solvent, and the separated reaction products were visualized by either phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics) or exposure to x-ray film (Fuji or Kodak) in the presence of an intensifying screen. RTPase Assay—MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit (Ambion) was used to generate γ-labeled 45-nucleotide RNA substrates following the manufacturer's directions. Each 20-μl reaction mixture contained 30 units of T7 RNA polymerase (from the kit), 1× transcription buffer (from the kit), 1 mm ATP, 1 mm CTP, 1 mm UTP, 0.03 mm GTP, 50 μCi of either [γ-32P]GTP (6000 Ci/mmol) or [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer), 1 μg of pGEM-4Z (Promega) (linearized with SmaI and purified from an agarose gel), and 1 unit/μl RNasin (Promega). After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C the reaction was adjusted to 50 μl with H2O. Template DNA was degraded by treatment for 30 min at 37 °C with 2 units of DNase I (from the kit). Free nucleotides were removed with a nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen) and then a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences). The quality and purity of the purified 45-mer [γ-32P]- or [α-32P]RNA (i.e. appropriate RNA size and essential absence of [γ-32P]- or [α-32P]RNA and small abortive transcripts) were verified on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea (data not shown). Efficient removal of GTP and small abortive transcripts from the [γ-32P]RNA was also verified by TLC, in which [γ-32P]GTP was found to migrate slightly faster than the upper spot of the radiolabeled RNA (data not shown). RNA concentration was estimated by absorbance at 260 nm. For the RTPase assay reaction conditions were the same as for the radiographic NTPase assay except that specified amounts of 32P-labeled RNA were added instead of ATP. After incubating for the appropriate time at room temperature (standard, 1 h), the reaction was stopped with 10 mm EDTA. For Fig. 6, RNAs were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea and then visualized by exposure to x-ray film in the presence of an intensifying screen. Otherwise, reaction products were separated by TLC as described for the radiographic NTPase assay and visualized by phosphorimaging. For quantitation from TLC, the intensity of the 32Pi spot obtained in each μ2- and/or λ3-containing sample was expressed as a fraction of that obtained by treatment of the RNA with calf intestinal phosphatase (New England Biolabs). The upper spot attributable to substrate RNA in the TLC plates (see Fig. 7, A and C, for results with [γ-32P]RNA substrate) was unexpected, suggesting that despite the purification steps and tests of purity described in the preceding section, the samples might be contaminated with GTP. However, the [α-32P]RNA substrate was identically resolved into two spots by TLC, the upper of which was not abolished by prior treatment of the sample with calf intestinal phosphatase (data not shown), demonstrating that the upper spot is indeed attributable to RNA, not GTP.Fig. 7RTPase activity of wt μ2 examined by TLC and stimulation by λ3. Release of 32P-labeled Pi from [γ-32P]GTP-labeled 45-mer RNA was visualized by phosphorimaging after separation of reaction products by TLC. Test samples contained 0.12 pmol of μ2 protein unless otherwise stated. A, levels of RTPase activity by wt μ2 were determined in the presence of increasing concentrations of substrate RNA (0, 0.04, 0.12, 0.2, or 0.4 μm) (lanes 3–7). Control samples containing no μ2 (lane 1), wt μ2 in the presence of 10 mm EDTA (lane 8), or K415A/K419A (K415/9A) μ2 (lane 9), each with 0.4 μm substrate RNA, were also analyzed. A control sample containing 0.4 μm substrate RNA and 3 units of calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) (lane 2) was included to demonstrate complete release of the 32P-labeled γ-phosphate. ori, sample origins. B, indicated concentrations of substrate RNA were tested for effects on the RTPase activity of wt μ2. Initial velocities (V0) were determined from time points within the linear range of each reaction time course. C, levels of RTPase activity by wt μ2 were determined in the presence of 0.4 μm substrate RNA and either 0 or 0.42 pmol of λ3 protein (lanes 3 and 4). Control samples containing no μ2 or λ3 (lane 1) or 0.42 pmol of λ3 but no μ2 (lane 5), each with 0.4 μm substrate RNA, were also analyzed. A calf intestinal phosphatase control was include"

https://openalex.org/W2083175755,"Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) has been suggested to be involved in tumor metastasis. However, the molecular mechanism of LMP1-induced metastasis is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of LMP1 on the expression of RECK, a metastasis suppressor gene, in an EBV-negative nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell line. Our data demonstrated that LMP1 induced downregulation of RECK via transcription repression in TW04 cells. In addition, we found that LMP1 acted via an Sp1 site to inhibit RECK promoter activity. We next studied the signaling pathway that mediated the effect of LMP1 on RECK expression. Our results showed that LMP1 potently stimulated the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and inhibition of ERK activity by PD98059 antagonized LMP1-induced downregulation of RECK. Conversely, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor SP600125 and p38HOG kinase inhibitor SB203580 had little effect. We also found that the expression of LMP1 increased the invasive ability of TW04 cells. The importance of RECK in LMP1-induced invasiveness was supported by three observations. First, restoration of RECK expression by PD98059 reduced LMP1-induced release of active MMP-9. Second, suppression of PD98059-induced RECK expression by small interference RNA abolished the inhibitory action of PD98059 on LMP1-induced invasiveness. Third, coexpression of RECK with LMP1 in TW04 cells effectively suppressed cell invasiveness induced by LMP1. Taken together, these results suggest that LMP1 inhibits RECK expression via the ERK/Sp1 signaling pathway and this inhibition is a critical step for LMP1-induced tumor metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W1980036183,"A novel mechanism of phagocytic recognition of apoptotic cells was found and characterized. Jurkat cells incubated with appropriate concentrations of etoposide or anti-Fas antibody transiently became susceptible to binding and phagocytosis by THP-1 cell-derived macrophages at 2 h. The bound Jurkat cells showed no chromatin condensation, but the binding was prevented by a caspase inhibitor, indicating that they were recognized at an early stage of apoptosis. The ligands recognized on the apoptotic cells were sialylpolylactosaminyl sugar chains because 1) the binding was inhibited by an oligosaccharide preparation of erythrocyte membrane, and its inhibitory activity was destroyed by polylactosaminoglycan-specific endo-β-galactosidase or neuraminidase; 2) Jurkat cells pretreated with endo-β-galactosidase or neuraminidase failed to be recognized; and 3) treatment of the apoptotic cells with polylactosaminoglycan-binding <i>Datura stramonium</i> agglutinin prevented recognition. The sialylpolylactosaminyl chains involved were most likely those of a major sialoglycoprotein CD43 because anti-CD43 antibody inhibited recognition. CD43 on apoptotic Jurkat cells was found to form a cap at 2 h, and the cap disappeared at 4 h. This transient capping of CD43 coincided with the transient increase in the susceptibility of the cells to macrophage recognition, suggesting that CD43 capping is responsible for generation of the carbohydrate ligands for recognition. Furthermore, microscopic observation suggested that the apoptotic cells were recognized at the CD43 cap. Taken together, we conclude that apoptotic Jurkat cells transiently undergo CD43 capping at an early stage of apoptosis and are recognized by macrophages through the cluster of sialylpolylactosaminyl chains of the capped CD43."

https://openalex.org/W2030474009,"Recently, human artificial chromosomes featuring functional centromeres have been generated efficiently from naked synthetic alphoid DNA containing CENP-B boxes as a de novo mechanism in a human cultured cell line, but not from the synthetic alphoid DNA only containing mutations within CENP-B boxes, indicating that CENP-B has some functions in assembling centromere/kinetochore components on alphoid DNA. To investigate whether any interactions exist between CENP-B and the other centromere proteins, we screened a cDNA library by yeast two-hybrid analysis. An interaction between CENP-B and CENP-C was detected, and the CENP-C domains required were determined to overlap with three Mif2 homologous regions, which were also revealed to be involved in the CENP-C assembly of centromeres by expression of truncated polypeptides in cultured cells. Overproduction of truncated CENP-B containing no CENP-C interaction domains caused abnormal duplication of CENP-C domains at G2 and cell cycle delay at metaphase. These results suggest that the interaction between CENP-B and CENP-C may be involved in the correct assembly of CENP-C on alphoid DNA. In other words, a possible molecular linkage may exist between one of the kinetochore components and human centromere DNA through CENP-B/CENP-B box interaction.

In other words, a possible molecular linkage may exist between one of the kinetochore components and human centromere DNA through CENP-B/CENP-B box interaction. The centromere is an essential region responsible for proper segregation of chromosomes. A pair of trilaminar structures called kinetochores are formed on the sides of centromeres in mitotic chromosomes, attach to spindle microtubules, and control the timing of sister chromatid dissociation. On human chromosomes, centromere/kinetochore-specific proteins, CENP-A, CENP-B, and CENP-C, were first identified with anti-centromere antibodies existing in autoimmune patient sera (1Earnshaw W.C. Rothfield N. Chromosoma. 1985; 91: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). These proteins exist at the centromere constitutively throughout the cell cycle. Recently, other constitutive centromere proteins, CENP-H, hMis6(CENP-I), and hMis12, have been identified (2Sugata N. Li S. Earnshaw W.C. Yen T.J. Yoda K. Masumoto H. Munekata E. Warburton P.E.

CENP-A has a histone fold domain similar to histone H3 at its carboxyl terminus and a unique amino-terminal region (5Sullivan K.F. Hechenberger M. Masri K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). It is co-purified with nucleosomes, and an in vitro assembly analysis indicated that histone H3 could be replaced with CENP-A in these structures (6Palmer D.K. O'Day K. Wener M.H. Andrews B.S.

Thus, CENP-A is a centromere-specific histone H3 found to be conserved in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, mice, and humans (8Buchwitz B.R.

CENP-A knockout mouse embryos die before day 6.5. In CENP-A-depleted mouse cells, CENP-C can be detected on whole nuclei and CENP-B localization becomes diffuse (14Howman E.V. Fowler K.J. Newson A.J.

CENP-A is present on active centromeres and neocentromere regions, but not on inactive centromeres or on dicentric chromosomes (15Saffery R. Irvine D.V. Griffiths B. Kalitsis P. Wordeman L. Choo K.H.

Tomkiel J. Cooke C.A. Ratrie III, H. Maurer M. Rothfield N.F. Earnshaw W.C. Cell. 1992; 70: 115-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Microinjection of an anti-CENP-C antibody into cells resulted in cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and a reduction in the kinetochore size (18Tomkiel J. Cooke C.A. Saitoh H. Bernat R.L. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 531-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). CENP-C, conserved in C. elegans, chickens, mice, and humans, has similarity with Mif2, a homologue in budding yeast, in its central and carboxyl-terminal domains (19Brown M.T. Goetsch L. Hartwell L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 23: 387-403Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 20Brown M.T. Gene. 1995; 160: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 21Fukagawa T. Brown W.R. Hum. Mol.

CENP-C has been reported to have DNA binding activity in its central region, but this has no sequence specificity (25Sugimoto K. Yata H. Muro Y. Himeno M. J. Biochem.

Two centromere-targeting regions have been reported, one overlapping with the DNA binding domain and the other with the COOH-terminal region (26Yang C.H. Tomkiel J. Saitoh H. Johnson D.H.

CENP-C knockout mouse embryos lived only 3.5 days and suffered mortality as a result of mis-segregation of chromosomes (29Kalitsis P. Fowler K.J. Earle E. Hill J. Choo K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1136-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). CENP-C-depleted nuclei from chicken DT-40 cells showed cell cycle arrest at the metaphase/anaphase transition and death by apoptosis, further indicating that CENP-C is essential for chromosome segregation and cell viability (21Fukagawa T. Brown W.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 2301-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In DT-40 cells, both CENP-H and the Mis6 homologue CENP-I were demonstrated to be necessary for the localization of CENP-C (30Fukagawa T. Mikami Y. Nishihashi A. Regnier V. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y.

Fukagawa T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 463-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, in HeLa cells, CENP-C was demonstrated to be localized at the kinetochore independent of the hMis12 and hMis6(CENP-I) assemblies (3Goshima G. Kiyomitsu T. Yoda K. Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 25-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Thus, it is still unclear why these centromere-specific constitutive components assemble at α satellite regions of human chromosomes, except for CENP-B.CENP-B binds to a specific 17-bp sequence called the CENP-B box in centromere-specific α satellite (alphoid) DNA in humans and in minor satellite DNA in mice, via its amino-terminal DNA binding domain and forms a homodimer with another carboxyl terminus (32Kitagawa K.

CENP-B exists at both active and inactive centromeres on dicentric chromosomes but does not exist at centromeres on the Y chromosome or neocentromeres (15Saffery R. Irvine D.V. Griffiths B. Kalitsis P. Wordeman L. Choo K.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 37Earnshaw W.C. Ratrie III, H. Stetten G. Chromosoma. 1989; 98: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). CENP-B is highly conserved between mice and humans (38Sullivan K.F. Glass C.A. Chromosoma. 1991; 100: 360-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In S. pombe, three CENP-B homologues, Abp1, Cbh1, and Cbh2, have also been identified (39Irelan J.T. Gutkin G.I. Clarke L. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1191-1203PubMed Google Scholar, 40Murakami Y. Huberman J.A. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast to CENP-A and CENP-C, CENP-B null mice were viable (41Hudson D.F. Fowler K.J. Earle E. Saffery R. Kalitsis P. Trowell H. Hill J. Wreford N.G. de Kretser D.M. Cancilla M.R. Howman E.

Therefore, CENP-B might not be essential for kinetochore function itself, but its significance remains to be elucidated.Recently, mammalian artificial chromosomes have been generated efficiently from naked genomic alphoid DNA and a synthetic alphoid DNA containing CENP-B boxes as a de novo mechanism in a human cultured cell line, but not from alphoid DNA lacking CENP-B boxes or from synthetic alphoid DNA only containing point mutations within the CENP-B boxes (45Harrington J.J.

On these artificial chromosomes, CENP-A, CENP-B, CENP-C, and CENP-E assemble like functional centromeres on normal human chromosomes. Mammalian artificial chromosomes are maintained stably through cell divisions (46Ikeno M. Grimes B. Okazaki T. Nakano M. Saitoh K. Hoshino H. McGill N.I. Cooke H. Masumoto H. Nat.

These data indicate that the CENP-B/CENP-B box interaction has some crucial roles for assembling other essential centromere/kinetochore components on the naked alphoid DNA.The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether any interactions exist between CENP-B and the other centromere proteins. Using yeast two-hybrid analysis, interactions between CENP-B and CENP-C were detected and the required CENP-C domains were determined to overlap with three Mif2 homologous regions. Overproduction of CENP-B without the CENP-C interaction domains caused abnormal assembly of CENP-C at G2 and cell cycle delay at metaphase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of CENP-A and CENP-C—The CENP-A gene was cloned by PCR with two sets of primers for amplifying base pairs 1-159 and 160-420: CNPAN (5′-ATAGTCGACCATGGGCCCGCGCCGCCGGA-3′), CNPA-HinC (5′-CTGAAGCTTTCGGATCTCCTTTAG-3′), CNPA-HinN (5′-CTAAAGGAGATCCGAAAGCTTCAG3′), and CNPAC (5′-ATAGGATCCTCAGCCTCAGCCGAGTCCCTCCTC-3′). PCR was performed using a human HeLa S3 5′-STRETCH PLUS cDNA library (Clontech) and TaKaRa Taq (TaKaRa).The CENP-C gene was cloned with screening of a human HeLa S3 5′-STRETCH PLUS cDNA library probed with the PCR product CENP-C2185-2847. CENP-C1-850 was cloned by PCR with the cDNA library and TaKaRa Ex Taq (TaKaRa). All cloned DNAs were sequenced with an AutoRead sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) and a dRhodamine dye terminator kit (Applied Biosystems) following the protocol from the manufacturer.Construction of Plasmids—pLexACB132-599, pLexACB132-556, pLexACB132-366, pGADCB132-366, and pGADCB368-599 was described previously (32Kitagawa K.

The PCR product was cloned into pGADGH. pLexACENP-A and pGADCENP-A were constructed by the introduction of full-length CENP-A into pBTM116 and pGADGH. To construct pRFPCENP-C, full-length CENP-C was cloned into pDsRED-C1 (Clontech).

Searle P.F. Chen H.Y. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7318-7322Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and pETCBN-160 (32Kitagawa K. Masumoto H. Ikeda M. Okazaki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1602-1612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To construct pMTCB1-160c, pMTID 13S was treated with SalI, the Klenow fragment, and HindIII. The N-terminal fragment of CENP-B was excised from pETCBN-160 by treatment with NcoI, the Klenow fragment, and BamHI. For the T7 tag, two oligonucleotides (5′-GATCCATGGCTAGCATGACTGGTGGACAGCAAATGGGTCGGTAGTCGACA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTGTCGACTACCGACCCATTTGCTGTCCACCAGTCATGCTAGCCATG-3′) were annealed and the fragments were cloned into enzyme-treated pMTID 13S. To construct pMTCB1-561c, pETCENP-B (32Kitagawa K. Masumoto H. Ikeda M. Okazaki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1602-1612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was treated with XhoI and KpnI. For the KpnI-BamHI linker KB21 (5′-GATCCGAAGGAGGTCAGGTAC-3′) and KB13 (5′-CTGACCTCCTTCG-3′) were annealed and cloned into pMTCB1-160c treated with XhoI and BamHI. To construct pMTCENP-B, CENP-B1672-1800 was amplified by Pfu polymerase with 1672K (5′-GAGGTACCTGACCTCCTTCC-3′) and 1800B (5′-GTGGATCCGCTTTGATGTCC-3′). CENP-B XhoI-KpnI fragment and PCR products treated with KpnI and BamHI were cloned into pMTCB1-160c treated with XhoI and BamHI.Two-hybrid Analysis—Yeast transformation and β-galactosidase assays were performed according to the procedure of Kitagawa et al. (32Kitagawa K. Masumoto H. Ikeda M. Okazaki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1602-1612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For screening, 25 μg of a mouse testis cDNA library in pGADGH was transformed into yeast strain L40 containing LexACB132-599. Yeast cells corresponding to 5 × 106 transformants were plated onto Yc/THULL plates (-Trp/-His/-Ura/-Lys/-Leu) containing 50 mm 3-aminotriazole to screen for transcriptional activation of the HIS3 gene. After incubation for 3 days at 30 °C, yeast colonies were isolated and streaked on Yc/UTL plates (-Trp/-Ura/-Leu) to obtain single colonies. Three colonies were analyzed using a β-galactosidase filter assay.Isolation of HeLa Nuclei and Preparation of Soluble Chromatin—90% confluent HeLa cells were washed twice with PBS 1The abbreviations used are: PBSphosphate-buffered salineDTTdithiothreitolRFPred fluorescent proteinDAPI4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleBSAbovine serum albumin. and once with isolation buffer (3.75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05 mm spermine, 0.125 mm spermidine, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm KCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT, 40 μm z-Leu-Leu-Leu-H aldehyde (Peptide Institute, Japan)). Isolation buffer containing 0.1% digitonin (Wako) was then added with incubation on ice for 10 min. Cells were collected with a cell scraper, centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min at 1,000 rpm with an RL-131 (Tomy), and suspended in isolation buffer containing 0.1% digitonin before homogenization with a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C for 5 min at 1,000 rpm, re-suspended in wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm KCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT, 40 μm z-Leu-Leu-Leu-H aldehyde) at 1 × 108 nuclei/ml, and transferred to 1.5-ml tubes. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 3,000 rpm with an MRX-150 (Tomy) and re-suspended in buffer A (5 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1.5 μm aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 mm DTT, 40 μm z-Leu-Leu-Leu-H aldehyde). Nuclei were collected by centrifugation and re-suspended again with buffer A containing 1 mm CaCl2. Microccocal nuclease (Amersham Biosciences) was added to 200 units/ml, followed by incubation for 5 min at 37 °C. The enzyme reaction was stopped by adding EGTA to 2 mm, and the supernatant suspension was recovered by centrifugation at 4 °C for 5 min at 8,000 rpm. After precipitation in buffer A containing 2 mm EGTA and sonication with a Sonifier 450 (Branson), the supernatant was recovered by centrifugation at 4 °C for 5 min at 8,000 rpm.Immunoprecipitation with Anti-CENP Antibodies—Aliquots of 150 μl of soluble chromatin were transferred to siliconized tubes and mixed with 150 μl of 2× IP buffer (55 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 600 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 1.5 μm aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 mm DTT, 40 μm z-Leu-Leu-Leu-H aldehyde, 0.2% Nonidet P-40). Antibodies against CENP-A, -B, and -C were added, and samples were rotated at 4 °C for 16 h. Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) or Dynabeads M-280 sheep anti-mouse IgG (Dynal) were washed twice with IP buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 1.5 μm aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 mm DTT, 40 μm z-Leu-Leu-Leu-H aldehyde, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), blocked with IP buffer containing 5% BSA at 4 °C for 30 min, added to samples, and rotated for 1 h. Sepharose was collected by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 1 min and washed five times with IP buffer. The magnetic Dynabeads were collected with Dynal MPC-M (Dynal) for 1min and washed five times with IP buffer. Beads were suspended in SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min before electrophoresis.In Vitro Transcription and Translation of CENP-B and CENP-C Polypeptides—Polypeptides of full-size CENP-B (CB1-599), CB1-160, or CENP-C were generated by in vitro transcription and translation with pETCENP-B, pETCBN-160 or pETCENP-C, respectively, in a TnT-coupled wheat germ extract system (Promega) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. To generate and solubilize polypeptides of CENP-B and CB1-160, linearized plasmid DNAs (0.25 μg) and annealed 29-bp oligonucleotide DNA containing a CENP-B box (CB29) (34Muro Y. Masumoto H. Yoda K. Nozaki N. Ohashi M. Okazaki T. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) were added to 25 μl of the reaction lysate. Ten μl of each polypeptide was mixed in IP (150) buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 1.5 μm aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 mm DTT, 40 μm z-Leu-Leu-Leu-H aldehyde, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) for immunoprecipitation analysis.Isolation of Cell Lines Expressing CENP-B Polypeptides—To establish cell lines expressing the CENP-B N-terminal polypeptide (CB1-160) or CENP-B (CB1-599), HeLa cells were transfected with pMTCB1-160c and pSV2neo or pMTCENP-B and pSV2neo by co-precipitation with calcium phosphate, and resistant colonies were selected with 400 μg/ml Geneticin.Cell Cycle Analysis of Cells Expressing CENP-B Polypeptides—For synchronization, CB1-160-expressing cells were treated with 2.5 mm thymidine for 20 h, washed twice, and incubated for 10 h in the absence of the drug. Cells were then incubated in the presence of 5 μg/ml aphidicolin for 20 h. After its removal, 0.6 μm cadmium chloride was added to the medium. Cells were harvested every 1 and 4 h, fixed onto coverslips, and stained with DAPI, and then the mitotic cells were counted. To analyze the cell cycle of CB1-561-expressing cells, 293S cells were transfected with pMTCENP-B or pMTCB1-561c by co-precipitation with calcium phosphate. At 1.5 and 2.5 days following the induction of the polypeptides, cells were fixed and indirect immunofluorescent staining was performed. To determine the cell cycle of these polypeptide-expressing cells, nuclei were counterstained with propidium iodide and the DNA content was measured with an IPLab (Signal Analytics Corp.).Transfection of Expression Plasmids and Indirect Immunofluorescent Staining—To express RFP-CENP-C deletion mutants, tetON HeLa (Clontech) cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips and transfected with Polyfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) using the protocol from the manufacturer for HeLa cells. Cells were fixed with 75% acetone at -20 °C for 30 min. The cells were then fixed again with periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 30 min, and finally washed three times in PBS for 5 min. Monoclonal anti-CENP-B (2D8D8), monoclonal anti-T7tag (Novagen) or guinea pig polyclonal anti-CENP-C antibodies were applied to the coverslips for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by washing three times in PBS for 5min each. Fluorescein isothiocyanate- or rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-guinea pig IgG antibodies in PBS containing 0.2% BSA and 0.2% skim milk were then applied to the coverslips for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing three times in PBS for 5 min each, the coverslips were stained with 1 μg/ml DAPI in PBS for 5 min and rinsed again in PBS. Samples were finally mounted and analyzed using a Zeiss microscope equipped with a Photometrics cooled CCD camera (PXL 1400-C1) coupled to an image analysis system (IPLab, Signal Analytics Corp.). In Figs. 8, 9, 10, images were taken at 0.2-μm z-steps using Zeiss microscope equipped with a cooled CCD camera (MicroMax, Princeton Instruments) coupled to MetaMorph (Universal Imaging) and used to produce deconvolved reconstructions of the image stacks with AutoDeblur (AutoQuant Imaging). Images are presented as maximum intensity projections. In Fig. 7B and 9B, z-stack images were processed with HazeBuster (VayTek).Fig. 9Intracellular localization of CENP-C and CENP-E in cells expressing the CB1-160 polypeptide.A, a normal 293S cell and a 293S cell expressing the CB1-160 polypeptide in mitosis were stained with DAPI, BN1, anti-T7 tag, and CGP2.

https://openalex.org/W2118379346,"We have investigated the role of endothelial cells in the metabolism of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), a vasoactive mediator synthesized from arachidonic acid by cytochrome P450 ω-oxidases. Porcine coronary artery endothelial cells (PCEC) incorporated 20-[3H]HETE primarily into the sn-2 position of phospholipids through a coenzyme A-dependent process. The incorporation was reduced by equimolar amounts of arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic or 8,9-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, but some uptake persisted even when a 10-fold excess of arachidonic acid was available. The retention of 20-[3H]HETE increased substantially when methyl arachidonoyl fluorophosphonate, but not bromoenol lactone, was added, suggesting that a Ca2+-dependent cytosolic phospholipase A2 released the 20-HETE contained in PCEC phospholipids. Addition of calcium ionophore A23187 produced a rapid release of 20-[3H]HETE from the PCEC, a finding that also is consistent with a Ca2+-dependent mobilization process. PCEC also converted 20-[3H]HETE to 20-carboxy-arachidonic acid (20-COOH-AA) and 18-, 16-, and 14-carbon β-oxidation products. 20-COOH-AA produced vasodilation in porcine coronary arterioles, but 20-HETE was inactive. These results suggest that the incorporation of 20-HETE and its subsequent conversion to 20-COOH-AA in the endothelium may be important in modulating coronary vascular function.

There is growing interest in 20-HETE because it increases systemic blood pressure, and animal studies indicate that it plays a key role in the pathophysiology of some experimental forms of hypertension (2.Capdevila J.H.

For example, the CYP4A2 gene is overexpressed during the development of hypertension in the SHR rat (9.Schwartzman M.L. da Silva J.L. Lin F. Nishimura M. Abraham N.G. Nephron. 1996; 73: 652-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and disruption of the CYP4a14 gene causes 20-HETE production and hypertension in male mice (10.Holla V.R. Adas F. Imig J.D.

Furthermore, treatment with an antisense oligonucleotide reduces CYP4A expression in the vasculature and lowers blood pressure (11.Wang M.H. Zhang F. Marji J. Zand B.A. Nasjletti A Laniado-Schwartzman M.L. Am. J.

Smooth muscle cells produce 20-HETE when small arteries are subjected to stretch or are exposed to biomediators like angiotensin II, endothelin or norepinephrine (6.Roman R.J. Physiol.

This depolarizes the membrane, causing Ca2+ influx and vasoconstriction (6.Roman R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 131-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that 20-HETE produces this effect by activating a receptor-dependent process mediated by the protein kinase C signal transduction pathway (16.Lange A. Gebremedhin D.

Science. 1991; 251: 799-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), which is incorporated into renal cortex phospholipids, especially the inositol phosphoglycerides (PI) (20.Carroll M.A. Balazy M. Huang D.D. Rybalova S. Falck J.R. McGiff J.C. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1696-1702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition to constricting renal preglomerular arterioles, 20-HETE is mitogenic, it affects ion transport mediated by the Na+/K+-ATPase and Na+/K+/2Cl–-cotransporter, and it mediates tubular-glomerular feedback (4.McGiff J.C. Quilley J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: R607-R623PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Roman R.J. Maier K.G. Sun C.-W. Harder D.R. Alonso-Galicia M. Clin. Exper. Pharmacol.

McGiff J.C. Med. Sci. Monitor. 2001; 7: 567-572PubMed Google Scholar). As opposed to its vasoconstrictor effect in the renal and cerebral circulation, 20-HETE acts as a vasodilator in the pulmonary and coronary circulations (22.Birks E.K. Bousamra K.M. Presberg K.

Hypertension. 1998; 31: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The pulmonary vasodilator effect is dependent on the presence of endothelium (22.Birks E.K. Bousamra K.M. Presberg K. Marsh J.A. Effros R.M. Jacobs E.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L823-L829PubMed Google Scholar), and the vasorelaxation produced by 20-HETE in the coronary artery is mediated by the release of prostacyclin (23.Pratt P.F. Falck J.R. Reddy J.M. Kurian J.B. Campbell W.B. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). 20-HETE also is converted to a bronchodilator substance by the pulmonary endothelial cyclooxygenase (24.Jacobs E.R. Effros R.M. Falck J.R. Reddy K.M. Campbell W.B. Zhu D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L280-L288PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to better understand the mechanism of these endothelium-dependent effects, we have investigated the utilization of 20-HETE in porcine coronary artery endothelial cells (PCEC), an experimental model that we have used previously for biochemical studies of eicosanoid metabolism (25.Weintraub N.L.

Lipid Mediat. 2003; 71: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To investigate the potential functional significance of these observations, we examined the vasoactivity of 20-HETE and 20-carboxy-arachidonic acid (20-COOH-AA), its main metabolite (19.Escalante B. Erlij D. Falck J.R. McGiff J.C. Science. 1991; 251: 799-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), in an isolated porcine coronary microvessel preparation. Synthesis of 20-[3H]HETE—20-[3H]HETE (16.7 μCi/nmol) was synthesized by incubating 15 nmol of arachidonic acid containing 250 μCi [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]arachidonic acid (60–100 Ci/mmol, American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., St. Louis, MO) with commercially available microsomes containing 30 pmol of baculovirus expressed human recombinant CYP4F3B, CYP reductase and cytochrome b5 isolated from BTI-TN-5B1–4 insect cells (Gentest, Woburn, MA). The mixture was incubated in 1 ml of 200 mm phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 μm bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1.3 mm NADP+, 3.3 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 3.3 mm MgCl2, 0.4 units of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 0.05 mm sodium citrate. After 1 h at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by addition of 1 ml H2O and formic acid to lower the pH to 4, and the lipids were extracted three-times with 8 ml of H2O-saturated ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate extracts were combined, dried under N2, suspended in 3 ml of acetonitrile, and separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a 5-μm 4.6 × 250 mm Discovery C18 column (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) and a dual pump gradient HPLC system (Gilson Medical Electronics, Inc., Middleton, WI) equipped with Model 306 pumps, a Model 117 Dual wavelength UV detector, a Model 231 XL automatic sample injector. The solvent system contained H2O adjusted to pH 4.0 with formic acid and an acetonitrile gradient that began at 30% and was increased to 57% acetonitrile at 30 min, to 65% over the next 20 min, to 100% over 5 min, and then maintained at 100% acetonitrile for 15 min. Fig. 1 shows the analysis of the radiolabeled material. The main product eluted from the reverse phase HPLC column 24 min before [3H]arachidonic acid (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, this product had the same retention time (RT), 33 min, as a commercially prepared 20-[14,15-3H]HETE standard (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Products, Boston, MA, 45 Ci/mmol, 97% purity by HPLC analysis). Product containing no radioactivity also was synthesized and isolated by HPLC. The HPLC eluate containing the main product was collected in 0.5 ml fractions and added to 2.5 ml chloroform-methanol (2:1, v/v), and the fractions were pooled. Phosphate-buffered saline was added, and the chloroform phase was separated and collected. After removal of the solvent under N2, the lipid extract was dissolved in acetonitrile and further separated by reverse phase HPLC with a solvent system consisting of H2O adjusted to pH 4.0 with formic acid and an acetonitrile gradient that increased from 30 to 100% over 70 min (29.Snyder G.D. Murali Krishna U. Falck J.R. Spector A.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H1936-H1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The product was collected, dried under N2, and analyzed by liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (27.Fang X. Kaduce T.L. Weintraub N.L. Harmon S. Teesch L.M. Morisseau C.

As shown in Fig. 1C, the mass spectrum contained a molecular ion at m/z 319 and ions at m/z 301 (M-H2O) and m/z 275 (M-CO2), consistent with the structure of 20-HETE. Synthesis of 20-COOH-AA—20-Hydroxy-5(Z),8(Z),11(Z),14(Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid (10 mg; 0.03 mmol) was dissolved in acetone (3 ml) and added dropwise with stirring to a –10 °C solution of Jones reagent (1.0 ml, 0.14 m solution in water) in acetone (3 ml) under an argon atmosphere (30.Manna S. Falck J.R. Chackos N. Capdevila J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1983; 24: 33-36Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was warmed to 0 °C over 30 min and then quenched with excess isopropyl alcohol. The precipitated chromium salts were removed by filtration, and the filter cake was washed with 5 ml of ethyl acetate. The combined filtrates were diluted with 5 ml of water and extracted three times with 5 ml of ethyl acetate. The combined organic extracts were washed twice with 5 ml of water, a NaCl solution (5 ml), dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by silica gel preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC), three elutions, with hexane/ethyl acetate (1:1) to give eicosa-5(Z),8(Z),11(Z),14(Z)-tetraen-1,20-dioic acid (6.9 mg, 74%, Rf = 0.15) as a colorless oil. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of the purified product (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 1.42-(q, J = 7.3 Hz, 2H), 1.62–1.80 (m, 4H), 2.04–2.20 (m, 4H), 2.32–2.42 (m, 4H), 2.78–2.90 (m, 6H), 5.30–5.50 (m, 8H). Cell Culture and Incubation—PCEC were isolated and grown in modified Medium 199 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (25.Weintraub N.L. Fang X. Kaduce T.L. VanRollins M. Chatterjee P.

Stocks were subcultured weekly by trypsinization, and cultures were used for experiments between passages 3 and 7. Confluent monolayers were incubated at 37 °C with 1 ml Medium 199 containing 0.1 μm BSA and 20-[3H]HETE in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The details concerning concentration of 20-[3H]HETE, time of incubation, and presence of other compounds are described in each experiment. The efflux of 20-HETE previously incorporated by the PCEC was investigated using a pulse-chase experimental design. PCEC cultures were incubated initially for 1 h with 20-[3H]HETE and after removal of this medium, the cells were washed and incubated for 20 min to 16 h in a culture medium containing BSA. Following incubation, the medium and cells were separated, and the lipid-soluble material was extracted and assayed for total radioactivity content. In some experiments, ionophore A23187 was added to determine whether activation of a calcium-mediated signaling pathway increased the efflux of 20-[3H]HETE from the PCEC (25.Weintraub N.L. Fang X.

In other experiments, either methyl arachidonoyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP) or bromoenol lactone (BEL), both obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), was added to investigate the role of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in mediating the efflux of 20-[3H]HETE from the cells. Assay of Incubation Medium—The amount of radioactivity remaining in the medium after incubation was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Lipids present in the medium were extracted twice with 4 ml of ice-cold ethyl acetate saturated with water. Extracts were combined, the ethyl acetate was evaporated under N2, and the lipids were dissolved in acetonitrile and separated by reverse-phase HPLC with the dual pump gradient system and Discovery C18 column. The solvent system contained H2O adjusted to pH 4.0 with formic acid and an acetonitrile gradient that increased from 30 to 100% over 70 min at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min (27.Fang X. Kaduce T.L. Weintraub N.L. Harmon S. Teesch L.M. Morisseau C. Thompson D.A. Hammock B.D. Spector A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14867-14874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was measured by combining the column effluent with scintillator solution and then passing the mixture through a flow scintillation detector (IN/US Systems, Inc., Tampa, FL). Analyses of Cell Lipids—After the medium was removed and the PCEC monolayer washed with ice-cold buffer, the lipids were extracted from the cells with 6 ml of chloroform-methanol (2:1, v/v). Phosphate-buffered saline, 1.5 ml containing 0.05 n HCl was added, the phases were separated, the chloroform was removed and dried under N2. The lipid residue was dissolved in 200 μl of chloroform-methanol, and an aliquot was dried under N2 and assayed for radioactivity in a liquid scintillation spectrometer (31.Fang X. Kaduce T.L. Weintraub N.L. VanRollins M. Spector A.A. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 784-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To determine the distribution of the radioactivity in the cell lipids, aliquots of the extract were separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on Whatman LK5D silica gel plates (Whatman Inc., Clifton, NJ) with a solvent system of chloroform-methanol-40% methylamine-H2O (60:36:1.5:1, v/v/v) (27.Fang X. Kaduce T.L. Weintraub N.L. Harmon S. Teesch L.M. Morisseau C. Thompson D.A. Hammock B.D. Spector A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14867-14874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The radioactivity contained in the separated lipids was determined with an AR-200 Imaging Scanner (Bioscan, Inc., Washington, D. C.). Phospholipid standards (Avanti Polar Lipids, (Naperville, IL) were added to each chromatogram, and the separated lipids were visualized by staining with 1-anilinonaphthalene 8-sulfonic acid. Studies also were done to determine the positional distribution of the radioactivity incorporated into the PCEC phospholipids (28.Fang X. Weintraub N.L. Spector A.A. Prost. Lipid Mediat. 2003; 71: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 32.Fang X. Kaduce T.L. Spector A.A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 699-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation with 20-[3H]HETE, the phospholipids contained in the cell lipid extract were separated by TLC as indicated above and each phospholipids fraction was extracted and suspended in 1 ml of phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 2 mm CaCl2. Snake venom PLA2 (obtained from Sigma, 125 units/ml) dissolved in this buffer solution was added, and the samples were sealed under N2 and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. The hydrolysates were extracted with chloroform-methanol (2:1 v/v), dried under N2, and fractionated by TLC using a solvent mixture containing chloroform, methanol, 40% methylamine, water (60:36:1.5: 1.0, v/v/v/v), and the distribution of radioactivity in the chromatogram was determined with the AR-200 Imaging Scanner. To determine whether the radioactivity incorporated in the PCEC lipids remained as 20-HETE or was converted to metabolites, additional aliquots of the cell extract were hydrolyzed for 1 h at 50 °C in 0.5 ml methanol containing 50 μl of 2 N NaOH (32.Fang X. Kaduce T.L. Spector A.A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 699-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the pH was adjusted to 7.0 with formic acid/H2O (1:10, v/v) and the volume adjusted to 1 ml with H2O, the hydrolyzed lipid products were extracted twice with 4 ml of ice-cold ethyl acetate saturated with H2O. The ethyl acetate was removed under N2, and the lipids were dissolved in acetonitrile and separated by reverse-phase HPLC on the Discovery C18 column with a gradient containing H2O adjusted with formic acid to pH 4.0 and acetonitrile (27.Fang X. Kaduce T.L. Weintraub N.L. Harmon S. Teesch L.M. Morisseau C. Thompson D.A. Hammock B.D. Spector A.A. J. Biol.

Mass Spectrometry—Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) experiments to separate and identify the metabolites formed by the PCEC from 20-HETE were performed using a ThermoFinnigan LCQ Deca quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer interfaced with a ThermoFinnigan Surveyor liquid chromatograph. The same HPLC parameters were used as described above, except a Supelco C18 5 μm 2.1 × 150 mm Discovery column was used and the flow rate was 200 μl/min. Negative electrospray ionization was also used. The N2 sheath gas and auxiliary gas were maintained at 40 and 30 arbitrary units, respectively, the capillary was heated to 300 °C, and the normalized collision energy was 45% for the LC/MS-MS experiments. ThermoFinnigan Xcalibur 1.3 software was used for data processing. Porcine Coronary Microvessel Studies—Porcine hearts were obtained from a local abattoir. The hearts were quickly harvested and immediately placed in cold (4 °C), oxygenated Krebs bicarbonate buffer solution for dissection. A standard in vitro pressurized arteriole preparation was used to study coronary microvessels (33.Oltman C.L. Kane N.L. Gutterman D.D. Bar R.S. Dellsperger K.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E176-E181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Zink M.H. Oltman C.L. Lu T. Katakam P.V.G. Kaduce T.L. Lee H-C. Dellsperger K.C. Spector A.A. Myers P.R. Weintraub N.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 280: H693-H704Google Scholar). Ventricular microvessels of 100–175 μm intraluminal diameter and ∼1 mm in length were carefully removed from the myocardium, cleaned with the aid of a dissecting microscope and placed in an organ chamber. Each end of the microvessel was cannulated with a glass micropipette and secured with 10-0 ophthalmic suture. The organ chamber was placed on the stage of an inverted microscope. Attached to the microscope were a video camera, a video monitor, and a calibrated video caliper. The organ chamber was connected to a rotary pump that continuously circulated oxygenated Krebs Henseleit solution containing in mm: NaCl 120.0; KCl 4.7; CaCl2 2.5; MgSO4 1.2; NaHCO3 23.0; KH2PO4 1.2; glucose 11.0 and EDTA 0.025. Solutions were aerated with 20% O2, 5% CO2, and 75% N2 and maintained at 37 °C, pH 7.4. An image of the microvessel was displayed on the video monitor and intraluminal diameters were measured by manually adjusting the video micrometer. The resolution of the system allowed measurement of very small (1–2 μm) changes in vessel diameter. Microvessels were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at a hydrostatic distending pressure of 60 mm Hg under conditions of no flow. KCl (75 mm) was added to the bath to test constrictor capacity. After washing with fresh Krebs buffer, the vessel diameter returned to baseline. Endothelin-1 (0.40–1.2 nm, Phoenix Peninsula Laboratories, Inc., San Carlos, CA) was used to constrict the microvessels to 30–60% of their resting diameter. Cumulative concentration-response relationships were evaluated for 20-HETE (10–10 to 10–6m), 20-COOH-AA, (10–10 to 10–6m), or sodium nitroprusside (10–10 to 10–4m) by adding the compound directly to the organ bath. A single dose of sodium nitroprusside (10–4m, Sigma Chemical) was given at the end of each experiment to determine the maximal diameter. All solutions and vasoactive agents were prepared fresh on the day of the experiment. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Sigmastat software (Jandel Scientific) was used for statistical analyses. All concentration response curves were evaluated for differences using 2-way repeated measures analysis of variance followed by the Fisher LSD correction for multiple comparisons. Differences with p < 0.05 are considered significant. 20-HETE Uptake—The PCEC readily incorporated 20-[3H]HETE from the extracellular fluid. Fig. 2 shows that the amount taken up was dependent on the time of incubation and the concentration of 20-HETE. During a 24-h incubation in a medium containing 1 μm 20-[3H]HETE and 0.1 μm BSA, the amount incorporated by the PCEC increased rapidly, reached a maximum at 4 h, and then declined by 30% over the ensuing 20 h (Fig. 2A). After 30 min, 21% of the 20-[3H]HETE initially present in the medium was incorporated by the cells. This increased to 41% at 4 h and then declined to 28% at 24 h. The amount present in the cells after a 2-h incubation increased over the entire range of 20-[3H]HETE concentrations tested, 0.25–7.5 μm (Fig. 2B). However, the percentage uptake of available 20-[3H]HETE decreased as the concentration in the medium increased, from 50% at 0.25 μm to 17% at 7.5 μm. Although the capacity of the PCEC to incorporate 20-HETE is substantial, it is less than arachidonic acid under the same conditions. For example, at a concentration of 1 μm, the PCEC cultures took up 43% of the available 20-HETE, whereas comparable cultures took up 73% of the available arachidonic acid. Formation of 20-HETE Metabolites—HPLC analysis of the medium at various times during the 24-h incubation with 1 μm 20-[3H]HETE demonstrated that the PCEC converted 20-HETE to a number of metabolites (Fig. 3). The major radiolabeled metabolites detected during the incubation are designated in th"

The regulatory role of cholesterol during embryogenesis appears to be mediated by Shh, a signaling molecule in which activity depends on molecular events involving cholesterol. Based on this evidence, we hypothesized that cholesterol, by modifying the activity of Ihh (another of the Hedgehog family proteins) in the growth plate, regulates longitudinal bone growth. To test this hypothesis, we treated rats with AY 9944, an inhibitor of the final reaction of cholesterol synthesis. After 3 weeks, AY 9944 reduced the cumulative growth, tibial growth, and the tibial growth plate height of the rats. To determine whether cholesterol deficiency affects bone growth directly at the growth plate, we then cultured fetal rat metatarsal bones in the presence of AY 9944. After 4 days, AY 9944 suppressed metatarsal growth and growth plate chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy. The inhibitory effect on chondrocyte hypertrophy was confirmed by the AY 9944-mediated decreased expression of collagen X. Lastly, AY 9944 decreased the expression of Ihh in the metatarsal growth plate. We conclude that reduced cholesterol synthesis in the growth plate, possibly by altering the normal activity of Ihh, results in suppressed longitudinal bone growth and growth plate chondrogenesis.

A large of body of evidence supports the notion that cholesterol is essential for normal vertebrate embryogenesis (1Roux C. Wolf C. Mulliez N. Gaoua W. Cormier V. Chevy F. Citadelle D. Am. J. Clin.

These syndromes are characterized by multiple malformations, including central nervous system and skeletal anomalies. The current hypothesis is that cholesterol plays its role in normal embryogenesis by modifying embryonic signaling proteins. The normal expression of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), one of the Hedgehog family proteins, is involved in the patterning of several tissues, including brain and spinal cord, axial skeleton, and limbs (6Chiang C. Litingtung Y. Lee E. Nature. 1996; 383: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). To be activated, Shh undergoes an auto-processing reaction that entails internal cleavage and leads to an amino-terminal product that is responsible for the molecule function (7Lee J.J.

Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome minimum essential medium days postcoital. Along with skeletal malformations, individuals with inborn errors of cholesterol synthesis typically experience post-natal growth failure (2Kelley R.I. Adv. Pediatr. 2000; 47: 1-53PubMed Google Scholar), which raises the question whether cholesterol deficiency adversely affects longitudinal bone growth after embryogenesis is completed. In mammals, longitudinal bone growth occurs at the growth plate of the long bone by endochondral ossification, a two-step process in which cartilage is first formed and then remodeled into bone (11Iannotti J.P. Orthop. Clin. North Am. 1990; 21: 1-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hunziker E.B. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1994; 28: 505-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Growth plate chondrocyte proliferation and chondrocyte hypertrophy lead to formation of new cartilage, chondrogenesis (13Farnum C.E. Wilsman N.J. Anat. Rec. 1987; 219: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Simultaneously, the growth plate is invaded from the bony meta-physis by blood vessels and bone cell precursors, which remodel the cartilage into bone (14Aharinejad S. Marks S.C. Bock P. Mackay C.A.

Indian hedgehog (Ihh), another member of the Hedgehog family, is expressed in the growth plate where it controls chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation (15Bitgood M.J. McMahon A.P. Dev.

Based on this evidence, we hypothesized that cholesterol has an important functional role during longitudinal bone growth and that such role is mediated by the activation of Ihh in the growth plate. To test our hypothesis, we first treated rats with AY 9944, an inhibitor of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, which is the enzyme that catalyzes the final reaction of cholesterol synthesis. After 3 weeks, we analyzed the effects of AY 9944 on the rat body and tibial growth. To determine whether cholesterol deficiency directly affects longitudinal bone growth, we cultured whole rat metatarsal bones in the presence of AY 9944 and evaluated its effects on metatarsal linear growth, on metatarsal chondrocyte proliferation and chondrocyte hypertrophy/differentiation, and on the expression of Ihh in the metatarsal growth plate. Animal Care—For the in vivo study, Sprague-Dawley rats (4-weekold) were housed under standard conditions with a 12-h light/dark cycle (darkness from 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.). The animals (n = 12/group) received a daily dose of AY 9944 (25 mg/kg, dissolved in distilled water) for 3 weeks by gavage. The control rats received vehicle only (distilled water). Weight and whole body length (from nose to anus) were measured weekly after the animals were sedated with an injection of ketamine hydrochloride (0.02 mg/100 g body weight) (Phoenix Pharmaceutical, Inc.) and acepromazine (0.1 mg/100 g body weight) (Roche Applied Science). Serial radiographs of the tibiae were obtained weekly, with each animal placed prone on an x-ray cassette. The lengths of both tibiae were measured on the radiograph, and the average value was calculated. After 21 days (3 weeks) of treatment, blood was collected by ventricular puncture from each animal before sacrificing them by CO2. All blood samples were centrifuged to separate the sera, which were then stored at -20 °C for cholesterol analysis. Animal care was in accordance with published guidelines (28Department of Health Education Welfare Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare Publication 85-23, revised, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1988Google Scholar). Organ Culture—The second, third, and fourth metatarsal bone rudiments were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rat embryos (20 dpc) and cultured individually in 24-well plates (20Bagi C. Burger E.H. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1989; 45: 342-347Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21De Luca F. Barnes M. Uyeda J.A. De-Levi S. Abad V. Palese T. Mericq V. Baron J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Each well contained 0.5 ml of minimum essential medium (MEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.05 mg/ml ascorbic acid (Invitrogen), 1 mm sodium glycerophosphate (Sigma), 0.2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and AY 9944 (1–5 μg/ml) or lovastatin (10 μm) (an inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutarylcoenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis). The plates were incubated in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. The medium was changed every other day. Measurement of Longitudinal Growth—The length of each bone rudiment was measured every day under a dissecting microscope using an eyepiece micrometer. The culture medium was briefly removed immediately before each measurement. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation—To assess cell proliferation, we measured [3H]thymidine incorporation into newly synthesized DNA (22Bagi C.M. Miller S.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). After 4 days of culture, [3H]thymidine was added to the culture medium at a concentration of 5 μCi/ml (specific activity, 25 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences), and the rudiments were incubated for an additional 3 h. To analyze the sites of the growth plate where DNA synthesis occurred, we incubated the control and the AY 9944-treated bones with [3H]thymidine as described above. At the end of the incubation, all bones were fixed in buffered formalin. After routine processing, the samples were embedded in paraffin, and three 5-μm sections were obtained from each metatarsal bone. Autoradiography was performed by dipping the slides in Hypercoat emulsions (Amersham Biosciences), exposing them for 4 weeks, and then developing them with a Kodak-D19 developer. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. The labeling index (number of labeled cells/total cells) was determined separately for the epiphyseal zone and for the proliferative zone. All determinations were made by the same observer blinded to the treatment category. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization was performed as described by Pelton, et al. (23Pelton R.W. Dickinson M.E. Moses H.L. Hogan B.L. Development. 1990; 110: 609-620PubMed Google Scholar). Metatarsals were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C and then dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in paraffin. Longitudinal sections (5 μm thick) were hybridized to 35S-labeled antisense riboprobes. The slides were exposed to photographic emulsion at 4 °C for 4 days and then developed, fixed, and cleared. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and viewed using a light microscope. The sections that were hybridized with a labeled sense riboprobe were used as negative controls. No positive hybridization signal was found in the negative controls. The mouse type X collagen probe (Col10a1) was a 650-bp HindIII fragment containing 360 bp of the noncollagenous (NC1) domain and 260 bp of the 3′-untranslated sequence of the mouse Col10a1 gene in pBluescript (24Apte S. Seldin M. Hayashi M. Olsen B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry—Bone rudiments were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Three 5-μm longitudinal sections were obtained and cleaned of paraffin in xylene and rehydrated in graded ethanol. The sections were incubated in 1% H2O2 for 10 min followed by three rinses with phosphate-buffered saline. For digestion, 0.1% trypsin for 12 min was used at room temperature followed by a triple wash in phosphate-buffered saline. After pre-incubation with 1.5% blocking serum for 30 min at room temperature, the sections were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with goat Ihh polyclonal antibody (1:50) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against mouse type X collagen peptides, anti-NC2 domain (1:200) (25Lunstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Weksler N.B. Cho Y.-J. Cornwall M. Horton W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Depending on the primary antibody, the secondary antibody was anti-goat or anti-rabbit conjugated with biotin (ABC staining system, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at a dilution of 1:200 applied for 30 min. This was followed by an incubation for 30 min with avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase. The sections were then visualized with peroxide substrate for 5 min. After counterstaining in hematoxylin solution for 30 s, the sections were mounted with Permount medium. Control experiments were done by omission of the primary antibody. Quantitative Histology—For the in vivo study, tibiae were removed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, decalcified with Decalcifier II (Surgipath, Richmond, IL) for 1 h, and paraffin-embedded. Three 5–7-μm thick longitudinal sections were obtained and stained with hematoxylin/phloxine/saffron. The effects of AY 9944 on the tibial growth plate were evaluated by measuring the heights (μm) of the whole growth plate, the proliferative zone, and the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate. All measurements were performed by a single observer blinded to the treatment regimen. For the organ culture study, at the end of the culture period, meta-tarsals were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. After routine processing, three longitudinal 5-μm sections were obtained from each metatarsal bone and stained with toluidine blue. From each of the three sections, the heights of the epiphyseal zone, proliferative zone, hypertrophic zone, and of the ossification center were measured, and the average value was calculated. In the growth plate, the epiphyseal zone is characterized by small and rounded cells irregularly arranged in the cartilage matrix. The proliferative zone comprises cells with a flattened shape arranged in columns parallel to the long axis of the bone. In the hypertrophic zone, large cells (defined by a height of ≥9 μm) form a layer adjacent to the calcified region of the metatarsal bone, the ossification center. All quantitative histology was performed by a single observer blinded to the treatment category. Statistics—All data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test or by analysis of variance. Effects of AY 9944 on Animal Body Growth and Tibial Growth—Rats given 25 mg/kg AY 9944 daily for 21 days gained significantly less weight than the control rats (121.0 ± 7.25 versus 75.5 ± 7.52 g; control versus AY 9944, mean ± S.E., p < 0.001). At the beginning of the experimental period, the mean body and tibial lengths of the control and treated groups were not statistically different. After 21 days, AY 9944 caused a significant reduction of the cumulative body growth (5.33 ± 0.22 versus 3.96 ± 0.22 cm; control versus AY 9944, mean ± S.E., p < 0.001) (Figs. 1 and 2A) and of the tibial growth (0.92 ± 0.04 versus 0.72 ± 0.03 cm; control versus AY 9944, mean ± S.E., p < 0.001) (Fig. 2B). The inhibitory effect on the tibial growth was already significant after 7 days of AY 9944 administration (Fig. 2B). When examined histologically, the growth plates of the AY 9944-treated rats appeared thinner than those of the control rats (Fig. 3). AY 9944 caused a significant decrease in the height of the growth plate hypertrophic zone (311 ± 25 versus 184 ± 20 μm; control versus AY 9944, mean ± S.E., p < 0.01) and of the whole growth plate (576 ± 29 versus 403 ± 38 μm; control versus AY 9944, mean ± S.E., p < 0.01). The height of the proliferative zone was not significantly affected by the AY 9944 treatment. Lastly, at the end of the experimental period, the mean plasma cholesterol level of the AY 9944-treated group was significantly lower than that of the control group (68.4 ± 2.85 versus 20.2 ± 3.86 mg/dl, control versus AY 9944, mean ± S.E., p < 0.001).Fig. 2Effects of systemic administration of AY 9944 on cumulative body and tibial growth in rats. 4-week-old rats (n = 12/group) were treated with either vehicle or oral AY 9944 for 3 weeks. A, body length (from nose to anus) was measured weekly, and cumulative growth was calculated at the end of the 3-week period. B, radiographs of the tibiae were obtained weekly, with the lengths of both tibiae measured on the radiograph and the average value calculated. Cumulative growth was calculated at the end of the 3-week period.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Representative photomicrograph of the effects of systemic AY 9944 administration on the rat growth plate.

At the beginning of the experimental period, the mean lengths of the control and treated groups were not statistically different. After 4 days, AY 9944 caused a significant concentration-dependent inhibition of longitudinal bone growth (n = 35–54/group, p < 0.001) (Fig. 4A). Similarly, metatarsal bone rudiments cultured in the presence of 10 μm lovastatin for 4 days grew significantly less than the controls (n = 30/group, p < 0.001) (Fig. 4B). Effects of AY 9944 on Growth Plate Chondrogenesis—Because the rate of longitudinal bone growth depends primarily on the rate of growth plate chondrogenesis, we evaluated the effects of AY 9944 on chondrocyte proliferation and chondrocyte hypertrophy/differentiation, the two main components of growth plate chondrogenesis. To prevent the occurrence of toxic effects, we cultured the bone rudiments in the presence of the lowest inhibitory concentration of AY 9944 on metatarsal growth, 2 μg/ml. To determine the site of the growth plate in which chondrocyte proliferation occurred, we performed autoradiography of [3H]thymidine-labeled bones. 2 μg/ml AY 9944 caused a significant decrease of the labeling index (number of labeled cells/total cells) in the epiphyseal and the proliferative zones (n = 5–6/group, p < 0.01) (Figs. 5 and 6). Consistent with the reduced number of proliferating chondrocytes, treatment with AY 9944 significantly decreased the height of both the epiphyseal (n = 8–11/group, p < 0.01) (Fig. 7) and proliferative (n = 8–11/group, p < 0.001) (Fig. 7) zones. We then evaluated the effects of AY 9944 on chondrocyte hypertrophy/differentiation by assessing the expression of collagen X (a marker of chondrocyte differentiation) in the growth plate by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. In the control metatarsal bones, type X collagen protein and mRNA expression were primarily observed in the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate (Fig. 8, A–C). Treatment with AY 9944 resulted in a dramatic decrease in the expression of both protein and mRNA (Fig. 8, B–D). When quantitative histology was performed, the height of the hypertrophic zone in the AY 9944-treated bones was significantly lower than that of the control (n = 8–11/group, p < 0.01) (Fig. 7). Lastly, we measured the length of the ossification center of the metatarsal bones at the end of the 4-day culture period. In contrast to the effects exerted on the growth plate, AY 9944 did not significantly affect the length of the metatarsal ossification center (data not shown).Fig. 6[3H]thymidine labeling index. Fetal rat metatarsals (n = 8–9/group) were cultured for 4 days in serum-free MEM without or with 2 μg/ml AY 9944, labeled with [3H]thymidine, and prepared for autoradiography as described under Fig. 5. The labeling index (number of labeled cells/total cells) was determined separately for the epiphyseal zone and for the proliferative zone. All determinations were made by the same observer blinded to the treatment category.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 7Quantitation of the effects of AY 9944 on growth plate zones.

In the control bones, the expression of Ihh protein was mainly detected in the lower proliferative and hypertrophic zones (Fig. 9A). In the AY 9944-treated bone rudiments, such expression was markedly reduced (Fig. 9B). Systemic administration of AY 9944 (a distal inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis) to rats induced a significant reduction of their cumulative body and tibial growth. Previous studies have shown that AY 9944 is highly teratogenic in rats. In fetuses of treated dams, AY 9944 caused holoprosencephaly, growth retardation, and multiple skeletal malformations. SLOS, a genetic syndrome caused by the deficiency of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (the enzyme inhibited by AY 9944), is also characterized by variable degrees of holoprosencephaly, intrauterine growth retardation, cranio-facial anomalies, and limb malformations. Interestingly, most of the malformations observed in individuals with SLOS and in AY 9944-treated rats have been described in mice in which Sonic hedgehog (Shh), a key developmental gene, has been knocked out. Subsequent experiments have shown that AY 9944-induced malformations in rodent embryos are indeed caused by disruption of the Shh signaling cascade. It has been recently demonstrated that the activity of Shh depends on post-translational events through which the amino-terminal signaling part of the Shh protein is covalently linked to cholesterol, and such binding gives Shh a strong affinity for cell membranes (26Jeong J. McMahon A.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Based on this evidence, it is likely that most of the embryonic anomalies associated with cholesterol deficiency (AY 9944-mediated or because of inborn errors of cholesterol synthesis) are secondary to altered Shh activity. Our finding of reduced body and tibial growth in rats given AY 9944 would suggest that cholesterol deficiency affects skeletal growth even after embryogenesis is completed. However, systemic suppression of cholesterol synthesis may impair longitudinal bone growth either directly (cholesterol deficiency in the growth plate) or indirectly via the reduced synthesis of cholesterol-derived systemic factors such as steroid hormones. To determine whether cholesterol regulates longitudinal bone growth locally at the growth plate, we used an organ culture model, the fetal rat metatarsal bone. The metatarsal bone, which comprises two cartilaginous regions resembling the mature growth plate, is a model that enabled us to assess the effects of AY 9944 on longitudinal bone growth as well as on the two main processes responsible for such growth, growth plate chondrocyte proliferation and chondrocyte hypertrophy/differentiation. In this model, AY 9944 inhibited metatarsal longitudinal growth. Similar growth inhibition was observed in metatarsal bones cultured with lovastatin, which, unlike AY 9944, inhibits an early step of cholesterol synthesis. These findings, which are consistent with the effects elicited by AY 9944 in vivo, suggest that impaired cholesterol synthesis in the growth plate is responsible for suppressed longitudinal bone growth. AY 9944 suppressed growth plate chondrocyte proliferation as assessed by autoradiography and histology. In addition, AY 9944 reduced the height of the growth plate hypertrophic zone as assessed by histological studies. The cellular enlargement of the growth plate chondrocytes adjacent to the bone ossification center is critical for longitudinal bone growth (17St.-Jacques B. Hammerschmidt M. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2072-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar, 18Karp S.J. Schipani E. St.-Jacques B. Hunzelman J. Kronenberg H.M. McMahon A.P. Development. 2000; 127: 543-548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the AY 9944-treated bone rudiments, the decreased expression of collagen X (a marker for terminally differentiated chondrocytes) (16Van der Eerden B.C. Karperien M. Gevers E.F. Lowik C.W. Wit J.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1045-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) confirmed the AY 9944-mediated inhibition of growth plate chondrocyte hypertrophy/differentiation. A narrowed hypertrophic zone can be due to either a decreased number of proliferating cells undergoing hypertrophy/differentiation or to an increased number of hypertrophic cells being replaced by bone tissue. In our study, the lack of any effect of AY 9944 on the length of the metatarsal ossification center renders the latter possibility unlikely. To determine the molecular mechanisms by which cholesterol deficiency leads to reduced longitudinal bone growth and growth plate chondrogenesis, we evaluated the expression of Ihh in the AY 9944-treated metatarsal bones. In our system, AY 9944 inhibited Ihh expression. Ihh, along with Shh and Dhh, belongs to a family of morphogens involved in embryonic patterning, limb bud development, and endochondral bone formation (17St.-Jacques B. Hammerschmidt M. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2072-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). During a post-embryonic phase, Ihh is localized in the growth plate where it regulates chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy. Ihh null mice display markedly reduced chondrocyte proliferation and delayed and abnormal chondrocyte hypertrophy/differentiation (17St.-Jacques B. Hammerschmidt M. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2072-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Based on this evidence, we speculate that reduced cholesterol synthesis in the meta-tarsal bones because of AY 9944 treatment suppresses Ihh expression and, in turn, chondrocyte proliferation and hyper-trophy/differentiation. In light of the known role of cholesterol in Shh activation, it is conceivable that cholesterol may also be essential for the activation of Ihh and its anchorage to the cell membrane. Along with decreased cholesterol synthesis, decreased activity of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (secondary to either AY 9944 or a genetic mutation as in individuals with SLOS) leads to accumulation of 7-dehydrocholesterol, the immediate precursor of cholesterol in its synthetic pathway. Thus, the increased levels of this precursor could potentially be responsible for the effects elicited by AY 9944. On the other hand, there are several arguments in favor of the theory that cholesterol deficiency, rather than the accumulation of precursor(s), is the primary cause of the inhibitory action of AY 9944 on embryonic development and longitudinal bone growth. First, decreased activity of different enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis (because of either chemical inhibitors like lovastatin or inborn errors of metabolism) (1Roux C. Wolf C. Mulliez N. Gaoua W. Cormier V. Chevy F. Citadelle D. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2000; 71: 1270S-1279SCrossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 5Nwokoro N.A. Wassif C.A. Porter F.D. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 74: 105-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have similar effects on embryonic development and bone growth. Second, experimental evidence indicates that, in pregnant rats treated with AY 9944, accumulation of 7-dehydrocholesterol in the presence of normal levels of cholesterol is compatible with normal development (1Roux C. Wolf C. Mulliez N. Gaoua W. Cormier V. Chevy F. Citadelle D. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2000; 71: 1270S-1279SCrossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and normal Shh signaling (27Gofflot F. Gaoua W. Bourguignon L. Roux C. Picard J.J. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 220: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Third, in individuals with SLOS there is a poor correlation of clinical severity with the levels of 7-dehydrocholesterol but a strong inverse correlation with the level of cholesterol (2Kelley R.I. Adv. Pediatr. 2000; 47: 1-53PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, our findings indicate that cholesterol, possibly by facilitating the function of Ihh in the growth plate, plays a key role in the regulation of growth plate chondrogenesis and longitudinal bone growth. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the functional interaction between cholesterol and Ihh.

The rate of O2 association (kon) with full-length Ec DOS is extremely slow at 0.0019 μm–1 s–1, compared with >9.5 μm–1 s–1 for 6-coordinated globin-type hemoproteins, as determined by the stopped-flow method. This rate is dramatically increased (up to 16-fold) in the isolated heme-bound PAS domain.

Mutations at Met-95 in the isolated PAS domain, which may be a heme axial ligand in the Fe(II) complex, lead to a further increase in the kon value by more than 30-fold, and consequently, a decrease in the Kd value to less than 1 μm. The kon value for CO binding to the full-length wild-type enzyme is also very low (0.00081 μm–1 s–1).

Changes in the redox state of the heme bound to the N-terminal PAS domain may induce a subtle conformational change, which intramolecularly transmits signals to the C-terminal PDE domain to initiate and/or regulate catalysis.

In these enzymes, association or dissociation of the exogenous axial ligand (O2, CO, or NO) from the heme iron leads to protein conformational changes, which in turn transmit signals to other domains to regulate catalysis or binding to DNA. The Ec DOS signal transducing mechanism appears to be unique, since changes in the redox state of the PAS domain, rather than iron coordination chemistry, are responsible for signal transduction (1Sasakura Y.

However, in other words, signal transduction triggered by ligand binding (CO and NO) is common to Ec DOS and FixL, based on the finding that CO or NO binding abolishes catalysis by Ec DOS (1Sasakura Y.

The physicochemical properties of the isolated heme-bound PAS domain of Ec DOS were initially characterized by Gilles-Gonzales and colleagues (14Delgado-Nixon V.M. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2685-2691Google Scholar). They reported that Ec DOS is a direct O2 sensor enzyme that takes advantage of its characteristic O2 binding affinity to modulate catalysis. The association rate constant (kon) for O2 (0.0026 μm–1 s–1), CO (0.0011 μm–1 s–1), and NO (0.002 μm–1 s–1) and dissociation constants (Kd) for O2 (13 μm) and CO (10 μm) were similar for the isolated PAS domain (14Delgado-Nixon V.M. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2685-2691Google Scholar). To date, the corresponding association kinetics and equilibrium constants have not been reported for the full-length Ec DOS. The same group characterized a PDE from Acetobacter xylinum (AxPDEA1) and suggested that this enzyme is O2-sensitive, based on the finding that O2 binding suppressed PDE catalysis by 70% in the Fe(II) enzyme (15Chang A.L. Tuckerman J.R. Gonzalez G. Mayer R. Weinhouse H. Volman G. Amikan D. Benziman M. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3420-3426Google Scholar). AxPDEA1 displayed higher kon and koff values for O2 (6.6 μm–1 s–1 and 77 s–1, respectively) than the isolated PAS domain of Ec DOS, despite similar Kd values (12 μm). The kinetics of exogenous axial ligand binding to the heme protein and associated equilibrium constants provide useful information on the structure and characteristics of the heme distal site and ligand access channel (16Antonini E.

It is important to study O2 and CO binding, particularly to full-length Ec DOS, to clarify whether the enzyme is a direct O2 sensor. These analyses would also be useful in elucidating the structure of the heme distal site and ligand access channel and their relation to the signal transduction mechanism. Based on the amino acid sequence alignment and crystal structure of a similar PAS enzyme, FixL (7Hao B. Isaza C. Arndt J. Soltis M. Chan M.K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12952-12958Google Scholar, 20Gonzalez G. Dioum E.M. Bertokucci C.M. Tomita T. Ikeda-Saito M. Cheesman M.R. Watmough N.J.

Gillez-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4819-4826Google Scholar), Met-95 is suggested as a heme axial ligand trans to His-77. In the present study, we report rate and equilibrium constants for O2 and CO binding to the full-length enzyme in the Fe(II) state, isolated heme-bound PAS domain, and Met-95 mutants of Ec DOS as well as infrared spectra of their Fe(II)-CO complexes. The O2 and CO association rates were extremely low for the full-length wild type enzyme, whereas the isolated heme-bound PAS domain displayed significantly enhanced ligand binding. In contrast, the Fe(II)-O2 complex of the isolated PAS domain was more resistant to oxidation than the full-length wild-type enzyme. Mutation of the putative heme axial ligand, Met-95, facilitated O2 and CO association and altered the autoxidation rate. We discuss the unusual heme environment of this enzyme in association with the signal transduction mechanism. Materials and Proteins—DEAE-Sephadex was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The NO donor, (±)-(E)-4-methyl-2-[(E)-hydroxyimino]-5-nitro-6-methoxy-3-hexenamide (NOR-1), was obtained from Dojindo (Kumamoto, Japan). Other chemicals were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Cloning and expression in E. coli and purification of full-length Ec DOS (amino acids 1–807) and the isolated heme-bound PAS domain (amino acids 1–147) were performed as described previously (1Sasakura Y. Hirata S. Sugiyama S. Suzuki S. Taguchi S. Watanabe M. Matsui T. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23821-23827Google Scholar, 2Sato A. Sasakura Y. Sugiyama S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32650-32658Google Scholar). Site-directed cassette mutagenesis was performed using oligonucleotides. The sequence was confirmed by Sanger's method using an automatic sequencer DSQ-2000L (Shimadzu Co.). Ec DOS-PAS gene mutants were expressed in BL21 E. coli cells. There are slight differences in isolation of the isolated heme-bound PAS domain and the full-length enzyme. Briefly, the full-length protein was expressed at 20 °C to avoid proteolytic digestion, whereas the isolated heme-bound PAS domain was expressed at 25 °C. The yield for purified full-length Ec DOS was about 10% that for the isolated heme-bound PAS domain from the same culture scale. Full-length Ec DOS, isolated PAS domain, and Met-95 mutants were more than 95% homogenous, as evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Optical Absorption, Stopped-flow, and Flash Photolysis Spectra— Spectral experiments were performed under aerobic conditions on Shimadzu UV-1650, UV-2500, and Hitachi U-2010 spectrophotometers maintained at 25 °C by a temperature controller. Anaerobic spectral experiments were conducted on a Shimadzu UV-160A spectrophotometer in a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere with an O2 concentration of less than 50 ppm (22Nakano R. Sato H. Watanabe A. Ito O. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8570-8574Google Scholar, 23Sagami I. Daff S. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30036-30042Google Scholar, 24Rozhkova E.A. Fujimoto N. Sagami I. Daff S.N. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16888-16894Google Scholar). Following reduction of the heme by sodium dithionite, excess dithionite was removed using a Sephadex G-25 column in the glove box. To ensure that the appropriate temperature of the solution was maintained, the reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min, prior to spectroscopic measurements. To obtain the O2 and CO association rates, solutions of Fe(II) Ec DOS proteins (containing nearly 10 μm heme) reduced with sodium dithionite in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) were rapidly mixed with 260–1300 μm O2 or 200–1000 μm CO solutions using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer under anaerobic conditions (Otsuka Electronics model RA-401) at 25 °C. Formation of O2 and CO complexes was monitored at 428 and 423 nm, respectively. To measure the O2 dissociation rate, O2-bound Ec DOS was mixed with CO-saturated buffer in the absence of dithionite using a stopped-flow spectrometer. For the full-length wild-type enzyme, the CO-saturated buffer contained a trace of dithionite. To determine the CO dissociation rate, dithionite-reduced CO-bound Ec DOS protein was mixed with NO-saturated buffer in the presence of a trace of dithionite, using a rapid scan spectrometer (Shimadzu model Multispec 1500). The NO gas solution was prepared using the NO donor, NOR-1. The effects of EDTA on ligand binding kinetics were additionally evaluated. No significant differences were observed in the presence or absence of EDTA. At least three experiments were conducted to obtain each rate constant. Regression analyses were performed and lines representing an optimum correlation coefficient were selected (23Sagami I. Daff S. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30036-30042Google Scholar). Experimental errors were within 20% for O2 kinetics and 10% for CO kinetics. To obtain autoxidation rates, solutions of the Fe(III) Ec DOS proteins (containing ∼10 μm heme) were reduced with sodium dithionite in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 1 mm EDTA. Excess dithionite was removed using a Sephadex G-25 column in the glove box. After removal, the protein solution was mixed with air-saturated buffer to form the Fe(II)-O2 complex in a cuvette. Changes in UV/visible spectra were monitored with respect to time at 25 °C, using a rapid scan spectrometer (Shimadzu model Multi-spec 1500). Laser flash photolysis experiments were conducted in a 10 × 10-mm cell at 25 °C using a 433-nm light of OPO of a Nd:YAG laser (Quanta-Ray, GCR-130) producing an excitation power of 40 mJ with a repeated pulse duration of 1.2 s. Details of this apparatus are described elsewhere (25Fukuzumi S. Ohkubo K. Suenobu T. Kato K. Fujitsuka M. Ito O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 8459-8467Google Scholar). Kinetic data were analyzed using Igor Pro software (Wave-Metrics). Experiments were repeated at least three times. Data were reproducible, with errors within 20%. FT IR Spectra—FT IR spectra were obtained using a Bio-Rad FTS-3000MX spectrometer with 2 cm–1 resolution, employing an accumulation time of 5 min and a set of 3-mm CaF2 windows with a 0.05-mm Teflon spacer. Proteins were concentrated to 2–3 mm heme using Ultrafree-MC (Millipore Co., Billerica, MA). Protein samples were reduced with 1 mm sodium dithionite and exposed to a stream of CO gas. O2 Association Kinetics—The O2 association kinetics experiments (shown in Fig. 1) were conducted using a stopped-flow spectrometer. The time profile (inset of Fig. 1A) of O2 binding to full-length Ec DOS was composed of two phases. The rate constant of the fast O2 association phase was dependent on the O2 concentration (Fig. 1B). The kon value (0.0019 μm–1 s–1) obtained with Ec DOS was extremely low, compared with those of other PAS heme proteins (BjFixL, RmFixLH, and AxPDEA1) or 6-coordinated Hb such as Arabidopsis trHb, barley Hb, cytoglobin, neuroglobin, and Synechocystis trHb (27Watts R.A. Hunt P.W. Hvitved A.N. Hargrove M.S. Peacock W.J. Dennis E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10119-10124Google Scholar, 28Duff S.M.G. Wittenberg J.B. Hill R.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 34714-34721Google Scholar) (Table I). The slow phase was independent of the O2 concentration. Because the rate of the slow phase is similar to that of autoxidation (described below), it is possible that the phase reflects autoxidation and/or protein relaxation. The dissociation rate constant (koff) was calculated as 0.64 s–1. Accordingly, the Kd value for O2 obtained from the kon and koff values was calculated as 340 μm. This value is comparable with that of BjFixL (140 μm), but higher than those of other PAS heme proteins, RmFixLH and AxPDEA1 (12–31 μm). Interestingly, this value is much higher than that of O2 binding to 6-coordinated Hb (0.00056–0.0029 μm) (Table I).Table IRate and equilibrium constants for O2 association and dissociation to / from the wild-type and Met-95 mutants of Ec DOSkonkoffKdRef.μm-1 s-1s-1μmFull-length wild-type0.00190.64340aKd value was calculated from kon and koff values.This workPAS domain wild-type0.0310.6120aKd value was calculated from kon and koff values.This work0.00260.0341314Delgado-Nixon V.M.

Open table in a new tab The heme redox state appears to regulate PDE activity, such that only the enzyme in the Fe(II) state is active (1Sasakura Y. Hirata S. Sugiyama S. Suzuki S. Taguchi S. Watanabe M. Matsui T. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23821-23827Google Scholar). Conversely, the substrate may affect the structure of the heme binding site. Accordingly, the effect of the substrate, cAMP, on O2 binding kinetics was examined. The presence of cAMP in our experiments did not significantly alter the kon value. The kon value of the isolated heme-bound PAS domain for O2 was increased 16-fold compared with the wild-type protein (up to 0.031 μm–1 s–1). The koff value was estimated as 0.61 s–1 (Fig. 2), and the Kd value was 20 μm. Delgado-Nixon et al. (14Delgado-Nixon V.M. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2685-2691Google Scholar) reported that the kon, koff, and Kd values for O2 binding to the isolated PAS domain were 0.0026 μm–1 s–1, 0.034 s–1, and 13 μm, respectively. Interestingly, these kon and koff values are significantly lower than those obtained in the present study. Met-95 of the PAS domain of Ec DOS is a suggested heme axial ligand (7Hao B. Isaza C. Arndt J. Soltis M. Chan M.K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12952-12958Google Scholar, 20Gonzalez G. Dioum E.M. Bertokucci C.M. Tomita T. Ikeda-Saito M. Cheesman M.R. Watmough N.J.

Mutation of this residue increased the kon value to more than 1 μm–1 s–1, and thus evaluation by the stopped-flow method was unfeasible. The koff values for M95A, M95L, and M95H mutant proteins for O2 were determined as 0.73, 0.45, and 0.79 s–1, respectively. The corresponding Kd values are therefore likely to be less than 1 μm. The laser flash photolysis method was applied to the Fe(II)-O2 complexes to accurately determine the faster association rates of O2 with the Met-95 mutants. However, the amount of O2 photodissociation from Ec DOS proteins was extremely low under our experimental conditions. Consequently, establishing the kon values was not feasible. We additionally attempted to measure Kd values by monitoring Soret spectral changes upon the addition of O2. However, relatively fast autoxidation hampered the estimation of the exact Kd values of Ec DOS proteins. Autoxidation Rates of Fe(II)-O2 Complexes—To elucidate the local environment of the Ec DOS heme, we evaluated the autoxidation rates of the Fe(II)-O2 complexes. The autoxidation time profile of all Fe(II)-O2 complexes studied comprised only one phase. The rates obtained are summarized in Table II. The rate for the full-length wild-type enzyme was 0.015 min–1. Addition of the substrate, cAMP, did not significantly alter the rate. However, the rate in the isolated heme-bound PAS domain was decreased by 2.6-fold to 0.0058 min–1. The redox stability of the Fe(II)-O2 complex of the isolated PAS domain was evident during the purification procedure. Specifically, the characteristic Soret peak of the Fe(II)-O2 complex was occasionally detected in the lysis solution of E. coli expressing the PAS domain, but scarcely observed in the solution of E. coli expressing the full-length wild-type enzyme. M95A and M95L mutations further decreased the rate to 0.0013–0.0017 min–1. Interestingly, the autoxidation rate for the M95H mutant was comparable (0.018 min–1) to that of the full-length wild-type enzyme. Met-95 mutations in full-length Ec DOS also led to a decrease in the autoxidation rate. The effects of the mutations in the full-length enzyme were similar to those in the isolated PAS domain. The autoxidation rate of the M95H full-length mutant was similar to that of the wild-type full-length enzyme, whereas those of M95A and M95L mutants were lower, compared with the wild-type full-length enzyme. All the full-length Met-95 mutant proteins display similar autoxidation rates to those of the corresponding isolated PAS domain.Table IIAutoxidation rates of the O2 complexes of the wild-type and Met-95 mutants of full-length Ec DOS enzymes and the isolated heme-bound PAS domainProteinFull-lengthPAS domainmin-1Wild-type0.0150.0058M95A0.000300.0013M95L0.00280.0017M95H0.0170.018 Open table in a new tab CO Binding Kinetic Constants—To clarify the ligand discrimination mechanism of the heme of Ec DOS, we obtained kon values for the binding of CO to Fe(II) complexes. The kon value for full-length Ec DOS wild-type enzyme was obtained by the stopped-flow method (Fig. 3). The observed time profile was monophasic, and the rate was dependent on the CO concentration. The kon value was determined as 0.00081 μm–1 s–1, whereas the koff rate was calculated as 0.0025 s–1 (Fig. 4). The Kd value was estimated from the kon and koff values as 3.1 μm. Addition of cAMP to the full-length wild-type enzyme did not significantly alter these kinetic parameters. The kon value determined for the full-length enzyme was much lower than those reported for other PAS proteins and 6-coordinated globins (Table III).Fig. 4Determination of the koff value for CO dissociation from the wild-type isolated PAS domain.

The function of SFK is regulated by phosphorylation at the C-terminal regulatory site mediated by Csk. Recently a novel SFK target Cbp (or PAG) was identified as a membrane-anchored scaffold protein for Csk. To establish the mechanism of Csk/Cbp-mediated regulation of SFK in vivo, we observed dynamic changes in the interaction of Csk with Cbp by utilizing fusion proteins with modified green fluorescent proteins: cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) or yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). Upon SFK activation induced by epidermal growth factor stimulation, fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) response was detected transiently at membrane ruffles in COS1 cells co-expressing CFP-Csk and Cbp-YFP and in cells expressing a single-molecule FRET indicator consisting of CskSH2 and Cbp. Suppression of SFK by PP2 or use of a mutant Cbp that lacks the Csk binding site abolished the FRET response, although a dominant-negative form of Csk enhanced and sustained the FRET response, demonstrating that the FRET response is dependent upon the SFK activity. These observations show that Csk/Cbp-mediated down-regulation of SFK takes place at membrane ruffles in an early stage of epidermal growth factor signaling and suggest that the Csk/Cbp-based FRET indicators are useful for monitoring the status of SFK in living cells.

Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). SFKs serve as molecular switches that regulate a variety of cellular events including cell growth, division, and differentiation (2Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). SFKs are strictly regulated by the phosphorylation of two tyrosine residues: autophosphorylation of a tyrosine in the kinase domain is required for full activity, whereas phosphorylation of a tyrosine in the C-terminal region abolishes activity (3Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). There is ordinarily an equilibrium between an inactive state in which the phosphorylated C-terminal tyrosine binds intramolecularly to the SH2 domain, and a “primed” state in which the C-terminal tyrosine is dephosphorylated. In response to an extracellular signal, the primed SFK can be activated by accumulation of SFK itself or of other components that bind to its SH2 or SH3 domains. Thus, it is thought that SFK activity is controlled in part by the relative activities of a kinase and a phosphatase that target the C-terminal tyrosine.

Phosphorylation of the C-terminal tyrosine is dependent upon another PTK, C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) (4Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H.

Cell. 1993; 73: 1125-1135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The importance of Csk as a negative regulator of SFK and the absence of any functional redundancy have been demonstrated by the observation that Csk knockout mice that die before birth exhibit constitutive activation of many SFKs. Csk is a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase consisting of an SH3, an SH2, and a kinase domain (4Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). There is evidence that the SH3 and SH2 domains of Csk are essential for the regulation of SFK, and that Csk can be recruited to the membrane when SFKs are in an active state (6Sabe H. Hata A.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5937-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), although the molecular mechanism underlying these events remains unknown. Recently, we and others (8Kawabuchi M. Satomi Y.

Cbp is located exclusively in so-called lipid rafts in which cholesterol, glycosphingolipid, and a variety of membrane-anchored signaling molecules including SFK accumulate. Lipid rafts are thus viewed as platforms for signaling across the membrane. The interaction of Cbp with Csk is also dependent upon the phosphorylation of its Tyr-314 by SFK (8Kawabuchi M. Satomi Y.

Based on these lines of evidence, a model of feedback regulation of SFK has been presented according to which activation of SFK by an extracellular stimulus leads to the phosphorylation of Cbp; this results in recruitment of Csk to lipid rafts and is followed by termination of SFK function (11Cary L.A. Cooper J.A. Nature. 2000; 404: 945-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 12Davidson D. Bakinowski M. Thomas M.L. Horejsi V. Veillette A. Mol. Cell.

However, there is no conclusive evidence that this actually occurs in living cells. Recently, in vivo indicators based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) technology have been developed for monitoring intracellular signal transduction cascades (14Miyawaki A. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 15Meyer T. Teruel M.N.

FRET is the nonradioactive transfer of excited-state energy from an excited donor to an acceptor; it depends upon proper spectral overlap of the donor and acceptor, their distance from each fluorophore, and the orientation of the fluorophores (14Miyawaki A. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 18Miyawaki A. Tsien R.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 472-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Variants of green fluorescent protein (GFP) provide genetically encoded fluorophores that serve as the donors and acceptors in FRET. With the development of spectrally different fluorescent proteins and improved technologies for fluorescence measurements, fluorescent indicators have permitted visualization of singe-cell events in space and time (19Mitra R.D. Silva C.M. Youvan D.C. Gene. 1996; 173: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 20Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 178-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). To establish the mechanism of regulation of SFK in vivo, we have observed the SFK-induced interaction between Csk and Cbp by FRET using cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). We also developed a single-molecule FRET indicator consisting of the Csk SH2 domain and Cbp to monitor the activation of SFKs in living cells. Antibodies and Reagents—Rabbit polyclonal anti-Cbp antibodies were raised against a peptide corresponding to 155 amino acids (residues 53-208) of Cbp and affinity-purified with peptide-coupled resin. Anti-GFP polyclonal antibody, anti-Fyn polyclonal antibody (FYN3), anti-Src monoclonal antibody (Ab-1), anti-phosphotyrosine ERK antibody, and anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (anti-pY, 4G10) were purchased from Molecular Probes, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Oncogene Research, Cell Signaling Technology, and Upstate Biotechnology, respectively. Anti-Src polyclonal pTyr418 and anti-Src polyclonal pTyr529 were purchased from BioSource. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. PP2 and EGF were obtained from Calbiochem and PeproTech, respectively. Other materials and chemicals were obtained from commercial sources. Plasmid Construction—Vectors pcDNA3-SE10C and pRSET-SECFP were provided by A. Miyawaki of the Brain Science Institute, RIKEN, Wako-shi, Japan. The yfp and cfp genes were amplified from these vectors by PCR and ligated into vectors pEGFP-N1 and pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) using the KpnI and NotI restriction sites (for the N1 vector) and NheI and SalI restriction sites (for the C1 vector), so that gfp was replaced with cfp or yfp. To generate the CFP-Csk expression vector, the open reading frame of rat Csk cDNA without the start codon was subcloned into pBluescript II Sk(+) (Strategene) and inserted in-frame into the SalI and KpnI restriction sites of the CFP-expression vector. CFP-CskR222 was generated by replacing Lys-222 by Arg, and the CskR222 open reading frame was cloned in-frame into the SalI and KpnI restriction sites of the CFP-expression vector. To generate the Cbp-YFP expression vector, the open reading frame of rat Cbp cDNA was ligated and cloned in-frame into the NheI and HindIII restriction sites of the YFP-expression vector. The F314Cbp-YFP expression vector was generated by replacing Tyr-314 by Phe and constructed by the same procedure as Cbp-YFP. To construct Chimera, cDNA segments of YFP, CFP, the transmembrane and substrate domains of Cbp, and the SH2 domain of Csk were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pcDNA3.1/Hygro vector (Invitrogen) using the restriction sites shown in Fig. 7A. From the amino terminus, Chimera consists of the transmembrane domain of Cbp (amino acids 1-52), YFP (amino acids 1-236), the substrate domain of Cbp (amino acids 193-424), a spacer (Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-Thr), the SH2 domain of Csk (amino acids 81-158), and CFP (amino acids 1-236). In the F314Chimera vector, Tyr-314 of Cbp (amino acids 193-424) was replaced with Phe and was constructed by the same procedure as Chimera. All constructed plasmids were sequenced with an ABI310 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan). The Fyn expression vectors, pME18Sneo-Fyn and pME18Sneo-FynF528, were obtained from T. Yamamoto (University of Tokyo). Cell Culture and Transfection—COS1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Equitech-Bio, Inc.). Transfection was performed with LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—COS1 cells were co-transfected with combinations of expression vectors, as shown in each figure legend. The transfected cells were seeded onto 100-mm dishes, serum-starved for 12 h, and stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF. After incubation for various times, samples were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with ice-cold ODG buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P40, 2% N-octyl-β-d-glucoside, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. In other experiments, the transfected cells were treated with the SFK inhibitor, PP2 (2 μm), for 30 min before EGF stimulation. The cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS, 10% sucrose, 0.004% bromphenol blue); equal volumes were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose transfer membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were blocked with T-TBS or T-TBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, incubated with primary antibodies for 3 h, washed with T-TBS, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h, and again washed with T-TBS. Immunoreactivity was visualized with a chemiluminescence system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For the immunoprecipitation assay, cell lysates were incubated with anti-GFP or anti-Cbp antibody coupled with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 3 h. The washed beads were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10), anti-GFP, or anti-Csk antibodies. In Vitro Spectrophotometric Measurements—COS1 cells expressing Cbp-YFP and CFP-Csk or Chimera with or without pME18Sneo-Fyn and pME18Sneo-FynF528 were lysed in ODG buffer and cleared as described above. Lysates were also prepared from COS1 cells co-expressing CbpF314-YFP and CFP-Csk and those expressing F314Chimera. Expression of individual proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-GFP, anti-Cbp, and anti-Fyn antibody. A fluorescence spectrum was obtained at an excitation wavelength of 433 nm with an F-2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi Co, Tokyo, Japan). To confirm FRET, cell lysates were incubated with 200 μg/ml proteinase K or 2 μm PP2 at 37 °C for 30 min, and cleared supernatants were analyzed by immunoblotting and spectrophotometric assay. Imaging of SFK Activation—To monitor the activation of SFK in the living cell, COS1 cells were transfected with plasmids Cbp-YFP/CFP-Csk, CbpF314-YFP/CFP-Csk, Cbp-YFP/CFP-CskR222, Chimera, and F314Chimera. Twelve hours later, they were plated onto a 35 mm-diameter collagen-coated glass-based dish (Asahi Techno Glass Co., Tokyo, Japan), serum-starved for 12 h, and stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF with or without pre-treatment with 2 μm PP2 for 30 min. After EGF stimulation, the cells were imaged every 10 s with an Olympus IX71 microscope equipped with a 75-W xenon arc lamp, two filter changers, a temperature-controlled chamber, and a cooled charge-coupled device camera, CoolSNAP HQ (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ), controlled by MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). For dual-emission ratio imaging of FRET, we used the 86006 filter set (Chroma), an S436/10 and S492/18 excitation filter, a 455DRLP dichroic mirror (Omega), and two emission filters, S465/30m for CFP and S535/30m for YFP, alternated by a filter changer. The cells were illuminated with a 75-W xenon arc lamp through a 10% neutral density filter (Omega Optical Inc.) and a 60× oil immersion objective lens. The ratio image of YFP/CFP was created with MetaMorph software and used to represent FRET efficiency. For photobleaching YFP, cells were illuminated without a neutral density filter and photobleached with an S492/18 excitation filter for 1 min. Co-localization of Csk with Cbp in EGF-stimulated COS1 Cells—To monitor the changes in localization of Cbp and Csk in living cells, Cbp-YFP and CFP-Csk were expressed in COS1 cells, and their localization was observed by fluorescence microscopy. We confirmed that these tagged proteins behaved just like the endogenous proteins by immunocytochemical analysis (data not shown). Cells co-expressing Cbp-YFP and CFP-Csk were stimulated with EGF, and images of CFP and YFP, along with differential interference contrast (DIC) images, were obtained every 10 s by time-lapse microscopy. CFP-Csk was present in the cytoplasm of resting cells and translocated to the plasma membrane and membrane ruffles after EGF stimulation (Fig. 1A, top). Furthermore, CFP-Csk was strictly co-localized with Cbp-YFP at the membrane ruffles (Fig. 1A, bottom). CFP-Csk was not translocated when cells were pre-treated with the SFK inhibitor, PP2 (Fig. 1B), or when it was co-expressed with a mutant form of Cbp, CbpF314-YFP, that lacked the binding site Tyr-314 (Fig. 1C). These observations suggest that Csk associates with Cbp when phosphorylated by SFK. Direct Interaction between Csk and Cbp in Cell Lysates—To verify the Csk-Cbp interaction in vitro, COS1 cells expressing Cbp-YFP and CFP-Csk were stimulated with EGF, and lysates were subjected to biochemical analyses (Fig. 2A). After EGF stimulation, tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins including the EGF receptor and Erk1/2 increased, and activation of SFK, as indicated by phosphorylation of its autophosphorylation site, Tyr-418, peaked at about 10 min after stimulation. This peak was accompanied by an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbp and in the level of co-immunoprecipitated CFP-Csk with Cbp-YFP, although there was significant basal interaction because of basal phosphorylation of Cbp. The involvement of SFK is supported by the observation that pretreatment with PP2 suppressed these effects, although activation of Erk1/2 persisted, because the Erk1/2 pathway is independent of SFK signaling (Fig. 2B). In COS1 cells expressing CbpF314-YFP instead of Cbp-YFP, co-immunoprecipitation of CbpF314-YFP with CFP-Csk was not detected in either the resting or activated state (Fig. 2C). It is clear, therefore, that Csk and Cbp interact when Cbp is phosphorylated by activated SFK. Detection of Interaction between Csk and Cbp by FRET in Vitro—We examined the interaction between CFP-Csk and Cbp-YFP by FRET to confirm the interaction between Csk and Cbp and to see if this interaction could be useful for monitoring the activation of SFK in living cells. To evaluate the FRET efficiency of these indicators, we first carried out in vitro spectrometric studies. The indicators were co-expressed in COS1 cells with Fyn, a member of the SFK family, or a constitutively active form of Fyn, FynF528, to induce efficient phosphorylation of Cbp. Cell lysates were prepared, and expression of each of the proteins was confirmed (Fig. 3A). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbp-YFP proved to be dependent upon the expression of Fyn or FynF528, whereas co-precipitation of CFP-Csk was dependent upon the phosphorylation of Tyr-314 (Fig. 3A). The fluorescence emission profiles of these lysates were obtained at an excitation wavelength of 433 nm (Fig. 3B). FRET is typically observed as an increase in an emission peak at 527 nm and a decrease in an emission peak at 475 nm (14Miyawaki A. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), and the ratio of emission at 527 nm and 475 nm is used to measure FRET. As shown in Fig. 3C, the emission ratio of Cbp-YFP/CFP-Csk increased in the presence of Fyn or Fyn F528. When CbpF314-YFP replaced Cbp-YFP, no change in FRET was observed even in the presence of Fyn. To confirm that the increase in the emission ratio was caused by FRET, the cell lysate was treated with proteinase K. Because GFP and its derivatives are resistant to proteinase K (14Miyawaki A. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), this treatment removed the protein tags and, as shown in Fig. 3B, greatly diminished the emission peak at 527 nm. Interaction of Csk with Cbp in the Living Cell—Next we examined time-lapse images of the interaction of Csk with Cbp in the living cell. COS1 cells co-expressing Cbp-YFP and CFP-Csk were stimulated with EGF, and images of CFP, YFP, and DIC were obtained every 10 s. YFP/CFP ratio images were used to measure FRET in the intensity-modulated display mode. The mosaic of ratio images is presented using eight colors from blue to red, corresponding to low and high ratios, respectively. A change in the YFP/CFP emission ratio was detected along membrane ruffles upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 4A). The maximum signal was detected 5-10 min after stimulation, which is in good agreement with the activation of SFK by EGF stimulation. No increase in the YFP/CFP emission ratio was observed when the cells were pre-treated with PP2 (Fig. 4B) or when CbpF314-YFP was used (Fig. 4C). In addition, photobleaching of YFP completely removed the YFP signal but increased the emission of CFP at membrane ruffles (Refs. 18Miyawaki A. Tsien R.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 472-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 21Mochizuki N. Yamashita S. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Nagai T. Miyawaki A. Matsuda M. Nature. 2001; 411: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar; data not shown). FRET signals, therefore, reveal that CFP-Csk and Cbp-YFP interact at membrane ruffles. Requirement of Csk for SFK Regulation in Living Cells—To examine the role of Csk in the feedback regulation of SFK, we employed a kinase-deficient mutant of Csk. Over-expression of a kinase-deficient Csk leads to activation of SFK (22Abrahamsen H. Vang T. Tasken K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17170-17177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23Torgersen K.M. Vang T. Abrahamsen H. Yaqub S. Horejsi V. Schraven B. Rolstad B. Mustelin T. Tasken K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29313-29318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 24Rengifo-Cam W. Konishi A. Morishita N. Matsuoka H Yamori T. Nada S. Okada M. Oncogene. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). To confirm this in our system, CskR222 with Arg replacing Lys-222 was tagged by CFP and co-expressed in COS1 cells with Cbp-YFP. As shown in Fig. 5A, the level of CFP-CskR222 in cell lysates and the amount co-immunoprecipitated with Cbp-YFP was greater than with endogenous Csk. Moreover, activation of SFK and tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbp was detected even without EGF stimulation and was sustained at a high level for up to 30 min after EGF stimulation. These results reveal that CFP-CskR222 acts in a dominant-negative fashion to induce the constitutive activation of SFK. We then analyzed YFP/CFP ratio images for CFP-CskR222/Cbp-YFP in living COS1 cells. When the cells were stimulated with EGF, an increased YFP/CFP emission ratio was detected at membrane ruffles even before EGF stimulation, and the effect intensified after EGF stimulation (Fig. 5B). It was sustained for 30 min, which is consistent with the prolonged activation of SFK. Photobleaching of YFP increased the CFP signals (data not shown). These in vitro and in vivo observations show that Csk is required at the membrane ruffles to shut off the transiently activated SFK, supporting the presence of negative feedback regulation of SFK during EGF signaling. Monitoring of SFK Activation with a Single-molecule FRET Indicator—The FRET signals obtained with the combination of CFP-Csk and Cbp-YFP provided evidence that EGF-induced activation of SFK, and Csk-mediated regulatory events, occur at membrane ruffles. Because activation of SFK always accompanies phosphorylation of Cbp, it seemed possible that FRET signals that depended upon phosphorylation of Cbp would be useful for monitoring the activity status of SFK without disturbing its function. We therefore constructed a single-molecule FRET probe by utilizing regions of Cbp containing membrane-localization signals and phosphorylation sites and the SH2 domain of Csk (Fig. 6A). We expected that, with this indicator (Chimera), the interaction between the Cbp substrate region and the SH2 domain of Csk would enhance FRET from the C terminus of CFP to the N terminus of YFP in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. In vitro spectrophotometric measurements revealed that the emission ratio for Chimera did increase in COS1 cells co-expressing Fyn or FynF528, whereas there was no FRET change when an F314Chimera lacking the Csk binding site was used (Fig. 6, C and D). Treatment with PP2 also removed the emission peak of Chimera at 527 nm (Fig. 6, C and D). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses of these cell lysates showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of Chimera was dependent upon the expression of Fyn or FynF528 (Fig. 6B), and that PP2-treatment suppressed SFK activity as well as phosphorylation of Chimera (Fig. 6B). These results demonstrate that the increase in the emission ratio of Chimera was caused by FRET, and that the FRET response was dependent upon the activity of SFK. The correlation between the activation of endogenous SFK and tyrosine phosphorylation of Chimera was further confirmed in cells stimulated with EGF. As shown in Fig. 7A, tyrosine phosphorylation of Chimera peaked 10 min after EGF stimulation in parallel with activation of SFK. In addition, pretreatment with PP2 suppressed both activation of SFK and tyrosine phosphorylation of Chimera (Fig. 7A, middle panel). In cells expressing F314Chimera, EGF stimulation activated SFK, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of F314Chimera was barely detected (Fig. 7A, right panel). We then attempted to obtain time-lapse images of SFK activation in living COS1 cells using Chimera. The cells were stimulated with EGF, and images of the YFP/CFP emission ratio were generated. An increase in the YFP/CFP emission ratio was observed at membrane ruffles upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 7B). FRET began to increase within 1 min, reached a plateau at about 10 min, and then returned to baseline. Photobleaching of YFP induced an increase in CFP emission (14Miyawaki A. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 17Schmid J.A. Sitte H.H. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2003; 15: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), indicating that the increase in YFP/CFP emission ratio was caused by FRET (data not shown). No increase in YFP/CFP emission ratio occurred upon EGF stimulation with the F314Chimera or after treatment with PP2 (Fig. 7, C and D). These results demonstrate that the YFP/CFP emission ratio of Chimera reflects the activation of endogenous SFK at membrane ruffles. GFP-based FRET technology is increasingly being used to visualize intracellular signaling in living cells (21Mochizuki N. Yamashita S. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Nagai T. Miyawaki A. Matsuda M.

With this technique we have examined the interaction between Csk (a negative regulatory kinase for SFK) and Cbp (a transmembrane protein that can recruit Csk when phosphorylated by SFK). We have also analyzed when and where SFK is activated and regulated in living cells. The results reported above clearly show that the observed FRET signals represent the direct interaction of Csk and Cbp in living cells. It was shown previously through biochemical analyses that Cbp phosphorylated by SFK is involved in the membrane localization of Csk and the Csk-mediated down-regulation of SFKs (8Kawabuchi M.

However, there has been no direct evidence for the presence of such a regulatory system in living cells. In this study, we showed that the active Csk was indeed recruited to Cbp when phosphorylated by SFK; its rapid dissociation from the complex was followed by a loss of SFK activity. These ordered reactions support the occurrence of negative feedback regulation of SFK in living cells. To further verify the contribution of Csk, our FRET analysis showed that Csk activity is required for the feedback regulation of SFK that leads to prompt termination of SFK signaling. The use of two FRET indicators showed that Csk is transiently recruited to membrane ruffles in which Cbp is phosphorylated by SFK upon EGF stimulation. When activated by EGF, the EGF receptor accumulates in lipid rafts that are harbored in membrane ruffles (31Sorkin A. McClure M. Huang F. Carter R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1395-1398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 32Wiley H.S. Exp.

Cbp, co-localized with SFK in lipid rafts, is also enriched in membrane ruffles upon EGF stimulation, and its phosphorylation status is consistent with the activity status of SFK. Furthermore, in vitro studies show that Cbp is an excellent substrate for SFK (33Takeuchi S. Takayama Y. Ogawa A. Tamura K. Okada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29183-29186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that the phosphorylation of Cbp is a hallmark of SFK activation, and that the Cbp-Csk interaction represents, albeit indirectly, the activity status of SFK at the exact locations where SFK signaling is taking place. These considerations led us to expect that the FRET indicators could be used to monitor the activity of SFK in vivo. However, because the observations with the kinase-defective Csk showed that the two molecular indicators are functional and sometimes affect cellular events, we constructed a single-molecule FRET probe using the interaction between the phosphorylated Tyr-314 of Cbp and the SH2 domain of Csk. The FRET signal from this indicator accurately reflected the activation of SFK in vitro, and the time-lapse images of its FRET signals were almost equivalent to those obtained with the Cbp-YFP/CFP-Csk indicators. This result demonstrates that this single-molecule indicator can detect the status of SFK in living cells. We are now examining the use of this indicator for detecting other SFK signaling events in lipid rafts, such as cell adhesion signaling mediated by integrins. Src can physically associate with the EGF receptor when activated by EGF stimulation (34Luttrell D.K. Lee A. Lansing T.J. Crosby R.M. Jung K.D. Willard D. Luther M. Rodriguez M. Berman J. Gilmer T.M.

However, the nature of this interaction and the physiological role of Src activation in EGF signaling remain unclear. Recently, mechanisms by which SFK may affect ligand-induced endocytosis of the EGF receptor have been proposed (37Wilde A. Beattie E.C. Lem L. Riethof D.A. Liu S.H. Mobley W.C. Soriano P. Brodsky F.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 677-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 38Ahn S. Kim J. Lucaveche C.L. Reedy M.C. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 27433-27441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For example, it has been shown that the activation of SFK upon EGF stimulation regulates clathrin phosphorylation and its redistribution to the cell periphery (37Wilde A. Beattie E.C. Lem L. Riethof D.A. Liu S.H. Mobley W.C. Soriano P. Brodsky F.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 677-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), and that Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin increases its self-assembly into helically interconnected rings and also stimulates the rate of GTP hydrolysis. Both of these processes are necessary for the dynamin-induced budding of vesicles from the plasma membrane (38Ahn S. Kim J. Lucaveche C.L. Reedy M.C. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26642-26651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanism still remains uncertain, it is likely that the activation of SFK is important for ligand-induced endocytosis of the EGF receptor. We have observed that, upon EGF stimulation, the EGF receptor and Cbp in lipid rafts accumulate at membrane ruffles, integrate into small vesicle-like structures, and subsequently move into perinuclear compartments (data not shown). However, FRET signals were obtained only at the membrane ruffles. These observations suggest that SFK activation is required for the initial step of receptor endocytosis. We are now seeking the SFK target that triggers receptor endocytosis. In this study, we showed that Csk was specifically recruited to phosphorylated Cbp upon EGF stimulation. However, it was previously reported that other SFK targets such as paxillin and FAK could recruit Csk to a location where they were phosphorylated by SFK (6Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Thus it may be that multiple and/or complementary negative feedback loops regulate SFK. To separate these multiple systems and evaluate the role of each, more specific indicators containing a specific localization signal and a stable Csk binding site should be designed. In this study, we developed a single indicator to visualize the activity status of SFK. Because Cbp is exclusively localized at lipid rafts, this indicator should be useful for monitoring SFK signaling originating from lipid rafts, such as EGF and T-cell receptors, and cell adhesion signaling. The progression of some human cancers is associated with the elevated expression and activity of SFK (41Cartwright C.A. Kamps M.P. Meisler A.I. Pipas J.M. Eckhart W. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 2025-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 42Talamonti M.S. Roh M.S. Curley S.A. Gallick G.E. J. Clin.

Invest. 1994; 93: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that the metastatic activity of cancer cells in particular can be defined by the status of their SFK activity (24Rengifo-Cam W. Konishi A. Morishita N. Matsuoka H Yamori T. Nada S. Okada M. Oncogene. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). If an indicator that precisely reflected this status could be designed, it would be very useful for screening drugs that decrease the deregulated activity of SFK. Meanwhile, the substrate-based indicator for SFK activity used above should be useful for investigating the regulation of SFK in a variety of cellular processes, although further improvements may be necessary.

This event is attributed to a transient Ca2+ release from internal stores and Ca2+ entry from extracellular compartment. Store-operated Ca2+ channels are defined the channels activated in response to store depletion. In the present study, we determined whether epidermal growth factor activated store-operated Ca2+ channels and further, whether depletion of internal Ca2+ stores was required for the epidermal growth factor-induced Ca2+ entry in human glomerular mesangial cells. We found that 100 nm epidermal growth factor activated a Ca2+-permeable channel that had identical biophysical and pharmacological properties to channels activated by 1 μm thapsigargin in human glomerular mesangial cells or A431 cells. The epidermal growth factor-induced Ca2+ currents were completely abolished by a selective phospho-lipase C inhibitor, U73122. However, xestospongin C, a specific inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor inhibitor, did not affect the membrane currents elicited by epidermal growth factor despite a slight reduction in background currents. Following emptying of internal Ca2+ stores by thapsigargin, epidermal growth factor still potentiated the Ca2+ currents as determined by the whole-cell patch configuration. Furthermore, epidermal growth factor failed to trigger measurable Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum. However, another physiological agent linked to phospholipase C and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate cascade, angiotensin II, produced a striking Ca2+ transient.

Cytosolic Ca2+ represents a convergent point of many signal transduction pathways and modulates a diverse array of cellular activities ranging from contraction to cell growth. Cells generate Ca2+ signals through both internal and external Ca2+ sources. In terms of external source, one mechanism for controlling Ca2+ entry involves the classical phosphoinositide pathway. Essentially, the binding of many hormones to G-protein-coupled receptors or tyrosine kinase-based receptors on the plasma membrane leads to activation of phospholipase C (PLC) 1The abbreviations used are: PLCphospholipase CIP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphophateIP3RIP3 receptorSOCstore-operated Ca2+ channelEGFepidermal growth factorEGFREGF receptorHMChuman glomerular mesangial cellsTGthapsigarginAng IIangiotensin II.1The abbreviations used are: PLCphospholipase CIP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphophateIP3RIP3 receptorSOCstore-operated Ca2+ channelEGFepidermal growth factorEGFREGF receptorHMChuman glomerular mesangial cellsTGthapsigarginAng IIangiotensin II. β or γ that hydrolyzes membrane lipids to produce inositol 1,4,5-trisphophate (IP3). IP3 binds to the IP3 receptor located on the membrane of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and subsequently stimulates release of Ca2+ from the lumen of ER to the cytoplasm. This release of Ca2+ is generally associated with an increase in Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane, a process known as store-operated or capacitative Ca2+ entry through a specific type of Ca2+ channel termed store-operated Ca2+ channel (SOC) (1Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 2Putney J.W. Mckay R.R. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In addition to the ubiquitous capcitative Ca2+ entry mechanism, non-capacitative Ca2+ entry involving the PLC-IP3 cascade has also been described in a variety of cell types (3Vazquez G. Wedel B.J.

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) mediates its effects on normal cell function via the activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a typical tyrosine kinase receptor. Binding of EGF to its receptor results in the increased phosphorylation of a group of substrates, one of which is PLC-γ (5Rane S.G. Adv.

Activated PLC-γ then catalyzes the production of IP3 and diacylglycerol. The earliest cellular responses to the activation of the EGFR includes a number of ionic changes, such as an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) (5Rane S.G. Adv.

Some of these responses have been linked to the PLC cascade (5Rane S.G. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 107-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The EGF-induced rise in [Ca2+]i is derived from the activation of both release from ER (triggered by IP3) and Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane (5Rane S.G. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 107-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G.J. de Laat S.W. J. Biol.

We previously found that EGF activated Ca2+-permeable channels that possessed similar biophysical and pharmacological properties to those of SOC at single channel level in human glomerular mesangial cells (HMC) (9Ma R. Sansom S.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 47-53PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ma R. Smith S. Child A. Carmines P.K. Sansom S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F954-F961Google Scholar). However, it remains uncertain whether the EGF-evoked Ca2+ influx is dependent on store depletion or other second messengers activated in response to EGF. In this study, we provide electrophysiological and pharmacological evidence that EGF activates SOC by a PLC-dependent but IP3 receptor (IP3R) independent pathway in HMC. Preparation of Cultures of Mesangial Cells—The procedures and methods for culturing HMC were described previously (11Hall D. Carmines P.K. Sansom S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F97-F103Google Scholar). Briefly, HMC were cultured in Dulbelco's modified eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, 2.0 mm glutamine, 0.66 unit/ml insulin, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 20% fetal bovine serum. The pH value of the medium was adjusted to the level between 7.2 and 7.4. Upon reaching confluence, cells were passed onto 22×22-1 mm cover glasses (Fisher Scientific), which were served as the floor of the perfusion chamber (Warner RC-2OH, 23 °C) used in either patch clamp or fura-2 experiments. All cells were studied within 56 h after plated and only subpassages less than eleven generations were used in the present study. Patch Clamp Procedures—The conventional whole-cell and cell-attached voltage clamp configurations were performed in single HMC cells at room temperature with a Warner PC-505B (for whole-cell) or Warner PC-501A (for cell-attached) amplifier (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) and pClamp software (Axon Instrument, Foster City, CA). Glass pipettes (plain, Fisher Scientific) with resistances of 5-8 MΩ were prepared with a pipette puller and polisher (PP-830 and MF-830, respectively, Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). Single Channel Analysis—Single channel analysis was performed using standard patch clamp techniques (11Hall D. Carmines P.K. Sansom S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F97-F103Google Scholar, 12Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sackmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfuegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15118) Google Scholar, 13Stockand J.D. Sansom S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1080-C1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data were digitized for single channel analysis using an analog-to-digital interface (Axon Instruments) and recorded by a computer system. Low pass filter was set at 500 Hz. The unitary current, defined as zero for the closed state (C), was determined as the mean of the best-fit Gaussian distribution of the amplitude histograms. Channels were considered to be in an open state (O) when the total current (I) was >(n - 1/2)I and <(n + 1/2)I, where n is the maximum number of current levels observed. The open probability (PO) was defined as the time spent in an open state divided by the total time of the analyzed record. When multiple channels occupied a patch, the channel activity was calculated as NPO = ΣnPn, where Pn is the probability of finding n channels open. Therefore, NPO could be calculated without making assumptions about the total number of channels in a patch or the open probability of individual single channels. The Axoscope acquisition program and pClamp program set 6.02 (Axon Instruments) were used to record and analyze currents. Whole-cell Patch—When the whole-cell configuration was achieved, cell capacitance and series resistance were compensated before each recording period. From a holding potential of 0 mV, voltage steps were applied from -80 to 80 mV in 20 mV increments with 100 ms duration at 5-s intervals. Current traces were filtered at 1 kHz and analyzed off-line with pClamp and statistical (SigmaPlot/SigmaStat, Chicago, IL) software. Measurement of [Ca2+]i—[Ca2+]i was monitored in HMC using fura-2 and dual excitation wavelength fluorescence microscopy, as described previously (14Carmines P.K. Fowler B.C. Bell P.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F677-F685PubMed Google Scholar, 15Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were loaded with fura-2 by incubation for 60 min (23 °C) in physiological saline solution containing 7 μm fura-2 AM, 0.09 g/dl Me2SO and 0.018 g/dl Pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After loading with fura-2, HMC were placed in a perfusion chamber mounted on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot-300 inverted microscope. With light provided by a DeltaScan dual monochromator system (Photon Technology International, Monmouth Junction, NJ), the cells were illuminated alternately at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm (bandwidth = 3 nm). To limit detection of emitted fluorescence (510 nm; 20-nm bandpass) to that emitted from a single cell, an adjustable optical sampling window was positioned within the light path upstream from the photon-counting photomultiplier. Background-corrected data were collected at a rate of 5 points/s, stored, and analyzed by using the FeliX software package (Photon Technologies). Calibration of the fura-2 signal was performed according to established methods described previously (14Carmines P.K. Fowler B.C. Bell P.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F677-F685PubMed Google Scholar, 15Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In certain experiments (see figure legend to Fig. 3, E and F), ratiometric fluorescence was detected and analyzed using MetaFluor imaging system (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). In all fura-2 experiments, the initial bathing solution contained (in mm): 135 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, and 1 CaCl2. Solutions and Chemicals—For cell-attached patches, the bathing solution contained (in mm): 135 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 2 MgCl2, and 1 CaCl2 (pH 7.4). The pipette solution contained 90 mm BaCl2 plus 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). In whole-cell patches for HMC, the bathing solution contained (in mm): 110 NaCl, 5 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 20 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose (pH 7.4). The pipette solution contained (in mm): 135 cesium methane sulfonate, 8 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.3 Mg-ATP, 0.03 GTP, 10 HEPES, and 10 EGTA (pH 7.2). For A431 cells, the bathing solution contained (in mm): 70 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 25 BaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 5 glucose, and 2 EGTA (pH 7.4). The pipette solution contained (in mm): 140 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 20 EGTA, and 1.3 ATP (pH 7.4). In fura-2 experiments, two types of bathing solutions were used, 1 mm Ca2+ solution which has the same component as the bathing solution for cell-attached patch and Ca2+ free solution in which the Ca2+ concentration was adjusted to less than 1 μm by buffering with EGTA calculated by MTK Software. EGF, U73122, and thapsigargin were purchased from Calbiochem. Xestospongin C, lanthanum chloride, diltiazem, angiotensin II, and cadmium were obtained from Sigma. Statistical Analysis—In cell-attached patch clamp experiments, all NPO values were calculated from 10 s of single channel recording. Whenever possible, experiments were conducted in a paired fashion, with each patch acting as its own control. In these cases, the average change in NPO for a group of experiments, compared before and after an experimental treatment, was analyzed using a paired t test. In all experiments, one-way analysis of variance and one-way repeated measures analysis of variance followed by Student-Newman-Keuls tests were used for comparisons among multiple groups and sequential treatments in one group, respectively. Data are reported as means ± S.E.; n is the number of cells. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using SigmaStat (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). EGF Activated Store-operated Ca2+ Entry—In whole-cell configuration, store-operated Ca2+ currents were induced using a specific inhibitor of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase, thapsigargin (TG). Fig. 1A, panel a, shows whole-cell currents before and after application of 1 μm TG generated by step voltages (see “Experimental Procedures”). Under basal condition (before TG), background currents were observed at all tested potentials, suggesting a tonic activity of the channels. Both inward and outward currents were greatly enhanced by TG within 1-3 min, indicating a store-operated property. Current-voltage relations plotted by current density (normalized to cell capacitance) at 50 ms after establishing whole-cell configuration against test potentials from six cells exhibit a slight inward rectification from -80 mV to -40 mV, and the currents were reversed around 20 mV for both before and after TG (Fig. 1A, panel b), implying a slight selectivity of this channel to Ca2+. TG significantly augmented inward currents from -80 mV to -40 mV and outward currents at 80 mV with ∼222% increments at -80 mV (Fig. 1A, panel c). To further determine the store-operated nature of the channel, the TG-induced responses were re-evaluated in the presence of La3+, a widely used blocker for SOC (10Ma R. Smith S. Child A. Carmines P.K. Sansom S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F954-F961Google Scholar, 16Yue L.X. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E.

Cell. 2002; 111: 529-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It is clearly shown that 20 μm La3+ completely abolished the TG-evoked increase in cell currents and even lowered the currents below basal level (by ∼23.3%, p > 0.05) (Fig. 1A, panel c). Similar to TG, 100 nm EGF also increased whole-cell currents (Fig. 1B, panel a) and the responses reached significant level from -80 mV to -20 mV and from 60 mV to 80 mV (Fig. 1B, panel b). The I-V curves reveal an almost identical I-V relations and reversal potentials to those observed in TG-treated cells (Fig. 1A, panel b, and B, panel b). At -80 mV test potential, EGF raised the current density from -10.5 ± 3.1 pA/pF to -23.3 ± 6.3 pA/pF, representing 274.6 ± 40.6% of background current (Fig. 1B, panel c). This EGF-induced response was also abolished by 20 μm La3+ (Fig. 1B, panel c). The EGF-activated Ca2+ conductance was further examined using fura-2 fluorescence measurement. In this series of experiments, a Ca2+-readmission protocol was employed to assess capacitative Ca2+ entry (10Ma R. Smith S. Child A. Carmines P.K. Sansom S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F954-F961Google Scholar). In nominally Ca2+-free extracellular solution, base-line intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in all tested cells were in the range from 20 to 50 nm (Fig. 2A, panel a). Replacing the bathing solution with 1 mm Ca2+ solution only slightly elevated [Ca2+]i. However, under condition of preincubation with 100 nm EGF for 3-5 min, admission of Ca2+ resulted in a striking increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2A, panels a and b, Control). The EGF-induced response was partially but insignificantly attenuated by 5 μm diltiazem but almost completely abolished by 2 μm La3+ (Fig. 2A, panels a and b). The difference between basal [Ca2+]i and peak [Ca2+]i in response to addition of Ca2+ (Δ[Ca2+]i) was well known to be derived from Ca2+ influx (4Zhang B.X. Ma X.Y. Yeh C.K. Lifschitz M.D. Zhu M.X.

Summary data for each group are presented in Fig. 2A, panel b, clearly showing that EGF significantly enhanced Ca2+ entry, and this enhancement was not significantly depressed by diltiazem and Cd2+ but abolished by La3+. Since both diltiazem and Cd2+ are selective blockers for voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in the range of concentrations used in the current study (11Hall D. Carmines P.K. Sansom S.C. Am. J.

Pharmacol. 1989; 14: S49-S58Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we infer that the EGF-evoked Ca2+ entry is unlikely to be predominantly mediated by voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, if any present in these cells. Thus, another type of channel, SOC, might play a major role in mediating the Ca2+ influx induced by EGF. To further determine whether EGF is capable of activating SOC, whole-cell currents were measured in A431 cells, a human epidermoid cancer cell line. We chose this cell line because of two reasons: 1) A431 cells are rich in EGF receptors (20Wahl M. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7581-7590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 2) whole-cell currents of SOC in this cell line are unique in that they show strong inward rectification and high Ba2+ conductance (21Lückhoff A. Clapham D.E. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 177-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We measured Ba2+ whole-cell currents in responses to EGF in six A431 cells and compared those with TG-induced currents. As shown in Fig. 2B, background currents were small and were inwardly rectified until they were reversed (at about 40 mV). These inward currents were significantly enhanced by TG or EGF without altering current-voltage relationships and reversal potentials. The EGF-sensitive currents are similar to TG-sensitive currents in terms of shape of current-voltage curves and reversal potentials (Fig. 2B, panel c), indicating that the EGF-activated currents were mediated through SOC. EGF-induced Ca2+ Entry Was Dependent on PLC but Independent on IP3Receptor—Next, we aimed to determine whether the EGF-induced response was mediated by PLC activation and IP3 generation using a membrane-permeable PLC inhibitor, U73122. A 3-5-min preincubation of cells with 10 μm U73122 has been demonstrated to fully and irreversibly prevent PLC activation upon agonist stimulation in smooth muscle cells (22Broad L.M. Cannon T.R. Taylor C.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 517: 121-134Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Likewise, a 3-min pretreatment of HMC with 10 μm U73122 was sufficient to depress the EGF-activated Ca2+ current in cell-attached mode. As shown in Fig. 3A, administration of 100 nm EGF to the bath raised NPO of the Ca2+ channels from 1.06 ± 0.08 to 1.55 ± 0.11 (p < 0.05), and this activation was not observed in the presence of 10 μm U73122. However, U73122 itself did not affect the base-line activity of the channels. Taken together, these data suggested that PLC activation was an essential step in the EGF-mediated activation of SOCs. Because PLC activation is upstream of IP3 production and intracellular store depletion, and EGF-activated channels had similar properties to SOCs, we reasoned that IP3 generation might be an essential step in the EGF-activated Ca2+ conductance. If this was the case, blocking IP3R function should partially or completely attenuate the Ca2+ entry induced by EGF. Xestospongin C is a potent membrane permeable IP3R inhibitor (23Gafni J. Munsch J.A. Lam T.H. Catlin M.C. Costa L.G. Molinski T.F. Pessah I.N. Neuron. 1997; 19: 723-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) and has been widely used to investigate the role of IP3R in a variety of intracellular signaling pathways (3Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Bird G.S. Joseph S.K. Putney Jr., J.W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 24Miyamoto S. Izumi M. Hori M. Kobayashi M. Ozaki H. Karaki H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 650-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). HMC were preincubated with 10 μm xestospongin C for 30 min, and whole-cell currents generated from step voltages were measured before and after application of EGF. Basal currents were greatly reduced under treatment with xestospongin C (Fig. 3, B and D), suggesting that endogenous IP3R activity in the resting state may regulate the activity of Ca2+ permeant channels. Interestingly, in the presence of xestospongin C, EGF still increased membrane conductance at all tested potentials (Fig. 3C), and the responses reached significant levels from -80 mV to -40 mV and from 40 mV to 80 mV (Fig. 3D). Specifically, at -80 mV, the EGF-induced current was 282.6 ± 39.9% of background levels (Fig. 3D, inset), comparable with the EGF-evoked enhancement in the absence of xestospongin C (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that IP3R function is not required for the EGF-induced activation of Ca2+-conducting channels. To assure that PLC and IP3R were efficiently depressed by U73122 and xestospongin C, respectively, angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced Ca2+ release from ER was examined in the presence or absence of the two inhibitors. Ang II has been demonstrated to mobilize intracellular Ca2+ through PLC and IP3R pathway in glomerular mesangial cells (11Hall D. Carmines P.K. Sansom S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F97-F103Google Scholar, 25Madhun Z.T. Ernsberger P. Ke F.C. Zhou J. Hopfer U. Douglas J.G. Regul. Pept. 1993; 44: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3E, Ang II triggered a clear rise of cytosolic Ca2+, which, apparently, was originated from internal Ca2+ stores because the cell was bathed in nominally Ca2+ free solution. The Ang II-stimulated Ca2+ release was nearly abolished by pretreating HMC with 10 μm U73122 (3 min) or 10 μm xestospongin C (30 min) (Fig. 3, E and F). Interestingly, the basal intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) was significantly lowered by U73122 or xestospongin C treatment (Fig. 3F), suggesting that the tonic activity of endogenous PLC and IP3R might play a role in Ca2+ homeostasis under resting state. Effect of Depletion of Internal Ca2+ Stores on EGF-activated Membrane Currents—To further test whether the cascade of IP3-IP3R-depletion of ER contributes to the EGF-induced responses, the effect of EGF on membrane currents were re-evaluated after depleting intracellular Ca2+ stores by TG in cell-attached and whole-cell patch modes. Single channel recordings (Fig. 4A) revealed that even though the channel number (three in this particular experiment) did not increase after TG, the opening time of the channels was greatly prolonged. This prolongation was further potentiated by addition of EGF. Summary data show that the NPO of the channels significantly increased after administration of TG and was further significantly raised by EGF (Fig. 4B). In whole-cell patch configuration, inward current at -80 mV was significantly enhanced by TG from -6.4 ± 1.9 pA/pF to -14.3 ± 3.1 pA/pF. Under this circumstance, EGF still resulted in an additional and significant increase in inward current (-27.6 ± 6.4 pA/pF). Again, the TG- and EGF-activated currents were abolished by 20 μm La3+ (-5.6 ± 1.8 pA/pF) (Fig. 4C). In sum, the single channel and whole-cell current measurements exibited that depletion of internal Ca2+ stores did not impact the EGF-induced ionic conductance, strongly suggesting that the EGF-evoked conductance is independent of store depletion. Effect of EGF on Ca2+ Release Transient—To further test the store depletion dependence of EGF-induced Ca2+ entry, we examined whether EGF could efficiently empty the internal Ca2+ pools in HMC. To this end, cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in response to EGF was assessed using fura-2 fluorescence measurement. As a positive control, TG was employed and a rapid Ca2+ transient was observed immediately after applying TG (Fig. 5A), consistent with our previous report (10Ma R. Smith S. Child A. Carmines P.K. Sansom S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F954-F961Google Scholar). However, this transient was not observed in the cell challenged with 100 nm EGF. The rise in [Ca2+]i was sluggish and low (Fig. 5B). Ang II, another physiological agent, also led to a striking Ca2+ spike, which has been known to originate from IP3-triggered Ca2+ release from ER (Fig. 5C) (11Hall D. Carmines P.K. Sansom S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F97-F103Google Scholar), implying that the PLC-IP3 pathway is functional. The differences of peak [Ca2+]i from basal level (Δ[Ca2+]i) in each group are summarized in Fig. 5D, showing a significant difference in Ca2+ release between TG or angiotensin II treatment and EGF treatment. These data show that while the PLC-IP3 pathway was fully functional in these cells, EGF failed to activate a measurable Ca2+ release. It has been documented that EGF-stimulated Ca2+ release from ER varies with cell types (4Zhang B.X. Ma X.Y. Yeh C.K. Lifschitz M.D. Zhu M.X. Katz M.S. J. Biol.

These results were consistent with the results obtained from xestospongin C experiment showing that store depletion was unlikely to account for activat"

It is characterized by the presence of a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-binding FYVE domain positioned in the middle of the molecule. To determine its potential effectors or binding partners, we used the carboxyl-terminal half of endofin as bait to screen a human brain cDNA library in a yeast two-hybrid system. Three clones that encode TOM1 were recovered. TOM1 is a protein closely related to the VHS (VPS-27, Hrs, and STAM) domain-containing GGA family. Although the function of the GGAs in mediating Golgi to lysosomal trafficking is well established, the subcellular localization and function of TOM1 remain unknown. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays as well as co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that the carboxyl-terminal half of endofin binds specifically to the carboxyl-terminal region of TOM1. Neither SARA nor Hrs, two other FYVE domain proteins, interact with this region of TOM1. Moreover, endofin does not interact with the analogous region of two other members of the TOM1 protein family, namely, TOM1-like 1 (TOM1-L1) or TOM1-like 2 (TOM1-L2). The carboxyl-terminal region of TOM1 was used as immunogen to generate TOM1-specific antibody. This antibody can distinguish TOM1 from the other family members as well as coimmunoprecipitate endogenous endofin. It also revealed the primarily cytosolic distribution of TOM1 in a variety of cell types by immunofluorescence analyses. In addition, sucrose density gradient analysis showed that both TOM1 and endofin can be detected in cellular compartments marked by the early endosomal marker EEA1.

Endofin is a member of the FYVE domain family of proteins. The FYVE finger domain (1Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.-H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) is involved in interaction with the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, which is found in significant levels on endosomal membranes (2Gillooly D.J. Morrow I.C. Lindsay M. Gould R. Bryant N.J. Gaullier J.-M. Parton R.G. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). In many instances, therefore, the FYVE domain serves to localize the protein containing it to endosomes. In endofin, the FYVE domain appears to be necessary and sufficient to localize the protein to early endosomes (3Seet L.-F. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42445-42454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The FYVE domain is a modular motif that can function independent of its position on the molecular structure. In the case of endofin, the FYVE domain sits in the middle of the molecule, thereby effectively dividing the molecule into two halves. Apart from a few exceptions like the proteins FGD1 (faciogenital dysplasia gene product 1) (4Estrada L. Caron E. Gorski J.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), Frabin (5Obaishi H. Nakanishi H. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A. Takahashi K. Miyahara M. Nishioka H. Takaishi K. Takai Y. J. Biol.

Manifava M. Ellson C.D. Lipp P. Bootman M. Coadwell J. Nazarian A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Cooper M.A. Thuring J.W. Lim Z.Y. Holmes A.B. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3991-4000PubMed Google Scholar), members of the mammalian FYVE domain family have, in general, two characteristics in common: the presence of the FYVE domain and the consequential location of the proteins on endosomal membranes. The presence of these proteins on endosomal structures imply that they have roles in trafficking and/or signaling involving endosomes. The nature of their specific roles is thought to be dependent on the structural information encoded by the sequences of the proteins outside of the FYVE domain. These sequences may encode for catalytic activities as in PIKfyve (phosphoinositide kinase with specificity for five position containing a fyve finger), which is a phosphoinositide 5-kinase (7Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and FYVE-DSP1 and 2 (FYVE dual-specificity protein phosphatases 1 and 2), which are dual specificity protein phosphatases that can also dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (8Zhao R. Qi Y. Zhao Z.J. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 222-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 9Zhao R. Qi Y. Chen J. Zhao Z.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The FYVE domain flanking or adjacent sequences may also represent binding sites for downstream effector molecules or binding partners. In these cases, identifying the interacting partners is crucial to an understanding of the specific functions of individual FYVE domain proteins. To this end, the functions of a few members of the FYVE domain protein family are becoming clearer because of the identification of their interacting partners. The prototype FYVE domain protein, EEA1 (early endosome autoantigen 1) (10Mu F.-T. Callaghan J.M. Steele-Mortimer O. Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Campbell P.L. McCluskey J. Yeo J.-P. Tock E.P.C. Toh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13503-13511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar) is the most extensively characterized. EEA1 consists of an amino-terminal C2H2 Zn2+ finger, four heptad repeats, and a carboxyl-terminal region containing a calmodulin-binding (IQ) motif and a FYVE domain. EEA1 has been shown to bind to Rab22 through its amino-terminal region (11Kauppi M. Simonsen A. Bremnes B. Vieira A. Callaghan J. Stenmark H. Oikkonen V.M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 899-911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is known to associate with Rab5 through both the amino-terminal region as well as an additional binding site in its carboxyl-terminal region (12Simonsen A. Lippé R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.-M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.-H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). The IQ domain has been shown to be required for binding to calmodulin (13Mills I.G. Urbé S. Clague M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1956-1965Google Scholar). In addition, it has been demonstrated to interact with two SNAREs, 1The abbreviations used are: SNAREsoluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptorGSTglutathione S-transferaseHAhemagglutinin. Syntaxin 6 and Syntaxin 13, at its carboxyl terminus (13Mills I.G. Urbé S. Clague M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1956-1965Google Scholar, 14McBride H.M. Rybin V. Murphy C. Giner A. Teasdale R.

The discovery of the association between EEA1 and multiple proteins involved in endosome fusion has thus cemented the importance of this molecule in regulating the endosome fusion pathway (16Christoforidis S. McBride H.M. Burgoyne R.D. Zerial M. Nature. 1999; 397: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Another well characterized FYVE domain protein is the Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate) (17Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Like EEA1, Hrs contains multiple domains: an amino-terminal VHS domain, a FYVE domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a clathrin-binding domain. The aminoterminal region before the coiled-coil domain is found to bind to Eps15, a protein required for receptor-mediated endocytosis via interactions with α-adaptin (18Bean A.J. Davanger S. Chou M.F. Gerhardt B. Tsujimoto S. Chang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15271-15278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The Hrs coiled-coil domain and the carboxyl-terminal region have in turn been shown to bind to a variety of molecules: STAM1 and STAM2, which are downstream effectors of the Janus kinases in cytokine signaling (19Asao H. Sasaki Y. Arita T. Tanaka N. Endo K. Kasai H. Takeshita T. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32785-32791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar); the SNARE protein SNAP-25, which is a component of the complexes involved in vesicle docking and fusion (20Kwong J. Roudabush F.L. Moore P.H. Montague M. Oldham W. Li Y. Chin L.-S. Li L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2273-2284PubMed Google Scholar); the Smad proteins, which are effector molecules that transmit signals from the transforming growth factor receptor β to the nucleus (21Miura S. Takeshita T. Asao H. Kimura Y. Murata K. Sasaki Y. Hanai J.-I. Beppu H. Tsukazaki T. Wrana J.L. Miyazono K. Sugamura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9346-9355Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar); and SNX1 (sorting nexin 1), which is involved in lysosomal trafficking (22Chin L.-S. Raynor M.C. Wei X. Chen H.-Q. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7069-7078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The clathrin-binding domain of Hrs is functional and has been reported to interact directly with the clathrin heavy chain (23Raiborg C. Bache K.G. Mehlum A. Stang E. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5008-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In addition, Hrs contains a ubiquitin-interacting motif where it binds directly to ubiquitin (24Hofmann K. Falquet L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 347-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 25Raiborg C. Bache K.G. Gillooly D.J. Madshus I.H. Stang E. Stenmark H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) as well as a PSAP motif that facilitates interaction with the ESCRT-I subunit Tsg101 (26Bache K.G. Brech A. Mehlum A. Stenmark H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 27Lu Q. Hope L.W. Brasch M. Reinhard C. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). From the identification of the multiple interacting partners for Hrs, it can be envisioned that the protein is likely to bridge signal transduction and regulation of the trafficking event that sorts ubiquitinated proteins from endosomes to the degradative pathway (29Raiborg C. Stenmark H. Cell Struct. Funct. 2002; 27: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Similarly, SARA, another FYVE domain-containing protein, is likely to be involved in both signaling events and intracellular trafficking. SARA contains a binding site known as the Smad-binding domain that interacts with both Smad2 and Smad3 (30Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Downstream transforming growth factor receptor β signal transduction is not only dependent on this interaction, it also requires that SARA is properly localized on endosomes (31Hayes S. Chawla A. Corvera S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and that endosome function was not disrupted (32Panopoulou E. Gillooly D.J. Wrana J.L. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Murphy C. Fotsis T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18046-18052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Other FYVE domain proteins that have been ascribed specific roles based on their interacting partners have also been described. Rabenosyn5 interacts directly with Rab5 and hence, like EEA1, is a component of the Rab5 effector complex(es) (33Nielsen E. Christoforidis S. Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Miaczynska M. Dewitte F. Wilm M. Hoflack B. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The mouse FYVE domain protein Rabip4 (Rab 4-interacting protein) was originally isolated as a downstream effector of Rab4, a small GTPase implicated in regulating endocytosis (34Cormont M. Mari M. Galmiche A. Hofman P. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1637-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). More recently, the human ortholog of Rabip4, designated RUFY1 (RUN and FYVE-domain-containing protein 1), has been reported to bind to epithelial and endothelial tyrosine kinase, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase. This interaction suggests again the coupling of endocytosis and the regulation of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, cell motility, and apoptosis (35Yang J. Kim O. Wu J. Qiu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30219-30226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor glutathione S-transferase hemagglutinin. In this report, we describe the identification of an endofin binding protein, TOM1, from a yeast two-hybrid screen. We demonstrate the interaction of endofin with TOM1 by both in vitro and in vivo methods. We also show that endofin interacts with TOM1 via its carboxyl-terminal half. Coincidentally, it is the carboxyl-terminal region of TOM1 that is responsible for binding to endofin. We provide evidence that although TOM1 appears to be a cytoplasmic protein by immunofluorescence analysis, its distribution does partially co-localize with that of endofin by density gradient analysis. Overexpression of endofin has a significant impact on TOM1 localization as we show that endofin can cause a shift of TOM1 distribution onto the endosomes. These data provide evidence for a role of endofin in regulating the distribution of TOM1 as well as the potential involvement of TOM1 in endosomal function. Plasmid Constructs—The full-length cDNAs of human TOM1, TOM1-like 1 (TOM1-L1) and TOM1-like 2 (TOM1-L2), were cloned by PCR from a human fetal brain Marathon cDNA library (Clontech), whereas the Hrs cDNA was cloned from a human kidney Marathon cDNA library (Clontech). The full-length TOM1 cDNA was subsequently cloned into the vector pFLAG-CMV2 (Sigma-Aldrich), behind the FLAG peptide sequence, for transient expression in mammalian cells. The truncated TOM1, TOM1-L1, or TOM-L2 constructs were also generated by PCR and cloned into the pGEX-4T vector (Amersham Biosciences) for expression in Escherichia coli. The cDNA encoding the endofin fragment from amino acids 815–1539 was generated by PCR and cloned into the pDMycneo vector as for the other endofin constructs described previously (3Seet L.-F. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42445-42454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The cDNA coding for the carboxyl-terminal half of endofin from amino acids 806–1539 was generated by PCR and cloned into the vector pGBKT7. The resulting GAL4-endofin (806–1539) fusion construct was used as a bait for screening a human brain cDNA Matchmaker GAL4 yeast two-hybrid library (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Culture and Transient Expression—293T, A431, HeLa, BHK21, Chinese hamster ovary, and NRK cells were grown as described previously (3Seet L.-F. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42445-42454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Transfection of the cells for transient expression was carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) for about 5 h according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were then processed for subsequent GST pull-down assays, immunoprecipitation experiments, or immunofluorescence analysis 48 h post-transfection. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—The cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting were carried out as described previously (3Seet L.-F. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42445-42454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous TOM1 and endofin, A431 cell lysate was incubated with 20 μg of either anti-TOM1 or anti-endofin antibody as well as 20 μl (bed volume) of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C overnight. After washing several times with lysis buffer, bound proteins were analyzed as before (13Mills I.G. Urbé S. Clague M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1956-1965Google Scholar). GST Pull-down Assays—GST and various GST fusion proteins were produced in E. coli according to procedures described for the glutathione S-transferase Gene Fusion System (Amersham Biosciences). GST or GST fusion protein was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2–4 h at 4 °C followed by extensive washing in phosphate-buffered saline. An aliquot containing 20 μg of GST or GST fusion protein bound to beads was then incubated with cell lysates prepared as described above for immunoprecipitation analysis. After 4 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. The bound proteins were eluted by incubating the beads in SDS loading buffer containing dithiothreitol at 95 °C for 5 min. Electrophoresis followed by Western blotting were carried out as described previously (3Seet L.-F. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42445-42454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Antibodies specific for TOM1 were produced in rabbits by injecting bacterially produced recombinant TOM1 fragment (amino acids 300–492) coupled to GST as a fusion protein. Antiserum so raised was purified using an affinity matrix prepared by chemically coupling the antigen to glutathione-Sepharose using dimethyl pimelimidate dihydrochlorite (Sigma). Antibody bound to the Sepharose was eluted with ImmunoPure IgG elution buffer (Pierce) and neutralized in 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8. The antibody was then dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7, and concentrated using Centricon (Millipore). Specific blocking of the antibody with its antigen was achieved by incubating the antibody with a 50-fold excess of GST-TOM1(300–492) for at least 4 h at 4 °C. Nonspecific blocking was similarly carried out with either an irrelevant GSTTOM1 fusion (GST-TOM1(2–152)) or GST-TOM1-L1(285–467). The following antibodies were obtained from the indicated commercial sources: polyclonal anti-Myc tag for Western blotting and immunofluorescence studies from Upstate Biotech Inc.; polyclonal anti-Myc tag for immunoprecipitation experiments from Santa Cruz; monoclonal anti-FLAG tag from Roche Applied Science; polyclonal anti-GST from Amersham Biosciences; and monoclonal anti-EEA1 from Transduction Laboratories. The rabbit anti-endofin antibody was obtained as described previously (3Seet L.-F. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42445-42454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Immunofluorescence Analysis by Confocal Microscopy—A431 cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained as described previously (3Seet L.-F. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42445-42454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The cells were viewed and the images taken using a confocal laser scanning microscope (MRC1024; Zeiss). Sucrose Gradients—The procedure was adapted from a previous report (36Stockinger W. Sailler B. Strasser V. Recheis B. Fasching D. Kahr L. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4259-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A431 cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline followed by single wash in cytosol buffer (0.2 m sucrose, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 125 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell monolayers were scraped off into residual cytosol buffer remaining on the dish and disrupted by 40 strokes through a 26-gauge needle. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. The postnuclear supernatant was then loaded on top of a 4-ml column of 10–40% discontinuous sucrose gradient in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.3. The column was spun at 40, 000 rpm for at least 16 h in a Beckmann L7–55 ultracentrifuge using the SW60 Ti swinging bucket rotor. The tube was punctured at the bottom with an 18 gauge needle, and 250-μl fractions were collected into Eppendorf microcentrifuges containing 2× SDS loading buffer. A small aliquot of the postnuclear supernatant as well as a 25-μl aliquot of each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Identification of TOM1 as an Endofin-binding Protein—To isolate proteins that interact with endofin, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using the carboxyl-terminal half of human endofin as bait. Specifically, a GAL4-endofin (806–1539) fusion construct was used to screen a human brain cDNA library (Clontech) (Fig. 1A). 253 positive transformants were sequenced to determine the identity of the clones. Interestingly, three of the transformants contained sequences encoding for human TOM1 (34Cormont M. Mari M. Galmiche A. Hofman P. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1637-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The interaction of endofin with TOM1 was subjected to further study, and the results are presented below. TOM1 was first identified as a member of a superfamily of proteins that features the VHS domain (38Lohi O. Lehto V.-P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition to the amino-terminal VHS domain of about 150 amino acids that includes a single NPF motif, TOM1 contains a central GAT domain that is so named because it has some sequence homology to GGA (GGA and TOM1) (Fig. 1B). To confirm the yeast two-hybrid interaction mentioned above, we cloned the full-length TOM1 sequence from human fetal brain by PCR. Attempts were then made to produce the GST-conjugated form of TOM1 protein in E. coli, but great difficulty was encountered in doing so. As such, we designed constructs that express the individual domains of TOM1 instead. The VHS domain (amino acids 2–152), GAT domain (amino acids 153–299), and the remaining carboxyl-terminal sequence (amino acids 300–492) of TOM1 fused to GST can be successfully expressed in baceria. To establish an interaction between endofin and TOM1 via alternative approaches, we examined the association between endofin and TOM1 in a series of GST pull-down assays. Myc-tagged endofin deleted of the first 814 amino acids (Myc-Endofin(815–1539)), which is similar to the bait used in the yeast two-hybrid screen, was first examined for its ability to bind to the various GST-fused TOM1 domains. Whole cell lysate prepared from 293T cells transfected with the plasmid encoding for Myc-tagged Endofin(815–1539) was incubated with each of the GST-TOM1 domains bound to glutathione resins. Proteins bound to the resin were then resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting and probed with anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 1C (panel ii), Myc-tagged Endofin(815–1539) binds only to the carboxyl terminus of TOM1 but not to GST alone nor to the VHS or GAT domains of TOM1. This result suggests that endofin binds specifically to the carboxyl terminus of TOM1, which has a unique sequence in comparison with other members of the VHS/GGA family. The same experiment was repeated with lysates from 293T cells transfected with either Myc-tagged full-length endofin or endofin deleted of 807 of its carboxyl-terminal amino acids (Myc-Endofin(1–732)). Full-length endofin was found to bind specifically to the carboxyl terminus of TOM1 in a manner similar to that of Myc-Endofin(815–1539) (Fig. 1C, panel i). In contrast, Myc-Endofin(1–732) cannot bind to any domain of TOM1 (Fig. 1C, panel iii). These results indicate that the binding site(s) for TOM1 resides only in the carboxyl-terminal half of endofin and that endofin interacts specifically with the carboxyl-terminal unique region of TOM1. To further define the endofin-binding site on TOM1, we constructed more TOM1 mutants expressing progressively shorter carboxyl-terminal sequences as fusion proteins with GST. In pull-down assays similar to those described above, overexpressed Myc-tagged endofin was able to interact with the TOM1 carboxyl-terminal region from amino acids 322 to 492 but not with the shorter sequence from amino acids 353 to 492 (Fig. 1D). Thus, the binding domain for endofin on TOM1 involves critical residues spanning the region from amino acids 322 to 353. The interaction between endofin and TOM1 in vivo was next examined. Plasmids encoding the various Myc-tagged forms of endofin were designed (Fig. 2A, left panel, and Ref. 3Seet L.-F. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42445-42454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Each of these plasmids was co-transfected with a plasmid encoding FLAG epitope-tagged full-length TOM1 into 293T cells. Whole cell lysates of the transiently transfected cells were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody. When full-length endofin is co-expressed with TOM1, it is able to co-immunoprecipitate with the latter (Fig. 2A, right panel). This property is unaltered even when the FYVE domain was mutated (EndofinC753S). We have shown previously that this mutant is unable to bind phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and does not have an endosomal distribution (3Seet L.-F. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42445-42454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This suggests that the endosomal localization of endofin is not essential for the interaction between endofin and TOM1. In contrast, no co-immunoprecipitation of TOM1 was observed for the two endofin mutants deleted of the carboxyl terminus (Myc-Endofin-(1–962) and Myc-Endofin(1–732)). The failure of these two carboxyl-terminally truncated mutants to bind to TOM1 confirms the above GST pull-down data. On the other hand, the carboxyl-terminal half of endofin, with or without the FYVE domain (Myc-Endofin(732–1539) and Myc-Endofin(815–1539), respectively), can interact with TOM1. Again, the presence or lack of the FYVE domain does not interfere with the ability of the carboxyl-terminal sequence of endofin to interact with TOM1. These data corroborate to indicate that the carboxyl-terminal half of endofin contains a binding site for TOM1 that functions independently of the FYVE domain. To further delineate the TOM1-binding site on endofin, we tested the ability of various endofin carboxyl-terminal deletion constructs to interact with the GST-fused TOM1 carboxyl-terminal fragment (amino acids 300–492) (Fig. 2B, left panel). In pull-down experiments similar to those described previously, it was found that GST-TOM1(300–492) was able to associate with endofin encoding amino acids 1001–1539 but not with the shorter fragment encoding from amino acid residue 1114 (Fig. 2B, right panel). This indicates that the stretch of amino acids from positions 1001 to 1114 contains the residues critical for interaction with TOM1. Surprisingly, these residues, on their own, are insufficient for the interaction because the endofin fragment containing this region but lacking the carboxyl-terminal 20 amino acids (Myc-Endofin(1001–1519)) was unable"

However, the downstream mechanism that is triggered by Myc is unknown. Myc-activation and treatment with the proapoptotic ligands TNFα, FasL, and TRAIL induced H-ferritin expression under serum-deprived conditions. H-ferritin chelates intracellular iron and also intracellular iron sequestration by deferoxamine-induced apoptosis of N.1 cells. Supplementation of serum-free medium with holo-transferrin blocked apoptosis of N.1 cells that was induced by Myc-activation or by treatment with TNFα, FasL, and TRAIL, whereas apotransferrin did not prevent apoptosis. This suggests that intracellular iron depletion was a trigger for apoptosis and that transferrin-bound iron rescued N.1 cells. Furthermore, apoptosis of primary human ovarian carcinoma cells, which was induced by TNFα, FasL, and TRAIL, was also inhibited by holo-transferrin. The data suggest that Myc-activation, FasL, TNFα, and TRAIL disturbed cellular iron homeostasis, which triggered apoptosis of ovarian carcinoma cells and that transferrin iron ensured survival by re-establishing this homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1998068165,"ΔNp73α is an isoform of the p53 homologue p73 that lacks an amino-terminal transactivation domain and antagonizes the induction of gene expression by p53. Here, we examined whether ΔNp73α might also modulate cellular transcription in the absence of p53. The expression of ΔNp73α in the p53−/− cell line H1299 reduced the mRNA levels of p21/CDKN1A, but did not affect other p53-responsive genes. Correspondingly, the p21/CDKN1A promoter was downregulated by ΔNp73α in reporter assays, whereas other p53-responsive promoters were not inhibited. To identify additional genes that respond to ΔNp73α in the absence of p53, microarrays carrying 4600 cDNA clones were hybridized. The expression of 30 genes was found to be altered more than threefold by overexpressed ΔNp73α. For instance, ΔNp73α increased the expression of EGR1 and CDC6, whereas it decreased the mRNA levels of c-MYC, cyclin A2/CCNA2, NF-κB1, ODC1, and RET finger protein/RFP. Semiquantitative reverse transcription–PCR confirmed these results and further revealed that the influence of ΔNp73α on the regulation of these genes differs from other p73 isoforms and p53. We conclude that the impact of ΔNp73α on gene expression is not limited to p53-responsive genes. Rather, ΔNp73α can regulate the expression of a variety of genes independently of p53."
https://openalex.org/W2469814158,"Gamma rays from the γ-ray burst (GRB) 021206 have been reported to be strongly linearly polarized1, with the estimated degree of polarization (80 ± 20%) being close to the absolute maximum of 100% — affording us the opportunity to constrain models of quantum gravity, which has had 1010 years to act on the photons as they travelled towards us. Here I show that if the effects of quantum gravity are linearly proportional to the ratio of the photon energy to the characteristic scale energy of quantum gravity, then the polarization of photons with energies of about 0.1 MeV should be completely random, contrary to what is observed. I conclude that, should the polarization measurement be confirmed, quantum gravity effects act with a power that is greater than linearity, or that loop quantum gravity is not viable. Compared with previous methods and results (see ref. 2, for example), testing of the linear polarization of cosmic γ-ray bursts may substantially extend the observational window on the theory of quantum gravity."
https://openalex.org/W2103843797,"Activated receptor tyrosine kinases bind the Shc adaptor protein through its N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) and C-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. After binding, Shc is phosphorylated within the central collagen-homology (CH) linker region on Tyr-317, a residue remote to both the PTB and SH2 domains. Shc phosphorylation plays a pivotal role in the initiation of mitogenic signaling through the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, but it is unclear if Tyr-317 phosphorylation affects Shc-receptor interactions through the PTB and SH2 domains. To investigate the structural impact of Shc phosphorylation, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out using special-purpose Molecular Dynamics Machine-Grape computers. After a 1-nanosecond equilibration, atomic motions in the structures of unphosphorylated Shc and Shc phosphorylated on Tyr-317 were calculated during a 2-nanosecond period. The results reveal larger phosphotyrosine-binding domain fluctuations and more structural flexibility of unphosphorylated Shc compared with phosphorylated Shc. Collective motions between the PTB-SH2, PTB-CH, and CH-SH2 domains were highly correlated only in unphosphorylated Shc. Dramatic changes in domain coupling and structural rigidity, induced by Tyr-317 phosphorylation, may alter Shc function, bringing about marked differences in the association of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated Shc with its numerous partners, including activated membrane receptors.

Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3557) Google Scholar). After ligand-induced autophosphorylation, RTKs bind and phosphorylate Shc on selected tyrosine residues. The Shc protein consists of an amino-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, a central collagen-homology (CH) region, which contains the major site of tyrosine phosphorylation at Tyr-317 and a carboxyl-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain (2Pelicci G.

Current paradigms for signal transduction emphasize that large adaptor proteins, such as Shc, are organized as “beads on a string.” A single bead is a domain, ranging in size from 50 to 120 amino acids; they are responsible for particular interactions with other proteins or phospholipids (3Pawson T. Nash P. Science. 2003; 300: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). A signaling protein containing several domains can simultaneously associate with two or more binding partners. For example, an adaptor protein can bind to RTKs using an SH2 or PTB domain and associate with a signaling partner by means of another domain. It may appear at first that the modular structure underlying signaling interactions implies that the phosphorylation of residues located outside specialized binding domains should not affect the structural flexibility and intramolecular motions of these domains. Consequently, it should not influence the interactions with partner proteins. For instance, the amino acid sequence of Shc indicates that Tyr-317 is located 110 residues away from the PTB domain and 53 residues away from the SH2 region. Accordingly, binding of Shc to RTKs is thought to be independent of the phosphorylation state of Tyr-317. Another view suggests that, although in a linear sequence of amino acids, phosphorylated tyrosine residues are located at a distance from specialized binding regions, three-dimensional protein structures can fold and move in such a way that negative charges of phosphorylated residues may well influence domain motions and binding interactions. In fact, our kinetic model of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling network predicted that the phosphorylation of Tyr-317 reduces the affinity of Shc for EGFR and facilitates the dissociation of Shc from the receptor (4Kholodenko B.N.

Furthermore, the affinity of the PTB domain-mediated binding of Shc for protein phosphatase 2A was reported to decrease upon phosphorylation of Tyr-317, thus providing another example of the potential influence of the phosphorylation state of distant residues upon binding affinities (6Ugi S.

Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 2375-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The question arises of how the phosphorylation of a single residue on a large adaptor protein can change the dynamics of motion of its domains involved in binding interactions. The present paper addresses this question for the phosphorylation of Tyr-317 on the full-length p52 Shc using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. MD is the most commonly used and convenient method to provide information on protein dynamics (8Young M.A. Gonfloni S. Superti-Furga G. Roux B. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 105: 115-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). It allows for reconstruction of the temporal evolution of a molecular system at high resolution, as it occurs in its natural environment. A special-purpose computer for MD, the Molecular Dynamics Machine (MDM), can calculate large-scale, long-range interactions (van der Waals and Coulomb) with high speed and accuracy (9Narumi T.

The full-length p52 Shc used in this study comprises 458 amino acids, and the system of fully solvated full-length Shc includes over 130,000 atoms. The tremendous computational cost makes it difficult if not impossible to carry out MD simulations using conventional computers. In this paper, we performed a series of MD simulations of the full-length unphosphorylated (Y317-Shc) and phosphorylated Shc (pY317-Shc). To characterize the domain motions and to facilitate comparison between trajectories, we used principal component analysis (PCA) (13Hayward S. Kitao A. Berendsen H.J.C. Proteins. 1997; 27: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 14Hayward S. Proteins. 1999; 36: 425-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 15Kitao A. Go N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) and analyzed the dynamic cross-correlation (DCC) between each domain of Shc. Using the MDM, we found that Tyr-317 phosphorylation significantly affects Shc domain motions and decreases the flexibility of the PTB and SH2 domains, which may reduce the capacity of these domains to interact productively with Shc binding partners. Homology Modeling of the Full-length Shc Structure—The three-dimensional structure of full-length p52 Shc was modeled by using two experimentally determined structures of PTB (16Zhou M.M.

We mapped the target sequence of p52 Shc onto those modeling templates using integrated sequence alignment tools and structural superposition algorithms of the DeepView (Swiss PDB-Viewer) program. Then the initial sequence alignment was optimized manually and submitted to the SWISS-MODEL server for model building (18Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C.

The resulting protein model (residues 17-474) was further improved by performing a 5000-step energy minimization in vacuum. After the initial energy-minimization, each backbone atom of the modeled structure of full-length unphosphorylated Shc was placed at a center of a sphere of transferable intermolecular potential function for 3-point charge model (TIP3P, see Ref. 20Jorgensen W.L.

The size of each sphere was chosen so that the distance of the atoms in the protein from the wall was greater than 15.0 Å. The fully solvated system was energy-minimized using 100 steps of steepest descent followed by 4900 steps of conjugate gradient method.

All non-covalent interactions, van der Waals and Coulomb forces and energies, were calculated by using the MDM. The bond lengths involving hydrogen atoms were constrained to equilibrium length by the SHAKE method (23Ryckeart J.-P. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Comput. Chem. 1977; 23: 327-341Google Scholar). The temperature of the system (unphosphorylated Shc) was gradually heated to 300 K during the first 100-ps period. Then the temperature was kept constant by coupling to a temperature bath at 300 K with a coupling constant of 2 ps (24Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.M.P. van Gunsteren W.F. DiNola A. Haak J.R. J. Comput. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Google Scholar). For equilibrating the system of unphosphorylated Shc, an additional 900-ps MD simulation was performed at 300 K (total of 1-ns MD simulation for the equilibration). Production Runs—We used two structural models as initial structures for production runs: (i) equilibrated unphosphorylated Shc obtained by a 1-ns pre-MD simulation, and (ii) phosphorylated Shc, where Tyr-317 was phosphorylated to yield pY317-Shc, based on the equilibrated structure. Partial phosphotyrosine charges, which are not included in the standard parameter set (22Kollman P.A. Dixon R. Cornell W. Fox T. Chipot C. Pohorille A. Wilkinson P. Weiner P. van Gunsteren W.F. Computer Simulations of Biological Systems. Vol. 3. Elsevier, New York1999: 83-96Google Scholar), were calculated by using RHF/6-31*G single-point calculation with Gaussian 98 (Gaussian, Inc.) and the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) method (25Bayly C.I. Cieplak P. Cornell W.D. Kollman P.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 10269-10280Crossref Scopus (5782) Google Scholar). 2-ns production runs were performed for these two models using the procedures described above (see “Molecular Dynamics” section under “Materials and Methods”). Analyses—After removal of rotational and translational motion, each trajectory was subjected to PCA using a mass-weighted positional covariance matrix, A. All backbone heavy atoms were used in the least square fitting procedure to remove the overall transition and rotations. In Cartesian coordinate space, an element of the mass-weighted positional covariance matrix A, aij, is defined asaij≡〈(xi-〈xi〉)(xj-〈xj〉)〉(Eq. 1) where 〈 〉 is the average over the instantaneous structures sampled during the period of production MD simulation, and x is a mass-weighted atomic coordinate. Diagonalization of A provides the eigen-vectors that describe the dynamics of motions of the structures, and the associated eigenvalues may be interpreted as weights describing the degree to which each mode contributes to the full dynamics. The first two principal modes of each trajectory describing collective motions with the largest amplitudes were extracted to analyze for domain dynamics (these two modes contributed more than 60% to the total mass-weighted mean-square fluctuations of the protein). The dynamic cross-correlation coefficient (Cij) between residues i and j was calculated for the centers of mass of the residues by the following equation (Refs. 26McCammon J.A. Rep. Prog. Phys. 1984; 47: 1-46Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 27Swaminathan S. Harate Jr., W.E. Beveridge D.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 106: 765-784Google Scholar)Cij=〈Δri·Δrj〉/(〈Δri2·Δrj2〉)1/2(Eq. 2) where Δri(j) is displacement of the residue i (j) from its average position and 〈 〉 denotes the time average. The value of Cij can vary from -1, meaning a completely anti-correlated motion, to +1, corresponding to a completely correlated motion. We describe MD simulations of domain motions in full-length unphosphorylated and phosphorylated Shc on a nanosecond (ns) time scale. After phosphorylation of Shc on Tyr-317, the flexibility of the protein to undergo conformation transitions may change because of the effect of the negative charge of the pY317. However, in this study, the simulated time scales are too short to observe such conformational changes. Therefore, we compared domain dynamics obtained by MD simulations to identify how Shc structural domain motions are influenced by the phosphorylation of Tyr-317. Overall Structure—To test the stability and equilibrate the initial Shc structure obtained by homology modeling, we carried out a 1-ns MD simulation. As a result, the initial conformation was improved, yielding a root-mean-square (RMS) deviation from the initial model of 5 Å. Most of this adjustment occurred in the early phase of the equilibration, and after 0.5 ns, there was very little additional drift in the structure, with the remaining change in the RMS deviation of ± 0.5 Å. The modeled and equilibrated Shc structures are shown in Fig. 1. Almost all large structural changes were observed in loop regions, and the relative abundance of various secondary structure types remained unchanged during the 1-ns MD simulation. These simulations indicate that the full-length Shc structure obtained by homology modeling was satisfactory, and the extent of the equilibration of the initial structure was sufficient. After carrying out MD simulations for the Shc structure equilibration, we performed production MD simulations of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated Shc for 2.0 ns. Fig. 2A shows the time courses of the RMS deviations of backbone heavy atoms during the production runs. Both the Y317-Shc and pY317-Shc structures were stable during the 1.3 to 2.0-ns period. Unexpectedly, the RMS deviation for unphosphorylated Shc gradually increased in the first 1.0-ns period. During 2.0-ns production runs, several regions with large positional displacement were observed (Fig. 2B). All of these regions were loop regions. The positional displacement of residues 45-71, 137-151, and 166-188 in the PTB domain, residues 256-264 and 273-279 in the CH domain, and residues 403-430 in the SH2 domain showed marked differences between unphosphorylated Shc and pY317-Shc (Figs. 2B and 3). Importantly, in the PTB domain, the residues Arg-67, Ser-151, Lys-169, and Arg-175, and in the SH2 domain Arg-386, Arg-401, Val-411, and His-422 (all of which showed large displacement changes) have been reported to be binding sites for phosphotyrosyl peptides (Fig. 3; Refs. 16Zhou M.M.

Thus, our results demonstrate marked alterations in the movements of these binding regions, induced by Tyr-317 phosphorylation. These differences are likely to play a significant role in interactions of various proteins with Shc, resulting in changes in the expected binding affinities. Not surprisingly, the 2-ns simulation period seems to be too short to see phosphorylation-induced changes in the overall Shc structures. As shown in Fig. 4, no large structural difference is observed between the averaged unphosphorylated and pY317-Shc structures over 2-ns trajectories.Fig. 3The three-dimensional structure of the full-length Shc obtained by homology modeling (A) and experimentally obtained structures of the PTB (B) and SH2 (C) domains (16Zhou M.M.

The RMS fluctuations of unphosphorylated and pY317-Shc residues averaged over the simulated trajectories are shown in Fig. 5. Almost all peaks corresponded to loop regions. The calculated RMS fluctuations showed higher magnitudes in the unphosphorylated Shc structures, especially in the PTB domain. These results suggest that the PTB domain is flexible in unphosphorylated Shc but is a relatively rigid structure in pY317-Shc. The smaller flexibility of pY317-Shc may reflect the predicted reduction in the binding affinity for EGFR, resulting in the dissociation from the receptor after Shc tyrosine phosphorylation (4Kholodenko B.N.

Hoek J.B. Kholodenko B.N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 306-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Large fluctuations of residues 310-330, including Tyr-317, are observed in unphosphorylated Shc, whereas fluctuations of these residues are significantly smaller in pY317-Shc (Fig. 5). After the phosphorylation of Tyr-317, Shc is activated to bind to Grb2 through pY317. Given that the binding region (residues 310-330 on Shc) is exposed to the solvent, large fluctuations are reasonable in unphosphorylated Shc and are expected to prevent the binding of Grb2 to this region. The RMS fluctuations of residues 361-383 in unphosphorylated Shc and pY317-Shc also display a marked difference (Fig. 5). These residues seem to be close to the SH2 domain binding site for a phosphotyrosyl peptide (17Zhou M.M. Meadows R.P. Logan T.M. Yoon H.S. Wade W.S. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7784-7788Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and, hence, their dynamics can potentially influence binding interactions. How is the fluctuation of pY317-Shc reduced? To answer this question and assess Shc domain motions, we performed PCA to analyze each MD trajectory (see “Materials and Methods”). Fig. 6 shows the MD trajectories projected onto the plane defined by the first two principal components. For unphosphorylated Shc, two structural clusters are clearly visible, indicating that conformations can jump over the lower energy barrier of the conformational energy surface. By contrast, for pY317-Shc, such jumps were not observed, indicating that the free energy barriers became higher as a result of phosphorylation at Tyr-317. Combining this fact with the data on the RMS fluctuation, we conclude that the pY317-Shc structure shows less flexibility and higher rigidity than the structure of unphosphorylated Shc. The dynamic properties of the first principal mode, calculated using PCA (Fig. 7A), demonstrated that each domain motion of unphosphorylated Shc was correlated. However, for pY317-Shc, the motion of the CH domain independently contributed to fluctuations of the whole protein, and the PTB and SH2 domains showed smaller amplitudes of dynamic motions in the first principal mode.Fig. 7A, dynamic properties of the first principal mode calculated from PCA.

Proteins. 1999; 36: 425-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 28Hayward S. Berendsen H.J.C. Proteins. 1998; 30: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). The initial (first equilibrated) and averaged (during the production runs) structures were used as input for the DynDom program. In the case of unphosphorylated Shc, the PTB domain was recognized as a dynamic domain, and bending residues (residues 215-216) were found in the CH domain (Fig. 7B). On the contrary, for pY317-Shc, the PTB, CH, and SH2 domains were not detected as dynamic domains, and the long loop region in the PTB domain moved as a dynamic domain (Fig. 7B). These findings indicate that domain motions are reduced by the phosphorylation of Tyr-317, which is consistent with the results of the first principal mode analysis (Fig. 7A). The reduction of domain motions revealed by simulations may be essential for the overall effect of phosphorylation of Tyr-317. A DCC map illustrates domain communications in the protein dynamics (26McCammon J.A. Rep. Prog. Phys. 1984; 47: 1-46Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 27Swaminathan S. Harate Jr., W.E. Beveridge D.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 106: 765-784Google Scholar). The DCC maps of Fig. 8 show cross-correlations between each domain in the Shc protein (PTB, CH, and SH2). On the whole, all interdomain motions were highly correlated in unphosphorylated Shc (Fig. 8, left column), but those correlations were reduced in pY317-Shc (Fig. 8, right column). Notably, the considerable differences of the domain motions (communications) are caused by the effect of the phosphorylation at a single residue (Tyr-317). Interestingly, in unphosphorylated Shc, the region around Tyr-317 (residues 310-330) in the CH domain positively correlated with hinge residues (215-216) and SH2 domain residues (middle and bottom of left column in Fig. 8, respectively). These positive dynamic correlations were weak for pY317-Shc, as compared with unphosphorylated Shc (middle and bottom of right column in Fig. 8). From the analyses of the domain motion and DCC maps, it is suggested that reduction of the dynamic correlation between residues 310-330 and SH2 domain/hinge residues reflects uncoupling of motions between each of the domains after phosphorylation of pY317, and fluctuations of individual domains are also reduced. The adapter protein Shc is a critical mediator of signals derived from RTKs. Through its PTB and SH2 domains, cytoplasmic Shc binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on a variety of activated RTKs. Subsequently, Shc is phosphorylated by RTKs on tyrosine residues 239, 240, and 317 in the CH region. Tyr-317 forms a major binding site for Grb2, whereas the two other tyrosine residues are dispensable, as shown by mutation studies (29Salcini A.E. McGlade J. Pelicci G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2827-2836PubMed Google Scholar, 30Pelicci G. Giordano S. Zhen Z. Salcini A.E. Lanfrancone L. Bardeli A. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Ponzetto C. Pelicci P.G.

Binding of Grb2 is followed by the recruitment of cytoplasmic SOS (a homolog of the Drosophila melanogaster Son of sevenless) into the RTK-Shc-Grb2 complex (or the cytoplasmic Grb2-SOS complex can bind to the RTK-Shc complex) (1Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3557) Google Scholar, 32Sastry L. Lin W. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Scoppa C.A. King C.R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30472-30478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS catalyzes the conversion of Ras from its inactive Ras-GDP form to the active Ras-GTP form, which activates the signaling through the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. Numerous studies have shown that the spatial localization of SOS (in this case as a component of the Shc-Grb2-SOS complex) in the cell is crucial for the effective activation of the membrane-anchored Ras (Ref. 34Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar; for a review, see Ref. 35Kholodenko B.N. Hoek J.B. Westerhoff H.V. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 173-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The pY317-Shc-Grb2-SOS complex can be either associated with RTK in close vicinity to the plasma membrane or distributed through the cell cytoplasm after pY317-Shc dissociates from RTKs. In a linear sequence of Shc residues, Tyr-317 is remote from the PTB and SH2 domains that flank the CH region from two different sides. Even in the folded protein, pY317 is at a considerable distance from the binding regions in the PTB and SH2 domains (Fig. 1). Therefore, it is not clear whether or how the phosphorylation of Tyr-317 affects the association of Shc with RTKs and other proteins through the PTB and SH2 domains of Shc. To investigate the impact of Tyr-317 phosphorylation on structural factors that would influence the binding capacity of Shc, MD simulations of the unphosphorylated and pY317-Shc structures were carried out. The simulated systems of fully solvated unphosphorylated and pY317-Shc molecules included over 130,000 atoms. The MDM, a special-purpose computer for MD, was well suited to perform these large-scale simulations, as it could accurately calculate large numbers of non-covalent interactions at high speed. Thus, the MDM is expected to become the tool of choice for large-scale MD simulations of biomolecules. Our simulations reveal significantly larger fluctuations of PTB domain residues of unphosphorylated Shc, implying a higher flexibility of that domain in Y317-Shc than in pY317-Shc. This domain flexibility is an important prerequisite for the induction of a proper fit to a binding partner, such as the activated receptor. Interestingly, the positional displacement of several regions comprising the binding sites for phosphotyrosyl peptides showed marked differences between Y317-Shc and pY317-Shc (Figs. 2B and 3). Collective motions between the PTB-SH2, PTB-CH, and CH-SH2 domains of unphosphorylated Shc were highly correlated, whereas no significant correlation was observed for pY317-Shc (Fig. 8). The results indicate that the domain motions of unphosphorylated Shc are tightly coupled by the interdomain interactions; the phosphorylation of Tyr-317 clamps interdomain interactions, so that domain coupling is reduced. Because in the folded protein, the distance between pY317 and the PTB and SH2 residues, which are responsible for the binding of phosphotyrosyl peptides on RTKs, is greater than 35 Å (PTB domain) and 11 Å (SH2 domain), respectively, the effect of Tyr-317 phosphorylation is not a result of a direct interaction of pY317 with the binding regions but rather is a consequence of the changes in the flexibility of the CH linker region. Hence, flexibility in the CH domain is required to maintain protein domain coupling and motility. These findings are in agreement with an earlier suggestion that the CH domain may play an unexplained role in regulating the binding by means of the PTB or SH2 domain, based on the observation that the PTB+CH and CH+SH2 domain fusion proteins appear to bind better to their respective targets than the PTB and SH2 domains by themselves (36Ravichandran K.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6322-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In summary, the data presented here, including the observed RMS fluctuations and the RMS deviations between the time-averaged and equilibrated structures, demonstrate that pY317-Shc is structurally more rigid than unphosphorylated Shc. Dramatic changes in collective domain motions, reflecting the induced rigidity of the CH linker region and the sites through which Shc binds to activated receptors, suggest that the phosphorylation of Tyr-317 can lead to marked changes in the binding affinities. As a result, tyrosine phosphorylation may promote the detachment of phosphorylated Shc from the receptor. In fact, increased dissociation of the EGFR-Shc complex after Tyr-317 phosphorylation was proposed in recent kinetic modeling studies (see figure 5 in Ref. 4Kholodenko B.N. Demin O.V. Moehren G.

This will facilitate the redistribution of the pY317-Shc-Grb2-SOS complexes to other cellular membranes where Ras has been reported to reside (37Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R.

https://openalex.org/W2003718158,"Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMSs) are one of the most common solid tumor of childhood. Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cells fail to both complete the skeletal muscle differentiation program and irreversibly exit the cell cycle as a consequence of an active repression exerted on the muscle-promoting factor MyoD. Myostatin is a negative regulator of normal muscle growth, we have thus studied its possible role in RMS cells. Here, we present evidence that overexpression of myostatin is a common feature of RMS since both subtypes of RMS (embryonal RD and alveolar Rh30 cells) express high levels of myostatin when compared to nontumoral skeletal muscle cells. Interestingly, we found that inactivation of myostatin through overexpression of antisense myostatin or of follistatin (a myostatin antagonist) constructs enhanced differentiation of RD cells. In addition, RD and Rh30 cells treated with blocking antimyostatin antibodies progress into the myogenic terminal differentiation program. Finally, our results suggest that high levels of myostatin could impair MyoD function in RMS cells. These results show that an autocrine myostatin loop contributes to maintain RMS cells in an undifferentiating stage and suggest that new therapeutic approaches could be exploited for the treatment of RMS based on inactivation of myostatin protein."
https://openalex.org/W2051687972,"The tumor suppressor p53-related p73 shares significant amino-acid sequence identity with p53. Like p53, p73 recognizes canonical p53 DNA-binding sites and activates p53-responsive target genes and induces apoptosis. Moreover, transcription coactivator p300/CBP binds to and coactivates with both p53 and p73 in stimulating the expression of their target genes. Here, we report that coactivator PCAF binds to p73. The N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) and the conserved oligomerization domain (OD) of p73 are both required for its interaction with PCAF. Conversely, PCAF's HAT-domain is required for and both the N-terminal region and Bromo domain enhance binding of PCAF to p73. Significantly, PCAF stimulates p73-mediated transactivation, and binding of PCAF to p73 is necessary for p73's transactivation activity. PCAF-specific siRNA dramatically reduces p73-mediated transactivation. Stimulation of p73-mediated transactivation by PCAF requires the HAT domain of PCAF and the p53-binding site within the p21 promoter. In vivo, coexpression of wild-type, but not HAT-deficient PCAF with p73beta markedly increases p21 expression. Furthermore, cotransfection of PCAF and p73 leads to increased apoptosis and reduced colony formation. Collectively, these data suggest that p73 recruit PCAF to specific promoters to activate the transcription of p73 target genes."

The oxidation of cysteine thiols requires a continuous flux of electrons toward the final electron acceptor(s). This flux is mediated by an electron transfer chain, which is composed of proteins and redox compounds of small molecular weight (1Bardwell J.C. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 758-760Google Scholar, 2Tu B.P.

Biophys. 2001; 388: 55-59Google Scholar), glutathione disulfide (8Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Google Scholar), and dehydroascorbate (9Csala M. Braun L. Mile V. Kardon T. Szarka A. Kupcsulik P. Mandl J. Bánhegyi G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 539-543Google Scholar). Recent findings with yeast suggest that FAD has a crucial role in the process.

Robertus J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 121-126Google Scholar)) are proposed to be components of the oxidative folding machinery. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the activity of Ero1p is dependent on the presence of free FAD, and free cytosolic FAD is able to cross the yeast ER membrane (18Tu B.P. Weissman J.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 983-994Google Scholar).The mechanism of oxidative folding is less explored in mammalian cells. The mammalian analogues of Ero1p, Ero1-Ls, have been described in the human ER (19Cabibbo A. Pagani M. Fabbri M. Rocchi M. Farmery M.R. Bulleid N.J. Sitia R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4827-4833Google Scholar, 20Pagani M. Fabbri M. Benedetti C. Fassio A. Pilati S. Bulleid N.J. Cabibbo A. Sitia R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23685-23692Google Scholar), and their role in the electron transfer has been proved (21Benham A.M. Cabibbo A. Fassio A. Bulleid N. Sitia R. Braakman I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4493-4502Google Scholar, 22Mezghrani A. Fassio A. Benham A. Simmen T. Braakman I. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6288-6296Google Scholar). However, the further route of the electrons from Ero1-L is unknown. Based on the observations in yeast, it can be supposed that free FAD plays an indispensable role in the promotion of oxidative folding also in mammalian cells. Indeed, riboflavin deficiency causes intracellular accumulation of interleukin-2 with increased expression of genes of unfolded protein response in Jurkat cells (23Camporeale G. Zempleni J. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 668-672Google Scholar). However, neither the transport of FAD through the ER membrane nor its oxidative effect on microsomal protein thiols has been described in mammalian cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate these processes in rat liver microsomal vesicles. The results demonstrate that FAD transport and subsequent disulfide bond formation are present in the hepatic ER.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Rat Liver Microsomes—Liver microsomes were prepared from fed male Sprague-Dawley rats (180–230 g of body weight; Charles River Hungary) as reported earlier (24Henne V. Söling H.D. FEBS Lett. 1986; 202: 267-273Google Scholar). Microsomal fractions were resuspended in buffer A containing: 100 mm KCl; 20 mm NaCl; 1 mm MgCl2; 20 mm Mops; pH 7.2. The suspensions were rapidly frozen and maintained under liquid N2 until used. Intactness of microsomal vesicles was controlled by measuring the latency of mannose-6-phosphatase activity (25Burchell A. Hume R. Burchell B. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1988; 173: 183-191Google Scholar). The intactness/latency was greater than 90% in all microsomal preparations employed. Protein concentration of microsomes was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay solution with bovine serum albumin as a standard according to the manufacturer's instructions.Measurement of Intravesicular FAD Space—Liver microsomes (10 mg of protein/ml) were resuspended in buffer A. The microsomal suspension was incubated in the presence of 1 mm FAD or [3H]water (0.2 μCi/ml) or [3H]inulin (0.17 μCi/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. To measure isotope spaces, microsomes were centrifuged (100,000 × g, 1 h), and the radioactivity associated with the pellets was measured to enable calculation of extra- and intravesicular isotope spaces. To measure the intravesicular FAD spaces, the 100,000 × g pellet was resuspended, and its FAD content was measured fluorimetrically by a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian) at 450-nm excitation and 530-nm emission wavelengths. Background microsomal fluorescence was measured in all experiments, and all data were corrected to this value. Parallel samples were incubated in the presence of FAD plus the pore-forming compound alamethicin (0.05 mg/mg of protein; Ref. 26Fulceri R. Bánhegyi G. Gamberucci A. Giunti R. Mandl J. Benedetti A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 43-46Google Scholar). Alamethicin was also added to some pellets containing FAD, and then they were resuspended and centrifuged again (100,000 × g, 1 h).Rapid Filtration Experiments—For the measurement of glucose-6-phosphate uptake and accumulation, liver microsomes (2 mg of protein/ml) were incubated in buffer A containing 10 μm glucose-6-phosphate plus [14C]glucose-6-phosphate (8–10 mCi/ml) at 22 °C. In a series of incubations, the pore-forming antibiotic alamethicin (0.1 mg/ml) was added to distinguish the intravesicular and the bound radioactivity (27Bánhegyi G. Marcolongo P. Fulceri R. Hinds C. Burchell A. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13584-13590Google Scholar, 28Puskás F. Marcolongo P. Watkins S.L. Mandl J. Allan B.B. Houston P. Burchell A. Benedetti A. Bánhegyi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 117-122Google Scholar). The alamethicin-releasable portion of radioactivity was regarded as intravesicular. At the indicated time intervals, samples (0.1 ml) were rapidly filtered through cellulose acetate/nitrate filter membranes (pore size, 0.22 μm) and were washed with ice-cold buffer A containing 1 mm DIDS. The radioactivity associated with microsomes retained by filters was measured by liquid scintillation counting.For the measurement of FAD uptake and accumulation, the experimental conditions were the same except that the concentration of microsomal proteins was 1 mg/ml. Vesicles retained by the filters were solubilized with 2% Triton X-100, and FAD was measured fluorimetrically (see above). Candidate inhibitors of the transport were added 5 min before FAD. FAD efflux was measured after the loading of vesicles (10 mg of protein/ml) by incubating them in the presence of 1 mm FAD for 30 min at room temperature. Efflux was initiated by the 10-fold dilution of the medium with FAD-free buffer A.Measurement of Microsomal Protein Thiol Oxidation—Microsomes (2.5 mg/ml), diluted in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2), were incubated in the presence or absence of free FAD at 37 °C. After 20 min of incubation under atmospheric conditions, the protein fraction was precipitated by 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed three times by 70% acetone, and resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 8 m urea, and 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (pH 7.0). Thiol content of the resuspended protein fraction was measured by the Ellman method using a Hitachi U-1500 spectrophotometer.Materials—Alamethicin, glucose-6-phosphate (dipotassium salt), FAD, DIDS, flufenamic acid were from Sigma. [3H]Water (1 mCi/g) and [3H]inulin (500 mCi/g) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. d-[14C-(U)]Glucose-6-phosphate (0.1 mCi/ml; 300 mCi/mmol) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Cellulose acetate/nitrate filter membranes (pore size, 0.22 μm) were from Millipore. All other chemicals were of analytical grade.RESULTSIntravesicular FAD-accessible Space in Rat Liver Microsomal Vesicles—In a first set of experiments, the permeability of FAD through the microsomal membrane was investigated by measuring the FAD-accessible intravesicular space of the vesicles. The intra- and extravesicular apparent spaces of vesicles were detected by using [3H]water as fully membrane-permeant and [3H]inulin as non-permeant compounds, respectively.FAD occupied a greater intravesicular space than water (Table I), indicating that this compound easily permeates the microsomal membrane. The accumulation was due to a real uptake since in the presence of the pore-forming compound alamethicin, the intravesicular FAD accumulation could not be observed, and FAD binding to proteins and membranes was responsible for less than 15% of the total association (data not shown). Therefore, FAD accumulation might be caused by its uptake and possible intravesicular metabolism.Table IIntravesicular apparent space of FAD in rat liver microsomesApparent spaceTotalIntravesicularμl/mg of protein[3H]Inulin9.41[3H]Water13.774.36FAD15.866.43 Open table in a new tab FAD Transport in Rat Liver Microsomal Vesicles—The above experiments already indicated the transport of FAD into/from microsomal vesicles. FAD uptake could be directly monitored by the conventional rapid filtration-based transport assay. After a fast initial phase, FAD uptake reached a maximum value at around 10 min and occupied ∼5 μl/mg of protein intravesicular space (Fig. 1A). The majority of microsome-associated FAD could be released by the pore-forming agent alamethicin, indicating that FAD was present intravesicularly. The transport was bidirectional; a fast efflux was observed from FAD-loaded vesicles upon dilution (Fig. 1B).We have tested the effect of some commonly used anion transport inhibitors and also the mitochondrial FAD transport inhibitor atractyloside (29Barile M. Brizio C. Valenti D. De Virgilio C. Passarella S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4888-4900Google Scholar) on microsomal FAD uptake. Preincubation of microsomes in the presence of DIDS and atractyloside inhibited the uptake of FAD, whereas N-ethylmaleimide was poorly effective, and flufenamic acid was ineffective (Figs. 1 and 2). The inhibitory effect of DIDS and atractyloside was concentration-dependent (Fig. 3). The FAD efflux was also inhibitable by DIDS (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the compound was consistently used to block the efflux during the washing procedure of rapid filtration. As can be seen in Fig. 1A, the absence of DIDS in the washing buffer resulted in a systematic underestimation of FAD uptake due to its efflux during sample processing.Fig. 2Effect of putative inhibitors on FAD uptake in rat liver microsomes. Microsomes (1 mg of protein/ml) were incubated in buffer A in the presence of the indicated compounds for 5 min at room temperature. After the addition of 1 mm FAD, the vesicles were incubated for a further 5 min, and then FAD uptake was detected by the rapid filtration method as described in the legend for Fig. 1. 1 mm DIDS was used.

After the addition of 1 mm FAD, the vesicles were incubated for a further 5 min, and then FAD uptake was detected by the rapid filtration method as described in the legend for Fig. 1. Data are means ± S.D., n = 6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Free FAD Supports Intraluminal Oxidative Processes in Rat Liver Microsomal Vesicles—If FAD is transported across the microsomal membrane, it should promote intraluminal oxidative processes. To prove this assumption, two intraluminal oxidative processes, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenation and protein thiol oxidation, were investigated. It has been reported that the intravesicular oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate by hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme present in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (30Hori S.H. Takahashi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 496: 1-11Google Scholar), can be stimulated by allowing the reoxidation of intraluminal NAD(P)H to NAD(P)+. Metyrapone, a membrane-permeant substrate for a reductase present in the endoplasmic reticulum (31Maser E. Netter K.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 3049-3054Google Scholar), was used to convert back NAD(P)H (32Gerin I. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 3257-3260Google Scholar). This compound caused a dose-dependent increase in the accumulation of radioactivity in microsomes incubated with [14C]glucose-6-phosphate. The accumulated compound was 6-phosphogluconate, the product of hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (32Gerin I. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 3257-3260Google Scholar). On this basis, we supposed that other NAD(P)H oxidizing agents, including FAD, are also able to increase in the accumulation of radioactivity in microsomes incubated with [14C]glucose-6-phosphate. In fact, microsomes preincubated in the presence of 1 mm FAD showed a 1.6 times higher accumulation of radioactivity at the steady-state phase upon [14C]glucose-6-phosphate addition (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Effect of FAD on intravesicular glucose-6-phosphate oxidation in rat liver microsomes. Glucose-6-phosphate oxidation was estimated on the basis of the intraluminal accumulation of radioactivity upon [14C]glucose-6-phosphate addition. Microsomes (2 mg of protein/ml) were preincubated in the presence (•) or in the absence (○) of 1 mm FAD for 5 min at room temperature. Intravesicular accumulation of radioactivity upon [14C]glucose-6-phosphate (10 μm) addition was measured by rapid filtration. At 10 min, the pore-forming compound alamethicin (0.1 mg/ml; arrow) was added to the incubates. Data are means ± S.D., n = 4–6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In another set of experiments, the effect of FAD was examined on disulfide bond formation in microsomal vesicles. The concentration of protein thiols in rat liver microsomes incubated at 37 °C under atmospheric conditions did not change significantly with time. Addition of FAD resulted in a marked consumption of protein thiols. Maximal effect was reached at 0.2 mm FAD concentration, which caused the oxidation of about one-third of the total amount of microsomal thiol groups (Fig. 5). The effect was concentration-dependent, and 10 μm FAD already was effective, but FAD concentrations higher than 200 μm or incubations longer than 20 min did not result in a further significant increase in thiol oxidation. Inhibition of FAD uptake by atractyloside prevented the oxidative effect of FAD on microsomal protein thiols (Table II). Atractyloside in itself did not influence the redox state of microsomal protein thiols in the applied concentration.Fig. 5Effect of FAD on protein thiol oxidation in rat liver microsomes. Microsomes (2.5 mg of protein/ml) were incubated in the presence of various concentrations of FAD for 20 min at 37 °C. Protein thiol contents were measured at the end of the incubations.

Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONDisulfide bond formation in secretory proteins requires an electron transfer chain from protein thiols to molecular oxygen in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cells. The current model of the system, established in yeast, describes an essential protein relay involving protein disulfide isomerase and the flavoprotein Ero1p. The latter protein, in addition to having a tightly bound FAD moiety, can bind free FAD; this binding is essential for its function. FAD is synthesized in the cytosol but can readily enter the ER lumen and promote Ero1p-catalyzed oxidation (2Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Google Scholar, 18Tu B.P. Weissman J.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 983-994Google Scholar).Since mammalian cells are known to possess Ero1p analogues (19Cabibbo A. Pagani M. Fabbri M. Rocchi M. Farmery M.R. Bulleid N.J. Sitia R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4827-4833Google Scholar, 20Pagani M. Fabbri M. Benedetti C. Fassio A. Pilati S. Bulleid N.J. Cabibbo A. Sitia R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23685-23692Google Scholar, 21Benham A.M. Cabibbo A. Fassio A. Bulleid N. Sitia R. Braakman I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4493-4502Google Scholar, 22Mezghrani A. Fassio A. Benham A. Simmen T. Braakman I. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6288-6296Google Scholar), it can be proposed that FAD transport across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane has a crucial role in the oxidative protein folding of these cells. In accordance with this proposal, we have found that FAD can easily reach the intraluminal space of rat liver microsomal vesicles (Table I). As demonstrated in rapid filtration experiments, the transport of FAD is bidirectional (Fig. 1). The calculated intravesicular FAD concentration surpasses the extravesicular concentration in the steady-state phase of the uptake (Fig. 1). The phenomenon can be caused by an intravesicular metabolism, which is further supported by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of the samples. 2A. Szarka, unpublished observation. The transport could be inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by the anion transport blocker DIDS and by atractyloside (Figs. 1, 2, 3), which also inhibits mitochondrial FAD transport (29Barile M. Brizio C. Valenti D. De Virgilio C. Passarella S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4888-4900Google Scholar). Taken together, our observations support the existence of a protein-mediated FAD transport in the hepatic endoplasmic reticulum.The presence of FAD in the microsomal lumen has also been shown indirectly. FAD added to the microsomal vesicles promoted the intraluminal oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate (Fig. 4) and protein thiols (Fig. 5). A direct link between FAD transport and FAD-dependent protein thiol oxidation was also demonstrated; the inhibition of the uptake by atractyloside prevented the oxidation of protein thiols (Table II). Similarly, our observations reporting a larger intravesicular FAD space than that of water suggest the utilization of FAD in the ER lumen, beyond a simple turnover of the compound by repeated uptake and efflux steps.FAD transport through the endomembranes is a poorly characterized process; neither of the responsible transporters is known at the molecular level. FAD transport has only been detected in the inner mitochondral membrane so far (29Barile M. Brizio C. Valenti D. De Virgilio C. Passarella S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4888-4900Google Scholar). That mitochondrial transporter is probably an antiporter, which can be inhibited by atractyloside at low micromolar concentration (29Barile M. Brizio C. Valenti D. De Virgilio C. Passarella S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4888-4900Google Scholar). The features of FAD transport reported here (inhibition by DIDS, relative insensitivity toward atractyloside, slight inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide) are similar to that of the ATP/ADP antiporter of the endoplasmic reticulum (33Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Google Scholar, 34Clairmont C.A. De Maio A. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3983-3990Google Scholar). The possibility is raised that FAD transport is a function of ATP/ADP antiporters in both the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum.In conclusion, the present findings show that cytosolic free FAD may promote disulfide bond formation in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum of mammalian cells. FAD transport through the endoplasmic reticulum membrane can be an important factor to link disulfide formation to the nutritional, metabolic, and energetic status of the cell. Secreted proteins contain a significant amount of disulfide bonds, which are required for their proper folding, stability, and functioning. Disulfide formation occurs in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid. of eukaryotic cells. The oxidation of cysteine thiols requires a continuous flux of electrons toward the final electron acceptor(s). This flux is mediated by an electron transfer chain, which is composed of proteins and redox compounds of small molecular weight (1Bardwell J.C. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 758-760Google Scholar, 2Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Google Scholar, 3Frand A.R. Cuozzo J.W. Kaiser C.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 203-210Google Scholar, 4Debarbieux L.

Although key proteins of the machinery have already been identified, the chemical nature of small molecules as possible cofactors is still disputed. Several redox-active compounds have been postulated as participants in the electron transfer chain, e.g. vitamin K (6Soute B.A. Groenen-van Dooren M.M. Holmgren A. Lundstrom J. Vermeer C. Biochem.

Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the activity of Ero1p is dependent on the presence of free FAD, and free cytosolic FAD is able to cross the yeast ER membrane (18Tu B.P. Weissman J.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 983-994Google Scholar). The mechanism of oxidative folding is less explored in mammalian cells. The mammalian analogues of Ero1p, Ero1-Ls, have been described in the human ER (19Cabibbo A. Pagani M. Fabbri M. Rocchi M. Farmery M.R. Bulleid N.J. Sitia R. J. Biol.

However, the further route of the electrons from Ero1-L is unknown. Based on the observations in yeast, it can be supposed that free FAD plays an indispensable role in the promotion of oxidative folding also in mammalian cells. Indeed, riboflavin deficiency causes intracellular accumulation of interleukin-2 with increased expression of genes of unfolded protein response in Jurkat cells (23Camporeale G. Zempleni J. J.

The aim of the present study was to investigate these processes in rat liver microsomal vesicles. The results demonstrate that FAD transport and subsequent disulfide bond formation are present in the hepatic ER. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Rat Liver Microsomes—Liver microsomes were prepared from fed male Sprague-Dawley rats (180–230 g of body weight; Charles River Hungary) as reported earlier (24Henne V. Söling H.D. FEBS Lett. 1986; 202: 267-273Google Scholar). Microsomal fractions were resuspended in buffer A containing: 100 mm KCl; 20 mm NaCl; 1 mm MgCl2; 20 mm Mops; pH 7.2. The suspensions were rapidly frozen and maintained under liquid N2 until used. Intactness of microsomal vesicles was controlled by measuring the latency of mannose-6-phosphatase activity (25Burchell A. Hume R. Burchell B. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1988; 173: 183-191Google Scholar). The intactness/latency was greater than 90% in all microsomal preparations employed. Protein concentration of microsomes was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay solution with bovine serum albumin as a standard according to the manufacturer's instructions.Measurement of Intravesicular FAD Space—Liver microsomes (10 mg of protein/ml) were resuspended in buffer A. The microsomal suspension was incubated in the presence of 1 mm FAD or [3H]water (0.2 μCi/ml) or [3H]inulin (0.17 μCi/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. To measure isotope spaces, microsomes were centrifuged (100,000 × g, 1 h), and the radioactivity associated with the pellets was measured to enable calculatio"

A reductase (MMOR), which contains [2Fe-2S] and FAD cofactors, facilitates electron transfer from NADH to the hydroxylase diiron active sites where dioxygen activation and substrate hydroxylation take place. By separately expressing the ferredoxin (MMORFd, MMOR residues 1-98) and FAD/NADH (MMOR-FAD, MMOR residues 99-348) domains of the reductase, nearly all biochemical properties of full-length MMOR are retained, except for interdomain electron transfer rates. To investigate the extent to which rapid electron transfer between domains might be restored and further to explore the modularity of MMOR, MMOR-Fd and MMOR-FAD were connected in a non-native fashion. Four different linker sequences were employed to create MMOR reversed-domain (MMOR-RD) constructs, MMOR(99-342)-linker-MMOR(2-98), with a domain connectivity observed in other homologous oxidoreductases. The optical, redox, and electron transfer properties of the four MMOR-RD proteins were characterized and compared with those of wild-type MMOR. The linker sequence plays a key role in controlling solvent accessibility to the FAD cofactor, as evidenced by perturbed flavin optical spectra, decreased FADox/FADsq redox potentials, and increased steady-state oxidase activities in three of the constructs. Stopped-flow optical spectroscopy revealed slow interdomain electron transfer (k < 0.04 s-1 at 4 °C, compared with 90 s-1 for wild-type MMOR) for all three MMOR-RD proteins with 7-residue linkers. A long (14-residue), flexible linker afforded much faster electron transfer between the FAD and [2Fe-2S] cofactors (k = 0.9 s-1 at 4 °C).

Both systems require three components: a dimeric (αβγ)2 hydroxylase (MMOH, 251 kDa) with dinuclear, carboxylate-bridged iron centers, where dioxygen activation and methane hydroxylation occur; a regulatory protein (MMOB, 15.9 kDa); and a reductase (MMOR, 38.5 kDa) that transfers electrons from NADH to the MMOH diiron sites, thereby priming the hydroxylase for reaction with dioxygen. The N-terminal domain of MMOR, which houses a [2Fe-2S] cluster, shares sequence (20Stainthorpe A.C. Lees V. Salmond G.P.C. Dalton H. Murrell J.C.

A flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor located in the C-terminal portion of MMOR accepts two electrons from NADH. These electrons are passed sequentially from the reduced FAD moiety through the MMOR [2Fe-2S] center into the hydroxylase active sites by means of a series of intra- and intermolecular electron transfer reactions (16Gassner G.T. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12768-12785Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 24Kopp D.A. Gassner G.T. Blazyk J.L. Lippard S.J.

These proteins contain a flavin domain that transfers electrons between a nicotinamide dinucleotide and a one-electron carrier domain, which may be linked or dissociable (28Andrews S.C. Shipley D. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B.C. Harrison P.M. Guest J.R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 29Karplus P.A. Daniels M.J. Herriott J.R.

Because the electron carrier domain can be attached to either the N- or C-terminal end of the core flavin/NAD(P) unit, this domain appears to be an independent modular element. In support of this designation, the crystal structure of Burkholderia cepacia phthalate dioxygenase reductase (PDR), an FNR family member with C-terminal electron carrier connectivity, shows distinct flavin mononucleotide (FMN), NADH binding, and [2Fe-2S] domains (Fig. 1) (30Correll C.C. Batie C.J. Ballou D.P. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1992; 258: 1604-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To examine the modular nature of MMOR and facilitate characterization of this complex protein, the ferredoxin (MMOR-Fd) and FAD/NADH (MMOR-FAD) domains were expressed as separate polypeptides (31Blazyk J.L. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15780-15794Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). NMR studies reveal that both MMOR-Fd (25Müller J. Lugovskoy A.A. Wagner G. Lippard S.J.

Chatwood, J. Müller, J. D. Gross, G. Wagner, and S. J. Lippard, to be submitted for publication. form well defined structures in solution. In nearly every respect examined, the individual MMOR domains retain biochemical properties essentially identical to those of the corresponding portions of full-length MMOR. Without a covalent tether between the domains, however, the MMOR-Fd and MMOR-FAD proteins are unable to form a complex suitable for rapid interdomain electron transfer, because k = 1500 m-1 s-1 at 25 °C, compared with 90 s-1 at 4 °C for internal electron transfer between cofactors in MMOR (31Blazyk J.L. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15780-15794Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This interdomain electron transfer reaction represents the second step in the biological conveyance of electrons from NADH to MMOH.To explore further the modularity of the sMMO reductase, MMOR constructs were prepared in which the wild-type arrangement of [2Fe-2S] and FAD/NADH domains is reversed to reproduce the connectivity of PDR. The goal for this project was to determine the extent to which the rapid interdomain electron transfer of wild-type MMOR could be restored by connecting the domain proteins in a non-native fashion employed in a related protein. In this work, four linker sequences, encompassing a variety of chemical and geometric properties, were employed to tether the reversed domains; the spectroscopic, redox, and electron transfer properties of these reversed-domain MMOR constructs were determined. Through such domain engineering, the relative contributions of domain orientation, affinity, and proximity to interdomain electron transfer may be delineated.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMMOR Reversed-domain Construct Design—To define the Fd and FAD/NADH domain boundaries of M. capsulatus (Bath) MMOR and B. cepacia PDR, sections of MMOR were aligned with the full-length PDR protein sequence (PDB code 2PIA) by using ClustalW (32Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55217) Google Scholar). In addition, the approximate MMOR domain sequences (residues 1-114, Fd domain; residues 89-348, FAD/NADH domain) were compared with and aligned with other protein sequences in the non-redundant National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) protein data bases with the PSI-BLAST program (33Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59182) Google Scholar). The final domain definition technique involved examination of the PDR secondary structural features to ensure that the selected domain linker region was not the terminus of an existing α-helical or β-sheet structure. Once the domain boundaries were set, the PDR and reversed-domain MMOR sequences were aligned. A short 7-amino acid linker sequence between the domains was selected based on lower homology and lack of defined secondary structure in that region.Four different linker sequences were designed for the reversed-domain MMOR mutants. The first two 7-residue linkers were chosen with the principle of minimal perturbation. One linker was selected as the sequence in the PDR interdomain region and another as the MMOR sequence in that part. A third 7-residue linker was designed to incorporate a factor Xa protease cleavage site, which would allow the domains to be disconnected if desired. Finally, to investigate the importance of domain proximity in the MMOR intramolecular electron transfer reactions, a longer 14-residue linker was generated with the program LINKER (34Crasto C.J. Feng J. Prot. Eng. 2000; 13: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).

Each primer was purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, extracted from the gel slices by using a crush and soak method, and then precipitated to remove most of the salt added during extraction. The DNA pellets were suspended in appropriate quantities of deionized distilled water and stored at -20 °C.Construction of pTrc-Fd1 and pTrc-Fd2 Plasmids—A four-step procedure was devised for constructing the four MMOR-RD expression vectors, as depicted in Fig. 2. The mmo genes, which code for all five components of the MMO system, are contained on a 5.5-kb section of pCH4 (35Stainthorpe A.C. Murrell J.C. Salmond G.P.C. Dalton H. Lees V. Arch. Microbiol. 1989; 152: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Two variations (Fd1 and Fd2) of the Fd portion of the mmoC gene, which encodes MMOR, were amplified from pCH4 with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by using the primers LKFB10 (Fd1; 5′-CTGCGGATCCACACTATCACGGCGGTG) or LKFB20 (Fd2; 5′-AGTTGGATCCGGCCATGTTAGCGGTTATTCGCGAGTTCACACTATCACGGC) and FdRH10 (5′-CCTCTCCAAAGCTTATGCGTCAATGGGTATAG). The resulting 313-bp (Fd1) and 341-bp (Fd2) fragments were flanked by BamHI and HindIII sites (bold), which were introduced by LKFB10/LKFB20 and FdRH10, respectively. Each mmoC-Fd polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product was isolated with the QIAQuick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) and digested with BamHI (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) by following the provided instructions. The DNA was isolated from the reactions (QIAQuick PCR purification kit) and then digested with HindIII (New England Biolabs). By using the same two-step procedure, the high copy number plasmid pTrc99A (Amersham Biosciences) was digested with BamHI and HindIII. The pTrc99A digest was treated with alkaline phosphatase (AP; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to prevent recircularization in the subsequent ligation reaction. After inactivating the AP by adding 20 mm EGTA and heating at 65 °C for 10 min, DNA in the mmoC-Fd1, mmoC-Fd2, and pTrc99A digests was purified once more and ligated with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) to yield pTrc-Fd1 (pTrc99A + Fd1) and pTrc-Fd2 (pTrc99A + Fd2) (Fig. 2). The ligase was heat-inactivated, and the ligation mixtures were transformed into supercompetent Escherichia coli XL10-Gold cells (Stratagene), which were selected on Luria-Bertani (LB)-ampicillin (Ap; 100 μg/ml) agar plates. Positive clones were identified by restriction digests of DNA isolated from plasmid minipreps (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The sequences of the mmoC-Fd inserts were verified by DNA sequencing (MIT Biopolymers Laboratory).Fig. 2Scheme for construction of MMOR-RD expression vectors.E, EcoRI restriction site; B, BamHI restriction site; H, HindIII restriction site.

The 802-bp (FAD1, FAD2, and FAD3) and 795-bp (FAD4) products were flanked by EcoRI and BamHI sites (bold), which were introduced by FNFE10 and LKRB10/LKRB20/LKRB30/LKRB40, respectively. The underlined A in LKRB10, LKRB20, and LKRB30, which was required to incorporate the BamHI site, added a point mutation in the MMOR sequence that was corrected by site-directed mutagenesis in the next stage of the cloning process. After isolating the amplified DNA from the PCR reactions, all four PCR products were digested with the restriction enzymes EcoRI (New England Biolabs) and BamHI. The enzymes were heat-inactivated, and the DNA was purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit. The plasmids pTrc-Fd1 and pTrc-Fd2 were digested with the same restriction enzymes, treated with AP, and then ligated with mmoC-FAD digests to yield pTrc-RD1m (pTrc-Fd1 + FAD1), pTrc-RD2m (pTrc-Fd1 + FAD2), pTrc-RD3m (pTrc-Fd1 + FAD3), and pTrc-RD4 (pTrc-Fd2 + FAD4) (Fig. 2). The ligation products were transformed into supercompetent E. coli XL10-Gold cells, and potential positive clones were selected on LB-Ap (100 μg/ml) agar plates. Colonies with ampicillin resistance were analyzed further by restriction mapping of DNA isolated from plasmid minipreps and DNA sequencing (MIT Biopolymers Laboratory).Site-directed Mutagenesis to Yield pTrc-RD1, pTrc-RD2, and pTrc-RD3 Expression Vectors—Site-directed mutagenesis (GGATCC → GGGTCC) was performed to remove the point mutation required to introduce the BamHI site into the RD1, RD2, and RD3 reversed-domain constructs. Mutagenesis of pTrc-RD1m, pTrc-RD2m, and pTrc-RD3m was accomplished by using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and following the instructions from the manufacturer. The following primers and their reverse complements were used in the Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase-catalyzed PCR mutagenesis reaction (altered bases underlined): 5′-CCAACACGAATGCGCGGGTCCACACTATCACG (RD1), 5′-CGCCGCACAGCGGGTCCACACTATCACG (RD2), and 5′-CCATTGAGGGTCGGGTCCACACTATCACGG (RD3). Subsequent isolation and DNA sequencing (MIT Biopolymers Laboratory) of pTrc-RD1, pTrc-RD2, and pTrc-RD3 (Fig. 2) confirmed that the gene sequences contained only the desired mutations.Construction of pRED-RD1, pRED-RD2, pRED-RD3, and pRED-RD4 Expression Vectors—The final step in the reversed-domain MMOR cloning scheme (Fig. 2) involved transferring the RD1, RD2, RD3, and RD4 genes from the pTrc-RD plasmids into pKK223-3 (Amersham Biosciences), the expression vector used for the recombinant MMOR, MMOR-Fd, and MMOR-FAD expression systems (24Kopp D.A. Gassner G.T. Blazyk J.L. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14932-14941Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 31Blazyk J.L. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15780-15794Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The plasmids pKK223-3, pTrc-RD1, pTrc-RD2, pTrc-RD3, and pTrc-RD4 were each digested with EcoRI and HindIII. The mmoC-RD digests were separated from pTrc99A by resolution on a 1% agarose-ethidium bromide gel and then extracted from the gel with a QIAEX II kit (Qiagen). The pKK223-3 digest was treated with AP to prevent recircularization in the ligation reaction, the AP was inactivated, and the plasmid digest was isolated with a QIAquick PCR purification kit. T4 DNA ligase was used to ligate each mmoC-RD digest into the digested pKK223-3 vector. The resulting plasmid solutions were transformed into supercompetent E. coli XL10-Gold cells, and pKK223-3-containing cells were selected on LB-Ap (100 μg/ml) agar plates. Colonies containing pRED-RD constructs were identified by restriction mapping of DNA obtained from plasmid minipreps.Expression Trials for the Reversed-domain MMOR Proteins—The pTrc99A, pTrc-RD1, pTrc-RD2, pTrc-RD3, pTrc-RD4, pKK223-3, pRED-RD1, pRED-RD2, pRED-RD3, and pRED-RD4 plasmids (Fig. 2) were transformed into E. coli JM105 cells for expression trials. The 10 clones were grown to saturation in 4-ml LB-Ap (100 μg/ml) cultures. Aliquots (100 μl) of the saturated starter cultures were used to inoculate 50-ml quantities of LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml Ap and 500-μl quantities of 10 mm Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2·6H2O in 100 mm sodium citrate (pH 7.0), and the cells were incubated at 37 °C with shaking (200 rpm). When the A660 of the JM105/pTrc99A and JM105/pKK223-3 cultures reached ∼0.6, MMOR-RD expression was induced by adding 80 μm FeSO4 and 1.0 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG). Samples (1.0 ml) were collected from each culture just before induction, 15 min after induction, and then at 60-min intervals for the following 5 h. To separate the soluble and insoluble fractions of the MMOR-RD time-course expression samples, BugBuster protein extraction reagent (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) was used according to the instructions from the manufacturer. In brief, each cell pellet was thawed and suspended in 100 μl of BugBuster solution to which DNase had been added. The samples were gently agitated at room temperature for ∼12 min, centrifuged for 20 min at 16,000 × g to separate the soluble and insoluble cellular components, and decanted into clean tubes. The pellets were washed with 100 μl of 25 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) and then suspended in 100 μl of the same buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels.Expression and Purification of MMOR-RD Proteins—A JM105/pRED-RD1 clone was grown to saturation in 100 ml of LB-Ap (100 μg/ml) medium at 37 °C with 200 rpm shaking. To each of six 1-liter quantities of LB-Ap (100 μg/ml) medium were added 10 ml of 10 mm Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2·6H2O in 100 mm sodium citrate (pH 7.0) and 10 ml of the saturated JM105/pRED-RD1 starter culture. When the A660 reached ∼0.6, the cultures were supplemented with 80 μm FeSO4, added as 2 ml of 40 mm FeSO4·7H2O in 12.5 mm H2SO4/liter of cell culture, and induction was started by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 1.0 mm. After 4 h, the cells were collected by centrifugation, drained briefly, and then suspended in 100 ml of cold cracking buffer (25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 5 mm MgCl2, and 200 μm Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2·6H2O) containing DNase (1.5 units/ml) and 1 mm Pefabloc SC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cells were sonicated on ice with three 2-min pulses at 40% output (Branson Sonifier model 450 equipped with a 3/4-inch horn) and then centrifuged for 40 min at 98,000 × g to separate the soluble and insoluble materials. The soluble cell extract was filtered through 0.2-μm pore diameter membranes before loading onto a DEAE Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Biosciences) column (2.6 × 15 cm) equilibrated in buffer A (25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 1 mm DTT, and 50 mm NaCl). After a 120-ml wash with buffer A, proteins were eluted with a 740-ml linear gradient from buffer A to buffer B (25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 1 mm DTT, and 500 mm NaCl). Fractions containing the RD1 protein were identified by SDS-PAGE and UV-visible spectroscopy, pooled, and concentrated by ultrafiltration. This crude RD1 protein solution was diluted 5-fold with 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 2 mm DTT and applied to a 5′-AMP Sepharose (Sigma) column (2.6 × 18 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. After washing the column with buffer A to remove protein contaminants, pure MMORRD1 was eluted with buffer B containing 0.8 mm NADH. Fractions containing the MMOR-RD1 protein (PDR linker), as identified by color and SDS-PAGE, were pooled and exchanged into 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 2 mm DTT with a Biogel P6 desalting column (Bio-Rad). The MMORRD2 (MMOR linker), MMOR-RD3 (factor Xa site), and MMOR-RD4 (long linker) proteins were expressed from JM105/pRED-RD2, JM105/pRED-RD3, and JM105/pTrc-RD4, respectively, and purified by following the same protocol.Purification of MMOH, MMOB, and MMOR—MMOH was isolated from M. capsulatus (Bath) by using a slightly modified published protocol (16Gassner G.T. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12768-12785Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Pure hydroxylase contained 3.9-4.0 mol of iron/mol of protein, as determined by ferrozine iron assays (37Massey V. J. Biol.

MMOB was expressed from a recombinant E. coli system (39Coufal D.E. Blazyk J.L. Whittington D.A. Wu W.W. Rosenzweig A.C. Lippard S.J. Eur. J.

https://openalex.org/W1984505307,"ATP sulfurylase from Penicillium chrysogenum is a homohexameric enzyme that is subject to allosteric inhibition by 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate. In contrast to the wild type enzyme, recombinant ATP sulfurylase lacking the C-terminal allosteric domain was monomeric and noncooperative. All kcat values were decreased (the adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (adenylylsulfate) (APS) synthesis reaction to 17% of the wild type value). Additionally, the Michaelis constants for MgATP and sulfate (or molybdate), the dissociation constant of E·APS, and the monovalent oxyanion dissociation constants of dead end E·MgATP·oxyanion complexes were all increased.

Without the C-terminal domain, the composite k5 step (isomerization of the central complex and MgPPi release) became rate-limiting. The cumulative results indicate that besides (a) serving as a receptor for the allosteric inhibitor, the C-terminal domain (b) stabilizes the hexameric structure and indirectly, individual subunits. Additionally, (c) the domain interacts with and perfects the catalytic site such that one or more steps following the formation of the binary E·MgATP and E·SO42- complexes and preceding the release of MgPPi are optimized.

Most plants and microorganisms can use inorganic sulfate as their sole source of sulfur. Because sulfate is nonreactive at cellular temperatures and pH, the anion must first be “activated” in order to enter the mainstream of metabolism. Activation proceeds in two steps. These are catalyzed, in order, by the enzymes ATP sulfurylase (MgATP:sulfate adenylyltransferase; EC 2.7.7.4) and adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (APS) 1The abbreviations used are: APSadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (adenylylsulfate)PAPS3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (adenylylsulfate 3′-phosphate)MES(2-N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidEPPSN-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′-3 propanesulfonic acidEaArrhenius activation energynHHill coefficient. kinase (MgATP:APS 3′-phosphotransferase; EC 2.7.1.25).

ATP sulfurylase from the filamentous fungus, Penicillium chrysogenum, is a homooligomer composed of six 63.7-kDa subunits (573 residues). PAPS, the APS kinase product, is an allosteric inhibitor (1Renosto F. Martin R.L. Wailes L.M. Daley L.A. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10300-10308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2MacRae I. Segel I.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This inhibition may be part of a sequential feedback process, considering that PAPS is a major branch point metabolite in filamentous fungi but not in other organisms. (PAPS enters into the cysteine biosynthetic pathway and is also used by filamentous fungi for the formation of choline-O-sulfate, a sulfur storage compound and/or osmoprotectant (3Ballio A.

P. chrysogenum ATP sulfurylase is organized as a dimer of triads (7MacRae I.J. Segel I.H. Fisher A.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15 (abstr.): 203Google Scholar, 8MacRae I.J. Segel I.H. Fisher A.J.

Each subunit is composed of three structurally distinct globular regions. Residues 1-170 compose a distinct N-terminal domain. Residues 171-395 compose the central catalytic domain. Several residues that have been shown to be essential for activity (10Deyrup A.T. Singh B. Krishnan S. Lyle S. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28929-28936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11Venkatachalam K.V. Fuda H. Koonin E.V. Strott C.A. J. Biol.

Residues 331-389 form a small subdomain, called Domain III in the yeast structure (12Ullrich T.C. Blaesse M. Huber R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 316-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Ullrich T.C. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1117-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The allosteric site is located in a C-terminal domain that is very similar to APS kinase in sequence (14Foster B.A. Thomas S.M. Mahr J.A. Renosto F. Patel H. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19777-19786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and structure (15Lansdon E.B. Segel I.H. Fisher A.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13672-13680Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16MacRae I.J. Segel I.H. Fisher A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, this regulatory domain (residues 396-573) has no APS kinase activity because of modifications to the ATP P-loop (17MacRae I. Rose A.B. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28583-28589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and the filling of the ATP binding region with protein side chain surrogates (e.g. Phe-548, which fills the space that would otherwise be occupied by the adenine ring of ATP). PAPS is believed to initiate the allosteric transition by disrupting a salt link between Arg-515 in the C-terminal domain of one subunit and Asp-111 in the N-terminal domain of a trans-triad subunit (9MacRae I.J. Segel I.H. Fisher A.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In moving from the high substrate affinity R state to the low substrate affinity T state (18Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6145) Google Scholar, 19Rubin M.M. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 21: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 20Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. Wiley-Interscience, New York1993Google Scholar), the side chain of Arg-515 moves toward PAPS, the allosteric domain of each subunit pivots 27° relative to the catalytic and N-terminal domains, and the hexamer expands slightly in volume. The R to T transition is accompanied by the movement of a catalytic domain loop (residues 228-238, termed the active site switch), which flips “up” by 17 Å. Rotation about the interface between catalytic-allosteric domains provides the space for the switch to open. When the switch is in the closed position, Asp-234 interacts with and presumably modulates the charge on Arg-199 of the active site 197QTRN200 sulfate/phosphosulfate motif (8MacRae I.J. Segel I.H. Fisher A.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6795-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9MacRae I.J. Segel I.H. Fisher A.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We have suggested that the allosteric effector may not induce a totally new subunit conformation but rather may exploit the existing flexibility of the enzyme. Small switch movements may be part of the normal catalytic cycle, allowing each subunit to act independently with the “up” switch position corresponding to a low affinity (ligand release) conformation. A large switch movement in any one subunit may trigger the concerted allosteric transition. In order to learn more about the allosteric transition and, particularly, more about the functional relationship of the C-terminal domain to the rest of the protein, we have examined the properties of recombinant P. chrysogenum ATP sulfurylase missing residues 396-573. The results indicate that the C-terminal domain does more than just serve as a receptor for the allosteric inhibitor. Coupling Enzymes and Chemicals—Recombinant APS kinase and wild type ATP sulfurylase from P. chrysogenum were expressed and purified as described earlier (17MacRae I. Rose A.B. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28583-28589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21MacRae I.J. Hanna E. Ho J.D. Fisher A.J. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36303-36310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Yeast ATP sulfurylase was obtained from Sigma. PAPS was prepared using yeast ATP sulfurylase (A-8957; Sigma) and fungal APS kinase as described previously (2MacRae I. Segel I.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and purified by Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) chromatography using a 0-1 m NaCl gradient in 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. The pooled fractions (50 ml) contained about 2 mm PAPS and 0.3 m NaCl. (PAPS was measured by the reverse ATP sulfurylase reaction after adding nuclease P1 to convert PAPS to APS.) Most of the other assay chemicals and coupling enzymes were Sigma products as listed earlier (22Hanna E. MacRae I.J. Medina D.C. Fisher A.J. Segel I.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 406: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Protein Assays—During purification, the protein concentration was estimated from the A280 of the preparation. Specific activities of the final preparation are based on protein concentration determined with the BCA assay (46Pierce Pierce Handbook and Catalog. Pierce, Rockland, IL1989: 210-211Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. With the purified enzymes, essentially the same results were obtained using the relationship [protein]mg/ml = A280/E, where E = 0.76 for the wild type enzyme and 0.92 for the truncated enzyme (Biopolymer Calculator available on the World Wide Web at paris.chem.yale.edu/extinct.html). Similar concentrations were obtained from the A280 and A235 values (23Whitaker J.R. Granum P.E. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) or the A280 and A260 values (24Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1976: 334Google Scholar). Cloning of Truncated ATP Sulfurylase—A DNA encoding residues 1-395 of P. chrysogenum ATP sulfurylase was generated by PCR using the primers PcATS307 (5′-TAACTGCAGCATATGGCCAACCTTCACGG-3′) and PcATS321 (5′-AATCTAGATCTTTACTGGGTGGCGCGAGGG-3′), which places a stop codon after residue 395. PCR was carried out with the DNA polymerase Pfu (Stratagene) using a cloned cDNA copy of the full-length gene as the template. The PCR product was subcloned as a PstI-XbaI fragment into the plasmid pBluescript (KS+) and sequenced to ensure that no mutations arose during PCR amplification. The sequenced insert was then cloned as an NdeI-BglII fragment into the Novagen plasmid pET23a(+) and introduced into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) by electroporation for protein expression. Enzyme Expression and Purification—About 0.2 ml of an overnight culture was used to inoculate two 3-liter Fernbach flasks, each containing 1 liter of LB ampicillin medium. The cultures were grown aerobically at 37 °C until reaching an A600 of 0.8 (about 5-7 h). Cultures were subsequently cooled to 15 °C, and protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 12-16 h at 15 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 9,000-12,000 × g for 20 min. The cells were resuspended in about 40 ml of chilled 40 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 8.0 (standard buffer), containing 1 mm EDTA and lysed in a single pass through a Watts Fluidair Microfluidizer (model B12-04DJC M3). All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cell debris and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 39,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant fluid was applied to an Affi-Gel Blue column (2.5 × 10 cm) that had been previously equilibrated with standard buffer. After washing the column for 12 h at 0.6 ml/min with the same buffer, the protein was eluted at 2 ml/min with 500 ml of a 0-2 m gradient of NaCl in standard buffer. 10-ml fractions were collected, and those with the highest A280 were pooled (total volume about 70 ml) and dialyzed against standard buffer. The Affi-Gel Blue fraction was then applied to a Q-Sepharose Fastflow column (2.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated with standard buffer. After washing the column as described above, protein was eluted at 2 ml/min with a 0-1.5 m NaCl gradient in standard buffer. Two 10-ml fractions containing the highest A280 were pooled and dialyzed. When the expression level was very high and the preparation was sufficiently pure after the Affi-Gel Blue column, the enzyme was eluted from the Q-Sepharose column using a 1-2 m NaCl gradient. The final pooled preparation contained a total of about 50 mg of protein (at 2.4 mg/ml) and was at least 95% pure as judged by SDS gel electrophoresis. Enzyme Assays—ATP sulfurylase activity was measured by the continuous, coupled spectrophotometric assays described earlier (22Hanna E. MacRae I.J. Medina D.C. Fisher A.J. Segel I.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 406: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Renosto F. Martin R.L. Borrell J.L. Nelson D.C. Segel I.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 66-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Segel I.H. Renosto F. Seubert P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 334-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These include (a) molybdolysis (coupled to myokinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase), (b) APS synthesis (coupled to APS kinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase, and (c) ATP synthesis (i.e. the reverse reaction, coupled to hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase). All assay mixtures contained inorganic pyrophosphatase. Additionally, APS kinase (∼1 unit/ml) was usually included in the molybdolysis reaction mixture to remove any APS that might be produced from traces of inorganic sulfate present in the coupling enzymes, buffers, etc. (2MacRae I. Segel I.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The reaction was usually started by adding molybdate or sulfate after a 5-15-min equilibration period. After another 0.5-1 min, ΔA340 readings were recorded automatically over each 0.1-min interval for the next 2 min. The enzyme concentration was varied to yield a ΔA340 that was between 0.02 and 0.05 per min as measured on a PerkinElmer Lambda 11 spectrophotometer. APS kinase was omitted when APS was added as an inhibitor. In these experiments, the reaction was started by adding APS and molybdate simultaneously. Also, the stock MgATP solution was prepared immediately beforehand from the solid in order to minimize the content of contaminating PPi (27Daley L.A. Renosto F. Segel I.H. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). (PPi would deplete some of the APS and thus yield an artificially high Kiq value.) Unless indicated otherwise, assays were performed in 0.05 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, at 30 °C. In all cases, activity is expressed in units/mg protein, where 1 unit is equivalent to the formation of 1 μmol of primary product/min. Data Analysis—Initial velocity kinetics of the APS synthesis and molybdolysis reactions were analyzed by plots of v versus [substrate] at various fixed cosubstrate concentrations. Duplicate experiments were performed in which the substrate/cosubstrate relationship was reversed. The data for each series of plots (in the absence of PAPS, etc.) were fitted to the Henri-Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain Vmax(app) and the Km(app) for the varied substrate. Replots of Vmax(app)versus the cosubstrate concentration yielded the limiting Vmax and the Km of the cosubstrate. The same data were analyzed by double reciprocal plots and the appropriate replots. Consequently, each kinetic constant for the APS synthesis and molybdolysis reactions was determined from two or three different plots or curve fits. Activity in the ATP synthesis direction was analyzed by (a) double reciprocal plots of 1/v versus 1/[PPi] at 500 μm (saturating) APS to obtain Vmax(r) and the Michaelis constant for PPi (KmP) and (b) continuous A340 tracings at 1 mm PPi and 2 μm initial APS. In the latter, the Michaelis constant for APS (KmQ) was estimated as the concentration of APS remaining when the tracing velocity was half-maximal. (Vmax was obtained in a separate experiment at 0.2 mm APS.) The data were also fit to the integrated rate equation for a unireactant enzyme.t=KmVmaxln[S]0[S]+[S]0-[S]Vmax(Eq. 1) The inhibitory effect of PAPS was determined by fitting the vi/v0 (fractional velocity) versus [I] data to Equation 2, where vi represents the velocity in the presence of inhibitor, v0 is the velocity at the same substrate concentrations in the absence of inhibitor, Z is the starting value of vi/v0 at [I] = 0, M is the maximum change in vi/v0, [I] is the inhibitor concentration, nH is the Hill coefficient, and K is a constant. (K is equivalent to [I]0.5nH.) Theoretically, Z = 1.0. If saturating PAPS drives the velocity to zero, M would also equal 1.0.viv0=Z-M*[I]nHK+[I]nH(Eq. 2) The limiting Ki values for thiosulfate, monovalent oxyanions, and APS and for PAPS binding to the catalytic site of the truncated enzyme were determined from double reciprocal plots and slope replots. The Ki for PAPS binding to the truncated enzyme was also estimated from the [I]0.5(app) value of a vi/v0versus [PAPS] plot at fixed subsaturating [MgATP] and [MoO42-].Ki=[I]0.5(app)1+[A]Kia+[B]Kib+[A][B]KiaKmB(Eq. 3) DeltaGraph Pro 4.05c was used for all curve fits. Kinetic constants are reported as the mean determined from multiple experiments (or multiple plots/curve fits). The maximum variations were generally less than ±15% of the mean. Native and Subunit Molecular Mass—The truncated enzyme was active and eluted from a Sephacryl S-100-HR column at a position partially overlapping (but slightly behind) that of fungal APS kinase (47.4 kDa). SDS gel electrophoresis yielded a subunit size of about 46 kDa. The theoretical subunit mass is 44 kDa, so it appears that the truncated enzyme is monomeric. Wild type fungal ATP sulfurylase is a hexamer organized as a dimer of triads in the shape of a flattened ellipsoid 134 Å in diameter × 73 Å (8MacRae I.J. Segel I.H. Fisher A.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6795-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Each triad is stabilized by the head-to-tail interaction of a catalytic domain of one subunit with the C-terminal domain of the next. In addition, each C-terminal domain interacts across the triad interface with an N-terminal domain, a catalytic domain, and another C-terminal domain. Considering the many oligomer-stabilizing interactions of the C-terminal domain, it is not surprising that its absence results in a monomeric enzyme. Stability of the Truncated Enzyme—Truncated P. chrysogenum ATP sulfurylase is much less heat-stable than the wild type enzyme. At temperatures above 30 °C, activity is lost in a first order fashion, as shown in Fig. 1A. To obtain a comparable series of inactivation curves for the wild type enzyme, a temperature range of 55-65 °C is required (Fig. 1B). For example, t½ for inactivation of the truncated enzyme at 50 °C is about 0.3 min, whereas the wild type enzyme is stable for >2 h at that temperature. At 45 °C, the truncated enzyme has a t1/2 of about 1.5 min. To obtain the same t½ for the wild type enzyme, T must be increased to about 62 °C. Ea values for inactivation of the wild type and truncated enzymes are 107 and 62.3 kcal/mol, respectively (Fig. 1C). Clearly, hexamerization not only provides the means of propagating a concerted allosteric transition (18Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6145) Google Scholar, 19Rubin M.M. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 21: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 20Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. Wiley-Interscience, New York1993Google Scholar) but also confers thermal stability. This was not surprising, considering the multiple contacts made by each C-terminal domain of the wild type enzyme as noted above. Sensitivity to Sulfhydryl and Arginine-targeted Reagents— Preincubation of the wild type enzyme (15 nm in active sites in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 30 °C) with 50 μm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) or 150 μmN-ethylmaleimide resulted in a rapid decrease in activity subsequently measured at 50 μm MgATP and 100 μmMoO42- (subsaturating substrate levels). The t½ values for the two reagents were 20 and 45 s, respectively. This apparent inactivation (which is observed only at subsaturating substrate levels) is caused by increases in the [S]0.5 values for both substrates concomitant with the induction of sigmoidal kinetics (28Renosto F. Martin R.L. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16279-16288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under the same preincubation conditions, the truncated enzyme retained >97% of its activity after 30 min. The results confirm that the effect of SH-reactive reagents on the wild type enzyme resulted solely from Cys-509 modification. Two other Cys residues (located in the N-terminal domain at positions 42 and 69) appear to be inaccessible to 5,5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) and N-ethylmaleimide. Both forms of the enzyme were irreversibly inactivated by 3 mm phenylglyoxal, an arginine-targeted reagent (29Means G.E. Feeney R.E. Chemical Modification of Proteins. Holden-Day, Inc., San Francisco1971: 254Google Scholar). (Activity was measured at 5 mm MgATP and 5 mmMoO42-). Whereas there are many Arg residues in ATP sulfurylase, the loss of activity must result, at least in part, from modification of Arg-199 at the active site. (Substrates protect against inactivation (28Renosto F. Martin R.L. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16279-16288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The t½ values were 5 min for both forms of the enzyme, indicating no major difference in the accessibility of essential Arg residues. pH Profiles—At 1 mm MgATP and 5 mm molybdate, the molybdolysis reaction rates were nearly constant between pH 6.5 and 9.5 for both the wild type and the truncated enzyme (Fig. 2A). At subsaturating substrate concentrations, the wild type enzyme displayed what appeared to be a typical “pH optimum” curve, but the response of the truncated enzyme was still essentially flat (Fig. 2B). Consequently, the usual explanations for the pH effect were inapplicable; i.e. the decrease in activity at lower pH values displayed by the wild type enzyme cannot be attributed to a reduction in the level of the true substrate, MgATP2- (which would be minimal anyway (30Storer A.C. Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem. J. 1976; 159: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 31Wood H.G. Davis J.J. Lochmüller H. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 5692-5704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Nor could it result from protonation of essential His residues (10Deyrup A.T. Singh B. Krishnan S. Lyle S. Schwartz N.B. J.

Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 22: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 33Veitch D.P. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10743-10750Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). If these causes were relevant, the truncated enzyme would have behaved the same way. It is more likely that the decrease in activity exhibited by the wild type enzyme at low pH reflects its transition to the high substrate Km T state (21MacRae I.J. Hanna E. Ho J.D. Fisher A.J. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36303-36310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), a shift denied to the truncated enzyme. The Scatchard plots shown in Fig. 2C confirm that the wild type enzyme behaves cooperatively at pH 6.5, but the truncated enzyme displays normal hyperbolic behavior. Inhibition by PAPS—At 0.5 mm MgATP and 0.1 mm molyb-date, the wild type enzyme displayed a sigmoidal PAPS inhibition curve with nH = 2.6 and a [PAPS]0.5 of about 40 μm (Fig. 3). In contrast, neither the truncated P. chrysogenum enzyme nor the yeast enzyme showed cooperative inhibition. The [PAPS]0.5 values combined with the experimental substrate concentrations and the appropriate kinetic constants (see Equation 3, Table I, and Ref. 14Foster B.A. Thomas S.M. Mahr J.A. Renosto F. Patel H. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19777-19786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) yielded estimates for the limiting Ki values in the region of 60 and 180 μm for the truncated P. chrysogenum and yeast enzymes, respectively. The inhibition of the noncooperative enzymes almost certainly results from PAPS binding to the APS subsite of the catalytic domain. PAPS is, after all, a nearly perfect structural analog of APS, and the crystal structures indicate that only small changes in the structure of the active site region are needed to accommodate the 3′-phospho group (although it is likely that the PAPS affinity of the wild type enzyme's active site is closer to that of the hexameric yeast enzyme than to that of the truncated P. chrysogenum enzyme). A more detailed analysis of the inhibition of the truncated enzyme (Fig. 4) yielded a limiting Ki of 71 μm, considerably greater than the Kiq of 0.5 μm for APS binding to its active site (see below), but still substantial. The binding of PAPS to the catalytic site as well as to the allosteric site of the wild type enzyme acts to decrease the degree of cooperativity that would otherwise be observed.Table IKinetic constants of P. chrysogenum ATP sulfurylase Constants were determined in Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 30 °C.

Despite the multitude of cohesin functions in vivo, little is known about the mechanism of cohesin association with its DNA/chromatin target. It is believed that the SMC core of the cohesin complex (Smc1p-Smc3p) forms either a DNA-binding bridge (19Hirano T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 115-144Google Scholar) between the two sister DNA molecules or “embraces” two sister chromatids (20Haering C.H. Lowe J. Hochwagen A. Nasmyth K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 773-788Google Scholar). The role of the non-SMC cohesin subunits (Scc1p/Mcd1p and Scc3p) is to promote the establishment (20Haering C.H. Lowe J. Hochwagen A. Nasmyth K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 773-788Google Scholar, 21Losada A. Hirano T. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 268-272Google Scholar) and breakage (22Uhlmann F. Lottspeich F. Nasmyth K. Nature. 1999; 400: 37-42Google Scholar) of these SCC links in the course of the cell cycle. However, experimental evidence for direct cohesin-DNA interaction is rather limited (21Losada A. Hirano T. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 268-272Google Scholar, 23Akhmedov A.T. Frei C. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. Kemper B. Gasser S.M. Jessberger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24088-24094Google Scholar). The inability to detect sequence-specific cohesin-DNA interactions supports the suggestion that the interaction of cohesin with DNA is more topological in nature (24Gruber S. Haering C.H. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2003; 112: 765-777Google Scholar). However, even the most recent data cannot explain the S-phase requirements (4Uhlmann F. Nasmyth K. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1095-1101Google Scholar) for the de novo formation of an SCC site, the mechanisms that determine the placement of heritable cohesion sites in vivo (25Tanaka T. Cosma M.P. Wirth K.

Cell. 2000; 100: 619-633Google Scholar) versus the stable SCC sites on chromosome arms. The obscurity of molecular mechanisms of cohesin activity in vivo highlights the necessity of reconstituting cohesin activity in vitro. Chromatin cannot be ignored while designing such an in vitro model, as it was recently shown that cohesin binding to heterochromatin in vivo is dependent on a specific site of histone H3 methylation (16Nonaka N. Kitajima T. Yokobayashi S. Xiao G. Yamamoto M. Grewal S.I. Watanabe Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 89-93Google Scholar, 29Sonoda E. Matsusaka T. Morrison C. Vagnarelli P. Hoshi O. Ushiki T. Nojima K.

Science. 2001; 294: 2539-2542Google Scholar). Even though this histone modification is not found in S. cerevisiae (31Briggs S.D. Bryk M. Strahl B.D. Cheung W.L. Davie J.K. Dent S.Y. Winston F. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3286-3295Google Scholar), it is conceivable that chromatin structure may play an active role in the establishment of SCC and/or in the placement of cohesin-binding sites (25Tanaka T. Cosma M.P. Wirth K. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1999; 98: 847-858Google Scholar). In this report we characterize cohesin interaction with chromatin in vitro and show that chromatin is likely the preferred substrate for cohesin binding over naked DNA. We also demonstrate that cohesin-chromatin interaction is independent of histone tails and does not protect linker DNA. This allows us to propose a model for the binding of two chromatin fibers by the cohesin holocomplex, which partially agrees with the embrace-like model of SCC establishment (24Gruber S. Haering C.H. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2003; 112: 765-777Google Scholar). Estimation of Minimal Cohesin-binding Site in Yeast—Yeast strains were of S288c or W303 background. The 2-YPH499bp3/pAS630/1 strain (smc3:HA::URA3) with a yeast DNA-only circular minichromosome pAS630/1 (3,629 bp) was used for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) (32Meluh P.B. Koshland D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3401-3412Google Scholar). pAS630/1 was constructed from a shuttle plasmid pAS630 (6.1 kb) by deleting the majority of non-yeast DNA (XbaI-SpeI digest), followed by ligation and direct transformation into yeast cells. pAS630 was YCPlca111 with an XbaI linker inserted into the AatII site. Under selective conditions (media without leucine), the pAS630/1 copy number increased to an average of five copies per cell (as determined by quantitative PCR), probably due to a negative effect of minichromosome size on the LEU2 expression. This copy number increase allowed us to separate the ChIP signal generated by the plasmid sequences, some of which there also present in the 2-YPH499bp3 chromosomes (numbers 1, 3, 4, 7, and 12), by diluting the ChIP DNA so that chromosomal cohesin-bound sequences were not amplified (verified by the CEN8 vicinity ChIP). For native chromatin purification (Fig. 1, B and C) 2 liters of yeast BY4733bp3 (SCC3:12His:3HA::URA3) (30 °C; OD600 = 1.5) were used for nuclei preparation (33Loo S. Rine J. Science. 1994; 264: 1768-1771Google Scholar). Nuclei were treated with micrococcal nuclease (MN) (1 × 106 units for 15 min at 37 °C) in 20 mmt Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm AEBSF, 4 mm CaCl2, and 10% glycerol. Nuclei were spun down (15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and nuclear extract was separated on sucrose gradient (5–30%, for 16 h at 35,000 × g at 4 °C) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl. For Fig. 1C, the sucrose gradient fraction 15 was dialyzed (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm AEBSF, and 0.01% Triton X-100) and incubated with anti-Mcd1 affinity resin (12 h for 4 °C). The resin was packed into a column, washed, and eluted with 2% SDS. Serum depleted of specific anti-Mcd1 antibodies was used as a control. Antibodies—Antibodies to Scc3p were prepared as described (34Freeman L. Aragon-Alcaide L. Strunnikov A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 811-824Google Scholar) using a synthetic peptide (SynPep) cENPEPNKKNIQKAKSNQTQREKAPLQPNSERETD as immunogen. Other antibodies were from commercial sources or were described previously (2Guacci V. Koshland D. Strunnikov A. Cell. 1997; 91: 47-57Google Scholar, 6Strunnikov A.V. Larionov V.L. Koshland D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1635-1648Google Scholar). Recombinant Cohesin Purification—Recombinant cohesin subunits were first individually expressed both with a His6 tag (pFastBAC-HTb) and without (pFastBAC1). Recombinant proteins were tested for solubility in EBX200 (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm Na4P2O7,10mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% Triton X-100), and recombinant viruses were amplified in SF9 cells. The HiFive cells were then co-infected with recombinant baculoviruses expressing 6HisSmc1p, Smc3p, Scc3p, and Scc1p/Mcd1p at 10× multiplicity of infection. Assembled cohesin was captured on the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin (Qiagen) in EBX200 buffer with 5 mm imidazole, eluted with 500 mm imidazole, and then applied to a HR10/30 Superose-6 column in EBX200 buffer. DNA Binding Assay—For Fig. 2A, four 350-bp fragments of DNA, corresponding to in vivo sites with variable strength of cohesin binding, were made by PCR and cloned. The fragments were excised from the plasmids, labeled, and compared in an agarose gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The following fragments were used: DMC1-proximal site (site 548.7 in Ref. 25Tanaka T. Cosma M.P. Wirth K. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1999; 98: 847-858Google Scholar), primers 5′-TGGAAAAAATTAAAGAAGCTGCTGGA-3′ and 5′-TGCCAAACATGACTCGGGATCCAATT-3′; DMC1-distal site (549.5 in Ref. 25Tanaka T. Cosma M.P. Wirth K. Nasmyth K.

Because cohesin binds ATP and has a weak ATPase activity not stimulated by DNA, 1 mm ATP was used in all subsequent assays, except in Fig. 4A. The 350-bp EcoRI fragments were labeled using Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs) with [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP at 37 °C for 1 h, purified on a 0.8% agarose gel, and used as probes (0.1 ng at 1,000 cpm) in EMSA. The binding reaction (30 min at 23 °C in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 5% glycerol with 5 ng of protein and 1 or 10 ng of poly(dI-dC) as a competitor) was followed by gel separation (0.8% agarose and 0.3× Tris borate-EDTA). Gels were fixed (20% methanol and 20% acetic acid for 30 min), dried, and exposed in a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).Fig. 4Characterization of the specific chromatin-cohesin complex.A, cohesin forms a specific histone-tail and an ATP-independent complex with dinucleosome.

Chandler S. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8629-8636Google Scholar, 36Simon R.H. Camerini-Otero R.D. Felsenfeld G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 4805-4818Google Scholar), were used to assemble nucleosomes by the salt dialysis method (37Chandler S.P. Guschin D. Landsberger N. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7008-7018Google Scholar) on the 350-bp EcRI DNA fragments (0.1 ng at 1000 cpm), end-labeled using Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs) with [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP, and analyzed by EMSA on 0.8% agarose gel (15V/cm for 120 min in 0.3× Tris borate-EDTA). To characterize the association of cohesin with chromatin, the defined labeled chromatin probe was prepared and purified as follows. 15 μg of H1-depleted chicken chromatin fragments, isolated as described (35Guschin D. Chandler S. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8629-8636Google Scholar, 36Simon R.H. Camerini-Otero R.D. Felsenfeld G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 4805-4818Google Scholar), were used to assemble two nucleosomes on 1 μg of a 380-bp HindIII/NotI fragment of DNA (a tandem repeat of the 5 S rRNA gene from Xenopus borealis (38Ura K. Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3752-3765Google Scholar, 39Ghidelli S. Donze D. Dhillon N. Kamakaka R.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4522-4535Google Scholar) end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP with a Bst polymerase large fragment) by the salt dialysis method. The resulting chromatin fragment was purified on a 5–20% sucrose gradient (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.25 mm AEBSF). Fractions were analyzed on a 4% acrylamide gel. Fractions containing the defined chromatin fragment with two positioned nucleosomes (dinucleosome) had no free histones or naked DNA. Dinucleosomes were stored at 4 °C after concentration with Centricon-100. To create a tailless dinucleosome, chromatin was treated with 1 μg of modified trypsin (Roche Applied Science) immediately after reconstitution (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH8, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA for 10 min at 37°). The reaction was stopped with 5 μl of 0.25 m AEBSF and 5 μl of 5 mg/ml Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone and purified on a sucrose gradient as described above. Cohesin-Dinucleosome Binding Assays—In a typical chromatin EMSA, 5 ng of cohesin complex (20–50 ng in Figs. 3, B and C, and 4C) was incubated in a binding reaction (20 min at 25 °C) with 1 ng of dinucleosome (1,000 cpm) in EX buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 5% glycerol) with no competitor or with a 3 or 30-fold excess of a cold 5 S DNA fragment. The reaction was analyzed on a 0.8% agarose gel (15V/cm for 120 min with 0.3× Tris borate-EDTA), and gels were autoradiographed. The dinucleosome ladder was prepared by ligation of purified dinucleosomes (3 μl) with 5 units of T4 DNA ligase for 15 min at 25 °C. For Fig. 3C, the Esp1p protease fused to the chitin-binding domain and the FLAG tags was expressed in the strain 4363 (40Uhlmann F. Wernic D. Poupart M.A. Koonin E.V. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2000; 103: 375-386Google Scholar) transformed with the pOC69 plasmid (O. Cohen-Fix) expressing Pds1p under control of the GAL promoter. Two 250-ml yeast cultures were grown to the mid-log phase in yeast extract/peptone/raffinose media and arrested with 0.2 m hydroxyurea. Then, galactose was added to 1% to one culture to induce Esp1p-CBD and Pds1p. After 5 h, the media was changed back to yeast extract/peptone/raffinose. 75 min after release, cells (mostly mitotic) were harvested, and both Esp1p-CBD and mock extracts were subjected to purification using chitin beads as described (40Uhlmann F. Wernic D. Poupart M.A. Koonin E.V. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2000; 103: 375-386Google Scholar). The resulting Esp1 fraction was able to cleave the cohesin holocomplex in vitro even without inhibition of phosphatases (40Uhlmann F. Wernic D. Poupart M.A. Koonin E.V. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2000; 103: 375-386Google Scholar) and, thus, was referred to as “activated Esp1”. After standard incubation of cohesin with a dinucleosome (as in Fig. 3B), reactions were overlaid onto 10 μl of beads with immobilized Esp1p (or mock), washed with 1× reaction buffer (as before), and incubated at 30 °C with rotation. Beads were allowed to sediment, and supernatants were loaded onto a 0.8% agarose gel and separated as described above. To test dinucleosomal DNA linker accessibility (Fig. 4E) an intermediate concentration of MN and EcoRI was selected, allowing visualization of both uncut and cut molecules of DNA. Either EcoRI (3 units) or MN (10 units) was added to the pre-bound complexes between dinucleosomes and a saturating amount of cohesin (20 ng) in 15-μl total volume and incubated in EX buffer with 4 mm CaCl2 (5min at 25 °C). Reactions were stopped with 10 mm EDTA, and DNA was phenol-extracted and separated on a 5% acrylamide gel, followed by autoradiography. Direct histone tail binding by cohesin was tested as follows. Escherichia coli-expressed Drosophila histone tails fused to glutathione S-transferase (41Georgel P.T. Tsukiyama T. Wu C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4717-4726Google Scholar) were purified on glutathione-Sepharose, immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose, and tested for interaction with cohesin in EX buffer (4 h at 4 °C and 30 min at 25 °C) in batch mode. After washing with EX buffer, columns were stripped with 2% SDS, and the resulting eluates were analyzed by Western blotting. As a first step toward reconstitution of cohesin activity in vitro, we estimated the minimal size of chromatin fragments bound to cohesin in living cells. This parameter has never been precisely determined, as relevant ChIP data on cohesin-binding sites available have a resolution of no finer than 1 kb (25Tanaka T. Cosma M.P. Wirth K. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1999; 98: 847-858Google Scholar, 26Megee P.C. Mistrot C. Guacci V. Koshland D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 445-450Google Scholar, 42Blat Y. Kleckner N. Cell. 1999; 98: 249-259Google Scholar). That does not provide sufficient guidance for design of an adequate binding target for the in vitro studies. To characterize the minimal unit of SCC, we followed two approaches. First, we created a small minichromosome containing essentially no plasmid or bacterial sequences, probably extremely topologically constrained in vivo due to its small size (3.6 kb). This approach allowed us to limit the extensive (several kb) spreading of cohesin from the peak at the centromere, which was previously observed in native chromosomes (25Tanaka T. Cosma M.P. Wirth K. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1999; 98: 847-858Google Scholar), and to reveal the minimal-size cohesion sites essential for proper segregation. Fig. 1A shows the results of the Smc3p-HA ChIP of this minichromosome. The most robust cohesin association was restricted to a short (300 bp) CDEI-adjacent region of the minichromosomal CEN4 (Fig. 1A, white box). Two other binding sites were also detected (Fig. 1A) and also limited to 300 bp in both cases. As a second approach, we purified and analyzed the chromatin-bound cohesin pool (Fig. 1, B and C). After digestion of yeast chromatin with MN (Fig. 1B) to saturation and purification of the resulting nucleoprotein complexes using sucrose gradient centrifugation and immunoaffinity chromatography, we analyzed fractions for the presence of the cohesin subunits, the chromatin marker Hmo1p (Fig. 1C), and DNA. Analysis of the gradient fractions indicates that cohesin preferably associated with the higher molecular weight chromatin fractions within the peak containing dinucleosomal DNA (fractions 15 and 16, Fig. 1C). Cohesin-containing chromatin fractions also contained only a small fraction of Hmo1p, as was expected in view of the sparse spacing of SCC sites in vivo (43Laloraya S. Guacci V. Koshland D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1047-1056Google Scholar). After immunoaffinity purification of cohesin from fraction 15 using an anti-Mcd1p antibody resin, it was observed that cohesin was still associated with Hmo1p (even as the latter was partially depleted), indicating persistent association of cohesin with the dinucleosome-sized chromatin fragments. Thus, we established that chromatin, digested to dinucleosomal length, still co-purified with cohesin and, therefore, the size of a minimal cohesin binding unit in vivo is likely comparable with the size of two nucleosomes or even smaller. We used this result as a guide for the design of DNA probes in all subsequent experiments. Because active cohesin is tightly associated with chromatin in yeast, we purified a recombinant cohesin complex using the baculovirus expression system. After achieving the maximal expression levels of individual subunits (Fig. 1D), they were co-expressed in insect cells, and the resulting yeast recombinant cohesin was purified (Fig. 1E). Poor solubility of Scc1p/Mcd1p was the main factor limiting the yield of recombinant holocomplex, as untagged Scc1p/Mcd1p expressed alone was virtually insoluble. Yet, >20% of recombinant Scc1p/Mcd1p was found to be soluble when co-expressed with other subunits, indicating that assembly of cohesin did occur upon co-expression. After purification in a complex that was ∼95% pure, cohesin subunits were present in a near 1:1:1:1 ratio (Fig. 1E), according to the gel density scan. Subsequent purification of the complex resulted repeatedly in progressive loss of the Scc3p subunit, consistent with the findings for Schizosaccharomyces pombe cohesin purification (7Tomonaga T. Nagao K. Kawasaki Y. Furuya K. Murakami A. Morishita J. Yuasa T. Sutani T. Kearsey S.E. Uhlmann F. Nasmyth K. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2757-2770Google Scholar). Human cohesin was previously shown to have nonspecific DNA binding activity in vitro (44Losada A. Hirano T. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 924-935Google Scholar). We therefore tested the recombinant yeast cohesin complex for DNA binding (Fig. 2A). Instead of the random DNA fragments used in preceding studies, we used the four probes corresponding to yeast genomic sites with the known SCC potential. Unfortunately, only very few genomic sites have been verified as strong cohesin-negative or cohesin-positive, and even fewer strong SCC sites have been validated using the mutants defective for cohesin-chromatin association (25Tanaka T. Cosma M.P. Wirth K. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1999; 98: 847-858Google Scholar). The recombinant yeast cohesin (Fig. 1E) demonstrated robust DNA binding activity (Fig. 2A) that was ATP-independent but sensitive to heat inactivation (not shown). All four genomic sites associated with recombinant cohesin regardless of their binding to cohesin in vivo, yet did not form a defined complex of a specific size (Fig. 2A) at any DNA-protein ratio. This indicates that cohesin does not establish a stoichiometric complex with naked DNA in vitro (see also Fig. 5). This DNA binding was also sensitive to poly(dI-dC) and, therefore, was not sequence-specific (Fig. 2A). Thus, despite its substantial DNA binding activity, cohesin cannot discriminate in vitro between the DNA sequences corresponding to functional SCC sites and DNA derived from the sites with no cohesin binding in vivo. These results indicate that some additional factors might be involved in the selection and formation of SCC sites in vivo. An important factor potentially facilitating formation of an SCC site in vivo is chromatin itself (25Tanaka T. Cosma M.P. Wirth K. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1999; 98: 847-858Google Scholar, 30Bernard P. Maure J.F. Partridge J.F. Genier S. Javerzat J.P. Allshire R.C. Science. 2001; 294: 2539-2542Google Scholar). Indeed, cohesin was found in a complex with chromatin in our experiments (Fig. 1C). Also, at least in the case of pericentromeric SCC, cohesin must cohabit with the underlying phased nucleosomes (45Bloom K.S. Carbon J. Cell. 1982; 29: 305-317Google Scholar). In chromosomal regions elsewhere, cohesin was also shown to target chromatin with phased nucleosomal structure, i.e. heterochromatin (16Nonaka N. Kitajima T. Yokobayashi S. Xiao G. Yamamoto M. Grewal S.I. Watanabe Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 89-93Google Scholar, 17Donze D. Adams C.R. Rine J. Kamakaka R.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 698-708Google Scholar, 30Bernard P. Maure J.F. Partridge J.F. Genier S. Javerzat J.P. Allshire R.C. Science. 2001; 294: 2539-2542Google Scholar, 43Laloraya S. Guacci V. Koshland D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1047-1056Google Scholar). We tested the ability of the DNA fragments, used in Fig. 2A to analyze binding of cohesin to DNA, to deposit and position nucleosomes. We found that the SCC sites (CEN4 and DMC1, proximal and distal) were good positioning sequences for either mono or dinucleosomes, whereas the site that does not bind cohesin in vivo (FAU1′) showed little nucleosome positioning (Fig. 2B). This observation raises a possibility that phased nucleosomes are the natural substrates for cohesin binding in vivo. Based on the fact that naked DNA evidently does not carry enough information to determine its cohesin-binding potential (Fig. 2A), we tested chromatin-binding properties of recombinant cohesin in vitro. We used a nucleosome-positioning sequence of 5 S rRNA gene from X. borealis (38Ura K. Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3752-3765Google Scholar, 39Ghidelli S. Donze D. Dhillon N. Kamakaka R.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4522-4535Google Scholar) to generate a defined chromatin substrate (dinucleosome) for cohesin binding. The choice of dinucleosome was determined by its similarity to a natural chromatin fragment, i.e. existence of two nucleosomes separated by linker DN"

https://openalex.org/W1983261435,"The conversion of skeletal myoblasts to terminally differentiated myocytes is negatively controlled by several growth factors and oncoproteins. In this study, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which v-Src, a prototypic tyrosine kinase, perturbs myogenesis in primary avian myoblasts and in established murine C2C12 satellite cells. We determined the expression levels of the cell cycle regulators pRb, cyclin D1 and D3 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 in v-Src-transformed myoblasts and found that, in contrast to myogenin, they are normally modulated by differentiative cues, implying that v-Src affects myogenesis independent of cell proliferation. We then examined the levels of expression, DNA-binding ability and transcription-activation potentials of myogenic regulatory factors in transformed myoblasts and in myotubes after reactivation of a temperature-sensitive allele of v-Src. Our results reveal two distinct potential modes of repression targeted to myogenic factors. On the one hand, we show that v-Src reversibly inhibits the expression of MyoD and myogenin in C2C12 cells and of myogenin in quail myoblasts. Remarkably, these loci become resistant to activation of the kinase in the postmitotic compartment. On the other hand, we demonstrate that v-Src efficiently inhibits muscle gene expression by repressing the transcriptional activity of myogenic factors without affecting MyoD DNA-binding activity. Indeed, forced expression of MyoD and myogenin allows terminal differentiation of transformed myoblasts. Finally, we found that ectopic expression of the coactivator p300 restores transcription from extrachromosomal muscle-specific promoters."
https://openalex.org/W1821814477,"In addition to its remarkable supernova signature1,2, the γ-ray burst of 29 March 2003 (GRB030329) had two interesting peculiarities: an unusually low-energy output in γ-rays and a large bump in its afterglow light curve after 1–2 days (followed by several less significant rebrightening episodes). We suggest that refreshed shocks — slow shells ejected from the source that catch up with the afterglow shock a relatively long time after the initial burst — produced the observed fluctuations in the early afterglow light curve and explain the low-energy output at early times."
