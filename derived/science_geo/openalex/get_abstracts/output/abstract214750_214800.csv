The cardinal symptoms of this syndrome are: (a) an inability to form social relationships; (b) an ‘obsessive insistence on the preservation of sameness’. The latter feature often has the corollary that catastrophic reactions are provoked by the introduction of novelty or the change of an established routine. A catastrophic reaction closely resembles infantile rage, consisting of screaming, weeping, threshing movements of arms and legs and sometimes self-directed aggression such as biting the limbs."

https://openalex.org/W1993084223,"To demonstrate the proteolytic enzymes in an electropherogram, Uriel et al.1,2 dipped an electropherogram into a substrate solution of an appropriate pH and, after an incubation period of some hours, the electropherogram was stained with amido black. Light spots indicated the presence of proteolytic enzymes. In their immunological work, Raunio and Gabriel3 used a second slide covered with substrate in agar to find the precipitation lines that had proteolytic activity. Here, too, the disappearance of substrate through enzymatic activity is demonstrated by staining the protein. With these publications in mind, we developed a simple and rapid method for localizing enzymatic activities in agar electropherograms."

Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) is of special interest, because of the knowledge we have of its isozyme composition4,5. To investigate whether ageing affects each isozyme to the same degree, the electrophoretic pattern of LDH isozymes of young and old red cells were compared."

https://openalex.org/W2081953707,"THE application of autoradiographic techniques in the localization of radioactively labelled compounds in cells by electron microscopy has been developed by a number of workers1. The direct coating of ultra-thin sections with photographic emulsion has the disadvantage that long exposure times are required to obtain positive autoradiographs. Furthermore, it is difficult to locate labelled cells in the electron microscope by this method when their frequency is low. In the experiments recorded here the characteristics of the ultrastructure of cells in DNA synthesis were examined by using a ‘thick–thin’ technique2. Two examples of proliferation in atypical lymphocytes were investigated by this method: normal human lymphocytes cultured with phytohæmagglutinin3–5, and freshly isolated leucocytes from patients suffering from infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever). The cells were incubated with thymidine (3HT) (10 mc./ml., specific activity 1.9 c./mmole) for 30 min and then fixed with osmic acid and embedded in methacrylate. A thick section (about 0.25µ) was cut from a suitable part of the block and mounted on a glass slide. The contiguous ultra-thin section was then cut and mounted on an electron microscope grid. The methacrylate was removed from the thick section with chloroform and the section coated with Ilford L4 emulsion and stored at 4° C. Three weeks later it was developed in Kodak D19B and stained with toluidine blue. A map of the whole section was made from a mosaic of light photomicrographs and the cells with positive autoradiographs noted. This map was used to locate the position of the DNA-synthesizing cells in the ultra-thin section, which were then examined and photographed in the electron microscope."

The compound is not included in the determination of fusel oils by the colorimetric procedures usually adopted8,9. The methods described have certain disadvantages: preliminary extraction may be incomplete unless prolonged, absorption measurements may involve previous purification of the fraction containing 2-phenyl-ethanol, and in the gas chromatographic methods described the retention time of the compound may exceed 1 h with column temperatures above 100°. The method to be described is simple in operation and has been found satisfactory for cider: by the use of a column of low capacity of the type described by Hishta et al.10 the retention time of 2-phenylethanol has been reduced to 8 min."

https://openalex.org/W4234114349,"IN view of the present-day interest in methylated purines as minor components of RNA and DNA1, and their possible role in mutagenesis, carcinogenesis2 and protein synthesis3, the preparation of N-methylated purine nucleosides and nucleotides has attracted increased attention4–6. One of the aims of these investigations is to find the reactive sites of the purine bases toward alkylating agents."

During the past decade several compounds have been found to have activity against these worms. These compounds are ‘Phthalofyne’ orally1 or intravenously2, dithiazanine iodide3, stilbazium iodide4,5, and ‘Glycobiarsol’6. However, most of these drugs require large doses in mg/kg or a series of doses, or they have undesirable side-effects, or the worm loss is not high enough. Among the numerous modifications of stilbazium iodide4 which were prepared, a number of members of the dipyrryl vinyl pyridines were found to have activity against the dog whipworm, Trichuris vulpis."
