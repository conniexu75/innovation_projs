https://openalex.org/W152391151,"One strategy that is being pursued to tackle the international problem of actinide contamination of soils, sediments and water is to use microbial activity to 'fix' these radionuclides into an insoluble form that cannot be readily dispersed. Here we show that uraninite (UO(2)) particles formed from uranium in sediments by bacterial reduction are typically less than 2 nanometres across and that the small size has important implications for uraninite reactivity and fate. Because these tiny particles may still be transported in an aqueous environment, precipitation of uranium as insoluble uraninite cannot be presumed to immobilize it."
https://openalex.org/W2131907269,"During translation, the first encounter of nascent polypeptides is with the ribosome-associated chaperones that assist the folding process--a principle that seems to be conserved in evolution. In Escherichia coli, the ribosome-bound Trigger Factor chaperones the folding of cytosolic proteins by interacting with nascent polypeptides. Here we identify a ribosome-binding motif in the amino-terminal domain of Trigger Factor. We also show the formation of crosslinked products between Trigger Factor and two adjacent ribosomal proteins, L23 and L29, which are located at the exit of the peptide tunnel in the ribosome. L23 is essential for the growth of E. coli and the association of Trigger Factor with the ribosome, whereas L29 is dispensable in both processes. Mutation of an exposed glutamate in L23 prevents Trigger Factor from interacting with ribosomes and nascent chains, and causes protein aggregation and conditional lethality in cells that lack the protein repair function of the DnaK chaperone. Purified L23 also interacts specifically with Trigger Factor in vitro. We conclude that essential L23 provides a chaperone docking site on ribosomes that directly links protein biosynthesis with chaperone-assisted protein folding."

https://openalex.org/W1508314530,"Mexican wave, or La Ola, first widely broadcasted during the 1986 World Cup held in Mexico, is a human wave moving along the stands of stadiums as one section of spectators stands up, arms lifting, then sits down as the next section does the same. Here we use variants of models originally developed for the description of excitable media to demonstrate that this collective human behaviour can be quantitatively interpreted by methods of statistical physics. Adequate modelling of reactions to triggering attempts provides a deeper insight into the mechanisms by which a crowd can be stimulated to execute a particular pattern of behaviour and represents a possible tool of control during events involving excited groups of people."
https://openalex.org/W2089785158,"Retinoids are chromophores involved in vision, transcriptional regulation, and cellular differentiation. Members of the short chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily catalyze the transformation of retinol to retinal. Here, we describe the identification and properties of three enzymes from a novel subfamily of four retinol dehydrogenases (RDH11–14) that display dual-substrate specificity, uniquely metabolizing all-trans- andcis-retinols with C15 pro-Rspecificity. RDH11–14 could be involved in the first step of all-trans- and 9-cis-retinoic acid production in many tissues. RDH11–14 fill the gap in our understanding of 11-cis-retinal and all-trans-retinal transformations in photoreceptor (RDH12) and retinal pigment epithelial cells (RDH11). The dual-substrate specificity of RDH11 explains the minor phenotype associated with mutations in 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (RDH5) causing fundus albipunctatus in humans and engineered mice lacking RDH5. Furthermore, photoreceptor RDH12 could be involved in the production of 11-cis-retinal from 11-cis-retinol during regeneration of the cone visual pigments. These newly identified enzymes add new elements to important retinoid metabolic pathways that have not been explained by previous genetic and biochemical studies.

These newly identified enzymes add new elements to important retinoid metabolic pathways that have not been explained by previous genetic and biochemical studies. Retinoids are indispensable light-sensitive elements of vision and also serve as essential modulators of cellular differentiation and proliferation in diverse cell types, including those comprising the epithelium and immune system. Retinoids modulate the growth of both normal and malignant cells through their binding to retinoid receptors. All-trans-retinoic acid signals through specific interactions with the nuclear retinoic acid receptors, whereas its isomer, 9-cis-retinoic acid, is a high affinity ligand of retinoic acid receptors and retinoid X receptors. In the retina, light-dependent photoisomerization of 11-cis-retinylidene to the all-trans-retinylidene moiety of rod and cone photoreceptors is a key reaction that triggers visual sensation (1Polans A. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 547-554Google Scholar). Restoration of the visual chromophore occurs through a complex set of reactions, termed the retinoid cycle, in photoreceptor cells and adjacent retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) 1The abbreviations used are: RPE, retinal pigment epithelial (cells); SDR, short chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase; RDH, retinol dehydrogenase; prRDH, photoreceptor RDH; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; DTT, dithiothreitol; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; EST, expressed sequence tag; kb, kilobases; ROS, rod outer segments; BTP, 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino] propane. (2McBee J.K. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Pepperberg D.R. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 469-529Google Scholar). Dietary deficiencies in retinoids and retinoid precursors cause visual impairment, developmental abnormalities, and immune deficiency (3Leid M. Kastner P. Chambon P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 427-433Google Scholar,4Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Google Scholar). Transformations of retinoids occur mostly through enzymatic or photochemical reactions, although they readily isomerize non-enzymatically to thermodynamic equilibrium when unprotected by the retinoid-binding proteins (5McBee J.K. Van Hooser J.P. Jang G.F. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48483-48493Google Scholar). The key enzymes involved in retinoid metabolisms are alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases that convert retinols to aldehydes and aldehydes to carboxylic acids, respectively. The first oxidation reaction is catalyzed by a large number of enzymes from the SDR superfamily (6Napoli J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 139-162Google Scholar, 7Jornvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Google Scholar) and by classic medium chain alcohol dehydrogenases (8Chou C.F. Lai C.L. Chang Y.C. Duester G. Yin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25209-25216Google Scholar). SDRs are weakly conserved in their primary sequences, with the exception of key residues involved in catalysis, nucleotide recognition, and members of closely related subfamilies. SDRs also display NADP or NAD cofactor preference and, if they are retinol dehydrogenases (RDHs), favor all-trans- orcis-retinol substrates. Some RDH enzymes also catalyze the oxidation of steroids in addition to retinols (9Biswas M.G. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15959-15966Google Scholar). Localized expression of these enzymes in the photoreceptor and RPE cells, where heavy traffic of diffusible retinoids occurs, strongly suggest that retinols and retinals are their in vivo substrates. The role of specific SDRs in vision has been determined from the biochemical characterization of enzymes isolated from specific compartments of the retina, analyses of retinoid flow in genetically engineered mice, and from associations of human visual dysfunctions with specific disabling mutations in one of the SDR genes, RDH5 (for review, see Ref. 2McBee J.K. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Pepperberg D.R. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 469-529Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to resolve the discrepancy between biochemical and genetic analyses of the RDH activity responsible for 11-cis-retinal and 9-cis-retinal production. An enzyme encoded by the RDH5 gene (10Driessen C.A. Janssen B.P. Winkens H.J. van Vugt A.H. de Leeuw T.L. Janssen J.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 1988-1996Google Scholar, 11Simon A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1107-1112Google Scholar), 11-cis-RDH, was proposed to be responsible for both 11-cis-retinal and 9-cis-retinal production due to its relaxed substrate specificity (12Paik J. Vogel S. Piantedosi R. Sykes A. Blaner W.S. Swisshelm K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8073-8084Google Scholar, 13Mertz J.R. Shang E. Piantedosi R. Wei S. Wolgemuth D.J. Blaner W.S. J. Biol.

Kuhlmann E.D. Janssen A.P. van Vugt A.H. Deutman A.F. Janssen J.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 135-140Google Scholar). However, the disruption of this gene in a mouse model led to uninterrupted production of 11-cis-retinal (16Jang G.F. Van Hooser J.P. Kuksa V. McBee J.K. He Y.G. Janssen J.J. Driessen C.A. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32456-32465Google Scholar, 17Driessen C.A. Winkens H.J. Hoffmann K. Kuhlmann L.D. Janssen B.P. Van Vugt A.H. Van Hooser J.P. Wieringa B.E. Deutman A.F. Palczewski K. Ruether K. Janssen J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4275-4287Google Scholar) and a lack of any embryonic abnormalities. Furthermore, patients with fundus albipunctatus who also have a disabling mutation in the RDH5 gene still show efficient production of the chromophore, albeit with slower kinetics (18Yamamoto H. Simon A. Eriksson U. Harris E. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 188-191Google Scholar, 19Cideciyan A.V. Haeseleer F. Fariss R.N. Aleman T.S. Jang G.F. Verlinde C.L. Marmor M.F. Jacobson S.G. Palczewski K. Visual Neurosci. 2000; 17: 667-678Google Scholar). Here, we characterized members of a novel subfamily of SDRs cloned from the retina that display novel properties of dualcis- and all-trans-retinol substrate specificities. The recognition of both types of isomers studied by stereospecific substrates unravels a novel mode of substrate recognition. The RDH11 transcript has been previously identified as one that exhibits increased expression on exposure to androgens in the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line (20Lin B. White J.T. Ferguson C. Wang S. Vessella R. Bumgarner R. True L.D. Hood L. Nelson P.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1611-1618Google Scholar) and is proposed to be involved in the metabolism of retinoids (21Kedishvili N.Y. Chumakova O.V. Chetyrkin S.V. Belyaeva O.V. Lapshina E.A. Lin D.W. Matsumura M. Nelson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28909-28915Google Scholar). Full-length RDHs were amplified by PCR from human (RDH11–13) or mouse (RDH14) retina cDNA libraries using primers FH497 (5′-GAGATGGTTGAGCTCATGTTC-3′) and FH498 (5′-GTTAGTCTATTGGGAGGCC3-′) for RDH11, FH500 (5′-acgatgctggtcaccttgggactg-3′) and FH501 (5′-ACGATGCTGGTCACCTTGGGACTG-3′) for RDH12, FH502 (5′-ATGAGCCGCTACCTGCTGCCG-3′) and FH503 (5′-TTATCTGGGGAGGGGCTGCTC-3′) for RDH13, and FH490 (5′-GTTATGGCAGTGGCTAGTGTGG-3′) and FH491 (5′-CTATTTTAGAATGCCAACCATCACTT-3′) for RDH14. The reactions were cycled through 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 2.5 min followed by 7 min at 68 °C. The PCR products were cloned in the pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced by dideoxyterminator sequencing (ABI-Prism, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The coding sequences for RDH12 and RDH14 were cloned as a fragment intoBamHI-XhoI or EcoRI-XbaI sites in pMAL-c2X (New England Biolabs). This joins RDH12 and RDH14 in fusion with the maltose-binding protein. RDH12 and RDH14 were expressed in TOP10 bacteria after induction with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and purified on an amylose column according to the manufacturer's protocol. The coding sequence for RDH13 was cloned into EcoRI-digested pET30A. This fusion construct joins RDH13 to a His6 tag. RDH13 was expressed in BL21 bacteria after induction with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and purified on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column in denaturing conditions according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). The coding sequence of human RDH11, human RDH12, human RDH13, or mouse RDH14 was transferred as aNotI-KpnI fragment inNotI-KpnI-digested pFASTBac. Recombinant RDH baculoviruses were then obtained by transposition in DH10BAC bacteria and amplified after transfection in SF9 cells. The expression of recombinant proteins was tested 3 days after transfection, and the cells were collected for enzymatic assays. ARPE19 cells were transfected with baculoviruses, and expression was driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter as described previously (22Haeseleer F. Imanishi Y. Saperstein D.A. Palczewski K. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3294-3300Google Scholar). The in situ hybridization techniques and preparation of the mouse, bovine, human and monkey retinal sections were carried out as described previously (23Imanishi Y. Li N. Sokal I. Sowa M.E. Lichtarge O. Wensel T.G. Saperstein D.A. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 15: 63-78Google Scholar). cDNA fragments of mouse and human RDH12 were cloned into PCRII-TOPO vectors and linearized with appropriate endonucleases. Antisense and sense RNA probes (0.9–1 kb) were synthesized by run-off transcription from the SP6 or T7 promoter with digoxigenin-UTP, as recommended in the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For immunohistochemistry, retinal sections were blocked for nonspecific labeling by incubating in 1.5% normal goat serum in PBST buffer (136 mm NaCl, 11.4 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) for 15 min at room temperature. Sections were incubated with purified anti-RDH11 monoclonal antibody or anti-RDH13 serum overnight at 4 °C. Controls were prepared by absorbing the antibodies with an excess amount of RDH11 peptide (0.5 μg/ml) or purified RDH13 (2 μg/ml). Sections were rinsed in PBST and incubated with indocarbocyanine (Cy3)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Sections were then rinsed in PBST and mounted in 50 μl of 2% 1,4-diazabicyclo-2,2,2-octane in 90% glycerol to slow photobleaching. Sections were analyzed under a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM510). Bright field images were captured with Nomarski optics (NIKON). The antibody against RDH11 was generated against CHVAWVSVQARNETIAR-CONH2 peptide (21Kedishvili N.Y. Chumakova O.V. Chetyrkin S.V. Belyaeva O.V. Lapshina E.A. Lin D.W. Matsumura M. Nelson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28909-28915Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed and purified RDH13 and RDH14 were used to immunize BALB/c mice to obtain anti-RDH13/14 antisera. Mouse anti-RDH5 monoclonal antibodies were raised against RDH5-His6 purified from RDH5-His6-infected Sf9 cells (24Jang G.F. McBee J.K. Alekseev A.M. Haeseleer F. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28128-28138Google Scholar). All reactions involving retinoids were carried out under dim-red light conditions. Retinoids were stored inN,N-dimethylformamide under argon at −80 °C. Retinoids were purified by normal phase HPLC (Beckman Instruments, Ultrasphere-Si, 4.6 mm × 250 mm) with 10% ethyl acetate, 90% hexane at a flow rate of 1.4 ml/min using an HP1100 with an on-line diode-array detector and HP Chemstation A.06.03 software. Fresh bovine eyes were obtained from a local slaughterhouse (Schenk Packing Co., Inc., Stanwood, WA). ROS membranes were isolated from bovine retina using the sucrose gradient centrifugation method (25Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-52Google Scholar). RPE microsomes were prepared as described previously (26Stecher H. Gelb M.H. Saari J.C. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8577-8585Google Scholar). Expression of RDH5 with a His6tag at the carboxyl terminus in Sf9 cells was reported previously (24Jang G.F. McBee J.K. Alekseev A.M. Haeseleer F. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28128-28138Google Scholar). Horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (Sigma/Aldrich) was purified on a Mono Q HR5/5 (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with 10 mm BTP, pH 7.3, using a linear gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl over 60 min at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. The horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase fraction (eluted at 1–3 min, 0.6 mg/ml) containing the highest dehydrogenase activity when assayed with pro-R [4-3H]NADH, and all-trans-retinal or 11-cis-retinal was used in further studies (24Jang G.F. McBee J.K. Alekseev A.M. Haeseleer F. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28128-28138Google Scholar). l-Glutamic dehydrogenase (Sigma/Aldrich) was dialyzed against 10 mm BTP, pH 7.3, 0.1m NaCl before use. The preparation of pro-R[4-3H]NADH was accomplished by utilizing the pro-R-specific enzyme yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (Sigma) to reduce NAD with 1-3H-labeled EtOH (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.) as previously described (16Jang G.F. Van Hooser J.P. Kuksa V. McBee J.K. He Y.G. Janssen J.J. Driessen C.A. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32456-32465Google Scholar). Syntheses of pro-S [4-3H]NADH and pro-S[4-3H]NADPH were carried out with l-glutamic dehydrogenase (Sigma), NAD(P) (Sigma), andl-[2,3-3H]glutamic acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as previously described (19Cideciyan A.V. Haeseleer F. Fariss R.N. Aleman T.S. Jang G.F. Verlinde C.L. Marmor M.F. Jacobson S.G. Palczewski K. Visual Neurosci. 2000; 17: 667-678Google Scholar). Synthesis of pro-R[4-3H]NADPH was prepared with l-glutamic dehydrogenase, [4-3H]NADP, and l-glutamic acid, as described previously (24Jang G.F. McBee J.K. Alekseev A.M. Haeseleer F. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28128-28138Google Scholar). The product was purified on a Mono Q HR 5/5 column equilibrated with 10 mm BTP, pH 7.3, using a linear gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl over 60 min at a flow rate of 0.7–1 ml/min. Concentrations of NADH and NADPH (pH 7.4) were determined using ε = 6,220 at 340 nm, and concentrations of NAD and NADP (pH 7.4) were determined using ε = 18,000 at 260 nm (27Mercer E.I. Scott T.A. Concise Encyclopedia of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1997Google Scholar). Pro-R,S-9-cis-[15-3H]retinol, pro-R,S-11-cis-[15-3H]retinol, and pro-R,S-all-trans-[15-3H]retinol were prepared by the reduction of their respective retinals with [3H]NaBH4 (PerkinElmer) as described before (24Jang G.F. McBee J.K. Alekseev A.M. Haeseleer F. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28128-28138Google Scholar). [15-3H]Retinal was synthesized by MnO2oxidation of the corresponding pro-R,S-[15-3H]retinol as previously described (24Jang G.F. McBee J.K. Alekseev A.M. Haeseleer F. Palczewski K. J. Biol.

Table I summarizes the syntheses of various stereospecific 15-3H-labeled retinols by different dehydrogenases. pro-R and pro-Sdesignations were used for 15-3H-labeled retinols produced by the enzyme for which the stereospecificity is known (24Jang G.F.

RPE microsomes (1.3 ml, 5 mg/ml) were solubilized with 5 mm n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside in the presence of 20 mm BTP, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, and 1 μm leupeptin (buffer A) with 20 μmNAD and NADP for 60 min on ice. The solubilized mixtures were centrifuged at 71,700 × g for 40 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto the monoclonal anti-RDH5 antibodies Sepharose 4B (∼0.6 ml of gel) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was then washed with 12 ml of the same buffer, RDH5 was eluted by 45 mm sodium citrate, pH 3.0, 5 mm n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and 1 mmDTT, and the fraction was immediately neutralized with 1.35m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, to ∼pH 6–7. The purification of RDH5-His6 from the transfected Sf9 cells (∼1.5 ml of cell pellets) was carried out similarly except using solubilization buffer at a final volume of 6 ml and 1 ml of gel. Sepharose-antibody-bound RDH activities and substrate specificities were carried out by monitoring the production of [15-3H]retinol (reduction of retinal) (24Jang G.F. McBee J.K. Alekseev A.M. Haeseleer F. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28128-28138Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (150 μl) contained MES (final concentration, 70–74 mm, pH 5.5), DTT (1 mm), pro-S[4-3H]NADH (26 μm), or pro-S[4-3H]NADPH (26 μm), 20–25 μl of Sepharose-antibody-bound RDH gel suspension (suspended in 2× volumes of buffer A) in the presence or absence of NAD(P)H (520 μm), and 2 μl of retinal (120–140 μm) substrate stock was added last to initiate the reaction. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 50 min then terminated with 400 μl of methanol and 100 μl of 1 m NaCl and extracted with 500 μl of hexane. Radioactivity was measured in the organic phase by scintillation counting. Initial screening of prostate short chain dehydrogenase/reductase I (PSDR1) expression, an enzyme cloned by Nelson and co-workers (20Lin B. White J.T. Ferguson C. Wang S. Vessella R. Bumgarner R. True L.D. Hood L. Nelson P.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1611-1618Google Scholar) from prostate epithelium, reveals that this enzyme is also expressed in the eye (data not shown). Therefore, the name PSDR1 was changed into RDH11 to reflect its broader expression. Nucleic acid and protein sequence databases were searched with the RDH11 cDNA sequence (identical to the sequence of the PSDR1 gene product (20Lin B. White J.T. Ferguson C. Wang S. Vessella R. Bumgarner R. True L.D. Hood L. Nelson P.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1611-1618Google Scholar)) using Blast. This search identified full-length cDNA clones that show homology to RDH11 and encode RDH12 (first deposited by T. Isogai and under accession number AK054835), RDH13 (expressed sequence tag (EST) deposited by R. Strausberg and under accession number BE736147), and RDH14 (also named PAN2 and deposited by Z. Krozowski under accession number AF237952). The analysis of these cDNAs shows open reading frames of 316, 331, and 336 amino acids for RDH12, RDH13, and RDH14, respectively, encoding proteins of ∼35, ∼36, and ∼37 kDa. RDH11 shares 79% similarity with RDH12 and ∼60% similarity with RDH13 and RDH14. RDH12, RDH13, and RDH14 share ∼60% similarity among themselves (Fig.1, A and B). These proteins contain two motifs highly conserved among SDRs, the cofactor-binding site (GXXXGXG) and catalytic residues (YXXXK). SDRs contain a motif at the amino terminus consisting of β-strand A, α-helix B, β-strand B, and α-helix C (part of the βA-αB-βB-αC-βC-αD-βD that forms the Rossman fold), which interacts with the adenosine monophosphate moiety of the cofactor. The residues present at the junctions βA-αB and βB-αC are thought to be important in selectivity for NAD(H) versusNADP(H). For favorable interaction with NADP(H), positively charged residues are present at the βA-αB junction (glycine-rich motif) and/or at the beginning of α-helix C (7Jornvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Google Scholar). For all RDH11–14, no charged amino acids are present in the Gly-rich motif (GANTGIG for RDH11–13 or GANSGLG for RDH14), and there are positively charged residues present at the βB-αC junction (RDVEK, RDVLK, RDMEK, RDRARA for RDH11, -12, -13, and -14, respectively), suggesting a preference for NADP/NADPH (Fig. 1 A). The tissue distribution of RDH11–14 was deduced from the array of ESTs displayed in databases corresponding to these RDHs. RDH11 was reported to be expressed abundantly in prostate tissue but also in eye, kidney, pancreas, liver, testis, heart, and brain (20Lin B. White J.T. Ferguson C. Wang S. Vessella R. Bumgarner R. True L.D. Hood L. Nelson P.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1611-1618Google Scholar). In addition, ESTs corresponding to RDH11 were also found in libraries from eye, skin, and muscle. ESTs matching RDH12 were identified in multiple tissues, most of them from eye, but also some from kidney, brain, skeletal muscle, and stomach. RDH13 ESTs were obtained mostly from eye, pancreas, placenta, and lung. Many ESTs from brain, kidney, pancreas, and placenta correspond to RDH14. Genomic clones were identified by GenBankTM data base searches with the coding sequences of the RDHs. Clone Hs14_10185 contains both entire human RDH11 andRDH12 genes. The RDH11 gene is located ∼30 kb from the RDH12 gene in the 3′-RDH11-5′ 5′-RDH12-3′ orientation. This genomic clone originates from chromosome 14 at q23.3. These genes are located at the locus for a recessive blinding disease, Leber's congenital amaurosis 3 (LCA3) (www.sph.uth.tmc.edu/Retnet). Clone AC011476.7, obtained from chromosome 19 at q13.42, contains the complete RDH13 gene. Clone Hs2_16082 contains the RDH14 gene and originates from chromosome 2 at p24.1. Comparison of the RDH cDNAs with these genomic clones solved the gene structures. The gene structures ofRDH11, RDH12, and RDH13 are almost identical and are interrupted by six introns. The intron/exon junctions of RDH11 and RDH12 are at the same positions, whereas intron 6 of RDH13 is positioned 35 amino acids upstream compared with intron 6 of RDH11 andRDH12. RDH14 has only one intron, which is located at the same position as intron 3 of RDH11,RDH12, and RDH13, and is a relatively small gene (∼6 kb compared with 13–18 kb for the RDH11-13) (Fig.1 C). This gene structure is different from other SDR superfamily RDHs expressed in the eye (30Romert A. Tuvendal P. Tryggvason K. Dencker L. Eriksson U. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 338-345Google Scholar, 31Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11034-11043Google Scholar, 32Haeseleer F. Palczewski K. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 372-383Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody specific for RDH11 did not cross-react with RDH5, a prominent enzyme present in the RPE as shown by immunoblotting (Fig.2 A). The lack of cross-reactivity is apparent because RDH5 and RDH11 have different molecular masses. Strong immunoreactivity was detected in bovine and monkey RPE (Fig. 2, C and F) and was blocked by RDH11 peptides (Fig. 2, D and G). A lower level of RDH11 expression was also detected in the Müller cells, as demonstrated by a double immunolabeling study with the Müller cell marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (Fig. 2 H). A digoxigenin-conjugated RDH12 antisense RNA probe hybridized to the base of monkey photoreceptor inner segments (Fig.3, A and B,left). To visualize the chromogenic signal in RPE cells, an albino mouse retina was examined in this study (Fig. 3 B). In albino mouse (BALB/c) retina (Fig. 3 B, left), signals were not observed in the RPE cell layer. As a negative control, the sense RDH12 RNA probe did not produce significant hybridization signals in monkey or mouse retina (Fig. 3, A andB, right). No specific anti-RDH12 antibodies have been generated so far. Antibodies recognizing RDH13 (Fig.4 A) labeled inner segments of the photoreceptor cells of human and monkey retina (Fig. 4,C and F). Weak signals were observed in a small population of inner nuclear neurons and the inner plexiform layer. Higher magnification images localized RDH13 expression to inner segments of rod and cone photoreceptors (Fig. 4 H,inset). This immunoreactivity is specific as it was blocked by purified RDH13 protein. RDH14 yielded hybridization signals in the photoreceptor nuclear layer, and this enzyme appears to be expressed at low levels in the eye, although RDH14 immunolabeling was clearly observed in the bovine cone and ROS with a weaker signal in Müller cells (Supplemental Fig. 1). RDH11 catalyzed the reduction of all-trans-retinal and its 9-cis-, 11-cis-, and 13-cis-retinal isomers. The activity was observed in the presence of NADPH and with Sf9 insect cell membranes only when Sf9 cells were transfected with the cDNA encoding RDH11 (Fig. 5). The products were clearly identified by the characteristic spectrum for each retinol isomer and a retention time that was similar to authentic standards (Fig. 5). This analysis avoids"
https://openalex.org/W2062921699,"The Rel/NF-kappaB transcription factors play a key role in the regulation of apoptosis and in tumorigenesis by controlling the expressions of specific genes. To determine the role of the constitutive activity of RelA in tumorigenesis, we generated pancreatic tumor cell lines that express a dominant negative mutant of IkappaBalpha (IkappaBalphaM). In this report, we show that the inhibition of constitutive NF-kappaB activity, either by ectopic expression of IkappaBalphaM or by treating the cells with a proteasome inhibitor PS-341 which blocks intracellular degradation of IkappaBalpha proteins, downregulates the expression of bcl-xl. We identified two putative NF-kappaB binding sites (kappaB/A and B) in the bcl-xl promoter and found that these two sites interact with different NF-kappaB proteins. p65/p50 heterodimer interacts with kappaB/A site whereas p50/p50 homodimer interacts with kappaB/B. The bcl-xl promoter reporter gene assays reveal that NF-kappaB dependent transcriptional activation is mainly mediated by kappaB/A site, indicating that bcl-xl is one of the downstream target genes regulated by RelA/p50. Both IkappaBalphaM and PS-341 completely abolish NF-kappaB DNA binding activity; however, PS-341, but not ectopic expression of IkappaBalphaM, sensitized cells to apoptosis induced by Taxol. This is due to the Taxol-mediated reactivation of RelA through phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBbeta and the re-expression of NF-kappaB regulated bcl-xl gene in these cancer cells as ectopic expression of the bcl-xl gene confers resistance to Taxol-induced apoptosis in PS-341 sensitized cells. These results demonstrate the important function of various NF-kappaB/IkappaB complexes in regulating anti-apoptotic genes in response to apoptotic stimuli, and they raise the possibility that NF-kappaB : IkappaBalpha and NF-kappaB : IkappaBbeta complexes are regulated by different upstream activators, and that NF-kappaB plays a key role in pancreatic tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2314361118,"The hSNF5/INI1 gene encodes a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complexes. It was recently identified as a tumour suppressor gene mutated in sporadic and hereditary Malignant Rhabdoid Tumours (MRT). However, the role of hSNF5/INI1 loss-of-function in tumour development is still unknown. Here, we show that the ectopic expression of wild-type hSNF5/INI1, but not that of truncated versions, leads to a cell cycle arrest by inhibiting the entry into S phase of MRT cells. This G1 arrest is associated with down-regulation of a subset of E2F targets including cyclin A, E2F1 and CDC6. This arrest can be reverted by coexpression of cyclin D1, cyclin E or viral E1A, whereas it cannot be counteracted by pRB-binding deficient E1A mutants. Moreover, hSNF5/INI1 is not able to arrest cells lacking a functional pRB. These observations suggest that the hSNF5/INI1-induced G1 arrest is dependent upon the presence of a functional pRB. However, the observation that a constitutively active pRB can efficiently arrest MRT cells indicates that hSNF5/INI1, at the difference of the ATPase subunits of the SWI/SNF complex, is dispensable for pRB function. Altogether, these data show that hSNF5/INI1 is a potent regulator of the entry into S phase, an effect that may account for its tumour suppressor role."
https://openalex.org/W2036876659,"The novel phase II antitumor polynuclear platinum drug BBR3464 ([(trans-PtCl(NH3)2)2(μ-trans-Pt(NH3)2(NH2(CH2)6NH2)2)](NO3)4) forms intra- and interstrand cross-links (CLs) on DNA (which is the pharmacological target of platinum drugs). We examined first in our recent work how various intrastrand CLs of BBR3464 affect the conformation of DNA and its recognition by cellular components (Zehnulova, J., Kasparkova, J., Farrell, N., and Brabec, V. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 22191–22199). In the present work, we have extended the studies on the DNA interstrand CLs of this drug. The results have revealed that the interstrand CLs are preferentially formed between guanine residues separated by 2 base pairs in both the 3′ → 3′ and 5′ → 5′ directions. The major 1,4-interstrand CLs distort DNA, inducing a directional bending of the helix axis and local unwinding of the duplex. Although such distortions represent a potential structural motif for recognition by high mobility group proteins, these proteins do not recognize 1,4-interstrand CLs of BBR3464. On the other hand, in contrast to intrastrand adducts of BBR3464, 1,4-interstrand CLs are not removed from DNA by nucleotide excision repair. It has been suggested that interstrand CLs of BBR3464 could persist considerably longer in cells compared with intrastrand adducts, which would potentiate the toxicity of the interstrand lesions to tumors sensitive to this polynuclear drug.

It has been suggested that interstrand CLs of BBR3464 could persist considerably longer in cells compared with intrastrand adducts, which would potentiate the toxicity of the interstrand lesions to tumors sensitive to this polynuclear drug. It is now well established that polynuclear platinum compounds in which two or three platinum coordination units are linked in a linear fashion compose an important new class of anticancer drugs [1,2]. The first clinical compound, currently denoted BBR3464 (see Fig. 1A), is a bifunctional trinuclear DNA-binding agent with an overall 4+ charge (3Manzotti C. Pratesi G. Menta E. Di Domenico R. Cavalletti E. Fiebig H.H. Kelland L.R. Farrell N. Polizzi D. Supino R. Pezzoni G. Zunino F. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 2626-2634Google Scholar). The phase I trials (4Calvert P.M. Highley M.S.

Objective responses in phase II were verified in relapsed ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (6.Calvert, A. H., Thomas, H., Colombo, N., Gore, M., Earl, H., Sena, L., Camboni, G., Liati, P., and Sessa, C.

Pre-clinical studies indicated activity in p53 mutant tumors and a minimum induction of p53 following BBR3464 treatment. The interactions of antitumor polynuclear platinum compounds with target DNA (for reviews, see Refs. 1Farrell N. Qu Y. Bierbach U. Valsecchi M. Menta E. Lippert B. Cisplatin: Chemistry and Biochemistry of a Leading Anticancer Drug. VCH Publishers, Zurich1999: 479-496Google Scholar, 2Farrell N. Kelland L.R. Farrell N.P. Platinum-based Drugs in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 321-338Google Scholar, and 8Brabec V. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 1-68Google Scholar) are distinct from those of the mononuclear based cisplatin family and, indeed, unlike those of any DNA-damaging agent in clinical use. Hence, it is important to understand these novel interactions to the greatest extent possible and how they affect DNA structure and function to exploit the full clinical potential of these new agents. Bifunctional binding of BBR3464 to double-stranded DNA preferentially involves guanine residues and is characterized by the rapid formation of long-range intra- and interstrand cross-links (CLs) 1The abbreviations used are: CLs, cross-links; HMG, high mobility group; NER, nucleotide excision repair; HMGB1a, HMGB1 domain A; HMGB1b, HMGB1 domain B; RPA, replication protein A; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; DEPC, diethyl pyrocarbonate; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; CFE, cell-free extract. in which the platinated sites are separated by 1 or more bp (9Brabec V. Kasparkova J. Vrana O. Novakova O. Cox J.W. Qu Y. Farrell N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6781-6790Google Scholar). Quantitation of DNA interstrand cross-linking in natural and linear DNAs indicated ∼20% of the DNA to be interstrand cross-linked. This value is significantly higher than that for cisplatin (10Brabec V. Leng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5345-5349Google Scholar, 11Vrana O. Boudny V. Brabec V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3918-3925Google Scholar); on the other hand, an intriguing aspect of BBR3464 is that long-range delocalized intrastrand adducts are equally or even more probable than interstrand CLs (9Brabec V. Kasparkova J. Vrana O. Novakova O. Cox J.W. Qu Y. Farrell N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6781-6790Google Scholar). As the [Pt,Pt] intrastrand CLs of BBR3464 are analogs of the major adducts of cisplatin, which forms ∼90% bifunctional intrastrand adducts between neighboring purine residues on DNA, we examined first in our recent work (12Zehnulova J. Kasparkova J. Farrell N. Brabec V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22191-22199Google Scholar) how the structures of the various types of the intrastrand CLs of BBR3464 affect conformational properties of DNA and how these adducts are recognized by the HMGB1 protein and removed from DNA during in vitro nucleotide excision repair (NER) reactions. These studies were performed because some structures altered by platinum adducts, such as stable directional bending and unwinding, attract various damaged DNA-binding proteins such as those containing HMG domains (13Zlatanova J. Yaneva J. Leuba S.H. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 791-799Google Scholar, 14Ohndorf U.M. Rould M.A. He Q. Pabo C.O. Lippard S.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 708-712Google Scholar, 15Zamble D.B. Lippard S.J. Lippert B. Cisplatin: Chemistry and Biochemistry of a Leading Anticancer Drug. VHCA Publishers, Zurich1999: 73-110Google Scholar). The binding of these proteins has been postulated to mediate the antitumor properties of the platinum drugs (14Ohndorf U.M. Rould M.A. He Q. Pabo C.O. Lippard S.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 708-712Google Scholar, 15Zamble D.B. Lippard S.J. Lippert B. Cisplatin: Chemistry and Biochemistry of a Leading Anticancer Drug. VHCA Publishers, Zurich1999: 73-110Google Scholar). In addition, several reports have demonstrated that intrastrand CLs of cisplatin are removed from DNA during NER reactions and that NER is also a major mechanism contributing to cisplatin resistance (16Zamble D.B. Mu D. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10004-10013Google Scholar, 17Reardon J.T. Vaisman A. Chaney S.G. Sancar A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3968-3971Google Scholar, 18Moggs J.G. Szymkowski D.E. Yamada M. Karran P. Wood R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 480-490Google Scholar). Recent work has revealed that intrastrand CLs of BBR3464 create a local conformational distortion, but that none of these intrastrand adducts results in a stable curvature such as that observed for the major 1,2-intrastrand CL of cisplatin (12Zehnulova J. Kasparkova J. Farrell N. Brabec V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22191-22199Google Scholar). In addition, we have observed also, in contrast to the 1,2-GG intrastrand CL of cisplatin, no recognition of the intrastrand CLs of BBR3464 by HMGB1 proteins, but we have observed effective removal of these adducts from DNA by NER. We have suggested that the processing of the intrastrand CLs of BBR3464 in tumor cells sensitive to this drug may not be relevant to its antitumor effects because these CLs do not persist to potentiate the anticancer effect of this drug. This also implies that polynuclear platinum compounds apparently represent a novel class of platinum anticancer drugs acting by a different mechanism than cisplatin and its analogs. On the other hand, BBR3464 also forms interstrand CLs on DNA with a considerably higher frequency compared with cisplatin (9Brabec V. Kasparkova J. Vrana O. Novakova O. Cox J.W. Qu Y. Farrell N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6781-6790Google Scholar). In general, DNA interstrand CLs could be even more effective lesions than intrastrand adducts in terminating DNA or RNA synthesis in tumor cells and thus could be even more likely candidates for the genotoxic lesion relevant to the antitumor effects of BBR3464. In addition, the interstrand CLs pose a special challenge to repair enzymes because they involve both strands of DNA and would not be repaired so readily as intrastrand lesions because these repair enzymes would require the information in the complementary strand for resynthesis. In this way, the interstrand CLs might persist considerably longer than intrastrand adducts, which would result in a higher cytotoxicity of the interstrand lesions. Interestingly, the interstrand CLs formed by cisplatin, which still remain important candidates for a genotoxic lesion relevant to the antitumor effects of this platinum drug, preferentially form between guanine residues in the 5′-GC/5′-GC sequence. This adduct induces several irregularities in DNA (19Huang H.F. Zhu L.M. Reid B.R. Drobny G.P. Hopkins P.B. Science. 1995; 270: 1842-1845Google Scholar, 20Coste F. Malinge J.M. Serre L. Shepard W. Roth M. Leng M. Zelwer C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1837-1846Google Scholar, 21Brabec V. Kelland L.R. Farrell N.P. Platinum-based Drugs in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 37-61Google Scholar). The guanine residues interstrand cross-linked by cisplatin are not paired with hydrogen bonds to the complementary cytosines, which are located outside the duplex and not stacked with other aromatic rings. All other base residues are paired, but distortion extends over at least 4 bp at the site of the CL. In addition, the cis-diammineplatinum(II) bridge resides in the minor groove, and the double helix is locally reversed to a left-handed, Z-DNA-like form. This adduct induces the helix unwinding by 76–80° relative to B-DNA and also the bending of 20–40° of the helix axis at the cross-linked site toward the minor groove. In addition, the interstrand CL of cisplatin is specifically recognized by the full-length HMGB1 protein (22Kasparkova J. Brabec V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12379-12387Google Scholar) and its domain B 2J. Kasparkova, O. Delalande, M. Stros, M. Vojtiskova, J. Kozelka, and V. Brabec, submitted for publication. and is not removed by the NER system under conditions in which the 1,2-GG intrastrand CL is readily excised (16Zamble D.B. Mu D. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10004-10013Google Scholar). Cellular pharmacology studies in L1210 and osteosarcoma cells using alkaline elution show the persistence of interstrand CLs with time, consistent with a slower rate of repair (23Roberts J.D. Peroutka J. Farrell N. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1999; 77: 51-57Google Scholar, 24Perego P. Gatti L. Caserini C. Supino R. Colangelo D. Leone R. Spinelli S. Farrell N. Zunino F. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1999; 77: 59-64Google Scholar). Hence, data on conformation, recognition by HMGB1 domain proteins, and NER of DNA interstrand CLs of BBR3464 are needed to obtain greater insight into which DNA adduct of BBR3464 is the more likely lesion responsible for the antitumor effects of this polynuclear platinum drug. In this work, we continue our investigations of the DNA interactions of BBR3464 in cell-free medium to address further fundamental questions about the mechanism of antitumor activity of this novel platinum drug. In a previous report (9Brabec V. Kasparkova J. Vrana O. Novakova O. Cox J.W. Qu Y. Farrell N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6781-6790Google Scholar) using an indirect assay employing transcription mapping of the DNA fragment globally modified by BBR3464, some sites in DNA involved in the interstrand CLs have been already suggested. However, no systematic study on the sequence specificity of these lesions has been performed. Therefore, in this work, we examined in detail which sites are preferentially involved in the interstrand CLs of BBR3464. In addition, we also studied how interstrand CLs of BBR3464 affect the local conformation of DNA (in particular, bending and unwinding) and how these adducts are recognized by the HMGB1 domain proteins and removed from DNA during in vitro NER reactions. BBR3464 (see Fig. 1A) was prepared by standard methods. Cisplatin (see Fig. 1A), dimethyl sulfate (DMS), KMnO4, diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC), KBr, and KHSO5 were obtained from Sigma (Prague, Czech Republic). The stock solutions of platinum compounds were prepared at a concentration of 5 × 10−4m in 10 mm NaClO4 and stored at 4 °C in the dark. The synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides (see Fig. 1B) were synthesized and purified as described previously (25Brabec V. Reedijk J. Leng M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12397-12402Google Scholar). Expression and purification of rat recombinant full-length HMGB1 protein and its domains A (residues 1–84) and B (residues 85–180) (HMGB1a and HMGB1b, respectively) were carried out as described (26Stros M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10355-10361Google Scholar, 27Stros M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4769-4779Google Scholar). Human recombinant replication protein A (RPA) was purified from Escherichia coli (28Hermanson-Miller I.L. Turchi J.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2402-2408Google Scholar) and was a kind gift of John J. Turchi. T4 DNA ligase and T4 polynucleotide kinase were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). Acrylamide, bisacrylamide, urea and NaCN were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). [γ-32P]ATP was fromAmersham Biosciences. ATP was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). The single-stranded oligonucleotides (the top strands of the duplexes in Fig. 1B, except [TGGT] and [GTG(NER)]) were reacted in stoichiometric amounts with the monoaqua derivative of BBR3464. The platinated oligonucleotides were re-purified by ion-exchange fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). We verified that the modified oligonucleotides contained three platinum atoms by platinum flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry and by measurement of the optical density. Using DMS footprinting of platinum on DNA (10Brabec V. Leng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5345-5349Google Scholar, 29Comess K.M. Costello C.E. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2102-2110Google Scholar, 30Lemaire M.A. Schwartz A. Rahmouni A.R. Leng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1982-1985Google Scholar), we also verified that in the platinated top strands of all duplexes, N-7 of a single guanine (G) residue was not accessible for reaction with DMS. The oligonucleotides were then treated with hot piperidine and analyzed by denaturing 24% PAGE. For the unmodified oligonucleotides, shortened fragments due to cleavage of the strand at one methylated G residue were observed on the gel. However, no such bands were detected for the oligonucleotides modified by BBR3464. These results indicate that one BBR3464 molecule was coordinated to a single G residue in the top strands of all duplexes. The platinated top strands were allowed to anneal with unplatinated complementary strands (the bottom strands in Fig. 1B) in 0.1 mNaClO4. The resulting products were analyzed by FPLC in an alkaline gradient. Using this denaturing gradient, non-interstrand cross-linked strands were eluted as a 20–23-nucleotide single strand, whereas the interstrand cross-linked strands were eluted later in a single peak as a higher molecular mass species. Only this single peak was collected so that the samples of the interstrand cross-linked duplexes contained no single-stranded molecules. Alternatively, the products were separated on denaturing 8 m urea and 12% polyacrylamide gel; the bands corresponding to interstrand cross-linked duplexes were analyzed by densitometry or were cut off from the gel, eluted, precipitated by ethanol, and dissolved in 50 mmNaCl. Both procedures for the purification of interstrand cross-linked duplexes provided products whose subsequent analysis (see below) gave identical results. FPLC purification and flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry measurements were carried out in an AmershamBiosciences FPLC system with a Mono Q HR 5/5 column and with a Unicam 939 AA spectrometer equipped with a graphite furnace, respectively. Duplexes [TGGT] and [GTG(NER)] (see Fig. 1B) containing a single 1,2-GG or 1,3-GTG intrastrand CL of BBR3464 or cisplatin in the top strand were prepared as described (10Brabec V. Leng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5345-5349Google Scholar, 12Zehnulova J. Kasparkova J. Farrell N. Brabec V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22191-22199Google Scholar, 29Comess K.M. Costello C.E. Lippard S.J.

The unmodified or intrastrand CLs containing duplexes used in the studies of recognition by HMGB1 domain proteins and RPA were purified by electrophoresis on native 15% polyacrylamide gel (monoacrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 29:1). Other details have been described previously (10Brabec V. Leng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5345-5349Google Scholar, 25Brabec V. Reedijk J. Leng M.

The modifications by KMnO4, DEPC, and KBr/KHSO5 were performed as described previously (33Brabec V. Sip M. Leng M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11676-11681Google Scholar, 34Bailly C. Gentle D. Hamy F. Purcell M. Waring M.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 165-173Google Scholar, 35Ross S.A. Burrows C.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 5062-5063Google Scholar, 36Bailly C. Waring M.J. Fox K.R. Drug-DNA Interaction Protocols. Humana Press Inc, Totowam, NJ1997: 51-79Google Scholar). The strands of the duplexes were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. In the case of the platinated oligonucleotides, the platinum complex was removed after reaction of the DNA with the probe by incubation with 0.2 mNaCN (pH 11) at 45 °C for 10 h in the dark. Unplatinated single strands (top strands in Fig. 1B) and the duplexes containing a unique interstrand CL were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The single-stranded, unplatinated oligonucleotides were subsequently annealed with their phosphorylated complementary strands. Unplatinated or interstrand CL-containing duplexes were allowed to react with T4 DNA ligase. The resulting samples along with ligated unplatinated duplexes were subsequently examined on native 8% polyacrylamide gel (monoacrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 29:1). Other details of these experiments were as described in previously (37Koo H.S. Wu H.M. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1986; 320: 501-506Google Scholar, 38Bellon S.F. Lippard S.J. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 35: 179-188Google Scholar, 39Kasparkova J. Novakova O. Vrana O. Farrell N. Brabec V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10997-11005Google Scholar). The 21-mer oligonucleotides (bottom strands of duplexes [1,4;3′–3′(21)] and [1,4;5′–5′(21)] shown in Fig. 1B to which one adenine residue was added to their 3′-ends and one adenine residue was removed from their 5′-ends) were 5′-end-labeled and annealed (see above) to their complementary strands (top strands of duplexes [1,4;3′–3′(21)] and [1,4;5′–5′(21)] shown in Fig. 1B), which were either unplatinated (controls) or contained monofunctional adducts of BBR3464 on the central G residue. The platinated duplexes, which had blunt ends, were further incubated for 24 h in 0.1 mNaClO4 at 37 °C to form interstrand CLs. The oligonucleotides containing interstrand CLs were separated by electrophoresis on denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel, isolated from the gel by elution, extracted by phenol/chloroform and chloroform, precipitated by ethanol, and used as DNA probes in the experiments with HMGB1a and HMGB1b proteins and RPA. The 149-bp probes with blunt ends used in the experiments with the full-length HMGB1 protein were prepared in the same way as those used in the NER assays (see below). The unplatinated and platinated duplexes (0.4 nm) were incubated with increasing concentrations of HMGB1a or HMGB1b protein in 20-μl sample volumes containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm LiCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmspermidine, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Nonidet P40. Samples were incubated on ice for 30 min and then brought to 7% in sucrose and 0.017% in xylene cyanol prior to loading on prerun and precooled (4 °C) native 6% polyacrylamide gels (monoacrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 29:1). The gels were electrophoresed for 3 h and visualized using an AmershamBiosciences PhosphorImager (Storm 860 system), and the bands were quantitated with ImageQuant software. The experiments with the full-length HMGB1 protein were performed in the same way, but with minor modifications. The labeled 149-bp DNA probes were titrated with the protein in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml sonicated calf thymus DNA in buffer composed of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mmMgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. 32P-Labeled DNA substrates (0.5 nm) and the amounts of RPA indicated were incubated at 20 °C in 20-μl reactions containing 25 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.3), 30 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.9 mm dithiothreitol, 45 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol. To assess binding at equilibrium, reactions were stopped after 30 min by cooling the samples to 0 °C. Following addition of gel loading buffer (4 μl) containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 10% glycerol, and 0.05% orange G, the extent of binding was determined on native 6% polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoresis was performed for 50 min at 4 °C; gels were dried and visualized using the Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager (Storm 860 system); and the radioactivities associated with bands were quantitated with ImageQuant software. The 149-bp substrates containing a single central 1,4-interstrand CL of BBR3464 in the 5′ → 5′ or 3′ → 3′ direction were assembled from three oligonucleotide duplexes. The central duplex was duplex [1,4;3′–3′(NER)] or [1,4;5′–5′(NER)] (shown in Fig. 1B) to which two duplexes (arms) with random base pair sequences with overhangs partially overlapping those of the interstrand cross-linked duplex were ligated (one to each side) by T4 DNA ligase. Both strands of the interstrand cross-linked central duplexes were 5′-end-labeled with 32P before ligation. The intrastrand cross-linked substrates were prepared in the similar following way. The 21-mer oligonucleotide (the top strand of duplex [GTG(NER)] shown in Fig. 1B) was used for preparation of linear 149-bp duplexes with the centrally located 1,3-GTG intrastrand CL of BBR3464 or cisplatin. Uniquely modified 21-mers were end-labeled to introduce a radiolabel at the 11th phosphodiester bond 5′ to the CL and annealed with the bottom strand of duplex [GTG(NER)]. Two duplexes (arms) with random base pair sequences with overhangs partially overlapping those of the central platinated duplex were ligated to this intrastrand cross-linked duplex (one to each side) by T4 DNA ligase. Full-length substrates (unplatinated, containing the 1,4-interstrand CL of BBR3464 or the 1,3-intrastrand CL of BBR3464 or cisplatin) were separated from unligated products on denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel, purified by electroelution, re-annealed, and stored in annealing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) at −20 °C. Other details of the purification of DNA substrates for NER were the same as described previously (40Matsunaga T. Mu D. Park C.-H. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20862-20869Google Scholar,41Buschta-Hedayat N. Buterin T. Hess M.T. Missura M. Naegeli H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6090-6095Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide excision reactions were performed in cell-free extracts (CFEs) prepared from the HeLa S3 and Chinese hamster ovary AA8 cell lines as described (17Reardon J.T. Vaisman A. Chaney S.G. Sancar A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3968-3971Google Scholar, 42Manley J.L. Fire A. Cano A. Sharp P.A. Gefter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3855-3859Google Scholar). These extracts were kindly provided by J. T. Reardon and A. Sancar (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). In vitro repair of interstrand CLs of BBR3464 was measured in an excision assay using these CFEs and 149-bp linear DNA substrates (see above) as described previously (17Reardon J.T. Vaisman A. Chaney S.G. Sancar A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3968-3971Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The reaction mixtures (25 μl) contained 10 fmol of radiolabeled DNA, 50 μg of CFE, 20 μm dATP, 20 μm dCTP, 20 μm dGTP, and 20 μm TTP in reaction buffer (23 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 44 mm KCl, 4.8 mm MgCl2, 0.16 mm EDTA, 0.52 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mm ATP, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 2.5% glycerol) and were incubated at 30 °C for 40 min. DNA was deproteinized and precipitated by ethanol. Reaction products were treated overnight with 0.4 m NaCN (pH 10–11) at 45 °C and precipitated by ethanol prior to resolution on the gels. The excision products were separated on denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gels and visualized using the Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager (Storm 860 system). We demonstrated in our previous work (9Brabec V. Kasparkova J. Vrana O. Novakova O. Cox J.W. Qu Y. Farrell N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6781-6790Google Scholar) that the preferential DNA-binding sites of BBR3464 are G residues and that along with the delocalized intrastrand CLs, the long-range interstrand CLs are the most frequent lesions produced by this drug on DNA. In these CLs, the platinated sites are separated by 1 or more base pairs. Bifunctional BBR3464 must bind to DNA first through one end of the trinuclear unit. In this first step of binding, the kinetic preferences are similar to those of mononuclear species, i.e. they coordinate preferentially to N-7 atoms of G residues. The array of adducts becomes, however, different upon the coordination of the second platinum unit (9Brabec V. Kasparkova J. Vrana O. Novakova O. Cox J.W. Qu Y. Farrell N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6781-6790Google Scholar). Considering these facts and our intention to investigate, in the present work, interstrand CLs of BBR3464, we have designed a series of synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide duplexes, [1,2], [1,4], and [1,6], whose sequences are shown in Fig. 1B. The pyrimidine-rich top strands of these duplexes contained only one G residue in the center (shown in boldface in Fig. 1B). These top strands were modified by BBR3464 so that they contained a single monofunctional adduct of this platinum complex at the central G site. The duplexes were also designed in such a way that their bottom (complementary) strands contained a G residue in different positions symmetrical to the single central cytosine (C) residue (complementary to the platinated G residue in the top strand). In this way, the G residue in the top strand with the monofunctionally attached BBR3464 may close to the 1,2-, 1,4-, or 1,6-GG interstrand CL in duplex [1,2], [1,4], or [1,6], respectively. The 1,2-interstrand CL is formed between G sites in neighboring base pairs, whereas in 1,4- and 1,6-interstrand CLs, the platinated G sites are separated by 2 and 4 base pairs, respectively. G sites in the bottom strands involved in these interstrand CLs are also shown in boldface in Fig. 1B. The nucleotide sequences of the duplexes were also designed in such a way that these interstrand CLs may close to the G residues located"

CDK5 is a kinase that phosphorylates the tau protein, and its endogenous activator, p35, regulates its activity. Recently, calpain was found to digest p35 to its truncated product, p25. Several lines of evidence suggest that p25-CDK5 has much more powerful kinase activity and that it may cause abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau. In this study, we have examined the kinetic characteristics of in vitro phosphorylation of the longest isoform of human tau by CDK5 and its activators using recombinant proteins. Although the kinase activity of CDK5 in phosphorylating tau was significantly higher in the presence of p25, the affinity of CDK5 for tau was not different. Phosphopeptide mapping revealed enhanced phosphorylation of Ser202/Thr205 residues by p25-CDK5 (amino acid residues of tau are numbered according to the longest isoform of human tau). These results suggest that cleavage of p35 to p25 greatly enhances the kinase activity of CDK5 and increases the phosphorylation of Ser202/Thr205. Considering the fact that phosphorylation of Ser202/Thr205 antagonizes the tau-mediated nucleation of tubulin, p25-CDK5 may play a pivotal role in neuronal cell death in Alzheimer's disease.

Considering the fact that phosphorylation of Ser202/Thr205 antagonizes the tau-mediated nucleation of tubulin, p25-CDK5 may play a pivotal role in neuronal cell death in Alzheimer's disease. Aberrant phosphorylation of the tau protein is considered to play a decisive role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders collectively called tauopathies (1Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). Tau is a neuron-specific, microtubule-associated protein that plays major roles in the assembly and stabilization of microtubules. In the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease, abnormally phosphorylated tau protein, paired helical filament (PHF) 1The abbreviations used are: PHF, paired helical filament; CDK5, cyclin-dependent kinase-5; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 1The abbreviations used are: PHF, paired helical filament; CDK5, cyclin-dependent kinase-5; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidtau, becomes dissociated from neuronal microtubules and accumulates in PHFs, the filamentous network generated by self-aggregation of hyperphosphorylated forms of tau. All six adult isoforms of tau are known to be hyperphosphorylated in PHFs (2Luc B. Thierry B. Valrie B.S. Andre D. Patrick R.H. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 33: 95-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that proline-directed serine/threonine kinases, together with protein phosphatases, play an important role in the hyperphosphorylation of tau (3Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Yoshida H. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 823-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Candidate protein kinases include mitogen-activated protein kinase, glycogen synthase kinase-3β, and cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (CDK5). None of these enzymes can generate PHF-tau alone (4Zheng-Fischhofer Q. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Illenberger S. Godemann R. Mandelkow E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 542-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). CDK5, initially known as brain proline-directed protein kinase or neuronal cdc2-like protein kinase, phosphorylates tau at a high stoichiometry (5Paudel H.K. Lew J. Ali Z. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23512-23518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Paudel H.K J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28328-28334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Unlike other tau kinases, the activity of CDK5 is regulated by endogenous regulatory proteins, p35 and p39. In this respect, CDK5 is distinctly different from other tau kinases (7Maccioni R.B. Otth C. Concha I.I Munoz J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1518-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Recently, calpain, a calcium-dependent protease, was found to digest both p35 and p39 to their truncated products, p25 and p29, respectively (8Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M., De La Monte S. Dikkes P. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar, 9Kusakawa G. Saito T. Onuki R. Ishiguro K. Kishimoto T. Hisanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17166-17172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Furthermore, truncation of p35 to p25 and the subsequent formation of the p25-CDK5 complex result in neuronal cell death and hyperphosphorylation of tau (10Lee M.S. Kwon Y.T., LI, M. Peng J. Friedlander R.M. Tsai L.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). From these findings, the following hypothesis emerged. Initially, various stress signals activate calpain by recruiting intracellular Ca2+, and then the activated calpain digests p35 to p25. Finally, the p25-CDK5 complex hyperphosphorylates tau proteins, causing disruption of microtubule integrity and inevitable cell death (11Smith D.S. Greer P.L. Tsai L.H. Cell Growth & Differ. 2001; 12: 277-283PubMed Google Scholar). Several criticisms of this hypothesis have appeared. Among them, the observed accumulation of p25 in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease may be accounted for by post-mortem degradation of p35 (12Taniguchi S. Fujita Y. Hayashi S. Kakita A. Takahashi H. Murayama S. Saido T.C. Hisanaga S. Iwatsubo T. Hasegawa M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In fact, p35 is notoriously unstable. Most brain-derived p35 is lost or truncated to p25 during purification. Thus, the kinetic activity of tau phosphorylation by p35-CDK5 is only poorly understood. Lack of knowledge about the regulation of CDK5 by its activators, p35 and p25, severely limits our understanding of the possible pathogenesis induced by CDK5. We have examined the kinetic characteristics ofin vitro phosphorylation of the longest isoform of human tau by CDK5 using recombinant proteins. This study clarified not only the kinetics of overall phosphorylation, but also the details of site-specific phosphorylation of human tau by CDK5 complexes. Bacterially expressed tau, the longest isoform of human tau protein, was purified as described previously (13Sobue K. Agarwal-Mawal A., Li, W. Sun W. Miura Y. Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16673-16680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. After addition of NaCl to 0.5 m, the bacterial extract was boiled in a hot bath for 10 min and centrifuged at 8000 × g. After dialysis in extraction buffer A (50 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), the supernatant was loaded onto a phosphocellulose P-11 column (Whatman) pre-cycled with 0.5 m NaOH and then equilibrated with extraction buffer A. Recombinant tau bound on the column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in extraction buffer A. The pooled fractions containing tau were concentrated with Centriprep centrifugal filter devices (Millipore Corp.) and dialyzed against extraction buffer A. After determination by Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard, tau was stored frozen at −80 °C until used. The cDNA for human CDK5 in pCMV was excised with BamHI and ligated into the BamHI site of a baculovirus transfer vector, BacPAK9 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). C-terminally His6-tagged p35 was generated by PCR amplification using pET23a-p35 as the template and oligonucleotides 5′-GGCGAATTCATGGGCACGGTGCTGTCCCT-3′ and 5′-GGGCTTTAGCGGCCGCCGGATCTCAGTG-3′ as the primers. The PCR product was cleaved with EcoRI and NotI and ligated into BacPAK9. His6-tagged p25, a deletion of amino acids 1–98 of His6-tagged p35 in BacPAK9, was generated by PCR-based mutagenesis. BacPAK9 containing CDK5, p35, or p25 cDNA was cotransfected with BacPAK6 virus DNA (Clontech) into Sf9 cells following the manufacturer's instructions. Human CDK5 stock virus was coexpressed with either p35-His6 or p25-His6 virus in Sf9 cells. The Sf9 cell-expressed human recombinant CDK5 complexes were harvested with cold phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 1600 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen pellet was thawed at 30 °C, resuspended in cold extraction buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mmimidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mmPefabloc SC, 1 μm E-64, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and sonicated three times for 10 s each at 4 °C. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column that was prewashed with extraction buffer B and then with wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15m NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole) at 4 °C. The p35-CDK5 or p25-CDK5 complex bound on the column was eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, and 350 mm imidazole. The pooled fractions containing p35-CDK5 or p25-CDK5 were dialyzed against dialysis buffer (10 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol). The concentrations of recombinant CDK5 complexes were determined using the Coomassie protein assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The purity of the purified human recombinant p35-CDK5 and p25-CDK5 complexes was assessed by double immunostaining with an anti-p35/p25 polyclonal antibody (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and an anti-CDK5 polyclonal antibody (C-8; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:1000 and 1:2000 dilutions, respectively (Fig.1). The kinase activities of the p35-CDK5 and p25-CDK5 complexes were determined as described (14Hashiguchi M. Sobue K. Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25247-25254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), except that the p35-CDK5 and p25-CDK5 complexes were used at a concentration of 15 μg/ml with recombinant tau or histone H1. The kinase assay was initiated by adding the p35-CDK5 or p25-CDK5 complex to the reaction mixtures, and then an aliquot of the reaction mixture was withdrawn and placed into a new tube containing SDS sample buffer to terminate the reaction after various incubation times. The assay mixtures were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the bands containing phosphorylated substrate were excised from the gel. For the time course analysis,32Pi incorporation into tau or histone H1 was quantified by Cerenkov counting using a liquid scintillation analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The tau bands were also saved for phosphopeptide mapping. A control reaction was performed with the same assay mixture containing bovine serum albumin instead of tau or histone H1. Tau (0.25 mg/ml) was preincubated with the p35-CDK5 or p25-CDK5 complex (15 μg/ml) and 1 mm unlabeled ATP for 23 h at 30 °C. For additional phosphorylation after occlusion by the first CDK5 complex, two separate aliquots (20 μl) from preincubation mixtures were transferred to new tubes and then incubated with fresh p35-CDK5 or p25-CDK5 complex (15 μg/ml), MgCl2 (10 mm), dithiothreitol (0.2 mm), and [γ-32P]ATP (1 mm) for another 4.5 h at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer to the assay mixtures and analyzed by tryptic phosphopeptide mapping. Recombinant tau was phosphorylated by the p35-CDK5 or p25-CDK5 complex for a particular time period at 30 °C, and then phosphorylated tau was separated by SDS-PAGE (see “In Vitro Kinetic Analysis of Tau Phosphorylation”). The bands containing tau were excised from the gel, washed three times with 25% isopropyl alcohol for 30 min, and then washed overnight with 10% methanol at room temperature. The tau bands were dried overnight at 50 °C and digested with 50 μg/ml trypsin (l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin; Sigma) in 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.4, overnight at 30 °C. The digested peptide extract was transferred to a new tube and dried with a vacuum evaporator. Dried peptides were washed with 100 μl of doubly distilled water. After centrifugal concentration, the radioactivity of the dried peptide was quantified by Cerenkov counting. The digested phosphopeptide was dissolved in TLC buffer (formic acid (88%)/glacial acetic acid/water (50:150:800), pH 1.9). An aliquot of the digested phosphopeptides containing ∼1000 cpm of radioactivity/plate was subjected to phosphopeptide mapping using silica gel thin-layer plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The first dimension of electrophoresis was carried out in TLC buffer, pH 1.9, at 10 °C: the second dimension of chromatography was carried out in n-butyl alcohol/pyridine/glacial acetic acid/water (150:100:30:120). The plates were analyzed with a BAS 2000II bioimaging analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). The silica gel on the separated phosphopeptide spots (spots 1–5) was then scratched off of the plates and recovered in scintillation vials. The radioactivity of each spot was quantified by Cerenkov counting. An anti-tau monoclonal antibody (Tau-1) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and an anti-phospho-Ser202 tau antibody (referred to below as the pS202 antibody) was obtained from Sigma. Tau-5 was purchased from NeoMarkers. A phosphorylation-dependent anti-tau antibody (AT8) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Kinase assays were carried out as described (14Hashiguchi M. Sobue K. Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25247-25254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated tau was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blotted membrane was immunostained with one of the anti-tau antibodies and then stripped with stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS) for 30 min at 50 °C. The membrane was reprobed with a different anti-tau antibody. We used anti-tau antibody AT8, the pS202 antibody, and Tau-1 at 1:500, 1:2000, and 0.5 μg/ml dilutions, respectively. The total immunoreactivity of tau against Tau-5 (1 μg/ml) was routinely monitored to adjust the total amount of loaded samples (data not shown). All data were analyzed by analysis of variance (SYSTAT Version 4, SYSTAT, Evanston, IL), and values were considered significantly different when p < 0.05. A low concentration (less than one-tenth of theK m) of recombinant tau (0.2 mg/ml) was incubated in the kinase assay mixture with the p25-CDK5 or p35-CDK5 complex. Aliquots of the assay mixture were withdrawn at 15, 30, 60, 120, 300, and 480 min. After separation of tau by SDS-PAGE,32Pi incorporation into tau was measured using a scintillation counter. A typical result is illustrated in Fig.2. Incorporation of Pi into tau by the p35-CDK5 complex was found to be very slow. In contrast, the rate of Pi incorporation into tau was much faster when it was incubated with the p25-CDK5 complex. Assuming a single exponential reaction, the time constant of the overall phosphorylation process could be determined. In the example depicted in Fig. 2, the time constants of Pi incorporation by p35-CDK5 and p25-CDK5 complexes were 164 and 68 min, respectively. Thus, phosphorylation by the p35-CDK5 complex was 2.4 times slower than that by the p25-CDK5 complex. No phosphorylation of bovine serum albumin was seen upon incubation with the CDK5 complexes (data not shown). Upon saturation of Pi incorporation, we found that 3.3 and 2.3 mol of Pi were incorporated into 1 mol of tau by the p25-CDK5 and p35-CDK5 complexes, respectively (TableI). Thus, the p25-CDK5 complex could phosphorylate at least three different sites of tau. In contrast, at least two sites could be phosphorylated by the p35-CDK5 complex. The results from four separate experiments are tabulated in Table I.Table ITime constants and stoichiometry of phosphorylation of tau and histone H1 by p35-CDK5 or p25-CDK5TauHistone H1Time constantmol Pi/substrateTime constantmol Pi/substrateminminp35-CDK5127 ± 352.3 ± 0.669 ± 102.2 ± 0.6p25-CDK563 ± 5.5ap < 0.05.3.3 ± 1.0ap < 0.05.16 ± 3.8ap < 0.05.2.3 ± 0.5Each value was obtained from at least four separate experiments (mean ± S.D.).a p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Each value was obtained from at least four separate experiments (mean ± S.D.). Although tau possesses multiple sites of phosphorylation, overall Pi incorporation by CDK5 was found to be described by the Michaelis-Menten equation. The apparent kinetic parametersK m and k cat (or turnover number) were determined. Considering the temporal characteristics, the initial velocity of phosphorylation of tau by Pi incorporation with the p35-CDK5 or p25-CDK5 complex was determined after a 35- and 15-min reaction period, respectively. Whenever possible, the initial velocity was determined using exponential fitting of data obtained during different reaction periods. Values obtained by both methods agreed reasonably well. The velocity of phosphorylation (expressed as moles of Pi/mol of enzyme/min) was determined from32Pi incorporation at three different substrate concentrations. The results were analyzed in a Hanes-Woolf plot (TableII). The Michaelis constant (K m) for phosphorylation of tau by the CDK5 complex was almost the same with either p35 or p25 (Table II), indicating that the apparent affinity of tau for the CDK5 complex was not modified by the regulatory units of CDK5.Table IIKinetic parameters of phosphorylation of tau and histone H1 by p35-CDK5 or p25-CDK5TauHistone H1K mk catk cat/K mK mk catk cat/K mμmmin−1μmmin−1p35-CDK533 ± 302.6 ± 0.70.07960 ± 1714 ± 100.23p25-CDK527 ± 2113 ± 4.5ap < 0.05.0.48104 ± 5581 ± 74ap < 0.05.0.78Each value was obtained from five separate experiments (mean ± S.D.).a p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Each value was obtained from five separate experiments (mean ± S.D.). Interestingly, the k cat (turnover number) for tau phosphorylation by p25-CDK5 was significantly greater than that by p35-CDK5 (p < 0.05) (Table II). Judging from thek cat/K m value, an indicator of enzyme potency, the p25-CDK5 complex was found to be ∼6 times more rapid in incorporating Pi into tau. The cooperativity of overall phosphorylation of tau by a CDK5 complex was examined using a Hill plot. The Hill numbers of the reaction with the p35-CDK5 and p25-CDK5 complexes were 0.75 ± 0.3 and 1.1 ± 0.4 (mean ± S.D., n = 3), respectively. These values mean no or little cooperativity, and the difference between them was not significant. Similarly, the phosphorylation of histone H1, a frequently employed but non-physiologic substrate, was studied as well (data not shown). The time constants of Pi incorporation by p35-CDK5 and by p25-CDK5 were 69 ± 10 and 16 ± 3.8 min, respectively. Phosphorylation of histone H1 by the p35-CDK5 complex was indeed slower than that by the p25-CDK5 complex. The kinetic parameters of CDK5-induced histone H1 phosphorylation were determined (TableII). To investigate the characteristics of CDK5-induced phosphorylation of each serine or threonine residue of tau, phosphopeptide mapping of tryptic digests was conducted. Both unsaturated and saturated stages of phosphorylation were subjected to analysis. Considering the fact that the p25-CDK5 complex incorporated Pi into tau twice as fast as the p35-CDK5 complex, kinase action was terminated after 0.5 and 1 h for the p25-CDK5 and p35-CDK5 complexes, respectively. The duration was chosen to be approximately half of the time constant of each CDK5 complex so that 63% of the phosphorylatable sites were phosphorylated in each case. An extended reaction time of 8 or 23 h was adapted to saturate all of the phosphorylatable sites. A typical example of phosphopeptide mapping is shown in Fig. 3. The maps reveal five major spots and some minor spots after 8 h of phosphorylation (Fig. 3, C and D). In contrast to the density of the other spots, the density of spot 1 obtained after 1 h of reaction was weak in the presence of either p35 or p25 (Fig. 3, A and B), indicating that spot 1 was phosphorylated more slowly than the other spots. In fact, the density of spot 1 obtained after 8 h of reaction with the p25-CDK5 complex was comparable with those of the other spots (Fig.3 D). However, the density of spot 1 obtained after 8 h of reaction with the p35-CDK5 complex was still weaker (Fig.3 C). The predicted locations of the peptides known to be phosphorylated by CDK5 complexes were calculated by the method described by Boyle et al. (15Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). A comparison between the observed and predicted phosphopeptide maps revealed that spot 1 corresponded to the doubly phosphorylated Ser202/Thr205 peptide (195SGYSSPGSPGTPGSR209). Spots 2 and 3 corresponded to the phosphorylated Ser202 peptide (195SGYSSPGSPGTPGSR209) and the phosphorylated Ser404 peptide (396SPVVSGDTSPR406), respectively. Spots 4 and 5 seemed to be derived from fully and partially digested Ser235 peptides (231TPPKSPSSAK240and 235SPSSAK240, respectively). To quantify the time-dependent phosphorylation of the five major spots, 32Pi incorporation into each spot was measured. After visualization of the spots using the BAS 2000II bioimaging analyzer, each spot was marked. The silica gel on each spot was then removed from the glass plate, and radioactivity was measured using a scintillation counter (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 4 illustrates a typical example of such experiments. Only spot 1 was plotted. After 8 h of incubation, the p25-CDK5 complex was found to phosphorylate Ser202/Thr205 (corresponding to spot 1) to a steady level. In contrast, phosphorylation of Ser202/Thr205 by the p35-CDK5 complex was extremely slow compared with the other sites. Even after 8 h of incubation, the density of spot 1 remained <5% of the sum of Pi incorporation into the five major spots. The phosphorylation rate of Ser202 (corresponding to spot 2) alone was found to be much faster than the double phosphorylation of Ser202/Thr205 (Fig. 3). The p35-CDK5 complex increased relative 32Pi incorporation into Ser202 steadily, whereas a slow decline in relative32Pi incorporation into Ser202 was noticed after 2 h. These results indicate that the phosphorylation rate of Ser202 or Thr205 is slow compared with the overall phosphorylation rate. Furthermore, double phosphorylation of two adjacent sites may be a complicated phenomenon (see below). To characterize the slow Pi incorporation into tau by the CDK5 complex, we carried out phosphopeptide mapping after prolonged incubation with unlabeled ATP. In the experiment depicted in Fig. 5, tau was phosphorylated with unlabeled ATP for 23 h, a period long enough to allow occlusion of most of the phosphorylatable sites of tau; and then [γ-32P]ATP was added (see “Experimental Procedures”). Thus, Pi incorporation into tau after occlusion was readily visualized by phosphopeptide mapping (Fig.5). After an extended incubation of tau with the p25-CDK5 complex, addition of [γ-32P]ATP with fresh p25-CDK5 complex resulted in a remarkable increase in the density of spot 1. The rest of the spots became only faintly noticeable (Fig. 5, Top). Thus, double phosphorylation of Ser202 and Thr205 (spot 1) was not accomplished by the p25-CDK5 complex, whereas single phosphorylation of Ser202 (spot 2) was almost complete. In contrast, addition of the p35-CDK5 complex after occlusion by the p25-CDK5 complex failed to increase the density of specific sites (data not shown). Tau was also incubated with the p35-CDK5 complex for 23 h with unlabeled ATP. Pi incorporation was then visualized by addition of [γ-32P]ATP together with the p25-CDK5 complex. In this case, both spots 1 and 2 became dense (Fig. 5,Bottom), suggesting that neither Ser202 nor Thr205 was occluded by the p35-CDK5 complex. Site-specific phosphorylation of tau was analyzed using phosphorylation-dependent anti-tau antibodies over an extended period of up to 24 h. Aliquots were withdrawn from the reaction mixture, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a membrane that was then probed with anti-tau antibody. Whenever possible, the membrane was stripped and reprobed with other anti-tau antibodies. AT8 reactivity was first detected 3 h after incubation with the p25-CDK5 complex. It developed slowly during the subsequent incubation period. After 24 h of incubation, prominent AT8 reactivity was achieved by the p25-CDK5 complex. In contrast, only a faint AT8 signal was detected with the p35-CDK5 complex even after 24 h of incubation (Fig. 6 A). The p25-CDK5 complex had a much higher level of phosphorylation on the AT8 epitopes compared with the p35-CDK5 complex. Phosphorylation of Ser202/Thr205 was also monitored by Tau-1 using the same membrane. After 20 min of incubation with the p25-CDK5 complex, the Tau-1 band showed a retardation in mobility, and then the Tau-1 signal began to disappear progressively. The Tau-1 signal became negligible 1 h after incubation with the p25-CDK5 complex, indicating that unphosphorylated Ser202or Thr205 diminished steadily. The change in Tau-1 reactivity after incubation with p35-CDK5 was essentially the same as for the p25-CDK5 complex, but was very slow; the mobility of the Tau-1 band began to retard, and then Tau-1 reactivity disappeared progressively (Fig. 6 B). The same membrane was reprobed with the pS202 antibody, an anti-tau antibody raised solely against phosphorylated Ser202. When tau was phosphorylated by the p35-CDK5 complex, the pS202 antibody signal became detectable after 3 h of incubation, with an indication of a retardation in mobility, and then it became dense very slowly, without any indication of saturation, even after 24 h. As expected, the p25-CDK5 complex induced a rapid increase in the reactivity of the pS202 antibody, maximizing during the 3-h incubation period (Fig. 6 C). As phosphorylation proceeded, the mobility of the pS202 antibody band became retarded. However, a decrease in the reactivity of the pS202 antibody after prolonged exposure to the p25-CDK5 complex was not associated with a mobility change. Thus, the observed decrease in the pS202 antibody reactivity did not result from dephosphorylation of the pS202 antibody. This study determined the kinetic characteristics of in vitro phosphorylation of tau by CDK5 complexes using recombinant proteins. The p25-CDK5 complex was found to phosphorylate tau much faster than the p35-CDK5 complex. On the assumption that the time course of total phosphorylation can be approximated by a single exponential reaction, the time constant of the decline in phosphorylatable sites was determined, and the results suggest that p25 can accelerate the catalytic activity of CDK5 by ∼2.4-fold compared with p35. We determined the stoichiometry (moles of Pi/mol of tau) of tau phosphorylation by CDK5 and found that the p25-CDK5 complex can phosphorylate tau faster. Furthermore, it can incorporate more phosphate into tau compared with the p35-CDK5 complex. The stoichiometry of tau phosphorylation by neuronal cdc2-like protein kinase (brain-derived p25-CDK5 complex) was reported to be 3.8 mol of phosphate/mol of tau (5Paudel H.K. Lew J. Ali Z. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23512-23518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the recombinant p25-CDK5 complex used in the present study is as potent as the naturally occurring CDK5 complex. Sironi et al. (16Sironi J.J. Yen S.H. Gondal J.A., Wu, Q. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) studied in vitrophosphorylation of tau at Ser262 by three different kinases (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, protein kinase A, and phosphorylase kinase) and found that total Piincorporation into tau by any of the three enzymes saturated after 100 min of reaction. Upon saturation of overall phosphorylation, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, protein kinase A, and phosphorylase kinase incorporated 0.9–1.2 mol of phosphate/mol of tau. Purified phosphorylase kinase from rabbit skeletal muscle reportedly phosphorylated tau to a stoichiometry of 2.1 mol of phosphate/mol of tau (17Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1777-1785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Compared with these results, the stoichiometry of overall phosphorylation of tau by the p25-CDK5 complex is characteristically high. To evaluate the phosphorylation of tau by CDK5 quantitatively, kinetic parameters were determined using the Michaelis-Menten equation. The apparent K m andk cat values for tau phosphorylation by the p35-CDK5 complex were 33 μm and 2.6 min−1, respectively. The K m value for the p25-CDK5 complex was 27 μm and was unchanged from that for the p35-CDK5 complex (p < 0.05, n = 4). Thek cat value for the p25-CDK5 complex was 13 min−1 and was significantly larger than that for the p35-CDK5 (p < 0.05, n = 4). Thek cat/K m value for the p25-CDK5 complex was 6 times larger than that for the p35-CDK5 complex. The kinetic parameters of CDK5 complexes were also determined using histone H1 as a substrate. The observed K m value for the p35-CDK5 complex was in good agreement with previous results (18Sharma P. Steinbach P.J. Sharma M. Amin N.D. Barchi Jr., J.J. Pant H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9600-9606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The difference in the K m values for the p25-CDK5 and p35-CDK5 complexes was not significant, whereas thek cat/K m value for the p25-CDK5 complex was significantly larger than that for the p25-CDK5 complex. Thus, the p25-CDK5 complex is a much more potent kinase, and the p25 regulatory unit accelerates the reactivity of CDK5 without changing its affinity for tau. For tau phosphorylation by phosphorylase kinase, theK m and k cat values were 6.9 μm and 47.4 min−1, respectively, indicating that phosphorylase kinase has a better affinity for tau and more efficient turnover of catalytic activity compared with CDK5 complexes (17Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1777-1785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). But the stoichiometry of total phosphorylation of tau by the p25-CDK5 complex is larger than that for the other tau kinases, including the p35-CDK5 complex. As a tau kinase, p25-CDK5 could contribute to the high phosphorylation stoichiometry of PHF-tau. Our analysis of the total phosphorylation of tau revealed a difference in the catalytic activity of CDK5 complexes; site-specific phosphorylation must be clarified for a better understanding of CDK5. We have employed two independent approaches: phosphopeptide mapping of the tryptic digest of tau and Western blot analysis with phosphorylation-dependent anti-tau antibodies. By comparing the phosphopeptide maps for the early and saturated stages of phosphorylation, we found that 32Piincorporation into spot 1 was very slow. In contrast,32Pi incorporation into the other four spots was almost complete within 120 min, suggesting that the time course of overall phosphorylation of tau depends on the phosphorylation kinetics of Ser202, Ser235, and Ser404. We further examined this unreported characteristic of site-specific phosphorylation of Ser202 and Thr205. We have made the following observations. (a) The p35-CDK5 complex promoted 32Pi incorporation into spot 1 very slowly; and (b) the p25-CDK5 complex promoted32Pi incorporation into spot 1 more rapidly, but only after 2 h. These results raise the possibility of sequential phosphorylation of Thr205 after Ser202. To investigate 32Pi incorporation, we conducted phosphopeptide mapping after having occluded possible phosphorylation sites with unlabeled ATP. Newly incorporated32Pi was visualized as an intense spot on the map. After occlusion with the p25-CDK5 complex, p25-CDK5 promoted32Pi incorporation into spot 1 only.32Pi incorporation into any of the major spots did not happen. These findings suggest that phosphorylation of Ser202 was already saturated and that only Thr205 was slowly phosphorylated over the extended time of incubation. In contrast, the p35-CDK5 complex failed to occlude both spots 1 and 2, as suggested by the intense signal on the two spots. The occlusion experiment also confirmed that slow phosphorylation by CDK5 complexes happens only at Ser202and Thr205. To clarify further the time dependence of phosphorylation of Ser202 and Thr205, Western blot analysis of tau was carried out. The three phosphorylation-dependent anti-tau antibodies have distinct epitopes. AT8 reacts with tau only when multiple sites around Ser202, including Ser199, Ser202, and Thr205, are phosphorylated. Single phosphorylation of any of the residues is not enough for AT8 reactivity (19Goedert M. Jakes R. Vanmechelen E. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 189: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 20Preuss U. Doring F. Illenberger S. Mandelkow E.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1397-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, AT8 is useful in detecting phosphorylation of Ser202/Thr205 for proline-directed kinases, including CDK5 complexes. In contrast, Tau-1 requires an absolutely non-phosphorylated epitope around Ser202 (21Szendrei G.I. Lee V.M. Otvos Jr., L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 34: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In the present study, Tau-1 reacted with recombinant tau quite well. However, phosphorylation of Ser202 or Thr205 caused loss of Tau-1 reactivity. The pS202 antibody is raised against phosphorylated Ser202 of human tau. AT8 reactivity was latent, whereas the Tau-1 signal started to decline without delay, suggesting that Ser202 and Thr205 cannot be phosphorylated simultaneously. Either Ser202 or Thr205 must be phosphorylated first. The phosphorylated Ser202 signal (immunoreactivity of the pS202 antibody) started to develop as soon as the Tau-1 signal disappeared. Although phosphorylation of Thr205 as a first step of sequential phosphorylation cannot be ruled out, the initial phosphorylation of Ser202 and the subsequent phosphorylation of Thr205 seem to be the principal route to double phosphorylation. Many of the pathologic epitopes on hyperphosphorylated tau in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients were thought to be generated by sequential phosphorylation by different tau kinases. For example, phosphorylation of a specific amino acid residue by CDK5 is a prerequisite for the subsequent kinase action of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (22Sengupta A., Wu, Q. Grundke-Iqbal K. Singh T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 167: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 23Alvarrez A. Toro R. Cacere A. Maccioni R.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Thr212 by glycogen synthase kinase-3β is known to facilitate protein kinase A action on Ser214 (4Zheng-Fischhofer Q. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Illenberger S. Godemann R. Mandelkow E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 542-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Such hierarchy among tau kinases (24Jicha G.A. O'Donnell A. Weaver C. Angeletti R. Davies P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 214-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) makes it complicated to clarify the mechanism of abnormal phosphorylation of tau. We have shown evidence for the sequential phosphorylation of Ser202 and Thr205 of tau by the p25-CDK5 complex. Phosphorylation of Thr205 occurred only after Ser202 was phosphorylated. As a result, phosphorylation of Thr205 was extremely slow compared with phosphorylation of other sites such as Ser235 and Ser404. In addition, the p35-CDK5 complex had weak or negligible kinase action on Thr205. Our findings strongly suggest that cleavage of p35 to p25 regulates not only the overall kinase activity of CDK5, but also the sequential phosphorylation of Ser202 and Thr205. The association of CDK5 with a particular activator unit, p35 or p25, provides a novel mechanism of controlling kinase characteristics. We appreciate the initial help of Dr. H. K. Paudel.

The formation of AGEs in vivocontributes to the pathophysiologies associated with aging and the long-term complications of diabetes (4Koschinsky T. He C.J. Mitsuhashi T. Bucala R. Liu C. Buenting C. Heitmann K. Vlassara H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6474-6479Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that MG accumulates rapidly in endothelial cells cultured under hyperglycemic conditions (5Shinohara M. Thornalley P.J. Giardino I. Beisswenger P. Thorpe S.R. Onorato J. Brownlee M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1142-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Thus, glycation of proteins by MG has been linked to mechanisms of disease. MG is hypothesized to be a modulator of cell proliferation because of its cytotoxic properties. Indeed, the high glycolytic activity of proliferating cells, such as tumor cells, increases the intracellular levels of MG (6Egyud L.G. Szent-Gyorgyi A. Science. 1968; 160: 1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 7Thornalley P.J. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1995; 20: 99-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The principal route for MG catabolism is the glyoxalase pathway, which consists of two enzymes, glyoxalase I (GLO1) and glyoxalase II. Abnormal expression or activity of GLO1 has been demonstrated in some human tumors, including prostate and colon (8Davidson S.D. Cherry J.P. Choudhury M.S. Tazaki H. Mallouh C. Konno S. J. Urol. 1999; 161: 690-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9Ranganathan S. Walsh E.S. Tew K.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that GLO1 was frequently over-expressed in human lung carcinoma cells and that the expression levels of GLO1 are closely linked with the cellular sensitivity to the GLO1-inhibitor agent (10Sakamoto H. Mashima T. Sato S. Hashimoto Y. Yamori T. Tsuruo T. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 2513-2518PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the increase of glycolytic activity could be associated with the tumorigenicity. The post-translational modification of protein, including phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, and ubiquitination, is involved in the regulation of cell proliferative activity. It has been demonstrated that MG reacts with arginine and lysine residues to formN-(5-hydroxy-4,6-dimethylpyrimidine-2-yl)-l-ornithine (argpyrimidine) (11Shipanova I.N. Glomb M.A. Nagaraj R.H. Arch.

In tumor cells with high glycolytic activity, however, MG-modified proteins have not been identified nor is the functional biological significance well defined. Here, we found that the formation of argpyrimidine in some proteins was constitutively detected in several human cancer cell lines. To clarify proteins that are regulated by MG, we purified MG-modified protein by immunoaffinity chromatography using an anti-argpyrimidine antibody. We found that MG modified heat-shock protein 27 (Hsp27) at the C-terminal Arg-188 in cells. We demonstrated that MG modification was involved in Hsp27 oligomerlization to prevent cytochrome c-mediated caspase activation. These observations indicated that the post-translational modification by MG plays an important role in regulating Hsp27-mediated cell survival. Argpyrimidine was kindly provided by the NOF Corporation (Tokyo, Japan). [2-14C]MG was custom synthesized by Muromachi Pharmaceuticals Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Campthothecin (CPT) was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan), and etoposide (VP-16) was kindly provided by Bristol-Meyers Squibb Co. Ltd. OPB-9195 was developed by Otsuka Pharmaceuticals (Tokyo, Japan). Human leukemia U937, K562, HL-60, Jurkat, lung cancer NCI-H23, A549, colon cancer HT-29, renal cancer ACHN, and prostate cancer PC-3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. 293T and HT1080 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. U937 cells (109 cells) were lysed in buffer A (50 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 0.1% CHAPS, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) by Dounce homogenization. The lysate was clarified through successive centrifugation steps (a 1,000 × g spin followed by a 10,000 ×g spin) at 4 °C. Mouse monoclonal anti-argpyrimidine antibody (mAb3C) (NOF Corporation) was coupled with Affi Gel-HZ (Bio-Rad), according to the supplier's instructions. The cell lysate was applied on an immunoaffinity column equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl to remove unbound proteins. Bound proteins were eluted with 0.2 m glycin-HCl (pH 2.5). Column fractions were resolved on SDS-PAGE, and proteins were visualized using Coomassie Blue staining. Purified 27-kDa protein was digested with lysyl endproteinase from Lysobacter enzymogenes (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, at 37 °C for 16 h. The peptide fragments obtained were separated by reversed-phase HPLC on a column of Puresil C18 (Waters, Milford, MA) using linear gradient (0 to 60%) of 2-propanol/acetonitrile (7:3) in distilled water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Elution profiles were monitored by absorbance at 220 nm, and the peptide fragments were manually collected. The amino acid sequence analyses of the peptide fragments fractionated by HPLC were performed with PPSQ-21 gas-phase sequencer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, 150 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The lysates were incubated with protein G-agarose conjugated with an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Sigma), a rabbit anti-Hsp27 polyclonal antibody (pAb) (StressGen Biotechnologies, Victoria, British Columbia), or an anti-Hsp27 mAb (StressGen). Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (10Sakamoto H. Mashima T. Sato S. Hashimoto Y. Yamori T. Tsuruo T. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 2513-2518PubMed Google Scholar). The antibodies used were anti-argpyrimidine mAb, anti-Hsp70 mAb (StressGen), and anti-cleaved caspase-9 and -3 (Cell Signaling Technology). For immunostaining analysis, cells were fixed on a Lab-Tec II chamber slide (Nunc) with cold methanol and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. The fixed cells were incubated with an anti-argpyrimidine antibody. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The cells were analyzed using fluorescence microscopy. The wild-type humanHsp27 gene and its mutants, in which arginine residues were substituted with glycine residues, were inserted into the pFLAG-CMV-1 vector (Kodak, New Heaven, CT) or pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Mutagenesis of Hsp27 cDNA was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Transient transfection of 293T cells was performed by using the calcium phosphate precipitate method. Stable transfection of HT1080 cells was performed by using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and transfected cells were treated with 800 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Expression of Hsp27 in isolated clones was analyzed using immunoblot. Nuclei-free, mitochondria-free cytosolic extracts were prepared as described (18Bruey J.M. Paul C. Fromentin A. Hilpert S. Arrigo A.P. Solary E. Garrido C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4855-4863Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Cell-free extracts (100 μg) were incubated with 10 μmcytochrome c from bovine heart (Sigma) and 1 mmdATP (Sigma) for 30 min. Caspase activity in the supernatant was evaluated. Drug-treated cell lysates were incubated with 20 mm DEVD-MCA or LEHD-MCA at 37 °C for 90 min, and the release of amino-4-methylcoumarin was monitored with a spectrofluorometer (F-2500; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan), using an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Gel filtration analysis was performed as described previously (18Bruey J.M. Paul C. Fromentin A. Hilpert S. Arrigo A.P. Solary E. Garrido C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4855-4863Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) using a Dounce homogenizer. Supernatants were then applied to a Bio-Gel A-1.5 m column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with lysis buffer devoid of Triton X-100. The fractions eluting from the column were analyzed by immunoblot. To estimate the molecular mass, Gel Filtration Standard (Bio-Rad) was used (thyrogloburin, 670 kDa; bovine gamma globulin, 158 kDa; chicken ovalbumin, 44 kDa). The sensitivity of tumor cell lines to drugs was evaluated by cell growth inhibition after a 48-h incubation with CPT or VP-16. The number of viable cells was estimated by the MTS method using CellTiter 96 AQueousOne Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega). Cells were fixed in 70% ethanol. After treatment with 0.1 mg/ml of RNase, the cells were stained in 50 μg/ml of propidium iodide solution and then analyzed using a BD Biosciences FACScan flow cytometer. We detected argpyrimidine, an MG-arginine adduct, in human cancer cells by immunostaining analysis. A previous study (13Oya T. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Miyata S. Maeda S. Osawa T. Uchida K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18492-18502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) has indicated that the argpyrimidine-directed antibody, mAb3C, selectively recognized MG-modified proteins in diabetic tissues. Using this antibody we found significant argpyrimidine immunoreactivity in some human tumor cell lines, including lung cancer NCI-H23 cells (Fig.1 A) and leukemia U937 cells (data not shown). Argpyrimidine was mainly localized in the cytoplasm. To purify proteins that are modified by MG, the lysate of U937 cells was applied to immunoaffinity chromatography using anti-argpyrimidine monoclonal antibody. Eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE in a gel followed by Coomassie Blue staining. As shown in Fig.1 B, the protein fraction contained mainly a 27-kDa polypeptide. Other protein bands were also present in the immunoaffinity elution. The 27-kDa protein was recognized from the lysates of various cancer cells by Western blot analysis using anti-argpyrimidine antibody (Fig. 1 C). To test the specificity of the antibody, 27-kDa protein recognition was effectively competed by an excess amount of argpyrimidine (Fig. 1 C). Because MG is increased in proliferating cells with high glycolytic activity, we next examined whether MG modification fluctuates in response to the glucose condition. We found that MG modification under a high glucose condition was increased over that seen under normal conditions (Fig. 1 D). Moreover, a glucose-free condition reduced MG modification (Fig. 1 D). These results suggest that MG modification of the 27-kDa protein regulates cell growth in tumor cells with high glycolytic activity. To determine the identity of the 27-kDa protein it was digested by lysyl endopeptidase and resolved as individual peptides by HPLC. As a result the internal peptides identified with human Hsp27 upon comparison with standard sequencing databases in the public domain (BLAST) (Fig. 1 E). To determine whether MG could bind directly to Hsp27, we assessed the [14C]MG in FLAG-tagged Hsp27 incorporation into 293T cells. The immunoprecipitated Hsp27 showed an ∼5-fold increase in MG binding over the control or the immunoprecipitated green fluorescent protein (Fig.2 A). To confirm modification of Hsp27 by MG, we performed immunoblot analysis after immunoprecipitation with the anti-Hsp27 antibody. As shown in Fig.2 B, we found that endogenous Hsp27 formed agrpyrimidine in U937 cells. These results indicated that Hsp27 was modified by MG to form argpyrimidine. The human Hsp27 protein contains 16 arginine residues. To identify the MG modification site of Hsp27, all arginine codons in Hsp27cDNA were converted to glycine codons, and 293T cells were transfected with those mutants. As shown in Fig. 2 C, only the mutation of Hsp27 at arginine 188 to glycine (Hsp27/R188G) significantly decreased the formation of argpyrimidine. A similar result was obtained with the lysine mutant Hsp27/R188K (data not shown). Consistently, Hsp27/R188G did not interact with [14C]MG in cells (Fig. 2 D). These results indicate that MG specifically modified Hsp27 at the C-terminal Arg-188 to form argpyrimidine in cells. Next, we stably transfected HT1080 cells with the empty pcDNA3 plasmid (mock) or the plasmid containing wild-type or the R188G-mutatedHsp27 cDNA. Expression of these proteins was determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig.3 A). The doubling time of the HT1080 cells was not affected by the over-expression of these proteins. It was previously (19Lambert H. Charette S.J. Bernier A.F. Guimond A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9378-9385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 20Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G. Ducasse C. Paul C. Wieske M. Arrigo A.P. Buchner J. Gaestel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18947-18956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) reported that human Hsp27 could form oligomeric complexes resulting in both smaller and larger oligomers. We examined the effect of MG modification on Hsp27 oligomerization. The oligomeric size of Hsp27 in cells was analyzed by size distribution gel filtration chromatography. The wild-type Hsp27 formed complexes of 50–650 kDa with both smaller and larger oligomers (Fig. 3 B,upper panel). The fraction containing large oligomeric Hsp27 was recognized by the anti-argpyrimidine antibody (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, the R188G mutant exclusively formed small multimers lower than 100 kDa (Fig. 3 B, lower panels). These results suggest that MG modification could be involved in the formation of high-order molecular complexes of Hsp27. It has been demonstrated that the formation of large oligomeric Hsp27 prevents cytochromec-mediated caspase activation and apoptosis (18Bruey J.M. Paul C. Fromentin A. Hilpert S. Arrigo A.P. Solary E. Garrido C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4855-4863Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We examined whether MG modification could affect the regulation of caspase activation by Hsp27 using a cell-free system. The addition of cytochrome c and dATP to extracts from control-transfected 293T led to caspase-3 and -9 activation (Fig.4 A). Extracts from Hsp27 over expressing cells inhibited the activation of caspases, whereas no inhibition was observed in extracts from MG-unmodified mutant Hsp27/R188G-transfected cells (Fig. 4 A). Caspase activation involves cleavage of the proform of the enzymes to generate proteolytically active subunits. Cleavage of procaspase-9 and procaspase-3, after addition of cytochrome c plus dATP, was blocked by cytosolic extracts containing Hsp27 but was not blocked by cytosolic Hsp27/R188G protein (Fig. 4 B). These results indicate that MG modification of Hsp27 is required for suppression of cytochrome c-mediated caspase activation. To examine the effect of MG modification on apoptosis induction, cells were treated with several anti-tumor agents. The wild-type Hsp27 transfectant cells were significantly resistant to CPT and etoposide (VP-16) compared with the parental or mock-transfectant cells (Fig. 5 A). The anti-apoptotic activity of Hsp27 was abrogated by the MG-binding site mutant R188G. Unexpectedly, R188G-mutated Hsp27 transfectant cells were markedly sensitized against these agents (Fig. 5 A). Consistent with this, CPT- and VP-16-induced caspase activation was partially inhibited in the wild-type Hsp27 transfectant cells and was enhanced in the R188G-mutated Hsp27 transfectant cells (Fig.5 B). To define the role of endogenously produced MG further, we examined the effect of an inhibitor of advanced glycation, OPB-9195, on anti-tumor drug-induced cell death. OPB-9195 has been shown to trap glucose-derived reactive carbonyl compounds, such as MG, glyoxal, and 3-deoxyglucosone, and thereby to inhibit the formation of AGEs (21Nakamura S. Makita Z. Ishikawa S. Yasumura K. Fujii W. Yanagisawa K. Kawata T. Koike T. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 895-899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,22Miyata T. Ueda Y. Yamada Y. Izuhara Y. Wada T. Jadoul M. Saito A. Kurokawa K. van Ypersele de Strihou C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 2349-2356PubMed Google Scholar). In wild-type Hsp27 transfectant cells, OPB-9195 markedly enhanced VP-16-induced apoptosis but was less effective in the mock-transfected cells (Fig. 5 C). Moreover, to clarify the link between MG modification of Hsp27 and the effect of endogenous MG on apoptosis, we did the same experiments using Hsp27-positive and -negative leukemia cells. OPB-9195 significantly accelerated apoptosis in U937 cells that expressed large amounts of Hsp27 but not in Jurkat and HEL cells that did not express Hsp27 protein (Fig. 5, D andE). In U937 cells, removal of intracellular MG by lengthy treatment with OPB-9195 resulted in reduced MG modification of Hsp27 (Fig. 5 F) and provoked a change in the size distribution of the complexes that shifted from large oligomers to small oligomers (Fig. 5 G). These results indicated that MG modification of Hsp27 is essential for the protective ability against apoptosis induced by anti-tumor agents. Endogenously produced MG plays roles in apoptosis (23Okado A. Kawasaki Y. Hasuike Y. Takahashi M. Teshima T. Fujii J. Taniguchi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32299-322305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that high levels of MG are present in cultured cells, and the most biogenic MG (>99%) is involved in reversible and irreversible interactions in vivo (29Chaplen F.W. Fahl W.E. Cameron D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5533-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, the full molecular targets of MG remain unknown. In this study, we identified proteins that are modified by MG in human carcinoma cells, suggesting a novel mode for regulation of cell death. We indicated that MG modified endogenous or over-expressed Hsp27 to form argpyrimidine, one of the MG-arginine adducts (Fig. 2, A and B). MG modification of Hsp27 could be of general significance because argpyrimidine was detected in several cell lines (Fig. 1 C) and tissues (data not shown). MG specifically modified Hsp27 only at Arg-188 in cells. Thus, it is probable that this modification is mediated by an unidentified enzymatic reaction. Also, MG may modify cellular proteins other than Hsp27. Indeed, we observed some polypeptides that formed argpyrimidine by immunoaffinity purification (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, in addition to arginine, lysine residues of proteins are potential targets of MG. It has been reported that MG forms N-carboxyethyllysine (15Ahmed M.U. Brinkmann F.E. Degenhardt T.P. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), an MG-lysine adduct, in tissue proteins in aging and age-related diseases. These observations suggest that endogenous MG could physiologically modify cellular proteins, including Hsp27. Hsp27 is expressed at various levels in different cell types and tissues. In cells, Hsp27 exists as homotypic multimers ranging from dimers up to 700-kDa oligomers (19Lambert H. Charette S.J. Bernier A.F. Guimond A. Landry J. J. Biol.

Hsp27 is regulated at post-translational levels by stress and by cytokines and growth factors that trigger stress-activated protein kinase 2 (SAPK2/p38), the upstream activator of MAPKAP kinase 2 (30Landry J.

Phosphorylation causes a major change in the structure of Hsp27, a shift from large 700-kDa multimers to dimers (19Lambert H. Charette S.J. Bernier A.F. Guimond A. Landry J. J. Biol.

We examined the phosphorylations of Hsp27 using phospho-specific antibodies. In the R188G mutant of Hsp27, Hsp27 phosphorylation was not elevated but was rather decreased, compared with wild-type Hsp27. 2H. Sakamoto, T. Mashima, K. Yamamoto, and T. Tsuruo, unpublished observation. These observations indicate that MG modification contributes to the formation of high-order molecular complexes of Hsp27 through a mechanism that is independent of phosphorylation. Recently, the structure of a small Hsp from Methanococcus jannaschii, Hsp16.5, was defined by crystallographic analysis (33Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H.

The C-terminal region of one subunit reaches out and interacts with neighboring subunits by hydrophobic interaction and backbone hydrogen bonding (33Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). In Hsp27, our results show that the Arg-188 residue at the C terminus is modified by MG to form argpyrimidine. Further, MG modification at the C terminus could be involved in hydrophobic interaction with neighboring subunits of Hsp27 and the formation of large oligomers because argpyrimidine has the aromatic hydroxy group, just as the tyrosine residue does. Further studies are needed to clarify the structural organization of Hsp27 in the process of MG modification. Over-expression of Hsp27 enhances the survival of cells exposed to a variety of death stimuli, including oxidative stress (20Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G. Ducasse C.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2661-2667PubMed Google Scholar). Various mechanisms for its protective activity have been proposed. Hsp27 was reported to inhibit the processing of procaspase-9 and the other downstream enzymes (37Bruey J.M. Ducasse C. Bonniaud P. Ravagnan L. Susin S.A. Diaz-Latoud C. Gurbuxani S. Arrigo A.P. Kroemer G. Solary E. Garrido C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 38Garrido C. Bruey J.M. Fromentin A. Hammann A. Arrigo A.P. Solary E. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2061-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Our present results show that MG modification of Hsp27 is essential to prevent caspase-9 and -3 activation (Fig. 4). It has been reported that Hsp27 binds to cytochrome c and prevents cytochrome c-mediated caspase activation (37Bruey J.M. Ducasse C. Bonniaud P. Ravagnan L. Susin S.A. Diaz-Latoud C. Gurbuxani S. Arrigo A.P. Kroemer G. Solary E. Garrido C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Moreover, the protective activity of Hsp27 is correlated with the ability of the protein to form large oligomers (20Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G. Ducasse C. Paul C. Wieske M. Arrigo A.P. Buchner J. Gaestel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18947-18956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, in the present study, the wild-type Hsp27 proteins that can form large oligomers interact with cytochrome c to interfere with caspase-dependent apoptosis (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Conversely, Hsp27/R188G that cannot form the large oligomers did not. Therefore, MG modification may modulate the protective ability of Hsp27 through the interaction of cytochrome c. We speculate that the protective effect of transfected Hsp27 is not strong in HT1080 cells because HT1080 cells already express some amounts of Hsp27 under constitutive conditions (Fig. 3 A). Supporting this notion was the observation of a cytoprotective effect of Hsp27 in Jurkat cells, which do not express Hsp27 (data not shown). As for the pro-apoptotic effect of R188G, we have data that shows, when HT1080 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing FLAG-Hsp27 (WT) plus R188G, addition of R188G caused dissociation of high molecular weight FLAG-Hsp27 oligomers to lower molecular-sized complexes (data not shown). When R188G was co-expressed with Hsp27 (WT) in Jurkat cells that did not express endogenous Hsp27, the cytoprotective effect of Hsp27 (WT) against VP-16-induced apoptosis was abolished. On the other hand, when R188G was expressed alone, we did not observe enhancement of apoptosis (data not shown). These results indicate that the R188G mutant acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of endogenous Hsp27. In addition, besides cytochrome c, Hsp27 can interact with such apoptosis-related proteins as protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) (39Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Kuroda S. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), which generates a survival signal in response to growth factor stimulation, and Daxx (40Charette S.J. Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7602-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), a mediator of Fas-induced apoptosis, and can regulate the protective function against apoptotic cell death. MG modification of Hsp27 may also affect the interaction between Hsp27 and such proteins as these to modulate apoptosis at a step upstream of caspase activation. Regulation of MG-modified Hsp27 is of great interest and could provide further insights into the protective ability of Hsp27. To further determine the chaperone activity of WT or R188G mutants in cells, we estimated the protective activity of each protein against heat inactivation of luciferase in transiently transfected HT1080 cells using the method previously described (41Ito H. Kamei K. Iwamoto I. Inaguma Y. Nahara D. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5346-5352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In short, cells were subjected to heat treatment at 45 °C for 6 h and then cultured at 37 °C for 16 h. The wild-type Hsp27 showed a strong protective effect against heat inactivation of luciferase, whereas that effect was greatly reduced in the R188G mutant of Hsp27 (data not shown). These data indicate that MG modification plays a critical role in chaperone activity of Hsp27. Homeostasis is maintained through a balance between cell proliferation and cell death. MG can alter the balance because it induces or inhibits apoptosis. High concentrations of MG act as a pro-apoptotic modulator by activating c-Jun N-terminal kinase and caspase proteases (25Kang Y. Edwards L.G. Thornalley P.J. Leuk. Res. 1996; 20: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Cytotoxic effects of MG are considered to be the result of DNA damage because MG is capable of inducing DNA modification and DNA-protein cross-link (29Chaplen F.W. Fahl W.E. Cameron D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5533-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). On the other hand, our results indicated that endogenous MG prevents cells from undergoing apoptosis by maintaining Hsp27 anti-apoptotic activity. MG-mediated anti-apoptotic effects may depend on the expression levels of MG-modified protein, including Hsp27 (Fig. 5, D and E). In conclusion, we found that MG can modify Hsp27 in cells and that this modification contributes to oligomerization and protection from caspase-dependent cell death. Hsp27 expression is involved in tumorigenicity (42Garrido C. Fromentin A. Bonnotte B. Favre N. Moutet M. Arrigo A.P. Mehlen P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5495-5499PubMed Google Scholar) and tumor malignancy (26Cornford P.A. Dodson A.R. Parsons K.F. Desmond A.D. Woolfenden A. Fordham M.

Also, the intracellular levels of MG should be increased in some tumor cells with a high glycolytic activity (6Egyud L.G. Szent-Gyorgyi A. Science. 1968; 160: 1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 7Thornalley P.J. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1995; 20: 99-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, these studies provide information that could aid in developing cancer chemotherapeutic approaches by preventing Hsp27 anti-apoptotic activity. We thank Drs. A. Tomida, M. Naito, and N.

In budding yeast, IP6 synthesis occurs through the sequential phosphorylation of I(1,4,5)P3 by two gene products, Ipk2 and Ipk1, a IP3/IP4 dual-specificity 6-/3-kinase and an inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase, respectively. Here we report the identification and characterization of two inositol polyphosphate kinases from Arabidopsis thaliana, designated AtIpk2α and AtIpk2β that are encoded by distinct genes on chromosome 5 and that are ubiquitously expressed in mature tissue. The primary structures of AtIpk2α and AtIpk2β are 70% identical to each other and 12–18% identical to Ipk2s from yeast and mammals. Similar to yeast Ipk2, purified recombinant AtIpk2α and AtIpk2β have 6-/3-kinase activities that sequentially phosphorylate I(1,4,5)P3 to generate I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 predominantly via an I(1,4,5,6)P4 intermediate. While I(1,3,4,5)P4is a substrate for the plant Ipk2s, it does not appear to be a detectable product of the IP3 reaction. Additionally, we report that the plant and yeast Ipk2 have a novel 5-kinase activity toward I(1,3,4,6)P4 and I(1,2,3,4,6)P5, which would allow these proteins to participate in at least two proposed pathways in the synthesis of IP6. Heterologous expression of either plant isoform in an ipk2 mutant yeast strain restores IP4 and IP5 production in vivo and rescues its temperature-sensitive growth defects.

As an asymmetric cyclitol harboring six hydroxyls, myo-inositol is a scaffold that has the potential to transduce a wealth of information through the combinatorial addition of phosphates. One such intracellular messenger, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3),1 which is a product of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis by phospholipase C, has been extensively characterized for its ability to specifically stimulate calcium release from intracellular stores (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). IP3 also serves as a precursor to the synthesis of over 15 water-soluble IPs including higher phosphorylated species such as inositol tetrakisphosphate (IP4), inositol pentakisphosphate (IP5), and inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6), which have recently been implicated as messengers regulating processes such as mRNA export, transcription, DNA repair, channel activity, and membrane trafficking (reviewed in Refs. 2Majerus P.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 225-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholarand 3Irvine R.V. Schell M.J. Nature Reviews. 2001; 2: 327-338Crossref Scopus (542) Google Scholar). In addition, IP6 has been suggested as a reservoir for the synthesis of the diphosphoryl class of inositol polyphosphates (referred to as PP-IPs and in some cases IP7 and IP8) the functions of which are currently under investigation (4Shears S.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 49-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 5Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24686-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In plants, higher inositol polyphosphates, which are generally defined as IPs with four or more phosphates, likely share similar signaling roles as in other eukaryotes, but they also serve a specialized function in seeds as storage pools of inositol, phosphate, and mineral nutrients (6Raboy V. Gerbasi P. Subcell. Biochem. 1996; 26: 257-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7Loewus F.A. Murthy P.P.N. Plant Science. 2000; 150: 1-19Crossref Scopus (521) Google Scholar). During seed development, IP6, also known as phytate, accumulates in storage protein bodies as mixed salts of various minerals such as iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, manganese, and zinc (6Raboy V. Gerbasi P. Subcell. Biochem. 1996; 26: 257-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8Raboy V. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 458-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In this form phytate often represents more than 1% of the dry weight of seeds (9Raboy V. Morre D.J. Boss W.F. Loewus F.A. Inositol Metabolism in Plants. Wiley-Liss, Inc., 1990: 55-76Google Scholar). During germination, the phytate-containing storage protein bodies are disassembled, and the IP6 is rapidly hydrolyzed by phytases (6Raboy V. Gerbasi P. Subcell. Biochem. 1996; 26: 257-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7Loewus F.A. Murthy P.P.N. Plant Science. 2000; 150: 1-19Crossref Scopus (521) Google Scholar) releasing stored nutrients to the developing seedling before the plant is capable of absorbing them from the immediate environment. Ironically, the very properties that make phytate beneficial to the plant cause it to be an antinutrient to the animal that consumes it. The high concentration of phytate in food grains and its ability to chelate mineral cations and resistance to animal digestion compromises mineral absorption. Undigested phytate in animal waste also contributes to eutrophication and environmental phosphorus pollution (8Raboy V. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 458-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). For these reasons, there is significant interest in altering phytate production in agriculturally significant plants. Currently, very little is known about the genetics of phytate production in plants through either lipid dependent or independent pathways (8Raboy V. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 458-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Biochemically, I(1,4,5)P3, I(1,3,4,5)P4, and I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 kinase activities have been described in pea roots and immature soybean seeds, respectively, (10Chattaway J.A. Drobak B.K. Watkins P.A.C.

Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 291-297Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but none of the corresponding genes have been identified. Several studies have indicated that IP6 may also be synthesized in lipid-independent pathways directly from inositol and/or inositol 3-phosphate (13Stephens L.R. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1990; 346: 580-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 14Brearley C.A. Hanke D.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Despite this, only one IP kinase from any plant species has been cloned and thisArabidopsis gene product has I(1,3,4)P35/6-kinase activity (15Wilson M.P. Majerus P.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recently a pathway for IP6 synthesis has been delineated in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae through a phospholipase C-dependent pathway in which IP3is sequentially phosphorylated to IP6 by the products of two genes, IPK2 and IPK1 (16York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 17Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D. Science. 2000; 287: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Ipk2 is a dual-specificity IP3/IP4 6-/3-kinase that generates IP5 from IP3 (17Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D. Science. 2000; 287: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 18Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and Ipk1 is an I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 2-kinase (16York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). When either of these two genes is dysfunctional in yeast, IP6 is no longer synthesized (16York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 17Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D. Science. 2000; 287: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Here we report that the plant A. thaliana has two genes that encode IP3/IP4kinases, and characterization of their substrate specificities suggests that they have the potential to participate in multiple pathways of IP6 synthesis. Yeast strains (described in TableI) were grown in complete minimal medium containing the appropriate amino acids, 2% glucose, and lacking uracil to maintain selection for URA3 plasmids.

Arabidopsis cDNA was synthesized as previously described (20Stevenson J.M. Perera I.Y. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22761-22767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and the coding sequences of AtIPK2α andAtIPK2β were amplified by PCR using 25 pmol of each primer with the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The sense primers contained 5′-NcoI restriction sites and the antisense primers contained 5′-SalI sites. The primers used for AtIPK2α were: sense, 5′-AA ACC ATG GCG ATG CAG CTC AAA GTC CCT GAA CAT CAG G-3′ and antisense, 5′-AA AGT CGA CCT AAG AAT CTG CAG ACT CAT CTG GGC TCT G-3′. The primers for amplification of AtIPK2β were: sense, 5′-AA ACC ATG GCG ATG CTC AAG GTC CCT GAA CAC CAA GTT G-3′ and antisense, 5′-AA AGT CGA CCT AGC GCC CGT TCT CAA GTA GGG AAG-3′. The 861 and 903 bp PCR products representing AtIPK2α andAtIPK2β cDNA, respectively, were subcloned into pCR-Blunt (Invitrogen) and used to transform competent TOP10 Escherichia coli. Purified plasmids from positive transformants were sequenced by the ABI Prism dGTP Big Dye Terminator Ready Reaction kit (PE BioSystems) to verify the integrity of the cDNA. The cDNAs were then individualy ligated in-frame with a Lox recombination site in pUNI-10 (21Liu Q., Li, M.Z. Leibham D. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1300-1309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with the sequence for glutathione S-transferase (GST) in the bacterial expression vector, pGEX-KG, a modified version of pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences), kindly provided by Danny Lew, Duke University. The pUNI-10 vectors carrying the AtIPK2α and AtIPK2β cDNAs were recombined by in vitro site-specific recombination with a pLox/MYC3/URA3/CEN yeast host vector (pRS316), resulting in centromeric URA3 plasmids with amino-terminal MYC-tagged AtIPK2α or AtIPK2β driven by the CUP1 copper-inducible promoter. These yeast expression vectors carrying the Arabidopsis cDNAs were designated pRSAtIPK2α and pRSAtIPK2β and were used to transform various S. cerevisiae IP kinase mutants identified in Table I. PCR mutagenesis was used to generate a point mutation in the conserved DXKXG motif of IP kinases. Mutations in this region have been shown to ablate IP kinase activity of Ipk2 (17Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D. Science. 2000; 287: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The mutation site for AtIPK2α was D98A and forAtIPK2β was D100A. Complementary PCR primers were designed to anneal to the region to be mutated and were identical to the cDNA except for the single nucleotide change in the aspartic acid codon changing it to an alanine codon. The primers forAtIPK2α were as follows: sense, 5′-TCA GTA ATG GCT GTT AAG ATG-3′ and antisense, 5′-AGT CAT TAC CGA CAA TTC TAC-3′ where the nucleotide in italics identifies the point mutation. The primers for AtIPK2β were as follows: sense, 5′-CG GTA ATG GCT GTT AAG ATT G-3′ and antisense, 5′-GC CAT TAC CGA CAA TTC TAA C-3′. These primers were used in combination with the primers used to amplify the full open reading frames described above. The PCR reactions were performed using Turbo Pfu high fidelity polymerase (Stratagene) and the conditions suggested by the manufacturer. Two independent reactions for each mutation generated PCR products that were gel purified and used in a subsequent PCR reaction that contained only the primers that amplified from the ends of the full-length open reading frame of the cDNA. The result of this amplification was a full-length cDNA with a single point mutation. The PCR product was digested with NcoI and SalI, ligated into pUNI-10 and pGEX-KG, and analyzed for correct sequence. To verify that the mutations rendered the enzyme inactive, we expressed the mutated AtIpk2α and AtIpk2β as GST fusion proteins in bacteria and purified and assayed them for I(1,4,5)P3 kinase activity as described below for assays with [3H]I(1,4,5)P3 as the substrate. 100 ng of either of the purified mutated recombinant proteins were completely unable to phosphorylate I(1,4,5)P3 in vitro(data not shown). The AtIPK2α- andAtIPK2β-pGEX-KG plasmids were each used to transform competent DH5α E. coli cells. One liter of LB was inoculated with a 20-ml overnight culture of DH5α cells carrying the AtIPK2α-pGEX-KG orAtIPK2β-pGEX-KG plasmid and grown at 37 °C to an absorbance of 0.6 at 600 nm. Expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (final concentration). The cells were grown for 4 h at 37 °C, harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, and resuspended in 20 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors. The cells were frozen at −20 °C, thawed on ice, and lysed by 5 passages through a cell cracker (a high shear fluid processing system for cell rupture, Microfluidics Corp.). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and Triton X-100 were added to final concentrations of 1 mm and 1%, respectively. The lysate was subjected to centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then incubated with 1 ml of a 50% glutathione-Sepharose slurry (Amersham Biosciences) for 15 min at 25 °C with shaking. The Sepharose was washed three times with 50 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the GST fusion proteins were eluted from the Sepharose with 1 ml of 10 mm reduced glutathione in 30 mm Tris, pH 7.5 and stored at −80 °C in aliquots. All unlabeled IPs were purchased from Cell Signals, Inc. except for I(1,3,4,6)P4, which was purchased from Inositols.com. Tritiated IPs were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences except for [3H]I(1,3,4,6)P4 and [3H]I(1,2,3,4,6)P5, which were generated as follows. To synthesize [3H]I(1,3,4,6)P4, [3H]I(1,3,4)P3 was phosphorylated by 100 ng of recombinant mammalian I(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 14 mm phosphocreatine, 0.5 units of phosphocreatine kinase, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 150 ng of inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (to avoid I(1,3,4,5)P4 synthesis) for 60 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by heat inactivation at 100 °C for 1 min. To synthesize [3H]I(1,2,3,4,6)P5, [3H]I(1,3,4,6)P4 was incubated with 100 ng of an IP4 2-kinase 2J. Stevenson-Paulik, R. A. Frye, and J. D. York, manuscript in preparation. under the same conditions as described above. For assays using tritiated substrates, 50–100 ng of purified recombinant GST-AtIpk2α or GST-AtIpk2β were incubated independently with 0.25–20 μm [3H]inositol, [3H]I(1)P, [3H]I(1,4)P2, [3H]I(1,4,5)P3, [3H]I(1,3,4,5)P4, or [3H]I(1,3,4,6)P4 for designated times at 37 °C in buffer containing 1 mm ATP, 50 mmHepes pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2. 10-μl reactions were stopped by the addition of 30 times the reaction volume of 10 mmNH4H2PO4 and analyzed by Partisphere strong anion exchange HPLC. To determine whether the IP4 product of I(1,4,5)P3 phosphorylation was I(1,3,4,5)P4 or I(1,4,5,6)P4, 100 ng of GST-AtIpk2α and GST-AtIpk2β were incubated with 10 μm[3H]I(1,4,5)P3 as described above for 10 min at 37 °C so that the majority of the product was IP4 and not IP5. Half of the reaction was terminated by the addition of 300 μl of 10 mmNH4H2PO4, and the other half was incubated with 50 ng of purified recombinant type I inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase for another 10 min at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated and analyzed by HPLC over a Partisphere Sax strong anion exchange column (4.6 × 125 mm) and a linear gradient from 10 mm to 1.7 mNH4H2PO4 (pH 3.5) over 12 min, followed by elution for 25 min with 1.7 mNH4H2PO4. IPs were identified based on comparison to the elution of known IP species. To test if AtIpk2α and AtIpk2β phosphorylated a range of different IPs, 1.4 μg of recombinant GST- AtIpk2α and GST- AtIpk2β were individually incubated with 10 μm I(1,4,5)P3, I(1,3,4)P3, I(1,2,6)P3, I(1,4,5,6)P4, I(1,3,4,5)P4, I(3,4,5,6)P4, I(1,3,4,6)P4, I(1,3,4,5,6)P5, or IP6 in 50 mmHepes pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, and trace concentrations of [γ-32P]ATP (200,000 cpm) for 30 min at 37 °C. The 10-μl reaction was either quenched by the addition of 300 μl 10 mm NH4H2PO4, or MgATP was added to a final concentration of 1 mm ATP and 5 mm MgCl2 and the reaction was again incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Quenched reactions were analyzed by HPLC as described above. S. cerevisiae cells carrying either pRS316 alone, pRSAtIPK2α, or pRSAtIPK2β were grown in 1 ml of complete minimal medium lacking uracil and containing 100 μm CuSO4 and 40 μCi [3H]inositol to late logarithmic phase. The cells were harvested and the soluble lysate containing the IPs was isolated according to York et al. (16York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Tissue for RNA isolation was harvested from the leaves, stems, roots, siliques, and flowers of 3–4-week-old A. thaliana plants (ecotype Columbia). Total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's recommendations using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA samples were treated with DNase I to remove any contaminating genomic DNA. An oligo(dT) primer (5′-T27VN-3′) was annealed to the RNA at 70 °C for 5 min with subsequent cooling to room temperature for 30 min. Reverse transcription of 1 μg of RNA occurred at 37 °C for 1 h in a reaction mix containing 200 units of MMLV reverse transcriptase (Promega), 1× MMLV reaction buffer, 1 mm dNTPs, 500 ng of oligo(dT) primer, and 40 units of RNase inhibitor. The reactions were stopped by heat inactivation at 70 °C for 10 min. The subsequent PCR reactions contained one-fourth of the first strand cDNA, 12.5 μm of the sense and antisense primers for each gene, 1×Taq polymerase reaction buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.6 mm dNTPs, and 0.25 units ofTaq polymerase. The reactions were incubated at 94 °C for an initial 4 min and then cycled 30 times (non-saturating conditions of target DNA amplification) at 94 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The primers used were designed to amplify the entire open reading frames of AtIPK2α,AtIPK2β, and ACT2 (GenBankTMaccession U41998). As a control to test for contaminating genomic DNA, PCR reactions were performed as described above directly from the RNA samples. The primers for AtIPK2α were 5′-TGC AGC TCA AAG TCC CTG AAC ATC AGG TT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCT GCA GAC TCA TCT GGG CTC GTA AGA AT-3′ (antisense). The primers for AtIPK2β were 5′-TGC TCA AGG TCC CTG AAC ACC AAG TTG CT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTT CTC AAG TAG GGA AGT ATC GGT TTC AT-3′ (antisense). The primers used to amplifyACT2 were 5′-ATG GCT GAG GCT GAT GAT ATT CAA C-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGT GAA CGA TTC CTG GAC CTG CCT C-3′ (antisense). The motif PxxxDxKxG is conserved among a growing family of inositol polyphosphate kinases. This motif was originally described as common to IP3 3-kinases, and subsequently it was shown by several research groups to be a hallmark of a protein family, whose members include IP3 3-kinases, IP3/IP4dual-specificity 6-/3-kinases (also known as Ipk2 or Ipmk), and diphosphoryl IP synthases (also known as IP6K) (5Saiardi A.

Interestingly, this motif is not found in IP kinases that phosphorylate the axial D-2 position of the inositol ring (16York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 27Ives E.B. Nichols J. Wente S.R. York J.D. J. Biol.

Commun. 1997; 232: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 28Wilson M.P. Majerus P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11904-11910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In order to identify plant orthologs, we pattern searched the Arabidopsis genome for this motif using the PatMatch program provided by the TAIRArabidopsis data base. We found two candidate sequences, GenBankTM accession AJ404678 and AJ245521 harboring the sequence PsvmDvKmG and PsvmDvKiG respectively. Pair-wise comparison of the two putative IP kinases reveals that they are 70% identical and 78% similar to each other at the level of primary structure. The predicted sequences of AJ404678 and AJ245521 are 12–18% identical and 25–28% similar to S. cerevisiae Ipk2 and rat inositol polyphosphate multikinase (rIpmk), which are characterized dual-specificity IP3/IP4 kinases. When the plant, yeast, and rat sequences are aligned with other members of the kinase family, five motifs emerge that are highly conserved (Fig.1). The second motif contains the canonical PxxxDxKxG sequence and is the putative IP binding site (29Togashi S. Takazawa K. Endo T. Erneux C. Onaya T. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Next we analyzed the substrate selectivity of purified recombinantAJ404678 and AJ245521 expressed as GST fusion proteins. The three types of IP kinases in this family are distinguishable by analysis of the reaction products using two substrates I(1,4,5)P3 and IP6. When either recombinant fusion protein was incubated with [3H]I(1,4,5)P3 and ATP, the product was I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 through an IP4 intermediate (Fig. 2). This result indicated that the plant kinases fall into the dual-specificity class harboring IP3/IP4 kinase activity analogous to theS. cerevisiae Ipk2 and rat Ipmk. When tested for kinase activity using IP6 (or IP5) neither recombinant protein produced detectable diphosphoryl IP products. Therefore, we have designated AJ404678 and AJ245521 as AtIpk2α and AtIpk2β, respectively. Others (18Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 30Nalaskowski M.M. Deschermeier C. Fanick W. Mayr G.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) have reported that the mammalian and yeast Ipk2 generate I(1,3,4,5)P4 as a reaction product. Thus, we determined the nature of the IP4 intermediate in the plant IP3 to IP5 reaction. To test this, we used the type I inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase, which is known to remove the D-5 position phosphate from I(1,3,4,5)P4 and I(1,4,5)P3 but not I(1,4,5,6)P4. Recombinant AtIpk2α and AtIpk2β were incubated with IP3 and stopped when the IP4 intermediate was maximal (time of 10 min as shown in Fig. 2 B) at which point recombinant type I 5-phosphatase was added. As seen in Fig.3 A, 5-phosphatase treatment does not hydrolyze IP4 isomer(s) generated by either AtIpk2α or AtIpk2β. The 5-phosphatase was active in these reactions because it completely dephosphorylated the remaining I(1,4,5)P3 substrate to I(1,4)P2 (Fig.3 A), and in the control reaction it readily hydrolyzed [3H]I(1,3,4,5)P4 to generate I(1,3,4)P3 (Fig. 3 B). We previously published similar results using this method for yeast Ipk2 (16York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Given the Shears report of yeast Ipk2 (18Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we retested recombinant GST-Ipk2 in these experiments and found that, like AtIpk2α and AtIpk2β, yeast Ipk2 synthesizes I(1,4,5,6)P4 as the major product of IP3 phosphorylation (data not shown). Multiple substrate specificities have been described for members of the IP kinase family, therefore, we tested a panel of available IPs as possible substrates. The recombinant proteins were individually testedin vitro for the ability to phosphorylate a panel of fourteen different inositol species as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Detectable activity was observed using I(1,4,5)P3, I(1,4,5,6)P4, I(1,3,4,5)P4, I(1,3,4,6)P4, I(1,2,3,4,6)P5. As expected, AtIpk2α and AtIpk2β phosphorylated I(1,4,5)P3 to IP4 (Fig.4, A and C) and with the addition of unlabeled ATP after the initial incubation with trace [γ-32P]ATP, each enzyme additionally phosphorylated the IP4 product to I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 (Fig. 4, B and D). The plant IP kinases also phosphorylated I(1,4,5,6)P4 (Fig. 4,E and G) as well as I(1,3,4,5)P4(Fig. 4, F and H). Surprisingly, AtIpk2α and AtIpk2β were able to phosphorylate I(1,3,4,6)P4 and (1,2,3,4,6)P5 on the D-5 position to generate I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 and IP6, respectively (Fig.5). To our knowledge, this 5-kinase activity has not been described previously for any mem"

Several cardiovascular diseases are characterized by a state of excess oxidative stress associated with enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; VSMCs, vascular smooth muscle cells; EGF, epidermal growth factor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; DN, dominant negative. within the arterial wall. ROS including superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radical are generated in a variety of cells stimulated with cytokines, growth factors, and agonists of G-protein-coupled receptors and are important chemical mediators that regulate signal transduction. Because it has recently become clear that ROS may mediate specific cellular functions such as cell growth, hypertrophy, and apoptosis, understanding the intracellular signaling of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) induced by ROS should provide further insight into the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases (1Abe J.

J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15926-15932Google Scholar). ROS also activate certain proliferation-associated signaling pathways such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (12Frank G.D. Eguchi S. Yamakawa T. Tanaka S. Inagami T. Motley E.D. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3120-3126Google Scholar) and Akt (13Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Yin Q. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Griendling K.K. J. Biol.

Commun. 2001; 280: 1116-1119Google Scholar, 14Ushio-Fukai M. Griendling K.K. Becker P.L. Hilenski L. Halleran S. Alexander R.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 489-495Google Scholar). Moreover, PDGF has long been implicated in atherosclerosis, and the PDGF receptor stimulation leads to potent proliferation and migration of VSMCs (15Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Google Scholar, 16Schwartz S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: S87-S89Google Scholar, 17Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Google Scholar). Therefore, the activation of PDGF receptor by ROS could specifically be involved in vascular remodeling associated with cardiovascular diseases. It has been reported that ROS such as H2O2induces tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, which is strongly potentiated by a combination treatment with vanadate. The mechanism was believed to be attributed in part to the inhibition of tyrosine phosphatase or activation of tyrosine kinase or both (18Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism by which ROS induce PDGF receptor activation remains unknown. PDGF initially activates the intrinsic tyrosine kinase of the receptors, leading to their dimerization and autophosphorylation. Many Src homology 2-containing proteins such as Ras-GTPase-activating protein, phospholipase C-γ (PLCγ), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Grb-2 bind to specific tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the activated PDGF receptor (19Heldin C.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 17-21Google Scholar). Among these proteins, PLCγ is an enzyme that produces inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol. These hydrolysis byproducts of PLCγ mobilize Ca2+ from intracellular stores and activate protein kinase C (PKC), respectively (20Carpenter G. Ji Q. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 15-24Google Scholar). PLCγ binds to phosphorylated Tyr1021 in the C-terminal tail of the PDGFβ receptor, and the activation of PLCγ is involved in both cell growth and chemotaxis in certain circumstances (19Heldin C.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 17-21Google Scholar). In this study, we explored the mechanisms involved in the activation of PDGFβ receptor by H2O2 stimulation in VSMCs. We found that H2O2 enhances the Tyr1021 phosphorylation of PDGFβ receptor distinct from the ligand-dependent manner. Furthermore, the activation of non-receptor kinases, c-Src and PKCδ, and their complex formation are required for H2O2-induced PDGFβ receptor activation. Taken together, our findings indicate that H2O2 activates the PDGFβ receptor via signal transduction pathways utilizing Src and PKCδ, and the requirement of c-Src/PKCδ distinguishes H2O2-induced PDGFβ receptor activation from the ligand-induced activation by the autophosphorylation mechanism in VSMCs. The activation of this particular signaling pathway involved in the regulation of cell growth and migration may explain the significance of ROS in cardiovascular diseases.

Cell lysates or immune complex were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (23Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, results are representative of at least three separated experiments yielding similar results. To determine whether H2O2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFβ receptor is similar to the ligand-dependent phosphorylation, the effects of H2O2 or PDGF-BB on Tyr1021phosphorylation of PDGFβ receptor were studied. 20 μmH2O2 increased Tyr1021phosphorylation of PDGFβ receptor within 3 min, peaked at 10 min, and sustained the phosphorylation up to 30 min (Fig.1 A). In contrast, PDGF-BB caused rapid Tyr1021 phosphorylation of PDGFβ receptor as early as 1 min and sustained the phosphorylation up to 10 min (Fig. 1 B). When the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PDGFβ receptor antibody and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, H2O2 also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFβ receptor maximally at 10–30 min. Moreover, H2O2 enhanced PLCγ association with the PDGFβ receptor in a similar time course as the H2O2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFβ receptor (Fig. 1 C). Because several G-protein-coupled receptors induce trans-activation of the EGF receptor through metalloprotease-dependent generation of its ligand (24Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Google Scholar, 25Kalmes A. Vesti B.R. Daum G. Abraham J.A. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 92-98Google Scholar, 26Eguchi S. Dempsey P.J. Frank G.D.

Chem. 2001; 276: 23155-23160Google Scholar), we determined the role of metalloprotease in H2O2-induced PDGFβ receptor phosphorylation. Treatment with metalloprotease inhibitors, BB2116 or CGS27023, did not alter tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFβ receptor by H2O2. In contrast, both BB2116 and CGS27023 strongly inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor induced by H2O2 (Fig.2). To evaluate whether PDGFβ receptor kinase activity contributes to the tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFβ receptor induced by H2O2, we used AG1295, a potent and selective inhibitor of this kinase (28Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Google Scholar). AG1295 (12.5–50 μm) strongly inhibited PDGF-BB-induced Tyr1021 phosphorylation of PDGFβ receptor in VSMCs (Fig.3 A). In contrast, AG1295 had no significant effect on H2O2-induced Tyr1021 phosphorylation of the PDGFβ receptor (Fig.3 B). Also, AG1295 did not alter H2O2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβ receptor when the receptor was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (data not shown). Previous studies have shown that H2O2 induces tyrosine phosphorylation and prolonged activation of PKCδ (29Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11233-11237Google Scholar), a member of the novel PKC subgroup that is abundant in VSMCs (30Fukumoto S. Nishizawa Y. Hosoi M. Koyama H. Yamakawa K. Ohno S. Morii H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13816-13822Google Scholar). To determine whether PKCδ is involved in H2O2-mediated phosphorylation of the PDGFβ receptor, we used rottlerin, a selective PKCδ inhibitor (31Gschwendt M. Muller H.J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated the specificity of this inhibitor in cultured rat VSMCs (6Frank G.D. Saito S. Motley E.D. Sasaki T. Ohba M. Inagami T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 367-377Google Scholar). Rottlerin inhibited H2O2-induced Tyr1021phosphorylation of the PDGFβ receptor, whereas Go6976, a PKCα and PKCβ isoform inhibitor, did not alter H2O2-induced Try1021phosphorylation of the PDGFβ receptor. Similar inhibition by rottlerin but not by Go6976 was observed in the immunoprecipitation of the PDGFβ receptor combined with immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. In contrast, rottlerin had no effect on PDGF-BB-mediated PDGFβ receptor tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig.4, A and B). To confirm the involvement of the PKCδ isoform in H2O2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβ receptor in VSMCs, dominant negative (DN) mutant of PKCδ was expressed using an adenovirus vector. We have performed control studies showing that the transfection of adenovirus of up to 100 multiplicity of infection (plaque-forming unit/cells) had no nonspecific effects on VSMCs by using an adenovirus vector encoding LacZ (6Frank G.D. Saito S. Motley E.D. Sasaki T. Ohba M. Inagami T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 367-377Google Scholar). The infection of VSMCs with DN-PKCδ adenovirus inhibited Tyr1021phosphorylation of PDGFβ receptor induced by H2O2 but not by PDGF-BB (Fig.5). To further explore the possibility that PKCδ may associate with the PDGFβ receptor in response to H2O2, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. When H2O2-stimulated cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PDGFβ receptor antibody and immunoblotted with anti-PKCδ antibody, PKCδ was detected in the PDGFβ receptor immunoprecipitates. In the reciprocal experiments, PDGFβ receptor was detected in anti-PKCδ immunoprecipitates from H2O2-stimulated VSMCs (Fig.6). These data suggest that H2O2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβ receptor requires the activation of PKCδ and its association with the PDGFβ receptor.Figure 5Effect of DN-PKCδ overexpression on H2O2- and PDGF-BB-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGF β receptor. VSMCs were infected with DN-PKCδ adenovirus at 100 m.o.i. (plaque-forming unit/cell) for 48 h. The cells were stimulated with 20 μm H2O2 or 50 ng/ml PDGF-BB and immunoblotted (IB) with anti-phospho-Tyr1021 PDGFβ receptor, anti-PDGFβ receptor antibody, and anti-PKCδ antibody. The extent of PDGFβ receptor tyrosine phosphorylation was quantified by densitometry.

Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21003-21010Google Scholar, 7Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Google Scholar). To determine the role of Src family kinases in H2O2-induced PDGFβ receptor activation, we used PP2, a pyrazolopyrimidine that interacts specifically with Src family kinases together with PP3, a negative control for PP2 (32Dowler S. Montalvo L. Cantrell D. Morrice N. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 605-610Google Scholar, 33Sanna P.P. Berton F. Cammalleri M. Tallent M.K. Siggins G.R. Bloom F.E. Francesconi W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8653-8657Google Scholar). PP2 but not PP3 completely inhibited H2O2-induced Tyr1021phosphorylation of the PDGFβ receptor in VSMCs (Fig.7). These data suggest that H2O2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFβ receptor is mediated by Src kinase activation. PKCδ has been shown to become tyrosine-phosphorylated in COS-7 cells exposed to H2O2 (29Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11233-11237Google Scholar). Also, PKCδ can be tyrosine-phosphorylated by the Src family kinases (34Joseloff E. Cataisson C. Aamodt H. Ocheni H. Blumberg P. Kraker A.J. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12318-12323Google Scholar, 35Benes C. Soltoff S.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1498-C1510Google Scholar, 36Song J.S. Swann P.G. Szallasi Z. Blank U. Blumberg P.M. Rivera J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3357-3368Google Scholar). Thus, we determined whether PKCδ was phosphorylated on tyrosine by H2O2 stimulation in VSMCs. H2O2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ was initially detected at 3 min and continued up to 10 min (Fig.8 A). H2O2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ was inhibited by pretreatment with PP2 but not with PP3 (Fig.8 B). We further examined the activation of c-Src and its possible association with PKCδ in response to H2O2. Previous studies showed that full catalytic activity of c-Src requires phosphorylation at Tyr418 (37Pawson T. Nature. 1997; 385: 582-585Google Scholar). We found that H2O2stimulated Tyr418 phosphorylation of c-Src as early as 3 min, peaking at 5 min, whereas it decreased at 10 min. Also, H2O2 stimulated a prominent increase in the association of PKCδ with c-Src in VSMCs. The complex formation between PKCδ and c-Src was detected within 3 min and plateaued by 5 min (Fig. 8 C). These data indicate that the activation of c-Src and its association with PKCδ by H2O2may lead to the activation of PKCδ and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβ receptor in VSMCs. The principal findings of this study are that H2O2 stimulates Tyr1021phosphorylation of the PDGFβ receptor in VSMCs and that this phosphorylation requires the activation of two protein kinases, PKCδ and c-Src, but not the intrinsic kinase activity of the PDGFβ receptor. These findings will provide new mechanistic insights by which enhanced ROS production in VSMCs induces unique alleys of signal transduction distinct from those induced by endogenous ligands leading to an abnormal vascular remodeling process. In this study, we have shown that H2O2stimulates phosphorylation of the PDGFβ receptor on Tyr residues, one of which was identified as Tyr1021 in VSMCs. These results are in good agreement with a recent publication (38Escargueil-Blanc I. Salvayre R. Vacaresse N. Jurgens G. Darblade B. Arnal J.F. Parthasarathy S. Negre-Salvayre A. Circulation. 2001; 104: 1814-1821Google Scholar) showing that H2O2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβ receptor as well. Also, our finding is further supported by the fact that PLCγ is recruited to the PDGFβ receptor after H2O2 stimulation and because Tyr1021 phosphorylation is known to provide a high affinity binding site for PLCγ (19Heldin C.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 17-21Google Scholar) Trans-activation of growth factor receptors such as EGF or PDGF receptor by stimuli that do not directly interact with the receptor is a current exciting topic of signal transduction research. Recently, an attractive mechanism for the trans-activation of the EGF receptor was discovered. This mechanism involves metalloprotease-dependent production of a mature ligand from its precursor (24Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Google Scholar, 25Kalmes A. Vesti B.R. Daum G. Abraham J.A. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 92-98Google Scholar, 26Eguchi S. Dempsey P.J. Frank G.D. Motley E.D. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7957-7962Google Scholar, 27Pierce K.L. Tohgo A. Ahn S. Field M.E. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23155-23160Google Scholar). Although the ligands for the PDGFβ receptor expressed in VSMCs do not require this metalloprotease-dependent step to become an active ligand, VSMCs may also express a newly identified ligand for PDGF receptors such as PDGF-C or PDGF-D. The proform of these ligands contains a proteolytic cleavage site (39Heldin C.H. Eriksson U. Ostman A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 398: 284-290Google Scholar). Because we have shown that angiotensin II-induced EGF receptor trans-activation requires both ROS production and a metalloprotease-dependent ligand production (10Frank G.D. Eguchi S. Inagami T. Motley E.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 1116-1119Google Scholar, 26Eguchi S. Dempsey P.J. Frank G.D. Motley E.D. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7957-7962Google Scholar), we examined whether a metalloprotease function is required for PDGFβ receptor or EGF receptortrans-activation by H2O2 in this study. We confirmed that EGF receptor trans-activation by H2O2 requires a metalloprotease in this study; however, PDGFβ receptor activation appears to be independent from this mechanism. Because the ligand-independent activation of this tyrosine kinase receptor may not lead to activation of intrinsic tyrosine kinase, we further asked whether the Tyr1021 phosphorylation of PDGFβ receptor requires its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity by using a selective PDGF receptor kinase inhibitor, AG1295. Our results clearly demonstrate that AG1295 markedly inhibits PDGF-BB-induced Tyr1021 phosphorylation of the PDGFβ receptor but not the phosphorylation induced by H2O2. These data further confirm that the H2O2-induced PDGFβ receptor activation is ligand-independent and suggest that the Tyr1021 phosphorylation of PDGFβ receptor might involve the inhibition of tyrosine phosphatase as previously proposed (18Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Google Scholar) or the activation of other tyrosine kinases, which may phosphorylate the receptor. PKCδ is one of the PKC isoforms shown to be activated by H2O2 and is abundant in VSMCs (29Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11233-11237Google Scholar, 30Fukumoto S. Nishizawa Y. Hosoi M. Koyama H. Yamakawa K. Ohno S. Morii H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13816-13822Google Scholar). We have previously shown the requirement of PKCδ in mediating the activation of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, PYK2 and JAK2, by angiotensin II in VSMCs and thereby established the specificities of PKCδ inhibitors, rottlerin and a dominant negative adenovirus, used in this study (6Frank G.D. Saito S. Motley E.D. Sasaki T. Ohba M. Inagami T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 367-377Google Scholar). Here, we have shown for the first time that PKCδ is indispensable for H2O2-induced but not PDGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFβ receptor in VSMCs. This is further supported by the fact that there is an inducible complex formation between PKCδ and the PDGFβ receptor in response to H2O2. It has been shown that H2O2 induces the association between PKCα and the PDGF receptor in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (40Min D.S. Kim E.-G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29986-29994Google Scholar). Although we did not measure the PKCα association in this study, the participation of PKCα in H2O2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβ receptor is unlikely because of the results using a PKCα and PKCβ inhibitors. We have previously shown that the inhibitor at the concentration used in this study is effective for the PKCα-dependent event in VSMCs that was further confirmed by overexpression of wild type PKCα in VSMCs (41Motley E.D. Kabir S.M. Gardner C.D. Eguchi K. Frank G.D. Kuroki T. Ohba M. Yamakawa T. Eguchi S. Hypertension. 2002; 39: 508-512Google Scholar). This study suggests the involvement of c-Src in H2O2- induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβ receptor in VSMCs. Because PP2 inhibits PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation, c-Src probably acts upstream of PKCδ-dependent PDGFβ receptor phosphorylation by ROS. However, a recent report using VSMCs showed that angiotensin II stimulates ROS-dependent PDGFβ receptor tyrosine phosphorylation that is insensitive to a Src kinase inhibitor PP1 (11Heeneman S. Haendeler J. Saito Y. Ishida M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15926-15932Google Scholar). This may be attributed to a different agonist (angiotensin II) used or an inhibitor for Src (PP1) used in the study. In conclusion, we demonstrated here that ROS induced a ligand-independent tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFβ receptor involving PKCδ and c-Src that is distinct from PDGF-induced PDGFβ receptor activation. Because both ROS and PDGF receptor signal transduction are strongly implicated in vascular diseases, our data add new mechanistic insight into these diseases associated with enhanced ROS action.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4342-4347Google Scholar). Several lines of investigation have led to the conclusion that AP2α is a tumor suppressor gene. Studies of primary breast tumors using immunohistochemistry demonstrated a progressive loss of AP2α expression with tumor progression from normal mammary epithelium, to DCIS, and to invasive cancer (15Gee J.M. Robertson J.F. Ellis I.O. Nicholson R.I. Hurst H.C. J. Pathol. 1999; 189: 514-520Google Scholar). Similar findings have been reported for colon carcinomas evaluated by immunohistochemistry, which demonstrated a decrease in AP2α expression in advanced Duke's stage carcinomas (16Ropponen K.M. Kellokoski J.K. Pirinen R.T. Moisio K.I. Eskelinen M.J. Alhava E.M. Kosma V.M. J. Clin. Pathol. 2001; 54: 533-538Google Scholar). Interestingly, there was an increase in AP2α mRNA in advanced stage colon tumors as determined by in situ hybridization indicating that the loss of AP2α was at the level of protein synthesis or stability. Loss of AP2α expression has also been reported to occur with malignant transformation and tumor progression in cutaneous malignant melanoma (17Karjalainen J.M. Kellokoski J.K. Eskelinen M.J. Alhava E.M. Kosma V.M. J. Clin. Oncol. 1998; 16: 3584-3591Google Scholar). Decreased AP2α expression was found to be independently associated with elevated risk of subsequent metastatic behavior of stage I cutaneous malignant melanoma. In cell culture models, AP2α has been reported to activate p21WAF1/CIP1 expression resulting in an inhibition of both cell division and stable colony formation (18Zeng Y.X. Somasundaram K. el-Deiry W.S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 78-82Google Scholar). Furthermore, a dominant-negative AP2α mutant has been shown to increase invasiveness and tumorigenicity (10Bar-Eli M. Pigment Cell Res. 2001; 14: 78-85Google Scholar, 19Gershenwald J.E. Sumner W. Calderone T. Wang Z. Huang S. Bar-Eli M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3363-3375Google Scholar, 20Bar-Eli M. Cancer Metast. Rev. 1999; 18: 377-385Google Scholar). These finding have been corroborated in studies of primary breast cancers and colorectal carcinomas, which demonstrated a significant correlation between AP2α and p21WAF1/CIP1 expression (15Gee J.M. Robertson J.F. Ellis I.O. Nicholson R.I. Hurst H.C. J. Pathol. 1999; 189: 514-520Google Scholar, 21Ropponen K.M. Kellokoski J.K. Lipponen P.K. Pietilainen T. Eskelinen M.J. Alhava E.M. Kosma V.M. Br.

We have identified a direct protein-protein interaction between AP2α and the p53 tumor suppressor protein. The interaction between AP2α and p53 was demonstrated in vitro by yeast two-hybrid and GST 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathioneS-transferase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; MOI, multiplicity of infection; Gy, Gray; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ERα, estrogen receptor α. pull-down and was confirmed in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation, co-localization and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Furthermore, ChIP analysis demonstrated that AP2α is targeted to the p53 binding sites in p53-regulated promoters. The interaction between AP2α and p53 resulted in an augmentation of p53-mediated transcriptional activation, which was evident by reporter assays and by induction of endogenous p21WAF1/CIP1 expression. Consistent with this finding was that AP2α induced G1 and G2 cell cycle arrest only in the presence of p53. We conclude that the tumor suppressor activity of AP2α is mediated through a direct interaction with p53. The interaction between AP2α and p53 provides a mechanism to explain patterns of gene expression in tumors where AP2α has been shown to act as a tumor suppressor. In initial library screening, the Human Mammary Gland MATCHMAKER cDNA library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used. To generate DNA-BD/AP2α, the coding region of AP2α was amplified from the SP(RSV)AP2 plasmid (Gift of Trevor Williams, University of Colorado) using the primers 5′-CGATCCATGCATATGCTTTGGAAATTGACG-3′ and 5′-GGGAGGGTCGACTCACTTTCTGTGCTTCTC-3′. AfterNdeI/SalI digestion, the PCR product was ligated into pGBKT7 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). To generate DNA-BD/AP2γ and AD/AP2γ, the full-length AP2γ coding region was amplified using the primers 5′-ACGCCGGACCATATGTTGTGGAAAATAACC-3′ and 5′-TCGTTGGATCCTTATTTCCTGTGTTTCTCC-3′ (for DNA-BD/AP2γ) or 5′-TCGTTCTCGAGTTATTTCCTGTGTTTCTCC-3′ (for AD/AP2γ). The PCR products were digested and ligated into the NdeI/BamHI site of pGBKT7 for DNA-BD/AP2γ and into theNdeI/XhoI site of pGADT7 (Clontech Inc.) for AD/AP2γ. DNA-BD/p53 and AD/T were obtained from Clontech Inc. Radiolabeled p53 was synthesized using T7 polymerase and the TnT-coupled transcription/translation kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The AP2α-GST fusion construct, AP2α/pGEX-4T-3, was made by PCR using primers 5′-CGATCCGTCGACATGCTTTGGAAATTGACG-3′ and 5′-GGGAGGGTCGACTCACTTTCTGTGCTTCTC-3′. After SalI digestion, the PCR fragment was ligated into pGEX-4T-3 (AmershamBiosciences). AP2γ/pGEX-4T-1 has been described previously (22McPherson L.A. Weigel R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4040-4049Google Scholar). The GST-p53 protein was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotecnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Fusion proteins were expressed in DH5α and purified by glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). 50 μg of GST or GST fusion proteins were incubated with 20 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 5 min at room temperature in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. The beads were washed four times with 500 μl of 1× phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with labeled p53 protein for 15 min at room temperature. The beads were washed, protein was eluted at room temperature for 5 min with glutathione elution buffer (10 mm reduced glutathione, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) and resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE. Preparation of MCF7 nuclear extract and gel-shift analysis were performed as previously described (22McPherson L.A. Weigel R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4040-4049Google Scholar). AP2α-specific antibody (C-18) and p53-specific antibodies (DO-1, FL-393, and Pab1801) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for supershift and/or immunoprecipitation. After immunoprecipitation, complexes were disrupted with 0.8 m KCl, and supernatant was assayed for AP2α. MCF7 or HCT116 p53−/− and p53+/+ cells (gift from Dr. Bert Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins University) (23Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Google Scholar) were plated on glass coverslips coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well in DMEM + 10% FCS. After 3 h, HCT116 cells were infected with either AdWT or AdAP2α (24Schuur E.R. McPherson L.A. Yang G.P. Weigel R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15519-15526Google Scholar) at a MOI of 10 for 1 h in Optimem-1 (Invitrogen). Virus was removed and replaced with 1 ml of DMEM + 10% FCS. After 24 h, cells were subjected to 6 Gy γ-radiation in a137Cs irradiator and incubated an additional 2 h prior to performing indirect immunofluorescence. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed on both MCF7 and HCT116 cells using primary antibodies for AP2α (C-18) and p53 (DO-1) diluted to 0.4 μg/ml and 2.4 μg/ml, respectively. Secondary antibodies Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugates (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were diluted 1:500 and incubated with the fixed cells for 45 min at room temperature. CV-1 cells were plated at 1.5 × 105/35-mm plate in DMEM + 10% FCS. Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 200 ng of pβGal-Control (Clontech), 200 ng of the p53 reporter PG13PyLUC (gift from Dr. Bert Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins University) (25Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Google Scholar), 200 ng of AP2α expression vector AP2α/pcDNA3.1 (22McPherson L.A. Weigel R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4040-4049Google Scholar), and either 0, 50, 100, or 200 ng of Rc/CMVhp53 or Rc/CMVhp53His175 (gifts from Dr. Bert Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins University) (25Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Google Scholar). Total amount of DNA transfected was equalized to 1 μg using salmon sperm DNA. Cell extracts were harvested at 24 h and assayed as previously described (22McPherson L.A. Weigel R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4040-4049Google Scholar). ChIP analysis of p21 promoter was performed as described (26Szak S.T. Mays D. Pietenpol J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3375-3386Google Scholar). HCT 116 p53+/+ or p53−/− cells were infected with Ad-AP2α and after 18 h were treated with 8 Gy γ-irradiation. Cells were harvested for ChIP 6 h after irradiation. Immunoprecipitation was performed with the anti-AP2α C-18 antibody, and primers for PCR amplification were 5′-CCTGCTTCCCAGGAACATGCTT and 5′-CTGCTGGCAGATCACATACCCTGT, which amplifies the region of the p21 promoter containing the p53 binding sites at −2250. HCT116 p53−/− and p53 +/+ cells were plated in DMEM + 10% FCS at 1 × 106 cells/35-mm dish and incubated overnight. Cells were infected with either AdWT or AdAP2α at an MOI of 10 for 1 h. Virus was removed, replaced with DMEM + 10% FCS, and incubated for 24 h. One set of cells was treated with 6 Gy γ-radiation, and both sets of cells were incubated an additional 24 h prior to RNA isolation. Primers for amplifying the 473 bp P21WAF1/CIP1 PCR fragment were 5′-GCACTCAGAGGAGGCGCCATGTC-3′ and 5′-GGTAGAAATCTGTCATGCTGGTCTGCCG-3′. Primers used to amplify the 191-bp GAPDH PCR fragment were 5′-CACATCGCTCAGACACCATG-3′ and 5′-GCCATGGAATTTGCCATGGG-3′. Phosphorimaging was performed on a Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA) phosphorimager, and quantitative values were obtained using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). HCT116 p53+/+ and p53−/− cells were infected with AdWT or AdAP2α and treated with γ-radiation. The AdWT and AdAP2α adenoviruses co-express green fluorescent protein (GFP) and ten thousand GFP-positive cells were analyzed from each sample on a FACStar flow cytometer for propidium iodide (PI) fluorescence. Cells were analyzed for cell cycle by PI staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting as previously described (27Schuur E.R. Loktev A.V. Sharma M. Sun Z. Roth R.A. Weigel R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33554-33560Google Scholar). Using untreated HCT116 p53−/− and HCT116 p53+/+ cells as a fingerprint for cell cycle, the percentage of cells in G1 and G2 was determined. In order to determine mechanisms of AP2 action, we used a yeast two-hybrid assay to identify factors that interact with AP2α. The full-length AP2α protein was cloned as a fusion with the Gal4 DNA binding domain (DNA-BD/AP2α) and was co-transfected with a human mammary cDNA library cloned as a fusion with the Gal4 activation domain. Approximately 2 × 105 yeast transformants were screened on selective media and 61 clones were confirmed to grow on S.D./-Leu/-Trp/-His/-Ade media. Inserts from the 61 clones were sequenced and four were found to encode the p53 tumor suppressor gene. AH109 yeast were transformed with the cloned plasmids and grown on selective media as shown in Fig.1 A. Yeast transformed with either AP2α or AP2γ cloned as a fusion with the Gal4 DNA binding domain and co-transformed with a p53/Gal4 activation domain fusion construct (AD/p53) were able to grow on quadruple drop out media. Similarly, yeast were able to grow on selected media when co-transformed with plasmids in which p53 was expressed as a fusion with the Gal4 DNA binding domain (DNA-BD/p53), and AP2γ was expressed as a fusion with the Gal4 activation domain (AD/AP2γ). The protein-protein interaction between p53 and the AP2 factors was confirmed using GST pull-down (see Fig. 1 B). Both AP2α and AP2γ were cloned as GST fusion proteins and incubated with radiolabeled p53. Beads alone or GST protein were included as negative controls, neither of which demonstrated an interaction with p53. Radiolabeled p53 was shown to specifically interact with both AP2α and AP2γ, thus confirming a direct protein-protein interaction. MCF7 breast carcinoma cells endogenously express both wild-type p53 and AP2 factors. This cell line was used to demonstrate an interaction between p53 and AP2 factors in vivo. As seen in Fig.2 A, AP2α activity was detected by gel-shift assay following immunoprecipitation from MCF7 nuclear extract by AP2α-specific antibody. Similarly, AP2α was detected in MCF7 nuclear extract precipitated using antibodies specific for p53. Immunoprecipitation performed with an irrelevant antibody (anti-HA) failed to immunoprecipitate AP2 activity. The interaction between p53 and the AP2 factors was examined in intact cells using indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 2 B). MCF7 cells examined by immunofluorescence demonstrate co-localization for p53 and AP2α. The specificity of the assay was confirmed using HCT116 p53+/+ colon carcinoma cells (23Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Google Scholar) treated with γ-radiation and infected with an adenoviral vector expressing AP2α (AdAP2α). Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated nuclear co-localization of p53 and AP2α. By contrast, infection with wild-type adenovirus (AdWT) demonstrated staining for p53 only and the HCT116 p53−/− cell line infected with AdAP2α demonstrated staining for AP2α only. Similar results were obtained in COS-1 cells transfected with an expression vector for p53 followed by infection with AdAP2α or AdWT (data not shown). These results confirm the yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down results and indicate that p53 and AP2α interact within the nucleus of intact cells under conditions in which both proteins are endogenously expressed. The functional consequences of the p53-AP2α interaction was investigated by examining the effect of AP2α expression on p53-mediated transactivation. As shown in Fig.3 A, a p53-responsive reporter was assayed in CV-1 cells co-transfected with expression vectors for p53 and AP2α. As expected, increasing the amount of p53 expression vector transfected resulted in a reproducible increase in expression from the reporter. Notably, co-expression of AP2α augmented p53-mediated transactivation from the reporter. Transfection of AP2α alone had a negligible affect on luciferase expression indicating that the effect of AP2α was dependent upon p53. Similar results were obtained in COS-1 cells (data not shown). Further confirmation of the dependence on p53 was obtained by using a His-175 mutant of p53, which lacks DNA binding (25Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Google Scholar). The His-175 p53 mutant failed to induce expression from the reporter and co-transfection of AP2α had no effect on luciferase expression. These results indicate that AP2α is able to augment p53-mediated transactivation in a transient assay. Further evidence for AP2α augmentation of p53 transcriptional activation was sought by examining expression of the cyclin kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1, which is regulated by p53-mediated transactivation (28el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Google Scholar, 29Macleod K.F. Sherry N. Hannon G. Beach D. Tokino T. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 935-944Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to examine the interaction between p53 and AP2α on the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells that have an intact p53 gene (p53+/+) or have the p53 alleles disrupted (p53−/−) (23Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Google Scholar). ChIP was performed by immunoprecipitating with anti-AP2α antibody and assaying for the region of the p21 promoter at −2250 targeted by p53. This p53 binding site is far removed from the AP2 sites mapped from −95 to −103 (18Zeng Y.X. Somasundaram K. el-Deiry W.S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 78-82Google Scholar). After cross-linking, anti-AP2α specifically precipitated the region of the p21 promoter targeted by p53 only in the p53+/+ cells (see Fig. 3 B). This result indicates that AP2α interacts with this region of the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter through an association with p53. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that AP2α would augment expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 in the presence of p53. As seen in Fig. 4, AP2α expression had no significant effect on p21 expression in HCT116 p53−/− cells. In HCT116 p53+/+ cells, radiation increased the relative level of p21 mRNA from 4.00 ± 0.13 to 5.95 ± 0.36 (p< 0.01)(Fig. 4 B). In the presence of AP2α, the effect of radiation on the relative levels of p21 was augmented from 3.27 ± 0.66 to 9.07 ± 1.19 (p = 0.01). As seen in Fig.4 C, AP2α expression failed to have a statistically significant effect on induction of p21 mRNA in the absence of p53. By contrast, in the presence of p53, AP2α augmented the induction of p21 expression with radiation from 1.49 ± 0.11 to 2.84 ± 0.21 (p < 0.005). These data are consistent with the luciferase reporter and ChIP results and demonstrate that AP2α is able to augment p53-mediated transactivation of the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter. The G1-S arrest that occurs after radiation is caused, at least in part, by p53-mediated transactivation of p21WAF1/CIP1 (30Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Google Scholar, 31Brugarolas J. Chandrasekaran C. Gordon J.I. Beach D. Jacks T. Hannon G.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 552-557Google Scholar, 32Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190Google Scholar). In addition, both p53 and p21 have been shown to be essential for maintaining the G2 arrest after radiation (23Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Google Scholar). In order to demonstrate the physiologic relevance of increased p21 expression induced by AP2α, we compared cell cycle regulation in HCT116 p53+/+ and p53−/− cells following radiation either with or without AP2α expression. These results are shown in Fig. 5. In HCT116 p53−/− cells, AP2α expression had no significant effect on cell cycle in cells unirradiated or irradiated with 6 Gy γ-radiation. In HCT116 p53+/+ cells in the absence of radiation, AP2α expression had no appreciable effect on G1 and had a slight effect on G2. However, AP2α expression in γ-radiated cells induced a striking alteration in cell cycle with a statistically significant increase in the percent of cells in G1 and G2-M. The increase of the percentage of cells in G1 and G2-M represents an arrest of cells at these two cell cycle checkpoints. This physiologic response is consistent with the effect of APα on expression of the endogenous p21 gene in HCT116 p53+/+ cells. AP2α expression in γ-radiated HCT116 p53+/+ cells also induced a reduction in the percentage of apoptotic cells, and this effect was also dependent upon the presence of p53. The induction of p21 expression with associated changes in cell cycle is compelling evidence that the tumor suppressor activity of AP2α is mediated through an augmentation of p53 activity. Mutations of the p53 gene are the most common alterations found in cancer with 40–45% of all tumor types harboring p53 mutations (33Soussi T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 910 (discussion 137–129): 121-137Google Scholar). The function of p53 as a tumor suppressor gene is directly related to its activity as a sequence-specific transcription factor (34Pietenpol J.A. Tokino T. Thiagalingam S. el-Deiry W.S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1998-2002Google Scholar, 35Chao C. Saito S. Kang J. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4967-4975Google Scholar). Mutations of p53 that are commonly found in cancers have diminished or absent sequence-specific transcriptional activity (36Flaman J.M. Frebourg T. Moreau V. Charbonnier F. Martin C. Chappuis P. Sappino A.P. Limacher I.M. Bron L. Benhattar J. Tada M. VanMeir E.G. Estreicher A. Iggo R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3963-3967Google Scholar), and these mutant p53 proteins lack the ability to induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. A number of genes have been identified as targets of p53 transactivation including p21WAF1/CIP1 (28el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Google Scholar),MDM2 (37Barak Y. Juven T. Haffner R. Oren M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 461-468Google Scholar), GADD45 (38Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. el-Deiry W.S.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4816-4822Google Scholar),and caveolin (40Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Rago C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14517-14522Google Scholar). The expression of p53 target genes has been shown to be cell type-specific. The p21WAF1/CIP1 gene is transactivated by p53 in most cell types (40Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Rago C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14517-14522Google Scholar) and has been shown to be critical for G1 and G2 cell cycle arrest following radiation (30Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Google Scholar, 31Brugarolas J. Chandrasekaran C. Gordon J.I. Beach D. Jacks T. Hannon G.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 552-557Google Scholar, 32Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190Google Scholar). We have demonstrated a direct protein-protein interaction between p53 and AP2α, which results in an augmentation of p53-mediated transcriptional activation. An earlier study reported that expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 was induced by AP2α and suggested that AP2α directly targeted the p21 promoter (18Zeng Y.X. Somasundaram K. el-Deiry W.S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 78-82Google Scholar). Our findings extend this observation and demonstrate that the mechanism of p21 transactivation by AP2α is dependent upon wild-type p53. Our results with ChIP analysis provide additional mechanistic evidence that p53 targets AP2α to the p53 binding sites in the p21 promoter. Clinical studies have demonstrated an association between AP2α and p21 expression in colon carcinoma (21Ropponen K.M. Kellokoski J.K. Lipponen P.K. Pietilainen T. Eskelinen M.J. Alhava E.M. Kosma V.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 133-140Google Scholar), breast cancer (15Gee J.M. Robertson J.F. Ellis I.O. Nicholson R.I. Hurst H.C. J. Pathol. 1999; 189: 514-520Google Scholar), and stage I cutaneous malignant melanoma (17Karjalainen J.M. Kellokoski J.K. Eskelinen M.J. Alhava E.M. Kosma V.M. J. Clin. Oncol. 1998; 16: 3584-3591Google Scholar). Interestingly, the association between AP2α and p21 expression is lost in late phases of melanoma progression (41Baldi A. Santini D. Battista T. Dragonetti E. Ferranti G. Petitti T. Groeger A.M. Angelini A. Rossiello R. Baldi F. Natali P.G. Paggi M.G. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 83: 364-372Google Scholar) and ∼10% of early stage melanomas will express AP2α but fail to express p21 (17Karjalainen J.M. Kellokoski J.K. Eskelinen M.J. Alhava E.M. Kosma V.M. J. Clin. Oncol. 1998; 16: 3584-3591Google Scholar). Since our model predicts that the association between p21 and AP2α expression is dependent upon p53, the lack of correlation between p21 and AP2α in some tumors suggests the presence of certain p53 mutations that lose the ability to interact with AP2α. Our results provide a model that may explain associations in the patterns of gene expression in breast cancer. Approximately 20% of breast cancers demonstrate intense staining for p53 by immunohistochemistry, which indicates the presence of a missense mutation that stabilizes the p53 protein. Numerous studies of breast cancers have reported an association between expression of p53 by immunohistochemistry (hence, stabilizing p53 mutations) and a lack of expression of estrogen receptor-α (ERα) and overexpression of c-ErbB2 (42Cattoretti G.

Studies of the expression of AP2 factors in primary breast cancers have supported the conclusions from promoter analysis. Patterns of expression in breast tumors have demonstrated a statistically significant association between AP2α expression and ERα expression (55Turner B.C. Zhang J. Gumbs A.A. Maher M.G. Kaplan L. Carter D. Glazer P.M. Hurst H.C. Haffty B.G. Williams T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5466-5472Google Scholar), and within ERα-positive tumors, there was a positive correlation between the level of AP2α and the expression of ERα (15Gee J.M. Robertson J.F. Ellis I.O. Nicholson R.I. Hurst H.C. J. Pathol. 1999; 189: 514-520Google Scholar). There was also an inverse correlation between AP2α expression and expression of ErbB2 (15Gee J.M. Robertson J.F. Ellis I.O. Nicholson R.I. Hurst H.C. J. Pathol. 1999; 189: 514-520Google Scholar), supporting the promoter studies that suggested that AP2α may inhibit ErbB2 gene expression. The interaction between AP2α and p53 could provide a mechanism to explain why breast cancers with nuclear accumulation of p53 are ERα-negative and ErbB2-positive. For example, it is plausible that the accumulation of mutated p53 protein results in the formation of p53-AP2α complexes that are transcriptionally inactive. Such a situation could account for the simultaneous loss of ERα and overexpression of ErbB2. Similarly, the interaction between p53 and AP2α may account for patterns of gene expression in colon cancer. Approximately 50–60% of colon tumors harbor p53 mutations as evidenced by intense staining for p53 by immunohistochemistry and within this group of tumors, ∼20% will have intense p21 expression (21Ropponen K.M. Kellokoski J.K. Lipponen P.K. Pietilainen T. Eskelinen M.J. Alhava E.M. Kosma V.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 133-140Google Scholar). This situation has been explained by a presumed “p53-independent” mechanism of p21 activation. However, our data suggest the possibility that some mutations of p53 may be complemented through an interaction with AP2α. Therefore, our model predicts that colon cancers with mutated p53 and intense p21 expression have p53 proteins that can be transcriptionally activated through an association with AP2α. AP2α has been shown to function as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer, colon cancer, and malignant melanoma. We conclude that the mechanism of tumor suppressor activity of AP2α is mediated, at least in part, through an augmentation of p53 transcriptional activation.

Science. 1990; 248: 76-79Google Scholar) have been shown to target p53 and the interaction between p53 and these viral oncogenes is required for transformation. Our results now demonstrate that a cellular tumor suppressor gene similarly targets p53. There are likely to be a limited number of pathways through which a tumor suppressor acts to alter cell growth. Our model of the mechanism of AP2α tumor suppressor activity lends additional support for a central role for a p53-mediated checkpoint and demonstrates that other tumor suppressor genes can regulate cell growth by modulating p53 activity.

https://openalex.org/W1984377333,"Menin, a nuclear protein encoded by the tumor suppressor gene MEN1, interacts with the AP-1 transcription factor JunD and inhibits its transcriptional activity. In addition, overexpression of Menin counteracts Ras-induced tumorigenesis. We show that Menin inhibits ERK-dependent phosphorylation and activation of both JunD and the Ets-domain transcription factor Elk-1. We also show that Menin represses the inducible activity of the c-fos promoter. Furthermore, Menin expression inhibits Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated phosphorylation of both JunD and c-Jun. Kinase assays show that Menin overexpression does not interfere with activation of either ERK2 or JNK1, suggesting that Menin acts at a level downstream of MAPK activation. An N-terminal deletion mutant of Menin that cannot inhibit JunD phosphorylation by JNK, can still repress JunD phosphorylation by ERK2, suggesting that Menin interferes with ERK and JNK pathways through two distinct inhibitory mechanisms. Taken together, our data suggest that Menin uncouples ERK and JNK activation from phosphorylation of their nuclear targets Elk-1, JunD and c-Jun, hence inhibiting accumulation of active Fos/Jun heterodimers. This study provides new molecular insights into the tumor suppressor function of Menin and suggests a mechanism by which Menin may interfere with Ras-dependent cell transformation and oncogenesis."

(2001)J. Biol. Chem. 276, 17367–17372). In this study, we characterized the function of another isoform of CHP (designated CHP2) that has a 61% amino acid identity with CHP1. CHP2, like CHP1, conferred the ability to NHEs 1–3 to express a high exchange activity by binding to the juxtamembrane region of the cytoplasmic domain of the exchanger, but it interacts more strongly (∼5-fold) with NHE1 than does CHP1. Although CHP1 is expressed ubiquitously at relatively high levels, CHP2 expression was extremely low in most human tissues but was higher in tumor cells. We produced stable cell clones overexpressing either CHP1 or CHP2 in which one of them is predominantly bound to NHE1. Serum (10%) induced a significant cytoplasmic alkalinization (0.1–0.2 pH unit) in cells co-expressing CHP1 and NHE1 but not in cells co-expressing CHP2 and NHE1. In the latter, pHi was high (7.4–7.5) even in the absence of serum, suggesting that NHE1 was already activated. Surprisingly, most (>80%) of CHP2/NHE1 cells unlike CHP1/NHE1 cells were viable even after long serum starvation (>7 days). Thus, the expression of CHP2 appears to protect cells from serum deprivation-induced death by increasing pHi. These properties of CHP2/NHE1 cells are similar to those of malignantly transformed cells. We propose that serum-independent activation of NHE1 by bound CHP2 is one of the key mechanisms for the maintenance of high pHi and the resistance to serum deprivation-induced cell death in malignantly transformed cells.

However, molecular mechanisms underlying these phenotypic alterations remain poorly understood.Recently, we have provided evidence that calcineurin B homologous protein (CHP1) serves as an essential cofactor, which is required for at least three NHE isoforms, NHEs 1–3, to express high physiological levels of exchange activity because CHP1 deprivation results in dramatic reductions (>90%) of activity (6Pang T., Su, X. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17367-17372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how CHP1 is involved in the regulation of NHEs in response to the extracellular stimuli. There is another human CHP isoform (CHP2) that was identified in human cancer patient (NCBI nucleotide accession number NM_022097 with designation of hepatocellular carcinoma antigen gene 520). CHP2 protein shares high homology with CHP1 (61% amino acid identity). This prompted us to study functional differences between the two CHP isoforms, because such investigation would provide an important clue as to the role of CHP in the NHE1 regulation.In this study, we found that cells co-expressing NHE1 and CHP2 but not cells co-expressing NHE1 and CHP1 maintain high pHi through the activation of NHE1 even in the absence of serum. In addition, such cells remain viable even after serum starvation over 1 week. We conclude that the interaction of NHE1 with CHP2 but not with CHP1 leads to serum-independent permanent activation of NHE1, which is a well documented property found in malignantly transformed cells.RESULTSHuman CHP2 protein has a primary sequence highly homologous to those of human CHP1 (NCBI protein accession number Q99653, 61% identity), mouse CHP1 (NCBI protein accession number Q62877, 60% identity), and mouse CHP2 (NCBI protein accession number Q9D869, 80% identity) (Fig. 1 A). Similar to CHP1, CHP2 contains an N-terminal myristoylation site (Gly-2) as well as four EF-hand Ca2+ binding motifs of which two ancestral sites may not bind Ca2+ because of the substitution of critical acidic residues (Fig. 1 A). We compared the expressions of CHP1 and CHP2 by RT-PCR using a cDNA panel from normal human tissues, i.e. brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, placenta, and skeletal muscle (human MTCTM panel I). PCR bands for CHP1 were detected in all of the human tissues tested (Fig. 1 B). However, PCR bands for CHP2 were not detected in these tissues even after 35 cycles of PCR amplification (Fig. 1 B). Consistent with these observations, we failed to detect CHP2 message in normal human tissues including brain, heart, skeletal muscle, colon, thymus, spleen, kidney, liver, small intestine, placenta, lung, and peripheral blood leukocyte by Northern blot analysis in which commercially available poly(A+) RNA Northern blot (human 12-line MTNTMblot, Clontech) were hybridized with the32P-labeled full-length CHP2 probe under high stringency conditions (data not shown). In contrast to normal tissues, on the other hand, RT-PCR readily detected CHP2 as well as CHP1 in several malignantly transformed cells (Fig. 1 C). The CHP2 expression in some cancer cells was also confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1 D). Taken together, these data suggest that CHP2 is expressed in malignantly transformed cells although rarely expressed in normal tissues or cells.We previously showed that CHP1 binds to specific juxtamembrane regions (amino acids 510–530 in case of NHE1) of the cytoplasmic domains of NHEs 1–4 (6Pang T., Su, X. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17367-17372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). CHP1 is also likely to bind to a corresponding region in NHE5 because of the high sequence homology of the relevant regions. We examined whether CHP2 binds to these CHP1-binding regions in NHEs 1–3 by observing subcellular localization of GFP-tagged CHP. In the exchanger-deficient PS120 cells, GFP-tagged CHP2 was uniformly distributed in the cytosol (data not shown). In contrast, in cells expressing NHE 1, 2, or 3, a part of CHP2-GFP was localized in the plasma membrane (Fig. 2). However, plasma membrane localization of CHP2-GFP was not detected in cells expressing mutant exchangers NHE1–4R, NHE2–3R, or NHE3–4R, which do not bind CHP1 (Fig. 2) (6Pang T., Su, X. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17367-17372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), indicating that CHP2 also binds to CHP1-binding regions in NHEs 1–3.Interaction of CHP2 with NHE1 was also confirmed by pull-down assay using a MBP fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic domain (aa503–815) of NHE1 (Fig.3 A). As a negative control, we showed that CHP2 does not bind to a MBP fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic domain (aa500–669) of NHE6 (Fig. 3 B). These data suggest that CHP2 directly interacts with the juxtamembrane CHP1-binding site in the plasma membrane-type exchangers. To examine the relative binding efficiency of CHP1 versus CHP2, we carried out pull-down assay using MBP-NHE1 fusion proteins in the presence of a constant amount of CHP2 and different amounts of CHP1. As shown in Fig. 3 C, lower panel, the amount of CHP2 protein recovered by pull down decreased with increasing amounts of CHP1 by competitive interaction for the common binding site in NHE1. When 250 μg of CHP1 and 50 μg of CHP2 were present, almost equal amounts of CHP1 and 2 were recovered (Fig. 3 C), suggesting that CHP2 binds to NHE1 more strongly (∼5-fold) than does CHP1.Figure 3Pull-down assay for CHP-NHE interaction. A and B, 150 μg of CHP2-His protein was mixed with 30 μl of amylose resin pretreated with 200 μg of MBP-NHE1 or MBP-NHE6 fusion protein, respectively, and incubated for 60 min. After resins were washed, proteins were eluted with 50 mmmaltose, electrophoresed, and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. C, 50 μg of CHP2-His protein and different amounts of CHP1-His protein were mixed with 30 μl of amylose resin pretreated with 100 μg of MBP-NHE1 fusion protein, incubated for 60 min, eluted, and analyzed by electrophoresis (bottom panel). Protein inputs were also shown for reference (upper and middle panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We used the oocyte expression system to examine the role of CHP2 in the exchange activity. As shown in Fig. 4, the injection of cRNA for NHE1 or NHE3 significantly enhanced exchange activity in oocytes. Co-injection of cRNA for CHP1 or CHP2 together with cRNA for NHE1 or NHE3 further enhanced the exchange activity. The data suggest that CHP1 and CHP2 have the ability to increase exchange activities of NHE1 and NHE3 to a similar extent.Figure 4Oocyte experiment.

Immunoblot analysis revealed that PS120 cells express a relatively high level of endogenous CHP1 and a very low level of endogenous CHP2 as compared with the respective proteins overexpressed in the same cells (Fig.5). Anti-CHP1 immunoprecipitated NHE1 protein from cells co-expressing CHP1/NHE1 but not from cells co-expressing CHP2/NHE1, whereas anti-CHP2 immunoprecipitated NHE1 protein from cells co-expressing CHP2/NHE1 but not from cells co-expressing CHP1/NHE1 (Fig. 5). These antibodies immunoprecipitated much lower levels of NHE1 protein from NHE1 transfectants not expressing exogenous CHP1 or CHP2 (Fig. 5), consistent with the above finding that PS120 cells express endogenous CHP1 and CHP2. The NHE1 protein was not detected in the immunoprecipitated material obtained with anti-CHP2 from cells not expressing NHE1 (Fig. 5, n.t.or CHP2) or cells expressing a CHP-binding-defective NHE1 (Fig. 5, 4Q). These data suggest that exogenous CHP1 or CHP2 replaces endogenous CHP bound to NHE1 protein.Figure 5Co-immunoprecipitation analysis of CHP/NHE1 interaction. CHPs and NHE1 variants expressed stably in PS120 cells are shown above the panels, whereas antibodies used are shown on the left side of each panel. In 4Q, four hydrophobic residues, Phe526, Leu527, Leu530, and Leu531 of NHE1, were replaced by four glutamine residues. In the experiments for the top four panels, 20-μg proteins from total cell homogenate were analyzed by immunoblotting (IB). In the experiments for thelast three panels, cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with indicated antibodies and then analyzed by immunoblotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” n.t., non-transfected cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We examined the effect of 24-h serum depletion on exchange activity in cells co-expressing CHP1/NHE1 or CHP2/NHE1 measured at different pHi values. Both groups of cells exhibited high22Na+ uptake activity (50–60 nmol/mg/min) at low pHi (5.6), independent of serum depletion (Fig.6 A). In CHP1/NHE1 cells, exchange activity at a neutral pHi (6.8–7.2) was significantly lower with serum depletion than without serum depletion (Fig. 6,B–D). In sharp contrast, prior treatment with or without serum did not affect exchange activity significantly in CHP2/NHE1 cells at all pHi values tested (Fig. 6, B–D). Consistent with 22Na+ uptake, the resting pHi in CHP2/NHE1 cells was significantly elevated (7.4–7.5) in the absence (Fig. 7 A) or presence (Fig.7 B) of bicarbonate regardless of prior treatment with or without serum, whereas pHi was significantly lower in CHP1/NHE1 cells subjected to serum deprivation. Thus, NHE1 was constitutively activated in cells expressing CHP2/NHE1. Of note, long serum depletion significantly reduces pHi in CHP2 transfectants not expressing NHE1 (Fig. 7) or in cells co-expressing the CHP-binding-defective NHE1 mutant 4Q and CHP2 (data not shown). Such an effect was also observed in non-transfected PS120 cells (data not shown), suggesting that relatively long serum depletion may affect other pHi-regulating systems.Figure 6The effect of serum depletion on22Na+ uptake activity. PS120 cells stably co-expressing CHP1/NHE1 or CHP2/NHE1 grown in 24-wells were serum-depleted for 24 h. The pHi values of serum-supplemented (open bars) or serum-depleted cells (closed bars) were clamped at 5.6, 6.8, 7.0, or 7.2 by incubating cells in the solutions containing nigericin and the appropriate concentrations of KCl, and then EIPA-sensitive22Na+ uptake was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are means ± S.D.

The resting pHi of PS120 cells expressing CHP2, CHP1/NHE1, or CHP2/NHE1, which were maintained for 24 h in the presence (open bars) or absence (closed bars) of serum, was measured in the absence (A) or presence (B) of 25 mm NaHCO3 by monitoring BCECF fluorescence as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are means ± S.D. (n = 9).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We next examined the acute effect of serum addition on pHi of cells that had been maintained for 24 h under serum depletion. Serum induced a relatively large cytoplasmic alkalinization in CHP1/NHE1 cells as measured by BCECF fluorescence (Fig.8 A) or 14C-benzoic acid equilibration method (Fig. 8 B). Cytoplasmic alkalinization occurred similarly in NHE1 cells or in CHP1/NHE1 cells (Fig. 8 B). In contrast, serum addition caused a minimum alkalinization in CHP2/NHE1 cells. Alkalinization was not observed in CHP2 transfectants not expressing NHE1 or in CHP2 transfectants expressing 4Q (Fig. 8, A and B). These results confirmed that NHE1 was already activated in CHP2/NHE1 transfectants maintained in the absence of serum.Intracellular pH has been reported to influence both cell growth (4Grinstein S.

Indeed, cell number increased efficiently in the presence of serum upon expression of NHE1 regardless of the type of CHP isoform co-expressed, whereas cells expressing 4Q grew relatively slowly (Fig.9 A). Despite this apparently similar role of CHP1 and CHP2 in cell growth, the ability to maintain cell viability under serum starvation was dramatically different between cells expressing NHE1/CHP1 and NHE1/CHP2 (Fig. 9 B). We evaluated cell viability by counting the number of cells remained attached to dishes during serum starvation. These cells excluded trypan blue and were able to restart growth upon re-addition of serum. Cells expressing CHP2/NHE1 were significantly more resistant to serum starvation ( t12 = ∼14 days) than cells expressing CHP1/NHE1 ( t12 = ∼4 days). Surprisingly, 60% of cells expressing CHP2/NHE1 were still viable 10 days after serum starvation when all CHP1/NHE1 cells lost viability (Fig.9 B). The high viability of CHP2/NHE1 cells required enhanced NHE1 activity but not the expression of CHP2 itself, because both CHP2 or CHP2/4Q cells were very sensitive to serum starvation (t t12 = ∼2 days) (Fig. 9 B) and because EIPA markedly accelerated the loss of viability in CHP2/NHE1 cells (Fig. 9 C). These data suggest that the high viability of CHP2/NHE1 cells may be the result of high pHi caused by high Na+/H+ activity achieved in these serum-starved cells.Figure 9Effect of expression of CHP1 or CHP2 on cell growth and cell viability under serum starvation.

We counted the number of cells that remained attached in four 5 × 5-mm square areas/each dish. We counted the cell numbers in the same areas throughout experiments and plotted them in the figure. Three dishes were used for respective transfectants. Data are means ± S.D. (n = 12).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this study, we characterized the function of CHP2 that shares a high sequence homology with CHP1. We previously reported that CHP1 serves as an essential cofactor, supporting the physiological activity of plasma membrane-type Na+/H+ exchangers (6Pang T., Su, X. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17367-17372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). CHP2 exerts similar effects. (i) GFP-tagged CHP2 co-localized with NHEs 1–3 but not with CHP1-binding-defective mutants NHE1–4R, NHE2–3R, or NHE3–4R in the plasma membrane. (ii) Recombinant CHP2 was bound to a MBP fusion protein containing the NHE1 cytoplasmic domain but not the fusion protein containing NHE6 cytoplasmic domain. (iii) CHP2 enhanced exchange activities of NHE1 and NHE3 when co-expressed with them in oocytes. (iv) The V max of CHP2/NHE1 was comparable with that of CHP1/NHE1, whereas CHP2/4Q cells exhibited a very low exchange activity (<10%) compared with CHP2/NHE1.Intriguingly, CHP1/NHE1 and CHP2/NHE1 cells responded differently to serum depletion, although they exhibited a similar high exchange activity when maintained in serum. In the absence of serum, CHP2/NHE1 exhibited a higher steady-state pHi and higher exchange activity in the neutral pHi range as compared with CHP1/NHE1. Thus, NHE1 becomes activated with bound CHP2 independent of serum. We observed that steady-state levels of pHi in CHP1/NHE1 and CHP2/NHE1 cells maintained for 24 h in serum-supplemented or serum-depleted medium were not affected by the presence or absence of bicarbonate. In contrast, the presence of bicarbonate influenced the response of CHP1/NHE1 cells to a short incubation (10–20 min) with serum. The pHi of CHP1/NHE1 was elevated in response to acute exposure to serum in the absence of bicarbonate (Fig. 8), but this did not happen in the presence of bicarbonate (data not shown). Such an inhibitory effect of bicarbonate on pHi may be because of activation of the anion exchanger. At present, however, it is not clear why bicarbonate did not exhibit an inhibitory influence on pHiin CHP1/NHE1 and CHP2/NHE1 cells chronically exposed to serum (Fig.7).We found that CHP2/NHE1 cells are highly viable even under a long term serum starvation. Ubiquitous CHP1 was previously suggested to be involved in various cell functions, such as inhibition of calcineurin activity (37Lin X. Sikkink R.A. Rusnak F. Barber D.L. J. Biol.

Translocase is a membrane-bound enzyme complex that mediates the translocation across and integration of proteins into the cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli (for a review see Ref. 1Manting E.H. Driessen A.J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 226-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Secretory proteins are synthesized in the cytosol as precursors with an amino-terminal signal sequence targeted to the membrane and subsequently transported across the membrane in an ATP-dependent manner via a proteinaceous channel formed by a heterotrimeric membrane protein complex composed of SecY, SecE, and SecG (2Brundage L.

Translocation is a stepwise process that involves cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis by SecA and concomitant steps of precursor protein SecA association and dissociation. The precursor protein is threaded across the membrane in steps of ∼2.5 kDa (7Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.U. Wickner W.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). During the last decade, the biochemical mechanism of protein translocation has been studied in great detail. This advance has been possible attributed to the availability of a robust in vitrotranslocation assay. This assay is based on a method in which radioactively labeled precursor proteins are added to inner membrane vesicles (IMVs) in the presence of soluble components (SecA, SecB, and so on) and a suitable energy source (ATP). Precursor proteins are subsequently translocated into the lumen of the IMVs whereupon the membranes are treated with externally added proteinase to digest all nontranslocated substrate, whereas the translocated protein is inaccessible. The remaining protein is finally analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Normally, the substrate proteins are synthesized in a (coupled) transcription/translation system resulting in radiochemical amounts of protein. Alternatively, the precursor protein can be isolated from an overproducing strain, purified, and radiolabeled by means of iodination. Although the method is reliable, it is time-consuming, discontinuous, and produces radioactive waste. Because of the use of radiochemical amounts of precursor protein, the exact substrate concentration is often not known; therefore, reactions are frequently performed under non-saturating conditions. Especially for quantitative biochemical and kinetic studies, it is important to obtain exact estimates of initial rates. In the current era of proteomic studies, there is also an increasing demand for simple and rapid assays that can be automated. Such systems are in particular useful for high throughput drug-screening programs. To overcome the problems associated with the classical protease accessibility assay, we set out to develop a real-time fluorescent protein translocation assay. Here, we show that fluorescently labeled precursor proteins are translocated into IMVs via an authentic mechanism as validated by a fluorescent variant of the classical translocation assay. Translocation of these fluorescent precursor proteins could be directly monitored by means of fluorescence quenching. This allowed a precise determination of the turnover rate and other kinetic parameters of protein translocation. IMVs with overexpressed or wild-type levels of SecYEG were derived from E. coli strains KM9 or SF100 transformed with pET610 (10Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K.

SecYEG was reconstituted into liposomes of E. coli phospholipids (Avanti polar lipids, Alabaster, AL) by detergent dilution (3Manting E.H. van der Does C. Remigy H. Engel A. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Maleimide derivatives of fluorescein, Texas Red, Oregon Green, and Alexa Fluor 633 were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). A plasmid encoding proOmpA (C302S,proOmpA-Cys-290) (pET502) was constructed from pET147 (8van der Wolk J.P. de Wit J.G. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7297-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) by site-directed mutagenesis. Cysteine-less proOmpA-(C290S,C302S) (pET2345) was constructed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and used to introduce single cysteines at positions +4 and +33 of the mature OmpA, yielding pET2346 (D4C,proOmpA-Cys-4) and pET2348 (N33C,proOmpA-Cys-33). pET502 was used as template to construct the double cysteine mutant proOmpA (C302S,D291C,proOmpA-Cys-290,Cys-291) (pET2349). ProOmpA was purified as described previously (13Crooke E. Brundage L. Rice M. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1831-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Prior to labeling, the proOmpA (3.5 mg/ml in 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) was reduced with 1 mm tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and incubated with 2 mm fluorescent maleimide at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 10 mm dithiothreitol, and the unreacted label was removed by gel filtration on a P6 spin column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The protein was collected by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and resuspended in 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. The labeling efficiency was determined spectroscopically. With Texas Red, double labeling of proOmpA (C302S,D291C) could be validated by a slower migration on SDS-PAGE of the double-labeled protein relative to the unlabeled or single labeled protein. Translocation of fluorescently labeled proOmpA into SecYEG proteoliposomes or inner membrane vesicles was assayed by the accessibility to added proteinase K (14Cunningham K. Lill R. Crooke E. Rice M. Moore K. Wickner W. Oliver D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Reactions (final volume 50 μl) were performed in translocation buffer (50 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmMg(OAc)2 with 10 mm phosphocreatine, 50 μg/ml creatine kinase, 20 μg/ml SecA, 32 μg/ml SecB, 5 μg/ml proOmpA) started by the addition of 2 mm ATP, incubated for various time intervals at 37 °C, and stopped by chilling on ice. Translocation reactions were analyzed by proteinase K treatment (8van der Wolk J.P. de Wit J.G. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7297-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and SDS-PAGE and directly visualized in gelwith a Roche Lumi-Imager F1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Exposure was for 500 ms up to 1 s. For the imaging of fluorescein and Oregon Green, Texas Red, and Alexa Fluor 633, high pass filters were used with a cutoff at 520, 600, and 645 nm, respectively. Translocation of OG-labeled proOmpA was assayed directly using an Aminco Bowman Series 2 spectrometer (SLM Instruments). Excitation and emission were set to 491 and 515 nm, respectively, with slit-widths of 4 nm. Translocation reaction mixtures in a thermostated microcuvette with a volume of 150 μl were preincubated for 3 min at 37 °C and started by the addition of 2 mm ATP. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The SecA ATPase activity was assayed as described previously (14Cunningham K. Lill R. Crooke E. Rice M. Moore K. Wickner W. Oliver D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Western blots were developed with a monoclonal antibody against proOmpA (3Manting E.H. van der Does C. Remigy H. Engel A. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Scatchard analysis of the binding of SecA to IMVs was done essentially as described previously (5Hartl F.U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The size of various fluorescent dyes was estimated after modeling of the chemicals using the HyperChem package (Hypercube Inc., Gainesville, FL) on a Silicon Graphics workstation. Wild-type proOmpA contains two cysteine residues at positions 290 and 302. To obtain a uniform fluorescently labeled proOmpA protein, a single cysteine mutant of proOmpA was created by replacing the cysteine at position 302 by a serine (proOmpA-Cys-290). In addition, cysteine at position 290 was replaced by a serine to obtain a cysteine-less proOmpA that was used to control the degree of nonspecific labeling. Under reducing conditions, Cys-less proOmpA and proOmpA-Cys-290 were translocated with an efficiency equal to wild-type proOmpA as assayed by immunoblotting (data not shown). With both mutant proOmpA proteins, the proOmpA-stimulated SecA translocation ATPase activity was indistinguishable from the wild type (data not shown). Subsequently, the cysteine mutants were labeled with a maleimide derivative of the fluorescent probe OG. Spectroscopic analysis showed that proOmpA-Cys-290 could be labeled with an efficiency of ∼70% under conditions that there was only minor labeling of Cys-less proOmpA (Fig. 1 A). This residual background level is probably because of the presence of some endogenous proOmpA that co-purifies with the overproduced Cys-less mutant. OG-labeled proOmpA-Cys-290 was used next in a translocation reaction with proteoliposomes containing purified SecYEG. Translocation was assayed by means of the protease protection assay, and protease-protected fragments were visualized by direct fluorescent imaging of the SDS-PAGE gel. The presence of protease-protected full-length fluorescent proOmpA was dependent on SecA, ATP (Fig.1 B), and the SecYEG complex (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with IMVs bearing wild-type or overexpression levels of SecYEG (Fig. 1 B). In IMVs, a major fraction of the fluorescent proOmpA was processed by leader peptidase, yielding fluorescent mature OmpA (Fig. 1 B). Taken together, these data demonstrate that OG-labeled proOmpA is translocated in an authentic Sec-dependent manner. The size of OG (∼10–13 Å) could possibly influence the kinetics of translocation. Therefore, the translocation kinetics of the fluorescent proOmpA was compared with the unlabeled proOmpA-Cys-290 by Western blotting. Both proteins were translocated into SecA-SecYEG proteoliposomes with similar kinetics (Fig. 1 C), demonstrating that Oregon Green labeling does not significantly interfere with the translocation reaction. To further examine possible size restrictions by the translocation pore, proOmpA-Cys-290 was labeled with fluorescent dyes of different sizes and translocation was assayed in time. Of the maleimide probes used (fluorescein, eosin, Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 633, and Texas Red), Texas Red maleimide was the largest fluorescent molecule with a size of ∼13–16 Å. However, Texas Red did not interfere with the kinetics of proOmpA translocation into SecYEG-proteoliposomes (data not shown) or SecYEG IMVs (Fig. 1 D). Even double labeling of proOmpA with Texas Red on two consecutive cysteines (proOmpA-Cys-290,Cys-291) did not impair translocation (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the translocation pore is sufficiently wide or flexible to allow the translocation of proOmpA labeled with bulky fluorescent probes measuring up to at least 16 Å. The fluorescent probe OG was attached to other unique cysteine positions in proOmpA to determine whether there are positional restrictions. For this purpose, a unique cysteine was introduced at the +4 position from the signal sequence cleavage site (proOmpA-Cys-4) and at position +33 (proOmpA-Cys-33). These positions were chosen to map in loop regions of the OmpA structure to minimize any interference of the labeling in the formation of the β-sheet structure (15Pautsch A. Schulz G.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Both cysteine mutants were efficiently translocated into IMVs (data not shown). However, after labeling with OG (Fig.2 A) or Texas Red, the presence of the fluorophore at position + 4 strongly inhibited proOmpA translocation. On the other hand, OG did not interfere with translocation when the probe was bound to a cysteine at position +33 (Fig. 2 A) or +66 (proOmpA-S66C). 2N. Nouwen, unpublished results. Strikingly, when the translocation of OG-labeled proOmpA-Cys-4 mutant was assayed with IMVs bearing the overexpressed PrlA4 mutant (16Emr S.D. Hanley-Way S. Silhavy T.J. Cell. 1981; 23: 79-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), translocation was restored (Fig. 2). This demonstrates that PrlA4 not only suppresses secretion defects caused by a defective or missing signal sequence but that it also restores the translocation of defective precursor proteins with aberrant structural elements that are not part of the signal sequence. To study the kinetics of protein translocation, a real-time spectroscopic assay was developed. Initially, the translocation of OG-labeled proOmpA-Cys-290 into IMVs containing overexpressed SecYEG was assayed in the presence of a membrane-impermeable quencher. For this purpose,p-xylene-bis-pyridinium bromide and potassium iodine were tested, because these compounds had no effect on the efficiency of protein translocation when used at a concentration of 40 and 60 mm, respectively 3P. Natale, unpublished results. (data not shown). Translocation was initiated by the addition of ATP, and the fluorescence level was monitored in time. It was reasoned that if the fluorescence of OG-labeled proOmpA would be quenched at the outside of the vesicles, translocation of the proOmpA into the vesicles would result in an increase in fluorescence. However, after the initiation of translocation, instead of an increase, a progressive decrease in fluorescence was observed to ∼15% of its initial value after 5 min. Identical results were obtained when fluorescein or Texas Red-labeled proOmpA was used (data not shown). Strikingly, in the absence of added quencher, a similar decrease in fluorescence was observed (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that this phenomenon is caused by an intrinsic quenching process. This could either be self-quenching, resulting from the accumulation of precursor protein in the lumen of the IMVs, or be attributed to the presence of an intrinsic quencher that is associated with the IMVs. Therefore, further experiments were performed in the absence of added quencher. The decrease in fluorescence was dependent on SecA (data not shown) and hydrolyzable ATP (Fig. 3 C) and was inhibited when a 100-fold excess of unlabeled proOmpA was added as a competitor (Fig. 3 B). In the absence of nucleotide or in the presence of ADP or the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PNP, the fluorescence remained constant (Fig. 3 C). The presence of an ATP-regenerating system, i.e. creatine kinase and creatine phosphate, stimulated protein translocation (Fig. 3, A andC) (17Shiozuka K. Tani K. Mizushima S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18843-18847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of ATP to IMVs not only energizes SecA but also results in the generation of a PMF via the proton-pumping F0F1-ATPase. The transmembrane pH gradient (ΔpH) component of the PMF affects the luminal pH of the IMVs. Because the quantum yield of some fluorophores is pH-dependent, we had to ascertain that the observed quenching is not caused by an acidic pH in the lumen of the IMVs. Therefore, the translocation was assayed in the absence and presence of the ionophore nigericin (1.5 μm) to dissipate the ΔpH. With OG-labeled proOmpA, nigericin had no effect on the fluorescent signal. However, when fluorescein was used, the addition of nigericin resulted in a marked increase in fluorescence (data not shown). Nigericin had no effect on the decrease in fluorescence with fluorescein-labeled proOmpA when SecYEG overexpression IMVs were used derived from an unc− strain NN100 (18Nouwen N. van der Laan M. Driessen A.J.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or when urea-treated IMVs were used that are unable to generate a ΔpH by ATP hydrolysis. Therefore, with fluorescein, quenching is partially caused by a pH-dependent change in fluorescence quantum yield. This implies that the fluorescent proOmpA derivatives are indeed translocated into the lumen of the IMVs. To examine whether the decrease in fluorescence was directly correlated to the amount of translocated proOmpA, samples were drawn from the fluorescence cuvette at different time points and further analyzed in a protease protection assay and in gelfluorescent imaging. The kinetics of the fluorescence decrease was paralleled by an increase in the amount of protease-protected proOmpA (Fig. 3 D) showing that within this range a linear relation exists between the quenching of the fluorescent signal and the amount of translocated proOmpA. Similar results were obtained when instead of IMVs SecYEG proteoliposomes were used (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the fluorescent on-line assay can be used for a direct kinetic analysis. To measure true kinetics of protein translocation, it is important that a saturating concentration of precursor protein is used and that initial rates conditions are assessed. Both requirements can be met by the real-time fluorescent assay; therefore, we set out to determine the turnover number of the translocase in vitro. The number of translocation sites was determined by Scatchard analysis of the binding of SecA to SecYEG IMVs. For further calculations, it was assumed that a single SecA dimer binds to one translocation site (formed by a SecYEG oligomer). For the IMVs bearing overexpressed SecYEG or PrlA4, the number of SecA binding sites was estimated to be ∼80 and 35 pmol/mg IMVs, respectively. The rate of proOmpA translocation was determined over a wide range of proOmpA concentrations (0–0.9 μm) at a fixed IMV concentration and saturating concentrations of the other Sec components (Fig. 4 B). With IMVs bearing the overexpressed SecYEG complex, the turnover appeared ∼4.5 molecules of proOmpA/translocation site/min with an apparentK m for proOmpA of 180 nm. A marked increase in turnover was observed with the PrlA4 mutant yielding a value of 40 molecules of proOmpA/translocation site/min and an apparentK m for proOmpA of 420 nm. Remarkably, with PrlA4 IMVs, also a higher level of fluorescence quenching was obtained as compared with the wild-type SecYEG complex (Fig.4 A). This finding suggests that the PrlA4 mutant is capable of translocating a larger fraction of the added proOmpA possibly including some proOmpA that is translocation-incompetent with the wild-type SecYEG complex. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the PrlA4 mutation enhances the turnover of the functional translocase. Protein translocation is stimulated by the PMF. To study the effect of the PMF on the translocation rate, assays were performed in the absence and presence of the ionophores nigericin and valinomycin (both at 1.5 μm). Under these conditions, a complete loss of the PMF is obtained as confirmed by fluorescent ΔpH measurements using the dye 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (data not shown). Dissipation of the PMF in SecYEG overexpression IMVs resulted in a >3-fold reduction of the turnover rate to 1.2 molecules of proOmpA/translocation site/min with no significant change in apparent K m for proOmpA (Table I). Translocation in the PrlA4 mutant has been shown to occur largely independent of the PMF (19Nouwen N. de Kruijff B. Tommassen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5953-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Consistently, the turnover of PrlA4 IMVs was hardly affected by the dissipation of the PMF, yielding a value of 35 molecules of proOmpA/translocation site/min and an apparent K mfor proOmpA of ∼500 nm (Fig. 4 B and TableI).Table IKinetics parameters of protein translocationproOmpASecAATPTurnover aAssuming a SecA dimer per translocation site.Apparent KmApparent KmApparent KmproOmpA/site/minnMnMμmSecYEG4.5 (1.2)180 (280)5045PrlA440 (35)420 (500)Parameters were determined under the conditions described in Fig. 4.

Open table in a new tab Parameters were determined under the conditions described in Fig. 4. Values determined in the presence of the ionophores nigericin/valinomycin are given within brackets. With wild-type SecYEG overexpression IMVs, the apparentK m values for SecA and ATP were determined for the translocation of OG-labeled proOmpA (Fig. 4, C andD). IMVs were treated with urea to inactivate SecA and other ATPases. Urea treatment results in a reduction of the turnover of the translocase from 4.5 to 0.5 proOmpA/translocation site/min, which is only partially caused by the loss of a PMF. The kinetic analysis revealed that for proOmpA translocation, the apparentK m values for SecA and ATP are 50 nm and 45 μm, respectively (Table I). The availability of an efficient in vitro protein translocation system has resulted in major advances in our understanding of bacterial protein secretion. Essentially, this reaction monitors the movement of a translocation-competent precursor protein into the lumen of the isolated inner membrane vesicles or proteoliposomes by their protection against treatment with an externally added protease. Protease-protected polypeptide fragments are visualized by Western blotting or autoradiography and, if necessary, quantified by densitometry. This method allows the detection of fully translocated precursor proteins, processed forms, and even of translocation intermediates of which only the translocated amino-terminal fragments become protected against protease treatment. Because the protease accessibility method is discontinuous,i.e. time points are taken at various intervals, kinetic studies are rather complex. In addition, the visualization is time-consuming (hours to days) and difficult to implement in high throughput drug-screening protocols or other robotics-driven technologies. Here, we show that when a fluorescently labeled proOmpA is used as substrate, protein translocation can be detected more rapidly and even followed in real time. Instead of radiolabeled fragments, the polypeptide bands can be readily detected by in gel fluorescence imaging with a sensitivity that is at least similar to that with radioactivity but requires only a fraction of the time (within a few min). Similar results have been obtained with the fluorescently labeled maltose-binding protein.2 Therefore, the method appears generally applicable for studies on posttranslational translocation. By direct spectroscopic monitoring, the translocation of Oregon Green-labeled proOmpA into the IMVs could also be followed in real time. This probe is rather insensitive to pH and ionic composition of the buffer solution. Conditions that specify an authentic SecA and ATP-dependent reaction yield a time-dependent decrease in the fluorescence, which corresponds to the translocation of the fluorescent precursor into the lumen of the vesicles. A similar phenomenon is observed when proOmpA is labeled with fluorescein or Texas Red. The observed quenching is 1) dependent on the presence of SecYEG, SecA, and hydrolyzable ATP; 2) competitively inhibited by an excess unlabeled proOmpA; and 3) the kinetics of the fluorescence decrease correspond to the kinetics of protein translocation as assayed by the classical protease-protection method. In the case of fluorescein-labeled proOmpA-(Cys-290), the fluorescence signal appeared dependent on the ΔpH. This effect, however, is caused by the acidic luminal pH that reduced the fluorescence quantum yield of translocated labeled precursor protein. Interestingly, this implies that the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein must have crossed the membrane. Therefore, we conclude that the decrease in fluorescence represents an authentic translocation reaction. The exact mechanism of quenching of the fluorescence of the precursor protein during translocation is unclear. The concentrative effect of the translocation reaction that accumulates the precursor protein into a small vesicle lumen could result in self-quenching. However, preliminary rapid mixing experiments suggest that the quenching is observed directly (within the first few seconds) after the onset of translocation, even in the case that the fluorophore is conjugated with a cysteine (Cys-290) in the COOH terminus. Alternatively, the phenomenon may be caused by the presence of intrinsic quenchers in the membrane, although it should be emphasized that the same reaction was observed with SecYEG proteoliposomes formed from isolated E. coli phospholipids. Another possibility is that the environment of the fluorescent probe changes when it is translocated, for instance, as a result of folding at the trans-side of the membrane after the release from the translocation pore. Because the fluorescence quenching is linearly related to the amount of proOmpA molecules translocated, the assay is quantitative and can be used to determine the kinetic parameters for the translocation. The turnover number for the wild-type SecYEG complex is ∼4.5 molecules of proOmpA translocated/site/min, assuming that a translocation site corresponds to a high affinity binding site for the SecA dimer. The apparentK m for proOmpA was 180 nm. The turnover number was reduced >3-fold upon the dissipation of the PMF (19Nouwen N. de Kruijff B. Tommassen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5953-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), without significant change in the apparent K m value. Strikingly, the PrlA4 mutant was found to be almost 10-fold more active as the wild type when saturated with proOmpA, whereas the apparentK m for proOmpA was increased to 420 nm. The kinetic studies confirm that translocation by the PrlA4 mutant is barely affected by the dissipation of the PMF (19Nouwen N. de Kruijff B. Tommassen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5953-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and further demonstrate that the PrlA4 mutant is a highly active translocase. Further kinetic studies on proOmpA translocation showed that the apparent K m for SecA is ∼50 nm, which is ∼3-fold higher as the K d value reported for the binding of SecA to the SecYEG complex (13 nm) (20de Keyzer J. van der Does C. Swaving J. Driessen A.J.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The apparent K m values for proOmpA is in the same range as reported for a chimeric protein containing the signal sequence ofE. coli alkaline phosphatase and the mature portion of staphylococcal nuclease (570 ± 150 nm) as assessed by the precursor protein-stimulated translocation ATPase activity of SecA (21Kourtz L. Oliver D. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1342-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The SecYEG complex forms a protein conducting channel across the membrane, but the exact size of the pore is not known. Various structural studies have shed some light on the possible size limits of the pore. Negative stain electron microscopy and mass measurements with the scanning transmission electron microscope suggest that the SecYEG complex tetramerizes under translocation conditions to form a large ringlike structure with a central 4–5-nm wide stain-filled pit (3Manting E.H. van der Does C. Remigy H. Engel A. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In a recent blue native gel study, trapped precursor proteins were found to associate with a SecYEG dimer (22Veenendaal A.K. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32559-32566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cryoelectronmicroscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction of layered two-dimensional crystals of the dimeric SecYEG complex indicate that this structure lacks a central opening (23Bessonneau P. Besson V. Collinson I. Duong F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, the SecYEG dimer structure either represents a closed state of the translocase or a building block for the assembly of a tetrameric pore-like structure. The ribosome-attached Sec61p complex also forms a ringlike structure with a central opening of ∼2 nm (24Beckmann R. Bubeck D. Grassucci R. Penczek P. Verschoor A. Blobel G. Frank J. Science. 1997; 278: 2123-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these rings accommodate a trimer of the Sec61p complex. Studies on the accessibility of a fluorescent probe that is attached to translocating polypeptide chains to quencher of various sizes (25Hamman B.D. Chen J.C. Johnson E.E. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1997; 89: 535-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) suggest that the channel is large, possibly 4–6 nm under translocation conditions. The pore of the activeE. coli translocase may also be significantly larger than required for the translocation of an unfolded polypeptide chain. Although large folded proteins such as bovine pancreas trypsin inhibitor and dihydrofolate reductase block translocation (7Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 26Arkowitz R.A. Joly J.C. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), a disulfide-bridged polypeptide loop up to 18 amino acid residues in proOmpA can still be transported across the membrane provided that a PMF is present (27Uchida K. Mori H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30862-30868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Our studies with fluorescently labeled proOmpA indicate that a bulky fluorescent dye such as Texas Red (size of 13–16 Å) is readily translocated. Even proOmpA labeled with Texas Red at two consecutive cysteines was tolerated, suggesting that the translocation pore must have a sufficiently wide flexible structure to allow a large variety of chemical groups, even in the absence of a proton motive force. The kinetic data demonstrate that translocation is a rapid event. With the wild-type SecYEG complex, the turnover per SecA dimer is close to one precursor protein every 10 s. A single E. coli cell consists of ∼2,350,000 proteins of which 33% is located in the inner membrane, periplasm, or outer membrane (28Goodsell D.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 203-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In a cell that doubles every 40 min, approximately 20,000 proteins need to be transported across or inserted into the membrane/min (29.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). Assuming that ∼50% of these proteins are indeed translocated (or membrane-inserted) via the SecYEG complex, the experimentally determined turnover number of 4.5 would require ∼2,000 translocation sites. The number of SecY molecules in a cell has been only been estimated at ∼500 (30Matsuyama S. Akimaru J. Mizushima S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), whereas the number of active translocation pores is presumably less as single pore consists of multiple SecYEG complexes. This would mean that the in vitro estimated turnover is insufficient to explain in vivo translocation. However, this value is certainly an underestimate. For instance, intact metabolizing cells maintain a much higher PMF (up to −200 mV) as compared with IMVs with ATP as energy source (approximately −80 mV), whereas other stimulatory factors such as SecDFyajC complex may further add to the activity. Moreover, the in vitro reaction is known to be uncoupled (9Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 31Bassilana M. Arkowitz R.A. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25246-25250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with unproductive translocation initiation events (32van der Wolk J.P. Fekkes P. Boorsma A. Huie J.L. Silhavy T.J. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the use of fluorescently labeled precursor proteins allowed for the first time the real-time monitoring of protein translocation and a direct assessment of kinetic data. This novel method is generally applicable to other protein translocation system and provides new avenues to study protein translocation including single molecule spectroscopy and a high throughput automation of the translocation reaction.

Nature. 1990; 348: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (2358) Google Scholar). Both receptors belong to the large family of GPCRs. The ETA receptor is predominantely expressed in smooth muscle cells, and its stimulation causes a long-lasting vasoconstriction (3Seo B. Oemar B.S. Siebenmann R. von Segesser L. Luscher T.F. Circulation. 1994; 89: 1203-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The ETBreceptor is mainly expressed in endothelial cells, and its activation results in a transient vasodilatation (4De Nucci G. Thomas R.D. Orleans-Juste P. Antunes E. Walder C. Warner T.D. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9797-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar).The ETB receptor displays several unique properties, which are not shared by the ETA receptor or other members of the GPCR family. For example, the ETB receptor binds the ligand ET1 almost irreversibly (5Waggoner W.G. Genova S.L. Rash V.A. Life Sci. 1992; 51: 1869-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The receptor-ligand complex is resistant to acid washes and 2% SDS and even survives SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at low temperature (6Akiyama N. Hiraoka O. Fujii Y. Terashima H. Satoh M. Wada K. Furuichi Y. Protein Expr. Purif. 1992; 3: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In living cells, internalized ET1-ETB receptor complexes remain stable for more than 2 h. This is remarkable, as the ligand-receptor complex is transported into late endosomal/lysosomal compartments within 30 min (7Oksche A. Boese G. Horstmeyer A. Furkert J. Beyermann M. Bienert M. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1104-1113PubMed Google Scholar, 8Oksche A. Boese G. Horstmeyer A. Papsdorf G. Furkert J. Beyermann M. Bienert M. Rosenthal W. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2000; 36: S44-S47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The tight binding of ET1 to the ETB receptor is evolutionary conserved, since it was also observed for the ETB receptor of calf, dog, mouse, and guinea pig (9Takasuka T. Sakurai T. Goto K. Furuichi Y. Watanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7509-7513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies revealed that aspartate 75 and proline 93 within the extracellular N terminus of the human ETB receptor are important determinants for the formation of a stable ligand/receptor complex (9Takasuka T. Sakurai T. Goto K. Furuichi Y. Watanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7509-7513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological significance of this tight receptor/ligand association is still not understood. Recently it was shown that the ETB receptor is crucially involved in the regulation of circulating ET1 plasma levels: blockade of the ETB receptor causes a significant increase in ET1 plasma levels (10Fukuroda T. Fujikawa T. Ozaki S. Ishikawa K. Yano M. Nishikibe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 11Dupuis J. Goresky C.A. Fournier A. J. Appl. Physiol. 1996; 81: 1510-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Thus, the tight binding of ET1 to the ETBreceptor and the transport of the receptor/ligand complex into lysosomal compartments could provide a molecular basis for the efficient removal of ET1 from the circulation.The ETB receptor possesses a cleavable signal peptide (comprising 26 amino acids), which is removed in the ER lumen during receptor biosynthesis (6Akiyama N. Hiraoka O. Fujii Y. Terashima H. Satoh M. Wada K. Furuichi Y. Protein Expr. Purif. 1992; 3: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 12Saito Y. Mizuno T. Itakura M. Suzuki Y. Ito T.

Chem. 2002; 277: 16131-16138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition to the removal of the signal peptide, the N terminus of the mature protein undergoes proteolytical cleavage. Protein analysis of purified ETBreceptors from human placenta revealed two different isoforms: (i) a full-length receptor comprising 416 amino acids (after removal of the signal peptide) and starting with glutamate 27, and (ii) an N-terminal-truncated ETB receptor, comprising 378 amino acids and starting with serine 65 (6, 14). The existence of the two ETB receptor isoforms has been demonstrated for the dog, pig, and calf receptor, indicating that the proteolytical processing of the mature ETB receptor is evolutionary conserved (12Saito Y.

Thus, the N-terminal proteolysis yields unglycosylated ETBreceptors.So far, the mechanism and physiological significance of the N-terminal proteolysis are unknown. In order to elucidate them, we generated HEK293 cells stably or transiently expressing the wild-type ETB receptor or fusion proteins consisting of the ETB receptor and GFP fused to the C terminus of the receptor. In addition, we analyzed an N-terminal-truncated ETB receptor-GFP fusion protein (corresponding to the N-terminal-cleaved isoform) or receptor-GFP fusion proteins with amino acid exchanges at the N-terminal cleavage site, to determine the requirements and the functional consequences of N-terminal receptor cleavage. Our data suggest that the ETB receptor is cleaved by a metalloprotease at the plasma membrane in an agonist-dependent process.DISCUSSIONMany type I and II integral membrane proteins (proteins with a single membrane spanning domain, classification according to Ref. 28Singer S.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 247-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and several GPI-anchored proteins undergo limited proteolysis. The release of the ectodomain either generates a soluble, circulating form of the protein with normal or slightly altered functional properties, or mediates down-regulation. Different classes of proteins are susceptible to limited proteolysis, such as ectoenzymes (e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme; Refs. 29Oppong S.Y. Hooper N.M. Biochem.

The proteases mediating the release of the soluble proteins are termed membrane protein secretases, membrane protein convertases, or sheddases. Many secretases are metalloproteases or serine proteases (for review see Refs. 37Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem.

In the case of protease-activated receptors (PARs), the serine proteases thrombin (PAR1, PAR3, PAR4) and trypsin (PAR2) cleave the extracellular N terminus, thereby generating a new N terminus, which functions as a tethered ligand (39Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar, 40Schmidlin F. Bunnett N.W. Curr. Opin.

Other examples are the vasopressin V2 receptor, the β2-adrenergic receptor and the TSH receptor. In the case of the vasopressin V2 and the β2-adrenergic receptor, metalloproteases cleave the activated receptor, thereby promoting down-regulation. The vasopressin V2 receptor is cleaved within the second transmembrane domain (at E92↓V93; Ref. 42Kojro E. Fahrenholz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6476-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The cleavage site within the β2-adrenergic receptor has not been determined (43Jockers R. Angers S., Da Silva A. Benaroch P. Strosberg A.D. Bouvier M. Marullo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28900-28908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In case of the TSH receptor, spontanous release of the highly glycosylated extracellular N terminus was observed (44Couet J. Sar S. Jolivet A., Vu Hai M.T. Milgrom E. Misrahi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4545-4552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The release was promoted slightly by TSH, phorbol esters, and forskolin. Its physiological importance is not yet understood.We show here that the ETB receptor is expressed as a full-length receptor at the cell surface and that N-terminal proteolysis is induced by binding of ET1 to the receptor. The N-terminal cleavage is almost complete within 60 min (see Fig. 5). The sensitivity of the proteolysis to EDTA, phenanthroline, and metalloprotease inhibitors (batimastat and TACE-inhibitor Ro 32-7315) points to an involvement of a metalloprotease. Batimastat and Ro 32-7315 block a variety of different metalloproteases, including MMPs and members of a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) family (45Wojtowicz-Praga S.M. Dickson R.B. Hawkins M.J. Invest. New Drugs. 1997; 15: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 46Maskos K. Fernandez-Catalan C. Huber R. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Ellestad G.A. Reddy P. Wolfson M.F.

Specific metalloprotease inhibitors are only available for gelatinases A and B (MMP-2 and MMP-9, respectively). Ro 28-2653, which inhibits gelatinase A and B did not inhibit N-terminal proteolysis, indicating that these types of metalloproteases are not involved. Thus the exact identity of metalloprotease involved remains elusive. The ligand-induced cleavage also occurred in the presence of sucrose or phenylarsine oxide. Therefore, it does not dependent on receptor internalization and is mediated by an extracellularly acting soluble or a membrane-bound metalloprotease. Considering the fact that the ETB receptor is quantitatively removed from the cell surface within 30 min (7Oksche A. Boese G. Horstmeyer A. Furkert J. Beyermann M. Bienert M. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1104-1113PubMed Google Scholar) and that the N-terminal proteolysis requires about 60 min (this study), it is possible that the metalloprotease is internalized together with the receptor/ligand complex (compare Figs. 5and 9).To generate a mutant ETB receptor resistant to proteolytical cleavage, we mutated the cleavage site R64↓S65 (R64H-S65A mutant) or a stretch of 9 amino acids surrounding the R64↓S65 motif (HIS mutant, see Fig. 1). However, neither modification prevented ligand-induced N-terminal proteolysis. Thus, the cleavage appears to be independent of the primary sequence. This result is in line with several reports on the proteolysis of integral membrane proteins by metalloproteases. For example, the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by α-secretase 12 amino acids distal of the transmembrane domain (K16↓L17). The cleavage still occurs when the cleavage site is mutated or deleted. Further studies revealed a dependence of the cleavage on an α-helical conformation and the distance of the cleavage site from the plasma membrane (48Esch F.S. Keim P.S. Beattie E.C. Blacher R.W.

A. 1992; 89: 6075-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). L-selectin cleavage (K321↓S322) also depended on the distance of the cleavage site from the plasma membrane, but not on the amino acid sequence (Refs. 37Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar and 38Schlöndorff J. Blobel C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3603-3617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, for review see Refs. 50Chen A.

Med. 1995; 182: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).The physiological role of the N-terminal cleavage of the ETB receptor is not clear. The ligand-dependence of this process favor the involvement in receptor activation or down-regulation. However, the proteolysis does not destroy receptor function and the overall structure, as is the case for the vasopressin V2 receptor or the β2-adrenergic receptor (42Kojro E. Fahrenholz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6476-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 43Jockers R. Angers S., Da Silva A. Benaroch P. Strosberg A.D. Bouvier M. Marullo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28900-28908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Rather it generates a new N terminus, similar to the PAR family, although the new N terminus (SLAPAE) of the ETBreceptor does not share sequence similarity with that of the of PAR1, PAR2, and PAR4 receptors (SFLLRN/TFLLR, SLIGRL, and GYPGKF, respectively). We cannot exclude a role of the cleavage in cross-activation of another, yet unidentified receptor by the ETB receptor. Such a cross-activation of PAR4 receptors by thrombin via PAR3 receptors has recently been described (cofactor-assisted PAR activation; Ref. 52Nakanishi-Matsui M. Zheng Y.W. Sulciner D.J. Weiss E.J. Ludeman M.J. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the new N terminus of the truncated ETB receptor (38 amino acids) is similar in length to those of the PAR family (about 23–72 amino acids).It is also possible that the N-terminal cleavage causes a conformational change, leading to a more efficient interaction with proteins regulating cell surface expression (e.g. adapter proteins). In transient transfection experiments the truncated [Δ2–64]ETB receptor revealed a 15-fold lower cell surface expression than the wild-type receptor. It is possible that N-terminal proteolysis promotes the retrieval of receptors from the cell surface, e.g. by leading to an exposure of endocytotic transport motifs. As the ETB receptor possesses a cleavable signal peptide, which is required for the proper translocation of the nascent receptor across the ER membrane (13Köchl R. Alken M. Rutz C. Krause G. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Schülein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16131-16138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the reduced cell surface expression may also be caused by the lack of the signal peptide. This problem cannot be addressed by generating an ETB receptor possessing the signal peptide but lacking amino acids 27–64, as cleavage of the signal peptide depends on the length of the N terminus and the amino acids sequence surrounding the signal peptidase cleavage site. 2A. Oksche, R. Schülein, and W. Rosenthal, unpublished results. The ETB receptor represents the first example of a type III membrane protein that is cleaved by a metalloprotease and retains its function. In contrast, in the case of the vasopressin V2 receptor and the β2-adrenergic receptor the stuctural integrity of the heptahelical receptor is destroyed, and in the case of the TSH receptor the ligand binding domain is lost. At present the functional significance of the N-terminal cleavage is not known. Future experiments designed to examine cross-activation of other GPCRs by the ETB receptor and to evaluate the role of the released N terminus (38 amino acids) may be rewarding. Endothelins, which exist in three isoforms, exert their action via two endothelin receptor subtypes: (i) the endothelin A (ETA) 1The abbreviations used are: ET, endothelin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Cy3.5, Cyanin3.5; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium; ERK, extracellular-regulated kinase; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HEK293, human embryonal kidney 293; LT-PAGE, low temperature-PAGE; PAR, protease-activated receptor; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; TACE, TNFα-converting enzyme; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone; MMP, matrix metalloprotease; RIA, radioimmunoassay 1The abbreviations used are: ET, endothelin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Cy3.5, Cyanin3.5; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium; ERK, extracellular-regulated kinase; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HEK293, human embryonal kidney 293; LT-PAGE, low temperature-PAGE; PAR, protease-activated receptor; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; TACE, TNFα-converting enzyme; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone; MMP, matrix metalloprotease; RIA, radioimmunoassayand (ii) the endothelin B (ETB) receptor (1Arai H.

Nature. 1990; 348: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (2358) Google Scholar). Both receptors belong to the large family of GPCRs. The ETA receptor is predominantely expressed in smooth muscle cells, and its stimulation causes a long-lasting vasoconstriction (3Seo B. Oemar B.S. Siebenmann R. von Segesser L. Luscher T.F. Circulation. 1994; 89: 1203-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The ETBreceptor is mainly expressed in endothelial cells, and its activation results in a transient vasodilatation (4De Nucci G. Thomas R.D. Orleans-Juste P. Antunes E. Walder C. Warner T.D. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9797-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). The ETB receptor displays several unique properties, which are not shared by the ETA receptor or other members of the GPCR family. For example, the ETB receptor binds the ligand ET1 almost irreversibly (5Waggoner W.G. Genova S.L. Rash V.A. Life Sci. 1992; 51: 1869-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The receptor-ligand complex is resistant to acid washes and 2% SDS and even survives SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at low temperature (6Akiyama N. Hiraoka O. Fujii Y. Terashima H. Satoh M. Wada K. Furuichi Y. Protein Expr. Purif. 1992; 3: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In living cells, internalized ET1-ETB receptor complexes remain stable for more than 2 h. This is remarkable, as the ligand-receptor complex is transported into late endosomal/lysosomal compartments within 30 min (7Oksche A. Boese G. Horstmeyer A. Furkert J. Beyermann M. Bienert M. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1104-1113PubMed Google Scholar, 8Oksche A. Boese G. Horstmeyer A. Papsdorf G. Furkert J. Beyermann M. Bienert M. Rosenthal W. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2000; 36: S44-S47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The tight binding of ET1 to the ETB receptor is evolutionary conserved, since it was also observed for the ETB receptor of calf, dog, mouse, and guinea pig (9Takasuka T. Sakurai T. Goto K. Furuichi Y. Watanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7509-7513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies revealed that aspartate 75 and proline 93 within the extracellular N terminus of the human ETB receptor are important determinants for the formation of a stable ligand/receptor complex (9Takasuka T. Sakurai T. Goto K. Furuichi Y. Watanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7509-7513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological significance of this tight receptor/ligand association is still not understood. Recently it was shown that the ETB receptor is crucially involved in the regulation of circulating ET1 plasma levels: blockade of the ETB receptor causes a significant increase in ET1 plasma levels (10Fukuroda T. Fujikawa T. Ozaki S. Ishikawa K. Yano M. Nishikibe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 11Dupuis J. Goresky C.A. Fournier A. J. Appl. Physiol. 1996; 81: 1510-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Thus, the tight binding of ET1 to the ETBreceptor and the transport of the receptor/ligand complex into lysosomal compartments could provide a molecular basis for the efficient removal of ET1 from the circulation. The ETB receptor possesses a cleavable signal peptide (comprising 26 amino acids), which is removed in the ER lumen during receptor biosynthesis (6Akiyama N. Hiraoka O. Fujii Y. Terashima H. Satoh M. Wada K. Furuichi Y. Protein Expr. Purif. 1992; 3: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 12Saito Y. Mizuno T. Itakura M. Suzuki Y. Ito T. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 16131-16138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition to the removal of the signal peptide, the N terminus of the mature protein undergoes proteolytical cleavage. Protein analysis of purified ETBreceptors from human placenta revealed two different isoforms: (i) a full-length receptor comprising 416 amino acids (after removal of the signal peptide) and starting with glutamate 27, and (ii) an N-terminal-truncated ETB receptor, comprising 378 amino acids and starting with serine 65 (6, 14). The existence of the two ETB receptor isoforms has been demonstrated for the dog, pig, and calf receptor, indicating that the proteolytical processing of the mature ETB receptor is evolutionary conserved (12Saito Y.

Pept. 1991; 32: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The proteolytically released N-terminal peptide fragment harbors the only N-linked glycosylation. Thus, the N-terminal proteolysis yields unglycosylated ETBreceptors. So far, the mechanism and physiological significance of the N-terminal proteolysis are unknown. In order to elucidate them, we generated HEK293 cells stably or transiently expressing the wild-type ETB receptor or fusion proteins consisting of the ETB receptor and GFP fused to the C terminus of the receptor. In addition, we analyzed an N-terminal-truncated ETB receptor-GFP fusion protein (corresponding to the N-terminal-cleaved isoform) or receptor-GFP fusion proteins with amino acid exchanges at the N-terminal cleavage site, to determine the requirements and the functional consequences of N-terminal receptor cleavage. Our data suggest that the ETB receptor is cleaved by a metalloprotease at the plasma membrane in an agonist-dependent process. DISCUSSIONMany type I and II integral membrane proteins (proteins with a single membrane spanning domain, classification according to Ref. 28Singer S.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 247-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and several GPI-anchored proteins undergo limited proteolysis. The release of the ectodomain either generates a soluble, circulating form of the protein with normal or slightly altered functional properties, or mediates down-regulation. Different classes of proteins are susceptible to limited proteolysis, such as ectoenzymes (e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme; Refs. 29Oppong S.Y. Hooper N.M. Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W2318564252,"Chemical inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) have a great therapeutic potential against various proliferative and neurodegenerative disorders. Intensive screening of a combinatorial chemistry library of 2,6,9-trisubstituted purines has led to the identification of purvalanol, one of the most potent and selective CDK inhibitors to date. In preliminary studies, this compound demonstrates definite anti-mitotic properties, consistent with its nanomolar range efficiency towards purified CDK1 and CDK2. However, the actual intracellular targets of purvalanol remain to be identified, and a method for the determination of its in vivo selectivity was developed. In this technique, cell extracts were screened for purvalanol-interacting proteins by affinity chromatography on immobilized inhibitor. In addition to CDK1, p42/p44 MAPK were found to be two major purvalanol-interacting proteins in five different mammalian cell lines (CCL39, PC12, HBL100, MCF-7 and Jurkat cells), suggesting the generality of the purvalanol/p42/p44 MAPK interaction. The Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line CCL39 was used as a model to investigate the anti-proliferative properties of purvalanol. The compound inhibited cell growth with a GI50 value of 2.5 μM and induced a G2/M block when added to exponentially growing cells. It did not appear to trigger massive activation of caspase. We next tested whether CDKs and p42/p44 MAPK were actually targeted by the compound in vivo. p42/p44 MAPK activity was visualized using an Elk–Gal4 luciferase reporter system and CDK1 activity was detected by the phosphonucleolin level. When cells were treated with purvalanol, p42/p44 MAPK and CDK1 activities were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, purvalanol inhibited the nuclear accumulation of p42/p44 MAPK, an event dependent on the catalytic activity of these kinases. We conclude that the anti-proliferative properties of purvalanol are mediated by inhibition of both p42/p44 MAPK and CDKs. These observations highlight the potency of moderate selectivity compounds and encourage the search for new therapeutics which simultaneously target distinct but relevant pathways of cell proliferation."

The purified leptin-binding domain (LBD) exhibited the predicted beta structure, was capable of binding human, ovine, and chicken leptins, and formed a stable 1:1 complex with all mammalian leptins. The binding kinetics, assayed by surface plasmon resonance methodology, showed respective k(on) and k(off) values (mean +/- S.E.) of 1.20 +/- 0.23 x 10(-5) mol(-1) s(-1) and 1.85 +/- 0.30 x 10(-3) s(-1) and a K(d) value of 1.54 x 10(-8) m. Similar results were achieved with conventional binding experiments. LBD blocked leptin-induced, but not interleukin-3-induced, proliferation of BAF/3 cells stably transfected with the long form of human leptin receptor. The modeled LBD structure and the known three-dimensional structure of human leptin were used to construct a model of 1:1 LBD.human leptin complex. Two main residues, Phe-500, located in loop L3, and Tyr-441, located in L1, are suggested to contribute to leptin binding."
https://openalex.org/W2331825483,"We previously reported that overexpression of the 24 kDa basic fibroblast factor (or FGF-2) isoform provides protection from the cytotoxic effect of ionizing radiation (IR). DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), the IR-induced lethal lesions, are mainly repaired in human cells by non-homologous end joining system (NHEJ). NHEJ reaction is dependent on the DNA-PK holoenzyme (composed of a regulatory sub-unit, Ku, and a catalytic sub-unit, DNA-PKcs) that assembles at sites of DNA damage. We demonstrated here that the activity of DNA-PK was increased by twofold in two independent radioresistant cell lines, HeLa 3A and CAPAN A3, overexpressing the 24 kDa FGF-2. This increase was associated with an overexpression of the DNA-PKcs without modification of Ku expression or activity. This overexpression was due to an up-regulation of the DNA-PKcs gene transcription by the 24 kDa FGF-2 isoform. Finally, HeLa 3A cells exhibited the hallmarks of phenotypic changes associated with the overexpression of an active DNA-PKcs. Indeed, a faster repair rate of DSB and sensitization to IR by wortmannin was observed in these cells. Our results represent the characterization of a new mechanism of control of DNA repair and radioresistance in human tumor cells dependent on the overproduction of the 24 kDa FGF-2 isoform."

Despite intensive research, the molecular mechanisms underlying apoptosis mediated by c-Myc are yet to be understood. It has been proposed that c-Myc induces apoptosis by up-regulating its target genes, such as those expressing ornitine decarboxylase (8Bello-Fernandez C. Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Moreover, at least in tumor cells, not only the over-expression of c-myc but also its down-regulation induces apoptosis (16Skorski T. Nieborowska-Skorska M. Campbell K. Iozzo R.V. Zon G.

In particular, it has been demonstrated extensively that apoptosis is stimulated by cell depletion of GSH (26van den Dobbelsteen D.J. Nobel C.S.I. Schlegel J. Cotgreave I.A. Orrenius S. Slater A.F.G.

Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5965) Google Scholar). In this context we demonstrated that following apoptogenic stimuli that do not directly elicit an oxidative stress, GSH is extruded from the cells at very early stages of the process (29Ghibelli L. Coppola S. Rotilio G. Lafavia E. Maresca V. Ciriolo M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and that the inhibition of the extrusion of GSH prevents apoptosis (30Ghibelli L. Fanelli C. Rotilio G. Lafavia E. Coppola S. Colussi C. Civitareale P. Ciriolo M.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Moreover, we evidenced that the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria followed cell depletion of GSH, independently of the destiny of the cells,i.e. apoptosis or survival (31Ghibelli L. Coppola S. Fanelli C. Rotilio G. Civitareale A. Scovassi I. Ciriolo M.R. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2031-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The present study aims at dissecting the molecular mechanism by which down-regulation of c-Myc induces apoptosis, with the expectation of identifying new molecular factors that may represent therapeutic targets in reestablishing apoptotic pathways in cancer cells. We demonstrate that down-regulation of c-Myc triggers apoptosis in stable and doxycycline-inducible clones of M14 melanoma cells through a canonical redox-mediated pathway involving depletion of GSH and release of cytochrome c as early events, whereas production of ROS and activation of caspases are late effectors. Decrease of GSH results from an impairment of both its synthesis and GSSG reduction. The key role of GSH in the apoptosis induced by down-regulation of c-Myc is further supported by the ability of Cys-NAc or GSH ester to suppress the commitment of cells to death. The stable M14 melanoma transfectants (MAS51 and MAS53 c-Myc low expressing clones and MN2 control clone) were obtained by transfection with an expression vector carrying antisense c-myc cDNA and/or a selection marker gene (23Biroccio A. Benassi B. Amodei S. Gabellini C. Del Bufalo D. Zupi G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The M14-derived doxycycline-inducible clones expressing low c-Myc (MAS IND1 and MAS IND18) were obtained by a double transfection with a commercial inducible TET-ON gene expression system (Clontech, Florence, Italy) consisting of two expression vectors, a regulator and a response one carrying c-myc cDNA (exon 2 + exon 3) in the antisense orientation. Doxycycline (1 μg/ml, administered every 24 h) down-regulates c-Myc protein in about 72 h by 50–60% in both clones as compared with uninduced transfectants. DTT, EDTA, EGTA, PIPES disodium salt, potassium borohydride, GSH ethyl ester, l-glutamate,l-α-aminobutyrate, and Cys-NAc were obtained from Sigma. GSH, GSSG, ATP disodium salt, phosphoenolpyruvate, NADH, NADPH, and pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other chemicals were obtained from Merck. For ROS content, adherent cells were first assayed for viability and then incubated with 4 μm dihydroethidium (DHE, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 45 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Apoptosis was evaluated by annexin V versus PI assay. Cells were harvested, suspended in annexin-binding buffer (1 × 106 cells/ml), incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-annexin V and PI (Molecular Probes) for 15 min at room temperature in the dark, and then immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. The annexin V positive/PI negative (annexin V+/PI−) cells were considered apoptotic. Activity levels of caspase-9 and -3 were evaluated using a CaspaTagTM Kit according to the manufacturer's instruction (Intergen, Oxford, UK). Cells were harvested and resuspended in fresh medium (1 × 106 cells/ml). The specific fluorescent caspase substrate was added directly to the cell suspension and left for 1 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and protected from the light. After washing, cells were stained with PI and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation at 700 × g for 7 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer containing 220 mmmannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 50 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. After a 30-min incubation on ice, cells were homogenized with a glass Dounce homogenizer. Cell homogenates were spun at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were removed and stored at −80 °C until analysis by gel electrophoresis. 20 μg of cytosolic protein extracts were loaded onto each lane of a 12% SDS-PAGE, separated, and then blotted to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Purified mouse anti-cytochromec antibody (clone 7H8.2c12, Pharmingen) was used as primary antibody (1: 5,000). The specific protein complex, formed upon anti-mouse secondary antibody treatment (1:10,000), was identified using SuperSignal substrate chemiluminescence reagent. 40 μg of total proteins were loaded from each sample on denaturing 12% SDS-PAGE. Immunodetection of PARP, γ-GCS, c-Myc, and β-actin were performed using rabbit anti-PARP (1:2000, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), rabbit anti-γ-GCS (1:1000; provided by Dr. A. Cantin, Service de pneumologie, CHUS-Fleurimont), mouse anti-c-Myc (1:1000, clone 9E-10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and mouse anti-actin (1:1000, clone AC-40, Sigma) antibodies. ECL was used for detection. For intracellular glutathione determination, cell monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended, and lysed by repeated cycles of freezing and thawing under liquid nitrogen. Lysates were acidified with 5%meta-phosphoric acid and centrifuged at 22,300 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. Low molecular weight free thiols were derivatized to S-carboxymethyl derivatives upon treatment of supernatants with iodoacetic acid. GSH and GSSG concentrations were determined by the conversion of free amino groups to 2,4-dinitrophenyl derivatives by the reaction with 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. Low molecular weight thiols were, finally, separated by HPLC using a μBondapak NH2 column (Waters) as described by Reed et al. (32Reed D.J. Babson J.R. Beatty P.W. Brodie A.E. Ellis W.W. Potter D.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). GSH and GSSG were used as external standards. Data were expressed as nmol/mg protein. For the extracellular glutathione assay, culture media were collected and centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in order to discard detached cells. Media were then acidified and treated as described before. Data were expressed in nmol/ml. Total RNA was isolated from exponentially growing cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) following standard protocols and quantified spectrophotometrically. Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from 50 μg of total RNA using the Oligotex mRNA purification system (Qiagen, Milano, Italy) and retrotranscribed to cDNAs in the presence of [32P]dATP (Amersham Biosciences) using a mixture of specific oligonucleotides (Clontech). Equal amounts of labeled cDNAs were hybridized to filters containing 1200 genes (ATLAS 1.2 human Cancer, Clontech). After being washed, the filters were autoradiographed, and gene expression patterns were evaluated using the ATALS Image software (Clontech). Expression intensities were considered comparable only if at least one of the two samples (c-Myc low expressing clone and control clone) had intensity greater than 2-fold the background value. Three macroarrays were performed for MN2 control clone, and the values for each gene were averaged. γ-GCS was assayed as described by Seelig and Meister (33Seelig G.F. Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The cell pellet was lysed in 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 8, containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm dithiothreitol and centrifuged at 12,550 ×g for 30 min. Supernantants were used for γ-GCS determination following oxidation of NADH at 340 nm in 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 150 mm KCl, 5 mm Na2-ATP, 2 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 10 mml-glutamate, 10 mml-α-aminobutyrate, 20 mmMgCl2, 2 mm Na2-EDTA, 0.2 mm NADH and 17 μg of pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase. Data were expressed as nmol of NADH oxidized/mg of protein. GSSG reductase activity was monitored spectrophotometrically, as described previously (34Freedman J.H. Ciriolo M.R. Peisach J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5598-5605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by following the changes in absorbance at 340 nm due to the oxidation of NADPH and using as substrates 0.17 mm NADPH and 2.2 mm GSSG in 100 mmphosphate buffer, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, at 37 °C. Data were expressed as nmol of NADPH oxidized/mg of protein. The results are presented as means ± S.D. Significant changes were assessed using Student'st test for unpaired data, and p values < 0.05 were considered significant. Two M14 melanoma transfectants (MAS51 and MAS53) expressing 6–10 times less c-Myc protein than the control clone (MN2) and M14 parental line (23Biroccio A. Benassi B. Amodei S. Gabellini C. Del Bufalo D. Zupi G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) were employed. By means of the annexin V versus PI staining assay (Fig.1 A), we demonstrated that MAS51 and MAS53 clones showed spontaneous apoptosis, which increased from about 6% on day 2 to about 40% on day 6. On the contrary, no apoptosis was observed in either of the control lines for up to 6 days of growth. On day 4 of growth, when about 15% of apoptosis was evident in both MAS51 and MAS53 transfectants, the values of GSH were significantly lower (p < 0.01) than both the M14 and MN2 control cells, with a concomitant significant increase (p < 0.05) in the GSSG form of the tripeptide, whereas mixed disulfides between glutathione and cysteine residues of proteins were undetectable (Fig. 1 B). Fig.2 A shows that GSH content was significantly different as early as 2 and 3 days of growth (*,p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01), far ahead of the time when the apoptotic process was activated, indicating that its decrease represents an upstream event in the induction of apoptosis.Figure 2The decrease of GSH is an early event in the induction of apoptosis.HPLC analysis of intracellular GSH (A), intracellular GSSG (B), and extracellular GSH content (C) was performed in M14 (black columns), MN2 (dark gray columns), MAS51 (light gray columns), and MAS53 (white columns) cells. On the indicated days, cells and media were treated for glutathione determinations as described under “Experimental Procedures” (n = 10); *, p < 0.05; **,p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The steady state level of GSH in the cell results from a balance between the rates of synthesis and loss of the tripeptide via oxidation or excretion. Under our experimental conditions we detected an increase in intracellular GSSG content as early as 2 days of growth (Fig.2 B); this increase is commonly observed when cells are oxidatively stressed. This evidence could, at least in part, provide an explanation for the lower levels of GSH present in MAS51 and MAS53 clones. On the other hand, a significant increase in GSH content was determined in the culture media of these clones (Fig.2 C) on days 3 and 4 of growth (p < 0.01and 0.001, respectively). In search of a mechanism responsible for the early alterations observed in GSH content following down-regulation of c-Myc, we monitored two key enzymes determining the balance of glutathione forms in the cells: γ-GCS, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH synthesis, and the NADPH-dependent GSSG reductase, which is responsible for efficient back-reduction of GSSG to GSH. Fig.3 shows the activity (panel A) and protein levels (panel B) of γ-GCS. The results show a significant decrease in activity (about 40%) as early as day 2 of growth, with no further decrement in either the MAS51 or MAS53 transfectant when compared with the MN2 and M14 parental line. These data are in line with the protein concentration of the two subunits of the synthetase, the heavy catalytic (γ-GCSH) and the light regulatory (γ-GCSL) subunit, as assayed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3 B). Similarly, the activity of GSSG reductase showed a significant decrease in both of the clones expressing low c-Myc (Fig. 3 C), thus correlating well with the changes in GSSG content observed in the MAS51 and MAS53 transfectants as compared with control lines. The dependence of gene expression profiles on c-Myc was analyzed by macroarray technology (Fig. 4). The figure shows that many genes are down-regulated in the clones expressing low c-Myc with respect to control, including c-myc itself and many genes already known as targets of c-Myc. In particular, down-regulation of c-Myc induced a significant reduction of genes of enzymes related to the metabolism of glutathione: γ-GCS, NADPH-dependent GSSG reductase, glutathioneS-transferase-μ1, -θ1, and -A1, and microsomal glutathione S-transferase II. Production of ROS (Fig.5 A) progressively increased in the clones expressing low c-Myc after 4 days of growth, reaching significant values (35% more than in control cells) on day 6 of culture. On the contrary, no detectable ROS were produced in the M14 and MN2 control clones during the days of culture. Neither caspase-9 nor caspase-3 was activated until day 4 of growth in all of the cell lines analyzed, regardless of c-Myc expression (Fig. 5 B). The proteolytic cleavage of the 116-kDa PARP to an 89-kDa product appeared only in MAS51 and MAS53 cells on day 6 of culture, concomitantly with the activation of both caspases (Fig.5 C). On the contrary, cytochrome c release from mitochondria was detectable as early as day 2 of growth (Fig.5 D). The release was concomitant with a decrease in GSH and preceded the surface exposure of phosphatidylserine, as specifically detected by annexin V staining (see Fig. 1 A). When Cys-NAc (5 mm), which is known to support GSH synthesis, or GSH ester (5 mm) was added to transfectants with low c-Myc on day 1 of growth and left in the medium for the following 24 h, the intracellular GSH content was increased to levels as high as those assayed in M14 cells on day 2 of growth (Fig. 6 A). This effect was maintained for the following days of growth (data not shown) and caused a reduction of apoptosis (Fig. 6 B). The reversing ability of Cys-NAc and GSH ester was not due to increased expression of c-Myc (Fig. 6 C). As soon as the GSH concentration rose following both treatments, cytochrome cwas not efficiently accumulated in the cytosol (Fig. 6 D). Although both treatments partially reversed the induction of apoptosis in both clones with low c-Myc, the Cys-NAc treatment only was able to completely abolish the intracellular ROS production, whereas the administration of GSH ester reduced it by about 50%. The activities of caspase-9 and caspase-3 were significantly reduced following Cys-NAc or GSH ester treatment, the proteolytic activity being less than 10%. To ascertain whether cell depletion of GSH and induction of the apoptotic program were actually specific events of down-regulation of c-Myc, we generated M14 doxycycline-inducible clones (named MAS IND 1 and MAS IND 18). Both clones, following doxycycline administration, showed a reduction in the protein levels of c-Myc (50–60%) (Fig. 7 A) and a concomitant decrease in GSH content (Fig. 7 B). Moreover, a time-dependent increase in the percentage of annexin V+ cells was detected starting from 24 h after c-Myc down-regulation (Fig. 7 B). Subsequent to cell depletion of glutathione, cytochrome c was released from mitochondria, leading to the induction of the downstream events of apoptosis such as production of ROS and activation of caspase-9 and -3 (data not shown). The biological effects of c-Myc are clearly due to its ability to affect gene transcription both positively and negatively. Current evidence is in agreement with the notion that deregulation of cell growth and proliferation is critically affected in c-Myc-related tumorigenesis. It is also clear that c-Myc controls or affects other processes that may be highly relevant to its tumorigenic action. In the present report we demonstrate that down-regulation of c-Myc commits melanoma cells to apoptosis via alteration of the GSH balance in the cell at two key points: GSH biosynthesis and GSH regeneration from GSSG reduction. In fact, by using stable and doxycycline-inducible M14 melanoma cells, we found that the down-regulation of c-Myc induced a decrease in the intracellular GSH content with a concomitant accumulation of its oxidized form. The process is strictly related to down-regulation of c-Myc and not to GSH loss from the dying cells, as clearly evidenced by the kinetics of the appearance of apoptotic cells. We and other authors have demonstrated previously that GSH is efficiently extruded from cells undergoing programmed cell death (26van den Dobbelsteen D.J. Nobel C.S.I. Schlegel J. Cotgreave I.A.

The observed imbalance in the redox equilibrium of GSH is due to down-regulation of two key enzymes of glutathione metabolism, along with changes observed in other gene transcription, that, as expected, are more related to cell cycle regulators (40Menssen A. Hermeking H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6274-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In this context, it should be remembered that another gene involved in redox regulation has recently been reported to be a target of c-Myc, i.e. PRDX3, encoding a mitochondrial protein of the peroxiredoxin family (41Wonsey D.R. Zeller K.I. Dang C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6649-6654Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). As far as γ-GCS and NADPH-dependent GSSG reductase enzyme regulation is concerned, there are no data demonstrating a direct transcriptional regulation of these genes by c-Myc. The results obtained with transient down-regulation of c-Myc (Fig. 7) strongly favor this hypothesis. A rapid decrease of intracellular GSH following deregulation of GSH biosynthesis has recently been demonstrated to be the result of cleavage of the catalytic subunit of γ-GCS by caspase-3 during apoptotic cell death (42Franklin C.C. Krejsa C.M. Pierce R.H. White C.C. Fausto N. Kavanagh T.J. Am J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 1887-1894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, under our experimental conditions, the activation of caspase-3 was significant only after 6 days of growth, whereas a decrement in both the protein and activity levels of γ-GCS was detectable as early as 2 days of growth, thus indicating that these decreases are probably a direct consequence of down-regulation of c-Myc. Moreover, the reduction of intracellular GSH content is aggravated by efficient extrusion of GSH, observed as early as 2 days of growth, before the execution of apoptosis. These results are in agreement with previous data demonstrating that cells stimulated to undergo apoptosis get rid of their GSH to allow apoptosis to take place (30Ghibelli L. Fanelli C. Rotilio G. Lafavia E. Coppola S. Colussi C. Civitareale P. Ciriolo M.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). However, we previously found that GSH loss may be necessary but not sufficient for triggering apoptosis, because in lowering the GSH content of the cell by l-buthionine-sulfoximine and diethyl maleate we were not able to induce apoptosis in U937 or HepG2 cells (30Ghibelli L. Fanelli C. Rotilio G. Lafavia E. Coppola S. Colussi C. Civitareale P. Ciriolo M.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may depend on cell context or on the modality by which GSH is lost; some cell types may adapt slowly to a situation of GSH deprivation by setting up other ways of maintaining a correct redox equilibrium, whereas other types, including melanomas, are particularly sensitive to depletion of GSH (43Fruehauf J.P. Zonis S. al-Bassam M. Kyshtoobayeva A. Dasgupta C. Milovanovic T. Parker R.J. Buzaid A.C. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 112: 277-305Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 44Fruehauf J.P.

In our experimental model, the decrease in GSH is strictly associated to apoptosis, because supplementation with Cys-NAc or with GSH ester inhibited apoptosis. Cell depletion of GSH caused by down-regulation of c-Myc is linked closely to mitochondrial dysfunction. In fact, we found evidence that release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol was concomitant with the decrease of GSH. These results are consistent with our previous data demonstrating that a diminution of intracellular GSH content, obtained either by chemical inhibition of its neosynthesis or by eliciting the extrusion of GSH, causes cytochrome crelease from mitochondria (31Ghibelli L. Coppola S. Fanelli C. Rotilio G. Civitareale A. Scovassi I. Ciriolo M.R. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2031-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, we previously demonstrated that cytochrome c release is a cellular response to lack of GSH, which can occur even in the absence of cell commitment to apoptosis; thus, cytochrome c release per se is not sufficient to trigger apoptosis, but other events have to occur as well (31Ghibelli L. Coppola S. Fanelli C. Rotilio G. Civitareale A. Scovassi I. Ciriolo M.R. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2031-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In our model, cytochrome c release is an early event that is followed by ROS production and proteolytic activation of caspase-9 and -3. The increased ROS production in cells deprived of GSH can be ascribed to an alteration of the redox equilibrium following the impairment of systems able to scavenge or detoxify the various reactive oxygen intermediates generated by normal cell metabolism. In summary, in this study we have outlined the mechanisms by which down-regulation of c-Myc commits melanoma cells to apoptosis. In particular, we have demonstrated that inhibition of the expression of c-myc causes deregulation of the biosynthesis of GSH and of the GSH/GSSG ratio. A decrease in GSH and consequent cytochromec release are early events in the apoptotic process, because they precede the surface exposure of phosphatidylserine. On the contrary, ROS production and activation of caspase-9 and -3, occurring later in the apoptotic process, appear as consequences of redox imbalance. On the basis of these results, γ-GCS and GSSG reductase appear to be possible therapeutic targets that can be modulated specifically to reestablish the apoptotic pathway in cancer cells. Moreover, because elevated levels of GSH have also been reported to play an important role in mediating tumor cell resistance to chemotherapy, the effect of down-regulation of c-Myc on GSH may contribute to increase drug susceptibility.

Proteoglycan forms of CD44 also exhibit affinity for fibronectin and collagen as well as chemokines and growth factors. CD44 plays a role in autoimmunity, inflammation, and tumor progression. Soluble CD44 (sCD44) is found in plasma, and the levels of sCD44 correlate with immune function and some malignancies. The mechanisms by which sCD44 is generated and its function are unknown. We demonstrate here that normal bronchial epithelial cells spontaneously release sCD44. Exposure to phagocyte- and bacterium-derived proteinases markedly increased the release of sCD44 from epithelial cells. The spontaneously released sCD44 was incorporated into high molecular mass complexes derived from the matrix that also contained chondroitin sulfate, fibronectin, hyaluronan, and collagens I and IV. Enzymatic digestion with proteinases liberated sCD44 from the high molecular mass complex. Consistent with the homology of CD44 to proteoglycan core and link proteins, these data suggest that CD44 spontaneously released from normal bronchial epithelial cells can accumulate as an integral component of the matrix, where it may play a role in the organization of matrices and in anchoring growth factors and chemokines to the matrix. Increases in plasma CD44 during immune activation and tumor progression therefore may be a manifestation of the matrix remodeling that occurs in the face of the enhanced proteolytic activity associated with infection, inflammation, and tumor metastasis, leading to alterations in cell-matrix interactions.

Cell-matrix interactions are critical for determination of cellular behavior. Some cells exhibit an extensive, highly organized pericellular matrix associated with the cell surface (1Knudson W. Aguiar D.J. Hua Q. Knudson C.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 228: 216-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; HA, hyaluronan; sCD44, soluble CD44; NBEC, normal bronchial epithelial cell(s); FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PE, phycoerythrin; SAMP, S. aureus metalloproteinase (aureolysin); PAMP, P. aeruginosa metalloproteinase (pseudolysin); mAb, monoclonal antibody; bPG, biotinylated bovine HA-binding protein; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; CatG, cathepsin G contains secreted molecules that are immobilized in the extracellular spaces and regulates the function of almost all cells. The interaction of cells with the matrix is mainly mediated by adhesion molecules. CD44 is a widely expressed family of adhesion receptors that range in molecular mass from 80 to 250 kDa and that represent alternatively spliced and post-translationally modified products of a single gene (2Schlossman S. Boumsell L. Gilks W. White Cell Differentiation Antigens. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar). The most common form, referred to as hematopoietic CD44, has an apparent molecular mass of 80–100 kDa and does not contain differentially spliced exons. CD44 isoforms expressing variant exons are mainly restricted to epithelia, activated lymphocytes, and tumor cells (3Droll A. Dougherty S.T. Chiu R.K. Dirks J.F. McBride W.H. Cooper D.L. Dougherty G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11567-11573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). CD44 is a major receptor for hyaluronan (HA), a glycosaminoglycan that is ubiquitously distributed in the ECM (4Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Meinich M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1301-1313Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2169) Google Scholar). In addition, proteoglycan forms of CD44 bind fibronectin (5Jalkanen S. Jalkanen M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), collagen (6Ehnis T. Dieterich W. Bauer M. Lampe B. Schuppan D. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), growth factors and cytokines (7Wolff E.A. Greenfield B. Taub D.D. Murphy W.J. Bennett K.L. Aruffo A. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). In normal tissues, CD44 appears to play a role in regulating the metabolism of hyaluronan. However, data have accumulated that indicate a prominent role for CD44 in different pathologic states, including autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases (9Mikecz K. Brennan F.R. Kim J.H. Glant T.T. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 10Estess P. DeGrendele H.C. Pascual V. Siegelman M.H. J. Clin.

J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1723-1733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Soluble CD44 (sCD44) is found in serum and lymph. Interestingly, immunodeficiency correlates with low plasma levels of sCD44, whereas malignant diseases, immune activation, and inflammation are often associated with increased plasma levels of CD44, indicating that immunological and malignant processes may promote the release of sCD44 (16Katoh S. McCarthy J.B. Kincade P.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3440-3449PubMed Google Scholar). However, the physiological inducers of CD44 release are unknown. The generation of sCD44 is believed to involve proteolytic cleavage of cell-surface CD44 (17Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Tsuiki H. Sasaki J. Nakao M. Matsumoto M. Suga M. Ando M. Nakajima M. Saya H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Potentially, all cells expressing CD44 are capable of releasing CD44. However, using cell lines stably transfected with different alternatively spliced isoforms of CD44, it has been demonstrated that release of CD44 variants is increased severalfold compared with that of hematopoietic CD44 (15Bartolazzi A. Jackson D. Bennett K. Aruffo A. Dickinson R. Shields J. Whittle N. Stamenkovic I. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1723-1733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in cells expressing variant forms of CD44, including epithelia, CD44 may be more vulnerable to proteolytic cleavage. The lung epithelium forms an important barrier between the external environment and the lung interstitium and is increasingly recognized as a participant in inflammatory processes both as a source of mediators and as a site of modulation of cell adhesion. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of release and characterized sCD44 from human lung-derived epithelial cells. Our results suggest that CD44 released from epithelial cells may accumulate as an integral component of the matrix, where it is physically associated with other ECM components, including fibronectin, HA, collagens I and IV, and chondroitin sulfate. Furthermore, bacterium- and phagocyte-derived proteases mediate the limited proteolysis and release of sCD44 from monolayers of normal bronchial epithelial cells (NBEC) into the fluid phase. Although previous studies have suggested a role for cell-surface CD44 in the assembly of hyaluronan-rich pericellular matrices, the function of sCD44 proteolytically cleaved from the cell surface is not known. Our results extend previous findings regarding cell-surface CD44 by demonstrating that CD44 released from cells can be incorporated as an integral component of cellular matrices and suggest a novel functional relationship between the release of sCD44 and tissue remodeling. The following anti-human CD44 monoclonal antibodies were used (2Schlossman S. Boumsell L. Gilks W. White Cell Differentiation Antigens.

The BCA kit was purchased from Pierce, and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. NBEC were obtained from Clonetics Corp. (San Diego, CA) or isolated as follows. Cells were removed by digestion with proteinase 14 from main stem or lobular bronchi from excess donor tissue obtained at the time of lung transplantation under the auspices of the University of North Carolina Institutional Committee on the Protection of the Rights of Human Subjects. Cells at passages 3–10 from five individuals were used in this study. Cells were cultured in serum-free bronchial epithelial cell basal medium (Clonetics Corp.) containing 0.5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 5 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 0.5 μg/ml epinephrine, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 0.5 ng/ml triiodothyronine, and 0.4% (v/v) bovine pituitary extract.

Each cycle included 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1.5 min at 72 °C. Thirty cycles were performed. Cells were incubated for 48 h in methionine-free medium containing 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (Tran35S-label) or in sulfate-free medium supplemented with 500 μCi/ml Na235SO4 (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.). Conditioned media were collected and centrifuged at 300 ×g for 10 min, followed by 600 × g for 15 min to remove cells and cellular debris. Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors (0.2 units/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Conditioned media and cell lysates were normalized based on protein concentration as determined by BCA assay, and equal amounts of protein were precleared with preimmune serum and then precipitated with Hermes III conjugated to Sepharose or with G44-26, followed by protein A/G Plus-agarose. Immune complexes were washed sequentially with high salt buffer (0.6 m NaCl, 125 mm KPO4 (pH 7.4), and 0.02% NaN3), mixed detergent buffer (0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.3 m NaCl, and 10 mm Tris (pH 8.6)), and phosphate-buffered saline; boiled in Laemmli sample buffer; resolved by SDS-8% PAGE under nonreducing conditions; and detected by fluorography. CD44 was immunoprecipitated with Sepharose-conjugated anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody (mAb) Hermes III. Immune complexes were resolved by SDS-8% PAGE under nonreducing or (where indicated) reducing conditions. CD44 was then visualized by ECL after electrotransfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubation with mouse anti-CD44 mAb (Hermes III or G44-26) and peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody. Cells were treated on tissue culture dishes with 0.1 unit/ml chondroitinase ABC and/or 20 units/ml hyaluronidase for 90 min. In all other instances, cell lysates were prepared as described above, and CD44 was immunoprecipitated with Sepharose-conjugated anti-CD44 mAb Hermes III. Treatment with chondroitinase ABC (2 units/ml) as well as keratanase (30 milliunits/ml) and heparinase III (5 units/ml) was performed on anti-CD44 immune complexes bound to Sepharose-conjugated Hermes III in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4 (chondroitinase ABC and keratanase) or in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.0 (heparinase III) for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested using 0.2% EDTA, stained with PE-conjugated mouse anti-human CD44 mAb G44-26 or PE-conjugated anti-human CD3 antibody, and analyzed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences). Soluble HA binding was assayed using saturating amounts of FITC-HA. Specific binding of FITC-HA to CD44 was determined using blocking anti-CD44 mAb 5F12. To determine the level of HA associated with the cell surface, NBEC were stained with biotinylated bovine HA-binding protein (bPG), followed by PE-conjugated streptavidin. Specificity was verified by pretreating the cells with 20 units/ml hyaluronidase at 37 °C for 2 h, followed by staining with bPG and PE-conjugated streptavidin. Confluent monolayers were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. After quenching endogenous peroxidase activity with 0.3% H2O2 and blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin, cells were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml bPG for 40 min at 4 °C. Controls for specificity of bPG binding included treatment with 20 units/ml hyaluronidase for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by incubation with bPG. Bound bPG was detected with avidin-biotin complex (VECTASTAIN ABC reagent, Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride in 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 0.01% H2O2 as substrate. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. The release of CD44 was quantified using a sandwich ELISA. Plates were coated with 2 μg/ml Hermes III in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.5) and 150 mm NaCl). The plates were then washed with 0.05% Tween 20, and nonspecific protein-binding sites were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin. Samples were added and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Affinity-purified CD44-immunoglobulin fusion protein (CD44-2-Rg) containing the complete extracellular domain of hematopoietic CD44 was used as a standard (4Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Meinich M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1301-1313Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2169) Google Scholar, 23Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. Amiot M. Seed B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Bound sCD44 was detected using FITC-conjugated anti-CD44 mAb G44-26 incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-FITC mAb and development withp-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. Soluble ICAM-1 was quantified using a soluble ICAM-1 ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). To detect matrix components physically associated with sCD44, conditioned media were incubated on streptavidin plates (Pierce) coated with biotinylated HA-binding protein or biotinylated anti-type I or anti-type IV collagen antibody to capture HA or collagen I or IV, respectively, or with biotinylated anti-CD3 antibody as a negative control. After washing, bound CD44 was detected by FITC-conjugated anti-CD44 mAb G44-26 as described above. To determine the HA content in cell lysates and conditioned media, we developed a modified ELISA based on competitive binding of endogenous HA and FITC-labeled exogenous HA to microwell-bound bPG. Cells were incubated in culture media without bovine pituitary extract for 48 h. Cell lysates and conditioned media were then collected and incubated at room temperature for 30 min to capture endogenous HA. Unlabeled purified HA from human umbilical cords was used as a standard. Unsaturated bPG sites were detected by incubation with FITC-HA at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-FITC mAb and p-nitrophenyl phosphate. CD44 and HA are both expressed on the surface of the bronchial epithelium (24Green S.J. Tarone G. Underhill C.B. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 89: 145-156Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis and functional significance of this potential CD44-HA interaction have not been elucidated. We characterized CD44 in cultured primary NBEC. NBEC were found to express CD44 on the cell surface (Fig.1 A, left panel) and to synthesize HA (Fig. 1 B). The HA appeared to be at least partially cell-associated (Fig. 1, A, right panel; and B). ELISA analysis of HA levels in lysates and conditioned media of NBEC incubated for 48 h demonstrated ∼2-fold higher levels of cell-associated HA than HA released into the conditioned media (1.93 versus 1 μg/1 × 106 cells). These data indicate that a majority of the HA that is synthesized at the cell surface is retained on the cell surface, possibly as a part of the pericellular matrix. Similar to most other primary cells studied, CD44 expressed on NBEC did not constitutively exhibit affinity for exogenous HA (Fig. 1 A,middle panel). These data might indicate that the receptor was occupied by endogenous ligand. However, pretreatment of NBEC with hyaluronidase to degrade endogenous HA only slightly increased the capacity of cells to bind exogenous HA (data not shown). Using exon-specific reverse transcription-PCR analysis, we found that NBEC transcribed all known CD44 exons (Fig.2). A predominant band indicating the presence of full-length transcripts expressing all intervening exons was detected with the C13/HS3′ primer set flanking the site of insertion of variant exons on the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. Several other bands indicating the presence of shorter alternatively spliced transcripts were also detected, but at significantly lower abundance with the same primer set. To examine the expression of CD44 at the protein level, we used mAb G44-26, which recognizes all forms of CD44 (2Schlossman S. Boumsell L. Gilks W. White Cell Differentiation Antigens. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar). Three major species of CD44 with average molecular masses of 90, 150, and 180 kDa were identified in lysates of [35S]methionine-labeled NBEC by immunoprecipitation. A higher molecular mass species of >210 kDa that exhibited extensive microheterogeneity was also evident (Fig.2 C). A similar profile of species was detected under nonreducing conditions by immunoprecipitation with Hermes III and then detection by immunoblotting with Hermes III (Fig. 2 D) or mAb G44-26 (data not shown). Four major species of CD44 were also identified in CD44 immunoprecipitates subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, although in this case, the higher molecular mass species of >210 kDa appeared to be less intense (Fig. 2 D). The similar patterns obtained under reducing and nonreducing conditions suggest that the majority of the high molecular mass species containing CD44 are not the result of formation of disulfite-linked complexes. A band with average molecular mass of 50 kDa represents IgG heavy chains released from IgG-Sepharose conjugates as a result of boiling in the presence of reducing agent. CD44 can be modified by attachment of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (25Greenfield B. Wang W.C. Marquardt H. Piepkorn M. Wolff E.A. Aruffo A. Bennett K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2511-2517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To detect CD44-associated sulfated GAGs, CD44 was immunoprecipitated from lysates of [35S]sulfate-labeled NBEC. Only the high molecular mass species with an average molecular mass of >210 kDa were sulfated (Fig. 2 E, left lane). To characterize the target of sulfation, CD44 was digested with enzymes that cleave specific GAGs. Heparinase III or keratanase had no effect on the sulfated species of CD44 (Fig. 2 E). In contrast, chondroitinase ABC digestion resulted in the degradation of the vast majority of the CD44-associated sulfated GAGs, indicating that the sulfated entity mainly represents chondroitin sulfate chains that are either covalently attached or otherwise tightly physically associated with CD44 in a high molecular mass complex. Elevated proteolytic activity related to infection and inflammation is associated with lung epithelial cell dysfunction. We examined the effect of pathogen- and phagocyte-derived proteinases on the release of sCD44 from NBEC. Neutrophil serine proteinases, including elastase and cathepsin G (CatG), have been identified in purulent bronchial secretions. On the other hand, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, which can colonize airways in patients with a variety of chronic lung conditions, secrete metalloproteinases, including aureolysin (SAMP) and pseudolysin (PAMP) (26Stockley R.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 150: S109-S113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Suter S. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 150: S118-S122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Low levels of sCD44 were detected in the conditioned media of control cells at 90 min (Fig.3 A) and continued to accumulate in the conditioned media of control cells progressively over a 48-h culture period. However, treatment of NBEC with CatG, SAMP, and PAMP resulted in a marked increase in the release of sCD44 (Fig.3 A). Enzyme-induced release of CD44 was time- and dose-dependent, reaching a maximum with 2 μg/ml proteinases at 90 min. Neutrophil elastase at 2 μg/ml also induced the release of sCD44, but less efficiently compared with CatG (data not shown). Neither CatG nor PAMP induced release of ICAM-1 (Fig.3 B), suggesting that sCD44 is selectively released under these conditions. The SAMP- and PAMP-induced generation of sCD44 was completely blocked by the metalloproteinase inhibitor 1,10-phenanthroline, whereas CatG-induced release was inhibited by a specific inhibitor of CatG, α1-antichymotrypsin, and by an inhibitor of chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like proteinases, aprotinin (Fig. 3 A), thus confirming that enzymatic activity is required for the protease-induced release of sCD44. Because CD44 has been implicated in the growth and metastasis of epithelium-derived tumors, we also examined the capacity of lung-derived tumor cell lines to release CD44. CatG and SAMP had a significant effect on CD44 release in HTB55 human adenocarcinoma cells, but did not induce the generation of sCD44 in HTB58 human squamous carcinoma cells. Interestingly, enzyme-induced release of sCD44 appeared to correlate with the expression of variant forms of CD44 in the epithelial cell lines (Fig. 4) (28Cichy J. Puré E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18061-18069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Epithelial cells express a proteoglycan form of CD44 decorated with chondroitin sulfate as well as isoforms of CD44 that are not associated with sulfated GAGs as demonstrated above. To investigate whether the association of CD44 with chondroitin sulfate affected susceptibility of the receptor to proteolysis, NBEC were treated with chondroitinase ABC. Surprisingly, treatment with chondroitinase alone resulted in release of sCD44 from NBEC (Fig. 3 A). The effect of chondroitinase was not inhibited by the metalloproteinase inhibitor 1,10phenanthroline or by the chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like proteinase inhibitor aprotinin, indicating the specificity of the chondroitinase activity (Fig. 3 A). Treatment with hyaluronidase did not induce the release of sCD44, but enhanced the release of sCD44 in combination with chondroitinase (Fig.3 C). These results suggest that in addition to cleavage of cell-surface CD44, sCD44 may be generated as the result of dissociation of a reservoir of sCD44 that accumulates as a component of the cell-associated matrix. We also tested whether inhibition of proteoglycan synthesis altered the susceptibility of CD44 to release by chondroitinase. NBEC were grown in the presence of β-d-xyloside, which acts as a primer of free GAG chains, diverting assembly of the chains from the core proteins and causing secretion of free GAGs from cells. Incubation of NBEC with β-d-xyloside resulted in an average 85% reduction of the sulfation of CD44, indicating extensive but not complete loss of chondroitin sulfate chains from CD44 (data not shown). As expected, the release of CD44 by chondroitinase from β-d-xyloside-treated NBEC cells was reduced compared with control cells. Treatment with β-d-xyloside also compromised CatG-induced release of CD44, but did not inhibit the capacity of SAMP- or PAMP-treated NBEC to generate sCD44 (Fig.3 A). In contrast to SAMP or PAMP, CatG is a strongly cationic protein (19Potempa J. Travis J. Handbook on Proteinases. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1998: 1540-1542Google Scholar, 20Kessler E. Ohman D.E. Handbook on Proteinases. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1998: 1058-1064Google Scholar, 29Salvesen G.S. Handbook on Proteinases. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1998: 60-62Google Scholar). Therefore, cationic sites on CatG might be important in the initial interaction with negatively charged chondroitin sulfate on the surface of epithelial cells, targeting CatG to a specific substrate and amplifying the effect of this enzyme on release of CD44. In any case, these results suggest that CD44 is subject to proteinase-mediated release to varying degrees depending on whether the receptor is or is not associated with proteoglycans. Immunoprecipitation of CD44 from lysates of [35S] methionine-labeled cells treated with CatG, SAMP, PAMP, and chondroitinase revealed that high molecular mass species of >210 kDa were mainly targeted by the enzymes (Fig.5 A), consistent with the evidence that the"

The first event in this control is production of large amounts of a regulatory nucleotide, guanosine-3′,5′-(bis)pyrophospahte (ppGpp). It was proposed recently that ppGpp acts by decreasing stability of open complexes at promoters that make short-lived open complexes,e.g. the rRNA promoters. However, here we report that the bacteriophage λp R promoter, which forms long-lived open complexes, is inhibited by ppGpp in vitroas observed in vivo. We performed a systematic investigation of the ppGpp-specific inhibition of transcription initiation at λp R and found that ppGpp does decrease stability of open complexes at λp R, but only slightly. Likewise the equilbrium binding constant and rate of open complex formation by RNA polymerase at λp R are only slightly affected by ppGpp. The major effect of ppGpp-mediated inhibition is to decrease the rate of promoter escape. We conclude that ppGpp-mediated inhibition of transcription initiation is not restricted to promoters that make short-lived open complexes. Rather we conclude that the initial catalytic step of transcript formation is affected by ppGpp, specifically formation of the first phosphodiester bond is inhibited by ppGpp at λp R.

Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, ppGpp synthesis may be catalyzed by two enzymes: RelA and SpoT. The relA gene product, ppGpp synthetase I, is a ribosome-associated enzyme activated upon amino acid starvation due to disruption of the translation process via interaction of uncharged tRNAs with “hungry” codons at the ribosomal A site. The spoT gene product, ppGpp synthetase II, is responsible for ppGpp synthesis in a ribosome-independent manner during carbon source or energy limitation (4Hernandez V.J. Bremer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5991-5999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Xiao H. Kalman M. Ikehara K. Zemel S. Glaser G. Cashel M. J. Biol.

J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 41-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). SpoT is a bifunctional protein capable of both ppGpp synthesis and hydrolysis and is the only major intracellular ppGpp degradase. Knock-out mutants in the relA gene do not contain functional ppGpp synthetase I, and do not produce ppGpp during amino acid starvation due to the fact that ppGpp synthetase II is inactive under these conditions (7Murray K.D. Bremer H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 41-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This leads to a decrease in ppGpp level following amino acid-starvation ofrelA cells, such a phenotype is called the “relaxed” response. Although inhibition of synthesis of stable RNAs during the stringent response is very effective, the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. Travers (8Travers A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 2605-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) suggested that the nucleotide sequence located between the −10 consensus hexamer and +1 nucleotide position, which he termed the “discriminator,” determines sensitivity of a promoter to ppGpp. He proposed that during the stringent response, promoters with a GC-rich discriminator are negatively regulated, while those with AT-rich discriminators were positively regulated. However, extensive mutational analyses revealed that the sequence identity of this region is not sufficient to explain the regulatory response of a promoter during the stringent response (for a review, see Ref. 1Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Neidhard F.C. Curtiss R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E.

However, assuming that this is the sole effect of ppGpp on transcription it would be hard to explain why some promoters display differential sensitivity to ppGpp with some being highly sensitive and others being relatively insensitive. Recently, Barkeret al. (12Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) demonstrated that ppGpp decreased the stability of open complexes at all promoters they investigated. Open complexes at the major promoters located upstream of genes coding for rRNAs,rrn P1 promoters, are extremely unstable. It was proposed that ppGpp inhibits transcription preferentially from these promoters by further destabilizing these intrinsically unstable open complexes and, furthermore, that ppGpp-mediated transcription inhibition is generalized to affect all similarly behaving promoters. The hypothesis described above could explain differences between various promoters in their sensitivities to ppGpp. Namely, the open complex stability of a specific promoter may dictate its sensitivity to ppGpp with promoters forming stable open promoter complexes displaying resisitance to ppGpp. Contrary to this hypothesis, a ppGpp-dependent inhibition of the λp R promoter in vivo was shown (13Szalewska-Palasz A. Wegrzyn A. Herman A. Wegrzyn G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5779-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Szalewska-Palasz A. Wegrzyn G. Acta Biochim.

Virology. 1999; 262: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), while λp R has been demonstrated to form very stable open complexes in vitro (17McKane M. Gussin G.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our principle aim in the these studies was to elucidate the mechanism of λp R promoter inhibition by ppGpp to: 1) extend the current general mechanistic picture of ppGpp-mediated transcription inhibition and 2) to verify our previous in vivo observations with respect to ppGpp inhibition at λp R, in vitro. Toward these goals we first sought to establish in vitro conditions that would reproduce the level of transcription inhibition of the λp R promoter by ppGpp observed in vivo. Once optimization of in vitro conditions for ppGpp inhibition of λp R were established, we proceeded to investigate the specific mechanism of ppGpp inhibition at λp R. The λp R promoter region (−75 to +35 bp) was generated by PCR using wild-type λ DNA as template and the following primers λpR3 (5′-CCCGGGTTAAGCGTTGTTCCA) and λpR4 (5′-CGAATTCACCGCAGGGATAAA-3′). Following digestion withEcoRI and SmaI, the DNA fragment was then cloned into pHG86 (18Giladi H. Igarashi K. Ishihama A. Oppenheim A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), previously cut with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid, called pKP-70pR, served as the template in the PCR reactions where primers pR4 and pUC1 (5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′; pUC19 universal primer) were used. The 268-bp PCR fragment thus obtained was used in the in vitro transcription reactions (the full-length fragment produced in such reactions was 198 nucleotides long). The λpL promoter-containing region was generated by PCR using wild-type λ DNA as the template and the following primers: pL1, 5′-GAATTCCCATACATTAGTGAGTTGA-3′ and pL2, 5′-GGATTCTGATTGCTGCCTTGA-3′. The resulting fragment used in thein vitro transcription experiments was 1205 bp long, and the transcript initiating from the λpL promoter was 660 nucleotides long. Deoxynucleotides used in the PCR reactions as well as the restriction enzymes were purchased from MBI Fermentas. Taq polymerase was obtained fromFINNZYMES, T4 DNA ligase from Invitrogen, andE. coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme (RNAP) from EpiCentre Technologies. Nucleotides used in in vitro transcription experiments were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. ppGpp was a generous gift of Dr. Mike Cashel (National Institutes of Health). ApU, used in the abortive initiation transcriptions, and [α-32P]UTP were purchased from ICN Biomedicals. In vitrotranscription assays were performed using 20 nmλpR template and 60–140 nm RNAPs indicated in the following transcription buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 140 mm KCl (unless indicated otherwise), 100 μmATP, GTP, and CTP, and 10 μm UTP (10 μCi/reaction [α-32P]UTP) and either 250 μm GDP or 250 μm ppGpp. The final reaction volume was 20 μl. RNA polymerase was preincubated with GDP or ppGpp for 7 min at room temperature prior to mixing with KCl, followed by 2-min incubation at 37 °C, and reactions were started by mixing RNAP with λ promoter templates and NTP substrates at 37 °C. Transcription was terminated after 10 min by addition of 100 μl of stop solution (30 mm EDTA, 300 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5), 1 mg/ml glycogen) and followed by precipitation with 370 μl of ice-cold absolute ethanol for 1 h at −20 °C. Precipitates were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 μl of formamide loading buffer (66% formamide, 1 mmEDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 1× Tris borate-EDTA buffer). 10 μl of RNA re-suspensions were resolved on 7 m urea, 6% polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide to bis ratio 19:1). Gels were visualized and quantified by phosphorimaging on a Bio-Rad Molecular Imaging system. RNAP (60 nm) and DNA template (20 nm) were incubated for 7 min at room temperature in transcription buffer with 250 μm GDP or 250 μm ppGpp, followed by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C with 140 mm KCl. After heparin (100 μg/ml final) addition, aliquots (10 μl) were removed to a tube containing 10 μl of an NTPs mix (final concentrations: 100 μm ATP, GTP, and CTP, 10 μm UTP (10 μCi/reaction [α-32P]UTP), and 100 μg/ml heparin) in transcription buffer, at the indicated times. Reactions were chased out, stopped after 7 min, and analyzed as described above. Determination of KB and kf—K B and k fwere determined by τ plots analysis, as described previously (17McKane M. Gussin G.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar,19Goodrich J.A. McClure W.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). DNA (1 nm) and RNAP (7.5–90 nm) were combined in transcription buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 140 mm KCl, 500 μm ApU, 50 μm GTP, 5 μm UTP (15 μCi of [α-32P]UTP), and 250 μm GDP or 250 μm ppGpp. Prior to mixing, RNAP was preincubated with GDP or ppGpp for 7 min at room temperature in a transcription buffer without KCl. At indicated times (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 min), 5-μl aliquots were removed and added to 5 μl of stop solution (7 m urea, 0.1m EDTA, 0.4% SDS, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.5% (w/v) xylene cyanol) to terminate the reaction. The control reactions were started with the addition of NTPs to the tube containing RNAP prebound to DNA. Reactions were analyzed on 7 m urea, 20% polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide to bis ratio 59:1), with 0.5 × TBE top buffer and 1.2 × TBE bottom buffer. The amount of product (ApUpGpU) was quantitated by phosphorimaging on a Bio-Rad Molecular Imaging system. To determine τobs (lag time observed) for each RNAP concentration, a best fit line was determined through the experimental curve parallel to the control curve (control curve reflected the rates of abortive initiation in control reactions initiated with nucleotides) (20McClure W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5634-5638Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To determine KB and kf, SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific) was used to perform a least square fit of the data to Equation 1 (20McClure W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5634-5638Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), τobs=1/kf+1/KBkf[RNAP](Eq. 1) where τobs is the lag time observed,k f is the isomerization constant,K B is the binding constant of the RNAP to the promoter, and [RNAP] is the RNA polymerase concentration. RNAP (60 nm) was incubated with 20 nm DNA template and 250 μmGDP or 250 μm ppGpp at room temperature for 7 min in the transcription buffer, followed by the addition of KCl to 140 mm and incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. RNA sythesis was started by addition of NTPs (final concentrations: 100 μmATP, GTP, and CTP and 10 μm UTP (10 μCi/reaction [α-32P]UTP)) and heparin (100 μg/ml). 20-μl aliquots were removed at the indicated times, and the reactions were stopped and analyzed as described above. RNA products were resolved on a 7 m urea, 6% polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide to bis ratio 19:1) or, to visualize the abortive transcription products, on a 7 m urea, 25% polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide to bis ratio 12:1). RNAP (60 nm) was incubated with 250 μm GDP or 250 μm ppGpp in the transcription buffer for 7 min at room temperature followed by addition of KCl to 140 mm. Next, RNAP was added to NTP substrates (final concentrations: 250 μm UTP, 250 μm CTP, 20 μm GTP (10 μCi/reaction [α-32P]GTP), 15 μm ATP, and 0–500 μm ApU initiator) and λpR template (20 nm) to initiate the reaction. After 10-min incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped and analyzed as described above. Using Northern blot analysis and analysis of activity of a gene fusion consisting of the lacZ gene under control of the λp R promoter, it was previously demonstrated that the bacteriophage λp R promoter activity is significantly decreased during the stringent, but not relaxed, response of E. coli (13Szalewska-Palasz A. Wegrzyn A. Herman A. Wegrzyn G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5779-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Szalewska-Palasz A. Wegrzyn G. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1995; 42: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 16Slominska M. Neubauer P. Wegrzyn G. Virology. 1999; 262: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Genetic studies strongly suggested that this inhibition is due to direct rather than indirect effects of ppGpp on the reporter gene expression (15Wrobel B. Murphy H. Cashel M. Wegrzyn G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies revealed 5–10 times less λp R-initiated transcripts in amino acid-starved wild-type bacteria relative to normal growth conditions. Decreased levels of transcripts derived from the λp R promoter could not be explained by lower rates of transcription elongation (according to the model proposed by Vogel and Jensen (10Vogel U. Jensen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18335-18340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Vogel U. Jensen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16236-16241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), since replacement of λp R with the p lacpromoter, known to be independent of ppGpp, in the constructs used for measurement of transcription efficiency resulted in complete restoration of transcript abundance during the stringent response to levels comparable with those observed under normal growth conditions (13Szalewska-Palasz A. Wegrzyn A. Herman A. Wegrzyn G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5779-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Despite these many observations implicating ppGpp-dependent inhibition of λp R, direct evidence of ppGpp inhibition of λp R has been lacking. Thus, we initiated in vitro transcription assays, first to verify, then to investigate, ppGpp-mediated inhibition of λp R. We initiated these investigations by accessing the effect of ppGpp on in vitro transcription of λp R at different KCl concentrations based on previous observations that the ppGpp-specific transcription inhibitory effects are profoundly salt-sensitive (12Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 21Ohlsen K.L. Gralla J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 16: 2243-2251Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We found that levels of transcripts derived from a λp R promoter template in multiple-round in vitro transcription assays were severalfold (5-fold on average) lower in the presence of ppGpp than in control experiments in which GDP was used at the same concentrations as control (Fig. 1). The degree of ppGpp-mediated inhibition of λp R was observed to be highly salt-dependent, as has been previously reported for the rrnB P1 promoter (12Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 21Ohlsen K.L. Gralla J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 16: 2243-2251Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The greatest degree of inhibition was observed between 140 and 160 mm KCl (Fig. 1). In all further experiments we used KCl at a final concentration of 140 mm. In addition, we found that to observe ppGpp inhibition of λp R, ppGpp had to be preincubated with RNAP prior to addition of KCl; thus, apparently, the initial interaction of ppGpp itself with RNAP is salt-sensitive (data not shown). The ppGpp-mediated inhibition of λp R was promoter-specific as the λp L promoter appeared to be insensitive to ppGpp under the same experimental conditions (Figs. 1 and2). These results are in good agreement with both in vivo (16Slominska M. Neubauer P. Wegrzyn G. Virology. 1999; 262: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and in vitro (12Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) studies that demonstrated that λp L is not inhibited by ppGpp. Moreover, since these results indicate no significant influence of ppGpp on the amounts of p L-derived transcripts, the decreased levels of p R-derived transcripts cannot be trivially ascribed to lower rates of transcription elongation but are promoter-specific. The level of inhibition of the p R promoter was dose-dependent on ppGpp concentration, but above a concentration of 200 μm the efficacy of ppGpp-dependent inhibition was roughly constant (Fig. 2). In all further studies a saturating level of 250 μm ppGpp or GDP (in control experiments) was used. The degree of inhibition we observed in vitro (about 5-fold) was in a good correlation with in vivo measurements that indicated 5–10-fold decreased levels of p R-derived transcripts under conditions of increased ppGpp levels in vivo (13Szalewska-Palasz A. Wegrzyn A. Herman A. Wegrzyn G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5779-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 15Wrobel B. Murphy H. Cashel M. Wegrzyn G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Hence, we conclude that inhibition of transcription from thep R promoter by ppGpp is direct. Next, we focused on elucidation of the specific influence of ppGpp on specific steps of the transcription initiation process at λp R. Barker et al. (12Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) reported that ppGpp decreases stability of open complexes on all promoters tested; however, only in the case of promoters, which form intrinsically short-lived open complexes, the observed ppGpp-dependent destabilization of open complexes resulted in inhibition of promoter activity. Based on our observations of ppGpp-specific p R promoter inhibition (Figs. 1and 2) we also investigated effects of ppGpp on the stability of open complexes formed at p R. RNA polymerase-promoter complexes were preformed on DNA templates in the presence of RNAP pretreated with either GDP (control experiments) or ppGpp. This was followed by addition of heparin (to prevent re-association of RNA polymerase) and subsequent chase with nucleotides (NTPs) at different times to determine the relative fraction of complexes remaining by quantifying levels of p R-specific transcripts. In agreement with the observations of Barker et al. (12Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), we found that ppGpp decreased stability of open complexes formed at p R about 2-fold (Fig.3). In GDP control experiments we confirmed the previous observations (17McKane M. Gussin G.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) that p Rmakes long-lived open complexes (Fig. 3). We estimated the average lifetime of open complexes at p R to be ∼1 h compared with half-lives of less than a minute for rrnB andrrnD P1 open complexes (12Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The 2-fold destabilization of RNAP·p R open complexes in the presence of ppGpp, however, appears not to account for the observed 5-fold decrease in the activity of the p R promoter. Since the stability of open complexes formed at λp R is not dramatically affected in the presence of ppGpp, at least not to a level which can explain the full level of inhibition observed (Figs. 1 and 2), we next determined the apparent equilibrium binding constant of RNAP (KB) and the rate constant of open complex formation (kf) atp R in the presence of either GDP (control experiments) or ppGpp. This was accomplished by performing τ plot analyses using in vitro abortive transcription assays based on the classical method described by McClure (20McClure W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5634-5638Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The results presented in Fig. 4 and TableI indicate that ppGpp has only a slight effect on either KB and kf at thep R promoter. Therefore, changes in either of these parameters appears not to be responsible for the observed decrease in transcription efficiency from p R by ppGpp.Table ISummary of kinetic constants for the λpR promoter in the presence of GDP or ppGppNucleotideτobsk fK BK B k fs10−2 s−1106m−1104m−1s−1GDP22.6 ± 4.834.42 ± 0.6430.26 ± 5.18135.85 ± 22.09ppGpp16.6 ± 2.056.02 ± 0.3824.59 ± 7.01148.06 ± 9.36Values for τobs, k f, andK B k f were calculated from τ plots (Fig. 4) as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” S.E. values were determined from residuals of the least square fit to Equation 1.

Next we sought to investigate possible effects of ppGpp on pR promoter clearance also termed “promoter escape.” Following formation of RNAP-λpR binary complexes, single-round transcription assays were performed by the simultaneous addition of heparin and NTP substrates. The rate of accumulation of full-length products was determined with increasing time in the presence or absence of ppGpp (Fig. 5). In the presence of ppGpp there was observed a significant lag in formation of full-length transcripts compared with the GDP control (approximately a 4-fold difference; lasting 30 s in the presence of GDP and 2 min in the presence of ppGpp (see inset Fig. 5). Therefore, escape of the RNAP from the pR promoter is impaired in the presence of ppGpp. Surprisingly, we did not observe changes in the amounts of abortive transcripts accumulating under these conditions (data not shown). In addition, this observed lag in promoter clearance at λpR is sufficient to account for the observed 5-fold inhibition (80% inhibition) observed in multiple-round transcription assays (Figs. 1 and 2). Specifically, over the duration of a 10-min multiple round assay with a respective clearance time of 30 s or 2 min in the presence of GDP or ppGpp, respectively, 20 versus5 rounds of transcription would occur leading to an apparent observed 75% inhibition. The results of the promoter clearance assay (Fig. 5) was in conflict with observations that there was little or no observable alteration in the apparent rate of open complex formation determined by the McClure abortive transcription assay method (Fig. 4). In the experiments presented in Fig. 4, determination of apparent kinetic constants, KB and kf, relied on measurement of the rate of formation of the initial transcribed tetramer RNA species from λpR, ApUpGpU (see “Experimental Procedures”). However, no ppGpp-induced effect was observed in the kinetics of formation of this small RNA, which would have led to an overestimation of the rate of open complex formation, and apparent erroneous indication of a ppGpp-dependent effect on the rate of open complex formation, which it did not (Fig. 4; Table I). Despite this, a ppGpp-induced slower rate of promoter escape was indeed evident (Fig.5). Thus, we hypothesized that the lower rate of promoter escape is not evident during early steps in the RNA polymerization process either 1) because the slow step in promoter escape occurs after the RNAP has advanced past the stage of formation of the tetramer RNA or 2) that the use of a dinucleotide in the McClure abortive assay method (see “Experimental Procedures”) to produce the tetramer RNA caused the initial transcription process to be resistant to the presence of ppGpp. To test the latter of these possibilities we investigated whether programming transcription initiation with the initiating dinucleotide (corresponding to +1 and +2 positions), ApU, would have an effect on ppGpp-dependent inhibition of λpR. For these experiments, we used a low concentration of ATP (15 μm), which was not limiting for elongation (data not shown) but reduced competition for initiation by ApU, and increasing concentrations of ApU initiator, from 0 to 500 μm in the presence or absence of ppGpp. Results shown in Fig. 6demonstrate that as initiation is increasingly driven by the dinucleotide ApU, transcription from λpR becomes completely resistant to the inhibitory effects of ppGpp. That is, at 0 concentration of ApU when initiation is being driven solely by ATP, the 80% ppGpp inhibitory effect is evident (compared with the GDP control), but at increased concentrations of ApU when initiation is increasingly driven by the dinucleotide initiator, less difference in the level of transcript accumulation is observed, and ppGpp inhibition is progressively diminished and is no longer apparent at a concentration above 50 μm ApU (Fig. 6). This effect is specific for the dinucleotide initiator, since increasing the concentration of the initiating nucleotide ATP from 0 to 500 μm, using a nonspecific dinucleotide (ApC) or using a dinucleotide corresponding to the −1 and +1 positions (CpA), still displayed ppGpp-specific inhibition (data not shown). ppGpp is a stress-induced small molecular weight effector of RNAP being produced in large amounts in response to a variety of environmental stresses, for example, the onset of amino acid starvation in bacterial cells (for a review, see Ref. 1Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Neidhard F.C. Curtiss R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar). The production of ppGpp leads directly to global changes in bacterial physiology, called the stringent response. ppGpp binds directly and allosterically to RNA polymerase (2Chatterji D. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 3Toulokhonov I.I. Shulgina I. Hernandez V.J. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 1995; 15: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), resulting in direct transcriptional inhibition of those promoters responsible for synthesis of stable ribosomal and transfer RNAs. However, it is intriguing that the modification of RNA polymerase by ppGpp results in inhibition of transcription from some promoters, whereas other promoters are insensitive to this nucleotide or even stimulated during the stringent response (see Ref. 1Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Neidhard F.C. Curtiss R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar for review). The most extensively investigated promoters under negative ppGpp regulation are the major rRNA promoters, designated the rrnP1 promoters. Recently it was proposed that ppGpp decreases stability of open complexes at all promoters but inhibits transcription directly only from promoters that form intrinsically short-lived open complexes, as is exemplified by the rrnB and rrnD P1 promoters (12Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of ppGpp on transcription from these promoters appears to be primarily through the destabilization of the RNAP·rrn P1 binary open complexes which are intrinsically short lived. The mechanism of ppGpp-mediated inhibition of promoters forming relatively stable open complexes, however, remained obscure. In fact, previous in vivo data (13Szalewska-Palasz A. Wegrzyn A. Herman A. Wegrzyn G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5779-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Szalewska-Palasz A. Wegrzyn G. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1995; 42: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 15Wrobel B. Murphy H. Cashel M. Wegrzyn G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 16Slominska M. Neubauer P. Wegrzyn G. Virology. 1999; 262: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) indicated that the bacteriophage λp R, shown to form long-lived open complexes in vitro (17McKane M. Gussin G.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), is also inhibited by ppGpp. Here, using in vitro transcription assays we confirmed previous in vivo results that ppGpp inhibits transcription from the λp R promoter directly (Figs. 1 and2). We then further investigated the specific ppGpp-dependant mechanism of λp R inhibition. We found that ppGpp decreases stability of open complexes at λp Rabout 2-fold (Fig. 3), but since overall inhibition was ∼80% (Fig.2), this 2-fold destabilization cannot account solely for the observed ppGpp-mediated inhibition of λp R. In addition, neither the equilibrium binding constant, K B, nor the rate constant of open complex formation, kf, at λp R were significantly influenced by ppGpp (Fig. 4, Table I). In fact, we found that a decrease in the rate of promoter escape of RNAP from λp R in the presence of ppGpp (Fig. 5) can nearly account for the full inhibition by ppGpp observed on λp R (75% inhibition). However, it seems that ppGpp can affect several steps in the transcription process each to varying degrees. Thus, it is likely that the cumulative effects of inhibition at perhaps each of these steps is what ultimately leads to the total 80% inhibitory effect of ppGpp on λp R. Our results clearly indicate that ppGpp-mediated inhibition of transcription initiation is not restricted to promoters that make short-lived open complexes, as proposed by Barker et al.(12Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Clearly, the general mechanism of ppGpp inhibitory action is more complicated than solely decreasing the stability of open complexes. On the other hand, it is likely that the 2–3-fold ppGpp-mediated decrease in half-lives of open complexes formed at rrn P1 promoters, which are unstable even under normal conditions, is sufficient to account for the inhibition observed at these promoters (12Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Therefore, the model of ppGpp-mediated regulation of transcription initiation proposed by Barker et al. (12Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), while it appears to be valid for rrn promoters, is insufficient to explain the mechanism of ppGpp inhibition of activities of promoters exemplified in this report by λp R. Unexpectedly, we found that when “programming” transcription initiation from the natural λp R start site using the dinucleotide initiator, corresponding to +1 and +2 positions (ApU), the ppGpp-mediated inhibition of λp Rwas abrogated (Fig. 6). Our testing of this possibility was an attempt to reconcile differences observed in the transcription of abortive RNA during τ plot analyses (Fig. 4) and of the observed effect on the rate of promoter escape (Fig. 5), found in the presence of ppGpp. In the former assay, RNA synthesis was performed using the dinucleotide initiator ApU, while in the latter, initiation was via the normal mode of RNA synthesis. The ppGpp inhibitory effect being evident in the latter case but not the former, we elected to access the impact of the dinucleotide initiator on ppGpp action. The simplest interpretation of this result, as well as previous results presented here, is that ppGpp-mediated inhibition at λp Rprimarily slows the formation of the first phosphodiester bond, leading to a low rate of initial transcription resulting ultimately in a low overall rate of promoter escape. When transcription is initiated with the ApU dinucleotide, but not with CpA (corresponding to −1 and +1 positions), the slow step in initial transcription caused by ppGpp is effectively “by-passed” and leads to apparent resistance of λp R to ppGpp inhibitory effects. Likewise, no effect was observed when a nonspecific dinucleotide, ApC, was used. This new finding regarding the mode of action of ppGpp likely has implications for the regulation of other ppGpp regulated promoters like the rrn P1 promoters. It has been previously noted that intrinsically unstable rrnB P1 promoter open complexes as discussed above can be stabilized by the addition of the initiating +1 and +2 nucleotides, ATP and CTP, due apparently to dinucleotide formation (23Gourse R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9789-9809Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the presence of the initiating dinucleotide can stabilize the binary complex of RNAP and therrnB P1 promoter, and it is the intrinsic instability of therrnB P1 open complex that is the kinetic target of ppGpp action (12Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Given these facts and our current observations, it is tempting to speculate that the dinucleotide initiator of therrnB P1, ApC, would likewise stabilize the rrnBP1 open complex and lead to ppGpp resistance as was observed here for λp R. If this were true, it would cast the ppGpp inhibition of the rrnB P1 promoter in vivoin a new light, since it is difficult to envision how ppGpp would lead to inhibition of rrn promoters in vivo due to high intracellular concentrations of ATP and CTP in cells that remain well over the K m for binding to RNAP under all conditions of growth (24Petersen C. Moller L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3931-3935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and thus should allow formation of dinucleotides at RNAP·rrn promoter complexes and thus stabilization of rrn open complexes. If, however, the primary effect of ppGpp were to slow the formation of the dinucleotide by kinetically inhibiting or slowing the formation of the first phosphodiester bond, this could in turn slow formation of a stable RNAP·rrnB P1 binary complex in vivo resulting in accumulation of closed promoter complexes and rapid RNAP promoter dissociation. Currently studies of ppGpp inhibition on therrnB P1 promoter in the presence of initiating dinucleotide are ongoing and will be reported elsewhere. Bacteriophage λ, as a temperate virus, after infection ofE. coli must make a decision whether to lyse the host cell or to form a lysogen (for recent reviews, see Refs. 25Taylor K. Wegrzyn G. Busby S.J.W. Thomas C.M. Brown N.L. Molecular Microbiology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998: 81-97Crossref Google Scholar and 26Wegrzyn G. Wegrzyn A. Baranska S. Czyz A. Recent Res. Dev. Virol. 2001; 3: 375-386Google Scholar). This is a crucial decision for the phage, which should ensure its effective propagation in bacteria growing under different conditions. Nutrition conditions are among the most important factors influencing the lysis versus lysogenization decision of λ phage. Since ppGpp synthesis reflects availability of amino acids and carbon source in cells, one might assume that this nucleotide should be involved in the regulation of phage λ development. In fact, in vivostudies revealed that ppGpp is a major factor influencing the lysisversus lysogenization decision (16Slominska M. Neubauer P. Wegrzyn G. Virology. 1999; 262: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The highest efficiency of lysogenization was observed at ppGpp concentrations moderately increased relative to those measured in wild-type bacteria cultivated under standard laboratory conditions. It was demonstrated that ppGpp regulates activities of several λ promoters, including those involved in the lysis versus lysogenization decision (16Slominska M. Neubauer P. Wegrzyn G. Virology. 1999; 262: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Activity of the p R promoter is crucial for effective lystic development of the phage. Therefore, the role that ppGpp-mediated inhibition at λp R plays in the context of overall λ phage physiology appears to be as an environmental “sensor” system, integral to the λ genetic regulatory network, which surveys the physiological state of the host cell at the moment of infection and appropriately dictates the lysisversus lysogeny decision. Although thep L promoter, which is not inhibited by ppGpp, is also active during the lytic development of phage λ, it also directs expression of a gene required for efficient lysogenization, namelycIII. This may be a physiological explanation of different response to ppGpp of the two λ promoters (p Rand p L). We are indepted to Dr. Mike Cashel for his advice and intellectual support of this investigation as well as providing high quality purified ppGpp for in vitrotranscription analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2029653902,"Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) becomes activated and tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins in a variety of cell types, and associates with a number of signaling molecules, structural proteins, and beta integrin cytoplasmic domains. Here we demonstrated that c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress activated protein kinase-associated protein 1 (JSAP1), a scaffold factor in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, forms a complex with the N-terminus of FAK. The complex formation was further stimulated by c-Src, in which JSAP1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated and other FAK/Src signaling molecules were recruited. Fibronectin (FN) stimulation of cells expressing JSAP1 induced its tyrosine phosphorylation concomitant with association with FAK. Expression of JSAP1 in Hela cells facilitated formation of well-organized focal contacts and actin stress fibers, and promoted cell spreading onto FN. Taken together, these results suggest that JSAP1 is involved an integrin-mediated signaling pathway through FAK/Src by recruiting other signaling molecules, resulting in promotion of cell spreading onto FN."

Therefore, p38 MAPK is critically involved in the activation of a shrinkage-induced NSC channel, which plays an important role in the volume regulation of human cervical cancer cells. Homeostasis of cell volume is a fundamental cellular property. Even at constant extracellular osmolarity, cell volume is frequently challenged by transport of osmotically active substances across the cell membrane and formation or disappearance of cellular osmolytes by metabolism (1Lang F. Busch G.L. Ritter M. Volkl H. Waldegger S. Gulbins E. Haussinger D. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 247-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). Thus maintenance of cell volume requires the constant operation of volume regulatory mechanisms, including ion transport across plasma membranes as well as accumulation or disposal of organic osmolytes and metabolites (2Hoffmann E.K. Dunham P.B. Int. Rev. Cyt. 1995; 161: 173-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In response to osmotic swelling, cells extrude ions and certain organic molecules to accomplish regulatory volume decrease (RVD). 1The abbreviations used for: RVD, regulatory volume decrease; NKCC, Na+-K+-2Cl−cotransporter; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NMDG, N-methyl-d-glucamine; GFP, green fluorescent protein; NHE, Na+/H+ exchanger; MEK, MAPK kinase; RVI, regulatory volume increase; NSC, nonselective cation; EIPA, ethylisopropylamiloride; ERK, extracellular-regulated kinase. In most cell types, the predominant pathway for RVD is the activation of separate volume-regulated K+ and Cl− channels (2Hoffmann E.K. Dunham P.B. Int. Rev. Cyt. 1995; 161: 173-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). On the other hand, osmotic shrinkage can activate uptake systems for ions or trigger the expression of transporters for organic osmolytes. Shrunken cells can thereby increase their volume toward their original level by net uptake of Na+, Cl−, and often K+ as well, and concomitant uptake of water (2Hoffmann E.K. Dunham P.B. Int. Rev. Cyt. 1995; 161: 173-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 3Okada Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C755-C789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This process is known as regulatory volume increase (RVI). The major ion transport systems accomplishing electrolyte accumulation in shrunken cells are the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter (NKCC) and the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE). The latter alkalinizes the cell leading to parallel activation of the Cl−/HCO 3− exchanger. The activation of ion channels in response to a hypertonic challenge has received scant attention, although the participation of Na+and nonselective cation (NSC) channels in RVI has been proposed (4Chan H.C. Nelson D.J. Science. 1992; 257: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 5Volk T. Fromter E. Korbmacher C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8478-8482Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, very little is known about the signal pathways underlying the activation of the shrinkage-induced ion channels. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are ubiquitous serine/threonine protein kinases that have been implicated in many cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (6Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3228) Google Scholar, 7Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). MAP kinases can be activated by a variety of external signals, including ultraviolet radiation, various growth factors, and cytokines. Osmotic stress also appears to be an important stimulus for the modulation of MAP kinase family. For example, p38 MAPK represents a human homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HOG-1 gene product, a yeast MAP kinase required for cellular osmoregulation (8Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 9Han J. Richter B. Li Z. Kravchenko V. Ulevitch R.J. Biochim. Biophys.

In addition to the effects on p38, change in cell volume is an important stimulus for modulation of other members of the MAP kinase family, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/ERK2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (11Bode J.G.

An important question is whether the cascades of MAP kinases can regulate membrane ion transport because the main physiological function of these signal pathways is to translate extracellular signals to the nucleus. The physiological role of the shrinkage-induced NSC channels remains elusive. There are two specific aims in the present study: 1) to investigate the effect of cell shrinkage on the whole-cell membrane currents of human cervical cancer cells and characterize the properties of the shrinkage-induced currents, and (2Hoffmann E.K. Dunham P.B. Int. Rev. Cyt. 1995; 161: 173-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) to determine whether signal cascades of MAP kinases are provoked in shrunken cervical cancer cells and, if so, whether these signaling pathways are linked with cell volume regulation. The results demonstrate that osmotic shrinkage of human cervical cancer cells induces an extracellular Cl−-dependent NSC channel, which requires p38 MAPK and plays an important role in volume regulation. The human cervical cancer cell line, SiHa cell, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). These cells, from passage 15 to 35, were maintained at 37 °C in a CO2/air (5–95%) atmosphere and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 80 IU/ml penicillin and 80 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma).

(Beverly, MA): anti-phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser-(217/221)), anti-MEK1/2, anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr-180/Tyr-182) and anti-p38 MAPK. The secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, was also obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The osmolality of solutions was measured using a vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor 5500, Schlag Instruments, Gladbach, Germany). The isotonic solution contained (in mm): NaCl, 140; KCl, 5; MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 1.5; glucose, 10; HEPES, 10; and, titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH (300 ± 2 mosm kg−1,n = 5). The components of the hypertonic solution were the same as those of the isotonic solution except 100 mmmannitol was added (400 ± 2 mosm kg−1,n = 5). In the experiments altering extracellular Ca2+, 1.5 mm EGTA was added to the bath solution, and 1.5 mm CaCl2 was omitted. For testing monovalent cation selectivity, bath Na+ was replaced by an equal amount of Li+, K+, Cs+, Rb+, or NMDG. For testing divalent cation selectivity, 140 mm NaCl was replaced by 70 mmCaCl2 or BaCl2, and the osmolarity was corrected by adding mannitol. The standard pipette solutions contained (in mm): KCl, 140; NaCl, 5; MgCl2, 1; EGTA, 1; HEPES, 10 (300 ± 1 mosm kg−1, n = 5). In some experiments, the pipette solution contained (in mm): KCl, 140; NaCl, 5; MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 1.93; EGTA, 5; HEPES, 10. In this pipette solution, the free intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was buffered at 100 nm, which is below the threshold for the activation of Ca2+-activated Cl− channel (13Shen M.R. Furla P. Chou C.Y. Ellory J.C. Pflügers Arch. 2002; 444: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the [Ca2+]i was buffered to near zero by the following components of pipette solution (in mm): KCl, 140; NaCl, 5; MgCl2, 1; 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), 10; HEPES, 10. All pipette solutions were adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH. The solvent for various chemicals is Me2SO. The final Me2SO concentration in all experiments is less than 0.1%. This Me2SO concentration has no effect on electrophysiological recordings and western immunoblotting. The whole-cell mode of the patch-clamp technique was used to measure membrane currents at room temperature (22–25 °C) as previously described (14Shen M.R. Droogmans G. Eggermont J. Voets T. Ellory J.C. Nilius B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 385-394Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 15Shen M.R. Chou C.Y. Browning J.A. Wilkins R.J. Ellory J.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 347-362Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). When the pipettes were connected to the input stage of an Axopatch-200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA), their DC resistance varied between 2 and 5 mΩ. The current-voltage relationship and time course of the whole-cell membrane current were obtained from either a ramp or a step protocol. The ramp protocol consisted of linear voltage ramps changing from −100 mV to +100 mV within 400 ms, applied every 15 s. The step protocol consisted of a series of 400-ms-long voltage steps applied from a holding potential of −40 mV to voltages between −100 and +100 mV with an increment of 20 mV. Currents were sampled at 2 ms intervals. Current densities were determined by normalizing the whole-cell current to the membrane capacitance, which was 20 ± 1.7 pF (n = 95) in this study. The normalized shrinkage-induced current is defined as the difference in current density between isotonic and hypertonic solutions and is expressed per unit membrane capacitance. To calculate ion permeability, liquid junction potentials were corrected as described previously (16Koch J.P. Korbmacher C. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 177: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reference electrode was an Ag/AgCl pellet bathed in the same solution as that used in the pipette, and connected to the bath via an agar/pipette-solution bridge in the outflow path of the chamber. Liquid junction potentials occurring at the bridge/bath junction were measured using a 3 m KCl flowing boundary electrode and were 4, −2, 3, 0.4, −3, 4, or 5 mV when bath Na+ was replaced by NMDG+, K+, Li+, Cs+, Rb+, Ca2+, and Ba2+, respectively. For data analysis the measured membrane voltage values were corrected accordingly and in the whole-cell current recordings the pipette holding potential was corrected for liquid junction potentials as appropriate. The permeability of various monovalent cations (X+) relative to that of Na+(PX/PNa) was determined from the shift of the reversal potential (ΔVrev) in cation substitution experiments and calculated from the modified Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz Equation 1, Px/PNa=exp[ΔVrev×(F/RT)]Equation 1 where F is the Faraday constant, R the gas constant, and T absolute temperature. Data from electrophysiological experiments were digitized and analyzed using pCLAMP software (Version 6.0.3, Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). To provide genetic evidence that the signal pathways of MEK1/2 and p38 MAPK were involved in the activation of shrinkage-induced currents, transient transfection was used. Using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (17Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4826) Google Scholar), SiHa cells cultured in 6-well plates were cotransfected with green fluorescence protein (GFP, 100 ng/well, Clontech) together with pRSVC4Braf-1 (500 ng/well), or pCMV-FLAG-p38(AGF), (500 ng/well), or with an empty vector (500 ng/well). The pRSVC4Braf-1 encoding dominant-negative mutant of raf-1 (18Chang M.Y. Won S.J. Yang B.C. Jan M.S. Liu H.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. H. S. Liu, Department of Immunology and Microbiology, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan. The pCMV-FLAG-p38(AGF) (a gift from Dr. P. Stambrook, University of Cincinnati) is a kinase-deficient p38 mutant made by substituting threonine with alanine and tyrosine with phenylalanine in the typical TGY sequence of the p38 kinase. Using the ratio (GFP/cDNA of interest = 1:5), more than 90% of the GFP-positive cells also expressed the vector of interest, as determined in separate experiments by immunostaining the epitope tag in dominant-negative raf-1 or p38 mutants. Electrophysiological recordings and cell volume measurements were done 48 h after transfection. SiHa cells, grown in 100-mm dishes to 90% confluence, were starved in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium overnight before experiments. After serum starvation, the culture medium was replaced by isotonic or hypertonic solution at room temperature. At indicated time periods, cells were immediately harvested with ice-cold protein lysis solution containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), 100 mm KCl, 80 mm NaF, 10 mm EGTA, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm vanadate, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. Protein concentrations were determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay. Equal amounts of proteins were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) membranes. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in TBS-T (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were incubated with primary antibodies at 1:1000 dilution in TBS-T overnight at 4 °C, washed with TBS-T four times (10 min/wash), and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase at 1:5000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Following washing with TBS-T for three times, the membrane was developed with enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Phosphorylated levels of MAP kinases were analyzed by scanning densitometry, and the results were expressed as arbitrary units. [Ca2+]iwas measured with the fura-2 fluorescence ratio method on an a fluorimeter (F-2000, spectrophotometer, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) as previously described (15Shen M.R. Chou C.Y. Browning J.A. Wilkins R.J. Ellory J.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 347-362Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Shen M.R. Yang T.P. Tang M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15592-15599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In brief, cells attached on coverslips were loaded with 2 μm fura-2/acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2/AM) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium culture medium at room temperature for 40 min and then at 37 °C for 20 min. After loading, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. After washing, the coverslip was mounted in a custom-made holder and placed in a 5-ml quartz cuvette. Fluorescence emission was collected from a group of ∼105 cells located in the excitation path. Excitation wavelength was alternated between 340 nm (I340) and 380 nm (I380), and fluorescence intensity was monitored at 510 nm. [Ca2+]i was calculated from the I340/I380 ratio using Equation 2 proposed by Grynkiewicz, Poenie, and Tsien (20Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), [Ca2+]i=Kd×(Fmin/Fmax)×[(R−Rmin)/(Rmax−R)]Equation 2 where K d is the dissociation constant for fura-2 in the cytosol (250 nm), Fmin and Rmin are the 380 nm fluorescence intensity, and I340/I380 ratio at low [Ca2+]i, respectively. Fmax and Rmax are the 380-nm fluorescence intensity and I340/I380 ratio at high [Ca2+]i, and R is the I340/I380 ratio recorded during experiments. Calibration measurements of Fmin and Rmin were performed after incubating cells for 10 min in nominally Ca2+-free isotonic solution containing 3 mmEGTA. Cells were then superfused with isotonic solution containing 1 μm thapsigargin, 5 μm ionomycin, and 10 mm Ca2+ to evaluate Fmax and Rmax. Cell volume was measured as described previously (15Shen M.R. Chou C.Y. Browning J.A. Wilkins R.J. Ellory J.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 347-362Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Shen M.R. Yang T.P. Tang M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15592-15599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested, transferred, and allowed to achieve cell attachment in Petri dish for ∼30 min. A 2-ml bath, which was continuously superfused with isotonic solution or hypertonic solution, was then applied. Cells were viewed with magnification up to ×400 by an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope, which was equipped with Hoffman modulation optics (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). In order to monitor the change of cell size, the microscope was coupled to a video camera system and the images were recorded in real time and stored on a video cassette recorder (Panasonic Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Images were then analyzed by the public domain NIH Image program. The majority of cells observed were spheroid and the relative volume change (V/Vo) was calculated from the cross-sectional surface area at the beginning (So) of experiment and during (S) the experiments from the relation: V/Vo = (S/So)3/2 (15Shen M.R. Chou C.Y. Browning J.A. Wilkins R.J. Ellory J.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 347-362Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Shen M.R. Yang T.P. Tang M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15592-15599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Data were presented as the percentage of starting volume (V/Vo), as a function of time. The validity of this approach to measure cell volume has been demonstrated in mouse thymocytes (21Ross P.E. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 415-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), renal A6 cells (22Urbach V. Leguen I. O'Kelly I. Harvey B.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 168: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), lymphocytes (23Lepple-Wienhues A. Szabo I. Laun T. Kaba N.K. Gulbins E. Lang F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and human cervical cancer cells (19Shen M.R. Yang T.P. Tang M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15592-15599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All values in the present study were reported as mean ± S.E. Student's paired or unpaired t test was used for statistical analyses. Differences between values were considered significantly when p < 0.05. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were made from cervical cancer SiHa cells with simultaneous measurement of membrane current and cell diameter. Membrane currents recorded during the ramp protocol applied to SiHa cells in isotonic solutions were small (Fig.1 A). Application of a hypertonic solution (400 mosm kg−1) induced an obvious cell shrinkage, which was accompanied by an activation of mild outwardly rectifying currents (Fig. 1, A and B). The time courses of channel activity and cell diameter indicates that there is a good correlation of membrane current and cell volume changes. Membrane currents were also recorded during the step protocol applied to SiHa cells (Fig. 2 A). The basal membrane currents were small (−4.1 ± 0.4 pA pF−1 at −80 mV, n = 36) and time-independent (Fig. 2 A). Replacement of Na+in the bath solution by the impermeable cation NMDG only slightly decreased the inward current. Application of a hypertonic solution (400 mosm kg−1) induced a 7-fold increase of inward current from −4.1 ± 0.4 pA pF−1 to −29 ± 1.1 pA pF−1 measured at −80 mV (n = 36,p < 0.001). The hypertonicity-induced currents did not exhibit any major voltage-dependent activation or inactivation when voltage pulses of 400 ms duration were applied between −100 and +100 mV (Fig. 2 A). The current-voltage relationship in hypertonic solution, obtained from the step protocols, reversed close to the theoretical equilibrium potential for cations (Ecation = 0 mV) with the standard bath and pipette solutions. This shrinkage-induced current is reversible after changing back to the isotonic bath solution. The cation selectivity of the shrinkage-induced current was investigated further. Following the plateau phase of current stimulation in the hypertonic solution, extracellular Na+was replaced by the monovalent cation Li+, K+, Cs+, Rb+, or NMDG. The replacement of extracellular Na+ with the impermeable cation NMDG shifted the reversal potential from −0.5 ± 1.6 mV to −50 ± 3.1 mV (n = 6) and abolished the shrinkage-induced inward current (Fig. 2, A and B), whereas replacement by Li+, K+, Cs+, or Rb+only slightly changed the inward currents. The sequence of cation permeability, calculated from the shifts in reversal potential, was Na+ : Li+ : K+ : Cs+ : Rb+ : NMDG+ = 1 : 0.91 ± 0.08 (n = 3): 1.07 ± 0.07 (n = 5) : 0.88 ± 0.08 (n = 3) : 1.08 ± 0.09 (n = 3) : 0.13 ± 0.05 (n = 6) (Fig. 2 C). This indicates that the shrinkage-induced currents discriminate poorly among these monovalent cations. To investigate whether the shrinkage-induced currents will carry divalent cations, we performed experiments in which extracellular 140 mm NaCl was replaced with 70 mmCaCl2 at the plateau phase of current stimulation in the hypertonic condition. Preliminary experiments (n = 5) indicated that with a standard pipette solution containing 1 mm EGTA a change of the bath solution to 70 mmCaCl2 could raise the cytosol Ca2+ sufficiently to activate Ca2+-activated Cl− channels, which have been demonstrated in cervical cancer SiHa cells (13Shen M.R. Furla P. Chou C.Y. Ellory J.C. Pflügers Arch. 2002; 444: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To prevent the interference from these Ca2+-activated Cl−channels, we used pipette solutions containing 10 mm BAPTA. A typical experiment with 10 mm BAPTA in the pipette solution is shown in Fig. 3, Aand B. During hypertonic stimulation, replacement of extracellular Na+ with Ca2+ decreased significantly the inward currents and was accompanied with a change of the reversal potential from −0.3 ± 0.6 mV to −60.8 ± 2.5 mV (n = 6). Similar effects were observed in the replacement of Na+ with Ba2+ (n= 3). These results suggest that shrinkage-induced NSC channels are poorly permeable to divalent cations. [Ca2+]i was subsequently measured to ascertain no Ca2+ entry during cell shrinkage. Superfusion of SiHa cells with the hypertonic solution elicited a rise of [Ca2+]i from the basal level of 105 ± 6 nm to a peak of 145 ± 5 nm(p < 0.05, Student's paired t test,n = 12 experiments). In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, the basal [Ca2+]i was 50 ± 5 nm and hypertonicity induced an increase of [Ca2+]i to 88 ± 5 nm (Fig. 3 C, p < 0.05, Student's paired t test, n = 12 experiments). The pattern of [Ca2+]i rising in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ is very similar to that in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. More importantly, the shrinkage-induced increase of [Ca2+]i(Δ[Ca2+]i) is independent of extracellular Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 3 D). These results suggest the Δ[Ca2+]i results mainly from internal release. We further investigated whether the activation of the shrinkage-induced NSC channel depends on Ca2+ signaling. As shown in Fig.4 A, whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were obtained at the standard recording condition, in which the pipette solution contained 1 mm EGTA with 1.5 mm CaCl2 in the extracellular solution. Membrane currents recorded during the step protocol applied to SiHa cells in isotonic solutions were small and time-independent. Application of a hypertonic solution induced cell shrinkage, which was accompanied by the shrinkage-induced current of −26 ± 1.1 pA pF−1 measured at −80 mV (Fig. 4, control group, n = 24). This shrinkage-induced current was not changed when [Ca2+]i increased to 100 nm (n = 6, Fig. 4, B andD). Similarly, the current was not significantly decreased when [Ca2+]i was buffered to near zero by 10 mm BAPTA in the pipette solution as well as the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 4, C andD). Interestingly, removal of extracellular Cl− by replacement with the impermeable anion gluconate decreased significantly the amplitude of shrinkage-induced currents without changing the reversal potential (Fig. 5). For example, when [Cl−]o was decreased from 145 to 70 or 35 mm, the shrinkage-induced current measured at −80 mV was reduced by 35 ± 3% (n = 6, p < 0.05) and 70 ± 3% (n = 6, p < 0.01), respectively (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, replacement of extracellular Cl− with equimolar amounts of Br− or I− did not produce either a shift of reversal potential or a decrease in the amplitude of the shrinkage-induced currents (n = 4). Furthermore, lowering the intracellular Cl− concentration from 145 to 70 mm by changing the pipette solutions (i.e.140 mm KCl and 5 mm NaCl were changed to 65 mm KCl, 75 mm K-aspartate and 5 mmNaCl) failed to affect the reversal potential or the amplitude of shrinkage-induced currents (n = 4). These results indicate the possible presence of an external anion binding site, which may act a modulator for the shrinkage-induced cation conductance. Gd3+ is a known inhibitor of NSC channel (4Chan H.C. Nelson D.J. Science. 1992; 257: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,5Volk T. Fromter E. Korbmacher C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8478-8482Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, Gd3+inhibited the shrinkage-induced NSC channel in a dose-dependent manner. However, by contrast, activation of the shrinkage-induced current was not sensitive to 10 and 50 μm bumetanide (n = 5), an inhibitor of the basolateral membrane Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter (F"
https://openalex.org/W2068484812,"Bacteriophage T7 gp4A' protein is a hexameric helicase-primase protein that separates the strands of a duplex DNA in a reaction coupled to dTTP hydrolysis. Here we reexamine in more detail the kinetic mechanism of dTTP hydrolysis by a preassembled T7 helicase hexamer in the absence of DNA. Pre-steady state dTTP hydrolysis kinetics showed a distinct burst whose amplitude indicated that a preformed hexamer of T7 helicase hydrolyzes on an average one dTTP per hexamer. The pre-steady state chase-time experiments provided evidence for sequential hydrolysis of two dTTPs. The medium [(18)O]P(i) exchange experiments failed to detect dTTP synthesis, indicating that the less than six-site hydrolysis observed is not due to reversible dTTP hydrolysis on the helicase active site. The P(i)-release rate was measured directly using a stopped-flow fluorescence assay, and it was found that the rate of dTTP hydrolysis on the helicase active site is eight times faster than the P(i)-release rate, which in turn is three times faster than the dTDP release rate. Thus, the rate-limiting step in the pathway of helicase-catalyzed deoxythymidine triphosphatase (dTTPase) reaction is the release of dTDP. Chase-time dTTPase kinetics in the steady state phase provided evidence for two to three slowly hydrolyzing dTTPase sites on the hexamer. The results of this study are therefore consistent with those reported earlier (Hingorani, M. M., Washington, M. T., Moore, K. C., and Patel, S. S. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 94, 5012-5017), and they support a model of dTTP hydrolysis by T7 helicase hexamer that is similar to the binding change mechanism of F(1)-ATPase with dTTP hydrolysis occurring sequentially at the catalytic sites."
https://openalex.org/W2319930820,"bcl-2 was the first regulator of apoptosis shown to be involved in oncogenesis. Subsequent studies in mammals, in the nematode and in Drosophila revealed wide evolutionary conservation of the regulation of apoptosis. Although dbok/debcl, a member of the bcl-2 gene family described in Drosophila, shows pro-apoptotic activities, no anti-apoptotic bcl-2 family gene has been studied in Drosophila. We have previously reported that the human anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2 is functional in Drosophila, suggesting that the fruit fly shares regulatory mechanisms with vertebrates and the nematode, involving anti-apoptotic members of the bcl-2 family. We now report that bcl-2 suppresses rpr-induced apoptosis in Drosophila. Additionally, we have compared features of bax- and rpr-induced apoptosis. Flow cytometry analysis of wing disc cells demonstrate that both killers trigger mitochondrial defects. Interestingly, bcl-2 suppresses both bax- and rpr-induced mitochondrial defects while the caspase-inhibitor p35 is specific to the rpr pathway. Finally, we show that the inhibition of apoptosis by bcl-2 is associated with the down-regulation of rpr expression."

In the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> the <i>RAD6</i>epistasis group defines a more poorly characterized set of DNA damage response pathways, believed to be distinct from NER. Here we show that the elimination of the DNA minor groove adducts formed by an important class of anticancer antibiotic (CC-1065 family) requires NER factors in<i>S. cerevisiae</i>. We also demonstrate that the elimination of this class of minor groove adduct from the active <i>MFA2</i> gene depends upon functional Rad18 and Rad6. This is most clear for the repair of adducts on the transcribed strand, where an absolute requirement for Rad6 and Rad18 was seen. Further experiments revealed that a specific <i>RAD6-RAD18</i>-controlled subpathway, the<i>RAD5</i> branch, mediates these events. Cells disrupted for<i>rad5</i> are highly sensitive to this minor groove binding agent, and <i>rad5</i> cells exhibit an <i>in vivo</i> adduct elimination defect indistinguishable from that seen in <i>rad6</i>and <i>rad18</i> cells as well as in NER-defective cells.
