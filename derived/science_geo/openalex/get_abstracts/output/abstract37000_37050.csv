https://openalex.org/W2155009866,"Monkey cells synthesizing SV40 large T antigen were lysed and the extracts immunoprecipitated with either monoclonal anti-T antibody or monoclonal antibody to p110-114, the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb). T and p110-114 coprecipitated in each case, implying that the proteins are complexed with each other. Substitution and internal deletion mutants of T that contain structural alterations in a ten residue, transformation-controlling domain failed to complex with p110-114. In contrast, T mutants bearing structural changes outside of this domain bound to p110-114. These results are consistent with a model for transformation by SV40 which, at least in part, involves T/p110-114 complex formation and the perturbation of Rb protein and/or T function."
https://openalex.org/W2035975217,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has been associated with loss of heterozygosity at several distinct genetic loci including chromosomes 3p, 13q, and 17p. To determine whether the retinoblastoma gene (Rb) localized at 13q14, might be the target of recessive mutations in lung cancer, eight primary SCLC tumors and 50 cell lines representing all major histologic types of lung cancer were examined with the Rb complementary DNA probe. Structural abnormalities within the Rb gene were observed in 1/8 (13%) primary SCLC tumors, 4/22 (18%) SCLC lines, and 1/4 (25%) pulmonary carcinoid lines (comparable to the 20 to 40% observed in retinoblastoma), but were not detected in other major types of lung cancer. Rb messenger RNA expression was absent in 60% of the SCLC lines and 75% of pulmonary carcinoid lines, including all samples with DNA abnormalities. In contrast, Rb transcripts were found in 90% of non-SCLC lung cancer lines and in normal human lung. The finding of abnormalities of the Rb gene in SCLC and pulmonary carcinoids (both neuroendocrine tumors) suggests that this gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of a common adult malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W2002601205,"Like other viruses that infect primate cells, the human T lymphotropic virus-I (HTLV-I) stimulates production of some host cell proteins. In particular, HTLV-I infected T cells synthesize interleukin-2 receptor alpha (IL-2R alpha) chain, which is probably induced through the mediation of the tat-I gene product of the virus. Activated T cells contain a trascription factor called NF-kappa B, which stimulates the expression of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) by binding to an 11-base-pair enhancer sequence called kappa B. We have now found evidence that a similar transcription factor is involved in the induction of IL-2R alpha expression by tat-I. We have identified a sequence upstream of IL-2R alpha which is the same as the kappa B site at 9 of 11 base pairs, competes for binding to the kappa B sequence, and serves as a tat-I responsive element when multiple copies are inserted upstream of a heterologous promoter. The tat-I product also induces kappa B and the IL-2R alpha kappa B binding activity in transfected Jurkat T lymphoid leukaemia cells. Both HTLV-I and HIV-1 thus interact with NF-kappa B-like transcription factors which might normally regulate expression of a growth factor receptor gene."
https://openalex.org/W2097228095,"Although steroid hormone receptors are known to activate gene expression by binding to specific hormone-dependent enhancers, the mechanisms by which steroids inhibit the transcription of specific genes are unknown. It is shown here by gene transfer studies that the same glucocorticoid receptor that activates gene expression can negatively regulate expression of the human glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit gene. Glucocorticoid inhibition was conferred by a 52-nucleotide region that also contains elements crucial both for adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) responsiveness and for placental-specific expression of this gene and was observed only under conditions in which these elements were functioning as enhancers. Purified glucocorticoid receptor was found to bind to DNA that overlap the cAMP responsive elements sites in this region. It is hypothesized that steroid receptors negatively regulate gene expression by interfering with the activity or binding of other important transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2019698681,"Expression of the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R alpha) gene is activated by the transcriptional activator protein, Tax (previously referred to as the tat gene product), encoded by the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-I). Multiple protein binding sites for specific DNA-protein interactions were identified over the upstream IL-2R alpha transcriptional regulatory sequences. However, only one region, which includes the sequence motif GGGGAATCTCCC, was required for activation by both the tax gene product and mitogenic stimulation. Remarkably, this sequence also bound the nuclear factor NF kappa B, which is important for induction of kappa-immunoglobulin gene expression. A model is presented whereby regulation of cellular gene expression by the HTLV-I tax gene product occurs via an indirect mechanism that may involve a post-translational modification of preexistent cellular transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2055724834,"Brownian dynamics computer simulations of the diffusional association of electron transport proteins cytochrome c (cyt c) and cytochrome c peroxidase (cyt c per) were performed. A highly detailed and realistic model of the protein structures and their electrostatic interactions was used that was based on an atomic-level spatial description. Several structural features played a role in enhancing and optimizing the electron transfer efficiency of this reaction. Favorable electrostatic interactions facilitated long-lived nonspecific encounters between the proteins that allowed the severe orientational criteria for reaction to be overcome by rotational diffusion during encounters. Thus a ""reduction-in-dimensionality"" effect operated. The proteins achieved plausible electron transfer orientations in a multitude of electrostatically stable encounter complexes, rather than in a single dominant complex."

https://openalex.org/W1573745866,"Sodium ion and chloride transport was studied in vitro in small intestinal and colonic tissue from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and from non-CF control subjects matched as to age and sex. Normal histological appearance and substantial response to mucosal glucose (5 mM, ileum) or mucosal amiloride (10(-5) M, colon) indicated normal tissue viability in both control and CF tissues. Electroneutral NaCl absorption was demonstrated in the small intestine of control subjects and CF patients. Small intestinal and colonic tissues of control subjects responded to four secretagogues (theophylline, 5 mM; prostaglandin E2, 10(-6) M; calcium ionophore (A23187), 10(-5) M; bethanechol, 5 x 10(-5) M), with electrogenic chloride secretion. The tissues of CF patients, however, did not respond to any of the test secretagogues. These studies demonstrate that an abnormality in chloride transport is present in the small intestinal and colonic epithelia of CF patients. Unlike airway epithelia, which secrete chloride in response to Ca ionophore, the intestinal epithelia of CF patients do not respond to either cAMP- or Ca-mediated secretagogues. This abnormality in intestinal electrolyte transport may play a role in the pathogenesis of meconium impactions in CF patients."
https://openalex.org/W1540694566,"Human eosinophils, stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate, were found to produce 1268 nm chemiluminescence characteristic of singlet oxygen. Singlet oxygen generation required the presence of bromide ion. A bromide ion concentration of 100 microM, comparable to the total bromine content of whole blood, was sufficient for the eosinophils to generate measurable amounts of singlet oxygen. For the conditions used (10(7) cells/ml and 10 micrograms/ml phorbol myristate acetate), the duration of the singlet oxygen generation was brief, about 5 min, and the total yield of singlet oxygen was modest, 1.0 +/- 0.1 microM. The cells remained viable after the singlet oxygen production ceased. This is the first demonstration of singlet oxygen production from living cells. The singlet oxygen generated by eosinophils likely results from a peroxidase-catalyzed mechanism, since a purified eosinophil peroxidase-hydrogen peroxide-bromide system was also shown to produce singlet oxygen. The unique properties of eosinophil peroxidase are illustrated by the fact that at p2H 7.0 and with 100 microM bromide, eosinophil peroxidase generated 20 +/- 2% of the theoretical yield of singlet oxygen, whereas under identical conditions, myeloperoxidase and lactoperoxidase produced only 1.0 +/- 0.1% and -0.1 +/- 0.1%, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1981026726,"Transmission and growth of HIV-1 produced from the biologically active clone HTLV-III/HXB2D in the constant presence of a neutralizing antiserum yielded a viral population specifically resistant to neutralization by the same antiserum. Molecular clones MX-1 and -2, containing the entire envelope gene, were obtained from cultures of the resistant variant. The coding regions for the large envelope protein and most of the transmembrane envelope protein of two such clones were substituted for the homologous segment of HXB2D. Infectious viruses from these constructs were also specifically resistant to neutralization by the selecting antiserum. The exchanged fragment contained only one base change, resulting in an Ala----Thr replacement at position 582. When this substitution was introduced into HXB2D it conferred the resistant phenotype. Thus, small differences may be selected for in vivo by the host immune response and result in relatively large differences in susceptibility of the virus to such a response."

https://openalex.org/W2013855627,"The mouse-adapted strain of poliovirus type 2 (Lansing) induces fatal poliomyelitis in mice after intracerebral inoculation, whereas mice inoculated with poliovirus type 1 (Mahoney) show no signs of disease. Previous work indicated that the adaptation to mouse virulence is associated with the viral capsid proteins and that mutations in neutralization antigenic site I of poliovirus reduce neurovirulence of the Lansing strain in mice. The role of antigenic site I in mouse neurovirulence was further explored by constructing an antigenic hybrid virus. Six amino acids in antigenic site I of the Mahoney strain were replaced with a sequence specific for the Lansing strain by using a mutagenesis cartridge. The hybrid virus was neutralized by polyclonal antisera elicited by the type 1 and type 2 strains of poliovirus and by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies directed against antigenic site I of type 2 virus. The hybrid virus induced paralytic disease in mice, an observation demonstrating that a short sequence of amino acids in antigenic site I is an important determinant of poliovirus host range. Antigenic site I may be involved in attachment of poliovirus to cells of the mouse central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2124225756,"A large array of satellite DNA sequences are always associated with the Responder (Rsp) element of Segregation Distorter in D. melanogaster. In the appropriate genetic backgrounds, Rsp causes aberrant chromatin condensation in spermiogenesis, leading to dysfunction of sperm carrying Rsp, and meiotic drive. The repeat array is deleted or translocated to the Y chromosome whenever Rsp is. Moreover, the translocation of part of Rsp to Y is associated with the translocation of an incomplete repeat array. The number of repeats among 35 independently derived chromosomes correlates nearly perfectly with sensitivity to distortion. We hypothesize that this satellite repeat array represents Responder itself. Finally, the molecular structure of this locus is extremely variable, indicating a very active process of change."
https://openalex.org/W1997754115,"Sodium, potassium-adenosine triphosphatase (Na + ,K + -ATPase) is hypothesized to be involved in systemic vascular hypertension through its effects on smooth muscle reactivity and myocardial contractility. By means of RNA blot analyses of cardiac, aortic, and skeletal muscle RNAs in two rat hypertensive models, Na + ,K + -ATPase α-subunit messenger RNA isoforms (α2 and α3) were shown to be deinduced in response to increased intravascular pressure. The changes were observed after 48 hours or more of experimental hypertension. Under these conditions, there is coordinate induction of another α isoform (α1) and of β-subunit messenger RNAs, probably in response to alterations in sodium flux rather than to elevated blood pressure."
https://openalex.org/W1544494533,"The HEM13 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae codes for coproporphyrinogen oxidase (EC 1.3.3.3) catalyzing the sixth enzymic step in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Its expression has been previously shown to be regulated negatively by heme and oxygen. We have isolated the HEM13 gene by functional complementation of a hem13 gene by functional complementation of a hem13 mutant and determined its nucleotide sequence. The open reading frame encodes a protein of 328 amino acids. Its calculated molecular weight (37,673), amino acid composition and amino-terminal sequence predicted from the DNA sequence are in agreement with those determined for the native enzyme (Camadro, J. M., Chambon, H., Jolles, J., and Labbe, P. (1986) Eur. J. Biochem. 156, 579-587). The 5' ends of the HEM13 transcripts were identified by nuclease S1 mapping; induction of HEM13 resulted in an equivalent increase of the level of all the transcripts. 5' deletion analysis revealed that DNA sequence located upstream of 409 nucleotides from the translational initiation codon was needed for depression under oxygen limitation. The loss of induction of coproporphyrinogen oxidase activity by anaerobiosis caused a considerable decrease of heme formation in anaerobic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1590061771,"Abstract Mo1 (CD11b), a glycoprotein heterodimer that is involved in cellular adhesion processes and functions as the C3bi receptor of human myeloid cells, and T200 (CD45), a panleukocyte glycoprotein family whose function is still not well understood, increased their expression in the plasma membrane of human neutrophils after exposure to various stimuli which induce degranulation, such as formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine or calcium ionophore A23187. This increment in the expression of both molecules shows a good correlation with the release to the extracellular environment of gelatinase, a marker for an intracellular organelle named granule (Mollinedo, F., and Schneider, D. L. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 7143-7150). Flow cytometry studies indicate that at least 50% of the total Mo1 and T200 molecules are located in intracellular organelles. Furthermore, the subcellular distribution of Mo1 and T200 glycoproteins in resting human neutrophils was investigated by immunoprecipitation of the radiolabeled membrane proteins obtained from the distinct subcellular fractions. Both Mo1 and T200 were mainly localized in tertiary or specific intracellular granules, which were resolved from the azurophilic granules as well as from the cell membrane fraction. These findings suggest that the mobilization of intracellular Mo1 and T200 to the plasma membrane may regulate early events occurring upon neutrophil activation."
https://openalex.org/W1493538670,"We have previously purified and characterized a Dictyostelium myosin II heavy chain kinase which phosphorylates threonine residues (Cote, G. P., and Bukiejko, U. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 1065-1072). The phosphorylated threonines are located within a 34-kDa fragment which can be selectively cleaved from the carboxyl terminal end of the Dictyostelium myosin II tail. Tryptic and chymotryptic digests of the 34-kDa fragment phosphorylated with the kinase have now been performed and the resulting phosphopeptides isolated and sequenced. Two phosphorylated threonine residues have been identified, corresponding to residues 1833 and 2029 in the complete amino acid sequence of the Dictyostelium myosin II heavy chain. These amino acids are 87 and 283 residues, respectively, distant from the carboxyl terminus of the Dictyostelium myosin II heavy chain and are present in sections of the tail which seem to be alpha-helical coiled coils. In contrast, the three Acanthamoeba myosin II heavy chain phosphorylation sites are located within 10 residues of each other in a small globular domain at the carboxyl terminal tip of the tail (Cote, G. P., Robinson, E. A., Appella, E., and Korn, E. D. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12781-12787). This suggests that the mechanism by which heavy chain phosphorylation inhibits the actin-activated ATPase activity and filament-forming properties of the two myosins may be quite different."
https://openalex.org/W1600116810,"The cell dynamics of the receptor for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were examined in TNF-sensitive KYM cells derived from human myosarcoma. With receptor synthesis inhibited by cycloheximide, the half-life of the surface TNF receptor was 2 h in the absence of TNF and 30 min in its presence, suggesting that the TNF receptor is non-recycling and that its internalization is accelerated by TNF. During cell incubation with TNF receptor degradation suppressed by chloroquine, the number of surface TNF receptors remained approximately constant, but the total number of surface and internal TNF receptors increased gradually, at 3 h reaching 1.5 times the initial number, thus suggesting continuous synthesis, externalization, internalization, and degradation of the TNF receptor in the absence of cycloheximide. On cell incubation with 125I-TNF, the intracellular quantity of the pulse-labeled TNF-receptor complex promptly increased, reaching a maximum at 20 min, and then gradually declined, thus confirming that the TNF receptor is internalized as a TNF-receptor complex in the presence of TNF. During incubations with protein synthesis suppressed by cycloheximide following surface TNF receptor digestion by trypsin, TNF receptors reappeared on the cell surface, increasing in number to a peak at 60 min and gradually decreasing, and cells previously exposed to cycloheximide with or without TNF showed no recurrence of surface TNF receptors, suggesting that the TNF receptor is non-recycling. The results of the study thus suggest that the TNF receptor is continuously internalized and degraded intracellularly by lysosomes without being recycled regardless of the presence or absence of TNF and, further, that its internalization is accelerated when it is part of the TNF-receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1481451080,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a monokine that induces pleiotropic events in both transformed and normal cells. These effects are initiated by the binding of TNF to high affinity cell surface receptors. The post-receptor events and signaling mechanisms induced by TNF, however, have remained unknown. The present studies demonstrate the presence of a single class of high affinity receptors on membranes prepared from HL-60 promyelocytic leukemic cells. The interaction of TNF with these membrane receptors was associated with a 3.8-fold increase in specific binding of the GTP analogue, GTP gamma S. Scatchard analysis of GTP gamma S binding data demonstrated that TNF stimulates GTP binding by increasing the affinity of available sites. The TNF-induced stimulation of GTP binding was also associated with an increase in GTPase activity. Moreover, the increase in GTPase activity induced by TNF was sensitive to pertussis toxin. The results also demonstrate that TNF similarly increased GTP binding and pertussis toxin-sensitive GTPase activity in membranes from mouse L929 fibroblasts, thus indicating that these effects are not limited to hematopoietic cells. Analysis of HL-60 membranes after treatment with pertussis toxin in the presence of [32P]NAD revealed three substrates with relative molecular masses of approximately Mr 41,000, 40,000, and 30,000. In contrast, L929 cell membranes had only two detectable pertussis toxin substrates of approximately Mr 41,000 and 40,000. Although the Mr 41,000 pertussis toxin substrate represents the guanine nucleotide-binding inhibitory protein Gi, the identities of the Mr 40,000 and Mr 30,000 substrates remain unclear. In any event, inhibition of the TNF-induced increase in GTPase activity and ADP-ribosylation of Gi by pertussis toxin suggested that TNF might act by increasing GTPase activity of the Gi protein. However, the results further indicate that TNF has no detectable effect on basal or prostaglandin E2-stimulated cAMP levels in HL-60 cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein other than Gi, and possibly the Mr 40,000 substrate, is involved in the action of TNF. Finally, the demonstration that pertussis toxin inhibited TNF-induced cytotoxicity in L929 cells supports the presence of a GTP-binding protein which couples TNF-induced signaling to a biologic effect."
https://openalex.org/W207929025,"The effect of dopamine, working through the activation of D2 receptors, on inositol phosphate production induced by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) was investigated in rat pituitary lactotroph cells. Dopamine (10 microM) did not modify the initial rapid stimulation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and inositol bisphosphate observed within the first 15 s after TRH addition, but progressively inhibited the later inositol phosphate production induced by the neurohormone. This kinetics of inhibition was independent of dopamine preincubation time (from 2 to 10 min). The effect was still visible when dopamine was added after TRH. It was sensitive to pertussis toxin, was unchanged by increasing cellular cAMP levels with 8-Br-cAMP, but was greatly affected by treatments that modify the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration. Specifically, the dopamine-induced inhibition was prevented by treatment of the cells with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (100-200 nM) and was mimicked either by withdrawal of Ca2+ from the incubation medium or by blockade of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels with verapamil. The dopamine treatment did not decrease the cellular levels of the various phosphoinositides, strongly suggesting that the inhibition of inositol phosphate production is not due to precursor depletion. In isolated membranes, however, dopamine was unable to counteract the inositol phosphate accumulation triggered by TRH. Taken together, the data indicate that inhibition of inositol phosphate production is not a primary event triggered by D2 receptor activation, but is a late consequence, due to the previously demonstrated (Malgaroli, A., Vallar, L., Reza Elahi, F., Pozzan, T., Spada, A., and Meldolesi, J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 13920-13927) inhibition by dopamine of the prolonged cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration increase induced by TRH via the activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. These results are inconsistent with the possibility of a direct inhibitory coupling of D2 receptors to phospholipase C in rat pituitary lactotroph cells."
https://openalex.org/W1594764193,"Abstract Human pulmonary surfactant proteolipid of Mr = 5,000, now termed surfactant protein C (SP-C), is produced by proteolytic processing of an Mr = 22,000 precursor. The active hydrophobic peptide imparts surface active properties to pulmonary surfactant phospholipids. We have determined the entire nucleotide sequence of two distinct genes encoding SP-C from a genomic library prepared from human leukocytes. SP-C genes were encoded by approximately 3.0 kilobase pairs of DNA containing six exons and five introns. In both genes, the active hydrophobic region of the polypeptide was located in the second exon that encodes a peptide of 53 amino acids. The entire nucleotide sequences of the two classes of SP-C genes differed by only 1%. Two cDNAs encoding SP-C were distinguished on the basis of an 18-nucleotide deletion at the beginning of the fifth exon; no such deletion was detected within the two classes of SP-C genes. Comparison of the 3'-untranslated regions of SP-C cDNA clones and the two classes of genomic clones demonstrated that cDNAs with and without the 18-base pair deletion could be derived from both of the genes. This 18-base pair deletion occurs in nucleotide sequences compatible with two distinct RNA splice sites. One additional cDNA clone showed the addition of an 8-base pair insert at the end of exon 5, which was also compatible with two distinct splice sites. Both classes of SP-C genes were represented by cDNAs, demonstrating that both classes of genes are actively transcribed. The two SP-C genes were readily distinguished on the basis of their nucleotide sequences and restriction fragment analyses of their flanking DNA. Two distinct classes of human SP-C genes are transcribed, and the heterogeneity in the SP-C RNAs appears to result from differential splicing."
https://openalex.org/W1561405046,"Properties of the methotrexate (MTX) transport carrier were examined in a stable single-step 16-fold MTX-resistant L1210 murine leukemia cell line with unchanged dihydrofolate reductase gene copy and thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase levels and activities. MTX influx was markedly depressed due to a decrease in Vmax without a change in Km. From this cell line a clonal variant with greater resistance to MTX was identified due solely to a further decrease in influx Vmax. Trans-stimulation of MTX influx by 5-formyltetrahydrofolate was induced in parental but not resistant cells. Analysis of specific MTX surface binding demonstrated a small increase in the number of carriers in the first- and second-step resistant lines. Affinity labeling of cells with an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester derivative of [3H]MTX demonstrated carriers with comparable molecular weights in the parent and second-step transport defective lines. In two partial revertants with increased MTX sensitivity isolated from the second-step resistant lines, MTX influx was increased but surface membrane-binding sites were unchanged suggesting that recovery of transport was due to normalization of carrier function rather than an increase in the number of carriers. These studies suggest that impaired MTX transport in these lines is not due to an alteration in the association of the transport carrier with its substrate at the cell surface. Rather, resistance may be due to an alteration in the mobility of the carrier possibly associated with a protein change in the carrier itself or the cell membrane that surrounds it."
https://openalex.org/W1581440449,"Expression of the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene was examined in normal human lymphocytes and lymphocyte cell lines infected by lymphotropic viruses. POMC gene transcripts were detected in human lymphocytes using stringent RNA-RNA hybridizations. Low transcript levels were found in normal phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in tonsillar T and B cells. The highest levels were found in cells infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). However, T cell lines infected with human T lymphotropic viruses did not have increased levels of transcripts. The transcript levels in an EBV-transformed B lymphocyte line were not affected by dexamethasone or corticotropin-releasing hormone, known regulators of anterior pituitary POMC gene expression. Therefore, it is possible that EBV infections could result in abnormal POMC expression."
https://openalex.org/W1584396549,"We have established by transient expression experiments that the 620 base pairs upstream of the cap site of the human transferrin gene contain the information necessary for efficient expression of the gene in hepatoma cells HepG2 or Hep3B but not in HeLa cells. DNase I footprint analysis reveals that at least five distinct factors present in human or rat liver nuclear extracts interact with different sites of this region. One of these factors, binding to nucleotides -193 to -162, is closely related to or identical with the eukaryotic factor CCAAT-binding transcription factor/nuclear factor I; another one, binding to nucleotides -103 to -83 seems to be related to the CCAAT-binding protein. The binding sites of two other factors, not recognized by HeLa nuclear proteins, each contain an identical 10-nucleotide-long sequence (5′ TCTTTGACCT 3′) in reverse orientation, separated by 400 base pairs. Results of gel retardation assays, cross-competition experiments, and heat inactivation strongly suggest that the proteins binding to these sites are different. One of these sequences and the binding site of the CCAAT-binding protein related factor are located in the region between nucleotides -119 and -45. We have shown by transient expression experiments with 3′ deleted vectors that this region is functionally essential for human transferrin gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1503858891,"Reactions at the replication fork of bacteriophage T7 have been reconstituted in vitro on a preformed replication fork. A minimum of three proteins is required to catalyze leading and lagging strand synthesis. The T7 gene 4 protein, which exists in two forms of molecular weight 56,000 and 63,000, provides helicase and primase activities. A tight complex of the T7 gene 5 protein and Escherichia coli thioredoxin provides DNA polymerase activity. Gene 4 protein and DNA polymerase catalyze processive leading strand synthesis. Gene 4 protein molecules serving as helicase remain bound to the template as leading strand synthesis proceeds greater than 40 kilobases. Primer synthesis for lagging strand synthesis is catalyzed by additional gene 4 protein molecules that undergo multiple association/dissociation steps to catalyze multiple rounds of primer synthesis. The smaller molecular weight form of gene 4 protein has been purified from an equimolar mixture of both forms. Removal of the large form results in the loss of primase activity but not of helicase activity. Submolar amounts of the large form present in a mixture of both forms are sufficient to restore high specific activity of primase characteristic of an equimolar mixture of both forms. These results suggest that the gene 4 primase is an oligomer which is composed of both molecular weight forms. The large form may be the distributive component of the primase which dissociates from the template after each round of primer synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1525660262,"By screening lambda gt11 cDNA expression libraries prepared from poly(A+) RNA of illuminated (4 and 16 h) spinach seedlings (Spinacia oleracea var. Monatol), we have recovered phage containing inserts corresponding to the complete precursor polypeptide associated with the water oxidizing photosystem II. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence indicates a polypeptide of 140 amino acid residues (15.0 kDa). The mature protein is predicted to consist of 99 amino acid residues (10.8 kDa). The identity of the recombinant DNAs was established serologically and by determining an N-terminal sequence of 25 amino acid residues from the purified authentic protein. This sequence was found in the cDNA-derived amino acid sequence. In addition, a monospecific antiserum detected the appropriate polypeptides when copy-RNA was translated into protein which was imported into isolated unbroken chloroplasts. The transit sequence (41 amino acid residues; 4.2 kDa) is markedly dissimilar to those of the three extrinsic, luminal photosystem II proteins. Secondary structure prediction suggests a transmembrane arrangement of the 10-kDa polypeptide in the thylakoid membrane, with the N terminus in the thylakoid lumen and a 17-amino acid C-terminal sequence at the outside partitions. This is consistent with biochemical and functional data for the protein. A major transcript of 1.0 kilobases has been observed in polyadenylated RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1503165233,"The steady-state levels of mRNAs coding for two components of basement membranes, the alpha 1 chain of type IV collagen and the B1 chain of laminin, were measured in the kidneys of male CDF rats following the induction of diabetes with streptozotocin for periods of between 2 days and 28 weeks. The concentration of mRNA for the alpha 1 chain of type IV collagen/microgram of RNA decreased markedly with age in control and diabetic rats. The diabetic level was significantly lower than control after 2 and 11 weeks of diabetes. After 28 weeks, however, there was no significant difference from the levels in control animals. Treatment of control and diabetic rats with the aldose reductase inhibitor Statil (350 mg/kg diet) did not affect the levels of the mRNA for the alpha 1 chain of type IV collagen. In contrast to the continuous decline in the concentration of mRNA for the alpha 1 chain of type IV collagen, the level of mRNA for the B1 chain of laminin increased two-fold between 11 and 28 weeks after induction of diabetes. This increase occurred as aging of control rats reduced the level of laminin B1 mRNA by approximately 50%. Treatment with Statil had no effect on laminin B1 mRNA levels. In control rats there was no change in the ratio of the levels of mRNAs for laminin B1: alpha 1 (IV) collagen with age. The mean ratio was 0.97 +/- 0.10 at 19 weeks and 1.0 +/- 0.10 at 36 weeks of age. In diabetic rats there was a marked increase in the ratio from 0.85 +/- 0.11 at 19 weeks to 3.2 +/- 1.2 at 36 weeks of age. The increased abundance of mRNA for laminin B1 raises the possibility that increased synthesis of laminin contributes to the thickening and abnormal function of renal basement membranes in streptozotocin-diabetic rats."
https://openalex.org/W194357779,"Intracellular free Ca2+ [( Ca2+]i) and pH (pHi) were measured simultaneously by dual wavelength excitation in thrombin-stimulated human platelets double-labeled with the fluorescent probes fura2 and 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein to determine the relationship between changes in [Ca2+]i and pHi, respectively. At 37 degrees C, thrombin (0.5 or 0.1 units/ml) increased [Ca2+]i with no detectable lag period to maximum levels within 13 s followed by a slow return to resting levels. There was a transient decrease in pHi within 9 s that was immediately followed by an alkalinization response, attributable to activation of Na+/H+ exchange, that raised pHi above resting levels within 22 s. At 10-15 degrees C, thrombin-induced changes in [Ca2+]i and pHi were delayed and therefore better resolved, although no differences in the magnitude of changes in [Ca2+]i and pHi were observed. However, the increase in [Ca2+]i had peaked or was declining before the alkalinization response was detected, suggesting that Ca2+ mobilization occurs before activation of Na+/H+ exchange. In platelets preincubated with 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride or gel-filtered in Na+-free buffer (Na+ replaced with N-methyl-D-glutamine) to inhibit Na+/H+ exchange, thrombin stimulation caused a rapid, sustained decrease in pHi. Under these conditions there was complete inhibition of the alkalinization response, whereas Ca2+ mobilization was only partially inhibited. Nigericin (a K+/H+ ionophore) caused a rapid acidification of more than 0.3 pH unit that was sustained in the presence of 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride. Subsequent stimulation with thrombin resulted in slight inhibition of Ca2+ mobilization. These data show that, in human platelets stimulated with high or low concentrations of thrombin, Ca2+ mobilization can occur without a functional Na+/H+ exchanger and in an acidified cytoplasm. We conclude that Ca2+ mobilization does not require activation of Na+/H+ exchange or preliminary cytoplasmic alkalinization."

One equivalent of formate is produced per equivalent of alpha-keto-gamma-methylthiobutyrate and two equivalents of formate per equivalent of methylthiopropionate. Two compounds were identified as intermediates in this reaction sequence: 1-phospho-5-S-methylthioribulose (1-PMT-ribulose) and 1-phospho-2,3-diketo-5-S-methylpentane. The enzyme, 1-PMTR isomerase, which converts 1-PMTR to 1-PMT-ribulose was highly purified. In addition, a protein fraction was isolated which converts 1-PMT-ribulose to the phosphodiketone. A second protein fraction was isolated that converts the phosphodiketone to an intermediate which has not been isolated so far. This intermediate is oxidatively converted to alpha-keto-gamma-methylthiobutyrate and S-methylthiopropionate by a third protein fraction. Methylthiopropionate is not derived from free alpha-keto-gamma-methylthiobutyrate."
https://openalex.org/W176263485,"Studies are reported on the characterization of a new isolate within a novel class of variants of the L1210 cell exhibiting markedly increased transport inward of folate analogues. This variant (L1210/R83), which was selected in the presence of the antifolate metoprine, exhibited a 40-fold increase in [3H]aminopterin influx compared to parental cells and a modest (4-5-fold) increase in [3H]aminopterin efflux. The increase in influx was associated with a comparable increase in influx Vmax for the one-carbon, reduced folate transport system and the same increase in the amount of specific binding of [3H]aminopterin on the cell surface. Values for influx Km for [3H]aminopterin and specificity for various folate structures were unchanged. The alteration in influx Vmax and more rapid efflux accounted for the different level of intracellular exchangeable level of drug at steady state in this variant compared with parental L1210 cells. Otherwise, membrane potential was unchanged. The N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of [3H]aminopterin was used to covalently label the specific binding protein for folate compounds in the plasma membrane of variant and parental L1210 cells. Incorporation of label into this protein was stable under a variety of conditions and accounted for 97 and 52% of total cellular labeling, respectively, for membrane derived from R83 and parental L1210 cells at a reagent concentration of 20 nM. Specific affinity labeling on the surface of parental and variant cells was decreased in the presence of aminopterin, methotrexate, or 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, but not in the presence of folic acid. Also, [3H]aminopterin influx in these cells was inhibited by the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of aminopterin or methotrexate, but not the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of folic acid. These findings, in addition to the increased affinity labeling of this variant, which corresponds to the increase in influx of [3H] aminopterin also seen, appears to identify the affinity labeled protein as a component of the classical one-carbon, reduced folate transport system in these cells. The affinity labeled protein from each cell type was solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate or extracted in detergent in the presence of proteinase inhibitors and was found to elute from Sephacryl S-300 and migrate during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a single peak of Mr = 45,000-48,000. Recovery of labeled binding protein in these fractions from R83 variant cells was approximately 40 times greater than that from parental cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W1561143098,"The photoaffinity ligand for the Ah receptor, [125I]-2-azido-3-iodo-7,8-dibromodibenzo-p-dioxin, previously has been shown to selectively label two peptides in the cytosol fraction of C57BL/6J mouse liver: a 95-kDa peptide, the ligand binding moiety of the Ah receptor, and a 70-kDa proteolytic fragment formed from the larger peptide (Poland, A., Glover, E., Ebetino, F. H., and Kende, A.S. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 6352-6365). These two peptides were partially purified to an approximately 20,000-fold enrichment with a 15-20% yield by the following scheme: 1) photoaffinity labeling of the 35-55% ammonium sulfate fraction of liver cytosol; 2) chromatography on polyethyleneimine-Sepharose coupled at low charge density and heparin/Mn2+ precipitation of the dilute column eluate; 3) DEAE-Sepharose chromatography to remove heparin; 4) chromatography on heparin-Sepharose; 5) preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis followed by electroelution of the protein and ion pair extraction to remove sodium dodecyl sulfate; and 6) high performance liquid chromatography on a reverse-phase C-4 column. Following initial chromatography on polyethyleneimine Sepharose, it was found that substantial subsequent purification could only be achieved under denaturing conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2084843864,"We have demonstrated genetic transposition in human cells. An experimental system was established in which the Ecogpt (gpt) gene was employed as a target for inactivation. The human lung carcinoma cell line A549 containing this target was fused to UV irradiated A549 cells that did not contain the target. From the fusion products, sublines carrying an inactivated gpt gene were analyzed. UV irradiation increased the frequency of inactivated gpt genes in the fusion cells by 100-fold. One subline was found to contain a complete Alu sequence in the coding region of the gpt gene. The inserted element differed from the Blur8 sequence by only 7 out of the 270 nucleotides. The insertion of this Alu element created a 5 by insertion site duplication."
https://openalex.org/W2125796209,"The mechanism of melibiose symport by the melibiose permease of Escherichia coli was investigated by further analyzing the Na+ (H+ or Li+)-coupled facilitated diffusion reactions catalyzed by the carrier in de-energized membrane vesicles, with particular emphasis on the reaction of sugar exchange at equilibrium. It is first shown that melibiose exchange at equilibrium proceeds without concomitant movement of Na+, i.e. the coupled cation is kinetically occluded during the melibiose exchange reaction. These results provide further experimental support for the model of Na+ sugar co-transport of the physiological substrate melibiose previously suggested (Bassilana, M., Pourcher, T., and Leblanc, G. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16865-16870) in which: 1) the mechanisms of co-substrate binding to (or release from) the carrier are ordered processes on both the outer (Na+ first, sugar last) and inner membrane surfaces (sugar first, Na+ last) and give rise to a mirror-type model; 2) release of Na+ from the carrier on the inner membrane surface is very slow and rate-limiting for carrier cycling but is fast on the opposite side, contributing to the asymmetrical functioning of the permease. On the other hand, analysis of the exchange of identical sugars (homologous exchange) and different sugar analogs (heterologous exchange) indicates that the overall rate of sugar exchange reaction coupled to Na+ or Li+ is limited by the rate of one (or more) partial step(s) associated with the inflow of co-substrates and most probably by the rate of sugar release into the intravesicular medium. It is proposed that the variability of the facilitated diffusion reactions catalyzed by the carrier in the presence of different coupled cations and/or sugar analogs reflects variations in the rate of co-substrate release from the carrier on the inner membrane surface."
https://openalex.org/W1495618609,"The in vitro replication of adenovirus (Ad) DNA covalently attached to the 55-kDa terminal protein requires at least five proteins including the 80-kDa preterminal protein, the Ad DNA polymerase, the Ad DNA binding protein, nuclear factor I, and topoisomerase I. The replication of Ad DNA templates devoid of the terminal protein requires an additional protein, designated factor pL, which has been purified from uninfected HeLa cell nuclei (Guggenheimer, R. A., Nagata, K., Kenny, M., and Hurwitz, J. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 7815-7825). Factor pL has been found to contain an intrinsic 5'----3' exonuclease activity. When Ad DNA templates lacking the terminal protein were pretreated with factor pL, the requirement for factor pL in the replication reaction was abolished. Synthetic partially duplex oligonucleotide templates containing Ad origin sequences were constructed in order to determine the structure of the DNA molecules that are active in the absence of factor pL. These experiments indicated that factor pL degrades the 5'-end of the nontemplate (displaced) strand of the Ad origin thereby creating a single-stranded region at the 3'-end of the template strand. Such DNAs are competent for initiation of Ad DNA replication in the absence of factor pL but remain dependent on nuclear factor 1."
https://openalex.org/W2461079806,"Seventy lung tumors from 53 patients were analysed for alterations of myc family oncogenes, c-myc, N-myc and L-myc, to evaluate when activation of these genes occurs during tumor development. The 53 cases were 17 small cell carcinomas (SCCs), 18 adenocarcinomas, 12 squamous cell carcinomas (SqCs), 4 large cell carcinomas and 2 adenosquamous carcinomas. Either N-myc or L-myc was amplified in 4 of the 17 (one N-myc and 3 L-myc) SCCs (24%), while c-myc was amplified in 3 of the 12 SqCs (25%). In one SCC, amplification of N-myc was found in the primary tumor, a pulmonary hilar lymph node metastasis and a pleural metastasis, but not in a liver metastasis or a para-aortic lymph node metastasis. In one SqC, c-myc was amplified in a pleural metastasis and a lymph node metastasis, but not in the primary tumor. In 2 cases of SCCs, amplification or rearrangement of c-myc was detected only in the cell lines, but not in the original tumors taken from the same individuals. These results indicate that tumor cells were heterogeneous for amplification and rearrangement of myc family oncogenes, and suggest that activation of these oncogenes in SCCs and SqCs occurs not at the time of malignant transformation but during tumor progression."

https://openalex.org/W1530383120,"We have isolated a new benzo(a)pyrene-resistant clone, c35, of the mouse hepatoma line, Hepa-1. Cytochrome P1-450 mRNA and P1-450-dependent aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity are no longer inducible by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin in c35. The phenotype of c35 is unstable in long-term culture. A subclone, c35-1, having partially restored AHH inducibility, was studied in detail. The concentration of dioxin required to give half-maximal induction of AHH activity was 16-fold greater in c35-1 than in Hepa-1. Scatchard analysis showed that c35-1 contains reduced levels of the Ah (dioxin) receptor, which mediates induction of P1-450, but that the affinity of the receptor for dioxin is unaltered. In vivo assays confirmed that c35-1 possesses reduced levels of receptor but showed that it is even more severely affected in nuclear translocation of the receptor. Somatic cell hybridization experiments demonstrated that c35 is recessive and belongs to a new, third complementation group of mutants defective in Ah receptor activity. We propose that c35 is mutated either in the ligand-binding Ah receptor polypeptide or in another polypeptide required for receptor function and that in c35-1 partial reversion has occurred to generate a polypeptide which is still impaired in its role in promoting nuclear translocation and/or DNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W24624685,"Mutations in the nusB gene of Escherichia coli block transcriptional antitermination mediated by the N gene protein of bacteriophage lambda. We describe here two methods of overproducing the NusB protein in E. coli and a method of purifying NusB to apparent homogeneity on a large scale. Purified NusB directly stimulates transcriptional antitermination by the lambda N protein in vitro. It behaves as a monomer (Mr = 15,689) during gel permeation chromatography and gradient sedimentation. The number of NusB molecules in a wild type E. coli K12 cell ranges from about 3,000 to about 6,000 molecules/cell, depending on the growth medium, and is about 50-80% of the number of molecules of the core component of RNA polymerase in the cell. This implies that NusB has a major role in regulating chain elongation during the transcription of E. coli genes. Many E. coli strains with nusB mutations cannot grow at low temperature. However, a sup+ strain with the suppressible amber mutation nusBam115 can grow at 42 degrees C. Since such a strain does not produce NusB protein detectable by immunoprecipitation with anti-NusB, normal amounts of NusB are not essential for the survival of E. coli at 42 degrees C."

Biol. 6, 525-529), while in eukaryotes it is added post-transcriptionally by a special tRNA guanylyl transferase (Cooley, L., Appel, B., and Soll, D. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 6475-6479). Here we show that the additional G of chloroplast tRNAHis species is gene-encoded and retained in the tRNA by a processing step analogous to the prokaryotic one. However, the structural requirements for recognition by the different RNase P activities are not the same."
https://openalex.org/W2120687419,"Three phosphorylated reaction intermediates (EP) of Na,K-ATPase, and ADP-sensitive K+-insensitive EP (E1P), an ADP- and K+-sensitive EP (E*P), and a K+-sensitive ADP-insensitive EP (E2P), have been discovered at present. By using Na,K-ATPase proteoliposomes (PL) prepared from the electric eel enzyme, we found in this study that E*P existed even in the presence of K+ on both sides of the PL and that there was a sidedness difference in K+ sites between E*P and E2P. Cytoplasmic K+ (K+cyt) accelerated the conversion of E*P to E2P but did not dephosphorylate the E2P. Although the extracellular K+ accelerated the dephosphorylation of E2P, it did not interact with E*P directly. This K+cyt effect was also verified by the activation of Na+-pump in the Na+-K+ exchange mode. In the presence of K+cyt, both the ATP hydrolysis and Na+ uptake rates of the PL containing K+ inside vesicles increased sigmoidally with the concentrations of ATP and cytoplasmic Na+ (Na+cyt). However, in the absence of K+cyt, these Na+-pump reactions in PL containing K+ inside vesicles had only a hyperbolic curve. These results imply that the E*P to E2P conversion is one of the rate-limiting steps of the Na+-pump in the presence of a high concentration of ATP and that K+cyt may control this reaction step by enhancing the conversion rate of E*P to E2P."

Incubation of human thymocytes in the presence of the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate increased the levels of the mRNAs of TcR-alpha and -delta while the levels of TcR-beta and -gamma mRNA were not affected. cAMP, on the other hand, caused a decrease in TcR-alpha and -delta mRNA levels but also did not affect TcR-beta and -gamma mRNA levels. The induction of TcR-alpha and -delta mRNA by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate occurred at the transcriptional level only whereas cAMP treatment decreased both TcR-alpha gene transcription and the stability of its mRNA. The similarity in the transcriptional control of TcR-alpha and -delta genes combined with their close chromosomal location raises the possibility that they share common DNA regulatory elements."
