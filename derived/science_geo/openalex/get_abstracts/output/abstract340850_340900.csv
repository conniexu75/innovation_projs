https://openalex.org/W2064797253,"The chemical analysis of the waste water from plants that manufacture chemicals is a nonintrusive method for confirming a suspected violation of the prohibition against the production of chemical warfare agents. The chemical structure of most nerve gases is related to that of methylphosphonic acid, whereas most organo-phosphorus pesticides have the phosphoric acid structure. On the basis of this characteristic difference, a procedure has been developed in which the presence of a nerve gas, its decomposition products, or its starting materials in waste water (Rhine River and Meuse River water) is reflected by the appearance of methylphosphonic acid as a breakdown product after hydrolysis. This acid is concentrated and converted into a volatile compound by methylation. After cleanup, the ester may be separated from related compounds by gas chromatography and is detected by means of a specific detector for phosphorus. The detection limit of nerve gases by this procedure is approximately 1 nanomole per liter of water. The scope and limitations of the method are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2018855730,A new interpretation of late Pleistocene sea levels on the U.S. Atlantic continental shelf is based on in-place lagoonal and salt-marsh sediments obtained from vibra-cores. These data show sea levels during the last Wisconsinan transgression were about 30 meters shallower than is indicated by existing sea-level curves.
https://openalex.org/W2093238928,"Both laboratory and in situ studies indicate that the nitrogen-fixing blue-green nuisance algae Anabaena spp. have developed adaptive means of dominating surface lake waters. During the dramatic diurnal shifts in surface light intensity and oxygen saturation accompanying blooms, Anabaena can overcome oxygen toxicity by sequential optimization of carbon dioxide and nitrogen fixation and by pigment alteration. These mechanisms allow optimal utilization of the radiant energy while minimizing competition for photoreductant between two main energy-demanding processes."
https://openalex.org/W2028327291,Exceptionally high contents of chromium and nickel in shales from the early Precambrian Fig Tree series of South Africa (> 3.1 × 109 years old) suggest that the ancient crustal rocks from which these sediments were derived were ultramafic in composition.
https://openalex.org/W2059252466,"An x-ray survey of the Virgo region revealed signals from the directions of 3C 273 and M 87. Three other x-ray sources appear in the region scanned, but do not fit any known radio sources. The x-ray flux (1 to 10 angstroms) from the direction of 3C 273 is about 1000 times weaker than from the strongest x-ray source, Sco XR-1. If the source is located at the cosmological distance of 500 megaparsecs, the x-ray luminosity is 7.3 x 10(45) ergs per second. The x-ray luminosity of M87 is 1.5 x 10(43) ergs per second."
https://openalex.org/W2063946748,"A modified form of a model proposed by Gerling and Shukolyukow is used to study the development of lead isotopic ratios in oceanic basalts. This modified model yields an age for the earth which is calculated to be 4530 +/- 40 million years. The significance of this calculation is that it is independent of the knowledge of the ages of the samples studied. It is also found that although the source of the basalts is not generally homogeneous, the differentiation of this source from a closed system has occurred fairly recently geologically. The oldest time for the differentiation, 1230 +/- 350 million years ago, has been found for Mid-Atlantic tholeiites."

https://openalex.org/W2087302110,"The Galápagos mounds sea-floor hydrothermal system is at least 300,000 years old and once produced manganese-poor sediments, which nearly blanketed the area of the present mounds field. Present-day mound deposits are limited manganese-rich exposures, suggesting that the system has changed from rock-to water-dominated and has diminished in intensity with time."
https://openalex.org/W1993547136,"Ahn et al . ([1][1]), in describing the experimental search of a database realized with Rydberg atoms, left the misleading impression that the search constituted quantum computation. Their atomic system, in the words of the accompanying Perspective, “can implement [quantum] algorithms” ([2][2])"
https://openalex.org/W2048932990,SOLTRAN is a flexible computer model for the direct solar beam intensity spectrum at the earth's surface. It has been derived by combining the extra-terrestrial solar spectrum with the atmospheric transmittance spectrum. Application of SOLTRAN to the calculation of the potential efficiency of photovoltaic cells demonstrates the effect of atmospheric absorption bands. These bands prevent unequivocal assignment of optimum energy gap values.
https://openalex.org/W2012410139,The electrical polarity of ice crystals produced from a super-cooled cloud is temperature-dependent. The charge polarity appears to be associated with the crystal habit. This phenomenon may be important in precipitation and cloud electrification processes.
https://openalex.org/W2060918022,"Indium concentrations have been determined by neutron activation in four members of each of the L3, L4, L5, and L6 chondritic meteorite classes. The range of concentrations is found to be from 0.14 to 22 parts per billion, with the highest values in L3 chondrites and the lowest values in the L5 and L6 classes. Plots of indium concentration versus relative mean deviation of pyroxene iron content, total carbon concentration, and primordial argon-36 concentration show positive correlations to varying degrees. Indium concentration appears to be a valuable parameter relating to variable formation conditions of the chondritic meteorites during the early history of the solar system."

Now a federal proposal to prevent them by paying loggers to cut smaller trees is generating heat among ecologists, who say the approach may not be right for all forests--or all fires."
https://openalex.org/W2137539142,"Supermassive black holes (BHs) have long been implicated in explaining active galactic nuclei such as quasars. In his Perspective, Kormendy discusses recent work that suggests a larger role for these objects. The Hubble Space Telescope has provided many new detections of BHs, and these new results indicate that they play an important role in the galaxy formation processes."
https://openalex.org/W2013731652,The types of radioactive waste disposal sites available are outlined. The use of salt deposits and their advantages are discussed. The reasons for the selection of the present site for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant are presented. The possibilities of using salt domes along the Gulf Coast and not-salt rocks as nuclear waste repositories are also discussed. The sea bed characteristics are described and advantages of this type of site selection are presented.

https://openalex.org/W1505100491,"A new series of rapid-fire photographs has finally captured the expected dance of atoms in the changing latticework of a quasicrystal, the slightly unpredictable cousin of crystals. Although scientists had observed defects in quasicrystalline structures left behind by the flip-flops, called phasons, this is the first time anyone has spotted a real phason in action."

https://openalex.org/W1496427128,"A physicist has used the laws of thermodynamics, information, relativity, and quantum mechanics to figure out the ultimate physical limits on the speed of a computer. His calculations show that, in principle, a kilogram of matter in a liter-sized container could be an ""ultimate laptop"" more than a trillion trillion trillion times as powerful as today's fastest supercomputer--if it could be turned into a black hole."

He earned his B.S. from Cornell University and his Ph.D. in statistics from the University of Chicago. He has taught statistics and mathematics at the University of Chicago and Williams College. His research interests include applying statistics to paleobiology, endocrine diseases, and image recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1506644461,"Two National Research Council panels have released new reports on improving science and math education in the United States. One panel says that the best way to improve teacher education is to make it a continuum, with school districts taking more responsibility for the initial preparation of new teachers and university faculty playing a bigger role in ongoing professional development. The other panel says that more recent science Ph.D.s would be willing to teach high school science and math if the government helped with the transition, if the certification process were compressed, and if they could retain ties to research."
https://openalex.org/W1537942618,"Mudstones are an important source of hydrocarbons that migrate into petroleum deposits, and they can reveal much about Earth's history--if they are read correctly. Now a team of geologists has found that a telling feature of many mudstones may have been misinterpreted, throwing into question conclusions about everything from climate to ocean currents."
https://openalex.org/W1541466239,"A new finding, based on x-rays from distant neutron stars, could be the first clear evidence of a weird relativistic effect called frame dragging, in which a heavy chunk of spinning matter wrenches the space-time around it like an eggbeater. Using data from NASA's Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, three astronomers in Amsterdam found circumstantial evidence for frame dragging in the flickering of three neutron stars in binary systems. They announced their results in the 1 September issue of The Astrophysical Journal."
