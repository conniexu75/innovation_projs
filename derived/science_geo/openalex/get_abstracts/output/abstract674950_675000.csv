https://openalex.org/W3164692211,"The simultaneous measurement of multiple modalities represents an exciting frontier for single-cell genomics and necessitates computational methods that can define cellular states based on multimodal data. Here, we introduce ""weighted-nearest neighbor"" analysis, an unsupervised framework to learn the relative utility of each data type in each cell, enabling an integrative analysis of multiple modalities. We apply our procedure to a CITE-seq dataset of 211,000 human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with panels extending to 228 antibodies to construct a multimodal reference atlas of the circulating immune system. Multimodal analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states, allowing us to identify and validate previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets and to interpret immune responses to vaccination and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our approach represents a broadly applicable strategy to analyze single-cell multimodal datasets and to look beyond the transcriptome toward a unified and multimodal definition of cellular identity."
https://openalex.org/W3165293978,"Background As a result of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there have been widespread changes in healthcare access. We conducted a retrospective population-based study in Alberta, Canada (population 4.4 million), where there have been approximately 1550 hospital admissions for COVID-19, to determine the impact of COVID-19 on hospital admissions and emergency department (ED visits), following initiation of a public health emergency act on March 15, 2020. Methods We used multivariable negative binomial regression models to compare daily numbers of medical/surgical hospital admissions via the ED between March 16-September 23, 2019 (pre COVID-19) and March 16-September 23, 2020 (post COVID-19 public health measures). We compared the most frequent diagnoses for hospital admissions pre/post COVID-19 public health measures. A similar analysis was completed for numbers of daily ED visits for any reason with a particular focus on ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC). Findings There was a significant reduction in both daily medical (incident rate ratio (IRR) 0.86, p&lt;0.001) and surgical (IRR 0.82, p&lt;0.001) admissions through the ED in Alberta post COVID-19 public health measures. There was a significant decline in daily ED visits (IRR 0.65, p&lt;0.001) including ACSC (IRR 0.75, p&lt;0.001). The most common medical/surgical diagnoses for hospital admissions did not vary substantially pre and post COVID-19 public health measures, though there was a significant reduction in admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a significant increase in admissions for mental and behavioral disorders due to use of alcohol. Conclusions Despite a relatively low volume of COVID-19 hospital admissions in Alberta, there was an extensive impact on our healthcare system with fewer admissions to hospital and ED visits. This work generates hypotheses around causes for reduced hospital admissions and ED visits which warrant further investigation. As most publicly funded health systems struggle with health-system capacity routinely, understanding how these reductions can be safely sustained will be critical."
https://openalex.org/W3165833165,"Considerable evidence from U.S. studies suggests that weight stigma is consequential for patient-provider interactions and healthcare for people with high body weight. Despite international calls for efforts to reduce weight stigma in the medical community, cross-country research is lacking in this field. This study provides the first multinational investigation of associations between weight stigma and healthcare experiences across six Western countries.Participants were 13,996 adults residing in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the UK, and the US who were actively enrolled in an internationally available behavioral weight management program. Participants completed identical online surveys in the dominant language for their country that assessed experienced weight stigma, internalized weight bias, and healthcare behaviors and experiences including perceived quality of care, avoidance or delay of seeking care, experiences with providers, and perceived weight stigma from doctors.Among participants who reported a history of weight stigma (56-61%), two-thirds of participants in each country reported experiencing weight stigma from doctors. Across all six countries, after accounting for demographics, BMI, and experienced stigma, participants with higher internalized weight bias reported greater healthcare avoidance, increased perceived judgment from doctors due to body weight, lower frequency of obtaining routine checkups, less frequent listening and respect from providers, and lower quality of healthcare. Additionally, experienced weight stigma (from any source) was indirectly associated with poorer healthcare experiences through weight bias internalization, consistently across the six countries.Weight stigma in healthcare is prevalent among adults actively engaged in weight management across different Western countries, and internalized weight bias has negative implications for healthcare even after controlling for BMI. The similar findings across all six countries underscore the negative consequences of weight stigma on healthcare behaviors and experiences, and emphasize the need for collective international efforts to address this problem."
https://openalex.org/W3165732305,"To control viral infection, vertebrates rely on both inducible interferon responses and less well-characterized cell-intrinsic responses composed of “at the ready” antiviral effector proteins. Here, we show that E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM7 is a cell-intrinsic antiviral effector that restricts multiple human enteroviruses by targeting viral 2BC, a membrane remodeling protein, for ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. Selective pressure exerted by TRIM7 results in emergence of a TRIM7-resistant coxsackievirus with a single point mutation in the viral 2C ATPase/helicase. In cultured cells, the mutation helps the virus evade TRIM7 but impairs optimal viral replication, and this correlates with a hyperactive and structurally plastic 2C ATPase. Unexpectedly, the TRIM7-resistant virus has a replication advantage in mice and causes lethal pancreatitis. These findings reveal a unique mechanism for targeting enterovirus replication and provide molecular insight into the benefits and trade-offs of viral evolution imposed by a host restriction factor."
https://openalex.org/W3165814101,"Background Mexican state governments’ actions are essential to control the COVID-19 pandemic within the country. However, the type, rigor and pace of implementation of public policies have varied considerably between states. Little is known about the subnational (state) variation policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. Material and methods We collected daily information on public policies designed to inform the public, as well as to promote distancing, and mask use. The policies analyzed were: School Closure, Workplace Closure, Cancellation of Public Events, Restrictions on Gatherings, Stay at Home Order, Public Transit Suspensions, Information Campaigns, Internal Travel Controls, International Travel Controls, Use of Face Masks We use these data to create a composite index to evaluate the adoption of these policies in the 32 states. We then assess the timeliness and rigor of the policies across the country, from the date of the first case, February 27, 2020. Results The national average in the index during the 143 days of the pandemic was 41.1 out of a possible 100 points on our index. Nuevo León achieved the highest performance (50.4); San Luis Potosí the lowest (34.1). The differential between the highest versus the lowest performance was 47.4%. Conclusions The study identifies variability and heterogeneity in how and when Mexican states implemented policies to contain COVID-19. We demonstrate the absence of a uniform national response and widely varying stringency of state responses. We also show how these responses are not based on testing and do not reflect the local burden of disease. National health system stewardship and a coordinated, timely, rigorous response to the pandemic did not occur in Mexico but is desirable to contain COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3165730824,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with a very high mortality and an increased risk for progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a model for AKI, which results in tubular damage, dysfunction of the mitochondria and autophagy, and in decreased cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) with progressing fibrosis resulting in CKD. NAD+ is a co-enzyme for several proteins, including the NAD+ dependent sirtuins. NAD+ augmentation, e.g. by use of its precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR), improves mitochondrial homeostasis and organismal metabolism in many species. In the present investigation the effects of prophylactic administration of NR on IRI-induced AKI were studied in the rat. Bilateral IRI reduced kidney tissue NAD+, caused tubular damage, reduced α-Klotho (klotho), and altered autophagy flux. AKI initiated progression to CKD, as shown by induced profibrotic Periostin (postn) and Inhibin subunit beta-A, (activin A / Inhba), both 24 hours and 14 days after surgery. NR restored tissue NAD+ to that of the sham group, increased autophagy (reduced p62) and sirtuin1 (Sirt1) but did not ameliorate renal tubular damage and profibrotic genes in the 24 hours and 14 days IRI models. AKI induced NAD+ depletion and impaired autophagy, while augmentation of NAD+ by NR restored tissue NAD+ and increased autophagy, possibly serving as a protective response. However, prophylactic administration of NR did not ameliorate tubular damage of the IRI rats nor rescued the initiation of fibrosis in the long-term AKI to CKD model, which is a pivotal event in CKD pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3164258354,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated, over the recent years, impressive clinical response in cancer patients, but some patients do not respond at all to checkpoint blockade, exhibiting primary resistance. Primary resistance to PD-1 blockade is reported to occur under conditions of immunosuppressive tumor environment, a condition caused by myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and by T cells exclusion, due to increased level of T regulatory cells (Tregs). Since TGF- β activates Tregs, TGF- β inhibitor may overcome primary resistance to anti-PD-1. Indeed, recent mice experiments show that combining anti-PD-1 with anti-TGF- β yields significant therapeutic improvements compared to anti-TGF- β alone. The present paper introduces two cancer-specific parameters and, correspondingly, develops a mathematical model which explains how primary resistance to PD-1 blockade occurs, in terms of the two cancer-specific parameters, and how, in combination with anti-TGF- β , anti-PD-1 provides significant benefits. The model is represented by a system of partial differential equations and the simulations are in agreement with the recent mice experiments. In some cancer patients, treatment with anti-PD-1 results in rapid progression of the disease, known as hyperprogression disease (HPD). The mathematical model can also explain how this situation arises, and it predicts that HPD may be reversed by combining anti-TGF- β to anti-PD-1. The model is used to demonstrate how the two cancer-specific parameters may serve as biomarkers in predicting the efficacy of combination therapy with PD-1 and TGF- β inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W3165020050,"In Western societies, the stereotype prevails that pink is for girls and blue is for boys. A third possible gendered colour is red. While liked by women, it represents power, stereotypically a masculine characteristic. Empirical studies confirmed such gendered connotations when testing colour-emotion associations or colour preferences in males and females. Furthermore, empirical studies demonstrated that pink is a positive colour, blue is mainly a positive colour, and red is both a positive and a negative colour. Here, we assessed if the same valence and gender connotations appear in widely available written texts (Wikipedia and newswire articles). Using a word embedding method (GloVe), we extracted gender and valence biases for blue, pink, and red, as well as for the remaining basic colour terms from a large English-language corpus containing six billion words. We found and confirmed that pink was biased towards femininity and positivity, and blue was biased towards positivity. We found no strong gender bias for blue, and no strong gender or valence biases for red. For the remaining colour terms, we only found that green, white, and brown were positively biased. Our finding on pink shows that writers of widely available English texts use this colour term to convey femininity. This gendered communication reinforces the notion that results from research studies find their analogue in real word phenomena. Other findings were either consistent or inconsistent with results from research studies. We argue that widely available written texts have biases on their own, because they have been filtered according to context, time, and what is appropriate to be reported."
https://openalex.org/W3165835544,"Collaborative, One Health approaches support governments to effectively prevent, detect and respond to emerging health challenges, such as zoonotic diseases, that arise at the human-animal-environmental interfaces. To overcome these challenges, operational and outcome-oriented tools that enable animal health and human health services to work specifically on their collaboration are required. While international capacity and assessment frameworks such as the IHR-MEF (International Health Regulations—Monitoring and Evaluation Framework) and the OIE PVS (Performance of Veterinary Services) Pathway exist, a tool and process that could assess and strengthen the interactions between human and animal health sectors was needed. Through a series of six phased pilots, the IHR-PVS National Bridging Workshop (NBW) method was developed and refined. The NBW process gathers human and animal health stakeholders and follows seven sessions, scheduled across three days. The outputs from each session build towards the next one, following a structured process that goes from gap identification to joint planning of corrective measures. The NBW process allows human and animal health sector representatives to jointly identify actions that support collaboration while advancing evaluation goals identified through the IHR-MEF and the OIE PVS Pathway. By integrating sector-specific and collaborative goals, the NBWs help countries in creating a realistic, concrete and practical joint road map for enhanced compliance to international standards as well as strengthened preparedness and response for health security at the human-animal interface."
https://openalex.org/W3164226984,"As countries are lifting restrictions and resuming international travels, the rising risk of COVID-19 importation remains concerning, given that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could be transmitted unintentionally through the global transportation network. To explore and assess the effective strategies for curtailing the epidemic risk from international importation nationwide, we evaluated “the joint prevention and control” mechanism, which made up of 19 containment policies, on how it impacted the change of medical observation and detection time from border arrival to laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 in its burst in China. Based on 1,314 epidemiological-survey cases from February 29 to May 25, 2020, we found that the synchronized approach of implementing multi-dimensional interventional policies, such as a centralized quarantine and nucleic acid testing (NAT), flight service adjustment and border closure, effectively facilitate early identification of infected case. Specifically, the implementation of the international flight service reduction was found to be associated with a reduction of the mean intervals of diagnosis from arrival to lab-confirmation by 0.44 days maximally, and the border closure was associated with a reduction of the diagnosis interval of imported cases by 0.69 days, from arrival to laboratory confirmation. The study suggests that a timely and synchronized implementation of multi-dimensional policies is compelling in preventing domestic spreading from importation."
https://openalex.org/W3164337646,"An understanding of the effects of fishing on marine ecosystems relies on information about the conserved state of these environments. Non-conventional approaches such as the use of historical data and local ecological knowledge can provide information and help adjust our references of changes in the environment. Also, the combination of different types of data can indicate a fisheries trend that would be undetectable when evaluated separately. Here we investigated changes in fisher's perceptions regarding overexploited and new target species in artisanal fisheries in a secular fishing village of the subtropical, southeastern Brazilian coast. We identified temporal changes in landings and in the mean trophic level (MTL) of high trophic level species (≥ 3.5 and >4) over 16 years. Fishers' knowledge revealed shifts in perception associated with years of fishing practice. More experienced fishers recognized a greater number of overexploited and new target species than fishers in the beginning of their careers. Landing data has revealed declining trends of 72% for five mesopredators species. Due to the overfishing of mesopredators, there was a shift in target species, towards fish that were previously discarded. Temporal changes in landings and in the MTL metric are concordant with previous reports on the overexploitation of species caught by local fishers. Our work reveals that multiple sources of information can be combined to establish historical baselines and improve the detection of change in marine ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W3165380685,"The spine is the first site for incidence of bone metastasis. Thus, the vertebrae have a high potential risk of being weakened by metastatic tissues. The evaluation of strength of the bone affected by the presence of metastases is fundamental to assess the fracture risk. This work proposes a robust method to evaluate the variations of strain distributions due to artificial lesions within the vertebral body, based on in situ mechanical testing and digital volume correlation. Five porcine vertebrae were tested in compression up to 6500N inside a micro computed tomography scanner. For each specimen, images were acquired before and after the application of the load, before and after the introduction of the artificial lesions. Principal strains were computed within the bone by means of digital volume correlation (DVC). All intact specimens showed a consistent strain distribution, with peak minimum principal strain in the range -1.8% to -0.7% in the middle of the vertebra, demonstrating the robustness of the method. Similar distributions of strains were found for the intact vertebrae in the different regions. The artificial lesion generally doubled the strain in the middle portion of the specimen, probably due to stress concentrations close to the defect. In conclusion, a robust method to evaluate the redistribution of the strain due to artificial lesions within the vertebral body was developed and will be used in the future to improve current clinical assessment of fracture risk in metastatic spines."
https://openalex.org/W3165524457,"We recently developed ‘cellular’ reagents–lyophilized bacteria overexpressing proteins of interest–that can replace commercial pure enzymes in typical diagnostic and molecular biology reactions. To make cellular reagent technology widely accessible and amenable to local production with minimal instrumentation, we now report a significantly simplified method for preparing cellular reagents that requires only a common bacterial incubator to grow and subsequently dry enzyme-expressing bacteria at 37°C with the aid of inexpensive chemical desiccants. We demonstrate application of such dried cellular reagents in common molecular and synthetic biology processes, such as PCR, qPCR, reverse transcription, isothermal amplification, and Golden Gate DNA assembly, in building easy-to-use testing kits, and in rapid reagent production for meeting extraordinary diagnostic demands such as those being faced in the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Furthermore, we demonstrate feasibility of local production by successfully implementing this minimized procedure and preparing cellular reagents in several countries, including the United Kingdom, Cameroon, and Ghana. Our results demonstrate possibilities for readily scalable local and distributed reagent production, and further instantiate the opportunities available via synthetic biology in general."
https://openalex.org/W3164665971,"Nordic catchments provide a variety of ecosystem services, from harvestable goods to mitigation of climate change and recreational possibilities. Flows of supplied ecosystem services depend on a broad range of factors, including climate, hydrology, land management and human population density. The aims of this study were: 1) to quantify the total economic value (TEV) of consumed ecosystem services across Nordic catchments, 2) to explain variation in ecosystem service value using socio-geographic and natural factors as explanatory variables in multiple linear regression, and 3) to determine which societal groups benefit from these ecosystem services. Furthermore, we tested the scientific rigour of our framework based on the concept of final ecosystem services (FES). We used a spatially explicit, integrative framework for ecosystem services quantification to compile data on final ecosystem services provision from six catchments across Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Our estimates showed a broad variation in TEV and in the proportion contributed by separate services, with the highest TEV of €7,199 ± 4,561 ha-1 y-1 (mean ± standard deviation) in the Norwegian Orrevassdraget catchment, and the lowest TEV of €183 ± 517 ha-1 y-1 in the Finnish Simojoki catchment. The value of material services was dependent on both geographic factors and land management practices, while the value of immaterial services was strongly dependent on population density and the availability of water. Using spatial data on land use, forest productivity and population density in a GIS analysis showed where hotspots of ecosystem services supply are located, and where specific stakeholder groups benefit most. We show that our framework is applicable to a broad variety of data sources and across countries, making international comparative analyses possible."
https://openalex.org/W3164132477,"Growth in open-source hardware designs combined with the decreasing cost of high-quality 3D printers have supported a resurgence of in-house custom lab equipment development. Herein, we describe a low-cost (< $400), open-source CO2 incubator. The system is comprised of a Raspberry Pi computer connected to a 3D printer controller board that has controls for a CO2 sensor, solenoid valve, heater, and thermistors. CO2 is supplied through the sublimation of dry ice stored inside a thermos to create a sustained 5% CO2 supply. The unit is controlled via G-Code commands sent by the Raspberry Pi to the controller board. In addition, we built a custom software application for remote control and used the open-source Grafana dashboard for remote monitoring. Our data show that we can maintain consistent CO2 and temperature levels for over three days without manual interruption. The results from our culture plates and real-time PCR indicate that our incubator performed equally well when compared to a much more expensive commercial CO2 incubator. We have also demonstrated that the antibiotic susceptibility assay can be performed in this low-cost CO2 incubator. Our work also indicates that the system can be connected to incubator chambers of various chamber volumes."
https://openalex.org/W3165143668,"Most corals acquire symbiodiniacean symbionts from the surrounding environment to initiate symbiosis. The cell densities of Symbiodiniaceae in the environment are usually low, and mechanisms may exist by which new coral generations attract suitable endosymbionts. Phototaxis of suitable symbiodiniacean cells toward green fluorescence in corals has been proposed as one such mechanism. In the present study, we observed the phototaxis action wavelength of various strains of Symbiodiniaceae and the fluorescence spectra of aposymbiotic Acropora tenuis larvae at the time of endosymbiont uptake. The phototaxis patterns varied among the Symbiodiniaceae species and ""native"" endosymbionts-commonly found in Acropora juveniles present in natural environments; that is, Symbiodinium microadriaticum was attracted to blue light rather than to green light. Another native endosymbiont, Durusdinium trenchii, showed no phototaxis specific to any wavelength. Although the larvae exhibited green and broad orange fluorescence under blue-violet excitation light, the maximum green fluorescence peak did not coincide with that of the phototaxis action spectrum of S. microadriaticum. Rather, around the peak wavelength of larval green fluorescence, this native endosymbiont showed slightly negative phototaxis, suggesting that the green fluorescence of A. tenuis larvae may not play a role in the initial attraction of native endosymbionts. Conversely, broad blue larval fluorescence under UV-A excitation covered the maximum phototaxis action wavelength of S. microadriaticum. We also conducted infection tests using native endosymbionts and aposymbiotic larvae under red LED light that does not excite visible larval fluorescence. Almost all larvae failed to acquire S. microadriaticum cells, whereas D. trenchii cells were acquired by larvae even under red illumination. Thus, attraction mechanisms other than visible fluorescence might exist, at least in the case of D. trenchii. Our results suggest that further investigation and discussion, not limited to green fluorescence, would be required to elucidate the initial attraction mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3165823382,"Flowering plants from the Syzygium genus have long been used in different ethnomedicinal systems worldwide and have been under scrutiny for their biological activities. Syzygium coriaceum, an endemic plant of Mauritius has been poorly studied for its potential application against cancer. Herein, Syzygium coriaceum leaf extract has been investigated for its anticancer effect against hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells. The anticancer activity was assessed using cell proliferation assays, flow cytometry, JC-1 mitochondrial membrane potential assay, and the COMET assay. Un-targeted metabolite profiling via ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution qTOF-MS (UPLC-MS) and aided by molecular networking was employed to identify the crude extract metabolites. S. coriaceum treatment induced a dose-dependent increase in lactate dehydrogenase leakage into the culture media, peaking up to 47% (p ≤ 0.0001), compared to untreated control. Moreover, at 40 μg/mL, S. coriaceum led to 88.1% (p ≤ 0.0001) drop in mitochondrial membrane potential and 5.7% (p ≤ 0.001) increased in the number of the cell population in G0/G1 phase as well as increased (p < 0.05) the proportion of cells undergoing apoptotic/necrotic cell death. More so, at 10 μg/mL, S. coriaceum induced DNA damage which was 19 folds (p < 0.001) higher than that of untreated control cells. Metabolite profiling indicated the presence of 65 metabolites, out of which 59 were identified. Tannins, flavonoids, nitrogenous compounds, and organic acids were the most predominant classes of compounds detected. Our findings showed that the presence of tannins and flavonoids in S. coriaceum leaf extract could account for the multiple mechanisms of actions underlying the antiproliferative effect against HepG2 cells."
https://openalex.org/W3164715041,"This paper contributes to the literature on topology identification (TI) in distribution networks and, in particular, on change detection in switching devices' status. The lack of measurements in distribution networks compared to transmission networks is a notable challenge. In this paper, we propose an approach to topology identification (TI) of distribution systems based on supervised machine learning (SML) algorithms. This methodology is capable of analyzing the feeder's voltage profile without requiring the utilization of sensors or any other extraneous measurement device. We show that machine learning algorithms can track the voltage profile's behavior in each feeder, detect the status of switching devices, identify the distribution system's typologies, reveal the kind of loads connected or disconnected in the system, and estimate their values. Results are demonstrated under the implementation of the ANSI case study."
https://openalex.org/W3164914361,"'Rewilding' is an increasingly prominent concept in conservation, but one that has attracted controversy. Debate frequently focuses on human 'control' over nature. 'Traditional' conservation has been presented as involving 'high control,' and rewilding as 'low control.' Opposition to rewilding often stems from a perceived lack of control and associated perception of increased risk and uncertainty. This paper explores the concept of control in conservation. I identify multiple dimensions of control ('stabilisation', 'location', 'prediction' and 'outputs'), illustrating that control is not a simple, linear concept. I compare two ethnographic case studies: the Sussex Wildlife Trust's Old Lodge nature reserve; and Knepp Estate, one of the most influential rewilding projects in the UK. I use them to test assertions made about control in 'traditional' conservation and 'rewilding'. I outline how Old Lodge does not exert precise control in all respects, but involves elements of uncertainty and negotiation. I describe how Knepp's model of rewilding reduces control in some dimensions but potentially increases it in others. I conclude that, while Knepp's rewilding does represent a significant conceptual departure from 'traditional' conservation, it should not be characterised as an approach that reduces control in a simplistic way. Based on this analysis, I argue that reduction of control does not necessarily underpin the concept of rewilding. Rather, there is interplay between different control dimensions that combine to form multiple 'configurations of control.' Using a framework of 'configurations of control', debate about the place of rewilding in conservation can become less polarised, and instead involve an active discussion of what configuration of control is desired. This analysis has the potential to increase understanding of rewilding projects as part of plural conservation strategies, in the UK and globally."
https://openalex.org/W3165191749,"Decellularized porcine corneal scaffolds are a potential alternative to human cornea for keratoplasty. Although clinical trials have reported promising results, there can be corneal haze or scar tissue. Here, we examined if recellularizing the scaffolds with human keratocytes would result in a better outcome. Scaffolds were prepared that retained little DNA (14.89 ± 5.56 ng/mg) and demonstrated a lack of cytotoxicity by in vitro . The scaffolds were recellularized using human corneal stromal cells and cultured for between 14 in serum-supplemented media followed by a further 14 days in either serum free or serum-supplemented media. All groups showed full-depth cell penetration after 14 days. When serum was present, staining for ALDH3A1 remained weak but after serum-free culture, staining was brighter and the keratocytes adopted a native dendritic morphology with an increase (p &lt; 0.05) of keratocan, decorin, lumican and CD34 gene expression. A rabbit anterior lamellar keratoplasty model was used to compare implanting a 250 μm thick decellularized lenticule against one that had been recellularized with human stromal cells after serum-free culture. In both groups, host rabbit epithelium covered the implants, but transparency was not restored after 3 months. Post-mortem histology showed under the epithelium, a less-compact collagen layer, which appeared to be a regenerating zone with some α-SMA staining, indicating fibrotic cells. In the posterior scaffold, ALDH1A1 staining was present in all the acellular scaffold, but in only one of the recellularized lenticules. Since there was little difference between acellular and cell-seeded scaffolds in our in vivo study, future scaffold development should use acellular controls to determine if cells are necessary."

This study aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with LBP among the construction workers in Nepal.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among the construction workers working in Banepa and Panauti municipalities of Kavre district, from September 2019 to February 2020. Data was collected purposively by face-to-face interview from 402 eligible participants from the both municipalities using semi-structured questionnaire. Mobile-based data collection was done using KoboCollect. Data were exported to and analysed using R-programming software (R-3.6.2). Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed. All tests were two tailed and performed at 95% confidence interval (CI).One-year prevalence of LBP among construction workers were 52.0% (95%CI: 47.0-57.0). The higher odds of LBP was reported among females [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.42; 95%CI: 1.12-5.23], those living below poverty-line (aOR = 2.35; 95%CI: 1.32-4.19), participants with more than five years of work experience (aOR = 1.66; 95%CI: 1.01-2.73) and those with intermediate sleep quality (aOR = 2.06; CI: 1.03-4.11). About 80.0% of construction workers with LBP never seek healthcare services due to: a) time constraints (90.9%), b) financial constraints (18.1%) and c) fear of losing wages on seeking healthcare services (40.9%). The majority of the participants (94.8% among those without LBP and 72.3% among those with LBP) did nothing to prevent or manage LBP.The prevalence of LBP in the past one year was high among construction workers where majority of workers never did anything to prevent or manage LBP. Therefore, the public health professionals should set up the health promotion, education, and interventions aimed at increasing awareness on preventive techniques and predisposing factors of LBP."
https://openalex.org/W3164603340,"Gambling Disorder (GD) has recently been reclassified from an impulse-control disorder to a behavioural addiction and, as in other addictive disorders, the dopaminergic reward system is involved. According to neuroimaging studies, alterations within the striatal dopaminergic signalling can occur in GD. However, the findings to date are controversial and there has been no agreement yet on how the reward system is affected on a molecular basis. Within the last 20 years, there has been growing evidence for a higher risk to develop GD in response to certain dopaminergic medication. Especially the dopamine agonists pramipexole and ropinirole, and the dopamine modulator aripiprazole seem to increase the likelihood for GD. The goal of this study was to examine the association between a prescription for either of the three pharmaceuticals and a GD diagnosis in a large cross-sectional study of the Swedish population. Compared to patients with any other dopaminergic drug prescription (38.7% with GD), the diagnosis was more common in patients with a dopamine agonist prescription (69.8% with GD), resulting in an odds ratio of 3.2. A similar association was found between aripiprazole prescriptions and GD diagnoses, which were analysed within the subgroup of all patients with schizophrenia or a schizotypal, delusional, or another non-mood psychotic disorder. An aripiprazole prescription increased the likelihood of GD (88.8%) in comparison to patients without an aripiprazole prescription (71.2%) with an odds ratio of 3.4. This study contributes to the increasingly reliable evidence for an association between several dopaminergic drugs and a higher risk for developing GD. Therefore, one future research goal should be a better understanding of the neurobiology in GD to be able to design more selective dopaminergic medication with less severe side effects. Additionally, this knowledge could enable the development of pharmacotherapy in GD and other addictive disorders."

The cholesterol-based glycolipids, cholesteryl 6-O-acyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (ACGal) and cholesteryl-β-D-galactopyranoside (CGal) are immunogenic and proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of Lyme disease. Detailed studies of CGal and ACGal in Bb have been hampered by a lack of knowledge of their underlying biosynthetic processes. The genome of Bb encodes four putative glycosyltransferases, and only one of these, BB0572, was predicted to be an inverting family 2 glycosyltransferase (GT2 enzyme) capable of using UDP-galactose as a substrate and forming a β-glycosidic bond. Comparison of the 42 kDa BB0572 amino acid sequence from Bb with other Borrelia spp demonstrates that this protein is highly conserved. To establish BB0572 as the galactosyltransferase capable of cholesterol glycolipid formation in Bb, the protein was produced as a recombinant product in Escherichia coli and tested in a cell-free assay with 14C-cholesterol and UDP-galactose as the substrates. This experiment resulted in a radiolabeled lipid that migrated with the cholesterol glycolipid standard of CGal when evaluated by thin layer chromatography. Additionally, mutation in the predicted active site of BB0572 resulted in a recombinant protein that was unable to catalyze the formation of the cholesterol glycolipid. These data characterize BB0572 as a putative cholesterol galactosyltransferase. This provides the first step in understanding how Bb cholesterol glycolipids are formed and will allow investigations into their involvement in pathogen transmission and disease development."
https://openalex.org/W3165324476,"Naturally-derived proteins or peptides are promising biopolymers for tissue engineering applications owing to their health-promoting activity. Herein, we extracted proteins (~90%) from two-spotted cricket ( Gryllus bimaculatus ) and evaluated their osteoinductive potential in human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) under in vitro conditions. The extracted protein isolate was analyzed for the amino acid composition and the mass distribution of the constituent peptide fraction. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to determine the presence of biologically significant functional groups. The cricket protein isolate (CPI) exhibited characteristic protein peaks in the FTIR spectrum. Notably, an enhanced cell viability was observed in the presence of the extracted proteins, showing their biocompatibility. The CPI also exhibited antioxidant properties in a concentration-dependent manner. More significant mineralization was observed in the CPI-treated cells than in the control, suggesting their osteoinductive potential. The upregulation of the osteogenic marker genes ( Runx2 , ALP , OCN , and BSP ) in CPI treated media compared with the control supports their osteoinductive nature. Therefore, cricket-derived protein isolates could be used as functional protein isolate for tissue engineering applications, especially for bone regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3165465186,"C. albicans is a commensal organism present in the human microbiome of more than 60% of the healthy population. Transition from commensalism to invasive candidiasis may occur after a local or a general failure of host's immune system. This transition to a more virulent phenotype may reside either on the capacity to form hyphae or on an acquired resistance to antifungal drugs. Indeed, overexpression of genes coding drug efflux pumps or adhesins, cell wall proteins facilitating the contact between the fungus and the host, usually marks the virulence profile of invasive Candida spp. In this paper, we compare virulence of two clinical isolates of C. albicans with that of laboratory-induced resistant strains by challenging G. mellonella larvae with these pathogens along with monitoring transcriptional profiles of drug efflux pumps genes CDR1, CDR2, MDR1 and the adhesin genes ALS1 and HWP1. Although both clinical isolates were found resistant to both fluconazole and micafungin they were found less virulent than laboratory-induced resistant strains. An unexpected behavior emerged for the former clinical isolate in which three genes, CDR1, CDR2 and HWP1, usually correlated with virulence, although hyperexpressed, conferred a less aggressive phenotype. On the contrary, in the other isolate, we observed a decreased expression of CDR1, CDR2 and HWP1as well as of MDR1 and ALS1 that may be consistent with the less aggressive performance observed in this strain. These altered gene expressions might directly influence Candida virulence or they might be an epiphenomenon of a vaster rearrangement occurred in these strains during the challenge with the host's environment. An in-deepth comprehension of this scenario could be crucial for developing interventions able to counteract C. albicans invasiveness and lethality."
https://openalex.org/W3165759605,"The pace of decline in fertility rates in sub-Saharan Africa appears to have slowed or stalled in the last few decades. This study examines the socioeconomic associated with cumulative fertility in Ghana. Negative binomial regression models were used to estimate determinants of cumulative fertility using data from the Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys of 2003, 2008, and 2014. The composition of children ever born by women did not change considerably over the study periods. Socioeconomic disparities in educational attainment, household wealth, employment, and employer status are significantly associated with cumulative fertility risks in Ghana. The current age of women, age at sexual debut, and marital status, among others, are also linked to cumulative fertility levels. Place and region of residence are also linked to fertility in Ghana. Cumulative fertility levels in Ghana are underscored by considerable socioeconomic disparities among women of reproductive age. Fertility regulation policies should hinge on improving the socio-economic wellbeing of women in Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W3165793269,"People's preference to help single victims about whom they have some information is known as the identifiable victim effect. Previous research suggests that this effect stems from an intensive emotional reaction toward specific victims. The findings of two studies consistently show that the identifiability effect is attenuated when the subject is in a positive mood. Study 1 (along with a pilot study) demonstrate causal relationships between mood and identifiability, while using different manipulations to induce moods. In both studies, donations to identified victims exceeded donations to unidentified people-in the Negative Mood manipulations-while participants in the Positive Mood conditions showed no such preference. In Study 2, individual differences in people's moods interacted with the recipient's identifiability in predicting donations, demonstrating that the identifiability effect is attenuated by a positive mood. In addition, emotional reactions toward the victims replicate the donation pattern, suggesting emotions as a possible explanation for the observed donation pattern."

Health care workers are a high-risk category because of their professional exposure.This cross-sectional study assessed the LTBI burden among health care workers in Afghanistan, a high-TB-burden country. We selected health facilities using a systematic sampling technique and invited all workers at the targeted health facilities to participate. Participants were interviewed about sociodemographic and exposure variables and received tuberculin skin tests for LTBI.Of the 4,648 health care workers invited to participate, 3,686 had tuberculin skin tests. The prevalence of LTBI was found to be 47.2% (1,738 workers). Multivariate analysis showed that a body mass index of ≥ 30 and marriage were associated with an increased risk of LTBI. Underweight (body mass index of ≤ 18 and below) and normal body mass index had no association with increased risk of LTBI.LTBI is high among health care workers in Afghanistan. We recommend instituting infection control measures in health facilities and screening workers for timely TB diagnosis."

https://openalex.org/W3165061310,"Aedes-borne viral diseases mainly Yellow Fever (YF), Dengue (DEN), Zika (ZIK) and Chikungunya (CHK) have contributed to many deaths' in the world especially in Africa. There have been major outbreaks of these diseases in West Africa. Although, YF outbreaks have occurred in Ghana over the years, no outbreak of DEN, ZIK and CHK has been recorded. However, the risk of outbreak is high due to its proximity to West African countries where outbreaks have been recently been recorded. This study surveyed the mosquito fauna to assess the risk of transmission of Yellow fever (YFV), Dengue (DENV), Chikungunya (CHKV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses in Larabanga and Mole Game Reserve areas in Northern Ghana. The immature and adult stages of Aedes mosquitoes were collected from Larabanga and Mole Game Reserve area. There was a significant (P>0.001) number of mosquitoes collected during the rainy season than the dry season. A total of 1,930 Aedes mosquitoes were collected during the rainy season and morphologically identified. Of these, 1,915 (99.22%) were Aedes aegypti and 15 (0.22%) were Aedes vittatus. During the dry season, 27 Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were collected. A total of 415 Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were molecularly identified to subspecies level of which Ae. (Ae) aegypti aegypti was the predominant subspecies. Both Ae. aegypti aegypti and Ae aegypti formosus exist in sympatry in the area. All Aedes pools (75) were negative for DENV, ZIKV and CHKV when examined by RT- PCR. Three Larval indices namely House Index, HI (percentage of houses positive for Aedes larvae or pupae), Container Index, CI (the percentage of containers positive for Aedes larvae or pupae) and Breteau Index, BI (number of positive containers per 100 houses inspected) were assessed as a measure for risk of transmission in the study area. The HI, CI and BI for both sites were as follows; Mole Game Reserve (HI, 42.1%, CI, 23.5% and BI, 100 for rainy season and 0 for all indices for dry season) and Larabanga (39%, 15.5% and 61 for rainy season and 2.3%, 1.3% and 2.3 for dry season). The spatial distribution of Aedes breeding sites in both areas indicated that Aedes larvae were breeding in areas with close proximity to humans. Lorry tires were the main source of Aedes larvae in all the study areas. Information about the species composition and the potential role of Aedes mosquitoes in future outbreaks of the diseases that they transmit is needed to design efficient surveillance and vector control tools."
https://openalex.org/W3165692769,"Background Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) reduces tuberculosis reactivation and mortality among persons living with HIV (PLWH), yet hepatotoxicity concerns exclude “regular and heavy alcohol drinkers” from IPT. We aimed to determine the prevalence of elevated liver transaminases among PLWH on antiretroviral therapy (ART) who engage in alcohol use. Setting The Immune Suppression Syndrome Clinic of Mbarara, Uganda. Methods We defined elevated liver transaminases as ≥1.25 times (X) the upper limit of normal (ULN) for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST). We evaluated the associations of current alcohol use and other variables of interest (sex, body mass index, and ART regimen) with elevated transaminases at study screening, using multivariable logistic regression to obtain adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Among 1301 participants (53% female, median age 39 years, 67.4% current alcohol use), 18.8% (95% CI: 16.8–21.1) had elevated transaminases pre-IPT, with few (1.1%) severe (≥5X the ULN). The proportion with any elevation among those currently using alcohol and those abstaining was 22.3% and 11.6%, respectively (p&lt;0.01). In multivariable analyses, those currently using alcohol had higher odds of elevated transaminases compared to those abstaining (aOR 1.65, 95% CI 1.15–2.37) as did males compared to females (aOR 2.68, 95% CI 1.90–3.78). Conclusions Pre-IPT elevated transaminases among PLWH receiving ART were common, similar to prior estimates, but severe elevations were rare. Current drinking and male sex were independently associated with elevated transaminases. Further research is needed to determine the implications of such transaminase elevations and alcohol use on providing IPT."
https://openalex.org/W3150549848,"Neosadocus harvestmen are endemic to the Southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Although they are conspicuous and display great morphological variation, their evolutionary history and the biogeographical events underlying their diversification and distribution are still unknown. This contribution about Neosadocus includes the following: a taxonomic revision; a molecular phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear markers; an investigation of the genetic structure and species' diversity in a phylogeographical framework. Our results show that Neosadocus is a monophyletic group and comprises four species: N. bufo, N. maximus, N. robustus and N. misandrus (which we did not find on fieldwork and only studied the female holotype). There is astonishing male polymorphism in N. robustus, mostly related to reproductive strategies. The following synonymies have resulted from this work: ""Bunoweyhia"" variabilis Mello-Leitão, 1935 = Neosadocus bufo (Mello-Leitão, 1926); and ""Bunoweyhia"" minor Mello-Leitão, 1935 = Neosadocus maximus (Giltay, 1928). Most divergences occurred during the Miocene, a geological epoch marked by intense orogenic and climatic events in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Intraspecific analyses indicate strong population structure, a pattern congruent with the general behavior and physiological constraints of Neotropical harvestmen."
https://openalex.org/W3155642018,"Asthma is a heterogeneous disease with neutrophilic and eosinophilic asthma as the main endotypes that are distinguished according to the cells recruited to the airways and the related pathology. Eosinophilic asthma is the treatment-responsive endotype, which is mainly associated with allergic asthma. Neutrophilic asthma is a treatment-resistant endotype, affecting 5-10% of asthmatics. Although eosinophilic asthma is well-studied, a clear understanding of the endotypes is essential to devise effective diagnosis and treatment approaches for neutrophilic asthma. To this end, we directly compared adjuvant-induced mouse models of neutrophilic (CFA/OVA) and eosinophilic (Alum/OVA) asthma side-by-side. The immune response in the inflamed lung was analyzed by multi-parametric flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. We found that eosinophilic asthma was characterized by a preferential recruitment of interstitial macrophages and myeloid dendritic cells, whereas in neutrophilic asthma plasmacytoid dendritic cells, exudate macrophages, and GL7+ activated B cells predominated. This differential distribution of macrophage and dendritic cell subsets reveals important aspects of the pathophysiology of asthma and holds the promise to be used as biomarkers to diagnose asthma endotypes."
https://openalex.org/W3164442816,"An acceleration index is proposed as a novel indicator to track the dynamics of COVID-19 in real-time. Using data on cases and tests in France for the period between the first and second lock-downs—May 13 to October 25, 2020—our acceleration index shows that the pandemic resurgence can be dated to begin around July 7. It uncovers that the pandemic acceleration was stronger than national average for the [59–68] and especially the 69 and older age groups since early September, the latter being associated with the strongest acceleration index, as of October 25. In contrast, acceleration among the [19–28] age group was the lowest and is about half that of the [69–78]. In addition, we propose an algorithm to allocate tests among French “départements” (roughly counties), based on both the acceleration index and the feedback effect of testing. Our acceleration-based allocation differs from the actual distribution over French territories, which is population-based. We argue that both our acceleration index and our allocation algorithm are useful tools to guide public health policies as France might possibly enter a third lock-down period with indeterminate duration."
https://openalex.org/W3164817218,"The phyllosphere is the aerial part of plants that is exposed to different environmental conditions and is also known to harbor a wide variety of bacteria including both plant and human pathogens. However, studies on phyllosphere bacterial communities have focused on bacterial composition at different stages of plant growth without correlating their functional capabilities to bacterial communities. In this study, we examined the seasonal effects and temporal variabilities driving bacterial community composition and function in spinach phyllosphere due to increasing salinity and season and estimated the functional capacity of bacterial community16S V4 rRNA gene profiles by indirectly inferring the abundance of functional genes based on metagenomics inference tool Piphillin. The experimental design involved three sets of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L., cv. Racoon) grown with saline water during different seasons. Total bacteria DNA from leaf surfaces were sequenced using MiSeq® Illumina platform. About 66.35% of bacteria detected in the phyllosphere were dominated by four phyla- Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria. Permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) showed that phyllosphere microbiomes were significantly (P < 0.003) affected by season, but not salinity (P = 0.501). The most abundant inferred functional pathways in leaf samples were the amino acids biosynthesis, ABC transporters, ribosome, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, two-component system, carbon metabolism, purine metabolism, and pyrimidine metabolism. The photosynthesis antenna proteins pathway was significantly enriched in June leaf samples, when compared to March and May. Several genes related to toxin co-regulated pilus biosynthesis proteins were also significantly enriched in June leaf samples, when compared to March and May leaf samples. Therefore, planting and harvesting times must be considered during leafy green production due to the influence of seasons in growth and proliferation of phyllosphere microbial communities."

This study discovered a new mechanism of misinformation diffusion in the case of GM food and applied a framework of supervised machine learning to identify effective credibility indicators for the misinformation prediction of GM food. Main indicators are proposed, including user identities involved in spreading information, linguistic styles, and propagation dynamics. Results show that linguistic styles, including sentiment and topics, have the dominant predictive power. In addition, among the user identities, engagement, and extroversion are effective predictors, while reputation has almost no predictive power in this study. Finally, we provide strategies that readers should be aware of when assessing the credibility of online posts and suggest improvements that Weibo can use to avoid rumormongering and enhance the science communication of GM food."

However, the prognostic and therapeutic relevance of FGF and IGF pathways in PDAC is largely unknown.We investigated the relationship between fibroblast and insulin pathway gene expression and clinicopathological features in three independent transcriptomic cohorts of 532 PDAC patients. Furthermore, we have examined the coexpressed genes specific to the prognostic marker identified from these cohorts. Statistical tests including Fisher-exact\Chi-square, Kaplan-Meier, Pearson Correlation and cox regression analyses were performed. Additionally, pathway analysis of gene-specific co-expressed genes was also performed.The dysregulation of six genes including FGF9, FGF14, FGFR1, FGFR4, IGF2BP2 and IGF2BP3 were significantly associated with different clinical characteristics (including grade, stage, recurrence and nodes) in PDAC cohorts. 11 genes (including FGF9, FGF13, FGF14, FGF17, FGFR1, FGFRL1, FGFBP3, IGFBP3, IGF2BP2, IGF2BP3 and IGFBPL1) showed association with overall survival in different PDAC cohorts. Interestingly, overexpression of FGF14 was found associated with better overall survival (OS) in all three cohorts. Of note, multivariate analysis also revealed FGF14 as an independent prognostic marker for better OS in all three cohorts. Furthermore, FMN2 and PGR were among the top genes that correlated with FGF14 in all 3 cohorts. Of note, overexpression of FMN2 and PGR was found significantly associated with good overall survival in PDAC patients, suggesting FMN2 and PGR can also act as potential markers for the prediction of prognosis in PDAC patients.FGF14 may define a distinct subset of PDAC patients with better prognosis. Moreover, FGF14-based sub-classification of PDAC suggests that FMN2 and PGR can be employed as good prognostic markers in PDAC and this classification may lead to new therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3165311530,"Living organisms are continuously under threat from a vast array of DNA-damaging agents, which impact genome DNA. DNA replication machinery stalls at damaged template DNA. The stalled replication fork is restarted via bypass replication by translesion DNA-synthesis polymerases, including the Y-family polymerases Polη, Polι, and Polκ, which possess the ability to incorporate nucleotides opposite the damaged template. To investigate the division of labor among these polymerases in vivo, we generated POLη-/-, POLι-/-, POLκ-/-, double knockout (KO), and triple knockout (TKO) mutants in all combinations from human TK6 cells. TKO cells exhibited a hypersensitivity to ultraviolet (UV), cisplatin (CDDP), and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), confirming the pivotal role played by these polymerases in bypass replication of damaged template DNA. POLη-/- cells, but not POLι-/- or POLκ-/- cells, showed a strong sensitivity to UV and CDDP, while TKO cells showed a slightly higher sensitivity to UV and CDDP than did POLη-/- cells. On the other hand, TKO cells, but not all single KO cells, exhibited a significantly higher sensitivity to MMS than did wild-type cells. Consistently, DNA-fiber assay revealed that Polη plays a crucial role in bypassing lesions caused by UV-mimetic agent 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide and CDDP, while all three polymerases play complementary roles in bypassing MMS-induced damage. Our findings indicate that the three Y-family polymerases play distinctly different roles in bypass replication, according to the type of DNA damage generated on the template strand."

In this exploratory study, the contribution of environmental factors on the progression of AMD pathology by probing the expression of candidate proteins was analyzed. Four hundred and sixty four participants were recruited in the study comprising of AMD (n = 277) and controls (n = 187). Genetics related data was analyzed to demonstrate the activities of daily living (ADL) by using regression analysis and statistical modeling, including contrast estimate, multinomial regression analysis in AMD progression. Regression analysis revealed contribution of smoking, alcohol, and sleeping hours on AMD by altered expression of IER-3, HTRA1, B3GALTL, LIPC and TIMP3 as compared to normal levels. Contrast estimate supports the gender polarization phenomenon in AMD by significant decreased expression of SLC16A8 and LIPC in control population which was found to be unaltered in AMD patients. The smoking, food habits and duration of night sleeping hours also contributed in AMD progression as evident from multinomial regression analysis. Predicted model (prediction estimate = 86.7%) also indicated the crucial role of night sleeping hours along with the decreased expression of TIMP-3, IER3 and SLC16A8. Results revealed an unambiguous role of environmental factors in AMD progression mediated by various regulatory proteins which might result in intermittent AMD phenotypes and possibly influence the outcome of anti-VEGF treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3164037506,"Self-organized patterning of mammalian embryonic stem cells on micropatterned surfaces has previously been established as an in vitro platform for early mammalian developmental studies, complimentary to in vivo studies. Traditional micropatterning methods, such as micro-contact printing (μCP), involve relatively complicated fabrication procedures, which restricts widespread adoption by biologists. Here, we demonstrate a rapid method of micropatterning by printing hydrogel micro-features onto a glass-bottomed culture vessel. The micro-features are printed using a projection stereolithography bioprinter yielding hydrogel structures that geometrically restrict the attachment of cells or proteins. Compared to traditional and physical photomasks, a digitally tunable virtual photomask is used in the projector to generate blue light patterns that enable rapid iteration with minimal cost and effort. We show that a protocol that makes use of this method together with LN521 coating, an extracellular matrix coating, creates a surface suitable for human embryonic stem cell (hESC) attachment and growth with minimal non-specific adhesion. We further demonstrate that self-patterning of hESCs following previously published gastrulation and ectodermal induction protocols achieves results comparable with those obtained with commercially available plates."
https://openalex.org/W3164115580,"5M mutant lipase was derived through cumulative mutagenesis of amino acid residues (D43E/T118N/E226D/E250L/N304E) of T1 lipase from Geobacillus zalihae. A previous study revealed that cumulative mutations in 5M mutant lipase resulted in decreased thermostability compared to wild-type T1 lipase. Multiple amino acids substitution might cause structural destabilization due to negative cooperation. Hence, the three-dimensional structure of 5M mutant lipase was elucidated to determine the evolution in structural elements caused by amino acids substitution. A suitable crystal for X-ray diffraction was obtained from an optimized formulation containing 0.5 M sodium cacodylate trihydrate, 0.4 M sodium citrate tribasic pH 6.4 and 0.2 M sodium chloride with 2.5 mg/mL protein concentration. The three-dimensional structure of 5M mutant lipase was solved at 2.64 Å with two molecules per asymmetric unit. The detailed analysis of the structure revealed that there was a decrease in the number of molecular interactions, including hydrogen bonds and ion interactions, which are important in maintaining the stability of lipase. This study facilitates understanding of and highlights the importance of hydrogen bonds and ion interactions towards protein stability. Substrate specificity and docking analysis on the open structure of 5M mutant lipase revealed changes in substrate preference. The molecular dynamics simulation of 5M-substrates complexes validated the substrate preference of 5M lipase towards long-chain p-nitrophenyl-esters."
https://openalex.org/W3164409757,"The increasingly globalized workforce and the growing need for boosting employee energy have engendered both practical and research interest in stimulating employee energy in intercultural interactions. Yet neither the culture research nor the energy literature has explored the link between cultural distance and employee relational energy—the heightened level of psychological resources in social relations. This paper presents empirical evidence of cultural distance stimulating relational energy. Further, building upon the threat-rigidity theory, I propose that cultural distance stimulates relational energy more when employees perceive high levels of psychological safety. Two studies were conducted to test these two hypotheses. One laboratory experiment on 202 international students at a Dutch university provided causal evidence of the positive relationship between cultural distance and relational energy. Next, a two-wave field study on 373 international employees was conducted to replicate this main effect of cultural distance and further investigate the moderating role of psychological safety. Results supported that employees with higher levels of psychological safety are more prone to experience enhanced relational energy as a result of cultural distance. These findings contribute to the scarce research on possible positive influence of cross-cultural communication at work, and also advance the growing research on the antecedents of employee relational energy. The implications for practitioners to energize employees are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3164460365,"The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that only 17–37% of the approximately 77 million people who need a wheelchair have access to one. Many organizations are trying to address this need through varying service delivery approaches. For instance, some adhere to WHO’s recommended 8-steps service approach while others provide wheelchairs with little to no service. There is limited and sometimes conflicting evidence of the impact of the WHO’s recommendations on the outcomes of wheelchair provision. To help build this evidence, we \explored outcomes of two groups of users who received their wheelchairs through two service models over time. The 8-Steps group ( n = 118) received a wheelchair selected from a range of models from service providers trained using the WHO process, and the standard of care (SOC) group ( n = 24) received hospital-style wheelchairs and without clinical service. Interviews were conducted at baseline and at follow-up 3 to 6 months after provision, to collect data about wheelchair usage, satisfaction, skills, maintenance and repairs, and life satisfaction. Across-group statistical comparisons were not appropriate due to significant differences between groups. In general, participants used their wheelchairs every day but reported very low mobility levels (&lt;500 meters for the 8-steps group, and &lt;100 meters for the SOC group.) The 8-steps group used their wheelchair for either between 1–3 hours per day, or more than 8 hours per day. The SOC used it between 1 and 3 hours per day. Overall, wheelchair usage and wheelchair skills decreased over the 3- to 6-month data collection timeline. Wheelchair breakdowns were common in both groups emphasizing the need for maintenance, occurring more frequently in the 8-Steps (28.8%) compared to the SOC group (8%), and emphasizing the need for maintenance services. No significant differences were found when comparing device satisfaction across wheelchairs types. Our results emphasize the need for routine maintenance to address frequent wheelchair breakdowns. Our results also demonstrate a large disparity in several outcome variables across groups which motivates future studies where across-group comparisons are possible."

However, the physical and psychological burden of IVF can negatively impact psychological wellbeing, as well as treatment retention and success. Social support has been found to have positive health effects among populations facing health-related stressors worldwide, and its potential protective role for IVF patients merits further attention. We present a protocol for a systematic review of peer-reviewed published studies quantitatively investigating associations between social support and i) mental health; ii) the decision to (dis)continue with IVF treatment cycles and; iii) IVF success (pregnancy and birth rates); among individuals who are undertaking or have undertaken IVF cycles. Studies will be included if they work with human subjects, provide correlation coefficients between measures of social support and at least one of the outcomes of interest, and are in the English language. Social support may derive from both naturally occurring networks and more formalized sources or interventions. The protocol for this systematic review was developed according to the PRISMA-P guidelines. Ten health-, psychology- and sociology-related databases will be searched using composite search terms that include keywords for ‘IVF’ and ‘social support’. To assess methodological quality, the authors will use a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Should three or more moderate or good quality studies be identified for any one outcome of interest, correlation meta-analyses, using the Hedges-Olkin method, will be conducted to pool effect sizes and heterogeneity will be assessed. Should the number, quality and characteristics of eligible studies not allow for reliable quantitative synthesis, the authors will limit the analysis to qualitative synthesis, with a focus on implications of findings for future research and programming."

This study is the first empirical attempt to analyse the notion of proven experience as it is understood by Swedish physicians and nurses. Using statistical techniques for data dimensionality reduction ( confirmatory factor analysis and multidimensional scaling ), the study provides evidence that the proven experience concept is multidimensional and that a model consisting of three dimensions–for brevity referred to as “test/evidence”, “practice”, and “being an experienced/competent person”–describes the survey responses well. In addition, our results cannot corroborate the widely held assumption in evidence-based medicine that an important component of clinical expertise consists of experience of patients’ preferences."

ANS variables were measured during the subsequent phases which characterise ISCLS flares, namely the acute phase, the post-acute phase, and the recovery phase.HRV was severely depressed during the acute phase accounting for the loss of ANS modulation during massive capillary extravasation. This phase was characterised by shock and impaired baroreflex control, which allowed SAP to oscillate driven by respiratory activity. Impending shock and transition from shock to a post-acute phase were marked by change of baroreflex spectral variables. The baroreflex control was fully restored during recovery.ANS modulation and baroreflex control are severely impaired during the acute haemodynamic instability which characterises ISCLS crises and their progressive restoration may be a clue of improvement. ANS indices during ISCLS flares might serve as useful biomarkers, able to timely announce the transition from one phase to the subsequent one, thus helping to adapt therapy accordingly."
https://openalex.org/W3165256159,"In view of the development direction of high power and miniaturization of high-voltage power supply, higher requirements are put forward for the breakdown strength, thermal conductivity of packaging materials for its high voltage output module. An electric-insulated heat-conducted material with aluminium nitride as heat conducting filler and addition-cure liquid silicone rubber (ALSR) as matrix for high voltage power encapsulation has been studied. Initially, the thermal conductivity and breakdown strength of composites were explored at different filler fractions. With increase of filler fraction, the thermal conductivity increased and the breakdown strength decreased. Then, with the packaging module volume as the optimization objective and the working temperature as the optimization condition, the temperature distribution of high voltage power supply was studied by using the finite element method, and 40wt% filling fraction was selected as the optimal ratio. Finally, the actual packaging experiment of the high voltage module is carried out. and the variation of the output voltage and temperature with the working time is obtained. According to the experimental results, the output voltage of the high voltage module is basically stable, and the maximum surface temperature is 40.4°C. The practicability of the electric-insulated heat-conducted material has been proved."
https://openalex.org/W3165664649,"Background Cervical cancer screening (CCS) and human papillomavirus vaccination (HPVV) are effective measures against cervical cancer (CC). Attendance in HPVV and CCS provides the greatest protection, while combined non-attendance in HPVV and CCS provides little to no protection. It is hence concerning that some large ethnic minority groups show considerably lower HPVV and CCS attendance than other women–especially women from Middle-Eastern and North African (MENA) countries and Pakistan. Little is, however, known about the reasons for this low combined attendance pattern n. Aim To explore perceptions of and barriers to HPVV and CCS, among MENA and Pakistani women in Denmark. Method Focus group interviews were conducted. Data was transcribed verbatim, and analysed using systematic text condensation. Findings Seventeen long-term resident women originating from six major MENA countries and Pakistan were included. Mean age was 36 years. We found that these women, across different age groups and descent, had sparse knowledge and understanding about CC, and their perceived relevance of disease prevention was low. Compared to HPVV, their barriers to CCS were more fixed and often linked to socio-cultural factors such as taboos related to female genitals and sexuality. Moreover, they presented unmet expectations and signs of mistrust in the healthcare system. However, at the end of the interviews, participants became more attentive toward CC prevention, particularly toward HPVV. Conclusion Elements of insufficient knowledge and understanding of CC and its prevention were found among a group of MENA and Pakistani women. Their socio-cultural background further represents a barrier particularly towards CCS. Additionally, negative experiences and unmet expectations lessen their trust in the healthcare system. All of which underlines the need for new tailored CC preventive strategies for this group. Based on our findings we suggest that future studies develop and evaluate interventions aiming to improve HPVV and CCS, including user-involvement."
https://openalex.org/W3106276067,"Peer-grouping is used in many sectors for organisational learning, policy implementation, and benchmarking. Clustering provides a statistical, data-driven method for constructing meaningful peer groups, but peer groups must be compatible with business constraints such as size and stability considerations. Additionally, statistical peer groups are constructed from many different variables, and can be difficult to understand, especially for non-statistical audiences. We developed methodology to apply business constraints to clustering solutions and allow the decision-maker to choose the balance between statistical goodness-of-fit and conformity to business constraints. Several tools were utilised to identify complex distinguishing features in peer groups, and a number of visualisations are developed to explain high-dimensional clusters for non-statistical audiences. In a case study where peer group size was required to be small (≤ 100 members), we applied constrained clustering to a noisy high-dimensional data-set over two subsequent years, ensuring that the clusters were sufficiently stable between years. Our approach not only satisfied clustering constraints on the test data, but maintained an almost monotonic negative relationship between goodness-of-fit and stability between subsequent years. We demonstrated in the context of the case study how distinguishing features between clusters can be communicated clearly to different stakeholders with substantial and limited statistical knowledge."
