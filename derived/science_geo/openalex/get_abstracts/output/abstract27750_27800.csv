https://openalex.org/W2078709292,"A 60 amino acid domain of the myogenic determination gene MyoD is necessary and sufficient for sequence-specific DNA binding in vitro and myogenic conversion of transfected C3H10T1/2 cells. We show that a highly basic region, immediately upstream of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) oligomerization motif, is required for MyoD DNA binding in vitro. Replacing helix1, helix2, or the loop of MyoD with the analogous sequence of the Drosophila T4 achaete-scute protein (required for peripheral neurogenesis) has no substantial effect on DNA binding in vitro or muscle-specific gene activation in transfected C3H10T1/2 cells. However, replacing the basic region of MyoD with the analogous sequence of other HLH proteins (the immunoglobulin enhancer binding E12 protein or T4 achaete scute protein) allows DNA binding in vitro, yet abolishes muscle-specific gene activation. These findings suggest that a recognition code that determines muscle-specific gene activation lies within the MyoD basic region and that the capacity for specific DNA binding is insufficient to activate the muscle program."
https://openalex.org/W2011497948,"We report here on gene transfer studies designed to investigate the function of the α5β1 integrin and its role in transformation. Transfection of the human α5 and β1 cDNAs into transformed Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells followed by methotrexate-induced amplification yielded clonal cell lines overexpressing this fibronectin receptor. The overexpressors deposited more fibronectin in their extracellular matrix and migrated less than control cells. In addition, they showed reduced saturation density and reduced ability to grow in soft agar. The overexpressor cells, unlike the control CHO cells, were nontumorigenic when injected subcutaneously into nude mice. The results indicate that extracellular matrix recognition by the α5β1 integrin plays a role in the control of cell proliferation and suggest that a reduction of this fibronectin receptor may be responsible for the acquisition of anchorage independence by transformed cells."

https://openalex.org/W2019797676,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of the GTPase activating protein (GAP) in 3T3 cells and in CHO cells expressing wild-type PDGF receptors, but not in several CHO cell lines expressing mutant receptors defective in transmitting mitogenic signals. Following PDGF treatment of cells, GAP physically associated with the PDGF receptor and with Raf-1, phospholipase c-gamma, and PI-3 kinase, suggesting that PDGF induced the formation of complexes of signaling molecules. The association of GAP with the PDGF receptor and the phosphorylation of GAP with the PDGF receptor and the phosphorylation of GAP were reconstituted in vitro using purified protein and in insect cells expressing murine PDGF receptor and human GAP. However, in cells transformed by activated c-Ha-ras, which are defective in certain responses to PDGF, GAP failed to associate with the PDGF receptor or increase its phosphotyrosine content in response to PDGF. The association of GAP with ligand-activated PDGF receptors may directly link PDGF and ras signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2065923747,"The first cleavage in mammalian pre-rRNA maturation occurs near the 5' end within the 5' external transcribed spacer. Using mouse cell extracts, we show that this processing is abolished by micrococcal nuclease pretreatment. Autoantibodies that recognize the U3, U8, and U13 snRNPs (anti-fibrillarin) deplete processing activity from the extract and selectively immunoprecipitate both rRNA substrates and processing products from the reaction. Specific involvement of the U3 snRNP is demonstrated by native gel electrophoresis of the processing reaction followed by Northern blotting and by oligonucleotide-directed RNAase H abolition of processing activity. Our identification of U3 function is discussed with respect to the molecular basis of pre-rRNA recognition by the U3 snRNP, possible roles of U3 and other nucleolar snRNPs in rRNA processing, and the morphological organization of the nucleolus and the ribosomal transcription complex."
https://openalex.org/W1992438598,"We studied the intracellular traffic and subcellular distribution of MHC class I and class II antigens in comparison with a recycling surface glycoprotein, the transferrin receptor (Tfr), in the human lymphoblastoid cell line JY. No internalization was detectable for class I molecules. Class II molecules were internalized but did not recycle. In contrast, Tfr was found to internalize and recycle. The biosynthetic pathway of class II molecules differ from that of class I molecules in that it shows a delay (1-3 hr) in transport from trans-Golgi to cell surface: here it intersects the endocytic route. Immunoelectron microscopy using anti-MHC antibodies revealed the existence of vesicular structures that were intensely labeled for class II molecules. It is proposed that at this site combination of class II molecules with processed antigen could occur."
https://openalex.org/W2081495213,"Minichromosomes containing the MMTV hormone responsive element (HRE) exhibit precisely positioned nucleosomes. Chromatin reconstitution of short HRE DNA fragments also results in precise positioning of nucleosomes as revealed by footprinting, which suggests that information for nucleosome phasing is contained within this short sequence. While hormone receptors bind naked DNA and reconstituted nucleosomes with similar affinities (3- to 5-fold difference), NFI, a transcription factor essential for efficient utilization of the MMTV promoter, binds naked DNA very tightly but does not bind the nucleosomally organized promoter. Hormone receptor binding to the MMTV nucleosome does not dissociate the nucleosome but leads to greater accessibility of the promoter-proximal end to exonuclease III. Precise positioning of one nucleosome over the MMTV promoter could repress transcription by preventing NFI binding in the absence of hormone, while still allowing interaction of activated hormone receptor with HRE."
https://openalex.org/W1495834546,"G protein-coupled receptors comprise a family of genes that share significant sequence similarity. We have screened a rat genomic library under low stringency hybridization conditions with the coding portion of the hamster beta 2-adrenergic receptor gene to isolate new members of this gene family. We show that one of these clones, clone D, codes for a 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) binding site since: 1) it possesses an intronless open reading frame encoding a protein with seven putative transmembrane domains and 89% amino acid identity with the human 5-HT1A receptor (G21); 2) when transfected into Ltk- cells, it expresses a ligand-binding site with the pharmacology of the 5-HT1A receptor subtype, including 5-HT- and spiroxatrine-displaceable binding of 8-hydroxy-(2-(N,N-di[2,3-3H]propylamino)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (KH = 0.8 nM). We further show that clone D encodes a functional receptor because its binding site interacts with G proteins and because it mediates agonist-induced inhibition of basal and stimulated cAMP accumulation in transfected GH4C1 pituitary cells. Finally, we have analyzed the tissue distribution of 5-HT1A receptor mRNA in rat brain and have found that 5-HT1A mRNA is present with the expected distribution of the 5-HT1A receptor (highest in septum and hippocampus) but is present as three RNA species (3.9, 3.6, and 3.3 kilobases). These studies represent the first characterization of receptor function and brain distribution of the cloned rat 5-HT1A receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2155769589,"The segmented pattern of peripheral spinal nerves in higher vertebrates is generated by interactions between nerve cells and somites. Neural crest cells, motor axons, and sensory axons grow exclusively through anterior-half sclerotome. In chick embryos, posterior cells bind the lectins peanut agglutinin (PNA) and Jacalin. When liposomes containing somite extracts are applied to cultures of chick sensory neurons, growth cones collapse abruptly, recovering within 4 hr of liposome removal. Collapse activity is eliminated by immobilized PNA, and SDS-PAGE demonstrates two major components (48K and 55K), which are absent from anterior-half sclerotome. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against these components recognize only posterior cells and may also be used to eliminate collapse activity. We suggest that spinal nerve segmentation is produced by inhibitory interactions between these components and growth cones."
https://openalex.org/W2071877947,"We have devised a simple bioassay for the identification of molecules that inhibit growth cone motility. Chick dorsal root ganglion (DRG) growth cones extending on laminin collapse when exposed to a suspension of embryonic brain membranes. Detergent-solubilized membranes from which the detergent has been removed collapse DRG growth cones extending on either laminin or chick L1. Collapse occurs over a time course of minutes and is fully reversible. Solubilized liver, primary fibroblast, or RN22 schwannoma cell membranes do not collapse DRG or retinal growth cones. Solubilized PC12 membranes cause retinal but not DRG growth cones to collapse. The collapsing activity from embryonic brain is heat-labile, is trypsin-sensitive, and behaves as a macromolecule on a sizing column. It can be enriched 100-fold by chromatography on heparin and hydroxylapatite. These results are consistent with the idea that growth cone motility is inhibited by specific membrane-associated proteins in the developing nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W2023699384,"A cDNA for a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family was isolated from Drosophila using a probe derived from a human beta 2-adrenergic receptor cDNA. This Drosophila receptor gene is localized at 99A10-B1 on the right arm of chromosome 3 and is preferentially expressed in Drosophila heads. The insect octopamine receptor has been permanently expressed in mammalian cells, where it mediates the attenuation of adenylate cyclase activity and exhibits a pharmacological profile consistent with an octopamine type 1 receptor. Sequence and pharmacological comparisons indicate that the octopamine receptor is unique but closely related to mammalian adrenergic receptors, perhaps as an evolutionary precursor."
https://openalex.org/W2038794309,"Under stationary conditions, opening and closing of single Torpedo electroplax chloride channels show that the number of transitions per unit time between inactivated and conducting states are unequal in opposite directions. This asymmetry, which increases with transmembrane electrochemical gradient for the chloride ion, violates the principle of microscopic reversibility and thus demonstrates that the channel-gating process is not at thermodynamic equilibrium. The results imply that the channel's conformational states are coupled to the transmembrane electrochemical gradient of the chloride ion."
https://openalex.org/W1976148134,"We have found that interleukin 3 (IL-3), a growth factor for hematopoietic cells, is a novel trophic factor for mouse and rat central cholinergic neurons. It enhanced neurite outgrowth and elevated choline acetyltransferase activity. The effect seems to be specific for cholinergic neurons, since somatostatin release and glutamic acid decarboxylase and 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase activities were not significantly influenced by IL-3. In vivo, IL-3 was infused into the lateral ventricles of rats after unilateral axotomy of the septohippocampal pathways. Two weeks later, the IL-3-treated animals showed significant numbers of acetylcholinesterase-positive neurons remaining in the septal region."
https://openalex.org/W2072699256,"To understand better the similarities and differences between meiosis and mitosis, we examined the meiotic role of DNA topoisomerase II, an enzyme that is required mitotically to disentangle sister chromatids at the time of chromosome segregation. In meiosis, we found that topoisomerase II is required only at the time of nuclear division. When cold-sensitive top2 mutants are induced to sporulate at the restrictive temperature, they undergo premeiotic DNA synthesis and commitment to meiotic levels of recombination but fail to complete the first meiotic nuclear division. The introduction of a mutation blocking recombination relieves the requirement for topoisomerase II in meiosis I. These results suggest that topoisomerase II is required at the time of chromosome segregation in meiosis I for the resolution of recombined chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2028960428,"In Drosophila melanogaster males, the sex chromosomes pair during meiosis in the centric X heterochromatin and at the base of the short arm of the Y (YS), in the vicinity of the nucleolus organizers. X chromosomes deficient for the pairing region segregate randomly from the Y. In this report we show that a single ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene stimulates X-Y pairing and disjunction when inserted onto a heterochromatically deficient X chromosome by P element-mediated transformation. We also show that insert-containing X chromosomes pair at the site of insertion, that autosomal rDNA inserts do not affect X-Y pairing or disjunction, and that the strength of an X pairing site is proportional to the dose of ectopic rRNA genes. These results demonstrate that rRNA genes can promote X-Y pairing and disjunction and imply that the nucleolus organizers function as X-Y pairing sites in wild-type Drosophila males."
https://openalex.org/W1492673645,"Whereas bacteria such as Escherichia coli have been known for some time to cleave carbon-phosphorus (C-P) bonds in unactivated alkylphosphonates, the enzymes responsible for C-P lyase activity have resisted detection or purification. Genes from E. coli B that support growth on alkylphosphonates as the sole phosphorus source have now been cloned (B. L. Wanner and J. A. Boline, unpublished data). Deletion analysis demonstrated that at least 13 kilobases of DNA information is required for E. coli to express the phosphonate utilization phenotype (Phn+). The complete nucleotide sequence of 15,611 bases has been determined, and the gene structures were examined. Seventeen open reading frames (phnA to phnQ) were identified in one transcriptional direction and five open reading frames in the divergent direction. Sequence homology searches identify PhnC, PhnK, PhnL, and, possibly, PhnN proteins as members of nucleotide-binding proteins of the binding protein-dependent transport systems. Candidates for other membrane components and regulatory proteins are also identified. A Pho box-like promoter sequence is also found upstream of the gene cluster starting at phnA, which is consistent with the observation of phosphate regulation of the Phn+ response. Fourteen repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences are found in the phn DNA: 10 exist in the extragenic region between phnA and phnB, two between phnD and phnE, and two between phnK and phnL. An unusual finding is that one of the repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences actually overlaps with the reading frame of the phnE gene."
https://openalex.org/W2089269522,"The T cell antigen receptor (TCR) delta gene is located within the TCR alpha locus. A T cell-specific transcriptional enhancer, distinct from the TCR alpha enhancer, has been identified within the J delta 3-C delta intron of the human T cell receptor delta gene. This enhancer activates transcription from the V delta 1 and V delta 3 promoters as well as from heterologous promoters. Enhancer activity has been localized to a 250-bp region that contains multiple binding sites for nuclear proteins. Thus, transcriptional control of the TCR delta and TCR alpha genes is mediated by distinct regulatory elements."
https://openalex.org/W2030779540,"We have studied the expression of NGF receptor (NGFR) mRNA in the mouse trigeminal system at closely staged intervals throughout development. The level of NGFR mRNA per neuron is at a constant low level before the earliest axons reach the target field and increases 5-fold to plateau shortly after the arrival of the last axons. NGFR mRNA expression in developing target skin is restricted to mesenchyme, precedes the arrival of the earliest axons, and increases throughout the phase of target field innervation. These findings suggest that NGFR expression on sensory neurons occurs at a low level prior to target field innervation and is up-regulated with this event, and they raise the possibility that NGFRs on mesenchymal cells restrict the distribution of NGF in the target field."
https://openalex.org/W1516537445,"The INO4 gene product is believed to be a positive regulatory factor in a complex cascade of positive and negative factors that coordinates the synthesis of phospholipids in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mutations at the INO4 locus result in a decrease in phosphatidylcholine synthesis and an inability to derepress the structural genes for inositol-1-phosphate synthase and phosphatidylserine synthase. In the present study, the transcript encoding the INO4 gene product has been identified and a transcription map of the INO4 region has been constructed. An ino4 deletion mutant was constructed by in vitro gene disruption and the deletion mutant was shown to be viable but auxotrophic for inositol. The deletion mutant expressed repressed levels of inositol-1-phosphate synthase (INO1) mRNA and exhibited reduced phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, a phenotype similar to previously characterized ino4 mutants. The INO4 gene has been mapped to chromosome 15 and is tightly linked to the SUF1 tRNA gene. Translation of the DNA sequence of the INO4 gene results in a very basic protein of molecular weight 17,378. Computer analysis of the INO4 protein sequence identified several potential phosphorylation sites as well as several regions that contained significant similarities with the lupus LA antigen and with the helix-loop-helix region of the Myc family of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1602055538,"Several staphylococcal plasmids from different incompatibility (inc) groups which replicate by a rolling circle mechanism each specify a replication initiator protein (Rep) which is homologous with that of the inc3 tetracycline resistance plasmid pT181. The rep gene sequences of six pT181-like plasmids are known, each encoding proteins of molecular mass 38 kDa with 62% overall amino acid sequence identity. The initiation of replication in vivo by each of the Rep proteins is plasmid specific, acting in trans only at the cognate replication origin (ori) of the encoding plasmid. Previous studies in vitro of the RepC protein of pT181 demonstrated replication initiator, topoisomerase-like, and DNA binding activities, which appeared to be specific for the origin (oriC) of pT181 when compared with unrelated staphylococcal plasmids. Although RepD, specified by the inc4 chloramphenicol resistance plasmid pC221, has a range of activities similar to those noted previously for RepC, manipulation of in vitro conditions has revealed discrete steps in the overall reaction of RepD with oriD. In addition, factors have been identified which are necessary not only for sequence-dependent discrimination in vitro by Rep proteins for all pT181-like plasmids but also for the absolute specificity of RepD for its cognate pC221 replication origin (oriD), the latter occurring in vivo and a function of the topological state of the ori-containing target DNA. Here we also demonstrate the presence of a covalent phosphoryl-tyrosine linkage between the RepD protein of plasmid pC221 and an oligonucleotide substrate corresponding to its replication origin (oriD). The reactive tyrosine (Tyr-188) was identified from amino acid sequences of 32P-labeled peptide-oligonucleotide fragments. Substitution of Tyr-188 with phenylalanine confirms the importance of the tyrosyl hydroxyl group since the Y188F protein retains the sequence-specific DNA-binding capabilities of wild-type RepD but is unable to attach covalently to the replication origin or participate in the nicking-closing reaction in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1803972806,"The mechanism by which cells increase their rate of glucose uptake in response to stress is unclear. Using an immunofluorescence technique to localize the glucose transporter protein in BHK cells, we found that hyperthermia, treatment with arsenite, infection with vesicular stomatitis virus or Semliki Forest virus, and treatment with insulin cause the transporter to move from an intracellular site in the perinuclear region to the plasma membrane; the degree of translocation correlates approximately with the increase in glucose uptake. We conclude that stress induces an insulin-like distribution of certain membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1525331343,"The cytochrome bo quinol oxidase of Escherichia coli is one of two respiratory O2 reductases which the bacterium synthesizes. The enzyme complex contains copper and 2 mol of b-type heme. Electron paramagnetic resonance (epr) spectroscopy of membranes from a strain having amplified levels of this enzyme complex reveals signals from low- and high-spin b-type hemes, but the copper, now established as a component of the oxidase, is not directly detectable by epr. The high-spin signal from the cytochrome bo complex, which we attribute to cytochrome o, when titrated potentiometrically, gives a bell-shaped curve. The low potential side of this curve is biphasic (Em7 approximately 180 and 280 mV) and corresponds to the reduction/oxidation of the cytochrome(s). The high potential side of the bell-shaped curve is monophasic (Em7 approximately 370 mV) and is proposed to be due to reduction/oxidation of a copper center which, when in the Cu(II) form, is tightly spin-coupled to a heme, probably cytochrome o, resulting in a net even spin system and loss of the epr spectrum. The low-spin cytochrome b titrates biphasically with Em7 values of approximately 180 and 280 mV, similar to the high-spin component but without the loss of signal at high potentials."

https://openalex.org/W1547009771,"Ascorbic acid is known to stimulate leukocyte functions. In a recent publication it was suggested that the role of ascorbic acid is to reduce compound II of myeloperoxidase back to the native enzyme (Bolscher, B. G. J. M., Zoutberg, G. R., Cuperus, R. A., and Wever, R. (1984) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 784, 189-191). In this paper we report rapid spectral scan and transient state kinetic results on the reaction of three myeloperoxidase compounds II, namely, human neutrophil myeloperoxidase, canine myeloperoxidase, and bovine spleen heme protein with ascorbate. We show by rapid scan spectra that compound II does not pass through any other intermediate when ascorbic acid reduces it back to native form. We also show that the reactions of all three compounds II involve a simple binding interaction before enzyme reduction with an apparent dissociation constant of 6.3 +/- 0.9 x 10(-4) to 2.0 +/- 0.3 x 10(-3)M and a first-order rate constant for reduction of 12.6 +/- 0.6 to 18.8 +/- 1.3 s-1. The optimum pH is 4.5, and at this pH the activation energy for the reaction is 13.2 kJ mol-1. Results of this work lend further evidence that the spleen green heme protein is very similar if not identical to leukocyte myeloperoxidase based on a comparison of spectral scans, pH-rate profiles, and kinetic parameters. We demonstrate that chloride cannot reduce compound II whereas iodide reduces compound II to native enzyme at a rate comparable to that of ascorbate. This explains why ascorbate accelerates chlorination but inhibits iodination. Formation of compound II is a dead end for the generation of hypochlorous acid; ascorbate regenerates more native enzyme to enhance the chlorination reaction namely: myeloperoxidase + peroxide----compound I followed by compound I + chloride----HOCl. On the other hand, ascorbate is a competitor with iodide for both compounds I and II and so inhibits iodination."
https://openalex.org/W1508994631,"The environmental contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin produces its biological effects by binding to an intracellular protein, the Ah receptor. The liganded receptor activates transcription by binding to a specific recognition motif within a dioxin-responsive enhancer upstream of the target CYP1A1 gene. Here, we have used gel retardation to analyze the interaction between the liganded Ah receptor and five circularly permuted DNA fragments that contain a receptor recognition motif. Our findings indicate that the binding of the liganded receptor to its recognition motif bends the DNA at (or near) the site of the protein-DNA interaction. This observation implies that Ah receptor-induced DNA distortion may contribute to the activation of CYP1A1 transcription by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin."
https://openalex.org/W1548733939,"The metabolism and intracellular distribution of a fluorescent analog of phosphatidylinositol (PI), 1,2-[oleoyl,N-(6-[(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazo-4-yl) aminocaproyl)]-PI (C6-NBD-PI), was examined in monolayer cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells following its insertion into the plasma membrane. Evidence is presented that the exogenously supplied C6-NBD-PI was hydrolyzed by a calcium-dependent PI-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) at the external cell surface and that this PI-specific phospholipase C may play a role in the density-dependent inhibition of cell growth: (i) When confluent monolayer cultures were incubated with C6-NBD-PI for 60 min at 7 degrees C, the lipid spontaneously transferred to the cells, and prominent labeling of intracellular membranes was observed. Lipid extraction and analysis demonstrated that more than 60% of the fluorescent lipid in these cells was fluorescent diacylglycerol (DAG). However, when the corresponding fluorescent analogs of phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine were used, the fluorescent lipids readily transferred to cells, but no hydrolysis to fluorescent DAG occurred. (ii) Both intracellular labeling and hydrolysis of C6-NBD-PI to -DAG were inhibited in the presence of [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid. (iii) When myo-[2-3H]inositol-labeled C6-NBD-PI was incubated with cells, [3H]inositol phosphate was released into the incubation medium, but no water-soluble 3H-labeled products were found associated with the cells. (iv) The level of C6-NBD-PI hydrolysis increased dramatically with increasing density of 3T3 cells in monolayer culture."
https://openalex.org/W1575995496,"Abstract The folding of in vitro synthesized outer membrane protein PhoE of Escherichia coli was studied in immunoprecipitation experiments with monoclonal antibodies which recognize cell surface-exposed conformational epitopes. The signal sequence appears to interfere with the formation of these conformational epitopes, since a mutant PhoE protein which lacks the majority of the signal peptide could be precipitated four times better than the wild type precursor. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitated PhoE protein revealed that part of the immunoprecipitated PhoE was present as a heat-modifiable form of the protein which migrated faster in the gels than the completely denatured protein. This form of the protein probably represents a folded monomer which might be an intermediate in the assembly of the protein. Outer membrane vesicles were required to induce the formation of small amounts of heat-stable trimers, the functional form of the protein in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1560184756,"Reductions in cardiac vagal tone have been shown to correlate with increased susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation (VF). If these reductions in vagal tone contribute to VF, one would predict that interventions that increase vagal tone should protect against these lethal arrhythmias. Therefore, VF was induced in 17 mongrel dogs with healed myocardial infarctions by a 2-min coronary occlusion during exercise. On a subsequent day, the cholinergic agonist carbachol (20 micrograms/kg, i.v.) was given before the exercise plus ischemia test (n = 14). Carbachol elicited significant reductions in heart rate (control 204.5 +/- 27.7 vs. carbachol 147.0 +/- 49.6 beats/min) and prevented VF in 11 of 14 animals. When the decline in heart rate was prevented by ventricular pacing, carbachol prevented VF in five of six animals. Cyclic GMP may act as an intracellular messenger of cholinergic activation; therefore, 8-bromo cyclic GMP (n = 9) was infused (100-150 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, i.v.) throughout the exercise beginning 45 min before onset of exercise. Heart rate increased but VF was prevented in eight of nine animals. Similar results were noted for dibutyryl cyclic GMP (n = 5). These data suggest that cholinergic agonists and cyclic GMP can prevent VF in susceptible animals independently of heart rate changes."
https://openalex.org/W2084431127,"Transgenic mice carrying multiple copies of the human NGF receptor gene have been generated. Using a monoclonal antibody specific for the human receptor, we have detected specific expression in cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum during the postnatal period. Expression in the PNS was exemplified by immunostaining of sympathetic and sensory neurons during an early embryonic age. Transection of the sciatic nerve in transgenic animals resulted in induction of human NGF receptors, indicating that the inserted gene can be appropriately regulated. These transgenic mice will provide an opportunity to study the elements regulating the NGF receptor. Furthermore, the ability to obtain specific expression in transgenic mice will permit directed expression of heterologous genes in discrete cells important in the cholinergic septal-hippocampal pathway and the PNS."
https://openalex.org/W1513248605,"To obtain the large quantities of the extracellular domain of the nerve growth factor receptor (NGF-R) necessary for structural analyses, we produced this protein in the baculovirus expression system. A cDNA coding for the extracellular domain of the human NGF-R was first introduced into transfer vector pVL941. Recombinant baculovirus was produced by cotransfecting Spodoptera frugiperda cells with the transfer vector and DNA of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus. Recombinant viral plaques were selected by morphology and dot hybridization. The expression of recombinant extracellular domain (RED) was analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-NGF-R monoclonal antibody. Insect cells infected with recombinant virus synthesized RED and secreted it into the culture supernatant. RED was isolated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, immunoaffinity chromatography, and anion exchange chromatography yielding 4 mg of RED/liter of suspension culture. Since there was no apparent effect of endoglycosidase H or F on RED electrophoretic mobility, and since RED did not bind concanavalin A or soybean lectin, there appears to be little or no glycosylation of RED. Purified RED bound 125I-NGF as well as anti-NGF-R monoclonal antibodies. Sedimentation analysis and gel exclusion chromatography revealed that RED is an asymmetric molecule and may be a dimer."
https://openalex.org/W1518782573,"Enveloped animal viruses enter host cells either by direct fusion at neutral pH or by endocytosis. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is believed to fuse with the plasma membrane of cells at neutral pH, and the glycoproteins gB and gD have been implicated in virus entry and cell fusion. Using cloned gB or gD genes, we show that cells expressing HSV-1 glycoproteins gB or gD can undergo fusion to form polykaryons by exposure only to acidic pH. The low pH-induced cell fusion was blocked in the presence of monoclonal antibodies specific to the glycoproteins. Infection of cells expressing gB or gD glycoproteins with HSV-1 inhibited the low pH-induced cell fusion. The results suggest that although the glycoproteins gB and gD possess fusogenic activity at acidic pH, other HSV proteins may regulate it such that in the virus-infected cell, this fusion activity is blocked."
https://openalex.org/W1491999703,"Liquid chromatographic procedures have been developed for rapidly locating the site of reaction of chemical modification reagents with Salmonella typhimurium 5-phosphoribosyl-alpha-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase. The enzyme was reacted with the active site-directed reagent 5'-(p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl)adenosine (FSBA). FSBA bound to the enzyme with an apparent KD of 1.7 +/- 0.4 mM. The enzyme was inactivated during the reaction, and a limiting stoichiometry of 1.2 mol of FSBA/mol of enzyme subunit corresponded to complete inactivation. Inclusion of ATP in the reaction protected the enzyme from inactivation and incorporation of the reagent. Inclusion of ribose 5-phosphate increased the rate of reaction of PRPP synthetase with FSBA. Amino acid analyses of acid hydrolysates of modified enzyme failed to detect any known FSBA-amino acid adducts. Tryptic digestion of 5'-(p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl)-[3H]adenosine-modified enzyme at pH 7.0 yielded a single radioactive peptide. The peptide, TR-1, was subjected to combined V8 and Asp-N protease digestion, and a single radioactive peptide was isolated. This radioactive peptide yielded the sequence Asp-Leu-His-Ala-Glu, which corresponded to amino acid residues 128-132 in S. typhimurium PRPP synthetase. No radioactivity was associated with any of the phenylthiohydantoin-amino acid fractions, all of which were recovered in good yield. A majority of the radioactivity was found in the waste effluent (64%) and on the glass fiber filter loaded into the sequenator (23%). The lability of the modification and the sequence of this peptide indicate His130 as the site of reaction with FSBA."
https://openalex.org/W1593293529,"Stimulation of the human T cell line, Jurkat, by the addition of monoclonal antibodies reactive with the T cell antigen receptor complex (CD3/Ti) leads to sustained increases in levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. To investigate the possibility that the production of polyphosphoinositides is regulated during CD3/Ti stimulation, we studied Jurkat cells whose inositol phospholipids had been labeled to steady state with [3H]inositol, as well as Jurkat cells during nonequilibrium labeling with [32P]orthophosphate. The addition of CD3 monoclonal antibodies led to a 4-5-fold increase in [3H]inositol trisphosphate that was sustained for greater than 20 min. Within 60 s of CD3/Ti stimulation, [3H] phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) and [3H]phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) decreased by 65 and 35%, respectively. This change in [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 persisted for greater than 20 min. The decrease in [3H]PtdIns4P, however, was transient, and, after 5 min, the levels of [3H]PtdIns4P were comparable in stimulated and unstimulated cells. To examine the rate of flux through inositol phospholipids, we measured the CD3/Ti-stimulated changes in the ratio, 32P cpm/3H cpm, in each inositol phospholipid. CD3/Ti stimulation led to accelerated fluxes through PtdIns(4,5)P2 and phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) that were maintained for greater than 20 min. After the initial 30 s, however, there was no detectable effect of anti-CD3 on flux through Ptsins4p. This observation suggested that, during CD3/Ti stimulation, production of PtdIns(4,5)P2 from PtdIns might occur via a small pool of PtdIns4P with a very high turnover. The existence of such a pool was established by determining that, in stimulated cells, the 32P-specific activity of the 1-position phosphate of PtdIns(4,5)P2 was 8-10-fold that of PtdIns4P. We conclude that, during the initial 60 s of CD3/Ti stimulation, there is a substantial depletion of cellular PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns4P. Thereafter, a CD3/Ti-regulated pathway generates PtdIns(4,5)P2 from PtdIns through a small, but highly labile, pool of PtdIns4P."
https://openalex.org/W1489651872,"The S1 subunit (Mr 28,000) of pertussis toxin expresses thiol-dependent enzymatic ADP-ribosyltransferase and NAD-glycohydrolase activities. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments were performed on the codon for Cys-41 of this subunit to investigate the role of this residue in both enzymatic activities. Deletion of Cys-41 caused a decrease in both activities below detectable levels, whereas replacement of this residue by serine, glycine, proline, or asparagine only slightly reduced the activities. The enzymatic activities of these mutants were thiol-independent. The deletion of Ser-40, adjacent to Cys-41, again caused reduction of the enzymatic activities to undetectable levels. Steady-state kinetic experiments showed that the kcat of the mutant protein in which Cys-41 was replaced by glycine was nearly identical to the kcat of the parent version. However, the Km for NAD of the mutant was significantly higher relative to that of the wild type version. These results indicate that the side-chain of Cys-41 is not essential for enzymatic activities and that Cys-41 is not involved in the rate of catalysis but is probably located at or close to the NAD-binding site. The introduction of a negative charge at position 41 through the replacement of Cys-41 by either aspartate or glutamate reduced the enzymatic activities to very low but measurable levels, suggesting a charge-charge repulsive interaction between these residues and possibly one or both of the phosphates of NAD. Cys-41 may therefore be located close to the phosphate subsite of the NAD-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1504047855,"As an approach to isolate the cell-surface receptor for tumor necrosis factor (TNF), we have developed transfectants of human B-lymphoblastoid cells (UC cells) that overexpress the TNF receptor. These transfectants were isolated from UC cells transfected with cDNA libraries of HeLa or NG108 cells constructed in the mammalian expression vector EBO-pcD. This vector contains the Epstein-Barr virus origin of replication (ori-P) plus the EBNA-1 gene conferring replication function to ori-P and, therefore, the ability to replicate autonomously within the transfected cell (Margolskee, R.F., Kavathas, P., and Berg, P. (1988) Mol. Cell. Biol. 8, 2837-2947). Cells overexpressing the TNF receptor were identified and separated by the binding of fluoresceinated TNF and flow cytometric selection. Scatchard analysis of 125I-TNF binding data revealed a single class of high affinity receptors with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.2 to 2 nM and a receptor density of about 150,000 per cell, an increase of approximately 150-fold over UC cells. Cross-linking of receptor-ligand with bis-sulfosuccinimidyl suberate followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave estimates of 87 and 104 kDa for the size of the complex. Based on its ability to bind TNF, a 68-kDa receptor protein was identified in cell extracts enriched for the receptor by using immobilized wheat germ agglutinin and TNF affinity chromatography. The difference in the estimated size of the receptor and the receptor-ligand complexes demonstrates that TNF binds to the receptor as a monomer or a dimer. Analysis of cDNA sequences conferring receptor amplification in transfectants revealed that plasmid DNA was present at 30 or more copies per cell, most likely integrated into the genomic DNA or organized into high molecular weight catenanes, and autonomously replicating units could not be recovered. Therefore, while this vector was useful in generating stable receptor-amplified cells, it was not maintained as a recoverable episome."
https://openalex.org/W190195948,"The properties of calcium-stimulated ATP hydrolysis often differ from those of ATP-dependent calcium transport. We have characterized two components of calcium-stimulated ATP hydrolysis in human placental basal plasma membrane. In the absence of magnesium, component 1 apparently has saturable sites for free calcium in both the nanomolar and low micromolar range. It was stimulated by either calcium or magnesium, was unselective for nucleotide substrate, and its activity was very much greater than that of ATP-dependent calcium transport. Component 1 was inhibited by GTP, permitting measurement of component 2 with activity and magnesium stimulation comparable to ATP-dependent calcium transport. Component 2 was inhibited partially by an antibody against purified erythrocyte calcium transporter and completely by sulfhydryl reagents, whereas component 1 was unaffected. A phosphorylated intermediate of the calcium transporter co-migrated with the erythrocyte transporter on acidic sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels. Immunostaining after transfer to nitrocellulose revealed a doublet. The band of lower molecular weight co-migrated with that of the human erythrocyte membrane transporter. The addition of GTP permits separate measurement of ATP hydrolysis by the calcium transporter of the placental basal plasma membrane and may be useful in defining its properties in other cell membranes under a variety of conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1929949037,"It is demonstrated that human IgG in Chagas' disease and the corresponding F(ab)‘2 fragment attach to lymphoid cells by specific interaction with β-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors. This interaction resulted in the transduction of signals that increased intracellular levels of cAMP in enriched T helper cell preparations and cGMP in enriched T suppressor cell preparations. The stimulation of Ts cell muscarinic cholinergic receptors by Chagas IgG or the corresponding F(ab)‘2 fraction triggers the release of the immunomodulatory substance PGE2. These results are unified in a theory of immunoregulation and could contribute to the chronic course of Chagas' disease.—Sterin-Borda, L.; Gorelik, G., Genaro, A.; Goin, J. C., Borda, E. S.

https://openalex.org/W1513595060,"The essential interactions between cAMP and the yeast low Km cAMP-phosphodiesterase have been analyzed using cAMP analogues and phosphodiesterase inhibitors. cAMP specificity is conferred by hydrogen bonding at the N-6 and N-7 positions. In contrast to the other yeast phosphodiesterase, (Rp)-adenosine 3',5'-monophosphorothioate is not hydrolyzed. Eleven standard phosphodiesterase inhibitors were not highly effective. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that express the yeast cAMP-phosphodiesterase (PDE2) gene, cAMP levels cannot be raised by cholera toxin. cAMP analogues that are efficiently hydrolyzed by the yeast cAMP-phosphodiesterase had no effect on the growth of CHO cells that express the PDE2 gene, even though they block the growth and alter the morphology of control cells. cAMP analogues that are not hydrolyzed by the yeast enzyme inhibited the growth and changed the morphology of both control and PDE2 expressing CHO cells. We have developed a method for creating cell lines in which cAMP levels can be reduced by expression of an exogenous cAMP-phosphodiesterase gene. By employing cAMP analogues that are not hydrolyzed by this phosphodiesterase, the inhibitory effects of the enzyme can be bypassed."
https://openalex.org/W1483854933,"Earlier studies on LLC-PK1 cells have demonstrated two pharmacologically distinct Na+/H+ exchangers in renal epithelia. In addition, the cDNA clone for the human Na+/H+ antiporter which is growth factor activatable has been isolated and expressed (Sardet, C., Franchi, A., and Pouyssegur, J. (1989) Cell 56, 271-280). We report here the synthesis of an amiloride analogue that can be photoactivated and labeled with 125I. This analogue covalently cross-links a 66-kDa protein of bovine renal brush border membranes. A rabbit polyclonal antibody that was directed against a 20-amino acid peptide of the cytoplasmic domain of its human Na+/H+ antiporter also gives a positive Western against 66-kDa protein of bovine brush border membranes. Thus, the photoactive probe may be helpful in the isolation and purification of the brush border Na+/H+ exchanger."
https://openalex.org/W1547622152,"The kinetics of electron transfer between cytochrome-c oxidase and ruthenium hexamine has been characterized using the native enzyme or its cyanide complex either solubilized by detergent (soluble cytochrome oxidase) or reconstituted into artificial phospholipid vesicles (cytochrome oxidase-containing vesicles). Ru(NH3)2+6 (Ru(II] reduces oxidized cytochrome a, following (by-and-large) bimolecular kinetics; the second order rate constant using the cyanide complex of the enzyme is 1.5 x 10(6) M-1 s-1, for the enzyme in detergent, and slightly higher for COV. In the case of COV the kinetics are not affected by the addition of ionophores. Upon mixing fully reduced cytochrome oxidase with oxygen (in the presence of excess reductants), the oxidation leading to the pulsed enzyme is followed by a steady state phase and (eventually) by complete re-reduction. When the concentrations of dioxygen and oxidase are sufficiently low (micromolar range), the time course of oxidation can be resolved by stopped flow at room temperature, yielding an apparent bimolecular rate constant of 5 x 10(7) M-1 s-1. After exhaustion of oxygen and end of steady state, re-reduction of the pulsed enzyme by the excess Ru(II) is observed; the concentration dependence shows that the rate of re-reduction is limited at 3 s-1 in detergent; this limiting value is assigned to the intramolecular electron transfer process from cytochrome a-Cua to the binuclear center. Using the reconstituted enzyme, the internal electron transfer step is sensitive to ionophores, increasing from 2-3 to 7-8 s-1 upon addition of valinomycin and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. This finding indicates for the first time an effect of the electrochemical potential across the membrane on the internal electron transfer rate; the results are compared with expectations based on the hypothesis formulated by Brunori et al. (Brunori, M., Sarti, P., Colosimo, A., Antonini, G., Malatesta, F., Jones, M.G., and Wilson, M.T. (1985) EMBO J. 4, 2365-2368), and their bioenergetic relevance is discussed with reference to the proton pumping activity of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1528508167,"fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP) receptors were functionally reconstituted into Xenopus laevis oocytes by microinjection with RNA isolated from promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) differentiated with 750 microM N6, O2-dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. fMLP-induced Ca2+ mobilization was monitored by measurement of photon emission elicited by aequorin coinjected with RNA into albino X. laevis oocytes. Maximal expression of the fMLP receptor was achieved 48 h after microinjection of RNA. Dose-response experiments revealed a K0.5 of 9.5 nM fMLP which is in good agreement with the dissociation constants of the fMLP receptor complex in human neutrophils. Furthermore, the fMLP-induced Ca2+ mobilization in Xenopus oocytes was blocked by the fMLP receptor inhibitor t-butoxycarbonyl-Met-Leu-Phe. Size fractionation of the RNA and microinjection of the individual fractions indicated that messenger RNA for the fMLP receptor is between 1.5 and 2.0 kilobases. Reconstitution of the fMLP receptor into Xenopus oocytes can be employed to isolate the cDNA encoding the fMLP receptor as well as to study the regulation of the fMLP receptor in a functional system."

https://openalex.org/W1648550563,"A class of inositol phosphate-containing oligosaccharides (IPG) derived from a membrane glycan-phosphatidylinositol precursor (GPI) has been identified as a possible mediator of insulin action. Saltiel's laboratory has recently communicated an in vitro assay for the synthesis of GPI in rat liver microsomes. Herein we have established this method in rat and human liver microsomes, it being our end point to evaluate if the pool of GPI was normal in diabetes and if failure of insulin to generate IPG from GPI could be involved in the mechanism of insulin resistance in Type II diabetes. However, subsequent to the detailed study of [3H]myoinositol incorporation into phospholipids in liver microsomes from our study subjects, we demonstrated by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis that the material reported to be GPI is a mixture of lysophospholipids that does not contain hexosamine, ethanolamine, or amino acids."
