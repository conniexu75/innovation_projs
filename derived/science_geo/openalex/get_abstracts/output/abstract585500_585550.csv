https://openalex.org/W2609833236,"The sense of agency (SA) is an established framework that refers to our ability to exert and perceive control over our own actions. Having an intact SA provides the basis for the human perception of voluntariness, while impairments in SA are hypothesized to lead to the perception of movements being involuntary that may be seen many neurological or psychiatric disorders. Individuals with functional movement disorders (FMD) experience a lack of control over their movements, yet these movements appear voluntary by physiology. We used fMRI to explore whether alterations in SA in an FMD population could explain why these patients feel their movements are involuntary. We compared the FMD group to a control group that was previously collected using an ecologically valid, virtual-reality movement paradigm that could modulate SA. We found selective dysfunction of the SA neural network, whereby the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and pre-supplementary motor area on the right did not respond differentially to the loss of movement control. These findings provide some of the strongest evidence to date for a physiological basis underlying these disabling disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2609007932,"Context Obesity in men is associated with low serum testosterone and both are associated with several diseases and increased mortality. Objectives Examine the direction and causality of the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and serum testosterone. Design Bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis on prospective cohorts. Setting Five cohorts from Denmark, Germany and Sweden (Inter99, SHIP, SHIP Trend, GOOD and MrOS Sweden). Participants 7446 Caucasian men, genotyped for 97 BMI-associated SNPs and three testosterone-associated SNPs. Main outcome measures BMI and serum testosterone adjusted for age, smoking, time of blood sampling and site. Results 1 SD genetically instrumented increase in BMI was associated with a 0.25 SD decrease in serum testosterone (IV ratio: -0.25, 95% CI: -0.42–-0.09, p = 2.8*10−3). For a body weight reduction altering the BMI from 30 to 25 kg/m2, the effect would equal a 13% increase in serum testosterone. No association was seen for genetically instrumented testosterone with BMI, a finding that was confirmed using large-scale data from the GIANT consortium (n = 104349). Conclusions Our results suggest that there is a causal effect of BMI on serum testosterone in men. Population level interventions to reduce BMI are expected to increase serum testosterone in men."
https://openalex.org/W2607899596,"The aim of this study was to assess differences in fundamental motor skills (FMS) proficiency between boys and girls of each age group, independently, across the entire preschool period. Using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children–second edition, FMS proficiency was tested in 325 preschoolers (4.9 ± 1.1 y, range 3–6) using a cross-sectional design. Compared to boys of the same age, 3- and 4-year-old girls had greater total (p < .01), fine motor skill (p < .01), and balance scores (p < .05). There were no sex differences for total test or balance scores in 5- and 6-year-olds, but 6-year-old boys outperformed girls in aiming and catching (p < .001). These data not only agree with previous research in that sex differences in FMS proficiency exist in preschool children, but the data also show that differences may not be uniform throughout the whole preschool period when analyzing by age. To avoid under- or overestimating FMS proficiency and subsequently prescribing inaccurate motor intervention programs, FMS proficiency normative values should be age- and sex-specific throughout the entire preschool period."
https://openalex.org/W2607894244,"To investigate factors associated with ocular axial elongation and myopia progression during a 4-year follow-up in primary school children in Beijing.This school-based study included 382 grade-1 children at baseline in 2011 (age:6.3±0.4 years) with 305 (79.8%) returning for the follow-up examination in 2015. At baseline and in yearly follow-up examinations, the children underwent a comprehensive eye examination including auto-refractometry, ocular biometry with measurement of axial length, and fundus photography. The parents underwent a standardized interview.During the study period, the mean axial length elongated by 1.15±0.56mm in boys and 1.10±0.63mm in girls. At baseline and at the end of follow-up, axial length was significantly (P<0.001) longer in boys, with no difference (P = 0.50) between genders in axial elongation. In multivariate analysis, greater axial elongation was associated (regression coefficient r2:0.15) with less time spent outdoors (P = 0.004; standardized coefficient beta: -0.22), more time spent indoors with studying (P = 0.02; beta: 0.18) and paternal myopia (P = 0.03; beta: 0.16). Larger increases in the axial length/anterior corneal curvature (AL/CC) ratio were associated (r2:0.09) with less time spent outdoors (PP = 0.003; beta: -0.22) and maternal myopia (PP = 0.02; beta: 0.18).Myopic axial elongation during a 4-year follow-up was associated with shorter time spent outdoors and longer time spent indoors studying and with parental myopia. Other factors such as level of paternal education, family income, gender and region of habitation were significantly associated with axial elongation and with myopia progression only in univariate analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2608966349,"Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is widely used among the breast cancer patients in Malaysia. Delays in presentation, diagnosis and treatment have been shown to impact the disease prognosis. There is considerable use of CAM amongst breast cancer patients. CAM use has been cited as a cause of delay in diagnosis and treatments in qualitative studies, however there had not been any confirmatory study that confirms its impact on delays. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the use of CAM among newly diagnosed breast cancer patients was associated with delays in presentation, diagnosis or treatment of breast cancer. This multi-centre cross-sectional study evaluating the time points of the individual breast cancer patients' journey from first visit, resolution of diagnosis and treatments was conducted in six public hospitals in Malaysia. All newly diagnosed breast cancer patients from 1st January to 31st December 2012 were recruited. Data were collected through medical records review and patient interview by using a structured questionnaire. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) was defined as the use of any methods and products not included in conventional allopathic medicine before commencement of treatments. Presentation delay was defined as time taken from symptom discovery to first presentation of more than 3 months. The time points were categorised to diagnosis delay was defined as time taken from first presentation to diagnosis of more than 1 month and treatment delay was defined as time taken from diagnosis to initial treatment of more than 1 month. Multiple logistic regression was used for analysis. A total number of 340 patients participated in this study. The prevalence of CAM use was 46.5% (n = 158). Malay ethnicity (OR 3.32; 95% CI: 1.85, 5.97) and not interpreting symptom as cancerous (OR 1.79; 95% CI: 1.10, 2.92) were significantly associated with CAM use. The use of CAM was associated with delays in presentation (OR 1.65; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.59), diagnosis (OR 2.42; 95% CI: 1.56, 3.77) and treatment of breast cancer (OR 1.74; 95% CI: 1.11, 2.72) on univariate analyses. However, after adjusting with other covariates, CAM use was associated with delays in presentation (OR 1.71; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.78) and diagnosis (OR 2.58; 95% CI: 1.59, 4.17) but not for treatment of breast cancer (OR 1.58; 95% CI: 0.98, 2.55). The prevalence of CAM use among the breast cancer patients was high. Women of Malay ethnicity and not interpreting symptom as cancerous were significantly associated with CAM use. The use of CAM is significantly associated with delay in presentation and resolution of diagnosis. This study suggests further evaluation of access to breast cancer care is needed as poor access may cause the use of CAM. However, since public hospitals in Malaysia are heavily subsidized and readily available to the population, CAM use may impact delays in presentation and diagnosis."

In this study we aimed to investigate the accuracy of Timed Up and Go test, for fallers’ identification, using fusion of features extracted from accelerometer data. Single and dual tasks TUG (manual and cognitive) were performed by a final sample (94% power) of 36 community dwelling healthy older persons (18 fallers paired with 18 non-fallers) while they wear a single triaxial accelerometer at waist with sampling rate of 200Hz. The segmentation of the TUG different trials and its comparative analysis allows to better discriminate fallers from non-fallers, while conventional functional tests fail to do so. In addition, we show that the fusion of features improve the discrimination power, achieving AUC of 0.84 (Sensitivity = Specificity = 0.83, 95% CI 0.62-0.91), and demonstrating the clinical relevance of the study. We concluded that features extracted from segmented TUG trials acquired with dual tasks has potential to improve performance when identifying fallers via accelerometer sensors, which can improve TUG accuracy for clinical and epidemiological applications."
https://openalex.org/W2608240479,"A wide search for ischemic preconditioning (IPC) mechanisms of cardioprotection identified the light elicited circadian rhythm protein Period 2 (Per2) to be cardioprotective. Studies on cardiac metabolism found a key role for light elicited Per2 in mediating metabolic dependence on carbohydrate metabolism. To profile Per2 mediated pathways following IPC of the mouse heart, we performed a genome array and identified 352 abundantly expressed and well-characterized Per2 dependent micro RNAs. One prominent result of our in silico analysis for cardiac Per2 dependent micro RNAs revealed a selective role for miR-21 in the regulation of hypoxia and metabolic pathways. Based on this Per2 dependency, we subsequently found a diurnal expression pattern for miR-21 with higher miR-21 expression levels at Zeitgeber time (ZT) 15 compared to ZT3. Gain or loss of function studies for miR-21 using miRNA mimics or miRNA inhibitors and a Seahorse Bioanalyzer uncovered a critical role of miR-21 for cellular glycolysis, glycolytic capacity, and glycolytic reserve. Exposing mice to intense light, a strategy to induce Per2, led to a robust induction of cardiac miR-21 tissue levels and decreased infarct sizes, which was abolished in miR-21-/- mice. Similarly, first translational studies in humans using intense blue light exposure for 5 days in healthy volunteers resulted in increased plasma miR-21 levels which was associated with increased phosphofructokinase activity, the rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis. Together, we identified miR-21 as cardioprotective downstream target of Per2 and suggest intense light therapy as a potential strategy to enhance miR-21 activity and subsequent carbohydrate metabolism in humans."

Although pigs are a major reservoir of the virus, the exact sources and transmission route(s) of HEV gt3 to humans remain unclear. Methods To determine the role of meat consumption at a population level, the seroprevalence of anti-HEV IgG antibodies was compared between Dutch blood donors with a vegetarian lifestyle and donors who consume meat on a daily basis. Results The age-weighted anti-HEV IgG seroprevalence among donors not eating meat was significantly lower than among meat-eating donors (12.4% vs 20.5%, p = 0.002). For both groups the prevalence strongly increased with age and the difference in prevalence was apparent for all age groups. Conclusions Compared with meat-eating donors, the incidence of HEV infection is significantly lower among donors not eating meat, indicating that meat consumption is a major risk factor for HEV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2608785274,"Background The Transtheoretical Model (TTM) is a successful framework for guiding behavior change programs for several health behaviors, yet its application to reduce of sedentary behavior has been neglected. In addition, no data exist regarding the association between determinants of sedentary behaviors based on the TTM and physical activity behavior. The purpose of this study was to investigate college students’ stages of motivational readiness to avoid sedentary behaviors and relevant psychological determinants using newly developed TTM questionnaires and to identify the association between current physical activity and sedentary behaviors based on TTM constructs. Methods Data were obtained from 225 college students enrolled in health education and physical education courses. Participants completed a package of questionnaires including validated TTM, physical activity and sitting time questionnaires. Participants also wore an accelerometer for seven consecutive days. MANOVAs were conducted to determine mean differences in psychological constructs across the TTM stages, and Chi-square tests and Spearman correlation were used to evaluate the associations between current physical activity and sedentary behavior. Results A majority of the participants were in the sedentary stages, and men and women differed in proportion of individuals in the stages (78.0% vs. 68.1%, respectively). The gender difference was also found in use of the processes of change. In general, the mean scores of the TTM constructs increased as the stages progressed. No significant associations were found between the TTM constructs for sedentary behavior and current physical activity levels (p>0.05). Conclusions A high proportion of college students were in sedentary stages regardless of physical activity levels, but different distributions in men and women. Participants in earlier stages were less likely to utilize the TTM constructs to reduce sedentary behaviors than those in later stages. A lack of association between physical activity and the psychological determinants of sedentary behavior was found."
https://openalex.org/W2609448601,"Studies on the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have linked the accumulation of lipid metabolites to the development of beta-cell dysfunction and impaired insulin secretion. In most in vitro models of T2DM, rodent islets or beta-cell lines are used and typically focus is on specific cellular pathways or organs. Our aim was to, firstly, develop a combined lipidomics and proteomics approach for lipotoxicity in isolated human islets and, secondly, investigate if the approach could delineate novel and/ or confirm reported mechanisms of lipotoxicity. To this end isolated human pancreatic islets, exposed to chronically elevated palmitate concentrations for 0, 2 and 7 days, were functionally characterized and their levels of multiple targeted lipid and untargeted protein species determined. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from the islets increased on day 2 and decreased on day 7. At day 7 islet insulin content decreased and the proinsulin to insulin content ratio doubled. Amounts of cholesterol, stearic acid, C16 dihydroceramide and C24:1 sphingomyelin, obtained from the lipidomic screen, increased time-dependently in the palmitate-exposed islets. The proteomic screen identified matching changes in proteins involved in lipid biosynthesis indicating up-regulated cholesterol and lipid biosynthesis in the islets. Furthermore, proteins associated with immature secretory granules were decreased when palmitate exposure time was increased despite their high affinity for cholesterol. Proteins associated with mature secretory granules remained unchanged. Pathway analysis based on the protein and lipid expression profiles implicated autocrine effects of insulin in lipotoxicity. Taken together the study demonstrates that combining different omics approaches has potential in mapping of multiple simultaneous cellular events. However, it also shows that challenges exist for effectively combining lipidomics and proteomics in primary cells. Our findings provide insight into how saturated fatty acids contribute to islet cell dysfunction by affecting the granule maturation process and confirmation in human islets of some previous findings from rodent islet and cell-line studies."
https://openalex.org/W2608173396,"It is often helpful to classify biomarker values into groups of different risk levels to facilitate evaluation of a biological, physiological, or pathological state. Stratification of patients into two risk groups is commonly seen, but there is always need for more than two groups for fine assessment. So far, there are no standard methods or tools to help decide how many cutoff points are optimal. In this study, we developed a comprehensive package that included methods to determine both the optimal number and locations of cutoff points for both survival data and dichotomized outcome. We illustrated workflow of this package with data from 797 patients with cervical cancer. By analyzing several risk factors of cervical cancer such as tumor size, body mass index (BMI), number of lymph nodes involved and depth of stromal invasion, in relation to survival and clinical outcome such as lymph nodal metastasis and lymphovascular invasion, we demonstrated that the best choice for BMI and stromal invasion was two cutoff points and one for the others. This study provided a useful tool to facilitate medical decisions and the analyses on cervical cancer may also be of interest to gynecologists. The package can be freely downloaded."
https://openalex.org/W2608260148,"The fuel complex variables canopy bulk density and canopy base height are often used to predict crown fire initiation and spread. Direct measurement of these variables is impractical, and they are usually estimated indirectly by modelling. Recent advances in predicting crown fire behaviour require accurate estimates of the complete vertical distribution of canopy fuels. The objectives of the present study were to model the vertical profile of available canopy fuel in pine stands by using data from the Spanish national forest inventory plus low-density airborne laser scanning (ALS) metrics. In a first step, the vertical distribution of the canopy fuel load was modelled using the Weibull probability density function. In a second step, two different systems of models were fitted to estimate the canopy variables defining the vertical distributions; the first system related these variables to stand variables obtained in a field inventory, and the second system related the canopy variables to airborne laser scanning metrics. The models of each system were fitted simultaneously to compensate the effects of the inherent cross-model correlation between the canopy variables. Heteroscedasticity was also analyzed, but no correction in the fitting process was necessary. The estimated canopy fuel load profiles from field variables explained 84% and 86% of the variation in canopy fuel load for maritime pine and radiata pine respectively; whereas the estimated canopy fuel load profiles from ALS metrics explained 52% and 49% of the variation for the same species. The proposed models can be used to assess the effectiveness of different forest management alternatives for reducing crown fire hazard."
https://openalex.org/W2608868760,"The NAD+-dependent SIRT6 deacetylase was shown to be a major regulator of lifespan and healthspan. Mice deficient for SIRT6 develop a premature aging phenotype and metabolic defects, and die before four weeks of age. Thus, the effect of SIRT6 deficiency in adult mice is unknown. Here we show that SIRT6-/- mice in mixed 129/SvJ/BALB/c background reach adulthood, allowing examination of SIRT6-related metabolic and developmental phenotypes in adult mice. In this mixed background, at 200 days of age, more than 80% of the female knock-out mice were alive whereas only 10% of male knock-out mice survived. In comparison to their wild-type littermates, SIRT6 deficient mice have reduced body weight, increased glucose uptake and exhibit an age-dependent progressive impairment of retinal function accompanied by thinning of retinal layers. Together, these results demonstrate a role for SIRT6 in metabolism and age-related ocular changes in adult mice and suggest a gender specific regulation of lifespan by SIRT6."
https://openalex.org/W2609630511,"Pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) is the most common pediatric brain tumor. A recurrent feature of PA is deregulation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway most often through KIAA1549-BRAF fusion, but also by other BRAF- or RAF1-gene fusions and point mutations (e.g. BRAFV600E). These features may serve as diagnostic and prognostic markers, and also facilitate development of targeted therapy. The aims of this study were to characterize the genetic alterations underlying the development of PA in six tumor cases, and evaluate methods for fusion oncogene detection. Using a combined analysis of RNA sequencing and copy number variation data we identified a new BRAF fusion involving the 5' gene fusion partner GTF2I (7q11.23), not previously described in PA. The new GTF2I-BRAF 19-10 fusion was found in one case, while the other five cases harbored the frequent KIAA1549-BRAF 16-9 fusion gene. Similar to other BRAF fusions, the GTF2I-BRAF fusion retains an intact BRAF kinase domain while the inhibitory N-terminal domain is lost. Functional studies on GTF2I-BRAF showed elevated MAPK pathway activation compared to BRAFWT. Comparing fusion detection methods, we found Fluorescence in situ hybridization with BRAF break apart probe as the most sensitive method for detection of different BRAF rearrangements (GTF2I-BRAF and KIAA1549-BRAF). Our finding of a new BRAF fusion in PA further emphasis the important role of B-Raf in tumorigenesis of these tumor types. Moreover, the consistency and growing list of BRAF/RAF gene fusions suggests these rearrangements to be informative tumor markers in molecular diagnostics, which could guide future treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2608964089,"Cigarette smoking (CS), the main risk factor for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) in developed countries, decreases alveolar macrophages (AM) clearance of both apoptotic cells and bacterial pathogens. This global deficit of AM engulfment may explain why active smokers have worse outcomes of COPD exacerbations, episodes characterized by airway infection and inflammation that carry high morbidity and healthcare cost. When administered as intravenous supplementation, the acute phase-reactant alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) reduces the severity of COPD exacerbations in A1AT deficient (AATD) individuals and of bacterial pneumonia in murine models, but the effect of A1AT on AM scavenging functions has not been reported. Apoptotic cell clearance (efferocytosis) was measured in human AM isolated from patients with COPD, in primary rat AM or differentiated monocytes exposed to CS ex vivo, and in AM recovered from mice exposed to CS. A1AT (100 μg/mL, 16 h) significantly ameliorated efferocytosis (by ~50%) in AM of active smokers or AM exposed ex vivo to CS. A1AT significantly improved AM global engulfment, including phagocytosis, even when cells were simultaneously challenged with apoptotic and Fc-coated (bacteria-like) targets. The improved efferocytosis in A1AT-treated macrophages was associated with inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (TACE) activity, decreased mannose receptor shedding, and markedly increased abundance of efferocytosis receptors (mannose- and phosphatidyl serine receptors and the scavenger receptor B2) on AM plasma membrane. Directed airway A1AT treatment (via inhalation of a nebulized solution) restored in situ airway AM efferocytosis after CS exposure in mice. The amelioration of CS-exposed AM global engulfment may render A1AT as a potential therapy for COPD exacerbations."
https://openalex.org/W2607530362,"Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni is a quarantine pathogen and the causal agent of the bacterial spot disease of stone fruits and almond, a major threat to Prunus species. Rapid and specific detection methods are essential to improve disease management, and therefore a prototype of a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) was designed for the detection of X. arboricola pv. pruni in symptomatic field samples. It was developed by producing polyclonal antibodies which were then combined with carbon nanoparticles and assembled on nitrocellulose strips. The specificity of the LFIA was tested against 87 X. arboricola pv. pruni strains from different countries worldwide, 47 strains of other Xanthomonas species and 14 strains representing other bacterial genera. All X. arboricola pv. pruni strains were detected and cross-reactions were observed only with four strains of X. arboricola pv. corylina, a hazelnut pathogen that does not share habitat with X. arboricola pv. pruni. The sensitivity of the LFIA was assessed with suspensions from pure cultures of three X. arboricola pv. pruni strains and with spiked leaf extracts prepared from four hosts inoculated with this pathogen (almond, apricot, Japanese plum and peach). The limit of detection observed with both pure cultures and spiked samples was 104 CFU ml-1. To demonstrate the accuracy of the test, 205 samples naturally infected with X. arboricola pv. pruni and 113 samples collected from healthy plants of several different Prunus species were analyzed with the LFIA. Results were compared with those obtained by plate isolation and real time PCR and a high correlation was found among techniques. Therefore, we propose this LFIA as a screening tool that allows a rapid and reliable diagnosis of X. arboricola pv. pruni in symptomatic plants."
https://openalex.org/W2608883117,"To develop a vaccine against Toxoplasma gondii, a vaccine antigen with immune-stimulating activity is required. In the present study, we investigated the immunogenicity and prophylactic potential of T. gondii peroxiredoxin 1 (TgPrx1). The TgPrx1 was detected in the ascitic fluid of mice 6 days postinfection, while specific antibody levels were low in the sera of chronically infected mice. Treatment of murine peritoneal macrophages with recombinant TgPrx1 triggered IL-12p40 and IL-6 production, but not IL-10 production. In response to TgPrx1, activation of NF-kB and IL-6 production were confirmed in mouse macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7). These results suggest the immune-stimulating potentials of TgPrx1. Immunization of mice with recombinant TgPrx1 stimulated specific antibody production (IgG1 and IgG2c). Moreover, spleen cell proliferation and interferon-gamma production significantly increased in the TgPrx1- sensitized cells from mice immunized with the same antigen. Immunization with TgPrx1 also increased mouse survival and decreased cerebral parasite burden against lethal T. gondii infection. Thus, our results suggest that TgPrx1 efficiently induces humoral and cellular immune responses and is useful as a new vaccine antigen against toxoplasmosis."
https://openalex.org/W2609161598,"The liver and the kidney are the most common targets of chemical toxicity, due to their major metabolic and excretory functions. However, since the liver is directly involved in biotransformation, compounds in many currently and normally used drugs could affect it adversely. Most chemical compounds are already labeled according to FDA-approved labels using DILI-concern scale. Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) scale refers to an adverse drug reaction. Many compounds do not exhibit hepatotoxicity at early stages of development, so it is important to detect anomalies at gene expression level that could predict adverse reactions in later stages. In this study, a large collection of microarray data is used to investigate gene expression changes associated with hepatotoxicity. Using TG-GATEs a large-scale toxicogenomics database, we present a computational strategy to classify compounds by toxicity levels in human and animal models through patterns of gene expression. We combined machine learning algorithms with time series analysis to identify genes capable of classifying compounds by FDA-approved labeling as DILI-concern toxic. The goal is to define gene expression profiles capable of distinguishing the different subtypes of hepatotoxicity. The study illustrates that expression profiling can be used to classify compounds according to different hepatotoxic levels; to label those that are currently labeled as undertemined; and to determine if at the molecular level, animal models are a good proxy to predict hepatotoxicity in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2607831183,"To ensure faithful transmission of genetic material to progeny cells, DNA replication is tightly regulated, mainly at the initiation step. Escherichia coli cells regulate the frequency of initiation according to growth conditions. Results of the classical, as well as the latest studies, suggest that the DNA replication in E. coli starts at a predefined, constant cell volume per chromosome but the mechanisms coordinating DNA replication with cell growth are still not fully understood. Results of recent investigations have revealed a role of metabolic pathway proteins in the control of cell division and a direct link between metabolism and DNA replication has also been suggested both in Bacillus subtilis and E. coli cells. In this work we show that defects in the acetate overflow pathway suppress the temperature-sensitivity of a defective replication initiator–DnaA under acetogenic growth conditions. Transcriptomic and metabolic analyses imply that this suppression is correlated with pyruvate accumulation, resulting from alterations in the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity. Consequently, deletion of genes encoding the pyruvate dehydrogenase subunits likewise resulted in suppression of the thermal-sensitive growth of the dnaA46 strain. We propose that the suppressor effect may be directly related to the PDH complex activity, providing a link between an enzyme of the central carbon metabolism and DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W2608018100,"Barley net blotch caused by the necrotrophic fungus Pyrenophora teres is a major barley disease in Norway. It can cause grain shriveling and yield losses, and resistance in currently grown cultivars is insufficient. In this study, a set of 589 polymorphic SNP markers was used to map resistance loci in a population of 109 doubled haploid lines from a cross between the closely related Norwegian cultivars Arve (moderately susceptible) and Lavrans (moderately resistant). Resistance to three net form net blotch (P. teres f. teres) single spore isolates was evaluated at the seedling stage in the greenhouse and at the adult plant stage under field conditions during three years. Days to heading and plant height were scored to assess their influence on disease severity. At the seedling stage, three to four quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with resistance were found per isolate used. A major, putatively novel QTL was identified on chromosome 5H, accounting for 23–48% of the genetic variation. Additional QTL explaining between 12 and 16.5% were found on chromosomes 4H, 5H, 6H and 7H, with the one on 6H being race-specific. The major QTL on 5H was also found in adult plants under field conditions in three years (explaining up to 55%) and the 7H QTL was found in field trials in one year. Additional adult plant resistance QTL on 3H, 6H and 7H were significant in single years. The resistance on chromosomes 3H, 5H, 6H and 7H originates from the more resistant parent Lavrans, while the resistance on 4H is conferred by Arve. The genetic markers associated with the QTL found in this study will benefit marker-assisted selection for resistance against net blotch."
https://openalex.org/W2608071686,"Renal and lung fibrosis was characterized by the accumulation of collagen-immunoreactive mesenchymal cells expressing the intermediate filament protein nestin. The present study tested the hypothesis that nestin expression was increased in the hypertrophied/fibrotic left ventricle of suprarenal abdominal aorta constricted adult male Sprague-Dawley rats and induced in ventricular fibroblasts by pro-fibrotic peptide growth factors. Nestin protein levels were upregulated in the pressure-overloaded left ventricle and expression positively correlated with the rise of mean arterial pressure. In sham and pressure-overloaded hearts, nestin immunoreactivity was detected in collagen type I(+)-and CD31(+)-cells identified in the interstitium and perivascular region whereas staining was absent in smooth muscle α-actin(+)-cells. A significantly greater number of collagen type I(+)-cells co-expressing nestin was identified in the left ventricle of pressure-overloaded rats. Moreover, an accumulation of nestin(+)-cells lacking collagen, CD31 and smooth muscle α-actin staining was selectively observed at the adventitial region of predominantly large calibre blood vessels in the hypertrophied/fibrotic left ventricle. Angiotensin II and TGF-β1 stimulation of ventricular fibroblasts increased nestin protein levels via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase- and protein kinase C/SMAD3-dependent pathways, respectively. CD31/eNOS(+)-rat cardiac microvascular endothelial cells synthesized/secreted collagen type I, expressed prolyl 4-hydroxylase and TGF-β1 induced nestin expression. The selective accumulation of adventitial nestin(+)-cells highlighted a novel feature of large vessel remodelling in the pressure-overloaded heart and increased appearance of collagen type I/nestin(+)-cells may reflect an activated phenotype of ventricular fibroblasts. CD31/collagen/nestin(+)-interstitial cells could represent displaced endothelial cells displaying an unmasked mesenchymal phenotype, albeit contribution to the reactive fibrotic response of the pressure-overloaded heart remains unknown."
https://openalex.org/W2610083523,"Introduction Hot flashes have been postulated to be linked to the development of metabolic disorders. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between hot flashes, adipocyte-derived hormones, and insulin resistance in healthy, non-obese postmenopausal women. Participants and design In this cross-sectional study, a total of 151 women aged 45–60 years were stratified into one of three groups according to hot-flash status over the past three months: never experienced hot flashes (Group N), mild-to-moderate hot flashes (Group M), and severe hot flashes (Group S). Variables measured in this study included clinical parameters, hot flash experience, fasting levels of circulating glucose, lipid profiles, plasma insulin, and adipocyte-derived hormones. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the associations of hot flashes with adipocyte-derived hormones, and with insulin resistance. Settings The study was performed in a hospital medical center. Results The mean (standard deviation) of body-mass index was 22.8(2.7) for Group N, 22.6(2.6) for Group M, and 23.5(2.4) for Group S, respectively. Women in Group S displayed statistically significantly higher levels of leptin, fasting glucose, and insulin, and lower levels of adiponectin than those in Groups M and N. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that hot-flash severity was significantly associated with higher leptin levels, lower adiponectin levels, and higher leptin-to-adiponectin ratio. Univariate linear regression analysis revealed that hot-flash severity was strongly associated with a higher HOMA-IR index (% difference, 58.03%; 95% confidence interval, 31.00–90.64; p < 0.001). The association between hot flashes and HOMA-IR index was attenuated after adjusting for leptin or adiponectin and was no longer significant after simultaneously adjusting for leptin and adiponectin. Conclusion The present study provides evidence that hot flashes are associated with insulin resistance in postmenopausal women. It further suggests that hot flash association with insulin resistance is dependent on the combination of leptin and adiponectin variables."
https://openalex.org/W2608219125,"We investigate the dynamics of individual pro-social behavior over time. The dynamics are tested by running the same experiment with the same subjects at several points in time. To exclude learning and reputation building, we employ non-strategic decision tasks and a sequential prisoners-dilemma as a control treatment. In the first wave, pro-social concerns explain a high share of individual decisions. Pro-social decisions decrease over time, however. In the final wave, most decisions can be accounted for by assuming pure selfishness. Stable behavior in the sense that subjects stick to their decisions over time is observed predominantly for purely selfish subjects. We offer two explanation for our results: diminishing experimenter demand effects and moral self-licensing."
https://openalex.org/W2609549211,"Teleosts exhibit a broad divergence in their adaptive response to stress, depending on the magnitude, duration, and frequency of stressors and the species receiving the stimulus. We have previously reported that the red cusk-eel (Genypterus chilensis), an important marine farmed fish, shows a physiological response to stress that results in increased skeletal muscle atrophy mediated by over-expression of components of the ubiquitin proteasome and autophagy-lysosomal systems. To better understand the systemic effects of stress on the red cusk-eel metabolism, the present study assessed the transcriptomic hepatic response to repetitive handling-stress. Using high-throughput RNA-seq, 259 up-regulated transcripts were found, mostly associated with angiogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and triacylglyceride catabolism. Conversely, 293 transcripts were down-regulated, associated to cholesterol biosynthesis, PPARα signaling, fatty acid biosynthesis, and glycolysis. This gene signature was concordant with hepatic metabolite levels and hepatic oxidative damage. Moreover, the increased plasmatic levels of AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase) and AP (alkaline phosphatase), as well as liver histology suggest stress-induced liver steatosis. This study offers an integrative molecular and biochemical analysis of the hepatic response to handling-stress, and reveals unknown aspects of lipid metabolism in a non-model teleost."
https://openalex.org/W2609632774,"Cocaine induces vasoconstriction in cerebral vessels, which with repeated use can result in transient ischemic attacks and cerebral strokes. However, the neuroadaptations that follow cocaine’s vasoconstricting effects are not well understood. Here, we investigated the effects of chronic cocaine exposure (2 and 4 weeks) on markers of vascular function and morphology in the rat brain. For this purpose we measured nitric oxide (NO) concentration in plasma, brain neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS or NOS1), HIF-1α, and VEGF expression in different brain regions, i.e., middle prefrontal cortex, somatosensory cortex, nucleus accumbens, and dorsal striatum, using ELISA or Western blot. Additionally, microvascular density in these brain regions was measured using immunofluorescence microscopy. We showed that chronic cocaine significantly affected NOS1, HIF-1α and VEGF expression, in a region- and cocaine treatment-time- dependent manner. Cerebral microvascular density increased significantly in parallel to these neurochemical changes. Furthermore, significant correlations were detected between VEGF expression and microvascular density in cortical regions (middle prefrontal cortex and somatosensory cortex), but not in striatal regions (nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum). These results suggest that following chronic cocaine use, as cerebral ischemia developed, NOS1, the regulatory protein to counteract blood vessel constriction, was upregulated; meanwhile, the HIF-VEGF pathway was activated to increase microvascular density (i.e., angiogenesis) and thus restore local blood flow and oxygen supply. These physiological responses were triggered presumably as an adaptation to minimize ischemic injury caused by cocaine. Therefore, effectively promoting such physiological responses may provide novel and effective therapeutic solutions to treat cocaine-induced cerebral ischemia and stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2608640147,"microRNAs (miRNAs) are derived from self-complementary hairpin structures, while small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are derived from double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or hairpin precursors. The core mechanism of sRNA production involves DICER-like (DCL) in processing the smallRNAs (sRNAs) and ARGONAUTE (AGO) as effectors of silencing, and siRNA biogenesis also involves action of RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase (RDR), Pol IV and Pol V in biogenesis. Several other proteins interact with the core proteins to guide sRNA biogenesis, action, and turnover. We aimed to unravel the components and functions of the RNA-guided silencing pathway in a non-model plant species of worldwide economic relevance. The sRNA-guided silencing complex members have been identified in the Coffea canephora genome, and they have been characterized at the structural, functional, and evolutionary levels by computational analyses. Eleven AGO proteins, nine DCL proteins (which include a DCL1-like protein that was not previously annotated), and eight RDR proteins were identified. Another 48 proteins implicated in smallRNA (sRNA) pathways were also identified. Furthermore, we identified 235 miRNA precursors and 317 mature miRNAs from 113 MIR families, and we characterized ccp-MIR156, ccp-MIR172, and ccp-MIR390. Target prediction and gene ontology analyses of 2239 putative targets showed that significant pathways in coffee are targeted by miRNAs. We provide evidence of the expansion of the loci related to sRNA pathways, insights into the activities of these proteins by domain and catalytic site analyses, and gene expression analysis. The number of MIR loci and their targeted pathways highlight the importance of miRNAs in coffee. We identified several roles of sRNAs in C. canephora, which offers substantial insight into better understanding the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of this major crop."
https://openalex.org/W2607894016,"Bmps regulate numerous neural functions with their regulators. We previously identified Brorin, a neural-specific secreted antagonist of Bmp signaling, in humans, mice, and zebrafish. Mouse Brorin has two cysteine-rich domains containing 10 cysteine residues in its core region, and these are located in similar positions to those in the cysteine-rich domains of Chordin family members, which are secreted Bmp antagonists. Zebrafish Brorin had two cysteine-rich domains with high similarity to those of mouse Brorin. We herein examined zebrafish brorin in order to elucidate its in vivo actions. Zebrafish brorin was predominantly expressed in developing neural tissues. The overexpression of brorin led to the inactivation of Bmp signaling. On the other hand, the knockdown of brorin resulted in the activation of Bmp signaling and brorin morphants exhibited defective development of the ventral domain in the forebrain. Furthermore, the knockdown of brorin inhibited the generation of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons and oligodendrocytes and promoted the generation of astrocytes in the forebrain. In addition, brorin was required for axon guidance in the forebrain. The present results suggest that Brorin is a secreted Bmp antagonist predominantly expressed in developing neural tissues and that it plays multiple roles in the development of the zebrafish forebrain."
https://openalex.org/W2608375730,"Vitamin D deficiency is a growing health problem in both the general population and in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and health-related quality of life in CKD is not well established. This study examined the association between vitamin D deficiency and quality of life in pre-dialysis CKD patients. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and the Korean version of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life short form were obtained for 1844 pre-dialysis CKD patients in the prospective KoreaN cohort Study for Outcomes in patients With Chronic Kidney Disease (KNOW-CKD). The baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate was 50.26 ± 0.71 mL/min/1.73 m2. We identified 1294 (70.2%) patients with vitamin D deficiency, defined as a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level < 20 ng/ml. The scores of the kidney disease component summary, physical component summary, and mental component summary in the vitamin D deficiency group were significantly lower compared to the scores of those without vitamin D deficiency. The serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was independently associated with the kidney disease component summary and mental component summary scores (β = 0.147, p = 0.003 and β = 0.151, p = 0.047). In conclusion, there was a significant association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and kidney disease component summary and mental component summary scores in pre-dialysis CKD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2608526218,"Soil loss through wind and water erosion is an ongoing problem in semiarid regions. A thin layer of top soil loss over a hectare of cropland could be corresponding to tons of productive soil loss per hectare. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the influence of beef feedlot manure, tillage and legume grass mixtures on changes in soil quality and nutrient components. The study was initiated in 2006 on an eroded site near Akron, Colorado, on a Norka-Colby very-fine sandy loam (fine-silty, mixed, mesic, Aridic, Argiustolls). Tillage treatments were no-tillage, shallow tillage (sweeps operations with V-blade) and deep tillage (DT; moldboard plow operations). In one set of plots, DT was implemented biannually (DT-2); and in another set the DT was done once at the initiation of the experiment in 2006. Amendments consisted of beef manure and urea (46-0-0), N fertilizer. Both amendments were added at low and high rates. A control treatment, with no fertilizer or manure added, was included with no-tillage and shallow tillage only. Six years of manure addition and tillage significantly altered soil chemical properties compared with fertilizer and grass legume mixtures. Across all the tillage treatments, at the 0–30 cm depth, soil pH from 2006 to 2012, was reduced 1.8 fold with high-manure compared with high-fertilizer treatment. Soil EC, Na, and SAR increased by 2.7 fold while soil P increase by 3.5 fold with high-manure treatment compared with low-manure from 2006 to 2012 across all the tillage treatments at the surface 0–30 cm. Soil organic carbon associated with high-manure was 71% higher than low-manure and 230% higher than high-fertilizer treatments in the 0–60 cm depth. Similar patterns were observed with soil total N. Overall, manure amendments greatly improved the soil nutrient status on this eroded site. However, the legume grass mixtures showed little effect on improving soils chemical properties. The micronutrients supplied by manure improved the soil nutrient status compared with inorganic fertilizer, the grass, and the grass-legume treatments. We concluded that more than six years are needed to measure significant improvements in soil quality from specific treatments, specifically fertilizer, grasses, and grass-legume mixtures in such eroded crop land."

The scaling method was applied in this study using specific SRM peak areas (AUCs) derived from the endogenous reference protein that normalizes all SRM AUCs obtained for the candidate proteins. In a screening verification study, we found that seven out of the 46 candidate proteins were statistically significant for the LCNEC phenotype, including 4F2hc cell surface antigen heavy chain (4F2hc/CD98) (p-ANOVA ≤ 0.0012), retinal dehydrogenase 1 (p-ANOVA ≤ 0.0029), apolipoprotein A-I (p-ANOVA ≤ 0.0004), β-enolase (p-ANOVA ≤ 0.0043), creatine kinase B-type (p-ANOVA ≤ 0.0070), and galectin-3-binding protein (p-ANOVA = 0.0080), and phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (p-ANOVA ≤ 0.0012). In addition, we also identified candidate proteins specific to the small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) subtype. These candidates include brain acid soluble protein 1 (p-ANOVA < 0.0001) and γ-enolase (p-ANOVA ≤ 0.0013). This new relative quantitation-based approach utilizing the scaling method can be applied to assess hundreds of protein candidates obtained from discovery proteomic studies as a first step of the verification phase in biomarker development processes."
https://openalex.org/W2609779102,"Mutations in the renal sodium-dependent phosphate co-transporters NPT2a and NPT2c have been reported in patients with renal stone disease and nephrocalcinosis, but the relative contribution of genotype, dietary calcium and phosphate to the formation of renal mineral deposits is unclear. We previously reported that renal calcium phosphate deposits persist and/or reappear in older Npt2a-/- mice supplemented with phosphate despite resolution of hypercalciuria while no deposits are seen in wild-type (WT) mice on the same diet. Addition of calcium to their diets further increased calcium phosphate deposits in Npt2a-/-, but not WT mice. The response of PTH to dietary phosphate of Npt2a-/- was blunted when compared to WT mice and the response of the urinary calcium x phosphorus product to the addition of calcium and phosphate to the diet of Npt2a-/- was increased. These finding suggests that Npt2a-/- mice respond differently to dietary phosphate when compared to WT mice. Further evaluation in the Npt2a-/- cohort on different diets suggests that urinary calcium excretion, plasma phosphate and FGF23 levels appear to be positively correlated to renal mineral deposit formation while urine phosphate levels and the urine anion gap, an indirect measure of ammonia excretion, appear to be inversely correlated. Our observations in Npt2a-/- mice, if confirmed in humans, may be relevant for the optimization of existing and the development of novel therapies to prevent nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis in human carriers of NPT2a and NPT2c mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2610015554,"Background Use of narcotic or “recreational” drugs has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm delivery. However, the associations might be confounded by other factors related to high-risk behaviours. This is the first study to investigate the association between traditional opium use during pregnancy and risk of preterm delivery. Method and findings We performed a population-based cohort study in the rural areas of the Golestan province, Iran between 2008 and 2010. We randomly selected 920 women who used (usually smoked) opium during pregnancy and 920 women who did not. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations between the opium use during pregnancy and preterm delivery and adjustment was made for potential confounding factors. This study shows compared with non-use of opium and tobacco, use of only opium during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery (OR = 1.56; 95% CI 1.05–2.32), and the risk was more than two-fold increased among dual users of opium and tobacco (OR = 2.31; 95% CI 1.37–3.90). We observed that opium use only was associated with a doubled risk for preterm caesarean delivery (OR = 2.05; 95% CI 1.10–3.82) but not for preterm vaginal delivery (OR = 1.25; 95% CI 0.75–2.07). Dual use of opium and tobacco was associated with a substantially increased risk of vaginal preterm delivery (OR = 2.58; 95% CI 1.41–4.71). Conclusions Opium use during pregnancy among non-tobacco smokers is associated with an increased risk of preterm caesarean delivery, indicating an increased risk of a compromised foetus before or during labour. Women who use both opium and smoked during pregnancy have an increased risk of preterm vaginal delivery, indicating an increased risk of spontaneous preterm delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2607632188,"Molecular targeting therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has clarified the importance of mutation testing when selecting treatment regimens. As a result, multiple-gene mutation tests are urgently needed. We developed a next-generation sequencer (NGS)-based, multi-gene test named the MINtS for investigating driver mutations in both cytological specimens and snap-frozen tissue samples. The MINtS was used to investigate the EGFR, KRAS, BRAF genes from DNA, and the ERBB2, and the ALK, ROS1, and RET fusion genes from RNA. We focused on high specificity and sensitivity (≥0.99) and even included samples with a cancer cell content of 1%. The MINtS enables testing of more than 100 samples in a single run, making it possible to process a large number of samples submitted to a central laboratory, and reducing the cost for a single sample. We investigated 96 cytological samples and 190 surgically resected tissues, both of which are isolated in daily clinical practice. With the cytological samples, we compared the results for the EGFR mutation between the MINtS and the PNA-LNA PCR clamp test, and their results were 99% consistent. In the snap-frozen tissue samples, 188/190 (99%) samples were successfully analyzed for all genes investigated using both DNA and RNA. Then, we used 200 cytological samples that were serially isolated in clinical practice to assess RNA quality. Using our procedure, 196 samples (98%) provided high-quality RNA suitable for analysis with the MINtS. We concluded that the MINtS test system is feasible for analyzing ""druggable"" genes using cytological samples and snap-frozen tissue samples. The MINtS will fill a needs for patients for whom only cytological specimens are available for genetic testing."
https://openalex.org/W2608019241,"Triglycerides (TAGs), the major storage molecules of metabolic energy and source of fatty acids, are produced as single cell oil by some oleogenic microorganisms. However, these microorganisms require strict culture conditions, show low carbon source flexibilities, lack efficient genetic modification tools and in some cases pose safety concerns. TAGs have essential applications such as behaving as a source for added-value fatty acids or giving rise to the production of biodiesel. Hence, new alternative methods are urgently required for obtaining these oils. In this work we describe TAG accumulation in the industrially appropriate microorganism Escherichia coli expressing the heterologous enzyme tDGAT, a wax ester synthase/triacylglycerol:acylCoA acyltranferase (WS/DGAT). With this purpose, we introduce a codon-optimized gene from the thermophilic actinomycete Thermomonospora curvata coding for a WS/DGAT into different E. coli strains, describe the metabolic effects associated to the expression of this protein and evaluate neutral lipid accumulation. We observe a direct relation between the expression of this WS/DGAT and TAG production within a wide range of culture conditions. More than 30% TAGs were detected within the bacterial neutral lipids in 90 minutes after induction. TAGs were observed to be associated with the hydrophobic enzyme while forming round intracytoplasmic bodies, which could represent a bottleneck for lipid accumulation in E. coli. We detected an increase of almost 3-fold in the monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) occurring in the recombinant strains. These MUFA were predominant in the accumulated TAGs achieving 46% of the TAG fatty acids. These results set the basis for further research on the achievement of a suitable method towards the sustainable production of these neutral lipids."

Optimization of growth monitoring requires standardization of the definition of abnormal growth, and the selection of the priority target conditions is a prerequisite of such standardization.To obtain a consensus about the priority target conditions for algorithms monitoring children's growth.We applied a formal consensus method with a modified version of the RAND/UCLA method, based on three phases (preparatory, literature review, and rating), with the participation of expert advisory groups from the relevant professional medical societies (ranging from primary care providers to hospital subspecialists) as well as parent associations. We asked experts in the pilot (n = 11), reading (n = 8) and rating (n = 60) groups to complete the list of diagnostic classification of the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and then to select the conditions meeting the four predefined criteria of an ideal type of priority target condition.Strong agreement was obtained for the 8 conditions selected by the experts among the 133 possible: celiac disease, Crohn disease, craniopharyngioma, juvenile nephronophthisis, Turner syndrome, growth hormone deficiency with pituitary stalk interruption syndrome, infantile cystinosis, and hypothalamic-optochiasmatic astrocytoma (in decreasing order of agreement).This national consensus can be used to evaluate the algorithms currently suggested for growth monitoring.

https://openalex.org/W2608747900,"This paper develops a means of more easily and less invasively estimating ventricular dead space volume (Vd), an important, but difficult to measure physiological parameter. Vd represents a subject and condition dependent portion of measured ventricular volume that is not actively participating in ventricular function. It is employed in models based on the time varying elastance concept, which see widespread use in haemodynamic studies, and may have direct diagnostic use. The proposed method involves linear extrapolation of a Frank-Starling curve (stroke volume vs end-diastolic volume) and its end-systolic equivalent (stroke volume vs end-systolic volume), developed across normal clinical procedures such as recruitment manoeuvres, to their point of intersection with the y-axis (where stroke volume is 0) to determine Vd. To demonstrate the broad applicability of the method, it was validated across a cohort of six sedated and anaesthetised male Pietrain pigs, encompassing a variety of cardiac states from healthy baseline behaviour to circulatory failure due to septic shock induced by endotoxin infusion. Linear extrapolation of the curves was supported by strong linear correlation coefficients of R = 0.78 and R = 0.80 average for pre- and post- endotoxin infusion respectively, as well as good agreement between the two linearly extrapolated y-intercepts (Vd) for each subject (no more than 7.8% variation). Method validity was further supported by the physiologically reasonable Vd values produced, equivalent to 44.3-53.1% and 49.3-82.6% of baseline end-systolic volume before and after endotoxin infusion respectively. This method has the potential to allow Vd to be estimated without a particularly demanding, specialised protocol in an experimental environment. Further, due to the common use of both mechanical ventilation and recruitment manoeuvres in intensive care, this method, subject to the availability of multi-beat echocardiography, has the potential to allow for estimation of Vd in a clinical environment."

T cells are the major facilitators of protection and effector functions with CD4+ T cells being the most important players, followed by CD8+ T cells. The common γ-chain cytokines IL-2, IL-7, IL-15, and IL-21 play a vital role in peripheral T cell growth and survival. However, the role of common γ-chain cytokines in pulmonary TB (PTB) is poorly understood.To examine the association of circulating common γ-chain cytokines with TB disease or infection, we examined the systemic levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-15, and IL-21 in individuals with PTB, latent TB (LTB) or no TB infection (NTB). We also examined the levels of these cytokines in PTB individuals before and after anti-tuberculosis treatment.Circulating levels of IL-2, IL-7 and IL-21 were significantly diminished in PTB compared to LTB or NTB individuals. Moreover, TB antigen stimulated whole blood also exhibited diminished levels of common γ-chain cytokines in PTB compared to LTB or NTB individuals. The plasma levels of common γ-chain cytokines exhibited no significant association with the severity or extent of TB disease or with bacterial burdens. However, upon standard anti-TB treatment, both the systemic as well as the TB antigen stimulated levels of IL-2, IL-7 and IL-21 were significantly increased in PTB individuals.Therefore our data demonstrate that diminished levels of common γ-chain cytokines are a common characteristic of PTB and potentially highlight the importance of boosting these responses to improve treatment outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2609205366,"Objective This study aimed to investigate the pattern of general practice services utilization for Australian children and to examine socio-demographic disparities in general practitioner (GP) visits. Methods We used the linked data from the nationally representative Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) and the Medicare Australia claims data record. We used survey negative binomial and logistic regression to examine the socio-demographic factors associated with the utilisation of general practice services. Results The average number of annual GP visits gradually declined from 7.0 at 0–1 year old to 2.4 at 5–8 years (p< .001 for trend) in the infant cohort and from 3.5 at 2–4 years to 2.0 at 9–12 years (p < .001 for trend) in the child cohort. Girls were more likely to visit GPs than boys at 0–1 year old in the infant cohort (RR = 1.06, 95%CI: 1.02–1.11) and at 2–4 years in the child cohort (RR = 1.09, 95%CI: 1.04–1.14), but there were no differences at 2–4 to 5–8 year age periods in the infant cohort and at 5–8 to 9–12 year age period in the child cohort. Children from non-English speaking background were more likely to have a greater number of GP visits compared with their counterparts from English-speaking and Indigenous background up to eight year old in both cohorts (all p < .001). Children from families with the higher socio-economic position, children without private health insurance and children living in non-metropolitan were less likely to have GP consultations in both cohorts. Fair or poor parent-rated health status was associated with greater number of GP visits. Conclusion Socio-demographic disparities existed in the utilisation of general practice services and varied at different age periods. Family socio-economic position, private health insurance coverage and region of residence strongly associates with the utilisation disparities over all age period. Further policy interventions are called to minimise the disparities in GP utilisation for children in Australian context."
https://openalex.org/W2609388058,"Metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes are diseases which develop gradually over time through the perturbations of biological processes. These perturbed biological processes usually work in an interdependent way. Systematic experiments tracking disease progression at gene level are usually conducted through a temporal microarray data. There is a need for developing methods to analyze such highly complex data to capture disease progression at the molecular level. In the present study, we have considered temporal microarray data from an experiment conducted to study development of obesity and diabetes in mice. We first constructed a network between biological processes through common genes. We analyzed the data to obtain perturbed biological processes at each time point. Finally, we used the biological process network to find links between these perturbed biological processes. This enabled us to identify paths linking initial perturbed processes with final perturbed processes which capture disease progression. Using different datasets and statistical tests, we established that these paths are highly precise to the dataset from which these are obtained. We also established that the connecting genes present in these paths might contain some biological information and thus can be used for further mechanistic studies. The methods developed in our study are also applicable to a broad array of temporal data."
https://openalex.org/W2607707817,"Black gram (Vigna mungo) seeds are a rich source of digestible proteins, however, during storage these seeds are severely damaged by bruchids (Callosobruchus spp.), reducing seed quality and yield losses. Most of the cultivated genotypes of black gram are susceptible to bruchids, however, few tolerant genotypes have also been identified but the mechanism of tolerance is poorly understood. We employed Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) to identify specifically, but rarely expressed bruchid egg induced genes in black gram. In this study, Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) library was constructed to study the genes involved in defense response in black gram against bruchid infestation. An EST library of 277 clones was obtained for further analyses. Based on CAP3 assembly, 134 unigenes were computationally annotated using Blast2GOPRO software. In all, 20 defense related genes were subject to quantitative PCR analysis (qPCR) out of which 12 genes showed up-regulation in developing seeds of the pods oviposited by bruchids. Few major defense genes like defensin, pathogenesis related protein (PR), lipoxygenase (LOX) showed high expression levels in the oviposited population when compared with the non-oviposited plants. This is the first report on defense related gene transcript dynamics during the bruchid-black gram interaction using SSH library. This library would be useful to clone defense related gene(s) such as defensin as represented in our library for crop improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2608141696,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 (SCA-3) is the most prevalent autosomal dominant inherited ataxia. We recently found that the endocannabinoid system is altered in the post-mortem cerebellum of SCA-3 patients, and similar results were also found in the cerebellar and brainstem nuclei of a SCA-3 transgenic mouse model. Given that the neuropathology of SCA-3 is not restricted to these two brain regions but rather, it is also evident in other structures (e.g., the basal ganglia), we studied the possible changes to endocannabinoid signaling in the striatum of these transgenic mice. SCA-3 mutant mice suffer defects in motor coordination, balance and they have an abnormal gait, reflecting a cerebellar/brainstem neuropathology. However, they also show dystonia-like behavior (limb clasping) that may be related to the malfunction/deterioration of specific neurons in the striatum. Indeed, we found a loss of striatal projecting neurons in SCA-3 mutant mice, accompanied by a reduction in glial glutamate transporters that could potentially aggravate excitotoxic damage. In terms of endocannabinoid signaling, no changes in CB2 receptors were evident, yet an important reduction in CB1 receptors was detected by qPCR and immunostaining. The reduction in CB1 receptors was presumed to occur in striatal afferent and efferent neurons, also potentially aggravating excitotoxicity. We also measured the endocannabinoid lipids in the striatum and despite a marked increase in the FAAH enzyme in this area, no overall changes in these lipids were found. Collectively, these studies confirm that the striatal endocannabinoid system is altered in SCA-3 mutant mice, adding to the equivalent changes found in other strongly affected CNS structures in this type of ataxia (i.e.: the cerebellum and brainstem). These data open the way to search for drugs that might correct these changes."

We used fruit extracts from previously generated human type I InsP 5-ptase gene expressing transgenic tomato plants for assessment of the anti-cancer activity of established genetically modified tomato lines. Cellular assays (MTT, Fluorescent microscopy, Flow Cytometry analysis) were used to confirm that InsP 5-ptase fruit extract was more effective for reducing the proliferation of breast cancer cells compared to wild-type tomato fruit extract. Metabolome analysis of InsP 5-ptase expressing tomato fruits performed by LC-MS identified tomato metabolites that may play a key role in the increased anti-cancer activity observed for the transgenic fruits. Total transcriptome analysis of cancer cells (MCF-7 line) exposed to an extract of transgenic fruits revealed a number of differently regulated genes in the cells treated with transgenic extract compared to untreated cells or cells treated with wild-type tomato extract. Together, this data demonstrate the potential role of the plant derived metabolites in suppressing cell viability of cancer cells and further prove the potential application of plant genetic engineering in the cancer research and drug discovery."

As seen previously, mice injected with CCl4 exhibited increased plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine; transient body weight loss; and increased lipid peroxidation along with decreased total antioxidant power, glutathione, ATP, and NADPH. Pre-treatment of these animals with V.D3 caused further elevation of the values of these liver functional markers without altering kidney functional markers; continued weight loss; a lower lethal threshold dose of CCl4; and enhanced effects on lipid peroxidation and total antioxidant power. In contrast, exposure to V.D3 alone had no effect on plasma markers of liver or kidney damage or on total antioxidant power or lipid peroxidation. The potentiating effect of V.D3 was positively correlated with elevation of hepatic calcium levels. Furthermore, direct injection of CaCl2 also enhanced CCl4-induced hepatic injury. Since CaCl2 induced hypercalcemia transiently (within 3 h of injection), our results suggest that calcium enhances the CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity at an early stage via potentiation of oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2609685602,"In this article we demonstrate that negation of ideas can have paradoxical effects, possibly leading the listener to believe that the negated ideas actually existed. In Experiment 1, participants listened to a description of a house, in which some objects were mentioned, some were negated, and some were not mentioned at all. When questioned about the existence of these objects a week later, the participants gave more false positives for items that were negated in the original material than for items that were not mentioned at all, an effect we call negation related false memories (NRFM). The NRFM effect was replicated again in Experiment 2 with a sample of five and six year-old children. Experiment 3 confirmed NRFM in the case of negated actions. The results are discussed in terms of retention hypothesis, as well as the theory that negation can activate a representation of an entity and behaviour. It is also indicated that future research is needed to ensure that it is indeed negation which caused false alarms, not merely mentioning an object."
https://openalex.org/W2609766424,"The Herpevac Trial for Women revealed that three dose HSV-2 gD vaccine was 58% protective against culture-positive HSV-1 genital disease, but it was not protective against HSV-2 infection or disease. To determine whether vaccine-induced immune responses had selected for a particular gD sequence in strains infecting vaccine recipients compared with viruses infecting control subjects, genetic sequencing studies were carried out on viruses isolated from subjects infected with HSV-1 or HSV-2. We identified naturally occurring variants among the gD sequences obtained from 83 infected subjects. Unique or low frequency amino acid substitutions in the ectodomain of gD were found in 6 of 39 HSV-1-infected subjects and in 7 of 44 HSV-2-infected subjects. However, no consistent amino acid change was identified in isolates from gD-2 vaccine recipients compared with infected placebo recipients. gC and gE surround and partially shield gD from neutralizing antibody, and gB also participates closely in the viral entry process. Therefore, these genes were sequenced from a number of isolates to assess whether sequence variation may alter protein conformation and influence the virus strain's capacity to be neutralized by vaccine-induced antibody. gC and gE genes sequenced from HSV-1-infected subjects showed more variability than their HSV-2 counterparts. The gB sequences of HSV-1 oral isolates resembled each other more than they did gB sequences rom genital isolates. Overall, however, comparison of glycoprotein sequences of viral isolates obtained from infected subjects did not reveal any singular selective pressure on the viral cell attachment protein or surrounding glycoproteins due to administration of gD-2 vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2609079052,"Controlled pollination (CP) is an important tool for breeding programs to improve seed quality, as it rapidly generates desirable genotypes and maximizes genetic gains. However, few studies have evaluated the success rate of CP, especially in Larix gmelinii var. principis-rupprechtii Mayr. seed orchards. In this study, we estimated the rate of correct parentage in 257 CP progeny in an L. gmelinii var. principis-rupprechtii seed orchard from ten candidate parents using 13 microsatellites. The parentage exclusion probabilities of all combined loci in the single parent and parent pair tests were > 0.99, which was sufficient to distinguish the relatedness of the sampled individuals. Comparing the maximum likelihood-based parentage analysis results with breeding records revealed that the percentages of correctly identified maternal and paternal parents were 22.6% and 35.0% at 95% CL, respectively, suggestive of parent mislabeling and pollen contamination in the CP population. We conducted a pedigree reconstruction by identifying the expected parents and assigned maternity, paternity, and parent pairs to 176 (68.5%), 199 (77.4%), and 132 (51.4%) progeny, respectively. This study provides a reference for future selection of elite genotypes for commercial production. To increase the efficiency of CP, molecular markers should be used to correctly identify individuals in seed orchards before conducting CP."
