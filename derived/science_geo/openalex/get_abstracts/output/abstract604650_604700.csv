https://openalex.org/W2728438250,"The inter-areal wiring pattern of the mouse cerebral cortex was analyzed in relation to a refined parcellation of cortical areas. Twenty-seven retrograde tracer injections were made in 19 areas of a 47-area parcellation of the mouse neocortex. Flat mounts of the cortex and multiple histological markers enabled detailed counts of labeled neurons in individual areas. The observed log-normal distribution of connection weights to each cortical area spans 5 orders of magnitude and reveals a distinct connectivity profile for each area, analogous to that observed in macaques. The cortical network has a density of 97%, considerably higher than the 66% density reported in macaques. A weighted graph analysis reveals a similar global efficiency but weaker spatial clustering compared with that reported in macaques. The consistency, precision of the connectivity profile, density, and weighted graph analysis of the present data differ significantly from those obtained in earlier studies in the mouse."

The effect of brain state on circuit output requires understanding of how neuromodulators influence specific neuronal classes and their synapses, with normal patterns of neuromodulator release from endogenous sources. We investigated the state-dependent modulation of a ubiquitous feedforward inhibitory motif in mouse sensory cortex, local pyramidal (Pyr) inputs onto somatostatin (SST)-expressing interneurons. Paired whole-cell recordings in acute brain slices and in vivo showed that Pyr-to-SST synapses are remarkably weak, with failure rates approaching 80%. Pharmacological screening revealed that cholinergic agonists uniquely enhance synaptic efficacy. Brief, optogenetically gated acetylcholine release dramatically enhanced Pyr-to-SST input, via nicotinic receptors and presynaptic PKA signaling. Importantly, endogenous acetylcholine release preferentially activated nicotinic, not muscarinic, receptors, thus differentiating drug effects from endogenous neurotransmission. Brain state- and synapse-specific unmasking of synapses may be a powerful way to functionally rewire cortical circuits dependent on behavioral demands."
https://openalex.org/W2785388585,"Mortality of fish has been reported in tide pools during warm days. That means that tide pools are potential ecological traps for coastal organisms, which happen when environmental changes cause maladaptive habitat selection. Heat-waves are predicted to increase in intensity, duration and frequency, making it relevant to investigate the role of tide pools as traps for coastal organisms. However, heat waves can also lead to acclimatization. If organisms undergo acclimatization prior to being trapped in tide pools, their survival chances may increase. Common tide pool species (46 species in total) were collected at a tropical and a temperate area and their upper thermal limits estimated. They were maintained for 10 days at their mean summer sea surface temperature +3°C, mimicking a heat-wave. Their upper thermal limits were estimated again, after this acclimation period, to calculate each species’ acclimation response. The upper thermal limits of the organisms were compared to the temperatures attained by tide pool waters to investigate if 1) tide pools could be considered ecological traps and 2) if the increase in upper thermal limits elicited by the acclimation period could make the organisms less vulnerable to this threat. Tropical tide pools were found to be ecological traps for an important number of common coastal species, given that they can attain temperatures higher than the upper thermal limits of most of those species. Tide pools are not ecological traps in temperate zones. Tropical species have higher thermal limits than temperate species, but lower acclimation response, that does not allow them to survive the maximum habitat temperature of tropical tide pools. This way, tropical coastal organisms seem to be, not only more vulnerable to climate warming per se, but also to an increase in the ecological trap effect of tide pools."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of contextual and individual factors with the utilisation of dental services by Brazilian adults using the Andersen's behavioural model.Individual-level data from 27,017 adults residents in the State capitals who were interviewed in the 2013 Brazilian National Health Survey were pooled with contextual city-level data. The outcomes were non-utilisation of dental services and last dental visit over 12 months ago. Individual predisposing variables were age, sex, race/skin colour, schooling and social network. Individual enabling variables included income, health insurance and registration in primary health care. Individual need variables were self-perceived dental health and self-reported missing teeth. Multilevel logistic regression models were performed to estimate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of the association of contextual and individual predisposing, enabling and need-related variables with dental services outcomes.Predisposing (OR = 0.89; 95% CI 0.81-0.97) and enabling (OR = 0.90; 95% CI 0.85-0.96) contextual factors were associated with non-utilisation of dental services. Individual predisposing (sex, race/skin colour, schooling), enabling (income, health insurance) and need (self-perceived oral health, missing teeth) were associated with non-utilisation of dental services and last dental visit over 12 months ago. The latter was also associated with other individual predisposing (age, social network) and need (eating difficulties due to oral problems) characteristics.Individual and contextual determinants influenced dental services utilisation in Brazilian adults. These factors should be on the policy agenda and considered in the organisation of health services aiming to reduce oral health inequalities related to access and utilisation of dental services."
https://openalex.org/W2786549807,"The existence of cytosine methylation in mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a controversial subject. Because detection of DNA methylation depends on resistance of 5’-modified cytosines to bisulfite-catalyzed conversion to uracil, examined parameters that affect technical adequacy of mtDNA methylation analysis. Negative control amplicons (NCAs) devoid of cytosine methylation were amplified to cover the entire human or mouse mtDNA by long-range PCR. When the pyrosequencing template amplicons were gel-purified after bisulfite conversion, bisulfite pyrosequencing of NCAs did not detect significant levels of bisulfite-resistant cytosines (brCs) at ND1 (7 CpG sites) or CYTB (8 CpG sites) genes (CI95 = 0%-0.94%); without gel-purification, significant false-positive brCs were detected from NCAs (CI95 = 4.2%-6.8%). Bisulfite pyrosequencing of highly purified, linearized mtDNA isolated from human iPS cells or mouse liver detected significant brCs (~30%) in human ND1 gene when the sequencing primer was not selective in bisulfite-converted and unconverted templates. However, repeated experiments using a sequencing primer selective in bisulfite-converted templates almost completely (< 0.8%) suppressed brC detection, supporting the false-positive nature of brCs detected using the non-selective primer. Bisulfite-seq deep sequencing of linearized, gel-purified human mtDNA detected 9.4%-14.8% brCs for 9 CpG sites in ND1 gene. However, because all these brCs were associated with adjacent non-CpG brCs showing the same degrees of bisulfite resistance, DNA methylation in this mtDNA-encoded gene was not confirmed. Without linearization, data generated by bisulfite pyrosequencing or deep sequencing of purified mtDNA templates did not pass the quality control criteria. Shotgun bisulfite sequencing of human mtDNA detected extremely low levels of CpG methylation (<0.65%) over non-CpG methylation (<0.55%). Taken together, our study demonstrates that adequacy of mtDNA methylation analysis using methods dependent on bisulfite conversion needs to be established for each experiment, taking effects of incomplete bisulfite conversion and template impurity or topology into consideration."

https://openalex.org/W2790550496,"Previous literature suggests that a disturbed ability to accurately identify own body size may contribute to overweight. Here, we investigated the influence of personal body size, indexed by body mass index (BMI), on body size estimation in a non-clinical population of females varying in BMI. We attempted to disentangle general biases in body size estimates and attitudinal influences by manipulating whether participants believed the body stimuli (personalized avatars with realistic weight variations) represented their own body or that of another person. Our results show that the accuracy of own body size estimation is predicted by personal BMI, such that participants with lower BMI underestimated their body size and participants with higher BMI overestimated their body size. Further, participants with higher BMI were less likely to notice the same percentage of weight gain than participants with lower BMI. Importantly, these results were only apparent when participants were judging a virtual body that was their own identity (Experiment 1), but not when they estimated the size of a body with another identity and the same underlying body shape (Experiment 2a). The different influences of BMI on accuracy of body size estimation and sensitivity to weight change for self and other identity suggests that effects of BMI on visual body size estimation are self-specific and not generalizable to other bodies."
https://openalex.org/W2791384215,"With the increased use of data not originally recorded for research, such as routine care data (or ‘big data’), measurement error is bound to become an increasingly relevant problem in medical research. A common view among medical researchers on the influence of random measurement error (i.e. classical measurement error) is that its presence leads to some degree of systematic underestimation of studied exposure-outcome relations (i.e. attenuation of the effect estimate). For the common situation where the analysis involves at least one exposure and one confounder, we demonstrate that the direction of effect of random measurement error on the estimated exposure-outcome relations can be difficult to anticipate. Using three example studies on cardiovascular risk factors, we illustrate that random measurement error in the exposure and/or confounder can lead to underestimation as well as overestimation of exposure-outcome relations. We therefore advise medical researchers to refrain from making claims about the direction of effect of measurement error in their manuscripts, unless the appropriate inferential tools are used to study or alleviate the impact of measurement error from the analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2787197940,"Principal basolateral amygdala (BL) neurons profoundly influence motivated behaviors, yet few of them are activated by emotionally valenced stimuli. Here, we show that a likely explanation for this paradox is the synchronizing influence of the high-gamma rhythm. High-gamma (75–95 Hz) entrained BL firing more strongly than all other rhythms. It was most pronounced during states of increased vigilance, when rats were apprehensive. Relative to behavioral states, high-gamma produced minor changes in firing rates yet dramatic increases in synchrony. Moreover, connected pairs of cells showed similarly high levels of entrainment and synchronization. Unexpectedly, prefrontal- and accumbens-projecting cells, respectively, showed high and low entrainment by high-gamma, indicating that this rhythm differentially synchronizes the activity of BL neurons projecting to specific sites. Overall, our findings suggest that individual BL neurons encode information not only by changing their firing rates, but also by synchronizing their collective activity, amplifying their impact on target structures."
https://openalex.org/W2787771062,"Aims Insulin resistance is the pathophysiological precursor of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM-2), and its relationship with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been widely studied in patients with obesity or metabolic syndrome using not only ultrasound but also liver biopsies or proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H1-MRS) to assess liver fat content. In contrast, there are no studies on insulin resistance and NAFLD in lean or overweight Caucasian individuals using H1-MRS or liver biopsies for the quantification of hepatic triglyceride content. Our objectives were to study the presence of insulin resistance in lean and overweight Caucasian adults and investigate its possible relationship with liver triglyceride content, waist circumference (as proxy of visceral adiposity), BMI, and cardiometabolic risk factors. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 113 non-obese, non-diabetic individuals classified as overweight (BMI 25–29.9 kg/m2) or lean (BMI 19.5–24.9 kg/m2). Hepatic triglyceride content was quantified by 3T H1-MRS. NAFLD was defined as hepatic triglyceride content >5.56%. Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), serum adiponectin, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were determined. Results HOMA-IR was significantly correlated with hepatic triglyceride content (r:0.76; p<0.0001). The lean-with-NAFLD group had significantly higher HOMA-IR (p<0.001) and lower serum adiponectin (p<0.05) than the overweight-without-NAFLD group. Insulin resistance was independently associated with NAFLD but not with waist circumference or BMI. Regression analysis showed hepatic triglyceride content to be the most important determinant of insulin resistance (p<0.01). Conclusions Our findings suggest that NAFLD, once established, seems to be involved in insulin resistance and cardio-metabolic risk factors above and beyond waist circumference and BMI in non-obese, non-diabetic Caucasian individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2786175404,"As a master regulator of endothelial cell function, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) activates multiple downstream signaling pathways that are critical for vascular development and normal vessel function. VEGFR2 trafficking through various endosomal compartments modulates its signaling output. Accordingly, proteins that regulate the speed and direction by which VEGFR2 traffics through endosomes have been demonstrated to be particularly important for arteriogenesis. However, little is known about how these proteins control VEGFR2 trafficking and about the implications of this control for endothelial cell function. Here, we show that Rab GTPase–binding effector protein 2 (RABEP2), a Rab-effector protein implicated in arteriogenesis, modulates VEGFR2 trafficking. By employing high-resolution microscopy and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that RABEP2 interacts with the small GTPase Rab4 and regulates VEGFR2 endosomal trafficking to maintain cell-surface expression of VEGFR2 and VEGF signaling. Lack of RABEP2 also led to prolonged retention of VEGFR2 in Rab5-positive sorting endosomes, which increased VEGFR2’s exposure to phosphotyrosine phosphatase 1b (PTP1b), causing diminished VEGFR2 signaling. Finally, the loss of RABEP2 increased VEGFR2 degradation by diverting VEGFR2 to Rab7-positive endosomes destined for the lysosome. These results implicate RABEP2 as a key modulator of VEGFR2 endosomal trafficking, and demonstrate the importance of RABEP2 and Rab4 for VEGFR2 signaling in endothelial cells.

In succession to T20, T1249 has been designed as a 39-mer peptide composed of amino acid sequences derived from HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV); however, its development has been suspended due to formulation difficulties. We recently developed a T20-based lipopeptide (LP-40) showing greatly improved pharmaceutical properties. Here, we generated a T1249-based lipopeptide, termed LP-46, by replacing its C-terminal tryptophan-rich sequence with fatty acid. As compared with T20, T1249, and LP-40, the truncated LP-46 (31-mer) had dramatically increased activities in inhibiting a large panel of HIV-1 subtypes, with IC50 values approaching low picomolar concentrations. Also, LP-46 was an exceptionally potent inhibitor against HIV-2, SIV, and T20-resistant variants, and it displayed obvious synergistic effects with LP-40. Furthermore, we showed that LP-46 had increased helical stability and binding affinity with the target site. The crystal structure of LP-46 in complex with a target surrogate revealed its critical binding motifs underlying the mechanism of action. Interestingly, it was found that the introduced pocket-binding domain in LP-46 did not interact with the gp41 pocket as expected; instead, it adopted a mode similar to that of LP-40. Therefore, our studies have provided an exceptionally potent and broad fusion inhibitor for developing new anti-HIV drugs, which can also serve as a tool to exploit the mechanisms of viral fusion and inhibition.

Binding of the surface subunit gp120 to the cell receptor CD4 along with a chemokine receptor (CCR5 or CXCR4) triggers a series of conformational changes in the gp120/gp41 complex and further activates the fusogenic activity of the transmembrane subunit gp41.

Then the C-terminal heptad repeats (CHR) of gp41 collapse in an antiparallel fashion into the inner hydrophobic grooves created by the trimeric N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) helices, leading a stable six-helix bundle (6-HB) that pulls two membranes into close proximity for fusion (4Chan D.C.

As depicted in Fig. 1, it is a 39-amino acid polypeptide composed of mixed amino acid sequences derived from HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV strains. Specially, T1249 contains three discontinuous functional sites based on their positioning on the NHR target: an introduced PBD at its N terminus, an NHR-binding sequence (CHR core) in the middle site, and a tryptophan-rich motif (TRM) at the C terminus. Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrated that T1249 exhibited significantly increased antiviral activity, including its inhibition on T20-resistant HIV-1 mutants and HIV-2 isolates (28Lalezari J.P.

Unfortunately, T1249 underwent considerable difficulties of formulation and production, and thus its clinical development was halted. Nevertheless, its unique structure and antiviral spectrum remain highly attractive for exploring the mechanisms of viral fusion and inhibition and as a template to design new fusion inhibitors. Earlier works demonstrate that genetically anchoring fusion inhibitor peptides to the membrane of target cells can greatly increase the antiviral activity (32Hildinger M. Dittmar M.T.

It is thought that the resulting lipopeptides can interact with the cell membranes, thus raising the local concentration of the inhibitors at the fusion site (34Ingallinella P. Bianchi E. Ladwa N.A.

By conjugating different lipids (fatty acid, cholesterol, sphingolipids) to the C terminus of short peptides that mainly target the NHR pocket site, we previously developed the lipopeptides LP-11 and LP-19 (Fig. 1), which did show markedly increased anti-HIV potency and in vivo half-lives (36Chong H. Wu X. Su Y. He Y. Development of potent and long-acting HIV-1 fusion inhibitors.AIDS. 2016; 30 (26919736): 1187-119610.1097/QAD.0000000000001073Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 37Chong H.

Promisingly, a short-term monotherapy of LP-19 could reduce viral loads to undetectable levels in both acutely and chronically simian-human immunodeficiency virus–infected rhesus monkeys (37Chong H. Xue J. Xiong S. Cong Z. Ding X. Zhu Y. Liu Z. Chen T. Feng Y. He L. Guo Y. Wei Q. Zhou Y. Qin C. He Y.

Very recently, we developed a T20-based lipopeptide termed LP-40, which demonstrated a binding mode different from that of LP-11 and LP-19 (40Ding X. Zhang X. Chong H. Zhu Y. Wei H. Wu X. He J. Wang X. He Y. Enfuvirtide (T20)-based lipopeptide is a potent HIV-1 cell fusion inhibitor: implication for viral entry and inhibition.J. Virol. 2017; 91 (28659478): e00831-00817Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LP-40 was more potent than LP-11 in inhibiting HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion, whereas it was less active at inhibiting viral entry, and the two classes of inhibitors displayed synergistic and complementary antiviral effects. However, LP-40 had no appreciable improvement on T20-resistant mutants and HIV-2 isolates. In this study, we focused on developing a more potent and broad viral fusion inhibitor by using T1249 as a template. A novel lipopeptide, termed LP-46, was created by replacing its TRM with a C16 fatty acid group. Impressively, LP-46 showed exceptionally potent activities in inhibiting HIV-1, HIV-2, SIV, and T20-resistant viruses and displayed synergistic effects with LP-40. Consistent with its inhibitory activity, LP-46 had greatly increased helical stability and binding affinity with the target site. The crystal structure of LP-46 revealed that the introduced PBD in the N terminus of LP-46 did not bind to the hydrophobic pocket site as expected but rather adopted a binding mode, as did LP-40. Therefore, our studies have generated the most potent and broad HIV-1/2 and SIV fusion inhibitor known to date, which not only provides an ideal candidate for drug development, but also serves as a critical tool to investigate the mechanisms of viral fusion and inhibition. We recently verified the importance of the TRM in T20 for its anti-HIV activity (40Ding X. Zhang X. Chong H. Zhu Y. Wei H. Wu X. He J. Wang X. He Y. Enfuvirtide (T20)-based lipopeptide is a potent HIV-1 cell fusion inhibitor: implication for viral entry and inhibition.J. Virol. 2017; 91 (28659478): e00831-00817Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To validate the function of the TRM in T1249, we synthesized the truncated peptide T1249-TRM by deleting the TRM from T1249 (Fig. 1), and their antiviral activities were compared with three replicative HIV-1 strains. As expected, T1249-TRM showed a markedly decreased inhibitory activity (Fig. 2). Specifically, T1249 inhibited NL4-3 (subtype B, X4), JRCSF (subtype B, R5), and R3A (subtype B, R5X4) with mean 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 3.3, 1.67, and 2.36 nm, respectively, whereas T1249-TRM had mean IC50 of 181.6, 41.73, and 10.83 nm, respectively. To develop a more efficient fusion inhibitor, we generated the lipopeptide LP-46 by replacing the TRM of T1249 with a C16 fatty acid, and its anti-HIV activity was then determined. Impressively, LP-46 inhibited NL4-3, JRCSF, and R3A with mean IC50 of 0.03, 0.05, and 0.06 nm, respectively, which were 110-, 33.4-, and 39.33-fold, respectively, lower than T1249. Moreover, a flexible linker (8-unit polyethylene glycol, PEG8) was introduced between the peptide sequence and the lipid moiety of LP-46; however, the resulting lipopeptide LP-47 showed an obviously reduced inhibitory activity, suggesting that a linker is not required for the antiviral activity of LP-46, similar to the T20-based lipopeptide LP-40. We further compared the inhibitory activities of T1249 and LP-46 against Env-mediated virus entry and cell-cell fusion. Here, T20 and LP-40 were included as controls. As shown in Fig. 3, LP-46 inhibited NL4-3 pseudovirus entry with a mean IC50 of 0.02 nm, which was 4460.5-fold lower than T20 (89.21 nm), 181-fold lower than T1249 (3.62 nm), and 1368-fold lower than LP-40 (27.36 nm). LP-46 inhibited HXB2 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion with a mean IC50 of 0.09 nm, which was 202.56-fold lower than T20 (18.23 nm), 103.56-fold lower than T1249 (9.32 nm), and 2.56-fold lower than LP-40 (0.23 nm). Meanwhile, the cytotoxicity of T1249 and LP-46 was determined, which indicated that both inhibitors had a 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of greater than 140 μm, suggesting an extremely high therapeutic selectivity index (CC50/IC50 ratio). HIV-1 evolves with great genetic diversity and can be classified into multiple groups and subtypes, including the subtype A, B, and C viruses that dominate the AIDS epidemic worldwide and the recombinant viruses of CRF01A_E and CRF07B_C that are currently circulating in China. To further validate the antiviral activity of LP-46, we constructed a large group of pseudoviruses with diverse subtypes of viral Envs, including a so-called “global panel” recently selected based on the genetic and antigenic variability of the viral Envs representing the global AIDS epidemic (41deCamp A.

For comparison, the inhibitory activities of T20, T1249, and LP-40 were also determined by single-cycle infection assays. As shown in Table 1, LP-46 inhibited diverse HIV-1 isolates with a mean IC50 of 0.08 nm, which was 334.13-fold lower than T20 (26.73 nm), 43-fold lower than T1249 (3.44 nm), and 49.25-fold lower than LP-40 (3.94 nm).Table 1Inhibitory activities of LP-46 and control peptides against primary HIV-1 isolatesPrimary EnvSubtypeIC50T20T1249LP-40LP-46nm92RW020A2.03 ± 0.932.48 ± 0.041.2 ± 0.220.08 ± 092UG037.8A9.58 ± 3.852.93 ± 0.284.27 ± 2.160.06 ± 0398-F1_F6_20A22.51 ± 7.171.36 ± 0.125.49 ± 0.770.03 ± 0AC10.0.29B1.86 ± 1.210.96 ± 0.111.35 ± 0.290.04 ± 0SC422661.8B13.26 ± 8.570.89 ± 0.115.08 ± 2.440.04 ± 0X2278_C2_B6B6.01 ± 1.242.74 ± 0.031.35 ± 0.440.03 ± 0TRO.11B7.4 ± 3.32.92 ± 0.112.03 ± 0.290.06 ± 0.02B02B′11.69 ± 1.174.4 ± 0.081.01 ± 0.160.09 ± 0.01B04B′5.05 ± 2.751.86 ± 0.271.34 ± 0.140.08 ± 0CAP45.2.00.G3C126.8 ± 28.832.48 ± 0.113.59 ± 1.390.07 ± 0.01ZM53M.PB12C16.66 ± 3.422.68 ± 0.283.39 ± 0.350.08 ± 0.01"

The majority of viruses are found in few individuals, with single occurrences being the most widespread ones, whereas universally distributed viruses, while present, are relatively rare, with bacteriophages from families Siphoviridae and Myoviridae, and Streptococcus phages, as well as the eukaryotic viral family Herpesviridae amongst the most widespread viruses. No significant differences were found between females and males for either viruses and bacteria in abundance and alpha and beta diversity.

https://openalex.org/W2790181710,"This work focuses on kinetic aspects of stability, mobility, and dissolution of bare Cu, Al and Mn, and SiO2 NPs in synthetic freshwater (FW) with and without the presence of natural organic matter (NOM). This includes elucidation of particle and surface interactions, metal dissolution kinetics, and speciation predictions of released metals in solution. Dihydroxy benzoic acid (DHBA) and humic acid adsorbed rapidly on all metal NPs (<1 min) via multiple surface coordinations, followed in general by rapid agglomeration and concomitant sedimentation for a large fraction of the particles. In contrast, NOM did not induce agglomeration of the SiO2 NPs during the test duration (21 days). DHBA in concentrations of 0.1 and 1 mM was unable to stabilize the metal NPs for time periods longer than 6 h, whereas humic acid, at certain concentrations (20 mg/L) was more efficient (>24 h). The presence of NOM increased the amount of released metals into solution, in particular for Al and Cu, whereas the effect for Mn was minor. At least 10% of the particle mass was dissolved within 24 h and remained in solution for the metal NPs in the presence of NOM. Speciation modeling revealed that released Al and Cu predominantly formed complexes with NOM, whereas less complexation was seen for Mn. The results imply that potentially dispersed NPs of Cu, Al and Mn readily dissolve or sediment close to the source in freshwater of low salinity, whereas SiO2 NPs are more stable and therefore more mobile in solution."
https://openalex.org/W2790789648,"Introduction We have previously developed a portable Pocket Colposcope for cervical cancer screening in resource-limited settings. In this manuscript we report two different strategies (cross-polarization and an integrated reflector) to improve image contrast levels achieved with the Pocket Colposcope and evaluate the merits of each strategy compared to a standard-of-care digital colposcope. The desired outcomes included reduced specular reflection (glare), increased illumination beam pattern uniformity, and reduced electrical power budget. In addition, anti-fogging and waterproofing features were incorporated to prevent the Pocket Colposcope from fogging in the vaginal canal and to enable rapid disinfection by submersion in chemical agents. Methods Cross-polarization (Generation 3 Pocket Colposcope) and a new reflector design (Generation 4 Pocket Colposcope) were used to reduce glare and improve contrast. The reflector design (including the angle and height of the reflector sidewalls) was optimized through ray-tracing simulations. Both systems were characterized with a series of bench tests to assess specular reflection, beam pattern uniformity, and image contrast. A pilot clinical study was conducted to compare the Generation 3 and 4 Pocket Colposcopes to a standard-of-care colposcope (Leisegang Optik 2). Specifically, paired images of cervices were collected from the standard-of-care colposcope and either the Generation 3 (n = 24 patients) or the Generation 4 (n = 32 patients) Pocket Colposcopes. The paired images were blinded by device, randomized, and sent to an expert physician who provided a diagnosis for each image. Corresponding pathology was obtained for all image pairs. The primary outcome measures were the level of agreement (%) and κ (kappa) statistic between the standard-of-care colposcope and each Pocket Colposcope (Generation 3 and Generation 4). Results Both generations of Pocket Colposcope had significantly higher image contrast when compared to the standard-of-care colposcope. The addition of anti-fog and waterproofing features to the Generation 3 and 4 Pocket Colposcope did not impact image quality based on qualitative and quantitative metrics. The level of agreement between the Generation 3 Pocket Colposcope and the standard-of-care colposcope was 75.0% (kappa = 0.4000, p = 0.0028, n = 24). This closely matched the level of agreement between the Generation 4 Pocket Colposcope and the standard-of-care colposcope which was also 75.0% (kappa = 0.4941, p = 0.0024, n = 32). Conclusion Our results indicate that the Generation 3 and 4 Pocket Colposcopes perform comparably to the standard-of-care colposcope, with the added benefit of being low-cost and waterproof, which is ideal for use in resource-limited settings. Additionally, the reflector significantly reduces the electrical requirements of the Generation 4 Pocket Colposcope enhancing portability without altering performance compared to the Generation 3 system."
https://openalex.org/W2793835297,"Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) are promising targets for antibody-based cancer therapies, as their substantial overexpression has been found in various tumor cells. Aberrant activation of FGF receptor 2 (FGFR2) signaling through overexpression of FGFR2 and/or its ligands, mutations, or receptor amplification has been reported in multiple cancer types, including gastric, colorectal, endometrial, ovarian, breast and lung cancer. In this paper, we describe application of the phage display technology to produce a panel of high affinity single chain variable antibody fragments (scFvs) against the extracellular ligand-binding domain of FGFR2 (ECD_FGFR2). The binders were selected from the human single chain variable fragment scFv phage display libraries Tomlinson I + J and showed high specificity and binding affinity towards human FGFR2 with nanomolar KD values. To improve the affinity of the best binder selected, scFvF7, we reformatted it to a bivalent diabody format, or fused it with the Fc region (scFvF7-Fc). The scFvF7-Fc antibody construct presented the highest affinity for FGFR2, with a KD of 0.76 nM, and was selectively internalized into cancer cells overexpressing FGFR2, Snu-16 and NCI-H716. Finally, we prepared a conjugate of scFvF7-Fc with the cytotoxic drug monomethyl-auristatin E (MMAE) and evaluated its cytotoxicity. The conjugate delivered MMAE selectively to FGFR2-positive tumor cells. These results indicate that scFvF7-Fc-vcMMAE is a highly potent molecule for the treatment of cancers with FGFR2 overexpression."
https://openalex.org/W2787780310,"Dihydroxyacid dehydratase (DHAD) is the third enzyme required for branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis in bacteria, fungi, and plants. DHAD enzymes contain two distinct types of active-site Fe–S clusters. The best characterized examples are Escherichia coli DHAD, which contains an oxygen-labile [Fe4S4] cluster, and spinach DHAD, which contains an oxygen-resistant [Fe2S2] cluster. Although the Fe–S cluster is crucial for DHAD function, little is known about the cluster-coordination environment or the mechanism of catalysis and cluster biogenesis. Here, using the combination of UV-visible absorption and circular dichroism and resonance Raman and electron paramagnetic resonance, we spectroscopically characterized the Fe–S center in DHAD from Arabidopsis thaliana (At). Our results indicated that AtDHAD can accommodate [Fe2S2] and [Fe4S4] clusters. However, only the [Fe2S2] cluster–bound form is catalytically active. We found that the [Fe2S2] cluster is coordinated by at least one non-cysteinyl ligand, which can be replaced by the thiol group(s) of dithiothreitol. In vitro cluster transfer and reconstitution reactions revealed that [Fe2S2] cluster–containing NFU2 protein is likely the physiological cluster donor for in vivo maturation of AtDHAD. In summary, AtDHAD binds either one [Fe4S4] or one [Fe2S2] cluster, with only the latter being catalytically competent and capable of substrate and product binding, and NFU2 appears to be the physiological [Fe2S2] cluster donor for DHAD maturation. This work represents the first in vitro characterization of recombinant AtDHAD, providing new insights into the properties, biogenesis, and catalytic role of the active-site Fe–S center in a plant DHAD."
https://openalex.org/W2785407911,"Despite the abundance of recent publications about mind wandering (i.e., off-task thought), its interconnection with metacognition and cognitive control has not yet been examined. In the current study, we hypothesized that these three constructs would show clear interrelations. Metacognitive capacity was predicted to correlate positively with cognitive control ability, which in turn was predicted to be positively related to resistance to mind wandering during sustained attention. Moreover, it was expected that participants with good metacognitive capacity would be better at the subjective recognition of behaviorally present mind wandering. Three tasks were used: The Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) to measure mind wandering, a perceptual decision task with confidence ratings to measure metacognitive efficiency, and a conflict task to measure cognitive control. Structural Equation Modelling was used to test the interrelations among the three constructs. As expected, metacognitive efficiency was positively related to cognitive control ability. Surprisingly, there was a negative relation between metacognitive efficiency and the degree to which subjective mind wandering reports tracked the behavioral index of mind wandering. No relation was found between cognitive control and behavioral mind wandering. The results of the current work are the first to shed light on the interrelations among these three constructs."
https://openalex.org/W2787811994,"Neighbourhood effects studies have demonstrated an association between area deprivation and smoking behaviour whereby people living in deprived neighbourhoods are more likely to smoke than those in non-deprived neighbourhoods. This evidence though is based largely upon data that ignores long term exposures to neighbourhood contexts and is confounded by neighbourhood selection bias. In this study, we investigate the temporal ordering of exposure to neighbourhood deprivation throughout childhood and whether associations between neighbourhood deprivation and cigarette smoking are due to compositional or contextual neighbourhood effects. Data come from a UK cohort study, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). We use longitudinal measures of neighbourhood deprivation and self-reported smoking behaviour for 2744 children to examine the influence of neighbourhood deprivation on smoking status and smoking heaviness at age 17. Our results demonstrate that children who are born into and grow up in deprived neighbourhoods are up to twice as likely to be smokers at age 17 than those in non-deprived neighbourhoods. These associations are largely due to family socioeconomic position and the intergenerational transmission of smoking behaviour from parents to children; compositional rather than direct contextual ‘neighbourhood effects’. Our findings highlight the importance of considering longitudinal exposure to neighbourhood deprivation over cross sectional exposure. In conclusion, we find that it is the family rather than the neighbourhood into which a child is born that determines their smoking behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2792067209,"Manganese (Mn) is an essential micro-nutrient for plants, but flooded rice fields can accumulate high levels of Mn2+ leading to Mn toxicity. Here, we present a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify candidate loci conferring Mn toxicity tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.). A diversity panel of 288 genotypes was grown in hydroponic solutions in a greenhouse under optimal and toxic Mn concentrations. We applied a Mn toxicity treatment (5 ppm Mn2+, 3 weeks) at twelve days after transplanting. Mn toxicity caused moderate damage in rice in terms of biomass loss and symptom formation despite extremely high shoot Mn concentrations ranging from 2.4 to 17.4 mg g-1. The tropical japonica subpopulation was more sensitive to Mn toxicity than other subpopulations. Leaf damage symptoms were significantly correlated with Mn uptake into shoots. Association mapping was conducted for seven traits using 416741 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers using a mixed linear model, and detected six significant associations for the traits shoot manganese concentration and relative shoot length. Candidate regions contained genes coding for a heavy metal transporter, peroxidase precursor and Mn2+ ion binding proteins. The significant marker SNP-2.22465867 caused an amino acid change in a gene (LOC_Os02g37170) with unknown function. This study demonstrated significant natural variation in rice for Mn toxicity tolerance and the possibility of using GWAS to unravel genetic factors responsible for such complex traits."
https://openalex.org/W2794358036,"The choice of areas for nature conservation involves the attempt to maximize the benefits, whether by carrying out an economic activity or by the provision of Ecosystem Services. Studies are needed to improve the understanding of the effect of the extent and position along the watershed of restored areas on soil and water conservation. This study aimed to understand how different restoration strategies might reflect in soil conservation and sediment retention. Using InVEST tool, sediment transport was simulated in a small 12 km2 watershed (Posses River, in Southeast Brazil), where one of first Brazilian Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) projects is being carried out, comparing different hypothetical restoration strategies. With 25% of restoration, sediment export decreased by 78% for riparian restoration, and 27% for the steepest slopes restoration. On the other hand, the decrease in soil loss was lower for riparian restoration, with a 16% decrease, while the steepest slopes restoration reduced it by 21%. This mismatch between the reduction of sediment export and soil loss was explained by the fact that forest not only reduces soil loss locally but also traps sediment arriving from the upper parts of the watershed. While the first mechanism is important to provide soil stability, decreasing the risk of landslip, and to maintain agricultural productivity, the second can improve water quality and decrease the risk of silting, with positive effects on the water reservoirs at the outlet of the watershed. This suggests that Riparian and the Steepest Slopes restoration strategies are complementary in the sense of preventing sediments from reaching the water bodies as well as protecting them at their origin (with the reduction of erosion), so it will be advisable to consider the two types of restoration."
https://openalex.org/W2793069083,"Background Most of general practitioners (GPs) use advertising in their waiting rooms for patient’s education purposes. Patients vaccinated against seasonal influenza have been gradually lessening. The objective of this trial was to assess the effect of an advertising campaign for influenza vaccination using posters and pamphlets in GPs’ waiting rooms. Methods and findings Registry based 2/1 cluster randomized controlled trial, a cluster gathering the enlisted patients of 75 GPs aged over 16 years. The trial, run during the 2014–2015 influenza vaccination campaign, compared patient’s awareness from being in 50 GPs’ standard waiting rooms (control group) versus that of waiting in 25 rooms from GPs who had received and exposed pamphlets and one poster on influenza vaccine (intervention group), in addition to standard mandatory information. The main outcome was the number of vaccination units delivered in pharmacies. Data were extracted from the SIAM-ERASME claim database of the Health Insurance Fund of Lille-Douai (France). The association between the intervention (yes/no) and the main outcome was assessed through a generalized estimating equation. Seventy-five GPs enrolled 10,597 patients over 65 years or suffering from long lasting diseases (intervention/control as of 3781/6816 patients) from October 15, 2014 to February 28, 2015. No difference was found regarding the number of influenza vaccination units delivered (Relative Risk (RR) = 1.01; 95% Confidence interval: 0.97 to 1.05; p = 0.561). Conclusion Effects of the monothematic campaign promoting vaccination against influenza using a poster and pamphlets exposed in GPs’ waiting rooms could not be demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W2950459609,"Action potentials can be recorded extracellularly from hundreds of neurons simultaneously with multi-electrode arrays. These can typically have as many as 120 or more electrodes. The brief duration of action potentials requires a high sampling frequency to reliably capture each waveform. The resulting raw data files are therefore large and difficult to visualize with traditional plotting tools. Common approaches to deal with the difficulties of data display, such as extracting spike times and performing spike train analysis, are useful in many contexts but they also significantly reduce data dimensionality. The use of tools which minimize data processing enable the development of heuristic perspective of experimental results. Here we introduce MEA Viewer, a high-performance open source application for the direct visualization of multi-channel electrophysiological data. MEA Viewer includes several high-performance visualizations, including an easily navigable overview of recorded extracellular action potentials from all data channels overlaid with spike timestamp data and an interactive raster plot. MEA Viewer can also display the two dimensional extent of action potential propagation in single neurons by signal averaging extracellular action potentials (eAPs) from single neurons detected on multiple electrodes. This view extracts and displays eAP timing information and eAP waveforms that are otherwise below the spike detection threshold. This entirely new method of using MEAs opens up novel research applications for medium density arrays. MEA Viewer is licensed under the General Public License version 3, GPLv3, and is available at http://github.com/dbridges/mea-tools."
https://openalex.org/W2791815012,"Morphological microscopic examinations of nucleated cells in body fluid (BF) samples are performed to screen malignancy. However, the morphological differentiation is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This study aimed to develop a new flowcytometry-based gating analysis mode “XN-BF gating algorithm” to detect malignant cells using an automated hematology analyzer, Sysmex XN-1000. XN-BF mode was equipped with WDF white blood cell (WBC) differential channel. We added two algorithms to the WDF channel: Rule 1 detects larger and clumped cell signals compared to the leukocytes, targeting the clustered malignant cells; Rule 2 detects middle sized mononuclear cells containing less granules than neutrophils with similar fluorescence signal to monocytes, targeting hematological malignant cells and solid tumor cells. BF samples that meet, at least, one rule were detected as malignant. To evaluate this novel gating algorithm, 92 various BF samples were collected. Manual microscopic differentiation with the May-Grunwald Giemsa stain and WBC count with hemocytometer were also performed. The performance of these three methods were evaluated by comparing with the cytological diagnosis. The XN-BF gating algorithm achieved sensitivity of 63.0% and specificity of 87.8% with 68.0% for positive predictive value and 85.1% for negative predictive value in detecting malignant-cell positive samples. Manual microscopic WBC differentiation and WBC count demonstrated 70.4% and 66.7% of sensitivities, and 96.9% and 92.3% of specificities, respectively. The XN-BF gating algorithm can be a feasible tool in hematology laboratories for prompt screening of malignant cells in various BF samples."
https://openalex.org/W2790108980,"The development of genetic markers for animal breeding is an effective strategy to reduce the time and cost required to improve economically important traits. To implement genomic selection in the multibreed chicken population of Korea, an understanding of the linkage disequilibrium (LD) status of the target population is essential. In this study, we performed population genetic analyses to investigate LD decay, the effective population size, and breed diversity using 600K high-density single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes of 189 native chickens in 14 lines (including Korean native chicken, imported and adapted purebred and commercial chickens). The results indicated that commercial native chickens have less calculated LD (average, r2 = 0.13–0.26) and purebred native chickens have more calculated LD (average, r2 = 0.24–0.37) across the entire genome. The effective population sizes of the examined lines showed patterns opposite to those of population LD. The phylogeny and admixture analyses showed that commercial and purebred chickens were well distinguished, except for Rhode Island Red (RIR) purebred lines of NC (NIAS_RIR_C) and ND (NIAS_RIR_D). These lines are difficult to distinguish clearly because they originated from the same respective breeds. The results of this study may provide important information for the development of genetic markers that can be used in breeding to improve the economic traits of native chickens."
https://openalex.org/W2786502063,"Patients with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck region (HNSCC) are at risk for disease recurrence and metastases, even after initial successful therapy. A tissue-based biomarker could be beneficial to guide treatment as well as post-treatment surveillance. Gene methylation status has been recently identified as powerful prognostic biomarker in HNSCC. We therefore evaluated the methylation status of the homeobox gene PITX1 and the adjacent long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) C5orf66-AS1 in publicly available datasets.Gene methylation and expression data from 528 patients with HNSCC included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, there obtained by using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip Kit) were evaluated and methylation and expression levels of PITX1 and lincRNA C5orf66-AS1 was correlated with overall survival and other parameters. Thus, ten beads targeting PITX1 exon 3 and three beads targeting lincRNA C5orf66-AS1 were identified as significant candidates. The mean methylation of these beads was used for further correlation and the median was employed for dichotomization.Both PITX1 exon 3 and lincRNA C5orf66-AS1 were significantly higher methylated in tumor tissue than in normal adjacent tissue (NAT) (PITX1 exon 3: tumor tissue 58.1%, NAT: 31.7%, p<0.001; lincRNA C5orf66-AS1: tumor tissue: 27.4%, NAT: 18.9%, p<0.001). In a univariate analysis, hypermethylation of both loci was significantly associated with the risk of death (univariate: exon 3: Hazard ratio (HR): 4.97 [1.78-16.71], p = 0.010, lincRNA C5orf66-AS1: Hazard ratio (HR): 12.23 [3.01-49.74], p<0.001). PITX1 exon 3 and lincRNA C5orf66-AS1 methylation was also significantly correlated with tumor localization, T category, human papilloma virus (HPV)-negative and p16-negative tumors and tumor grade. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed, that lincRNA C5orf66-AS1 hypomethylation was significantly associated with overall survival (p = 0.001) in the entire cohort as well in a subgroup of HPV-negative tumors (p = 0.003) and in patients with laryngeal tumors (p = 0.022).Methylation status of PITX1 and even more so of lincRNA C5orf66-AS1 is a promising prognostic biomarker in HNSCC, in particular for HPV-negative patients. Further prospective evaluation is warranted."

Twinfilin is an evolutionarily conserved protein that contributes to cytoskeletal dynamics by interacting with actin monomers, filaments, and the heterodimeric capping protein. Twinfilin also binds phosphoinositides, which inhibit its interactions with actin, but the underlying mechanism has remained unknown. Here, we show that the high-affinity binding site of twinfilin for phosphoinositides is located at the C-terminal tail region, whereas the two actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin–like ADF homology domains of twinfilin bind phosphoinositides only with low affinity. Mutagenesis and biochemical experiments combined with atomistic molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the C-terminal tail of twinfilin interacts with membranes through a multivalent electrostatic interaction with a preference toward phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2), PI(4,5)P2, and PI(3,4,5)P3. This initial interaction places the actin-binding ADF homology domains of twinfilin in close proximity to the membrane and subsequently promotes their association with the membrane, thus leading to inhibition of the actin interactions. In support of this model, a twinfilin mutant lacking the C-terminal tail inhibits actin filament assembly in a phosphoinositide-insensitive manner. Our mutagenesis data also reveal that the phosphoinositide- and capping protein–binding sites overlap in the C-terminal tail of twinfilin, suggesting that phosphoinositide binding additionally inhibits the interactions of twinfilin with the heterodimeric capping protein. The results demonstrate that the conserved C-terminal tail of twinfilin is a multifunctional binding motif, which is crucial for interaction with the heterodimeric capping protein and for tethering twinfilin to phosphoinositide-rich membranes.

Twinfilins contribute to cytoskeletal dynamics through a complex mechanism that involves interactions with actin monomers, actin filaments, and heterodimeric capping protein. Both yeast and mammalian twinfilins bind ADP-actin monomers with high affinity and inhibit their nucleotide exchange and assembly into filament ends (23Goode B.L. Drubin D.G. Lappalainen P.

J. 2009; 417 (18837697): 593-60010.1042/BJ20080608Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Moreover, the budding yeast twinfilin, together with the cyclase-associated protein, can accelerate actin filament depolymerization from the barbed and pointed ends (37Johnston A.B. Collins A. Goode B.L. High-speed depolymerization at actin filament ends jointly catalysed by twinfilin and Srv2/CAP.Nat.

The high-affinity ADP-actin monomer–binding site is located in the C-terminal ADF-H domain of twinfilin, whereas the presence of both actin-binding ADF-H domains is required for twinfilin’s filament barbed end capping and filament depolymerization activities (34Ojala P.J.

In addition to actin, yeast and mammalian twinfilins interact with the heterodimeric capping protein. Mutagenesis studies demonstrated that the C-terminal tail of twinfilin is critical for interaction with capping protein and for proper subcellular localization of twinfilin in cells (38Palmgren S. Ojala P.J. Wear M.A. Cooper J.A. Lappalainen P. Interactions with PIP2, ADP-actin monomers, and capping protein regulate the activity and localization of yeast twinfilin.J.

However, this interaction does not appear to affect the actin-related activities of twinfilin or capping protein, at least not in vitro, and thus the biological role of the twinfilin-capping protein interaction has remained largely unknown. Budding yeast twinfilin and mammalian twinfilin-1 and twinfilin-2 also interact with phosphoinositides. Interaction with PI(4,5)P2 inhibits the ability of twinfilin to bind actin monomers and decelerate actin filament assembly (25Vartiainen M.K. Sarkkinen E.M. Matilainen T. Salminen M. Lappalainen P. Mammals have two twinfilin isoforms whose subcellular localizations and tissue distributions are differentially regulated.J. Biol.

Hence, similarly to structurally related ADF/cofilins, the actin interactions of twinfilin are inhibited by phosphoinositides (38Palmgren S. Ojala P.J. Wear M.A. Cooper J.A. Lappalainen P. Interactions with PIP2, ADP-actin monomers, and capping protein regulate the activity and localization of yeast twinfilin.J.

However, the mechanism of twinfilin-PI(4,5)P2 interaction and the location of the phosphoinositide-binding site(s) in twinfilin are unknown. Also, the cellular roles and possible effects of the phosphoinositide interaction on other biochemical functions of twinfilin remain to be elucidated. Here, we utilized a combination of mutagenesis and biochemical experiments together with atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to expose how mouse twinfilin-1 (hereafter twinfilin) interacts with phosphoinositide-rich membranes. Our results revealed that twinfilin is initially tethered to the phosphoinositide-rich membrane through its conserved C-terminal tail. Further on, we found that this interaction forces the actin-binding ADF-H domains in close proximity to the membrane and subsequently leads to inactivation of actin binding by twinfilin. Thus, twinfilin utilizes a novel two-step mechanism for interactions with phosphoinositide-rich membranes. Previous studies on twinfilin-phosphoinositide interactions were performed with the non-quantitative native gel electrophoresis approach using micelles comprising only phosphoinositides (25Vartiainen M.K. Sarkkinen E.M. Matilainen T. Salminen M. Lappalainen P. Mammals have two twinfilin isoforms whose subcellular localizations and tissue distributions are differentially regulated.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 (12807912): 34347-3435510.1074/jbc.M303642200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 38Palmgren S. Ojala P.J. Wear M.A. Cooper J.A. Lappalainen P.

Cell Biol. 2001; 155 (11604420): 251-26010.1083/jcb.200106157Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Here, we applied vesicle cosedimentation, coflotation, and fluorometric assays with vesicles based on more physiological lipid compositions to study the mechanism by which twinfilin interacts with lipids. Cosedimentation assays performed with vesicles containing 5% phosphoinositides (PI(3)P, PI(4)P, PI(3,4)P2, PI(3,5)P2, PI(4,5)P2, or PI(3,4,5)P3) mixed with other abundant lipid species found at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (see “Experimental procedures”) revealed that twinfilin has highest affinity toward vesicles containing PI(3,5)P2, PI(4,5)P2, and PI(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1). Twinfilin therefore displays the strongest binding to lipids with a high net negative charge and may additionally prefer PIPs having a phosphate group in the C-5 position of the inositol ring. We also tested whether the twinfilin-lipid interaction is sensitive to phosphoinositide density by carrying out a vesicle cosedimentation assay with vesicles of different PI(4,5)P2 densities (0–20%). These experiments revealed a relatively linear correlation between the amount of cosedimenting twinfilin and the PI(4,5)P2 density of the vesicles (Fig. 1B). Thus, compared with the sharp phosphoinositide-density thresholds reported for N-WASP and cofilin binding to membranes (19Zhao H. Hakala M. Lappalainen P. ADF/cofilin binds phosphoinositides in a multivalent manner to act as a PIP2-density sensor.Biophys.

To examine whether twinfilin interacts with membranes via electrostatic interactions, we performed vesicle cosedimentation assays at different sodium chloride concentrations (0, 100, 250, and 500 mm). The results revealed a clear negative correlation between twinfilin-vesicle interactions and an increasing salt concentration, suggesting that twinfilin associates with membranes through electrostatic interactions (Fig. 1C). Next, we utilized a 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) anisotropy assay to examine whether twinfilin inserts into a lipid bilayer. In this assay, the insertion of a protein motif into the bilayer changes rotational diffusion and hence the anisotropy of the hydrophobic DPH probe (41Zhao H. Lappalainen P. A simple guide to biochemical approaches for analyzing protein-lipid interactions.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23 (22848065): 2823-283010.1091/mbc.E11-07-0645Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Whereas the I-BAR domain of missing-in-metastasis (MIM) protein, containing a membrane-inserting amphipathic helix (42Saarikangas J. Zhao H. Pykäläinen A. Laurinmäki P. Mattila P.K. Kinnunen P.K. Butcher S.J. Lappalainen P. Molecular mechanisms of membrane deformation by I-BAR domain proteins.Curr.

Together, these data show that twinfilin interacts with negatively charged phosphoinositides via electrostatic interactions and does not penetrate the hydrophobic acyl chain region of the lipid bilayer. Because PI(4,5)P2 inhibits the actin-binding function of twinfilin (25Vartiainen M.K. Sarkkinen E.M. Matilainen T. Salminen M. Lappalainen P. Mammals have two twinfilin isoforms whose subcellular localizations and tissue distributions are differentially regulated.J. Biol.

Despite their importance in Antarctic ecosystems, very little is known about their reproductive patterns and strategies. In our study, we surveyed the tissue of six different species for reproductive elements, namely, Dendrilla antarctica Topsent, 1905 (order Dendroceratida), Phorbas areolatus (Thiele, 1905), Kirkpatrickia variolosa (Kirkpatrick, 1907), and Isodictya kerguelenensis (Ridley & Dendy, 1886) (order Poecilosclerida), and Hemigellius pilosus (Kirkpatrick, 1907) and Haliclona penicillata (Topsent, 1908) (Haplosclerida). Samples of these six species containing various reproductive elements were collected in Deception Island and were processed for both light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Even though we were not able to monitor the entire reproductive cycle, due to time and meteorological conditions, we report important aspects of the reproduction of these species. This includes oocyte and embryo morphology and cell ultrastructure, follicular structures and nurse cell activity, as well as vitellogenesis. All species were brooding their embryos within their mesohyl. Both oocytes and embryos were registered in the majority of the studied species, and a single sperm cell being carried to an egg for fertilization was observed in H. penicillata. While the reproductive periods of all species coincided temporally, some of them seemed to rely on a single spawning event, this being suggested by the synchronic oogenesis and embryogenesis occurrence of D. antarctica, P. areolatus and I. kerguelenensis. In contrast, K. variolosa had an asynchronous embryo development, which suggests several larval release events. Our results suggest that differences in the reproductive strategies and morphological traits might succeed in the coexistence of these species at the same habitat avoiding the direct competition between them."

We carried out influenza surveillance in selected domestic animals and compared the virus isolates with isolates obtained in humans during the same period.We collected nasal swabs from pigs, dogs and cats; oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs from poultry; and blood samples from all animals between 2010 and 2012. A standardized questionnaire was administered to farmers and traders. Swabs were tested for influenza A by rtRT-PCR, virus isolation and subtyping was done on all positive swabs. All sera were screened for influenza A antibodies by ELISA, and positives were evaluated by hemagglutination inhibition (HI). Full genome sequencing was done on four selected pig virus isolates.Among 3,798 sera tested by ELISA, influenza A seroprevalence was highest in pigs (15.9%; 172/1084), 1.2% (3/258) in ducks, 1.4% (1/72) in cats 0.6% (3/467) in dogs, 0.1% (2/1894) in chicken and 0% in geese and turkeys. HI testing of ELISA-positive pig sera showed that 71.5% had positive titers to A/California/04/2009(H1N1). Among 6,289 swabs tested by rRT-PCR, influenza A prevalence was highest in ducks [1.2%; 5/423] and 0% in cats and turkeys. Eight virus isolates were obtained from pig nasal swabs collected in 2011 and were determined to be A(H1N1)pdm09 on subtyping. On phylogenetic analysis, four hemagglutinin segments from pig isolates clustered together and were closely associated with human influenza viruses that circulated in Kenya in 2011.Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 isolated in pigs was genetically similar to contemporary human pandemic influenza virus isolates. This suggest that the virus was likely transmitted from humans to pigs, became established and circulated in Kenyan pig populations during the study period. Minimal influenza A prevalence was observed in the other animals studied."

https://openalex.org/W2791541243,"Background Viral load (VL) monitoring of HIV-infected patients in decentralized areas is limited due to logistic constraints. Dried Blood Spots (DBS) offer the opportunity to collect samples in remote area which can be easily transferred and tested at a central laboratory. The MOVIDA (Monitoring Of Viral load In Decentralized Area) project evaluated the performance of VL measurements on DBS using the new CE marked optimized Abbott protocol. Methods HIV-1 infected adults from three outpatient clinics in Hanoi (Vietnam) were enrolled into the study between 1 March and 13 April 2017. VL was measured on DBS using the optimized protocol provided by the manufacturer and compared to plasma VL as reference method on the Abbott m2000rt RealTime HIV-1 platform. Sensitivity was defined as the ability for DBS samples to correctly identify VL failure at the threshold of 1000 copies/mL of plasma, while specificity represented the ability to identify patients with a plasma HIV-RNA VL of <1000 copies/mL. Results A total of 203 patients were enrolled in the study, of which 152 (75%) were male. Median age was 38 [inter quartile range: 34–43] years. Of these patients, 37 were untreated, 38 on ART for <6 months and 117 were on ART for ≥6 months. A strong correlation between VL results in plasma and from DBS was observed (ρ = 0.95; p<0.001). Plasma VL was ≥1000 copies/mL in 71 patients. The sensitivity of DBS was 90.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 80.7–95.9) and the specificity was 96.2% (95% CI: 91.4–98.8). Conclusions The new optimized Abbott DBS protocol performed well in this study, meeting the WHO performance criteria for the use of DBS for HIV VL monitoring. Scaling up VL monitoring using DBS can be used to reach the last 90 in the UNAIDS targets of 90-90-90 to help end the AIDS epidemics. However, sensitivity remains the main challenge for manufacturers to prevent maintaining patients in virological failure on inefficient ART."

However, qualitative analyses revealed that, Staphylococcus aureus was present in 16% and 10% of all poultry and pork samples, respectively, though no methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus could be confirmed. Moreover, E. coli was present in 50% and 67% of all pork and poultry samples, respectively, and thereof 33 isolates were confirmed as extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing E. coli. Only 1.2% of the poultry samples were unacceptable due to the presence of Salmonella spp., whereas they were not detected in any pork sample. Campylobacter spp. were not detected in any sample. Though imported pork and poultry meat complies mostly with national market requirements, it might pose a potential risk to public health, especially for a direct or indirect foodborne transmission of imported, uncommon strains of zoonotic bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2786696220,"Partial transection (PT) of the optic nerve is an established experimental model of secondary degeneration in the central nervous system. After a dorsal transection, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) with axons in ventral optic nerve are intact but vulnerable to secondary degeneration, whereas RGCs in dorsal retina with dorsal axons are affected by primary and secondary injuries. Using microarray, we quantified gene expression changes in dorsal and ventral retina at 1 and 7 days post PT, to characterize pathogenic pathways linked to primary and secondary degeneration.In comparison to uninjured retina Cryba1, Cryba2 and Crygs, were significantly downregulated in injured dorsal retina at days 1 and 7. While Ecel1, Timp1, Mt2A and CD74, which are associated with reducing excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and inflammation, were significantly upregulated. Genes associated with oxygen binding pathways, immune responses, cytokine receptor activity and apoptosis were enriched in dorsal retina at day 1 after PT. Oxygen binding and apoptosis remained enriched at day 7, as were pathways involved in extracellular matrix modification. Fewer changes were observed in ventral retina at day 1 after PT, most associated with the regulation of protein homodimerization activity. By day 7, apoptosis, matrix organization and signal transduction pathways were enriched. Discriminant analysis was also performed for specific functional gene groups to compare expression intensities at each time point. Altered expression of selected genes (ATF3, GFAP, Ecel1, TIMP1, Tp53) and proteins (GFAP, ECEL1 and ATF3) were semi-quantitatively assessed by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry respectively.There was an acute and complex primary injury response in dorsal retina indicative of a dynamic interaction between neuroprotective and neurodegenerative events; ventral retina vulnerable to secondary degeneration showed a delayed injury response. Both primary and secondary injury resulted in the upregulation of numerous genes linked to RGC death, but differences in the nature of these changes strongly suggest that death occurred via different molecular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2786900457,"Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiological agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Both KSHV and HIV infections are endemic in Uganda, where KS is among the most common cancers in HIV-infected individuals. Recent studies examined the use of small RNAs as biomarkers of disease, including microRNAs (miRNAs), with viral and tumor-derived miRNAs being detected in exosomes from individuals with KSHV-associated malignancies. In the current study, the host and viral extracellular mature miRNA expression profiles were analyzed in blood of KS-negative individuals in Uganda, comparing those with or without KSHV detectable from the oropharynx. We observed increased levels of cellular oncogenic miRNAs and decreased levels of tumor-suppressor miRNAs in plasma of infected individuals exhibiting oral KSHV shedding. These changes in host oncomiRs were exacerbated in people co-infected with HIV, and partially reversed after 2 years of anti-retroviral therapy. We also detected KSHV miRNAs in plasma of KSHV infected individuals and determined that their expression levels correlated with KSHV plasma viremia. Deep sequencing revealed an expected profile of small cellular RNAs in plasma, with miRNAs constituting the major RNA biotype. In contrast, the composition of small RNAs in exosomes was highly atypical with high levels of YRNA and low levels of miRNAs. Mass spectrometry analysis of the exosomes revealed eleven different peptides derived from the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, and small RNA sequencing confirmed widespread plasmodium co-infections in the Ugandan cohorts. Proteome analysis indicated an exosomal protein profile consistent with erythrocyte and keratinocyte origins for the plasma exosomes. A strong correlation was observed between the abundance of Plasmodium proteins and cellular markers of malaria. As Plasmodium falciparum is an endemic pathogen in Uganda, our study shows that co-infection with other pathogens, such as KSHV, can severely impact the small RNA repertoire, complicating the use of exosome miRNAs as biomarkers of disease."
https://openalex.org/W2788561461,"Biuret deamination is an essential step in cyanuric acid mineralization. In the well-studied atrazine degrading bacterium Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP, the amidase AtzE catalyzes this step. However, Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae 3841 uses an unrelated cysteine hydrolase, BiuH, instead. Herein, structures of BiuH, BiuH with bound inhibitor and variants of BiuH are reported. The substrate is bound in the active site by a hydrogen bonding network that imparts high substrate specificity. The structure of the inactive Cys175Ser BiuH variant with substrate bound in the active site revealed that an active site cysteine (Cys175), aspartic acid (Asp36) and lysine (Lys142) form a catalytic triad, which is consistent with biochemical studies of BiuH variants. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations highlighted the presence of three channels from the active site to the enzyme surface: a persistent tunnel gated by residues Val218 and Gln215 forming a potential substrate channel and two smaller channels formed by Val28 and a mobile loop (including residues Phe41, Tyr47 and Met51) that may serve as channels for co-product (ammonia) or co-substrate (water)."
https://openalex.org/W2792028452,"The six-minute walk test (6MWT) is considered to be a simple and inexpensive tool for the assessment of functional tolerance of submaximal effort. The aim of this work was 1) to background the nonlinear nature of the energy expenditure process due to physical activity, 2) to compare the results/scores of the submaximal treadmill exercise test and those of 6MWT in pulmonary patients and 3) to develop nonlinear mathematical models relating the two.The study group included patients with the COPD. All patients were subjected to a submaximal exercise test and a 6MWT. To develop an optimal mathematical solution and compare the results of the exercise test and the 6MWT, the least squares and genetic algorithms were employed to estimate parameters of polynomial expansion and piecewise linear models.Mathematical analysis enabled to construct nonlinear models for estimating the MET result of submaximal exercise test based on average walk velocity (or distance) in the 6MWT.Submaximal effort tolerance in COPD patients can be effectively estimated from new, rehabilitation-oriented, nonlinear models based on the generalized MET concept and the 6MWT."
https://openalex.org/W2786570701,"Many countries using sensitive screening methods for detection of carriage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have a sustained low incidence of MRSA infections. For diagnostic laboratories with high sample volumes, MRSA screening requires stability, low maintenance and high performance at a low cost. Herein we designed oligonucleotides for a new nuc targeted hydrolysis probe PCR to replace the standard in-house nuc SybrGreen PCR assay. This new, more time-efficient, PCR assay resulted in a 40% increase in daily sample capacity, with maintained high specificity and sensitivity. The assay was also able to detect Staphylococcus aureus clonal cluster 75 (CC75) lineage strains, recently re-classified as Staphylococcus argenteus, with a sensitivity considerably increased compared to our previous assay. While awaiting consensus if the CC75 lineage of S. aureus should be considered as S. argenteus, and whether methicillin-resistant S. argenteus should be included in the MRSA definition, many diagnostic laboratories need to update their MRSA assay sensitivity/specificity towards this lineage/species. The MRSA screening assay presented in this manuscript is comprised of nuc oligonucleotides separately targeting S. aureus and CC75 lineage strains/S. argenteus, thus providing high user flexibility for the detection of CC75 lineage strains/S. argenteus."
https://openalex.org/W2785379830,"This study uses biomarker information from the 2013 National Nutrition Survey Afghanistan and satellite precipitation driven modeling results from the Global Flood Monitoring System to analyze how floods affect the probability of anemia in Afghan women of reproductive age (15-49). In addition to establishing a causal relation between the two by exploiting the quasi-random variation of floods in different districts and periods, the analysis demonstrates that floods have a significant positive effect on the probability of anemia through two possible transmission mechanisms. The first is a significant effect on inflammation, probably related to water borne diseases carried by unsafe drinking water, and the second is a significant negative effect on retinol concentrations. Because the effect of floods on anemia remains significant even after we control for anemia's most common causes, we argue that the condition may also be affected by elevated levels of psychological stress."
https://openalex.org/W2786460544,"Dipeptidyl peptidase III (DPP III) isolated from the thermophilic bacteria Caldithrix abyssi (Ca) is a two-domain zinc exopeptidase, a member of the M49 family. Like other DPPs III, it cleaves dipeptides from the N-terminus of its substrates but differently from human, yeast and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (mesophile) orthologs, it has the pentapeptide zinc binding motif (HEISH) in the active site instead of the hexapeptide (HEXXGH). The aim of our study was to investigate structure, dynamics and activity of CaDPP III, as well as to find possible differences with already characterized DPPs III from mesophiles, especially B. thetaiotaomicron. The enzyme structure was determined by X-ray diffraction, while stability and flexibility were investigated using MD simulations. Using molecular modeling approach we determined the way of ligands binding into the enzyme active site and identified the possible reasons for the decreased substrate specificity compared to other DPPs III. The obtained results gave us possible explanation for higher stability, as well as higher temperature optimum of CaDPP III. The structural features explaining its altered substrate specificity are also given. The possible structural and catalytic significance of the HEISH motive, unique to CaDPP III, was studied computationally, comparing the results of long MD simulations of the wild type enzyme with those obtained for the HEISGH mutant. This study presents the first structural and biochemical characterization of DPP III from a thermophile."
https://openalex.org/W2792161756,"The rise of bilingual education triggers an important question: which language is preferred for a particular school activity? Our field experiment (n = 120) shows that students (aged 13-15) who process feedback in non-native English have greater self-serving bias than students who process feedback in their native Dutch. By contrast, literature on the foreign-language emotionality effect suggests a weaker self-serving bias in the non-native language, so our result adds nuance to that literature. The result is important to schools as it suggests that teachers may be able to reduce students' defensiveness and demotivation by communicating negative feedback in the native language, and teachers may be able to increase students' confidence and motivation by communicating positive feedback in the foreign language."
https://openalex.org/W2793710739,"Hyperlipidemia is a risk factor of arteriosclerosis, stroke, and other coronary heart disease, which has been shown to correlate with single nucleotide polymorphisms of genes essential for lipid metabolism, such as lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5). In this study, the effect of magnolol, the main active component extracted from Magnolia officinalis, on LPL activity was investigated. A dose-dependent up-regulation of LPL activity, possibly through increasing LPL mRNA transcription, was observed in mouse 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes cultured in the presence of magnolol for 6 days. Subsequently, a transgenic knock-in mice carrying APOA5 c.553G>T variant was established and then fed with corn oil with or without magnolol for four days. The baseline plasma triglyceride levels in transgenic knock-in mice were higher than those in wild-type mice, with the highest increase occurred in homozygous transgenic mice (106 mg/dL vs 51 mg/dL, p<0.01). After the induction of hyperglyceridemia along with the administration of magnolol, the plasma triglyceride level in heterozygous transgenic mice was significantly reduced by half. In summary, magnolol could effectively lower the plasma triglyceride levels in APOA5 c.553G>T variant carrier mice and facilitate the triglyceride metabolism in postprandial hypertriglyceridemia."
https://openalex.org/W2787108457,"The epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) is a member of the ENaC/degenerin family of ion channels. In the structure of a related family member, the domain's base interacts with the pore, and its tip interacts with the divergent domain. Between the base and tip, the thumb domain is characterized by a conserved five-rung disulfide ladder holding together two anti-parallel α helices. The ENaC α and γ subunits' finger domains harbor autoinhibitory tracts that can be proteolytically liberated to activate the channel and also host an ENaC-specific pair of cysteines. Using a crosslinking approach, we show that one of the finger domain cysteines in the α subunit (αCys-263) and both of the finger domain cysteines in the γ subunit (γCys-213 and γCys-220) lie near the dynamic finger-thumb domain interface. Our data suggest that the αCys-256/αCys-263 pair is not disulfide-bonded. In contrast, we found that the γCys-213/γCys-220 pair is disulfide-bonded. Our data also suggest that the γ subunit lacks the terminal rung in the thumb domain disulfide ladder, suggesting asymmetry between the subunits. We also observed functional asymmetry between the α and γ subunit finger-thumb domain interfaces; crosslinks bridging the α subunit finger-thumb interface only inhibited ENaC currents, whereas crosslinks bridging the γ subunit finger-thumb interface activated or inhibited currents dependent on the length of the crosslinker. Our data suggest that reactive cysteines lie at the dynamic finger-thumb interfaces of the α and γ subunits and may play a yet undefined role in channel regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2791331036,"A country’s total fertility rate (TFR) depends on many factors. Attributing changes in TFR to changes of policy is difficult, as they could easily be correlated with changes in the unmeasured drivers of TFR. A case in point is Australia where both pronatalist effort and TFR increased in lock step from 2001 to 2008 and then decreased. The global financial crisis or other unobserved confounders might explain both the reducing TFR and pronatalist incentives after 2008. Therefore, it is difficult to estimate causal effects of policy using econometric techniques. The aim of this study is to instead look at the structure of the population to identify which subgroups most influence TFR. Specifically, we build a stochastic model relating TFR to the fertility rates of various subgroups and calculate elasticity of TFR with respect to each rate. For each subgroup, the ratio of its elasticity to its group size is used to evaluate the subgroup’s potential cost effectiveness as a pronatalist target. In addition, we measure the historical stability of group fertility rates, which measures propensity to change. Groups with a high effectiveness ratio and also high propensity to change are natural policy targets. We applied this new method to Australian data on fertility rates broken down by parity, age and marital status. The results show that targeting parity 3+ is more cost-effective than lower parities. This study contributes to the literature on pronatalist policies by investigating the targeting of policies, and generates important implications for formulating cost-effective policies."
https://openalex.org/W2789701588,"Here, we provide direct evidence that using recombinant proteins expressed in eukaryotic cells as antigen is a practical way to generate monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against heavily glycosylated proteins. Heavily glycosylated proteins are typically difficult targets for mAb generation, being limited by unsatisfactory affinity and low specificity. Using the heavily glycosylated CD45 protein as an example, we demonstrate the entire process of expressing the protein in eukaryotic cells and using it as an antigen to generate CD45-targeting mAbs in mice. The mAbs generated showed robust affinity and specificity, which are crucial factors for differentiate circulating tumor cells from white blood cells in human breast cancer patient samples. Only 1 cell fusion and 2 cyclic sub-cloning steps were necessary before mAbs with satisfactory performance were obtained."
https://openalex.org/W2790156113,"Anxiety disorders (ADs), the most common comorbid illnesses with bipolar disorder (BP) has been reported to associate with dopamine system. Dopamine, metabolized to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) by aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), and the distribution of the ALDH2*1/*1, and ALDH2*1/*2+ALDH*2/*2 alleles in the Han Chinese general population is relatively equal. The association between dopamine metabolic enzymes and cognitive performance in patients with bipolar II disorder (BP-II) comorbid with AD is unclear. This study proposed to explore the role of ALDH2 polymorphisms on neuropsychological performance between BP-II comorbid with or without AD. One hundred ninety-seven BP-II patients with and without a comorbid AD were recruited and compared with 130 healthy controls (HCs). A polymerase chain reaction and a restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis were used to determine genotypes for ALDH2, and study participants underwent neuropsychological tests. An interaction between AD comorbidity and the ALDH2 polymorphisms was found in different domain of cognitive dysfunction in the BP-II patients. The ALDH2 polymorphisms might have different effects on the neuropsychological performance of BP-II patients with and without comorbid AD."
https://openalex.org/W2793276493,"The murine Friend virus (FV) retrovirus model has been widely used to study anti-viral immune responses, and virus-induced cancer. Here we analyzed FV immune evasion mechanisms on the level of dendritic cells (DC) essential for the induction of primary adaptive immune responses. Comparative quantitative proteome analysis of FV-infected DC (FV-DC) of different genotypes (BALB/c, C57BL/6) and non-infected DC revealed numerous genotype-independently regulated proteins rergulating metabolic activity, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and antigen processing/presentation. These alterations may promote virion production in FV-DC. Stimulation of FV-DC with LPS resulted in strongly enhanced IL-10 production which was partially responsible for their attenuated T cell (CD4+, CD8+) stimulatory capacity. Stimulated FV-DC induced less IFN-γ production in T cells required for cellular anti-viral responses, but more T helper cell type 2 (Th2)-associated cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13). We conclude that FV reprograms DC to promote viral spreading and immune deviation by imprinting a largely maturation-resistant, Th2-biased immunophenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2790769099,"Highly Active Antiretroviral therapy (HAART) promotes anthropometric changes in lipid metabolism and glucose in patients with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Functional foods play an important role on metabolism. Bioactive Food Compound (BFC) has shown effective results in changes arising from decompensated lipid metabolism due to the effects of HAART on HIV patients. From this perspective, the objective of this study is to evaluate anthropometric indicators and the body composition of patients undergoing HAART before and after consumption of BFC.This is a prospective intervention with 180 individuals with HIV undergoing HAART. They formed two groups and were monitored for 3 months: the first group consisted of individuals who consumed BFC (n = 121) at the recommended daily intake of 40 g. The second group consisted of individuals who did not consume BFC (n = 59). We determined body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-hip ratio (WHR), conicity index (CI) and antiretroviral regimen used by the patients.The BMI among adults (p<0.001), the WC (p<0.001 and p<0.014 for men and women, respectively) and the CI (p = 0.001 and p<0.001 for men and women, respectively) increased at the end of the study in the group of individuals who did not consume BFC and remained stable in the BFC group. There were no changes in WHR in any of the groups evaluated. Regarding the antiretroviral regimens used, we observed that there was no difference between regimens as for BMI, WC, WHR and CI.The BFC consumed by HIV patients undergoing HAART allowed the maintenance of anthropometric measures without increasing the mean values of conicity index, suggesting that the consumption of this bioactive compound protects the individual against the development of metabolic syndrome (MeS) in patients infected with HIV undergoing antiretroviral therapy."
