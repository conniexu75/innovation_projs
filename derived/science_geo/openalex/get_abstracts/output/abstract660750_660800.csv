https://openalex.org/W3090567217,"From January 2020, COVID-19 is spreading around the world producing serious respiratory symptoms in infected patients that in some cases can be complicated by the severe acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis and septic shock, multiorgan failure, including acute kidney injury and cardiac injury. Cost and time efficient approaches to reduce the burthen of the disease are needed. To find potential COVID-19 treatments among the whole arsenal of existing drugs, we combined system biology and artificial intelligence-based approaches. The drug combination of pirfenidone and melatonin has been identified as a candidate treatment that may contribute to reduce the virus infection. Starting from different drug targets the effect of the drugs converges on human proteins with a known role in SARS-CoV-2 infection cycle. Simultaneously, GUILDify v2.0 web server has been used as an alternative method to corroborate the effect of pirfenidone and melatonin against the infection of SARS-CoV-2. We have also predicted a potential therapeutic effect of the drug combination over the respiratory associated pathology, thus tackling at the same time two important issues in COVID-19. These evidences, together with the fact that from a medical point of view both drugs are considered safe and can be combined with the current standard of care treatments for COVID-19 makes this combination very attractive for treating patients at stage II, non-severe symptomatic patients with the presence of virus and those patients who are at risk of developing severe pulmonary complications."
https://openalex.org/W3089734131,"Genomes of tens of thousands of SARS-CoV2 isolates have been sequenced across the world and the total number of changes (predominantly single base substitutions) in these isolates exceeds ten thousand. We compared the mutational spectrum in the new SARS-CoV-2 mutation dataset with the previously published mutation spectrum in hypermutated genomes of rubella—another positive single stranded (ss) RNA virus. Each of the rubella virus isolates arose by accumulation of hundreds of mutations during propagation in a single subject, while SARS-CoV-2 mutation spectrum represents a collection events in multiple virus isolates from individuals across the world. We found a clear similarity between the spectra of single base substitutions in rubella and in SARS-CoV-2, with C to U as well as A to G and U to C being the most prominent in plus strand genomic RNA of each virus. Of those, U to C changes universally showed preference for loops versus stems in predicted RNA secondary structure. Similarly, to what was previously reported for rubella virus, C to U changes showed enrichment in the uCn motif, which suggested a subclass of APOBEC cytidine deaminase being a source of these substitutions. We also found enrichment of several other trinucleotide-centered mutation motifs only in SARS-CoV-2—likely indicative of a mutation process characteristic to this virus. Altogether, the results of this analysis suggest that the mutation mechanisms that lead to hypermutation of the rubella vaccine virus in a rare pathological condition may also operate in the background of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses currently propagating in the human population."
https://openalex.org/W3091190124,"Background Syndromic surveillance through web or phone-based polling has been used to track the course of infectious diseases worldwide. Our study objective was to describe the characteristics, symptoms, and self-reported testing rates of respondents in three different COVID-19 symptom surveys in Canada. Methods This was a cross-sectional study using three distinct Canada-wide web-based surveys, and phone polling in Ontario. All three sources contained self-reported information on COVID-19 symptoms and testing. In addition to describing respondent characteristics, we examined symptom frequency and the testing rate among the symptomatic, as well as rates of symptoms and testing across respondent groups. Results We found that over March- April 2020, 1.6% of respondents experienced a symptom on the day of their survey, 15% of Ontario households had a symptom in the previous week, and 44% of Canada-wide respondents had a symptom in the previous month. Across the three surveys, SARS-CoV-2-testing was reported in 2–9% of symptomatic responses. Women, younger and middle-aged adults (versus older adults) and Indigenous/First nations/Inuit/Métis were more likely to report at least one symptom, and visible minorities were more likely to report the combination of fever with cough or shortness of breath. Interpretation The low rate of testing among those reporting symptoms suggests significant opportunity to expand testing among community-dwelling residents of Canada. Syndromic surveillance data can supplement public health reports and provide much-needed context to gauge the adequacy of SARS-CoV-2 testing rates."
https://openalex.org/W3089789388,"Depression is a leading cause of disability in the U.S. across all race/ethnicity groups. While non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic persons have worse physical health on most indicators than non-Hispanic White persons, the literature on the association between race/ethnicity and rates of depression is mixed. Given unequal distribution of assets across racial/ethnic groups, it is possible that social and economic differences may explain differential rates of depression across race/ethnicity groups. Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2007-2016, we constructed a nationally representative sample of 26,382 adults over 18 years old (11,072 non-Hispanic White, 5,610 non-Hispanic Black, 6,981 Hispanic, and 2,719 Other race). We measured symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), with a score of 10 or more indicating probable depression. We identified three kinds of assets: financial assets (income), physical assets (home ownership), and social assets (marital status and education). We estimated the weighted prevalence of probable depression across race/ethnicity groups, odds ratios controlling for assets, and predicted probabilities of probable depression across race/ethnicity and asset groups. Three results contribute to our understanding of the differences in probable depression rates between race/ethnicity groups: 1) Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic persons had a higher weighted prevalence of probable depression in the U.S. than non-Hispanic White persons. In models unadjusted for assets, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic persons had 1.3 greater odds of probable depression than non-Hispanic White persons (p<0.01). 2) We found an inverse relation between assets and probable depression across all race-ethnicity groups. Also, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic persons had fewer assets than non-Hispanic Whites. 3) When we controlled for assets, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic persons had 0.8 times lower odds of probable depression than non-Hispanic White persons (p<0.05). Thus, when holding assets constant, minorities had better mental health than non-Hispanic White persons in the U.S. These three findings help to reconcile findings in the literature on race/ethnicity and depression. Given vastly unequal distribution of wealth in the U.S., it is not surprising that racial minorities, who hold fewer assets, would have an overall larger prevalence of mental illness, as seen in unadjusted estimates. Once assets are taken into account, Black and Hispanic persons appear to have better mental health than non-Hispanic White persons. Assets may explain much of the relation between race/ethnicity group and depression in the U.S. Future research should consider the role of assets in protecting against mental illness."
https://openalex.org/W3090631012,"One of the adaptive strategies for the constantly changing conditions of the environment utilized in bacterial cells involves the condensation of DNA in complex with the DNA-binding protein, Dps. With the use of electron microscopy and electron tomography, we observed several morphologically different types of DNA condensation in dormant Escherichia coli cells, namely: nanocrystalline, liquid crystalline, and the folded nucleosome-like. We confirmed the presence of both Dps and DNA in all of the ordered structures using EDX analysis. The comparison of EDX spectra obtained for the three different ordered structures revealed that in nanocrystalline formation the majority of the Dps protein is tightly bound to nucleoid DNA. The dps-null cells contained only one type of condensed DNA structure, liquid crystalline, thus, differing from those with Dps. The results obtained here shed some light on the phenomenon of DNA condensation in dormant prokaryotic cells and on the general problem of developing a response to stress. We demonstrated that the population of dormant cells is structurally heterogeneous, allowing them to respond flexibly to environmental changes. It increases the ability of the whole bacterial population to survive under extreme stress conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3091419203,"Sub-Saharan Africa has been heavily impacted by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Social data (e.g., social media, internet search, wearable device, etc) show great promise assisting in public health and HIV surveillance. However, research on this topic has primarily focused in higher resource settings, such as the United States. It is especially important to study the prevalence and potential use of these data sources and tools in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), such as Sub-Saharan Africa, which have been heavily impacted by the HIV epidemic, to determine the feasibility of using these technologies as surveillance and intervention tools. Accordingly, we 1) described the prevalence and characteristics of various social technologies within South Africa, 2) using Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube as a case study, analyzed the prevalence and patterns of social media use related to HIV risk in South Africa, and 3) mapped and statistically tested differences in HIV-related social media posts within regions of South Africa. Geocoded data were collected over a three-week period in 2018 (654,373 tweets, 90,410 Instagram posts and 14,133 YouTube videos with 1,121 comments). Of all tweets, 4,524 (0.7%) were found to related to HIV and AIDS. The percentage was similar for Instagram 95 (0.7%) but significantly lower for YouTube 18 (0.1%). We found regional differences in prevalence and use of social media related to HIV. We discuss the implication of data from these technologies in surveillance and interventions within South Africa and other LMICs."
https://openalex.org/W3000737083,"Empirical research on migration has historically been fraught with measurement challenges. Recently, the increasing ubiquity of digital trace data—from mobile phones, social media, and related sources of ‘big data’—has created new opportunities for the quantitative analysis of migration. However, most existing work relies on relatively ad hoc methods for inferring migration. Here, we develop and validate a novel and general approach to detecting migration events in trace data. We benchmark this method using two different trace datasets: four years of mobile phone metadata from a single country’s monopoly operator, and three years of geo-tagged Twitter data. The novel measures more accurately reflect human understanding and evaluation of migration events, and further provide more granular insight into migration spells and types than what are captured in standard survey instruments."
https://openalex.org/W3089682508,"Objective The objective of this study was to define the threatened perception types of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic and determine the correlations between the perception types and their demographic factors, their preventive knowledge of COVID-19 and their mental status in order to provide suggestions for pregnant women during pandemic. Methods Latent class analysis were used to explore the optimal numbers of clusters. Multinomial logistic regression and multiple correspondence analysis were used to analyze the demographic variables of the latent categories. MANOVA was used to analyze the difference of knowledge of COVID-19 obtained among clusters and their psychological status, and chi-square test was used determine the relationship between the latent clusters and the participant’s COVID-19 worry level. Results Five clusters were found: the first cluster (n = 120, 39%) was unthreatened and confident. Cluster 2(n = 84, 28%) was unthreatened but not confident. Cluster 3 (n = 49, 17%) was threatened but confident. Cluster 4 (n = 25, 9%) was threaten, not confident and knowledgeable, and Cluster 5 (n = 20, 7%) was threatened, not confident and lacking knowledge. Three demographic variables were shown an effect on the classification, they were support from work, family support and intrapartum and postpartum complications. Conclusion This study can help assess the mental health risks of pregnant women during an epidemic. The results could be helpful for families, work units, communities and medical institutions to make targeted intervention decisions for pregnant women."
https://openalex.org/W3091172448,"The purpose of this study was to compare the duration of high-intensity static stretching on flexibility and strength in the hamstrings.Fourteen healthy males (20.8 ± 0.6 years, 170.7 ± 6.5 cm, 66.4 ± 9.9 kg) underwent high-intensity static stretching for three different durations (10, 15, and 20 seconds). The intensity of static stretching was set at the maximum point of discomfort. To examine the change in flexibility and strength, range of motion, peak passive torque, relative passive torque, muscle-tendon unit stiffness, peak torque of isokinetic knee flexion, and knee angle at peak torque of isokinetic knee flexion were measured. To evaluate a time course of pain, a numerical rating scale was described.Range of motion (P < 0.01), peak passive torque (P < 0.01), and knee angle at peak torque were increased at all interventions. Relative passive torque (P < 0.01) and muscle-tendon unit stiffness (P < 0.01) were decreased at all interventions. Peak torque decreased after 10 seconds of stretching (P < 0.05). Numerical rating scale during stretching was 8-9 levels in all interventions, the pain disappeared immediately after the post-measurements (median = 0).The results suggested that muscle-tendon unit stiffness decreased regardless of duration of high-intensity static stretching. However, peak torque of isokinetic knee flexion decreased after 10 seconds of high-intensity static stretching, though it was no change after for more than 15 seconds of stretching."
https://openalex.org/W3090068939,"Infection with parasitic copepod salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis, represents one of the most important limitations to sustainable Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) farming today in the North Atlantic region. The parasite exerts negative impact on health, growth and welfare of farmed fish as well as impact on wild salmonid populations. It is therefore central to ensure continuous low level of salmon lice with the least possible handling of the salmon and drug use. To address this, vaccination is a cost-effective and environmentally friendly control approach. In this study, efficacy of a vaccine candidate, containing a peptide derived from ribosomal protein P0, was validated post infestation with L. salmonis, at the lab-scale. The sampling results showed good potential of the vaccine candidate when administered intraperitoneally in the host, in reducing the ectoparasite load, through reduction of adult female lice counts and fecundity and with greater presumptive effect in F1 lice generation. The sampling results correlated well with the differential modulation of pro-inflammatory, Th1, Th2 and T regulatory mediators at the transcript level at different lice stages. Overall, the results supports approximately 56% efficacy when administered by intraperitoneal injection. However, additional validation is necessary under large-scale laboratory trial for further application under field conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3091613527,"Examine if adding aerobic exercise to standard medical care (EX+SC) prior to bariatric surgery improves metabolic health in relation to surgical outcomes.Fourteen bariatric patients (age: 42.3±2.5y, BMI: 45.1±2.5 kg/m2) met inclusion criteria and were match-paired to pre-operative SC (n = 7) or EX+SC (n = 7; walking 30min/d, 5d/wk, 65-85% HRpeak) for 30d. A 120min mixed meal tolerance test was performed pre- and post-intervention (~2d prior to surgery) to assess insulin sensitivity (Matsuda Index) and metabolic flexibility (indirect calorimetry). Aerobic fitness (VO2peak), body composition (BodPod), and adipokines (adiponectin, leptin) were also measured. Omental adipose tissue was collected during surgery to quantify gene expression of adiponectin and leptin, and operating time and length of hospital stay were recorded. ANOVA and Cohen's d effect size (ES) was used to test group differences.SC tended to increase percent body fat (P = 0.06) after the intervention compared to EX+SC. Although SC and EX+SC tended to raise insulin sensitivity (P = 0.11), EX+SC enhanced metabolic flexibility (P = 0.01, ES = 1.55), reduced total adiponectin (P = 0.01, ES = 1.54) with no change in HMW adiponectin and decreased the length of hospital stay (P = 0.05) compared to SC. Albeit not statistically significant, EX+SC increased VO2peak 2.9% compared to a 5.9% decrease with SC (P = 0.24, ES = 0.91). This increased fitness correlated to shorter operating time (r = -0.57, P = 0.03) and length of stay (r = -0.58, P = 0.03). Less omental total adiponectin (r = 0.52, P = 0.09) and leptin (r = 0.58, P = 0.05) expression correlated with shorter operating time, and low leptin expression was linked to shorter length of stay (r = 0.70, P = 0.01), and low leptin expression was linked to shorter length of stay (r = 0.70, P = 0.01).Adding pre-operative aerobic exercise to standard care may improve surgical outcomes through a fitness and adipose tissue derived mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W3090035870,"Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a validated therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes and obesity. Ertiprotafib is a PTP1B inhibitor that reached the clinical trial stage for the treatment of diabetes. Interestingly, Ertiprotafib reduces the melting temperature of PTP1B in differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) assays, different from most drugs that increase the stability of their target upon binding. No molecular data on how Ertiprotafib functions has been published. Thus, to gain molecular insights into the mode of action of Ertiprotafib, we used biomolecular NMR spectroscopy to characterize the molecular details of the PTP1B:Ertiprotafib interaction. Our results show that Ertiprotafib induces aggregation of PTP1B in a concentration dependent manner. This shows that the insufficient clinical efficacy and adverse effects caused by Ertiprotafib is due to its tendency to cause aggregation of PTP1B."
https://openalex.org/W3091657194,"Urbanisation is increasing worldwide and is regarded a major driver of environmental change altering local species assemblages. Private domestic gardens contribute a significant share of total green area in cities, but their biodiversity has received relatively little attention. Previous studies mainly considered plants, flying invertebrates such as bees and butterflies, and birds. By using a multi-taxa approach focused on less mobile, ground-dwelling invertebrates, we examined the influence of local garden characteristics and landscape characteristics on species richness and abundance of gastropods, spiders, millipedes, woodlice, ants, ground beetles and rove beetles. We assume that most of the species of these groups are able to complete their entire life cycle within a single garden. We conducted field surveys in thirty-five domestic gardens along a rural-urban gradient in Basel, Switzerland. Considered together, the gardens examined harboured an impressive species richness, with a mean share of species of the corresponding groups known for Switzerland of 13.9%, ranging from 4.7% in ground beetles to 23.3% in woodlice. The overall high biodiversity is a result of complementary contributions of gardens harbouring distinct species assemblages. Indeed, at the garden level, species richness of different taxonomical groups were typically not inter-correlated. The exception was ant species richness, which was correlated with those of gastropods and spiders. Generalised linear models revealed that distance to the city centre is an important driver of species richness, abundance and composition of several groups, resulting in an altered species composition in gardens in the centre of the city. Local garden characteristics were important drivers of gastropod and ant species richness, and the abundance of spiders, millipedes and rove beetles. Our study shows that domestic gardens make a valuable contribution to regional biodiversity. Thus, domestic urban gardens constitute an important part of green infrastructure, which should be considered by urban planners."
https://openalex.org/W3090377096,"Kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) is a cost-effective single-step SNP genotyping technology, With an objective to enhance the marker repertoire and develop high efficient KASP-SNP markers in Chinese cabbage, we re-sequenced four Chinese cabbage doubled haploid (DH) lines, Y177-47, Y635-10, Y510-1 and Y510-9, and generated a total of more than 38.5 billion clean base pairs. A total of 827,720 SNP loci were identified with an estimated density of 3,217 SNPs/Mb. Further, a total of 387,354 SNPs with at least 30 bp to the next most adjacent SNPs on either side were selected as resource for KASP markers. From this resource, 258 (96.27%) of 268 SNP loci were successfully transformed into KASP-SNP markers using a Roche LightCycler 480-II instrument. Among these markers, 221 (85.66%) were co-dominant markers, 220 (85.27%) were non-synonymous SNPs, and 257 (99.6%) were newly developed markers. In addition, 53 markers were applied for genotyping of 34 Brassica rapa accessions. Cluster analysis separated these 34 accessions into three clusters based on heading types. The millions of SNP loci, a large set of resource for KASP markers, as well as the newly developed KASP markers in this study may facilitate further genetic and molecular breeding studies in Brassica rapa."
https://openalex.org/W3090423763,"This article investigates acculturation stress among Pakistani students who are studying in Chinese universities, located in five provinces where international students are concentrated, with a mix-method approach. 203 students among 260 questionnaire recipients responded the online survey. When using the ASSIS (Acculturation Stress Scale for International Students) as instrument, the Principal Component Analysis Method and SPSS 20.0, we found that Pakistani students are under acculturative stress, 68.53%, 10.97% and 9.15% of them perceived discrimination, home sickness and perceived hate, and 5.25%, 3.11% and 2.58% of them fear, culture shock and guilt respectively. The qualitative segment of the study is consisted of 20 Pakistani students studying in 4 universities located in Wuhan city of Hubei capital enquiring through semi-structured interviews. The findings illustrate that Pakistani students in China are expressing their major concerns on culture shock, homesickness, food and language barriers while disconfirm ASSIS findings like perceived discrimination, hate, fear and guilt as factors responsible for acculturative stress. The study suggested that pre-departure orientation lectures about host country’s cultural values and campus environment, and on-campus extra-curricular, cultural activities and maximum social interaction with local students can effectively acculturate students in new cultural setting, and can lower their acculturative stress."
https://openalex.org/W3090196836,"The quantitative study of cell morphology is of great importance as the structure and condition of cells and their structures can be related to conditions of health or disease. The first step towards that, is the accurate segmentation of cell structures. In this work, we compare five approaches, one traditional and four deep-learning, for the semantic segmentation of the nuclear envelope of cervical cancer cells commonly known as HeLa cells. Images of a HeLa cancer cell were semantically segmented with one traditional image-processing algorithm and four three deep learning architectures: VGG16, ResNet18, Inception-ResNet-v2, and U-Net. Three hundred slices, each 2000 × 2000 pixels, of a HeLa Cell were acquired with Serial Block Face Scanning Electron Microscopy. The first three deep learning architectures were pre-trained with ImageNet and then fine-tuned with transfer learning. The U-Net architecture was trained from scratch with 36, 000 training images and labels of size 128 × 128. The image-processing algorithm followed a pipeline of several traditional steps like edge detection, dilation and morphological operators. The algorithms were compared by measuring pixel-based segmentation accuracy and Jaccard index against a labelled ground truth. The results indicated a superior performance of the traditional algorithm (Accuracy = 99%, Jaccard = 93%) over the deep learning architectures: VGG16 (93%, 90%), ResNet18 (94%, 88%), Inception-ResNet-v2 (94%, 89%), and U-Net (92%, 56%)."
https://openalex.org/W3090460929,"Plant landscapes are fundamental components of the green space of urban parks and are often dynamic, changing throughout the year. Winter is a season with poor plant landscape effects in urban park green spaces. However, plant community landscapes in the winter in urban park green spaces could be further optimized. Here, we conducted scenic beauty estimation (SBE) of the landscape factors in 29 winter plant communities in four typical urban parks in Yangzhou, China using partial correlation analysis and multiple linear regression. The standard SBE values of the 29 plant communities ranged from -0.981 to 1.209. Complex plant community landscapes with abundant plant species, beautiful plant community morphology and obvious seasonal changes generally received high scenic beauty scores. Six landscape factors, including the diversity of plant species, the proportion of evergreen tree species, the morphological characteristics of plants, the ground cover rate, the overall sense of harmony and the color composition, greatly influenced the scenic beauty of the plant landscape in the winter. Generally, the results of this study provide insight into how the plant community landscape in urban parks could be improved."
https://openalex.org/W3090880297,"Hypertension frequently occurs in subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH). By bolstering thyroid inflammation, anti-peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) causes autoimmune thyroiditis, which is one of the most common causes of SCH. Since the absence of thyroid cysts is associated with TPO-Ab (+) based on the indication of latent thyroid damage, we explored the potential mechanism underlying the association among TPO-Ab, SCH, hypertension, and thyroid cysts. A cross-sectional study of 1,483 Japanese aged 40–74 years was conducted. Thyroid cysts were defined as those having a maximum diameter of ≥ 2.0 mm, containing no solid component. TPO-Ab (+) was positively associated with SCH with hypertension (adjusted odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.62 [1.40, 4.89]) but not with SCH without hypertension (0.84 [0.37, 1.89]), respectively. Moreover, among participants without thyroid cysts, SCH was positively associated with hypertension (2.15 [1.23, 3.76]) but not among participants with thyroid cysts (0.58 [0.16, 2.16]), respectively. TPO-Ab was positively associated with SCH with hypertension, but not with SCH without hypertension. In addition, status of thyroid cysts might act as a determinant factor on the association between SCH and hypertension. These findings are efficient tools to clarify the background mechanism that underlies SCH."

Therefore, we examined 25(OH)D levels as well as red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb), and Hematocrit (Hct) at the three trimesters among pregnant Japanese women to determine the distribution of serum 25(OH)D levels and the influence of hemodilution.This was a longitudinal study.The study was conducted at Ibaraki Seinan Medical Center Hospital in Japan.The participants comprised 50 women in the first trimester with singleton pregnancies and without any complications.Participants were recruited from June to August 2018, and followed up till their postpartum period. Blood samples were collected at the first, second, and third trimesters, i.e., at 4-15, 16-27, and 28-39 weeks, respectively. 25(OH)D levels, RBC, Hb, and Hct were analyzed across the three trimesters.Comparing the first, second, and third trimesters, 25(OH)D, RBC, and Hb were significantly declined in the second and third trimesters (p < 0.001). According to Spearman's correlation coefficient with 25(OH)D and RCB, Hb, Hct, significant correlations were found between 25(OH)D and Hb (p < 0.001), as well as Hct (p < 0.001) in the third trimester.The present study had two major findings. First, it showed that the vitamin D status of most pregnant Japanese women were considered as vitamin D deficient. Second, the maternal serum 25(OH)D levels, RBC, Hb, and Hct of the pregnant women declined in the second and third trimesters. Thus we propose to have routine screening of vitamin D status of pregnant women, especially in the second trimester."
https://openalex.org/W3090250982,"Background Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a burdensome respiratory disorder whose etiology and pathophysiology remain controversial and most likely multifactorial. Accumulated evidence indicates that gut dysbiosis contributes to AR via the gut-airway axis. Constipation could result in alteration of the intestinal microflora. The clinical impact of constipation on AR has not been studied. We aimed to evaluate the risk of AR in constipated patients using a nationwide longitudinal population-based cohort. Methods We identified 57786 patients with constipation and 57786 matched controls between 1999 and 2013 from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database, which is a subset of Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database. Propensity score analysis was used for matching age, sex, comorbidities, and medications at a ratio of 1:1. Multiple Cox regression and subgroup analyses were used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio of AR. Results The incidence of AR was 32.2 per 1,000 person-years in constipated patients, which was twice that of non-constipated patients. After adjustment for patients’ age, gender, comorbidities, and medications, patients with constipation had a 2.3-fold risk of AR compared to those without constipation (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 2.30; 95% CI, 2.23–2.37). In subgroup analyses, patients aged 20–39 years had a 2.24-fold higher risk of AR in the constipation cohort (aHR; 95% CI, 2.12–2.36). Patients aged <20, 40–64, and ≥65 years had a 2.09, 2.05, and 2.07-fold risk of AR in the constipation cohort, respectively (aHR; 95% CI, 1.98–2.20, 1.94–2.18, and 1.92–2.23). Also, patients with constipation had a higher likelihood of AR, regardless of sex, and with or without comorbidities including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, and anxiety. Conclusion Constipation might be associated with an increased risk of incidental AR. It seems that physicians should keep a higher index of suspicion for AR in people with constipation. The patency issue of gut could not be ignored in patients with AR."

https://openalex.org/W3091082820,"The critically endangered Amargosa vole (Microtus californicus scirpensis) is found only in rare marsh habitat near Tecopa, California in a plant community dominated by three-square bulrush (Schoenoplectus americanus). Since the earliest research on the Amargosa vole, the existing paradigm has been that these voles are obligatorily dependent on bulrush as their only food source and for the three-dimensional canopy and litter structure it provides for predator avoidance. However, no prior research has confirmed the diet of the Amargosa vole. In this study we characterized the Amargosa vole’ nutritional needs, analyzed the quality of bulrush by forage analysis, and performed microhistological and metabarcoding analyses of vole feces to determine what foods were consumed in the wild. All bulrush plant tissues analyzed were low in fat (from 0.9% of dry matter in roots to 3.6% in seeds), high in neutral detergent fiber (from 5.9% in rhizomes to 33.6% in seeds), and low in protein (7.3–8.4%). These findings support the conclusion that bulrush alone is unlikely to support vole survival and reproduction. Fecal microhistology and DNA metabarcoding revealed relatively diverse diets including plants in 14 families, with rushes (Juncaceae), bulrushes (Cyperaceae), and grasses (Poaceae) being the most common diet items. On microhistology, all analyzed samples contained bulrush, sedges (Carex sp.), rushes (Juncus sp.), and beaked spikerush (Eleocharis rostrellata) even from marshes where non-bulrush plants were uncommon. There was evidence of insects at <1% in two marshes but none in the remaining marshes. Metabarcoding detected ten genera of plants. When considering non-Schoenoplectus targets, for which metabarcoding had poor sensitivity, saltgrass (Distichlis spicata) was the most commonly detected species, with prominent contributions from seaside arrowgrass (Triglochin concinna) and yerba mansa (Anemopsis californica) as well. Diversity of vole diets generally increased with increasing site plant diversity, but differences were not statistically significant. Confirming details about dietary behaviors is critical for informing appropriate conservation planning including habitat management and reintroduction of voles into new sites."

Recently, scholars have shown a great interest in researching the eminence of CPEC. Despite prodigious efforts of scholars, the question ""how CPEC would influence living standards of rural women and what they perceive?"" has been remained unanswered. The present study is the first attempt to unearth the perceptions of rural areas' women towards CPEC. We collected empirical evidence through a structured questionnaire from 302 educated rural women and interviewing 32 uneducated rural women. The following major conclusions are drawn through structural equation modeling via AMOS 21: the rural women significantly directly perceive new opportunities through CPEC; however, they perceive that the CPEC would not directly influence their quality of life and self-enhancement, but through the development of these rural areas. Rural development partially mediates the relationship between CPEC development and perceived opportunities while it fully mediates the relationships between CPEC development and quality of life as well as between CPEC development and self-enhancement. Policymakers need to emphasize on development of rural areas that would improve living standards of poor communities. The government needs to meet the expectations of poor communities and rural women to ensure their sustainable development."
https://openalex.org/W3089455613,"Peripheral intravenous catheters (PIVCs) are the most widely used invasive devices worldwide. Up to 42% of PIVCs are prematurely removed during intravenous therapy due to failure. To date, there have been few systematic attempts in European hospitals to measure adherence to recommendations to mitigate PIVC failures.To analyse the clinical outcomes from clinical practice guideline recommendations for PIVC care on different hospital types and environments.We conducted an observational study in three hospitals in Spain from December 2017 to April 2018. The adherence to recommendations was monitored via visual inspection in situ evaluations of all PIVCs inserted in adults admitted. Context and clinical characteristics were collected by an evaluation tool, analysing data descriptively.646 PIVCs inserted in 624 patients were monitored, which only 52.7% knew about their PIVC. Regarding PIVC insertion, 3.4% (22/646) patients had at least 2 PIVCs simultaneously. The majority of PIVCs were 20G (319/646; 49.4%) and were secured with transparent polyurethane dressing (605/646; 93.7%). Most PIVCs (357/646; 55.3%) had a free insertion site during the visual inspection at first sight. We identified 342/646 (53%) transparent dressings in optimal conditions (clean, dry, and intact dressing). PIVC dressings in medical wards were much more likely to be in intact conditions than those in surgical wards (234/399, 58.7% vs. 108/247, 43.7%). We identified 55/646 (8.5%) PIVCs without infusion in the last 24 hours and 58/646 (9.0%) PIVCs without infusion for more than 24 hours. Regarding PIVC failure, 74 (11.5%) adverse events were identified, all of them reflecting clinical manifestation of phlebitis.Our findings indicate that the clinical outcome indicators from CPG for PIVC care were moderate, highlighting differences between hospital environments and types. Also, we observed that nearly 50% of patients did not know what a PIVC is."
https://openalex.org/W3090871396,"Anthropogenic environments provide favorable conditions for some species, which is especially true of mosquitoes that present eclecticism at the moment of choice for the site of oviposition. In the present study, the diversity of mosquitoes was assessed by providing plastic containers, bamboo internodes, and tires in a forest, the forest edge, and peridomicile environments in a rural settlement area. Eighteen sampling points were chosen, delimited by a buffer of 200 m, placed in three environments: forest, forest edge, and peridomicile. In each environment, larvitraps were installed, separated by a minimum distance of 7 m and 1 m from the ground. A total of 10,131 immature mosquitoes of 20 species were collected. The most abundant species was Culex urichii (29.5%), followed by Trichoprosopon digitatum (27.1%), and Cx. (Melanoconion) spp. (10.4%). There was a difference in the composition of immature mosquito populations between larvitraps (p < 0.0005), and the plastic container hosted a greater diversity of species, whereas tires presented a greater abundance of individuals. The forest, forest edge, and peridomicile environments were also different with regard to diversity of immature mosquito populations (p < 0.0010). The forest edge was the environment with the greatest diversity of species, followed by the peridomicile and forest environments. In the forest and peridomicile, plastic container larvitraps had the greatest diversity, whereas the forest edge tire presented the largest number of individuals. Further, tire larvitraps collected the largest number of individuals in all environments. Ten species associated with the bamboo internode and tire were identified. The preference of species for artificial larvitraps, such as the plastic container and tire, even in wild environments was noted. These artificial objects may represent a risk factor for the population living in this region, as all vector species found in the study were present in plastic containers and tires."
https://openalex.org/W3091269819,"Patients with acute severe asthma (ASA) may in rare cases require invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). However, recent data on this issue are lacking.In this retrospective and bicentric study conducted on a 10 year period, we investigate the in-hospital mortality in patients with ASA requiring IMV. We compare this mortality to that of patients with other types of respiratory distress using a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) model.Eighty-one episodes of ASA requiring IMV were evaluated. Factors significantly associated with in-hospital mortality were cardiac arrest on day of admission, cardiac arrest as the reason for intubation, absence of decompensation risk factors, need for renal replacement therapy on day of admission, and intubation in pre-hospital setting. Non-survivors had higher SAPS II, SOFA, creatinine and lactate levels as well as lower blood pressure, pH, and HCO3 on day of admission. In-hospital mortality was 15% (n = 12). Compared to a reference population of 2,670 patients, the SMR relative to the SAPS II was very low at 0.48 (95% CI, 0.25-0.84). The only factor independently associated with in-hospital mortality was cardiac arrest on day of admission. In-hospital mortality was 69% in patients with cardiac arrest on day of admission and 4% in others (p < 0.01). Salvage therapies were given to 7 patients, sometimes in combination with each other: ECMO (n = 6), halogenated gas (n = 1) and anti-IL5 antibody (n = 1). Death occurred in only 2 of these 7 patients, both of whom had cardiac arrest on day of admission.Nowadays, the mortality of patients with ASA requiring IMV is low. Death is due to multi-organ failure, with cardiac arrest on day of admission being the most important risk factor. In patients who did not have cardiac arrest on day of admission the mortality is even lower (4%) which allows an aggressive management."
https://openalex.org/W3090295819,"The primary aim of the present study was to analyze mechanical responses during inertial knee- and hip-dominant hamstring strengthening exercises (flywheel leg-curl and hip-extension in conic-pulley), and the secondary aim was to measure and compare regional muscle use using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Mean power, peak power, mean velocity, peak velocity and time in the concentric (CON) and eccentric (ECC) phases were measured. The transverse relaxation time (T2) shift from pre- to post-exercise were calculated for the biceps femoris long (BFl) and short (BFs) heads, semitendinosus (ST) and semimembranosus (SM) muscles at proximal, middle and distal areas of the muscle length. Peak and mean power in flywheel leg-curl were higher during the CON than the ECC phase (p<0.01). ECC peak power was higher than CON phase (p<0.01) in conic-pulley hip-extension exercise, while mean power was higher during the CON than ECC phase (p<0.01). Flywheel leg-curl showed a higher T2 values in ST and BFs and BFl (p<0.05), while the conic-pulley hip-extension had a higher T2 values in the proximal region of the ST and BFl (p<0.05). In conclusion, ECC overload was only observed in peak power during the conic-pulley hip-extension exercise. Flywheel leg-curl involved a greater overall use of the 4 muscle bellies, more specifically in the ST and BFs, with a selective augmented activity (compared with the conic-pulley) in the 3 regions of the BFs, while conic-pulley hip-extension exercise selectively targeted the proximal and medial regions of the BFl. Physiotherapists and strength and conditioning coaches should consider this when optimizing the training and recovery process for hamstring muscles, especially after injury."
https://openalex.org/W3089410649,"Resource-deprived coastal peri-urban settlements in Southern Ghana are characterized by indiscriminate solid waste disposal and open defecation practices. Persons engaged in waste handling in such communities perform their activities with little or no personal protective equipment. They are thus confronted with the risk of faecal pollution of the hands and other bodily parts. A mixed method approach was used to investigate 280 waste handlers performing different activities to estimate recent faecal pollution of their hands and to observe the utilization of personal protective equipment and sanitation/hygiene facilities during work. The log concentration of E. coli on hands of waste handlers after work (8.60 ± 4.20 CFU/hand, mean ± standard deviation) was significantly higher compared with the E. coli log concentration before work (2.95 ± 1.89 CFU/hand, mean ± standard deviation) (p<0.001). The odds of faecal pollution was significantly higher (aOR 4.2; 95% CI: 1.9–9.1) for workers aged 35 years and above compared with those less than 35 years; and for workers at public toilet facilities (aOR 3.0; 95% CI: 1.0–8.4) compared with those who worked for private waste handling companies. Female workers were, however, 60% less likely (aOR 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2–0.8) to experience faecal pollution of their hands compared with males. The workers had limited access to water and sanitation and hygiene facilities, and about one-fifth (n = 59; 21.1%) did not use personal protective equipment during work. Waste handlers should be provided and instructed in proper use of personal protective equipment, have access to sanitation facilities and adopt improved hygiene behaviour to avoid the risk of faecal pollution and associated disease risk."
https://openalex.org/W3090330301,"Our intuitive understanding of adaptation by natural selection is dominated by the power of selection at early ages in large populations. Yet, as the forces of natural selection fall with adult age, we expect adaptation to be attenuated with age. Explicit simulations of age-dependent adaptation suggest that populations adapt to a novel environment quickly at early ages, but only slowly and incompletely at later adult ages. Experimental tests for age-dependent adaptation to a novel diet were performed on populations of Drosophila melanogaster. The results support the prediction that populations should perform better on an ancestral, long-abandoned diet, compared to an evolutionarily recent diet, only at later ages. D. melanogaster populations also perform poorly on a novel diet compared to an evolutionarily recent diet that has been sustained for hundreds of generations, particularly at earlier ages. Additional experiments demonstrate that the timing of the shift to better performance in our populations on the long-abandoned diet is dependent on when the forces of natural selection weaken in the evolutionary history of experimental populations. Taken together, these experimental findings suggest that the forces of natural selection scale the rate of adaptation to novel environments."
https://openalex.org/W3090384431,"It is widely accepted that canine breeds stand and move differently. The prevalence of various musculoskeletal disorders such as hip and elbow dysplasia is also different between breeds. German shepherd dog (GSD) and Labrador retriever dog (LRD) are two large breeds with different conformations that have high prevalence of these disorders. This study quantifies the movement and standing posture of twelve healthy GSDs and twelve healthy LRDs to identify biomechanical similarities and differences that may be linked to sub-optimal hip and elbow mechanics. A pressure walkway and a motion capture system obtained measures of kinetics, kinematics and conformation during standing and trot. During standing, LRDs carry a greater percentage of the weight on the forelimbs (69%±5% vs. GSDs: 62%±2%, p<0.001) and their body Centre of Pressure (CoP) is located more cranially (p<0.001). GSDs had a greater pelvic tilt (79°±8 vs. 66°±9°, p = 0.004), more flexed stifles (44°±9° vs. LRDs: 34°±10°, p<0.05) and hocks (58°±11° vs. 26°±9°, p<0.01) and more extended hips (-10°±11° vs. 30°±12°, p<0.001). During trot, the GSDs’ CoP had a longer anterior-posterior trajectory (151%±22% vs. LRDs: 93%±25% of the withers height, p<0.001). Stride parameters and loading of limbs were similar when normalised to the size and weight of the dog, respectively. The LRDs had a more extended thoracolumbar angle (p<0.001) and a less flexed lumbosacral angle (p<0.05). The LRDs’ hip remained flexed during trot whereas the GSDs’ hip joint was less flexed during swing (p<0.001) and more extended in late stance and early swing (p<0.001). In conclusion, the LRDs and GSDs differ in the way they stand and move and this would result in different loading pattern of the joints. Further investigation is required to determine the extent to which biomechanical differences are linked to musculoskeletal problems presented clinically."

This fungus has spread globally and has caused mortalities in nearly every continent. In South America, Suriname, Guyana and Paraguay are among the remaining three countries where Bd has not been detected to date. To complete the assessment of the possible presence of Bd in Suriname, 205 specimens from the Zoological Collection of Suriname, compromising 6 frog families and 15 genera were sampled for chytrid fungus. No specimens were found to be infected by this fungus and as such the outcome strengthens the previous result of field sampling that there is no support that Bd has spread to Suriname."
https://openalex.org/W3089994006,"All results in this paper are based upon a new dataset consisting in 60 Swadesh lists of 207 items, overall 12,420 terms collected during 2018-2019. Each list corresponds to a different variety of Malagasy, which is not simply identified by the name of the ethnicity but also by the precise location where the variety was collected. This is very important since some traditional ethnic groups are a heritage of historical events rather than representing communities with similar habits and dialects. This new dataset is by far the best available, both for dimension and completeness. The varieties are classified both by standard tools, as the trees generated by UPGMA and NJ which privilege genealogy by detecting vertical transmissions, and by a new method which privileges horizontal exchanges. The new method results in a two-dimensional chart of Madagascar which realistically reproduces geography despite being generated only by comparison of words. The landing date of the ancestors of Malagasy is determined about 650 CE. This result is obtained by a straightforward approach based on the comparison of the UPGMA Malagasy family tree with the analogous tree of Romance family of languages for which all dates are well historically attested. We also propose an improved definition of Diversity computed for every locus in Madagascar and not only in places where the dialects were collected. Moreover, Diversity becomes a locally determined quantity as it is usually in biology. Diversity differences point to the South-East coast as the location where the first colonizers landed or, at least, where Malagasy variants started their dispersion. Finally, we find that the dialect spoken by the Mikea, a hunter-gatherer people in the South-West of Madagascar, is not very different from the variants of their neighbours Vezo and Masikoro. Therefore, Mikea unlikely can be linked to eventual aboriginal populations living in Madagascar prior to the main colonization event in 650 CE."
https://openalex.org/W3090072261,"Although foot and mouth disease (FMD) is endemic in Ethiopia, use of vaccines to control the disease has been practiced sparingly. This is due to perceived high cost of good quality FMD vaccine, and consequently limited availability of the vaccine in the market. This study was conducted to assess farmers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for a quality FMD vaccine and identify factors that could potentially influence their WTP in Amhara region of Ethiopia. A total of 398 farmers from four districts that represent the mixed crop-livestock and market oriented production systems were enrolled for the study. The WTP was estimated using contingent valuation method with a double-bound dichotomous choice bid design. Interval regression analysis was used to estimate mean WTP and identify factors that influence it. The results showed that the mean WTP of all farmers was Ethiopian Birr (ETB) 58.23 (95% CI: 56.20–60.26)/annual dose. It was ETB 75.23 (95% CI: 72. 97–74.49) for market oriented farmers and ETB 42.6 (95%CI: 41.24–43.96) for mixed crop livestock farmers. Willingness to pay for the vaccine was significantly higher for farmers in market oriented system than in mixed crop livestock system. It was also significantly higher for farmers whose main livelihood is livestock than those whose main livelihood is other than livestock, and for farmers who keep exotic breed cattle and their crosses than those who keep only local cattle breeds. Willingness to pay significantly increased with increase in FMD impact perception and vaccine knowledge scores of farmers. The high mean WTP estimates showed that farmers are enthusiastic about using the FMD vaccine. Market-oriented farmers with higher willingness to pay may be more likely to pay full cost if official FMD vaccination is planned in the country than mixed crop livestock farmers. Animal health extension about livestock diseases impact and vaccines has a potential to increase farmers’ uptake of vaccines for disease control."
https://openalex.org/W3090356396,"A large body of ongoing research focuses on understanding the mechanisms and processes underlying host-microbiome interactions, and predicting their ecological and evolutionary outcomes. To draw general conclusions about such interactions and understand how they are established, we must synthesize information from a diverse set of species. We analysed the microbiome of an important insect model–the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum–which is a widespread generalist pest of stored cereals. The beetles complete their entire life cycle in flour, which thus serves multiple functions: habitat, food, and a source of microbes. We determined key factors that shape the T. castaneum microbiome, established protocols to manipulate it, and tested its consequences for host fitness. We show that the T. castaneum microbiome is derived from flour-acquired microbes, and varies as a function of (flour) resource and beetle density. Beetles gain multiple fitness benefits from their microbiome, such as higher fecundity, egg survival, and lifespan; and reduced cannibalism. In contrast, the microbiome has a limited effect on development rate, and does not enhance pathogen resistance. Importantly, the benefits are derived only from microbes in the ancestral resource (wheat flour), and not from novel resources such as finger millet, sorghum, and corn. Notably, the microbiome is not essential for beetle survival and development under any of the tested conditions. Thus, the red flour beetle is a tractable model system to understand the ecology, evolution and mechanisms of host-microbiome interactions, while closely mimicking the host species’ natural niche."
https://openalex.org/W3091154589,"Organophosphates are among the most used pesticides. Particularly, chlorpyrifos (CPF) is responsible for a number of deleterious effects on brain development, which may program behavioral changes later in life. Here, we investigated whether a regimen of early low level CPF exposure that did not result in a significant inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) had deleterious effects on mood-related behaviors, as well as on cholinergic and serotonergic biomarkers in the mice brain. From the 3rd to 9th postnatal day (PN), male and female Swiss mice were subcutaneously injected with CPF. Mice were submitted to a battery of behavioral tests from PN60 to PN63: open field, elevated plus maze and forced swimming tests. The cholinergic and serotonergic biomarkers were assessed at PN10 and PN63. Our data indicated that early CPF exposure increased anxiety-like behavior in females and altered decision-making behavior in both sexes. Most biochemical alterations were sex-dependent and restricted to females. At PN10, CPF female mice showed increased serotonin and choline transporter binding in cerebral cortex. Distinctively, in adult females, the effects indicated a hypoactive state: CPF exposure reduced 5-HT1a receptor binding in cerebral cortex, as well as serotonin transporter binding and choline acetyltransferase activity in brainstem. Our results indicate that CPF exposure during the brain growth spurt deregulates serotonergic and cholinergic biomarkers. The effects are consistent with impaired synaptic function, may be related to long-term mood disorders and point out to higher female susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W3091204082,"Introduction Globally, around 30% of ever-partnered women have experienced physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence (IPV) during their lifetime. To date, most research into causes and prevention of IPV involves surveys of women, with little research into risk-factors for male perpetration. This paper describes a survey of male partners of women participating in the MAISHA cluster randomised trial (CRT) of an IPV prevention intervention, in Mwanza City, Tanzania. Using linked couples’ data, we explore man-, woman-, and relationship-/household-level factors associated with physical and sexual IPV. Methods Women were interviewed at baseline and 29-months follow-up. At follow-up, women were asked for consent to invite their partner to participate in the male survey. We describe response rates for the women’s follow-up and male partners’ surveys, and identify factors associated with women’s consent to approach partners. Multivariate logistic regression was used to explore factors associated with women’s past-year experiences of physical and sexual IPV. Results 512 (65%) partnered women consented for the partner to be approached, higher among intervention than control women. 425 (83%) male partners were interviewed. Women consenting were disproportionately likely to be in longer-term relationships. Past-year IPV was associated with lower consent among control women, but greater consent in the intervention arm. Factors associated with increased odds of physical IPV were women’s childhood experiences of abuse, young age, women’s lower income and women’s attitudes justifying IPV. Sexual IPV was associated with women’s childhood experiences of abuse, young age, educational disparity within couple, men’s alcohol use and women’s poor mental health. Conclusions We successfully conducted a survey of male partners with the full consent of women trial participants. The breadth of factors associated with IPV demonstrates the need for IPV prevention interventions to work with women and men, and specifically couples. Interventions should address risk-factors for both physical and sexual IPV."
https://openalex.org/W3091225905,"Background The achievement of the World Health Organization’s END TB goals will depend on the successful implementation of strategies for early diagnosis and retention of patients on effective therapy until cure. An estimated 150,000 cases are missed annually in South Africa. It is necessary to look at means for identifying these missed cases. This requires the implementation of active surveillance for TB, a policy adopted by the National Department of Health. Aim To explore the views of managers of the TB program on the implementation of active surveillance for TB in the resource constrained setting of the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Methods A descriptive, explorative, thematically analysed qualitative study based on 10 semi-structured interviews of managers of the TB program. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using the framework method and Atlas-ti. Results Active case finding of people attending health facilities was the dominant approach, although screening by community health workers (CHWs) was available. Both government and non-government organisations employed CHWs to screen door to door and sometimes as part of campaigns or community events. Some CHWs focused only on contact tracing or people that were non-adherent to TB treatment. Challenges for CHWs included poor coordination and duplication of services, failure to investigate those identified in the community, lack of transport and supportive supervision as well as security issues. Successes included expanding coverage by government CHW teams, innovations to improve screening, strategies to improve CHW capability and attention to social determinants. Conclusion A multifaceted facility- and community-based approach was seen as ideal for active surveillance. More resources should be targeted at strengthening teams of CHWs, for whom this would be part of a comprehensive and integrated service in a community-orientated primary care framework, and community engagement to strengthen community level interventions."

First, based on the indicator system of overseas investment risks, five major types of investment risks are identified. Second, the Deep Neural Network (DNN) is introduced; a risk evaluation model is constructed for enterprise overseas investment. Finally, the investment attractiveness index in the Fraser risk assessment learning label is adopted as the evaluation results of the model. According to the classification of risks, the model is trained and its performance is tested. The results show that the major source of overseas investment risks includes basic resources, political systems, economic and financial development, and environmental protection. The corresponding risk score is high. North American country clusters and Oceanian country clusters have lower investment risks, while the investment risks in Africa, Latin America, and Asia are affected by multiple factors of the specific cities. This is closely related to the resources and legal systems possessed by the country clusters. This is of great significance for enterprises to conduct risk assessment in overseas investment."

The aim of this study was to determine the courtship behaviour, mating and oviposition of unmated or mated C. noackae females parasitizing T. peregrinus eggs utilizing the same rearing system used in biological control programmes in Brazil. The mating behaviour of eleven C. noackae unmated couples was observed and the time taken for males and females to find each other in polystyrene vials and the duration and number of copulations were recorded. Ten unmated or mated females were placed individually in vials with 10 T. peregrinus eggs each, and oviposition behaviour, percentage of eggs inserted and parasitized, viability and sex ratio of emerged C. noackae were recorded. This species lacked defined courtship behaviour and mated in less than an hour after adults’ emergence. The time spent finding the first host, evaluating and inserting the ovipositor was similar for mated and unmated C. noackae females, as well as the frequency of inserted and parasitized eggs and their viability. Mated females took less time to find other host eggs and the sex ratio is female-biased. Occurrence of arrhenotokous parthenogenesis was confirmed. The ability of C. noackae to mate and lay eggs in less than one hour and parasitism of T. peregrinus eggs by females can improve the parasitoid mass rearing and biological control of T. peregrinus."

https://openalex.org/W3090495478,"Objectives 
Recently, the results of two economic evaluations were published both of which seemingly demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir-based regimens for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection in Germany. Both analyses were sponsored by the manufacturer of sofosbuvir and use a different methodology: Whereas one evaluation is based on a conventional cost-utility analysis, the other rests upon the efficiency-frontier method used by the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG). The purpose of this study is to reanalysis the results of both economic evaluations in combination.


Design 
Reanalysis of published decision modelling results.


Setting 
Primary care in Germany.


Participants 
Patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection (treatment-naive and -experienced, cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic).


Interventions 
Sofosbuvir, other anti-hepatitis C virus drugs, and no treatment.


Primary and secondary outcome measures 
Cost per unit of health benefit and cost per quality-adjusted life year.


Results 
Reanalysis of the results of both economic evaluations in combination reveals an unclear rationale for choosing the selected cost-effectiveness methods as well as a potential publication bias, favoring the product of the manufacturer. Based on the reanalysis, sofosbuvir is not cost-effective in treatment-experienced non-cirrhotic patients, potentially lacks cost-effectiveness in treatment-experienced cirrhotic patients, and is only partially cost-effective in treatment-naive non-cirrhotic patients. Taken together, these results indicate a lack of cost-effectiveness in three quarters of the German patient population.


Conclusions 
Two economic evaluations on sofosbuvir suggest, in combination, that sofosbuvir cannot be considered a cost-effective treatment in three quarters of the German patient population."
https://openalex.org/W3090576817,"We evaluate bioclimatic changes in Kazakhstan from the end of the 20th century until the middle of the 21st century to offer natural resource managers a tool that facilitates their decision-making on measures to adapt agriculture and environmental care to foreseeable climate change. We use climatic data from the ""Providing REgional Climates for Impact Studies"" (PRECIS) prediction and study them following the Worldwide Bioclimatic Classification System (WBCS) of Rivas-Martínez. For three 25-year intervals (1980-2004, 2010-2034 and 2035-2059), we identify the continentality, macrobioclimates, bioclimates, bioclimatic variants, thermotypes, ombrotypes and isobioclimates of the study area. The results of the work allow us to: locate the territories where bioclimatic conditions will change, quantify the magnitude of the predicted climate changes, and determine the trends of predictable climate change. We present the results in maps, tables and graphs. For the 80-year interval, we identify 3 macroclimates, 3 bioclimatic variants, 10 bioclimates, 11 thermotypes, 10 ombrotypes and 43 isobioclimates. Some of those found bioclimates, thermotypes, ombrotypes and isobioclimates are only located in the E, SE and S mountains, where they occupy very small areas, that decrease in a generalized way as the 20th century progresses. Comparing the three successive periods, the following trends are observed: 36.2% of the territory increases in thermicity; 7.3% of the territory increases in continentality; 9.7% of the territory increases in annual aridity; 9.5% of the territory increases in summer aridity or mediterraneity; and generalized losses occur in the areas of all mountain isobioclimates. The climate change foreseen by the PRECIS model for the middle of the 21st century leads to bioclimatic homogenization, with 20.8% losses in bioclimatic diversity. We indicate on maps the locations of all the predicted bioclimatic changes; these maps may provide decision makers with a scientific basis to take necessary adaptation measures."
https://openalex.org/W3091285779,"Background CLN3 disease is caused by mutations in the CLN3 gene. The purpose of this study is to discern global expression patterns reflecting therapeutic targets in CLN3 disease. Methods Differential gene expression in vehicle-exposed mouse brain was determined after intraperitoneal vehicle/Galactosylceramide (GalCer) injections for 40 weeks with GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays. Results Analysis identified 66 genes in male and 30 in female brains differentially expressed in GalCer-treated versus vehicle-exposed Cln3Δex7/8 mice. Gene ontology revealed aberrations of biological function including developmental, cellular, and behavioral processes. GalCer treatment altered pathways of long-term potentiation/depression, estrogen signaling, synaptic vesicle cycle, ErbB signaling, and prion diseases in males, but prolactin signaling, selenium compound metabolism and steroid biosynthesis in females. Gene-gene network analysis highlighted networks functionally pertinent to GalCer treatment encompassing motor dysfunction, neurodegeneration, memory disorder, inflammation and astrogliosis in males, and, cataracts, inflammation, astrogliosis, and anxiety in females. Conclusions This study sheds light on global expression patterns following GalCer treatment of Cln3Δex7/8 mice. Understanding molecular effects of GalCer on mouse brain gene expression, paves the way for personalized strategies for treating this debilitating disease in humans."
https://openalex.org/W3089517335,"Introduction Most research depicts older adults as needing personal care, with limited research on older adults’ contributions in the lives of others in developing countries like Ghana. The purpose of the study was to examine the personal care provision and socio-demographic correlates of personal care provision by older adult inpatients in Ghana. Materials and methods A hospital-based survey was conducted among 400 consecutively surveyed older adult inpatients at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in southern Ghana. Stata 15 was used to analyse the data. The relationship between personal care and older adult inpatients’ socio-demographic characteristics were analysed using the chi-square test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed. Results Overall, 28% of older adult inpatients provided personal care. Participants were mostly females, married or cohabiting, completed at most junior high school, Christians, urban residents, not working and living with their immediate family. Primarily, most participants provided personal care to one person, once a week, and one-hour duration. Nearly three-quarters of participants provided personal care to someone who lives with them. After adjustment, male older adults were 50% less likely to and urban residents were 83% more likely to provide personal care. Being single, separated or divorced was statistically significantly associated with personal care provision, however, were not statistically significant after adjusting for sex and residence. A post hoc analysis testing for interaction revealed no relationship existing between sex and marital status concerning personal care provision (p = 0.106). Conclusion Female and urban resident older adult inpatients in Ghana are not just passive receivers of care but also provide personal care to others with functional difficulties, independent on age. It further draws attention to the need for policies and programs that can support older adults, particularly females and urban residents, to be productive in the later life."
https://openalex.org/W3089397315,"Fuyin-lethal red egg (Fuyin-lre) is a red egg mutant discovered from the germplasm resource Fuyin of Bombyx mori. The embryo of Fuyin-lre stops developing at the late stage of gastrulation due to chromosome structural variation. In this work, precise mutation sites at both ends of the mutated region were determined, and two inserted sequences with lengths of 1232 bp and 1845 bp were obtained at both ends of the mutation region. Interestingly, a bmmar1 transposon was detected in the inserted 1845 bp sequence. Bmmar1 possesses features of the Tcl/mariner superfamily of transposable elements (TEs), which belongs to class II TEs that use a DNA-mediated ""cut and paste"" mechanism to transpose. This finding suggests that Fuyin-lre mutation might be related to the ""cut and paste"" action of bmmar1. The mutation resulted in the deletion of 9 genes in the mutation region, of which the red egg gene re (BMSK0002766) did not affect embryonic development of B. mori, and the BMSK0002765 gene was unexpressed during the early stage of embryonic development. The RNA interference results of the remaining 7 genes suggest that the semaphorin-1a-like gene (BMSK0002764) had a major contribution to the embryonic lethality of Fuyin-lre."
https://openalex.org/W3089664166,"The prevalence of criticism in everyday social situations, and its empirically demonstrated association with psychopathology, highlight the importance of understanding neural mechanisms underlying the perception and response of individuals to criticism. However, neuroimaging studies to date have been limited largely to maternal criticism. The present study aims to investigate neural responses to observing criticism occurring in the context of three different relationship types: romantic partners, friends, and parents–from a third-party perspective. 49 participants were recruited and asked to rate the perceived criticism for these relationships. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy was used to measure changes in oxygenated haemoglobin levels in the prefrontal cortex when participants read vignettes describing three different scenarios of criticism. Participants were randomly assigned to 3 groups where the given description of the relationship of the protagonist to the source of criticism for each vignette was randomised. A significant interaction between relationship type and perceived criticism ratings for mothers was found in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Compared to low perceived criticism, high perceived criticism individuals showed increased activation reading vignettes describing criticism from romantic partners and parents but decreased activation for those from friends. Findings contribute to understanding neural responses to criticism as observed from a third-party perspective. Future studies can look into differentiating neural responses of personalised experiences of criticism and third-party observations."

A total of 845 patients with mild and general COVID-19 who were considered to be discharged from hospital were included in this study. The median time from the onset of COVID-19 to the occurrence of two consecutive negative nucleic acid tests of these patients was 21 days. 223 of the 845 patients were tested again after two consecutive negative nucleic acid tests and 17.49% of the patients were positive. Moreover, 82.51% (184 of 223) of these patients experienced negative results from three consecutive nucleic acid tests, the median time from the onset of COVID-19 to the occurrence of three consecutive negative nucleic acid tests was 23 days (range: 3–56 days), and 38 of which were further tested after three consecutive negative nucleic acid tests, while about 5.26% (2 of 38) patients showed positive nucleic acid test results. Thus, we suggested that the patient should be negative for at least 3 consecutive nucleic acid tests before discharge, and the test time should be no earlier than the 23rd day since the onset of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3091230652,"Male and female mosquito larvae compete for different subsets of the yeast food resource in laboratory microcosms. Males compete more intensely with males, and females with females. The amount and timing of food inputs alters both growth and competition, but the effects are different between sexes. Increased density increases competition among males. Among females, density operates primarily by changing the food/larva or total food; this affects competition in some interactions and growth in others. Food added earlier in the life span contributes more to mass than the same quantity added later. After a period of starvation larvae appear to use some of the subsequent food input to rebuild physiological reserves in addition to building mass. The timing of pupation is affected by the independent factors and competition, but not in the same way for the two sexes, and not in the same way as mass at pupation for the two sexes. There is an effect of density on the timing of pupation for females independent of competition or changes in food/larva or total food. Male and female larvae have different larval life history strategies. Males grow quickly to a minimum size, then pupate, depending on the amount of food available. Males that do not grow quickly enough may delay pupation further to grow larger, resulting in a bimodal distribution of sizes and ages. Males appear to have a maximum size determined by the early food level. Females grow faster than males and grow larger than males on the same food inputs. Females affect the growth and competition among males by manipulating the number of particles in the microcosm through changes in feeding behavior. Mosquito larvae appear to have evolved to survive periods of starvation and take advantage of intermittent inputs of food into containers."
https://openalex.org/W3089353883,"To use velocity vector imaging (VVI) technology to evaluate the correlation between the apical four-chamber view and short-axis myocardial movement in rats.We used 25 10-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats to measure the myocardium peak systolic velocity (Vs; cm/s), peak diastolic velocity (Vd; cm/s), peak systolic strain (SR; %), peak systolic strain rate (SRs; 1/s), and peak diastolic strain rate (SRd; 1/s) from the apical four-chamber view of the left ventricle (LV) and the parasternal mitral valve (PMV)-level short-axis view, and to analyze the correlation between myocardial motion in corresponding views of the two sections.Comparing the myocardial motion between the lateral wall's basal segment in the apical four-chamber view of the LV and the lateral wall of the PMV-level short-axis view revealed that the Vd was positively correlated (r = 0.59, p<0.01), as was SRs (r = 0.68, p<0.05). Comparing the myocardial motion between the lateral wall's middle segment in the apical four-chamber view of the LV and the lateral wall of the PMV-level short-axis view demonstrated that Vd, SRs, and SRd were positively correlated (r = 0.63, 0.82, 0.79, respectively, all p<0.01). Our comparison of myocardial motion between the posterior septum's basal segment in the apical four-chamber view of the LV and the posterior septum of PMV-level short-axis view showed that Vd and SRs were positively correlated (r = 0.57, 0.68, respectively, both p<0.01). Comparing the myocardial motion between the posterior septum's middle segment in the apical four-chamber view of the LV and the posterior septum of the PMV-level short-axis view revealed that Vs, Vd, SR, and SRd were positively correlated (r = 0.89, 0.63, 0.64, 0.6, respectively, all p<0.01), and the SRs also had a significant positive correlation (r = 0.53, p<0.05).VVI technology could be a valuable tool for evaluating the myocardial walls motion of the apical four-chamber view of the rat LV."
