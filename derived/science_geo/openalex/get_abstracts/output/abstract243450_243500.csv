https://openalex.org/W2153720415,"Both activating and null mutations of proteins required for canonical WNT signaling have revealed the importance of this pathway for normal skeletal development. However, tissue-specific transcriptional mechanisms through which WNT signaling promotes the differentiation of bone-forming cells have yet to be identified. Here, we address the hypothesis that canonical WNT signaling and the bone-related transcription factor RUNX2/CBFA1/AML3 are functionally linked components of a pathway required for the onset of osteoblast differentiation. Our findings show that, in bone of the SFRP1 (secreted frizzled-related protein-1)-null mouse, which exhibits activated WNT signaling and a high bone mass phenotype, there is a significant increase in expression of T-cell factor (TCF)-1, Runx2, and the RUNX2 target gene osteocalcin. We demonstrate by mutational analysis that a functional TCF regulatory element responsive to canonical WNT signaling resides in the promoter of the Runx2 gene (-97 to -93). By chromatin immunoprecipitation, recruitment of beta-catenin and TCF1 to the endogenous Runx2 gene is shown. Coexpression of TCF1 with canonical WNT proteins resulted in a 2-5-fold activation of Runx2 promoter activity and a 7-8-fold induction of endogenous mRNA in mouse pluripotent mesenchymal and osteoprogenitor cells. This enhancement was abrogated by SFRP1. Taken together, our results provide evidence for direct regulation of Runx2 by canonical WNT signaling and suggest that Runx2 is a target of beta-catenin/TCF1 for the stimulation of bone formation. We propose that WNT/TCF1 signaling, like bone morphogenetic protein/transforming growth factor-beta signaling, activates Runx2 gene expression in mesenchymal cells for the control of osteoblast differentiation and skeletal development."
https://openalex.org/W1996783118,"As a primary target for opioid drugs and peptides, the mu opioid receptor (OPRM1) plays a key role in pain perception and addiction. Genetic variants of OPRM1 have been implicated in predisposition to drug addiction, in particular the single nucleotide polymorphism A118G, leading to an N40D substitution, with an allele frequency of 10–32%, and uncertain functions. We have measured allele-specific mRNA expression of OPRM1 in human autopsy brain tissues, using A118G as a marker. In 8 heterozygous samples measured, the A118 mRNA allele was 1.5–2.5-fold more abundant than the G118 allele. Transfection into Chinese hamster ovary cells of a cDNA representing only the coding region of OPRM1, carrying adenosine, guanosine, cytidine, and thymidine in position 118, resulted in 1.5-fold lower mRNA levels only for OPRM1-G118, and more than 10-fold lower OPRM1 protein levels, measured by Western blotting and receptor binding assay. After transfection and inhibition of transcription with actinomycin D, analysis of mRNA turnover failed to reveal differences in mRNA stability between A118 and G118 alleles, indicating a defect in transcription or mRNA maturation. These results indicate that OPRM1-G118 is a functional variant with deleterious effects on both mRNA and protein yield. Clarifying the functional relevance of polymorphisms associated with susceptibility to a complex disorder such as drug addiction provides a foundation for clinical association studies.

Clarifying the functional relevance of polymorphisms associated with susceptibility to a complex disorder such as drug addiction provides a foundation for clinical association studies. Drug addiction is a complex disorder with a strong genetic component (1Kreek M.J. Mol. Psychiatry. 1996; 1: 232-254PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kreek M.J. Nielsen D.A. LaForge K.S. Neuromol. Med. 2004; 5: 85-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Serving as a primary target for opioid drugs and peptides, the mu opioid receptor (OPRM1) mediates the effects of morphine and heroin (3Basbaum A.I. Fields H.L. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1984; 7: 309-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar, 4Kreek M.J. Neurochem. Res. 1996; 21: 1469-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). By impinging on dopaminergic pathways, OPRM1 also plays a role in addiction to other drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, nicotine, and alcohol (5Kreek M.J. J. Addict. Dis. 1996; 15: 73-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 6Herz A. Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 1997; 129: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Because of its central role in drug addiction, numerous studies have addressed potential contributions of polymorphisms in the gene encoding OPRM1 to addiction susceptibility (7Hoehe M.R. Kopke K.

Among multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 2The abbreviations used are: SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ActD, actinomycin D.2The abbreviations used are: SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ActD, actinomycin D. in OPRM1, C17T (A6V), and A118G (N40D) are well studied nonsynonymous SNPs located at the N terminus of the receptor. In particular, A118G, with an allele frequency of 10–32% in different ethnic groups (9LaForge K.S. Yuferov V. Kreek M.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 410: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), has been associated with susceptibility to heroin, nicotine, and alcohol addiction (10Tan E.C. Tan C.H. Karupathivan U.

The A118G polymorphism has also been linked to differences in pharmacological properties of OPRM1. In a Swedish population, the G118 variant was shown to correlate with poor response to naltrexone in the treatment of alcoholism (15Bart G. Heilig M. LaForge K.S. Pollak L. Leal S.M. Ott J. Kreek M.J. Mol. Psychiatry. 2004; 9: 547-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Moreover, OPRM1-antagonist naloxone elicited an increased cortisol response in individuals with a G118 allele (16Hernandez-Avila C.A. Wand G. Luo X. Gelernter J. Kranzler H.R. Am. J. Med.

In transfected cells, OPRM1-Asp40 was reported to have 3-fold higher affinity for β-endorphin than OPRM1-Asn40 (18Bond C. LaForge K.S. Tian M. Melia D. Zhang S. Borg L. Gong J. Schluger J.

Schulz S. Hollt V. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In vitro transfection studies, however, indicated that the G118 allele might be associated with lower OPRM1 protein expression than the A118 allele (20Beyer A. Koch T. Schroder H. Schulz S. Hollt V.

Therefore, the functional significance of the A118G variant of OPRM1 remained unresolved. cis-Acting functional polymorphisms that affect transcription, mRNA processing, mRNA stability, and protein translation, rather than primary protein structure, may represent a main cause of human phenotypic variability (21Lo H.S.

Wang D. Sadee W. Pharmacol. Ther. 2005; 106: 19-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Measuring allelic imbalance of mRNA expression has proven to be a powerful tool in detecting such cis-acting polymorphisms (25Yan H. Zhou W. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2004; 16: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26Bray N.J. Buckland P.R. Williams N.M. Williams H.J. Norton N. Owen M.J. O'Donovan M.C. Am. J. Hum.

Psychiatry. 2004; 9: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this approach, one measures the expression of each of two alleles simultaneously in a target tissue of heterozygous individuals, thereby, eliminating the influence of trans-acting factors. In this study, we have measured allelic OPRM1 mRNA expression, using A118G as the indicator SNP, in human brain tissues (autopsies). We have also determined mRNA and protein expression in CHO cells, after transfection of plasmids carrying the OPRM1 coding region, with A, G, C, and T substituted at position 118. The results demonstrate that the A118G substitution in OPRM1 causes significantly reduced yields of mRNA and receptor protein, indicating a loss of function. Human Brain Tissues—87 human post-mortem brain tissue samples were obtained from different sources as follows: 16 from Cooperative Human Tissue Network, Philadelphia, PA, and 12 from the Department of Pathology, Ohio State University (mainly cortical tissues samples); 10 human pons tissues from the Brain and Tissue Bank, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, and 49 pons section slides from Stanley Research Medical Foundation (Bethesda, MD). Genomic DNA and RNA Preparation—Genomic DNA and RNA were prepared from frozen brain samples or pons section slides. Tissue samples were treated with sucrose-Triton and digested with proteinase K, followed by sodium chloride precipitation of protein and ethanol precipitation of DNA. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified using Qiagen RNeasy columns according to the manufacturer's instructions. Before reverse transcription, total RNA was treated with DNase I (Ambion) at 37 °C for 30 min. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated from 1 μg of total RNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), using oligo(dT) and OPRM1-specific primers targeting a region 3′ of A118G (primer for cDNA synthesis: 5′-CAGGTCGGTGCGGTTC). Genotyping of OPRM1—A118G and C17T were scored in genomic DNA prepared from 87 brain tissue samples using SNaPshot (Applied Biosystems, CA) as described below. SNaPshot and Quantitative Analysis of Allelic Ratios in mRNA and Genomic DNA—SNaPshot was performed as described previously (28Pinsonneault J. Nielsen C.U. Sadee W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 311: 1088-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In brief, a section of DNA or cDNA surrounding the SNP (∼100 bp) was amplified by PCR using amplification primers (forward: 5′-GGTTCCTGGGTCAACTTGTC, reverse: 5′-CAGGTCGGTGCGGTTC) under the following PCR conditions: 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C 1 min. For the analysis of C17T, the following PCR primers were used, under the same conditions (forward: 5′-CCGTCAGTACCATGGACAGC-3′, reverse: 5′-GAGTACGCCAAGGCATCAGT-3′). After PCR, residual primers and unincorporated dNTPs were inactivated by incubating at 37 °C for 3 h with 5 units of Antarctic Phosphatase and 2 units of ExoI (New England Biolabs). The purified PCR products were then analyzed using a primer extension method (SNaPshot). The extension primers were designed to anneal to the amplified template DNA immediately adjacent to the A118G site. Subsequent extension with DNA polymerase added a single fluorescent dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (ddNTP) complementary to the nucleotide at the polymorphic site. The extended primers, labeled with different fluorescent dyes were run on an ABI 3730 capillary electrophoresis instrument, and analyzed with Gene Mapper 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Peak area ratios were calculated to measure the relative amount of DNA (cDNA) of the two alleles. Control experiments with known mixtures of plasmids carrying different nucleotides in the A118 position demonstrated that peak areas and ratios were linearly related to added amounts of DNA (cDNA). Because of differences in fluorescent yield and terminator dye incorporation, measured peak area ratios differed from unity when a 1:1 ratio of allelic DNA was added, depending on the incorporated fluorescent dye. For each brain tissue, peak area ratios were measured for both genomic DNA and mRNA (cDNA). Assuming that the two alleles were present in equal amounts in genomic DNA, measured DNA and cDNA ratios were normalized to the average of genomic DNA ratios using the equation: normalized ratio = measured DNA (or cDNA) ratio/mean of genomic DNA ratio. For genomic DNA, none of the samples significantly deviated from the expected unity, indicating that the alleles were present in equal quantities in the tissues analyzed (absence of gene dosage effects on allelic expression levels). As an added control, extension primers for A118G were used in both orientations in separate analyses, and DNA and mRNA (cDNA) ratios were calculated in the same fashion to test for any artifacts that may have been introduced by fluorescent dye bias (forward primer: 5′-ACTGATCGACTTGTCCCACTTAGATGGC-3′, reverse primer: 5′-ACTGACTGACTGACCATGGGTCGGACAGGT-3′). For C17T, the extension primer was 5′-ATTGCTGGCGTTCGTGGGG-3′. Allelic ratios of A118/G118 and C17/T17 were measured in all heterozygous brain tissues (8 samples for A118G and 1 sample for C17T) by determining peak area ratios. For cDNA preparations, each mRNA sample was converted to cDNA in three separate experiments, and each cDNA sample was analyzed at least twice using SNaPshot. mRNA Analysis Using Real-time PCR—To quantify mRNA expression of the genotyped samples, we first set up a standard curve using various amount (50 fg to 100 pg) of plasmid DNA (OPRM1), performed with real-time PCR with the same PCR amplification primers used for SNaPshot, with 12.5 μl of 2× PCR SYBR master mixture (3 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dATP, 200 μm dCTP, 200 μm dGTP, 200 μm dUTP, 0.625 units of AmpliTaq Gold, and 0.25 units of AmpErase UNG). The mixtures were run on an ABI 7000 with the same PCR conditions, and threshold cycles were measured. OPRM1 cDNA levels were calculated from the obtained standard curve. As an internal control, β-actin was amplified for the same samples, and expression levels were determined by a standard curve using different dilutions of a mixture composed of cDNAs from all analyzed samples. The cDNA expression level of each sample was expressed as the ratio of OPRM1 over β-actin. To detect any possible DNA contamination, real-time PCR was also performed in RNA control samples in the absence of reverse transcriptase during cDNA synthesis. mRNA Secondary Structure Prediction—The mRNA secondary structure of OPRM1 (reference sequence AY521028) was predicted using Mfold (Unix and Web versions 3.1.2) (29Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (9968) Google Scholar). Custom-designed Perl scripts created new sequences representing every possible transition SNP in the coding region (n = 1203), including A118G. Sequences were folded in an automated manner with Mfold (Unix Version). The maximum number of folding parameter was set based on the optimum of the wild-type sequence (n = 19). For a given RNA sequence, the resulting single-stranded counts measured the number of times each nucleotide was unpaired across all predicted secondary structures (30Zuker M. Jacobson A.B. RNA (N.Y.). 1998; 4: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We calculated the change in single-stranded counts at each nucleotide in each set of SNP structures relative to wild-type structures (12032 differences). Differences in single-stranded counts for each SNP sequence were analyzed regionally (in nucleotide windows surrounding the SNP) and globally (across the full sequence) as a measure of the relative amount of structural variation predicted to occur in response to a given SNP. Full-length RNA structures for A118, G118, C118, and T118 were predicted using the Mfold web server. All structures (optimal and suboptimal) were visualized, and heuristics were considered to determine motif changes in the A118G region. OPRM1 Expression Constructs and Mutagenesis—A 1.2-kb fragment containing the human OPRM1 coding region cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, CA) using KpnI and XhoI sites. PCR was used to introduce the mutations at position 118 using the following mutagenesis primers (the mutated sites are in bold): A118G (T,C), 5′-CACTTAGATGGCG(T,C)ACCTGTCCGAC-3′. A 473-bp section of OPRM1 was amplified with PCR using the mutagenesis primers and a common reverse primer (5′-CGGGATCCAGTTGCAGACATTGA-3′, with a BamHI site). The generated 473-bp fragments, together with a common forward primer (5′-GGGGTACCCGATGGACAGCAGCGCT-3′, with a KpnI site) were used to amplify a 581-bp 5′-fragment of OPRM1. Digestion with KpnI and BamHI and ligation into a 3′-fragment from wild type OPRM1 in pcDNA3 vector yielded full-length coding regions. For each construct, 2 clones were isolated. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—CHO-K1 cells were cultured in F-12 nutrient medium (Invitrogen) supplement with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Twenty-four hours before transfection, cells were seeded into 6or 12-well dishes. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. mRNA Stability Assay—Twenty-four hours after transfection, actinomycin D (ActD) (10 μg/ml) was added to inhibit transcription, and the cells were collected 1, 2, 6, and 12 h after treatment. Control cells were cultured for the same time period without ActD treatment. For plasmid DNA preparation, cells were trypsinized and collected. Plasmid DNA was prepared using a Qiagen DNA miniprep kit. For RNA preparation, cells were lysed with TRIzol reagent and prepared as described above. OPRM1 mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR using PCR amplification primers as described above for SNaPshot. OPRM1 Binding Assay—CHO cells in 12-well plates (polylysine coated) were transfected with 2 μg of wild type or variant OPRM1 plasmids. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with 2 nm [3H]diprenorphine (Amersham Biosciences, CA, 50 Ci/mmol) in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.5) for 1 h at 37°C. Then, cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and dissolved with 1 n NaOH. The cell lysates were transferred to scintillation vials and radioactivity was determined with a LS-6500 Multipurpose scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter). Nonspecific binding was determined by adding naloxone (20 μm) before adding [3H]diprenorphine, which was subtracted from total binding. Western Blotting Analysis—Twenty-four hours after the transfection of wild type and variant OPRM1 into CHO cells plated in 6-well plates, cells were dissolved in 250 μ l of 2× SDS loading buffer (62.5 mm TrisHCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad)), and incubated at 95 °C for 10 min. Samples (40 μl) were run on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Western blotting was performed using rabbit antibodies directed against the OPRM1 C-terminal (Incstar, Stillwater, MN), followed by detection with ECL Hyperfilm kit (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was then stripped with stripping buffer (100 mm 2-mercaptoethonal, 2%SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7), followed by incubation with mouse anti-α-tubulin antibodies (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA) and detection with ECL Hyperfilm kit. Statistical Analyses—Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using the program GraphPad Prism version 3.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software (San Diego, CA). Genotyping Results—We have genotyped 87 samples for A118G and C17T using SNaPshot reaction. For SNP A118G, 76 were AA, (87.4%), 8 were heterozygous AG (9.2%), and 3 were GG (3.4%). For SNP C17T, only one heterozygote was detected, all others were CC. The C17T heterozygote was homozygous for A118. Allelic frequencies were at the lower end of previously observed frequencies in various ethnic populations (8Luo X. Kranzler H.R. Zhao H. Gelernter J. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2003; 120: 97-108Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18Bond C. LaForge K.S. Tian M. Melia D. Zhang S. Borg L. Gong J. Schluger J. Strong J.A. Leal S.M. Tischfield J.A. Kreek M.J. Yu L. Proc.

Allelic Expression of OPRM1 in Human Brain, Using A118G as the Indicator SNP—We identified 8 heterozygous samples for OPRM1 A118G, suitable for allelic expression analysis. Genomic DNA and total RNA were isolated from brain tissues, and mRNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a gene-specific primer and oligo(dT). cDNA synthesis using only oligo(dT) failed in brain tissue extracts because the coding region is far removed from the poly(A) tail of OPRM1, and because of partial mRNA degradation. After PCR amplification of the cDNA generated from the gene-specific primer (located in proximity of A118) and oligo(dT), we used SNaPshot to measure the peak area ratios of A118/G118 for genomic DNA and cDNA. Control experiments with mixtures of plasmids carrying A118 and G118-OPRM1 demonstrated that the measured ratios were proportional to amounts of each plasmid DNA added (Pearson analysis r = 0.992, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1a). Genomic DNA ratios did not differ significantly between samples and were normalized to 1 (25Yan H. Zhou W. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2004; 16: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 31Le Hellard S. Ballereau S.J. Visscher P.M. Torrance H.S. Pinson J. Morris S.W. Thomson M.L. Semple C.A. Muir W.J. Blackwood D.H. Porteous D.J. Evans K.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e74Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The S.D. was 0.13, indicating that the assay can detect ratio differences of ∼25% (2× S.D.) (TABLE ONE). mRNA ratios were determined in duplicate from 3 independent cDNA samples. After normalization to the genomic DNA ratio, the A118/G118 ratios for mRNA (or cDNA) ranged from 1.5 to 2.5, significantly different from the DNA ratios (p < 0.01) (TABLE ONE, Fig. 2a). Repeat of the same experiment using a reverse extension primer, causing incorporation of different dideoxy terminators to test for fluorescent dye artifacts, gave similar results, showing all that 8 samples have significant allelic ratio differences between cDNA and DNA (TABLE ONE, Fig. 2a). This result indicates that the level of mRNA from the wild-type A118 allele yielded ∼2-fold higher mRNA levels than the G118 allele in heterozygous brain tissues.TABLE ONEPeak area ratios for mRNA and DNA for 8 A118G heterozygous brain samples analyzed by SNaPshotSample IDA/G peak area ratios (A118G)Forward primer extension primerReverse primer extension primerObserved ratiosNormalized ratiosObserved ratiosNormalized ratiosDNA (n = 3)mRNA (cDNA) (n = 6)DNAmRNA (cDNA)DNA (n = 3)mRNA (cDNA) (n = 3)DNA ratiosmRNA (cDNA)11.03 ± 0.252.13 ± 0.410.96 ± 0.272.02 ± 0.383.59 ± 0.405.44 ± 0.301.03 ± 0.111.56 ± 0.3021.22 ± 0.332.33 ± 0.271.13 ± 0.362.18 ± 0.253.59 ± 0.169.22 ± 0.601.03 ± 0.052.78 ± 0.1731.26 ± 0.262.72 ± 0.231.17 ± 0.172.53 ± 0.213.27 ± 0.098.96 ± 0.040.93 ± 0.032.56 ± 0.0141.00 ± 0.112.14 ± 0.020.92 ± 0.121.98 ± 0.013.40 ± 0.357.17 ± 0.280.97 ± 0.102.05 ± 0.0850.87 ± 0.211.56 ± 0.480.81 ± 0.221.51 ± 0.443.34 ± 0.166.52 ± 0.180.95 ± 0.051.86 ± 0.0561.21 ± 0.091.65 ± 0.401.12 ± 0.081.57 ± 0.373.54 ± 0.606.42 ± 1.011.01 ± 0.171.83 ± 0.2971.04 ± 0.131.86 ± 0.010.96 ± 0.141.72 ± 0.004.45 ± 0.135.40 ± 0.351.27 ± 0.041.54 ± 0.1081.22 ± 0.071.93 ± 0.211.13 ± 0.081.80 ± 0.193.10 ± 0.185.43 ± 0.510.89 ± 0.051.55 ± 0.15Mean ± S.D.1.11 ± 0.131.00 ± 0.133.50 ± 0.181.00 ± 0.12 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Panel a, allele-specific mRNA expression of OPRM1 in heterozygous human brain samples using indicator SNPs A118G (8 samples) and C17T (1 sample). SNaPshot was employed to measure peak areas of A over G,or C over T alleles in both genomic DNA and cDNA samples. cDNA ratios were normalized to the ratio for genomic DNA. Three independent cDNA samples were prepared and SNaPshot assays performed twice for each cDNA preparation. Data are mean ± S.D. Both forward and reverse extension primer were used for A118G as a marker. Compared with the DNA ratio, cDNA ratios are significantly higher, p < 0.01, in 8 A118G heterozygote samples (both primers) but not in the single C17T heterozygous sample, p > 0.05 (one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett's post-test).

Even though there was only one heterozygous sample (number 9), the assay permits statistical analysis between the two alleles. The mRNA expression ratio for C/T was 1.10 ± 0.04 (normalized by DNA ratios), not significantly different from genomic DNA (TABLE TWO, Fig. 2a). Because the heterozygous C17T sample is homozygous for A118, this single result rules out any contribution of C17T, but implicates further A118G as playing a role in the allelic expression imbalance.TABLE TWOPeak area ratios for mRNA and DNA for one C17T heterozygous brain sample analyzed by SNaPshotC/T peak area ration (C17T), Forward primer extension primerSample IDObserved ratiosNormalized ratiosDNA (n = 3)mRNA (cDNA) (n = 3)DNAmRNA (cDNA)91.03 ± 0.031.13 ± 0.041.00 ± 0.031.10 ± 0.04 Open table in a new tab Reverse Transcriptase-PCR of OPRM1 mRNA in Brain Samples—We separated the samples into two groups according to brain areas, i.e. cortical lobe and pons section samples (Stanley Foundation). Each group consisted of three genotypes for A118G (cortical sample group: AA, n = 5, AG, n = 3, and GG, n = 2; Stanley pons section samples: AA, n = 8, AG, n = 4, and GG, n = 1). Real-time PCR was performed to amplify the cDNA using OPRM1 and β-actin amplification primers separately, and cycle thresholds were used to calculate the mRNA expression. The overall mRNA expression of OPRM1 was lower in pons section samples, as indicated by the ratios of OPRM1/β-actin (Fig. 2, b and c). For each group, G118 homozygotes displayed less expression than A118 (Fig. 2, b and c). However, the relatively small number of samples, particularly of G118 homozygotes, precluded statistical analysis. Therefore, this experiment merely suggests a trend toward lower G118 mRNA levels. mRNA Expression of OPRM1 Variants in Transiently Transfected CHO Cells—We next tested whether transient expression of vectors containing only the coding region also show different mRNA expression for OPRM1-A118 and -G118. Equal amounts of OPRM1-A118 and -G118 plasmids were co-transfected into CHO cells, and total RNA and plasmid DNA were isolated. Real-time PCR revealed no amplification of DNA and mRNA for hamster OPRM1 in untransfected CHO cells, with cycle thresholds >30 cycles, similar to no-template control. The same control experiments were done to exclude the possibility of DNA contamination in the analysis of cDNA using samples without adding reverse transcriptase, again with negative results. As in brain tissues, the ratios of A118/G118 in plasmid DNA and mRNA (cDNA) were determined with SNaPshot. After normalization to the plasmid DNA ratio measured at each time point, the mRNA ratio of A/G was determined to be 1.52 ± 0.03 (n = 6), obtained from three independent experiments, and 2 different OPRM1 clones for each construct. This was significantly higher than the DNA ratio at 24 h after transfection (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3a), again indicating that OPRM1-A118 yielded higher mRNA expression than OPRM1-G118, even though the plasmids contained only the coding region of OPRM1. To determine whether the functional change is specific to the A118G transition, we constructed OPRM1 expression vectors with A118C and A118T substitutions. CHO cells were co-transfected with equal amounts of OPRM1-A118 and either OPRM1-C118 or OPRM1-T118. Twenty-four hours after transfection, DNA and total RNA were isolated, and the ratios of A118/C118 and A118/T118 were measured in DNA and RNA samples. Control experiments with mixtures of two plasmids (A118+C118 or A118+T118 with 5 dif"

The purpose of this study was to determine if there is altered renal lipid metabolism and increased expression of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) in a model of diet-induced obesity. C57BL/6J mice that were fed a high fat, 60 kcal % saturated (lard) fat diet (HFD) developed obesity, hyperglycemia, and hyperinsulinemia compared with those that were fed a low fat, 10 kcal % fat diet (LFD). In contrast, A/J mice were resistant when fed the same diet. C57BL/6J mice with HFD exhibited significantly higher levels of renal SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 expression than those mice with LFD, whereas in A/J mice there were no changes with the same treatment. The increases in SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 expression in C57BL/6J mice resulted in renal accumulation of triglyceride and cholesterol. There were also significant increases in the renal expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), type IV collagen, and fibronectin, resulting in glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria. To determine a role for SREBPs per se in modulating renal lipid metabolism and glomerulosclerosis we performed studies in SREBP-1c–/– mice. In contrast to control mice, in the SREBP-1c–/– mice with HFD the accumulation of triglyceride was prevented, as well as the increases in PAI-1, VEGF, type IV collagen, and fibronectin expression. Our results therefore suggest that diet-induced obesity causes increased renal lipid accumulation and glomerulosclerosis in C57BL/6J mice via an SREBP-1c-dependent pathway.

Obesity is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease (1U. S. Department of Health and Human Services JAMA. 1996; 276: 522PubMed Google Scholar) and type-2 diabetes mellitus (2Kissebah A.H.

Nephrol. 2004; 15: 2768-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Obesity is one of the defining criteria of the metabolic syndrome as proposed by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (4National Institutes of Health Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III).

Definition, Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus and Its Complications. Part1: Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus.

The metabolic syndrome, which is characterized by the concurrent existence of obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertension, has been shown to be a strong and independent risk factor for cardiovascular, and all cause mortality (6Lakka H.M.

Batuman V. Fonseca V. Whelton P.K. He J. Ann. Intern. Med. 2004; 140: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Obesity is considered a major generator of metabolic syndrome (9Bagby S.P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 2775-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Early in the course of obesity-initiated metabolic syndrome, structural and functional changes similar to diabetic kidney disease occur (10Henegar J.R. Bigler S.A. Henegar L.K. Tyagi S.C. Hall J.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 1211-1217PubMed Google Scholar). These changes include glomerular hyperfiltration, glomerular basement membrane thickening, mesangial cell proliferation, mesangial matrix thickening, and expansion of Bowman's capsule (10Henegar J.R. Bigler S.A. Henegar L.K. Tyagi S.C. Hall J.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 1211-1217PubMed Google Scholar) and are considered precursors to more severe renal injury. Severe obesity has been associated with the eventual development of focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (11Praga M. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2002; 17: 1157-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although incompletely understood, several hemodynamic, hormonal, and metabolic factors have been proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of nephropathy associated with metabolic syndrome, including intrarenal hypertension and hyperfiltration, oxidative stress, angiotensin II, inflammatory cytokines, hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance, hyperglycemia/diabetes, and abnormal lipid metabolism (3Abrass C.K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 2768-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 9Bagby S.P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 2775-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 11Praga M.

Dewitt, NY1860: 383-408Google Scholar) first suggested the association between lipids and renal disease in 1858 when he described successive stages of fatty metamorphosis and fatty detritus in the renal epithelium in Bright's disease. In their classic paper in 1936 describing the pathological sign of nodular sclerosis Kimmelstiel and Wilson (16Kimmelstiel P. Wilson C. Am. J. Pathol. 1936; 12: 83-98PubMed Google Scholar) also demonstrated the presence of lipid deposits in the kidneys of diabetic patients, and they suggested that these lipids play an important role in the pathogenesis of renal disease. Since then several studies in human subjects and in experimental animals with diabetes have shown a correlation between serum lipids, renal lipids, and proteinuria and progressive decline in renal function (17Spencer M.W.

Our previous work has suggested that renal lipid accumulation associated with increased renal lipid synthesis is involved in the nephropathy seen in the type I diabetes animal model (20Sun L. Halaihel N. Zhang W. Rogers T. Levi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18919-18927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Whether a similar alteration in renal lipid metabolism and accumulation of lipids mediates the kidney disease associated with obesity-initiated metabolic syndrome, however, has not been established. In recent years the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) 2The abbreviations used are: SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding proteins; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; FAS, fatty acid synthase; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; LFD, low fat, 10 kcal % fat diet; HFD, high fat, 60 kcal % saturated (lard) fat diet; ECM, extracellular matrix; HMG, hydroxymethylglutaryl; ABCA1, ATP-binding cassette A-1; ACO, acetyl-CoA oxidase; PAS, periodic acid Schiff. have been shown to be master regulators of both fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism. Three SREBP isoforms, SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c, and SREBP-2, have been identified and characterized. SREBPs are synthesized as precursors bound to the endoplasmic reticulum. After a two-step cleavage process, the N-terminal segment of SREBP, also referred to as the mature (active) form, is released from the membrane and translocated into the nucleus, where it binds to enhancer regions of target genes to activate transcription. SREBP-1 preferentially activates genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, whereas SREBP-2 preferentially activates genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis (21Rawson R.B. Nat. Revs. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 22Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3838) Google Scholar). Although the role of SREBP in lipogenesis has been intensively examined in liver and adipose tissues (23Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Ikemoto S. Bashmakov Y. Hammer R.E. J. Biol.

Among the genetic and environmental factors associated with the development and maintenance of obesity, diet composition and caloric intake have been the focus of intense study (25Harte R.A.

The purposes of the present study are to examine in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity (a) whether there is altered renal lipid metabolism and renal accumulation of lipids, (b) whether those changes result in development of renal sclerosis and proteinuria, and (c) whether renal expression of SREBPs per se plays an important role in the pathogenesis of renal disease. Materials—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies against SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 were obtained from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Antibodies against plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against type IV collagen and fibronectin were obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Chemiluminescence detection reagents were obtained from Pierce. Animal Models—The first series of studies were performed with 8-week-old male C57BL/6J and A/J mice obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), representing differences in susceptibility to the effects of diet on body composition. They were housed in colony cages, maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle, and fed low fat, 10 kcal % fat diet (LFD) or high fat, 60 kcal % saturated (lard) fat diet (HFD) obtained from Research Diets, Inc. (New Brunswick, NJ) for 12 weeks. At the end of 12 weeks, mice were placed in metabolic balance cages for urine collection to measure albumin and creatinine. Eight mice in each experimental and dietary group were then anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital followed by blood draw for biochemical assays and kidney removal for RNA, protein, and lipid extraction. Another group of four mice in each experimental and dietary group were anesthetized and perfusion-fixed in vivo. The kidneys were then processed for periodic acid Schiff (PAS) and Oil Red O staining and immunofluorescence imaging. The second series of studies was performed in 12-week-old wild-type control and SREBP-1c–/– mice obtained from the Jackson Laboratory and inbred in our local animal care facility. The background of both wild-type control and SREBP-1c–/– mice is C57BL/6J;129S6/SvEv mixed. These mice were also housed in colony cages, maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle, and fed LFD or HFD for 4 weeks. These studies were approved by the Institutional Board of the Denver Veterans Affairs Medical System and the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center. All experimental procedures involving the production and use of laboratory mice complied with National Institutes of Health guidelines. Blood and Urine Chemistries—Plasma glucose was measured using the glucose CII kit (Wako Chemicals USA, Inc., Richmond, VA). Total plasma cholesterol was measured using the cholesterol CII kit (Wako). Total plasma triglycerides were measured by the L Type TG H kit (Wako). Plasma insulin was determined using a mouse insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (LINCO Research, Inc., St. Charles, MO). Free fatty acids were determined using the NEFA C kit (Wako). Urine albumin concentration was determined by using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay via the Albuwell M kit (Exocell, Philadelphia, PA). Urine creatinine concentration was determined by the Creatinine Companion kit (Exocell). Results are expressed as the urine albumin to creatinine ratio (milligrams/mg). Homogenization and Nuclei Isolation—Kidneys were homogenized at 4 °C in homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 75 mm NaCl, 2mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol), supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture consisting of 104 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride, 0.08 mm aprotinin, 2 mm leupeptin, 4 mm bestatin, 1.5 mm pepstatin A, and 1.4 mm E-64 (Sigma). Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Morooka et al. (31Morooka H. Bonventre J.V. Pombo C.M. Kyriakis J.M. Force T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30084-30092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) with modifications. An aliquot of homogenate was centrifuged at 3,300 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The nuclei were resuspended in a 0.5-packed nuclear volume of low salt buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). A 0.5-packed nuclear volume of high salt buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.8 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) was then added. After 30 min of continuous gentle mixing, the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (30 min at 25,000 × g). The supernatants were saved, and the protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Nuclear extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% w/v) as described by Laemmli (33Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% dried milk in TBST (0.2% Tween 20 in 1 × Tris-buffered saline), incubated with anti-SREBP-1 (1:1,000 dilution) and anti-SREBP-2 (1:1,000 dilution), followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000 dilution), washed four times with 1 × Tris-buffered saline, and then developed using a chemiluminescence detection system. The signals were quantified in a Fluor-S™ MultiImager (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Kidney homogenates were similarly subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then probed with antibodies for PAI-1 (1:1000 dilution) or VEGF (1:1000 dilution). RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from the kidneys using TRIzol from Invitrogen, and cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcript reagents from Bio-Rad Laboratories. The mRNA level was quantified using Bio-Rad iCyCler Real-time PCR system.

Perfusion Fixation of Kidneys—Mice were anesthetized and perfused with a fixative buffer that consisted of 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.05% picric acid, in a 6:4 mixture of cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4, adjusted to 300 mosmol with sucrose) and 10% hydroxyethyl starch. After 5 min of fixation, the mice were perfused for an additional 5 min with the cacodylate buffer (20Sun L. Halaihel N. Zhang W. Rogers T. Levi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18919-18927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). PAS Staining, Oil Red O Staining, and Immunofluorescence Imaging—Paraffin sections were stained for PAS. Frozen sections were used for Oil Red O staining to determine renal accumulation of neutral fats. The stained kidney sections were imaged with an Olympus microscope and scored semi-quantitatively in a blinded manner by the renal pathologist (M. S. L.). For immunofluorescence, frozen sections were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with 3% milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Triton X-100. They were then covered overnight at 4 °C with primary anti-mouse type IV collagen or fibronectin antibody diluted 1:200 in the preincubation solution. The sections were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline prior to incubation for 1 h at 4°C with the secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). After rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline the sections were mounted using DAKO-Glycergel™ (Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark) plus 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO, Sigma) as a fading retardant. The kidney sections were then imaged with a laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscope (Zeiss LSM 510, Jena, Germany). Data Analysis—Results are presented as the means ± S.E. for at least three independent experiments. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Keuls tests for multiple comparisons or by Student's t test for unpaired data. Statistical significance was accepted at the p < 0.05 level. HFD Causes Obesity, Hyperglycemia, and Hyperinsulinemia in C57BL/6J Mice but Not in A/J Mice—To study the effects of HFD on obesity, we fed C57BL/6J and A/J mice with LFD or HFD for 12 weeks and compared the changes in several relevant attributes of mice. As shown in TABLE TWO, the body weight and kidney weight of C57BL/6J mice with HFD were markedly increased as compared with those mice with LFD (p < 0.01). However, this diet-induced obesity was not observed in A/J mice. In addition, the plasma glucose and insulin levels were significantly higher in C57BL/6J mice with HFD than in those with LFD (p < 0.01). Again, A/J mice exhibited no diet-induced hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. The diet-induced changes in plasma triglyceride, cholesterol, and free fatty acid levels were not statistically significant in both C57BL/6J and A/J mice.TABLE TWOComparison of phenotype of A/J and C57BL/6J mice treated with LFD or HFDA/JC57BL/6JLFDHFDLFDHFDBody weight (g)27.80 ± 0.5432.32 ± 1.8031.10 ± 0.9347.89 ± 2.04ap < 0.01 versus C57BL/6J mice with LFD.Kidney weight (g)0.30 ± 0.020.33 ± 0.010.32 ± 0.020.40 ± 0.02ap < 0.01 versus C57BL/6J mice with LFD.Plasma glucose (mg/dl)110.83 ± 10.8126.67 ± 6.15131.50 ± 14.3215.67 ± 15.6ap < 0.01 versus C57BL/6J mice with LFD.Plasma triglycerides (mg/dl)79.15 ± 5.1182.21 ± 7.6684.76 ± 5.20105.19 ± 6.52Plasma cholesterol (mg/dl)127.85 ± 15.8297.47 ± 25.31156.96 ± 6.33222.78 ± 16.45Plasma insulin (ng/ml)0.35 ± 0.080.47 ± 0.040.41 ± 0.075.48 ± 0.40ap < 0.01 versus C57BL/6J mice with LFD.Plasma free fatty acid (mm)1.16 ± 0.110.86 ± 0.120.80 ± 0.060.88 ± 0.08a p < 0.01 versus C57BL/6J mice with LFD. Open table in a new tab HFD Causes Increased Renal Lipid Accumulation in C57BL/6J but Not in A/J Mice—To study whether HFD can cause an increase in renal lipid accumulation we performed Oil Red O staining in kidney sections, which revealed the accumulation of neutral lipids in the glomerular and tubulointerstitial cells of HFD-treated C57BL/6J mice (Fig. 1). There were significant increases in renal triglyceride and cholesterol content in C57BL/6J mice with HFD, which correlated well with the increased Oil Red O staining (Fig. 2). However, A/J mice fed a HFD had no increases in renal triglyceride and cholesterol content (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Triglyceride (A) and cholesterol (B) content in the kidney of LFD or HFD-fed A/J and C57BL/6J mice.

SREBPs are members of the basic helix-loop-helix zipper family of transcription factors that play a critical role in regulating fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. To become transcriptionally active, SREBPs are cleaved by proteases to release N-terminal segments, their mature and active forms, which can be transported into the nucleus. Immunoblotting of renal nuclei extracts revealed significant increases in SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 protein abundance in C57BL/6J mice with HFD compared with those mice with LFD (Fig. 3). In contrast, there were no significant differences in SREBP-1 or SREBP-2 nuclear protein abundance observed between A/J mice with LFD and HFD (Fig. 3). The increase in the renal expression of nuclear SREBP-1 was regulated at the transcriptional level as HFD caused significantly increased expression of SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c mRNA. SREBP-2 mRNA expression showed a trend toward an increase, but there was no statistical significance (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4The expression of SREBP-1a (A), SREBP-1c (B), and SREBP-2 (C) mRNA in the kidneys of C57BL/6J mice with LFD or HFD. Total RNA was isolated from the kidneys using TRIzol, and cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcript reagents. The mRNA level was quantified using Bio-Rad iCyCler Real-time PCR system. All the data were calculated from triplicate reactions. The C57BL/6J with HFD showed a statistically significant increase in the expression of SREBP-1a and 1c mRNA and showed a trend toward an increase in the expression of SREBP-2 mRNA. *, p < 0.05 versus C57BL/6J mice with LFD.

Compared with C57BL/6J mice with LFD, in those mice with HFD there were significant increases in ACC and FAS mRNA abundance (TABLE THREE), which suggests that fatty acid synthesis may be increased. Because increased renal triglyceride content could also be mediated via decreased fatty acid oxidation, we measured the mRNA level of acetyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), a key enzyme that mediates fatty acid oxidation. We found that ACO mRNA abundance trended to higher level in favor of fatty acid oxidation in C57BL/6J mice with HFD (TABLE THREE), suggesting that increased nuclear SREBP-1 abundance and potential up-regulation of fatty acid synthesis mediate the increased triglyceride accumulation in C57BL/6J mice with HFD (Fig. 2).TABLE THREEmRNA levels of enzymes involved in lipid metabolism in the kidneys of C57BL/6J mice with LFD or HFDLFDHFDFatty acid synthesisACC1.1 ± 0.14.7 ± 1.2ap < 0.05 versus C57BL/6J mice with LFD.FAS1.0 ± 0.17.2 ± 1.8ap < 0.05 versus C57BL/6J mice with LFD.Fatty acid oxidationACO7.7 ± 6.728.6 ± 3.7Cholesterol synthesisHMG-CoA Reductase1.4 ± 0.47.7 ± 2.5ap < 0.05 versus C57BL/6J mice with LFD.Cholesterol effluxABCA11.3 ± 0.42.8 ± 0.4ap < 0.05 versus C57BL/6J mice with LFD.ApoE1.4 ± 0.54.9 ± 2.5a p < 0.05 versus C57BL/6J mice with LFD.

To elucidate their mechanism of action and source of selectivity for bacterial membranes, phospholipid mixtures mimicking the compositions of natural bacterial membranes (containing anionic lipids) and mammalian membranes (containing zwitterionic lipids + cholesterol) were challenged with the peptides. We found that peptides readily inserted into bacterial lipid mixtures, although no insertion was detected in model “mammalian” membranes. The depth of peptide insertion into model bacterial membranes was estimated by Trp fluorescence quenching using doxyl groups variably positioned along the phospholipid acyl chains. Peptide antimicrobial activity generally increased with increasing depth of peptide insertion. The overall results, in conjunction with molecular modeling, support an initial electrostatic interaction step in which bacterial membranes attract and bind peptide dimers onto the bacterial surface, followed by the “sinking” of the hydrophobic core segment to a peptide sequence-dependent depth of ∼2.5–8 Å into the membrane, largely parallel to the membrane surface. Antimicrobial activity was likely enhanced by the fact that the peptide sequences contain AXXXA sequence motifs, which promote their dimerization, and possibly higher oligomerization, as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis and fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments. The high selectivity of these peptides for nonmammalian membranes, combined with their activity toward a wide spectrum of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and yeast, while retaining water solubility, represent significant advantages of this class of peptides.

Natural antimicrobial peptides are part of the innate immunity of a wide range of species ranging from insects and amphibians to mammals, including humans, defending against infections from bacteria, fungi, parasites, and enveloped viruses, with some peptides also effective against tumor cells (1Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6648) Google Scholar, 2Papo N. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6393-6403Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Currently, data bases report over 800 sequences for natural antimicrobial peptides and proteins from animals and plants (www.bbcm.univ.trieste.it), whereas several thousand others have been designed de novo and produced synthetically (3Shai Y. Biopolymers. 2002; 66: 236-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). Several classes of peptides have emerged including the following: (i) linear peptides free of cysteines and often with an amphipathic sequence (e.g. magainins); (ii) peptides with disulfide bonds that can produce a flat dimeric β-sheet structure (e.g. HBD-2); and (iii) peptides with an unusual bias toward certain amino acids, such as proline, arginine, tryptophan, or histidine (e.g. indolicidin) (4Boman H.G.

Many antimicrobial peptides are highly positively charged and exist predominantly as monomers with random coil structure in solution (8Oren Z. Shai Y. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar).

Lancet Infect. Dis. 2001; 1: 156-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar), and accordingly have the potential to form an amphipathic α-helical structure when bound to membranes.The increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance necessitates the development of new ways to combat bacterial infection. Although some antimicrobial peptides are already in clinical and commercial use, the future design of novel antimicrobial peptides will necessitate the optimization of multiple parameters, notably reduction of toxicity against eukaryotic cells and of susceptibility to proteolytic degradation. A key problem in clinical development of CAPs is the degree of selectivity between microbial and host cells. Peptides likely make this differentiation based on variations in the composition of each particular cell membrane (1Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6648) Google Scholar). Thus, for eukaryotic cells, the primary membrane features are the presence of cholesterol (up to 25%), predominance of phosphatidylcholine lipids, and an essentially neutral (zwitterionic) outer leaflet (10Verkleij A.J. Zwaal R.F. Roelofsen B. Comfurius P. Kastelijn D. van Deenen L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 323: 178-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). In contrast, bacterial cells lack cholesterol, have phosphatidylethanolamine as their most common zwitterionic lipid, but also contain 20–25% of negatively charged lipids in their outer membranes, including phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. Cationic antimicrobial peptides are active in the low medium micromolar range and show little target or l-versus d-residue specificity (their d-enantiomers exhibit similar activity to their l-counterparts), indicating that they interact with achiral components of the cell membrane (11Lee W.J.

Accordingly, bacteria may not easily develop resistance.Many cationic peptides studied to date have some toxicity, as measured by their tendency to induce lysis of erythrocytes at higher concentrations (e.g. gramicidins (13Prenner E.J.

Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23645-23648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), a class of novel synthetic 17-residue CAPs has been developed in our laboratory (26Stark M. Liu L.P. Deber C.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3585-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The latter series of peptides contain “guest” X residues embedded in an Ala-rich sequence, generally containing a Trp residue as fluorescent probe (TABLE ONE); several of these peptides have been studied previously in MIC and hemolysis assays (26Stark M. Liu L.P. Deber C.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3585-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Key features of the peptides are the consecutive nonamphipathic hydrophobic core of 11 residues, and the multipositively charged Lys/Arg in either segregated (all basic residues at the N or C terminus) or separated forms (basic residues at both termini). The Lys or Arg tags solubilize the hydrophobic peptides in aqueous media (25Liu L.P. Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23645-23648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 27Melnyk R.A. Partridge A.W. Deber C.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11106-11113Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Several of these peptides have been found to be highly effective against a series of Escherichia coli strains (MICs in the range of 4–128 μm or 8–256 μg/ml) (26Stark M. Liu L.P. Deber C.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3585-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and a wide variety of organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen in cystic fibrosis lung infections. In some instances, d-enantiomers of these sequences show somewhat higher activity versus their l-counterparts. Most of these same peptides display no hemolytic activity against rabbit or human red blood cells up to relatively high concentrations (325 μm or 650 μg/ml) (26Stark M. Liu L.P. Deber C.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3585-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, the detailed mechanism of their selective antimicrobial action has not been elucidated. Through studying this series of CAPs with a variety of biophysical techniques, including fluorescence and spin-labeling studies in phospholipid vesicles, we report here an assessment of the chemical/structural factors that are predominantly responsible for their high selectivity for nonmammalian membranes.TABLE ONESequences and designations of synthetic cationic antimicrobial peptides employed in the present work Lowercase letters in sequences indicate d-enantiomers of the amino acids.

Buffer was prepared using Tris sodium salt in doubly distilled water with adjustment to pH 7.0 by HCl.Peptide Synthesis—Peptides were synthesized by standard solid phase protocols using Fmoc chemistry on a PerSeptive Biosystems Pioneer peptide synthesizer as described (25Liu L.P. Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23645-23648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 26Stark M. Liu L.P. Deber C.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3585-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). A low load (>0.15 mmol/g) of peptide amide linker resin was used to incorporate an amide function at the peptide C terminus. O-(7-Azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate coupling reagent (0.45 m in DMF) and DIEA base (1.0 m in DMF) were used with a 4-fold excess of protected amino acids. Fluorescent probes (either dabcyl (4-dimethylaminophenylazobenzoyl) chloride (10 mg) or dansyl (N-(5-dimethylaminophthalene-1-sulfonyl) chloride (10 mg)) were coupled manually overnight after completion of solid phase synthesis using 100 mg of peptidyl-resin each in 1 ml of DMF with 50 μl of DIEA. Following a standard cleavage procedure (89% trifluoroacetic acid, 4.5% phenol, 4.5% triple distilled water, 2% triisopropylsilane), crude peptides were precipitated in cold ethyl ether. Deprotected peptides were purified on a reverse phase C18 high performance liquid chromatography column (Vydac, 250 × 21.5 mm) using a linear gradient of 20–30% B (Buffer A: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 95% triple distilled water, 5% AcCN; Buffer B: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 95% AcCN, 5% triple distilled water) for the first 10 min and then 30–50% B for another 30 min. Absorbance was monitored at 215 nm. Molecular masses were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry. Concentrations of peptides were determined in triplicate by standard BCA assay. Peptide solutions were stored at -20 °C.Circular Dichroism—Circular dichroism spectra were collected at different temperatures using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. Spectral scans were performed from 250 to 195 nm, with step resolution of 0.1 nm and bandwidth of 1.0 nm at speed 50 nm/min (28Liu L.P. Deber C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5476-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A 1-mm path length quartz cuvette was used for the measurements, and values from 7 scans were averaged per sample. Freshly prepared samples were measured at 20– 60 μm range. The aqueous buffer containing 10 mm buffer of Tris-HCl, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, was used as a solvent for measurements, and its background (in the presence of appropriate detergents where needed) was subtracted for each sample. 25 mm SDS solutions were generally prepared by dissolving the desired amount of reagents into this buffer. The molar ellipticity (29Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar) was calculated following Chen et al. (30Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1956) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 1, [θn]222=-39,500×(1-2.57/n)(Eq. 1) where n = number of residues.SDS-PAGE—Peptide samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, using NuPAGE pre-cast 12% BisTris gels (1.0 mm × 10 well) and buffers as follows: NuPAGE SDS sample buffer (NOVEX, San Diego, CA) and NuPAGE MES/SDS running buffer. Peptides were dissolved in different concentrations in sample buffer and heated at 85 °C for 10 min prior to electrophoretic separation at 125 mV. The values of Mr(exp):Mr(theor) ratios were calculated from each stained gel (either Coomassie Blue or Silver staining for peptides (10–140 μm) using See Blue and Mark12 markers and the NIH 1.62 Image Program, software available at www.cellbio.med.unc.edu/henson_mrm/pages/NIH.html) (31Choi M.Y. Cardarelli L. Therien A.G. Deber C.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8077-8083Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Preparation of Phospholipid Vesicles—The desired mixtures of phospholipids, cholesterol, and cardiolipin were dried in glass tubes first under nitrogen and then lyophilized overnight to obtain lipid films. The dry lipid films were then suspended for 1 h in a water bath at 40–50 °C in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0 (10 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl), and sealed with parafilm under nitrogen. The mixtures were vortexed occasionally to disperse the lipids. Vesicles were kept at 44 °C to maintain the lipids above the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition and used at the same day. The appropriate aliquots of the desired peptides were added.Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were prepared using standard procedure as described previously (28Liu L.P. Deber C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5476-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) but with no peptides present. Sonication of lipid dispersions was performed in 5-ml glass tubes in a bath-type sonicator (G112SP1G, Laboratory Supplies Co., Hicksville, NY) for 5 min in cold water (until clear). To avoid degradation of unsaturated lipids, sonication was performed at ∼10 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere.Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were prepared as described (29Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar) by freeze-thawing the desired lipid suspension five times under nitrogen to produce large multilamellar vesicles. The suspension was extruded 11 times through polycarbonate membranes with 0.1-mm diameter pores (Nuclepore Corp., Pleasanton, CA) on an Avanti mini-extruder apparatus.Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence emission spectra of peptide Trp residues were recorded on a Hitachi F-400 Photon Technology International C-60 fluorescence spectrometer equipped with water bath circulator for regulating the temperature. Semimicro quartz cuvettes of 0.5 ml (10-mm excitation path length and 4-mm emission path length) and 2 ml (10 × 10 mm, in titrations) (Hellma, Concord, Ontario, Canada) were used. Excitation wavelength was 280 nm, and emission spectra were recorded from 305 to 365 nm. Spectra were collected with a step size of 1 nm with an average of three cycles. Excitation and emission slit widths were 2 and 6 nm (2 and 6 nm band pass, 1 and 3 turns of the slit micrometers), respectively. All measurements were corrected for light scattering effects of vesicles by subtraction of background and by the correction function of the manufacturer's software. Background samples (blank suspensions of buffer or lipids in buffer) were prepared using the same protocol, except pure water instead of peptide solution was added. Blue shifts were calculated as the difference in wavelength of the maxima in emission spectra of lipid-peptide and aqueous peptide samples. Peptides were used in 1 or 4 mm of detergent, such that lipid-to-peptide ratios of either 250 or 1000 were established at a constant peptide concentration of 4 μm in all experiments except titrations. In the latter case, data were corrected for dilution of the peptides during the course of the experiment.For depth quenching measurements, 10% (mol %) of n-doxyl 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl (n-doxyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine into different types of vesicles was incorporated (32London E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 45: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The appropriate aliquots of the desired peptides were added to 1 mm of lipid vesicles in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0 (10 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl), 10 min prior to measurements. Each experiment was repeated at least twice, usually four times. The fluorescent intensities of the emission maxima were taken in the presence and in the absence of n-doxyl quenchers in vesicles. Parallax analysis was performed according to published procedures (33Chattopadhyay A.L.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The distance of the Trp residue from the bilayer center (ZCF) was calculated as shown in Equation 2, ZCF=LC5+(-ln(F5/F16)/πC-L5:162)/2(L5:16)(Eq. 2) where LC5 represents the distance from the bilayer center to the shallow placed n-doxyl quencher (n = 5), which is 10.8 Å for LUV-RBC(outer) and LUV-bact vesicles, and 9.9 Å for SUV-I and SUV-II vesicles (TABLE TWO); C is the mole fraction of quencher (0.1 in all cases) divided by the lipid area (70 Å) (34Voglino L. Simon S.A. McIntosh T.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7509-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); F5 and F16 are the relative fluorescence intensities of the shallower and deeper quenchers, respectively; and L5:16 is the difference in the depth of this two quenchers. For depth measurements, we used 0.9 Å per methylene group CH2. The indole ring insertion depth (d) was calculated as one-half the bilayer thickness (= 28.8 Å for SUV-I and SUV-II vesicles, or 30.6 Å for LUV-RBC(outer) and LUV-bact vesicles) minus ZCF.TABLE TWOMolar percentages of lipid composition and designations for vesicle preparations used in the present work Compositions for E. coli (minor components omitted) and erythrocyte membranes are as given by Gennis (54Gennis R.B. Cantor C.R. Biomembranes: Molecular Structure and Function. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1989: 1-35Crossref Google Scholar). SUV, small unilamellar vesicles; LUV, large unilamellar vesicles; bact, bacterial membrane composition; RBC, red blood cell membrane composition; RBC(outer), outer leaflet of RBC membrane composition; Zwit, zwitterionic.FRET Measurements—Labeling of peptides with dansyl (donor) and dabcyl (acceptor) was achieved by coupling of dansyl or dabcyl chlorides to the N-terminal Lys (35Melnyk R.A. Partridge A.W. Deber C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Steady-state fluorescent spectra were recorded on the Photon spectrometer. Samples were examined at constant stirring in a stoppered 10 ×10 mm disposable cuvette by removing and adding new portions of mixtures. Peptide stock solutions were diluted in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) with either 25 mm SDS detergent at room temperature or 1 mm of SUV-bact or SUV-RBC(outer) (TABLE TWO) at 44 °C. The concentration of dansyl-labeled peptides (donor) was kept constant at 1 μm, and the total concentration of dansyl-, dabcyl-, and unlabeled peptides was kept constant at 5 μm in SDS mixtures or at 0.5 and 2.5 μm in experiments with vesicles. Each mixture was allowed to equilibrate for 3 min. Emission spectra were collected from 450 to 650 nm at room temperature in SDS micelles and at 44 °C in SUV-bact. The λex = 341 nm, 0.5 s/nm, and band pass was 2 nm for excitation and 4 nm for emission. Each spectrum is the average of two or three runs.Computational Modeling—Energy-minimized models of the interaction between two idealized helices were produced using a global conformation search program CHI as described (36Adams P.D. Engelman D.M. Brunger A.T. Proteins. 1996; 26: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The program CHI identifies structures with energetically favorable packed interfaces between paired helices, analyzes all possible interactions, and returns sets of probable structures.RESULTSThe disruption mechanism of bacterial membranes by the present family of synthetic CAPs was examined in cell membrane mimic conditions by circular dichroism, fluorescence, and electrophoretic methods. The majority of these peptides (TABLE ONE) have average core values of +1.4 to 1.5 on the Liu-Deber scale (25Liu L.P. Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23645-23648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), which is above the threshold value of 0.4 for spontaneous cell membrane insertion. We also studied one significantly more hydrophobic peptide (All D W17-6K-(4L)), which possesses an average core hydropathy value of ∼3.1.Peptide Secondary Structure—TM Finder data analysis (37Deber C.M. Wang C. Liu L.P. Prior A.S. Agrawal S. Muskat B.L. Cuticchia A.J. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) predicts that in membrane-mimetic environments, segments of these CAPs will adopt an α-helical secondary structure. In case of Lys-segregated peptides (such as F17-6K), this segment is predicted to consist of residues 4–10 of the hydrophobic core, whereas for Lys-separated peptides (such as F17), residues 3–9 from the corresponding core are likely to be involved. Across this series, no more than seven residues (about 40% of total peptide residues) are predicted to be involved in formation of α-helix during membrane insertion. Circular dichroism data are consistent with these predictions. As typified by F17, the present CAP peptides are largely in random coil conformations in aqueous buffer (Fig. 1a). In SDS micelles, transition of the CD spectrum to a helical type pattern is observed; however, as derived from the experimental molar ellipticity values, only 5–8 residues are involved in helix formation in agreement with TM Finder analysis. No influence of concentration (20–60 μm), temperature (25–75 °C), or pH (in the range of 7–11) was found on the spectra in the case of F17 (not shown). Qualitatively similar effects were observed for the natural CAP magainin II (TABLE ONE and Fig. 1b), with the increased helical content in SDS micelles versus F17 arising from its greater length and longer helical segment(s). Similar to certain other CAPs (16Oren Z."
https://openalex.org/W2057560879,"Some compatible pathogens secrete toxins to induce host cell death and promote their growth. The toxin-induced cell death is a pathogen strategy for infection. To clarify the executioner of the toxin-induced cell death, we examined a fungal toxin (fumonisin B1 (FB1))-induced cell death of Arabidopsis plants. FB1-induced cell death was accompanied with disruption of vacuolar membrane followed by lesion formation. The features of FB1-induced cell death were completely abolished in the Arabidopsis vacuolar processing enzyme (VPE)-null mutant, which lacks all four VPE genes of the genome. Interestingly, an inhibitor of caspase-1 abolished FB1-induced lesion formation, as did a VPE inhibitor. The VPE-null mutant had no detectable activities of caspase-1 or VPE in the FB1-treated leaves, although wild-type leaves had the caspase-1 and VPE activities, both of which were inhibited by a caspase-1 inhibitor. γVPE is the most essential among the four VPE homologues for FB1-induced cell death in Arabidopsis leaves. Recombinant γVPE recognized a VPE substrate with Km = 30.3 μm and a caspase-1 substrate with Km = 44.2 μm, which is comparable with the values for mammalian caspase-1. The γVPE precursor was self-catalytically converted into the mature form exhibiting caspase-1 activity. These in vivo and in vitro analyses demonstrate that γVPE is the proteinase that exhibits a caspase-1 activity. We show that VPE exhibiting a caspase-1 activity is a key molecule in toxin-induced cell death. Our findings suggest that a susceptible response of toxin-induced cell death is caused by the VPE-mediated vacuolar mechanism similar to a resistance response of hypersensitive cell death (Hatsugai, N., Kuroyanagi, M., Yamada, K., Meshi, T., Tsuda, S., Kondo, M., Nishimura, M., and Hara-Nishimura, I. (2004) Science 305, 855–858). Some compatible pathogens secrete toxins to induce host cell death and promote their growth. The toxin-induced cell death is a pathogen strategy for infection.

Programmed cell death (PCD) 2The abbreviations used are: PCD, programmed cell death; VPE, vacuolar processing enzyme; E64-d, (l-3-trans-ethoxycarbonyloxirane-2-carbonyl)-l-leucine (3-methylbutyl) amide; FB1, fumonisin B1; MCA, α-4-metyl-coumaryl-7-amide; fmk, fluoromethylketone; mVPE, mature vacuolar processing enzyme; iVPE, intermediate vacuolar processing enzyme; proVPE, precursor of γVPE; AAL toxin, Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycoperisici toxin. is a basic physiological process that occurs under various stresses and during the development of animals and plants. Apoptosis, a type of PCD, is an essential mechanism for eliminating unwanted cells and involves DNA fragmentation, nuclear condensation, membrane blebbing, and cell shrinkage in animals (1Raff M. Nature. 1998; 396: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). The main executioners in apoptosis are caspases (aspartate-specific cysteine proteinases). Plant PCD often resembles animal apoptotic cell death with respect to some features such as DNA fragmentation and nuclear condensation (2Greenberg J.T. Yao N. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 3Danon A. Delorme V. Mailhac N. Gallois P. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 18: 647-655Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Extensive studies have shown that plant PCD is regulated by caspase-like activities (4Lam E. del Pozo O. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 44: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 5Lam E. Kato N. Lawton M. Nature. 2001; 411: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). However, no caspase homologue has been found in the Arabidopsis genome (6Uren A.G. Orourke K. Aravind L. Pisabarro T.M. Seshagiri S. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 961-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plants might use other proteinases that have caspase-like activity underlying the PCD. Identification of such proteinases is essential to elucidate the molecular mechanism that operates plant PCD and to provide some insights into differences between plant and animal PCDs. In oats (Avena sativa), serine proteinases exhibit caspase-like activities, and the activities increase during fungal toxin victorin-induced PCD (7Coffeen W.C. Wolpert T.J. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 857-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Homology searches reveal the existence of several meta-caspases in plants and fungi (6Uren A.G. Orourke K. Aravind L. Pisabarro T.M. Seshagiri S. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 961-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The silencing of a metacaspase gene reduced one caspase-like activities and abolished developmental cell death in Norway spruce (8Suarez M.F. Filonova L.H. Smertenko A. Savenkov E.I. Clapham D.H. von Arnold S. Zhivotovsky B. Bozhkov P.V. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 339-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These results imply that proteinases exhibiting caspase-like activities are involved in plant PCD. We recently showed that vacuolar processing enzyme (VPE) deficiency abolishes caspase-1 activity in virus-infected tobacco leaves (9Hatsugai N. Kuroyanagi M. Yamada K. Meshi T. Tsuda S. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Science. 2004; 305: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). VPE was originally found as a cysteine proteinase responsible for maturation of seed storage proteins (10Hara-Nishimura I. Inoue K. Nishimura M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). VPEs are involved in maturation and/or activation of not only various vacuolar proteins in plants (11Hara-Nishimura I.

Hara-Nishimura I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33194-33199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). VPE is synthesized as an inactive larger precursor and is self-catalytically converted into the mature form at acidic condition (pH 5.5) (17Hiraiwa N. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant J. 1997; 12: 819-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Kuroyanagi M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The C-terminal propeptide of Arabidopsis VPE functions as an autoinhibitory domain of the enzyme, and the self-catalytic removal of the C-terminal propeptide is required to generate an active enzyme (18Kuroyanagi M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The Arabidopsis genome has four VPE genes: αVPE, βVPE, γVPE, and δVPE (19Kinoshita T. Yamada K. Hiraiwa N. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant J. 1999; 19: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 20Gruis D.F. Selinger D.A. Curran J.M. Jung R. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2863-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These VPEs can be separated into two subfamilies: vegetative-type VPEs and seed-type VPEs. The vegetative αVPE and γVPE are induced during senescence, wounding, and pathogen infection and may play a role in the various types of cell death (19Kinoshita T. Yamada K. Hiraiwa N. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant J. 1999; 19: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 21Yamada K. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Planta. 2004; 218: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have found that VPE mediates virus-induced hypersensitive cell death (9Hatsugai N. Kuroyanagi M. Yamada K. Meshi T. Tsuda S. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Science. 2004; 305: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Hypersensitive cell death is accompanied by hypersensitive response and is caused by an interaction between plants and incompatible pathogens. On the other hand, some compatible pathogens secrete toxins to kill host cells and promote pathogen growth. A fungal pathogen, Fusarium moniliforme, causes serious disease symptoms in maize and some other grains. The host-selective mycotoxin fumonisin B1 (FB1) is produced by the pathogen. It has been shown that the toxin induces PCD in animal and plant cells (22Gilchrist D.G. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1998; 36: 393-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms of the toxin-induced cell death are unclear in plants. FB1, a sphinganine analogue, inhibits ceramide synthase (sphinganine N-acyltransferase), which is a key enzyme in sphingolipid biosynthesis (23Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sphingolipid synthesis pathway in yeast and animals is known to be a generator of a variety of signals involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis, including cell death (22Gilchrist D.G. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1998; 36: 393-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). It has not yet been clarified whether the signals produced by the sphingolipid synthesis are involved in plant cell death. FB1-induced cell death in Arabidopsis protoplasts is light-dependent and requires phytohormones, salicylate, and jasmonate- and ethylene-mediated signaling pathways (24Asai T. Stone J.M. Heard J.E. Kovtun Y. Yorgey P. Sheen J. Ausubel F.M. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1823-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). It seems that toxin-induced cell death is triggered by some complicated signaling pathways. Toxin-induced cell death is a pathogen strategy for infection, whereas hypersensitive cell death is a plant defense strategy against pathogen attack. The goal of this study was to determine what is an executioner of toxin-induced cell death. Here we report that VPE, which exhibits caspase-1 activity, is also involved in a fungal toxin-induced cell death in the same way that it is involved in cell death during hypersensitive response. Arabidopsis vpe Mutants—Four single vpe mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0) were used (supplemental Fig. 1A). All of αvpe-3 (Syngenta Biotechnology), γvpe-1 (14Shimada T.

Generation of a VPE-null (Quadruple) Mutant of Four VPE Genes— We generated a VPE-null mutant from four homozygous single vpe mutants of A. thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0); αvpe-3, βvpe-5, γvpe-1, and δvpe-1 (supplemental Fig. 1A). αvpe-3 was crossed with γvpe-1, and βvpe-5 was crossed with δvpe-1. We isolated two double mutants (αvpe-3 γvpe-1 and βvpe-5 δvpe-1) from F2 progeny by PCR-based genotyping. We crossed the double mutants with each other and isolated a VPE-null mutant (αvpe-3 βvpe-5 γvpe-1 δvpe-1). We used the primers for genotyping of γvpe-1 and δvpe-1 as described previously (Refs. 14Shimada T. Yamada K. Kataoka M. Nakaune S. Koumoto Y. Kuroyanagi M. Tabata S. Kato T. Shinozaki K. Seki M.

Kato T. Tabata S. Nishimura M. Nishimura I. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 876-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, respectively). The primers for the genotyping of αvpe-3 were used as follows: αVPE-HtRV, 5′-CGAAGCTTATGCCAGAAATGGACAA-3′, and LB3–1, 5′-TAGCATCTGAATTTCATAACCAATCTCG-3′. To identify the βvpe-5 genotype, we used the cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) method. A DNA fragment was amplified by PCR with the genome DNA and the following primers: βVPE-scrF, 5′-TTCTCGCTGCCATGGCTAAG-3′, and β5-CAPS, 5′-CACCATCTCTTACACGATAGAT-3′. The PCR product was digested with BsmAI. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from leaves with an RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen) and was treated with DNase. The RNA (0.5 μg) was subjected to reverse transcription with SuperScript II (Invitrogen) in a 20-μl reaction volume containing oligo(dT)12–18 primer (Invitrogen). The reaction (0.4 μl) was used for PCR in a 40-μl solution with TaKaRa Ex Taq polymerase (Takara). We used each primer set for γVPE (14Shimada T. Yamada K. Kataoka M. Nakaune S. Koumoto Y. Kuroyanagi M. Tabata S. Kato T. Shinozaki K. Seki M. Kobayashi M. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. J. Biol.

Plant. 2003; 15: 1159-1169Google Scholar). We also used each primer set as follows: αVPE (sense, 5′-TCTAGAATGACCACCGTCGTTTCCTTTCTCG-3′, and antisense, 5′-AGATCTTCAAGCACTGAATCCAC-3′), βVPE (sense, 5′-TCTAGAATGGCTAAGTCTTGCTATTTCAGAC-3′, and antisense, 5′-AGATCTTCAGGCGCTATAGCCTAAGAT-3′), and δVPE (sense, 5′-ATGTCTAGTCCTCTTGGTCA-3′, and antisense, 5′-GTTTTGCAAATCATTACATCGAACAAGCT-3′). PCR was run for 25 cycles with an annealing temperature of 55 °C (VPEs) or 60°C (ACT2). FB1 Treatment—Seeds were sown onto 0.4% agar that contained Murashige-Skoog medium and 1% sucrose and were grown at 22 °C under continuous light. Detached leaves from 5-week-old plants were infiltrated with FB1 (10 μm) in 0.1% methanol as an elicitor to trigger cell death. Methanol used as a solvent of FB1 caused little effect on the lesion formation (supplemental Fig. 1, B and C). The leaves were incubated at 22 °C under 12-h light/12-h dark condition to induce lesion formation as described elsewhere (27Stone J.M. Heard J.E. Asai T. Ausubel F.M. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1811-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Alternatively, for preparation of RNA, electron microscopy, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (supplemental Fig. 2), and cellular electrolyte leakage, we used leaves detached from 4-week-old plants. To examine the effects of proteinase inhibitors, we infiltrated a VPE inhibitor (Ac-ESEN-CHO, Peptide Institute) and a caspase-1 inhibitor (biotin-YVAD-fluoromethyl ketone (fmk), Calbiochem) into leaves together with FB1. Recombinant Arabidopsis γVPE—Sf21 insect cells expressing γVPE were prepared as described previously (18Kuroyanagi M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated on icefor 1 h in either a neutral solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to obtain the proprotein precursor of γVPE or an acidic solution (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to obtain both intermediate and mature forms of γVPE, as described previously (18Kuroyanagi M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We purified these forms of γVPE partially. Enzyme Assay—The recombinant γVPE (1.6–4.0 μg) was preincubated in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and 100 mm dithiothreitol before adding each fluorogenic substrate of Ac-ESEN-α-(4-metyl-coumaryl-7-amide) (MCA), Ac-ESED-MCA, Ac-YVAD-MCA, and Ac-DEVD-MCA (Peptide Institute). An increase of the fluorescence was measured at 460 nm with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (RF-5000, Shimadzu). Km values were determined by using a 80–400 μm concentration of each substrate. To determine the effects of various inhibitors, we used the recombinant γVPE and each inhibitor (20 μm): a VPE inhibitor (Ac-ESEN-CHO (Peptide Institute)), three caspase-1 inhibitors (biotin-XVAD-fmk and biotin-YVAD-chloromethylketone (Calbiochem) and Ac-YVAD-CHO (Peptide Institute)), a caspase-3 inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-CHO (Peptide Institute)), and a cysteine proteinase inhibitor (E64-d ((l-3-trans-ethoxycarbonyloxirane-2-carbonyl)-l-leucine (3-methylbutyl) amide) (Peptide Institute)). Each experiment was repeated three times, and the standard errors were obtained. We prepared the leaf extract in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μm E64-d and measured the VPE activity against benzyloxycarbonyl-AAN-MCA (1 mm, Peptide Institute) with a fluorescence microplate reader (GENios, TECAN). Each experiment was repeated three times, and the standard errors were obtained. Inhibitor Blot and Immunoblot—Sample solutions containing the recombinant γVPE were incubated with 20 μm biotin-XVAD-fmk. The resulting enzyme-inhibitor complex was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.22 μm, Nihon Millipore). The membrane was treated with a blocking solution and then with 20 μm streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. Detection was performed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL system, Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblot analysis was essentially as described previously (18Kuroyanagi M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—FB1-infiltrated leaves of wild-type and VPE-null mutant plants were vacuum-infiltrated for 1 h with a fixative, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon. Thin sections were stained with 4% uranyl acetate and lead citrate and were examined with a transmission electron microscope (model 1200EX, JEOL). Detection of Ion Leakage—Cellular electrolyte leakage was measured with an electrical conductivity meter (B-173, Horiba, Japan) as described elsewhere (28Kawai-Yamada M. Ohori Y. Uchimiya H. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis VPE Is Involved in FB1-induced Cell Death—FB1 is a fungal toxin produced by the plant pathogen F. moniliforme, which has been shown to induce PCD of the cells of Arabidopsis leaves (24Asai T. Stone J.M. Heard J.E. Kovtun Y. Yorgey P. Sheen J. Ausubel F.M. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1823-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 27Stone J.M. Heard J.E. Asai T. Ausubel F.M. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1811-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We treated Arabidopsis leaves of wild-type plants with FB1. A typical lesion showing cell death was formed on the leaves 5 days after FB1 infiltration (Fig. 1A, WT). To clarify whether VPEs are essential for the FB1-induced cell death, we generated an Arabidopsis mutant (VPE-null mutant) that lacks all four VPE genes (αvpe-3, βvpe-5, γvpe-1, δvpe-1) (supplemental Fig. 1A). There is no difference in development and growth between the VPE-null mutant plants and wild-type plants. No typical lesion was formed on the VPE-null mutant leaves 5 days after FB1 infiltration (Fig. 1A, null). The lesions on the wild-type leaves further developed from 5 to 7 days leading to cell death (Fig. 1B, WT). Interestingly, no lesions formed on the leaves of the VPE-null mutant plants even at 7 days after FB1 infiltration (Fig. 1B, null). Our results indicate that VPE is involved in FB1-induced cell death. VPE Deficiency Suppresses the Disruption of Vacuolar Membranes during FB1-induced Cell Death—Cell death after FB1 infiltration was monitored by measuring cellular electrolyte leakage. A significant ion leakage from the cells was found in the wild-type leaves at 3 and 5 days (Fig. 2G, WT), indicating that FB1-induced cell death started in the leaves. This was followed by typical lesion formation at 5 days. We examined the morphological changes in the cells of the leaves at 3 and 5 days after the FB1 infiltration. At 3 days, the vacuolar membranes were partially disrupted in the leaves and formed some membrane blebs (Fig. 2, A and B, red arrows), whereas the plasma membranes, cell walls, and other organelles remained ultrastructurally intact (Fig. 2, A and B). Normally, turgor pressure forces organelles close to the plasma membrane, but in the FB1-infiltrated leaves, the organelles were separated from the plasma membrane, indicating a loss of turgor pressure in the cells. At 5 days, the vacuolar membranes and plasma membranes were completely disrupted, and the other organelles were loosely distributed in the cell (Fig. 2C). In contrast to the wild-type leaves, the VPE-null-mutant leaves showed no ion leakage at 3 days or even 5 days after FB1 infiltration (Fig. 2G, null). In the null mutant leaves, vacuoles and vacuolar membranes remained intact at 3 days (data not shown), and even at 5 days after FB1 infiltration (Fig. 2D, blue arrows), and intact organelles were located close to the plasma membrane by turgor pressure (Fig. 2D). This was also the case in the untreated leaves of the wild-type and the null mutant plants (Fig. 2, E and F). These results indicate that VPE deficiency suppresses cell death by preventing the vacuoles from collapsing. Vacuolar membrane fragmentation that is triggered by VPE in toxin-induced cell death is supported by our previous results on fluorescent dye staining of protoplasts from virus-infected tobacco leaves (9Hatsugai N. Kuroyanagi M. Yamada K. Meshi T. Tsuda S. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Science. 2004; 305: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). FB1-induced cell death was accompanied by the DNA fragmentation (supplemental Fig. 2). This result suggested that VPE is involved in the DNA fragmentation into ∼50 kb by way of vacuolar disruption, leading to cell death. Toxin-induced cell death and hypersensitive cell death may share the VPE-mediated vacuolar mechanism. There is evidence that caspase-like activities are involved in various types of plant cell death, including the hypersensitive response (4Lam E. del Pozo O. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 44: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 29Woltering E.J. Trends Plant Sci. 2004; 9: 469-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To determine whether VPE and caspase-like activities are involved in the FB1-induced cell death in Arabidopsis plants in vivo, we infiltrated FB1 together with each proteinase inhibitor into the right halves of the leaves and examined the lesion formation on the leaves at 4 days after the infiltration. Significant lesions formed on the leaves treated with no proteinase inhibitor (Fig. 3A, left). A VPE inhibitor abolished completely such FB1-induced lesion formation on the leaves (Fig. 3A, middle). This is consistent with the result using the VPE-null mutant (Fig. 1). Similarly, a caspase-1 inhibitor abolished lesion formation (Fig. 3A, right). These results indicate that both VPE and caspase-1 activities are involved in the FB1-induced cell death. We recently showed that VPE has caspase-1 activity in tobacco mosaic virus-induced cell death in tobacco plants (9Hatsugai N. Kuroyanagi M. Yamada K. Meshi T. Tsuda S. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Science. 2004; 305: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). However, weak VPE and caspase-1 activities were detected in the VPE-silenced tobacco plants. To confirm that Arabidopsis VPE has caspase-1 activity, both VPE and caspase-1 activities were measured in the extracts from the FB1-treated leaves of the wild-type and VPE-null mutant. We found both activities in wild-type extracts (Fig. 3B), and the caspase-1 inhibitor reduced the VPE activity by 67% at a concentration of 10 μm and inhibited it completely at a concentration of 100 μm (Fig. 3B, left). The caspase-1 inhibitor also completely inhibited the caspase-1 activity at a concentration of 100 μm (Fig. 3B, right). Interestingly, neither VPE nor caspase-1 activity was detected at all in the VPE-null mutant (Fig. 3B). This result indicates that VPE is the proteinase that exhibits caspase-1 activity. γVPE Functions Primarily in FB1-induced Cell Death in Arabidopsis Leaves—To determine which VPE among the four VPE homologues is the most essential for toxin-induced cell death, we examined FB1-induced lesion formation on the leaves of each vpe single mutant. Three single mutants, αvpe-3, βvpe-5, and δvpe-1, formed lesions like those on the wild-type plant (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, the γvpe-1 mutant suppressed lesion formation (Fig. 4A). However, the suppression was not as strong as the VPE-null mutant plant. At 8 days after FB1 treatment, there was little difference in the lesion formation between the γvpe-1 mutant and wild-type plant (data not shown). γVPE deficiency may delay the lesion formation. We found the levels of ion leakage from the γvpe leaves at 3 and 5 days after FB1 infiltration were lower than those from the wild-type leaves and were higher than those from the VPE-null mutant leaves (Fig. 2G). The suppression level of lesion formation in γvpe leaves was higher than that of ion leakage. This result suggests that lesion formation needs a larger amount of VPE than ion leakage. It has been shown that VPE triggers vacuolar collapse (9Hatsugai N. Kuroyanagi M. Yamada K. Meshi T. Tsuda S. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Science. 2004; 305: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), and the vacuolar collapse directly causes ion leakage. On the other hand, lesion formation is caused indirectly by a vacuolar proteinase (VPE)-triggered vacuolar collapse. The lesion formation is visualized by chlorophyll degradation. The vacuolar collapse may release vacuolar hydrolytic enzymes, which cause degradation of chloroplasts and chlorophylls. These results indicate that cell death is delayed in the γvpe leaves and does not occur in the VPE-null mutant leaves. It is possible that the other VPEs partly compensate for the deficiency in γVPE in γvpe leaves (discussed below). γVPE mRNA was significantly induced in FB1-treated leaves of wild-type and three single vpe mutants (αvpe-3, βvpe-5, and δvpe-1) (Fig. 4B), which formed FB1-induced lesions (Fig. 4A). In contrast, γVPE mRNA was not induced in the treated leaves of γvpe-1 and VPE-null mutants (Fig. 4B), which did not form the lesions (Fig. 4A). This result suggests that lesion formation is coupled with γVPE gene expression in the FB1-treated leaves. γVPE mRNA increased rapidly at 1 day after FB1 infiltration in the leaves (Fig. 4B), and then the vacuoles in the leaves started to collapse around 3 days after FB1 infiltration (Fig. 2, A and B). The expression of γVPE preceded the vacuolar membrane disruption in the cells. Thus, γVPE primarily functions in FB1-induced cell death. Recombinant γVPE Exhibits a Caspase-1 Activity—To determine whether γVPE has caspase-1 activity, we expressed the precursor of γVPE in insect cells. The recombinant γVPE exhibited activities toward a caspase-1 substrate (Ac-YVAD-MCA, Km = 44.2 μm) and a VPE substrate (Ac-ESEN-MCA, Km = 30.3 μm) but not toward a caspase-3 substrate (Ac-DEVD-MCA) or a derivative of a VPE substrate (Ac-ESED-MCA), as summarized in Fig. 5A. The Km value for the caspase-1 substrate (44.2 μm) is comparable with the values reported for mammalian caspase-1 (11 and 23 μm) (30Talanian R.V. Quinlan C. Trautz S. Hackett M.C. Mankovich J.A.

Tomaselli K.J. Salvesen G.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10757-10765Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that VPE is a cysteine proteinase with a substrate specificity toward aspartic acids (32Hiraiwa N. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) similar to the substrate specificity of caspases (33Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; : 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2450) Google Scholar), although VPE is an asparaginyl endopeptidase (34Hara-Nishimura I. Barrett A.J. ings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, London1998: 746-749Google Scholar). We also found that VPE activity and caspase-1 activity were similarly reduced by both a VPE inhibitor (Ac-ESEN-CHO) and caspase-1 inhibitors (Ac-YVAD-CHO, biotin-XVAD-fmk, and biotin-YVAD-chloromethylketone) (Fig. 5B). This result suggests that the substrate pocket of VPE is similar to the Asp pocket of caspase-1. The Ki value of biotin-XVAD-fmk determined for the VPE substrate was 0.1 nm, and that for the caspase-1 substrate was 3.0 nm (Fig. 5A). These values are consistent with the Ki values reported for human and mouse caspase-1 (0.76 and 3.0 nm, respectively) (35Molineaux S.M. Casano F.J. Rolando A.M. Peterson E.P. Limjuco G. Chin Griffin P.R. Calaycay J.R. Ding G.J. Yamin T.T. Palyha O.C. Luell S. Flectcher D. Miller D.K. Howard A.D. Thornberry N.A. Kostura M.J. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1809-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). E64-d, a cysteine proteinase inhibitor, did not inhibit either VPE or caspase-1 activity (Fig. 5B). This result is consistent with the finding that caspases are insensitive to E64-d. As shown in Fig. 5C (upper panel), a precursor of γVPE (lane 1, proVPE) was self-catalytically converted into an intermediate form (lane 3, iVPE) and then into the mature form (lane 5, mVPE). To clarify whether each form of γVPE binds to biotin-XVAD-fmk, we subjected each of proVPE, iVPE, and mVPE to an inhibitor blot analysis. Both iVPE (Fig. 5C, lower panel, lane 10) and mVPE (Fig. 5C, lower panel, lane 12) bound to the inhibitor, whereas the proVPE (Fig. 5C, lower panel, lane 8) did not bind. This indicates that iVPE and mVPE have caspase-1 activity but proVPE does not. It has been shown that a procaspase-1 is self-catalytically converted into the mature enzyme (36Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4146) Google Scholar). Therefore, VPE has characteristics similar to those of caspase-1. Previously, we detected both VPE and caspase-1 activities in virus-infected tobacco leaves and found that the level of VPE activity completely paralleled that of the caspase-1 activity in each VPE gene-silenced plant (9Hatsugai N. Kuroyanagi M. Yamada K. Meshi T. Tsuda S. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Science. 2004; 305: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). This result suggested that VPE is responsible for caspase-1 activity. However, we were unable to prove that VPE is the only proteinase with capase-1 activity in plants because VPE gene expression was not completely suppressed in the VPE gene-silenced tobacco leaves. To overcome this difficulty in the current study we generated an Arabidopsis VPE-null mutant, which lacks all four VPE genes in the genome and used it to demonstrate in planta that VPE is responsible for caspase-1 activity. In addition, a recombinant VPE was found to have an enzymatic activity toward the caspase-1 substrate (Km = 44.2 μm), which is comparable with mammalian caspase-1. These are the first in vivo and in vitro demonstrations that VPE exhibits a caspase-1 activity similar to that of mammalian caspase-1. VPE resembles mammalian caspase-1 in other ways. The active site (EACE) of VPE is similar to that of human caspase-1 (QACR). Both enzymes are cysteine proteinases, and both are synthesized in a precursor form and then self-catalytically converted into the active enzymes (18Kuroyanagi M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 36Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4146) Google Scholar). Neither VPE nor mammalian caspase-1 is inhibited by the papain-type cysteine proteinase inhibitor E-64. The two enzymes also have some differences. First, the entire amino acid sequence of Arabidopsis γVPE exhibits a very low identity (21%) with that of human caspase-1 (36Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4146) Google Scholar, 37Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). Second, the optimum pH of VPE (5.5) is lower than that of human caspase-1 (7.5) (38Yamin T.T. Ayala J.M. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13273-13282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the different subcellular localizations of these enzymes: VPE is localized in vacuoles, which are acidic compartments (19Kinoshita T. Yamada K. Hiraiwa N. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant J. 1999; 19: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and caspase-1 is localized in the cytosol (38Yamin T.T. Ayala J.M. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13273-13282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). There are extensive studies showing that caspase-like activities are involved in plant PCD (4Lam E. del Pozo O. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 44: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 5Lam E. Kato N. Lawton M. Nature. 2001; 411: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). However, most caspase-1 activities in plants were very low compared with the caspase activities in mammals (39del Pozo O. Lam E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1129-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 40Rojo E. Martin R. Carter C. Zouhar J. Pan S. Plotnikova J. Jin H. Paneque Sanchez-Serrano J.J. Baker B. Ausubel F.M. Raikhel N.V. Curr. 2004; 14: 1897-1906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The low activities might have been the result of their being measured at neutral pH, which is used for mammal caspases. In this study, we measured the activities of both VPE and caspase-1 at pH 5.5 and obtained high levels of these activities. We reported previously that VPE with an acidic optimum pH exhibits little activity at neutral pH (18Kuroyanagi M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Considering that VPE is a proteinase exhibiting caspase-1 activity, the caspase-1 activity should be measured at acidic pH. The activities that were measured at neutral pH do not reflect the full activities in the cells. The acidic optimum pH of VPE is in agreement with the localization of VPE in vacuoles. This study and our previous study (9Hatsugai N. Kuroyanagi M. Yamada K. Meshi T. Tsuda S. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Science. 2004; 305: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) showed that VPE-mediated cell death induces vacuolar disruption. Vacuolar disruption has been shown to trigger degradation of the cytoplasmic structures during the differentiation of tracheary elements, leading to cell death (41Jones A.M. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The vacuolar disruption-triggered cell death is unique to plants and has not been seen in animal cell death (42Lam E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Our findings show that VPE is a key molecule in the molecular mechanism underlying plant-specific cell death. FB1 is a competitive inhibitor of ceramide synthase, which is responsible for sphingolipid biosynthesis (22Gilchrist D.G. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1998; 36: 393-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and induces plant PCD through a process of disruption of sphingolipid biosynthesis, although the molecular mechanism is unclear. Sphingolipid is abundant in vacuolar membranes (43Tavernier E. Le Quoc D. Le Quoc K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; : 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It is possible that abolishing ceramide synthesis causes the loss of integrity of the vacuolar membrane. Therefore, modulation of the lipid composition of vacuolar membranes might lead to VPE-triggered vacuole collapse. The fungus Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycoperisici produces AAL-toxin, a chemical congener of FB1 (44Nelson P.E. Daajardlns A.E. Plattner R.D. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1993; : 233-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). AAL-toxin was shown to induce PCD in tomato plants (45Wang H. Li J. Bostock R.M. Gilchrist D.G.

We found that the recombinant p35 inhibited VPE activity in vitro. 3M. Kuroyanagi and I. Hara-Nishimura, unpublished data. AAL-toxin-induced cell death might be mediated by VPE, as is the case with FB1-induced cell death. This suggests that VPE is involved commonly in fungal toxin-induced cell death in plants. Toxin-induced cell death is a necrotrophic pathogen strategy for infection, whereas hypersensitive cell death is a plant defense strategy against pathogen attack. Apparently these processes are different from each other. However, our results show that toxin-induced cell death as a pathogen strategy (this study) and the hypersensitive cell death as a plant defense strategy (9Hatsugai N. Kuroyanagi M. Yamada K. Meshi T. Tsuda S. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Science. 2004; 305: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) are both mediated by VPE. The expression patterns of the VPE genes in different plant tissues (19Kinoshita T. Yamada K. Hiraiwa N. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I.

Planta. 2004; 218: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) suggest that VPE is involved in various types of plant cell death. We recently found that Arabidopsis δVPE, which exhibits caspase-1 activity, is involved in the cell death of two cell layers during embryogenesis, the purpose of which is to form a seed coat (25Nakaune S. Yamada K. Kondo M. Kato T. Tabata S. Nishimura M. Nishimura I. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 876-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The developmental cell death, as well as pathogen-induced cell death, is regulated by VPE. The results suggest that the VPE-mediated cell death system is a common machinery of plant cell death. A reverse genetic analysis is a powerful way to elucidate how VPE functions in cell death. However, it should be noted that a single γvpe mutant exhibits a weak and leaky phenotype on cell death. Neither lesion formation (Fig. 4) nor ion leakage (Fig. 2G) was suppressed in the γvpe leaves as strongly as in the VPE-null mutant. Also, a γvpe single mutant exhibited no difference from wild-type plants in lesion formation on Pseudomonas syringae-infected leaves, despite some differences in bacterial growth (40Rojo E. Martin R. Carter C. Zouhar J. Pan S. Plotnikova J. Jin H. Paneque Sanchez-Serrano J.J. Baker B. Ausubel F.M. Raikhel N.V.

Previously, we reported that αVPE and γVPE compensate for the lack of βVPE in βvpe mutant (14Shimada T. Yamada K. Kataoka M. Nakaune S. Koumoto Y. Kuroyanagi M. Tabata S. Kato T. Shinozaki K. Seki M.

In this study, we used a more subtle N-linked glycosylation scanning approach, which allowed us to assess the topology of functional PS1 molecules. Glycosylation acceptor sequences were introduced into full-length human PS1, and the results showed that the first hydrophilic loop is oriented toward the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas the N terminus and large hydrophilic loop are in the cytosol. Although this is in accordance with most current models, our data unexpectedly revealed that the C terminus localized to the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum. Additional studies on the glycosylation pattern after TM domain deletions, combined with computer-based TM protein topology predictions and biotinylation assays of different PS1 mutants, led us to conclude that PS1 has nine TM domains and that the C terminus locates to the lumen/extracellular space.

PS1 is a TM protein of ∼50 kDa with 10 HDs that could all theoretically span the membrane.

The currently favored model suggests an eight-TM domain topology, positioning the N and C termini, as well as the large hydrophilic loop in the cytosol (15Doan A. Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R.

Because PS is proposed to carry the catalytic site of the γ-secretase complex, clarifying the topology of the protein is a crucial step in understanding the molecular mechanism of γ-secretase activity: assessment of PS conformation and thereby the orientation of the catalytic Asp-257 and Asp-385 residues is critical for explaining how the protein functions as an enzyme. Here we analyzed the topology of PS1 by introducing glycosylation acceptor sequences into human PS1. In agreement with the majority of previous studies on PS topology, we found that the first hydrophilic loop had a luminal orientation whereas the N terminus and large hydrophilic loop were in the cytosol. In contrast, our data suggested that the C terminus was located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These findings, corroborated by computer-based TM topology predictions and biotinylation assays of different PS1 mutants led us to propose a novel nine-TM domain model for PS1.

All transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine Plus according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). BD8 cells stably expressing PS1_K395E or PS1_K395E,Q464K were generated by transfection of BD8 cells with pCAG-PS1_K395E-IRES-Puro or pCAG-PS1_K395E,Q464K-IRES-Puro, followed by culture in medium supplemented with puromycin (1 μg/ml) for 1 week. Single puromycin-resistant colonies were expanded and analyzed for PS expression. Endoglycosidase H Treatment—Cells transiently transfected in 6-well tissue culture plates were harvested 24 h post-transfection and resuspended in 0.4 ml of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cells were passed through a 20-gauge needle 20 times and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min. Postnuclear supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 15 min. Pellets were resuspended in a buffer composed of 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 125 mm sucrose, 100 mm sodium citrate, 100 mm NaCl, 5mm KCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.75 mm MgCl2, 0.3% SDS, 0.6% β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science). Endoglycosidase H (Roche Applied Science) was added when indicated (1 μl per 25-μl sample), and deglycosylations were performed in 37 °C for 2 h. Luciferase-based Reporter Assays—Transfections for the luciferase-based reporter assays were carried out in 24-well tissue culture plates essentially as described (23Laudon H. Mathews P.M. Karlström H. Bergman A. Farmery M.R. Nixon R.A. Winblad B. Gandy S.E. Lendahl U. Lundkvist J. Näslund J. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Where indicated, the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT was added (1 μm) to the transfected cells. Cells were lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer per well (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.65% Nonidet P-40), and luciferase activity was monitored luminometrically after addition of luciferin (BioThema) and ATP (BioThema). The β-galactosidase activities of the cell lysates were determined to equalize for differences in transfection efficiencies. Arbitrary β-galactosidase normalized luminescence units are presented as percent activity compared with wild type PS1 response. Co-immunoprecipitations—Transfections were carried out in a 6-well format on cells cultured to near confluency. Co-immunoprecipitations were performed on lysates 48 h post transfection. Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml co-immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 1% CHAPSO) and briefly sonicated. Lysates were subjected to ultracentrifugation (100 000 × g, 20 min). The CHAPSO-soluble supernatant was pre-cleared with a mixture of protein A- and G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The pre-cleared supernatants were incubated with primary antibody (dilution 1:300) overnight, and proteins were pulled down with a mixture of protein A- and G-Sepharose. Pre-immune serum was used as negative control. Biotinylation and Streptavidin Precipitation of Cell Surface Proteins— Cultures of BD8 cells and BD8 cells stably expressing PS1, PS1_K395E, or PS1_K395E,Q464K were biotinylated as described previously (24Hansson E.M. Strömberg K. Bergstedt S. Yu G. Näslund J. Lundkvist J. Lendahl U. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 1010-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in whole cell extract buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.42 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science). To break protein-protein interactions, SDS was added to a final concentration of 2%, and the samples were heated at 55 °C for 5 min. Radioimmune precipitation assay buffer was subsequently added to dilute the SDS concentration to 0.4%, and biotinylated proteins were precipitated using streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce). Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitated proteins and proteins from cell lysates were resolved on 10–20% Tricine gels (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and detected by appropriate antibodies. The immunoblots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and ECL substrate (Pierce). Antibodies—The antibodies used for co-immunoprecipitations of PS1 were polyclonal antibody Ab14, raised against the N terminus of PS1 (25Seeger M. Nordstedt C. Petanceska S. Kovacs D.M. Gouras G.K.

For immunoblotting of PS1, monoclonal antibody NT1 directed toward the N terminus (26Mathews P.M. Cataldo A.M. Kao B.H. Rudnicki A.G. Qin X. Yang J.L. Jiang Y. Picciano M. Hulette C. Lippa C.F.

Nicastrin was immunoprecipitated and detected using polyclonal antibody N1660 (Sigma). Polyclonal antibody UD1 was used for immunoblotting of Pen-2 (27Bergman A. Hansson E.M. Pursglove S.E.

Monoclonal anti-Myc, clone 4A6 (Upstate) was used to detect epitope-tagged Notch constructs. A monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma) was used for immunoblotting. Glycosylation Acceptor Site Assay Defines a Luminal Localization for the C Terminus of PS1—To determine the topology of PS1, glycosylation acceptor sites (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr; where Xaa can be any amino acid except proline) were introduced into PS1 in different positions as shown in Fig. 1A. The glycosylation acceptor site assay for topology studies is based on the Asn residue of the sequence Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr being glycosylated in the luminal compartment of ER, by transfer of high mannose oligosaccharides in an enzymatic reaction catalyzed by oligosaccharyltransferase (28Welply J.K. Shenbagamurthi P. Lennarz W.J. Naider F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11856-11863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, glycosylation acceptor sites in TM proteins become glycosylated if they face the lumen but not if they are located in the membrane or the cytosol. To avoid interference from endogenous PS, we introduced the different constructs into BD8 cells, in which the PS1 and PS2 genes have been ablated (22Donoviel D.B. Hadjantonakis A.-K. Ikeda M. Zheng H. St George-Hyslop P. Bernstein A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2801-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Glycosylation patterns for the transiently expressed constructs were assessed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). The introduction of a glycosylation acceptor site in the first hydrophilic loop situated between HD 1 and HD 2 (construct PS1_HL1) resulted in a shift in migration for both the full-length protein and the NTF (Fig. 1B, lane 5). Endoglycosidase H treatment reduced the size of the protein, confirming that the shift was caused by glycosylation (Fig. 1B, lane 6), and indicating that the first loop had a luminal/extracellular orientation. In contrast, the constructs with a glycosylation acceptor site in the N-terminal tail of PS, preceding HD1 (construct PS1_N), or in the large hydrophilic loop between HD 7 and HD 8 (PS1_large HL) were not glycosylated in the ER lumen (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–4 and 7–8, respectively). This indicates that the N terminus and the large hydrophilic loop face the cytosol, which is in agreement with most current topological models (15Doan A. Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Slunt H.H.

Similarly, no glycosylation was detected when a glycosylation acceptor site was introduced into HD 10 of PS1, which is generally believed to be in the cytosol (construct PS1_HD10, Fig. 1B, lanes 9 and 10). Interestingly, the construct with the glycosylation acceptor site in the absolute C terminus (PS1_C) was partially glycosylated, indicating that the C-terminal was located in the lumen (Fig. 1B, lane 11). Deglycosylation by treatment with endoglycosidase H resulted in disappearance of the upper band, confirming that the shift was caused by a glycosylation (Fig. 1B, lane 12). Taken together, the glycosylation patterns for PS1_HD10 and PS1_C suggest that HD 10 spans the membrane and positions the C terminus in the lumen, at least in a subset of PS1 molecules. Glycosylation Acceptor Site Mutants Form Functional γ-Secretase Complexes—Compared with the use of other reporter domains, glycosylation acceptor sites represent a less invasive topology tracing technique, but we wanted to assure that the introduction of the glycosylation acceptor sites did not affect the functionality of the engineered PS1 molecules. We therefore analyzed the mutants for γ-secretase activity using a previously described luciferase-based γ-secretase reporter assay (18Karlström H. Bergman A. Lendahl U. Näslund J. Lundkvist J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6763-6766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 19Taniguchi Y. Karlström H. Lundkvist J. Mizutani T. Otaka A. Vestling M. Bernstein A. Donoviel D.

Intramembrane cleavage of C99-GVP, a protein mimicking β-secretase-processed APP with an intracellular Gal4/VP16 domain (18Karlström H. Bergman A. Lendahl U. Näslund J. Lundkvist J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6763-6766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), was monitored by UAS-luciferase activation in BD8 cells transiently transfected with the different glycosylation acceptor site mutants. The mutants were all functional in this assay, although PS1_HL1 and to some extent also PS1_HD10 and PS1_C had reduced γ-secretase activity compared with wild type PS1 (Fig. 1C, upper panel). Expression of the different PS1 mutants was verified by immunoblotting using an antibody directed toward PS1 NTF (Fig. 1C, middle panel). Interestingly, the full-length form of PS1_HD10 appeared to have reduced stability. However, the amount and stability of NTF generated from PS1_HD10 seemed to be unaffected, which indicated that the mutant had a native conformation. To corroborate the results from the luciferase-based APP reporter assay, we examined the ability of the PS glycosylation acceptor site constructs to mediate γ-secretase cleavage of another target protein: the Notch receptor. We transiently transfected BD8 cells with Notch ΔE, a membrane-tethered, N-terminally truncated Notch 1 receptor that is constitutively cleaved by γ-secretase (20Kopan R. Schroeter E.H. Weintraub H. Nye J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), together with the different PS constructs. Western blotting revealed that all PS constructs were able to generate a fragment corresponding to the Notch intracellular domain (Notch ICD) through γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of Notch ΔE (Fig. 1C, lower panels). However, the PS1_HL1 construct exhibited considerably lower activity, such that Notch ICD could only be detected after a long exposure of the film (Fig. 1C). To confirm that the results obtained with PS1_HL1 in the luciferase assay was due to γ-secretase activity, we treated transfected cells with the specific γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT (Fig. 1D). DAPT blocked activation of the reporter system, lending support to the notion that PS1_HL1 can form functional γ-secretase complexes. To verify that the introduction of the glycosylation sites did not interfere with correct complex assembly, co-immunoprecipitations using an antibody toward nicastrin were performed under conditions shown to keep the complex intact (32Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6138-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1E). All glycosylation acceptor site mutants were co-immunoprecipitated with nicastrin, as shown by immunoblotting with antibodies toward PS1 NTF and CTF (Fig. 1E). Importantly, PS1_HL1, PS1_HD10, and PS1_C, which had reduced γ-secretase activity co-precipitated with nicastrin (Fig. 1E, lanes 4, 6, and 7). Moreover, an antibody directed toward PS1 CTF co-precipitated PS1 NTF, and an antibody specific for the N terminus of PS1 co-precipitated Pen-2 for all constructs (data not shown). Taken together, this suggests that the constructs adopted a native conformation. However, the CTF of PS1_C that was immunoprecipitated with nicastrin was apparently not glycosylated (Fig. 1E, lane 7). In fact, although the full-length PS1_C construct was glycosylated we could not detect any glycosylated CTF generated from PS1_C in either cell lysates or upon co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1E, lane 7). To be efficiently glycosylated a glycosylation acceptor site must not be located too close to the protein's C terminus (33Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17338-17343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, the most parsimonious explanation for the partial glycosylation of PS1_C is a suboptimal position of the glycosylation acceptor site. An alternative explanation for the appearance of a double band could be the presence of a mixture of PS1 molecules, with different topological orientations. To resolve this issue, we optimized the C-terminal glycosylation acceptor site to achieve a more complete glycosylation of PS1, and to permit detection of glycosylated species of CTF. The best result was obtained when the glycosylation acceptor site was inserted between the glutamine residue in position 464 and the phenylalanine in position 465 (construct PS1_optC, Fig. 2A). Upon expression in PS-deficient cells, PS1_optC appeared to be fully glycosylated, and glycosylation of both full-length PS1 and PS1 CTF was confirmed by endoglycosidase H treatment (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). The functionality of the mutant was analyzed with the γ-secretase reporter assay as well as by analyzing the conversion of Notch ΔE to Notch ICD (Fig. 2C). PS1_optC restored γ-secretase activity to almost the same extent as wild type PS1. Importantly, Western blot analysis showed that all CTF derived by endoproteolysis of PS1_optC was glycosylated, implying that PS molecules with a luminal orientation of the C-terminal tail can form γ-secretase complexes. To further analyze the functionality of CTFs with a luminal C-terminal tail, we performed co-immunoprecipitations under γ-secretase-preserving conditions. We showed that glycosylated CTF generated from PS1_optC interacted with nicastrin in transiently transfected cells (Fig. 2D). In all cases, no non-glycosylated CTF derived from PS1_opt was seen (Fig. 2, C and D). Collectively, our data obtained with the PS1_optC construct strongly support the notion that functional PS1 can adopt a membrane topology in which the C terminus of the protein faces the luminal space.

https://openalex.org/W2144780574,"Bone homeostasis depends on the coordination of osteoclastic bone resorption and osteoblastic bone formation. Receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) induces osteoclast differentiation through activating a transcriptional program mediated by the key transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) c1. Immunoreceptors, including osteoclast-associated receptor (OSCAR) and triggering receptor expressed by myeloid cells (TREM)-2, constitute the co-stimulatory signals required for RANKL-mediated activation of calcium signaling, which leads to the activation of NFATc1. However, it remains unknown whether the expression of immunoreceptors are under the control of NFATc1. Here we demonstrate that the expression of OSCAR, but not that of TREM-2, is up-regulated during osteoclastogenesis and markedly suppressed by the calcineurin inhibitor FK506, suggesting that OSCAR is transcriptionally regulated by NFATc1. NFATc1 expression results in the activation of the OSCAR promoter, which was found to be further enhanced by co-expression of PU.1 and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). We further provide evidence that NFATc1 specifically regulates OSCAR by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and quantification of OSCAR and TREM-2 mRNA in NFATc1-/- cells. Thus, OSCAR but not TREM-2 is involved in the positive feedback loop of the immunoreceptor-NFATc1 pathway during osteoclastogenesis. Although several immunoreceptors have been identified as co-stimulatory molecules for RANKL, the expression and function are differentially regulated. These mechanisms, possibly together with the delicate regulation of their ligands on osteoblasts, may provide the exquisite machinery for the modulation of osteoclastogenesis in the maintenance of bone homeostasis.

Bone is continuously remodeled by a series of cellular actions of bone-resorbing osteoclasts and bone-forming osteoblasts. Osteoclasts are the primary cells that resorb bone, and our knowledge concerning the mechanisms of osteoclast differentiation has been increasing rapidly (1Karsenty G. Wagner E.F. Dev.

Receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) are provided by osteoblasts and essential for osteoclastogenesis (1Karsenty G. Wagner E.F. Dev.

In addition, we discovered recently that the immunoreceptor-mediated calcium signals are also critical for osteoclastogenesis (6Koga T. Inui M. Inoue K. Kim S. Suematsu A. Kobayashi E. Iwata T. Ohnishi H. Matozaki T. Kodama T. Taniguchi T. Takayanagi H. Takai T. Nature. 2004; 428: 758-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). In the osteoclast differentiation program, transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) c1 is induced significantly by RANKL (7Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M.

NFATc1 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of osteoclast-specific genes, such as ACP5 (encoding tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)) (7Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H.

Moreover, NFATc1-deficient embryonic stem cells failed to differentiate into osteoclasts in vitro, and ectopic expression of NFATc1 caused induction of osteoclast differentiation even in the absence of RANKL (7Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M. Yoshida H. Saiura A. Isobe M. Yokochi T. Inoue J. Wagner E.F. Mak T.W. Kodama T. Taniguchi T. Dev.

The activity of NFATc1 is controlled by the phosphatase calcineurin, which plays a critical role in the coupling of calcium signals with cellular responses (10Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 11Crabtree G.R. Olson E.N.

Once activated by an increase of the intracellular calcium concentration, calcineurin induces the translocation of NFATc1 into the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of specific target genes. RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and NFATc1 induction are strongly inhibited by the calcineurin inhibitor FK506, and this shows the importance of calcium signaling during osteoclast differentiation (7Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M. Yoshida H. Saiura A. Isobe M. Yokochi T. Inoue J. Wagner E.F. Mak T.W. Kodama T. Taniguchi T. Dev.

However, it is not likely that RANKL, whose receptor RANK belongs to the tumor necrosis family receptor family (14Wong B.R. Rho J. Arron J. Robinson E. Orlinick J. Chao M. Kalachikov S. Cayani E.

Thus we focused on the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), which is necessary for the transduction of the calcium signal in immune cells (16Lanier L.L. Corliss B.C. Wu J. Leong C. Phillips J.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 17Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3281-3285PubMed Google Scholar), and found that ITAM-mediated calcium signaling is also indispensable to osteoclastogenesis (6Koga T. Inui M. Inoue K. Kim S. Suematsu A.

ITAMs are present in the cytoplasmic domains of several transmembrane adaptor molecules, including FcRγ (Fc receptor common γ subunit) and DAP12 (DNAX-activating protein 12), and serve as signal transducers for immunoreceptors (18Horejsi V.

We and others have reported that the combined deficiency of DAP12 and FcRγ in mice results in severe osteopetrosis, and the osteoclast precursor cells derived from these mice do not differentiate into osteoclasts in vitro (6Koga T.

Matozaki T. Kodama T. Taniguchi T. Takayanagi H. Takai T. Nature. 2004; 428: 758-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Importantly, these immunoreceptors activate calcium signals essential for the activation of NFATc1 (6Koga T. Inui M. Inoue K. Kim S. Suematsu A. Kobayashi E. Iwata T. Ohnishi H. Matozaki T. Kodama T. Taniguchi T. Takayanagi H. Takai T. Nature. 2004; 428: 758-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). However, little is known about how these receptors are regulated during osteoclastogenesis and whether they are conversely regulated by NFATc1. In this report, we focused on OSCAR and TREM-2, which are representative receptors associated with FcRγ and DAP12, respectively, and investigated the transcriptional regulation of OSCAR and TREM-2 by NFATc1. Using reporter gene assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we showed that NFATc1 selectively activates the OSCAR promoter. Marked inhibition of the RANKL-induced OSCAR expression in NFATc1-/- cells clearly demonstrates the importance of NFATc1 in the transcriptional control of OSCAR in osteoclast differentiation, which will be discussed in the context of positive feedback regulation of osteoclastogenic signaling.

Briefly, mouse bone marrow cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) containing 10 ng ml-1 M-CSF (Genzyme).

NFATc1+/- and NFATc1-/- mouse fetal liver cells derived from E13.5 embryos were obtained by crossing NFATc1+/- parental mice and were cultured in the same way as the bone marrow cells described above. Co-culture of osteoblasts derived from mouse calvaria cells and bone marrow cells was performed in the presence of 10-8m 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 (Wako) and 10-6m prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (Wako) (5Takahashi N.

TRAP-positive multinucleated cells, which have more than three nuclei, were counted. Generation of Fc Fusion Proteins—DNA fragments encoding the extracellular domains of OSCAR and TREM-2 were amplified by Fast-Start High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Applied Science) using cDNA of RANKL-stimulated mouse BMMs as a template. The following sense and antisense primers were used for PCR: OSCAR, 5′-AGCTTAGTGCCCACCATGGTCCTGT-3′ (sense), 5′-CTCGAGGTTTCCCTGGGTATAGTCCA-3′ (antisense); TREM-2, 5′-AAGCTTGAAAGGTGCCATGGGACCTC-3′ (sense), 5′-CTCGAGGGAGGTGGGTGGGAAGGAGG-3′ (antisense). The sequence of the amplified fragments was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Then the fragments were fused to the cDNA corresponding to the Fc portion of human IgG1a (kindly provided by L. L. Lanier) and inserted into the HindIII/XhoI site of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). After transient transfection into COS7 cells with the plasmids, culture supernatants were collected and affinity-purified with the MAbTrap Kit (Amersham Biosciences). Purified Fc fusion proteins were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and separated with SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-human IgG antibody (Serotec). The same membranes were stripped and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-mouse OSCAR (G-T Research) or anti-mouse TREM-2 (R&D Systems) antibodies, respectively. For analysis of glycosylation, precipitates were treated overnight with N-glycopeptidase F (Wako) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Flow Cytometric Analysis with Fc Fusion Proteins—Single cell suspensions of osteoblasts, obtained by detaching cells with cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen), were preincubated with anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (Fcγ receptor) monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences) for 15 min on ice to block nonspecific staining. Cells were then mixed with a saturating concentration of Fc fusion proteins or control human IgG (BD Biosciences) for 30 min, followed by incubation with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human IgG (BD Biosciences) for 15 min on ice. Stained cells were analyzed by FACScan using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). RNA Isolation and Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using Sepasol (Nacalai Tesque) from cultured cells. 1 μg of RNA was treated with DNase I and reverse-transcribed with the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The following sense and antisense primers were used for mouse OSCAR, TREM-2, and GAPDH: OSCAR, 5′-TGGCGGTTTGCACTCTTCA-3′ (sense), 5′-GATCCGTTACCAGCAGTTCCAGA-3′ (antisense); TREM-2, 5′-TCCCAAGCCCTCAACACCA-3′ (sense), 5′-TTCCAGCAAGGGTGTCATCTGCGA-3′ (antisense); GAPDH, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ (sense), 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ (antisense). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed with a LightCycler (Roche Applied Science) using SYBR Green (TOYOBO). The values were normalized with those of GAPDH. Luciferase Assay—The transcription initiation site of mouse TREM-2 promoter was determined with the 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′ RACE) system (Invitrogen). The mouse OSCAR promoter was reported previously (30So H. Rho J. Jeong D. Park R. Fisher D.E. Ostrowski M.C. Choi Y. Kim N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24209-24216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The 1.7-kb fragment of the OSCAR promoter and 1.5-kb fragment of the TREM-2 promoter regions were amplified by PCR using the following primers: OSCAR promoter, 5′-ACGCGTGAGCGACAGTAATGTCAGGA-3′ (sense), 5′-CTCGAGCCGTGGAGCTGAGGAAAAGGT-3′ (antisense); TREM-2 promoter, 5′-ACGCGTAAGACTGGGCTGCGTAGGGGC-3′(sense), 5′-TCGAGCAGCCGGAGGGGACCTTGT-3′ (antisense). The reporter plasmids were constructed by inserting the amplified fragment of the OSCAR or TREM-2 promoter into the NotI/XhoI site of the PicaGene luciferase reporter plasmid (Toyo Ink). The reporter plasmids of mouse TRAP and calcitonin receptor promoters, and the expression vectors of NFATc1 were described previously (7Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M. Yoshida H.

Expression vectors of PU.1 (31DeKoter R.P. Lee H.J. Singh H.

Transfection of HEK293T cells and measurement of luciferase activity were performed as previously described (7Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M. Yoshida H. Saiura A. Isobe M.

Cell. 2002; 3: 889-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar) using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Mouse BMMs cultured with or without RANKL stimulation were harvested at days 0–2, and a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed using ChIP Assay Kit (Upstate) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cross-linked chromatin was immunoprecipitated with the antibody against NFATc1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or control IgG (BD Biosciences). The following primers specific for the OSCAR and TREM-2 promoters were used: OSCAR promoter, 5′-GCCTTCTCTTGTTACCGGC-3′ (sense), 5′-GAAGCAACACCAGAAAGCCATGTG-3′ (antisense); TREM-2 promoter, 5′-AGGGTTGTGTTCTGGTGAC-3′ (sense), 5′-GCAGAAAAGAGATGACCAAGCCAG-3′ (antisense). RNA Interference—For transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA), mouse BMMs were plated on 24-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells per well. Transfection of siRNA was performed on day 1 using TransIT-TKO Transfection Reagent (Mirus Bio) according to the manufacturer's protocol. siRNA specific for green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used as a control, and Cy3-labeled nonspecific siRNA (B-Bridge International) was used to estimate the transfection efficiency. siRNAs for NFATc1 and GFP were synthesized by Proligo LLC. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed with samples harvested on day 3. The values of mRNA expression were normalized with those of GAPDH. Statistical Analysis—Throughout this report, statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test (*, p < 0.05), and all data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. (n = 3). OSCAR and TREM-2 Are Cooperatively Involved in Osteoclastogenesis—Chimeric proteins of the Fc portion of immunoglobulin and the ligand-binding domain of a certain receptor are often used for detecting putative ligands of the receptor and for blocking signals mediated by the ligand (21Shiratori I. Ogasawara K. Saito T. Lanier L.L. Arase H. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 23Kim N. Takami M. Rho J. Josien R. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). First, we constructed expression plasmids for soluble OSCAR-Fc and TREM-2-Fc chimeric proteins by fusing the extracellular domain of each immunoreceptor to the Fc portion of human IgG1. Culture supernatants were collected after transfection of the plasmids into COS7 cells, and the expression of the soluble proteins was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1A). OSCAR-Fc was detected as a ∼57-kDa band (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 3), and it migrated to ∼50 kDa after N-glycopeptidase F treatment (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 4), indicating OSCAR-Fc is secreted as a glycosylated form. This core size is in agreement with the predicted molecular mass of OSCAR-Fc. TREM-2-Fc was detected as a ∼55-kDa molecule (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 7) and migrated to ∼50 kDa after N-glycopeptidase F treatment (Fig. 1A, lanes 6 and 8). To examine the expression of putative ligands of OSCAR and TREM-2, osteoblasts derived from mouse calvaria were cultured with or without the osteotropic factors 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 and PGE2 for 6 days and stained with either control human IgG, OSCAR-Fc, or TREM-2-Fc. Putative ligands of OSCAR were detected on primary osteoblasts stimulated with 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 and PGE2 as reported previously (23Kim N. Takami M. Rho J. Josien R. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), whereas putative ligands of TREM-2 were detected both on non-stimulated and stimulated primary osteoblasts (Fig. 1B). This is, to our knowledge, the first report to show that the putative ligands of TREM-2 are expressed on osteoblasts and that the expression of OSCAR ligands and TREM-2 ligands is differently regulated. Next, we tested the effect of OSCAR-Fc and TREM-2-Fc on osteoclast differentiation by adding 20 μg ml-1 of OSCAR-Fc or TREM-2-Fc to co-cultures of BMMs and osteoblasts (Fig. 1C). TRAP-positive multinucleated cells with more than three nuclei were counted as osteoclasts on day 7. OSCAR-Fc markedly inhibited osteoclast formation, and TREM-2-Fc also had an inhibitory effect, albeit with lower efficiency. The inhibitory effect of TREM-2-Fc on murine osteoclast differentiation is in agreement with the previous reports that osteoclast differentiation is impaired in cells isolated from patients with Nasu-Hakola disease, which is caused by loss-of-function mutations in either the TREM-2 or DAP12 gene (33Paloneva J. Mandelin J. Kiialainen A. Bohling T. Prudlo J. Hakola P. Haltia M. Konttinen Y.T. Peltonen L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 34Cella M. Buonsanti C. Strader C. Kondo T. Salmaggi A. Colonna M. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). When both OSCAR-Fc and TREM-2-Fc (10 μg ml-1 each) were added, osteoclast differentiation was further suppressed. These results indicate OSCAR and TREM-2 are cooperatively involved in osteoclastogenesis. Expression of OSCAR and TREM-2 during Osteoclast Differentiation— To examine the expression of OSCAR and TREM-2 on osteoclast precursor cells, mouse BMMs were cultured with or without RANKL for 3 days in the presence of M-CSF, following a 2-day culture with M-CSF alone. Samples harvested at days 0–3 were used for quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Fig. 2A shows that the expression of OSCAR mRNA was progressively and significantly up-regulated during osteoclast differentiation. It increased by ∼600-fold on day 2 and 1200-fold on day 3. Interestingly, OSCAR induction was strongly inhibited when the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 was added along with RANKL. In contrast, RANKL stimulation barely induced TREM-2 mRNA expression, and the addition of FK506 did not have a significant effect on TREM-2 mRNA expression (Fig. 2A). Similarly, the expression of OSCAR protein was also up-regulated in the course of osteoclast differentiation and was strongly reduced by FK506 (Fig. 2B). The expression of TREM-2 protein was not significantly affected by either RANKL or FK506, displaying a similar expression pattern to that of TREM-2 mRNA (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that OSCAR expression is transcriptionally regulated by NFATc1, which is the master transcription factor for osteoclastogenesis. However, TREM-2, the expression of which is relatively constant throughout the process of osteoclast differentiation, appears not to be regulated by NFATc1. The OSCAR Promoter, but Not the TREM-2 Promoter, Has Multiple NFAT Binding Sites—Previous analysis of the mouse OSCAR promoter revealed that the transcription factors MITF and PU.1 are important for the regulation of the OSCAR gene expression (30So H. Rho J. Jeong D. Park R. Fisher D.E. Ostrowski M.C. Choi Y. Kim N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24209-24216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of NFATc1, which is critical for the differentiation of osteoclasts, has not been previously investigated on the transactivation of either OSCAR or TREM-2 promoter. To study the transcriptional regulation of OSCAR and TREM-2 genes by NFATc1, we analyzed the putative promoter regions of mouse OSCAR and TREM-2 using a program for predicting transcription factor binding sites (TFSEARCH, www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html) (Fig. 3, A and B). The transcription initiation site of TREM-2 was determined by 5′ RACE. As expected from the expression patterns during osteoclast differentiation (Fig. 2), the TREM-2 promoter contained no putative NFAT binding site, whereas multiple putative NFAT binding sites were found in the OSCAR promoter. However, the TREM-2 promoter contained one MITF and two PU.1 binding sites (Fig. 3, A and B). NFATc1 Synergistically Enhances the Activity of the OSCAR Promoter in Combination with PU.1 and MITF—To examine the transcriptional regulation of OSCAR and TREM-2 by NFATc1, luciferase reporter plasmids containing the mouse OSCAR promoter or TREM-2 promoter were constructed and transfected into HEK293T c"
https://openalex.org/W2022483292,"Components that propagate inflammation in joint disease may be derived from cartilage since the inflammation resolves after joint replacement. We found that the cartilage component fibromodulin has the ability to activate an inflammatory cascade, i.e. complement. Fibromodulin and immunoglobulins cause comparable deposition of C1q, C4b, and C3b from human serum. Using C1q and factor B-deficient sera in combination with varying contents of metal ions, we established that fibromodulin activates both the classical and the alternative pathways of complement. Further studies revealed that fibromodulin binds directly to the globular heads of C1q, leading to activation of C1. However, deposition of the membrane attack complex and C5a release were lower in the presence of fibromodulin as compared with IgG. This can be explained by the fact that fibromodulin also binds complement inhibitor factor H. Factor H and C1q bind to non-overlapping sites on fibromodulin, but none of the interactions is mediated by the negatively charged keratan sulfate substituents of fibromodulin. C1q but not factor H binds to an N-terminal fragment of fibromodulin previously implicated to be affected in cartilage stimulated with the inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1. Taken together our observations indicate fibromodulin as one factor involved in the sustained inflammation of the joint.

Taken together our observations indicate fibromodulin as one factor involved in the sustained inflammation of the joint. The complement system forms the core of the innate immune system and is organized in three different routes depending on initiating agent such as antibodies (classical pathway) or certain carbohydrates (lectin pathway). The alternative pathway is started by autoactivation of unstable complement factor C3 (1Pillemer L. Blum L. Lepow I.H. Ross O.A. Todd E.W. Wardlaw A.C. Science. 1954; 120: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) and its subsequent binding to a surface lacking complement inhibitors, mainly factor H (FH). 2The abbreviations used are: FH, factor H; CRP, C-reactive protein; FM, fibromodulin;MAC, membrane attack complex; PRELP, proline-arginine-rich-end-leucine-rich repeat protein; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. FH is able to protect self-surfaces where it is localized due to its ability to bind sialic acid and heparan sulfate (2Meri S. Pangburn M.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The main event of complement activation is formation of enzymatic complexes such as C3 and C5 convertases, which leads to release of anaphylatoxins C5a and C3a (3Kohl J. Mol. Immunol. 2001; 38: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and deposition of C3-fragments that are recognized by phagocytes (4Smith B.O. Mallin R.L. Krych-Goldberg M. Wang X. Hauhart R.E. Bromek K. Uhrin D. Atkinson J.P. Barlow P.N. Cell. 2002; 108: 769-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The final stage is the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). The control of this powerful system is maintained by a number of soluble or membrane-bound inhibitory proteins. Most inhibitors such as FH act on C3 and C5 convertases either by increasing the dissociation of enzyme complexes or by promoting degradation of C3b or C4b by the serine proteinase factor I. The physiological relevance of complement is demonstrated by recurrent infections when there are deficiencies of complement components and central involvement of the system in systemic lupus erythematosus and glomerulonephritis (5Morgan B.P. Walport M.J. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 301-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). However, complement resembles a double-edged sword as it also contributes to the pathogenesis of ischemic injury, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and many more diseases (6Morgan B.P. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1995; 32: 265-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It appears that the undesirable side effects of complement are mainly due to excessive activation or activation initiated by erroneous molecules. For example, the complement system is involved in the pathology of Alzheimer disease and prion diseases due to the ability of the C1 complex to interact with abnormal protein structures (7Rogers J. Cooper N.R. Webster S. Schultz J. McGeer P.L. Styren S.D. Civin W.H. Brachova L. Bradt B. Ward P. Lieberburg I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

C1, the major activator of the classical pathway, is a multimolecular protease formed by the association of a recognition protein, C1q, and a catalytic subunit, a calcium-dependent tetramer of the two proteases C1s and C1r (9Gaboriaud C. Thielens N.M. Gregory L.A. Rossi V. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Arlaud G.J. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 368-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). C1q itself is composed of six subunits, each of which contains three polypeptide chains A, B, and C. The N-terminal part of each subunit is a collagen-like, 100-amino acid-long triple helical structure (stalk) that is followed by a globular domain (head) containing portions of all three chains and representing the part that binds to activating molecules. The classical activators of C1q are clustered IgG and IgM antibodies but also C-reactive protein (CRP), DNA-histone complexes, and lipopolysaccharide and surface molecules exposed on anoxic endothelial cells (for review, see Ref. 10Gewurz H. Ying S.C. Jiang H. Lint T.F. Behring Inst. Mitt. 1993; 93: 138-147PubMed Google Scholar). A well established clinical observation, pertinent to understanding of mechanisms in joint disease, is that joint replacement surgery is an effective treatment by e.g. ameliorating inflammation. We have now found that one of the cartilage molecules, fibromodulin, may have a role in propagating this inflammation by activating complement. Cartilage contains low numbers of cells separated by a predominating extracellular matrix with several distinct supramolecular assemblies. These include extremely negatively charged proteoglycans (aggrecan) in networks of collagen fibers. The latter contains many additional molecules bound to provide stability and interactions with surrounding structures. Among these molecules are members of the leucine-rich repeat protein family, such as decorin, biglycan, asporin, fibromodulin, lumican, PRELP (proline-arginine-rich-end-leucine-rich repeat protein), and chondroadherin (for review, see Ref. 11Heinegård D. Aspberg A. Franzén A. Lorenzo P. Royce P. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders: Molecular, Genetic, and Medical Aspects. 2nd. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York2002: 271-291Crossref Google Scholar). Some leucine-rich repeat proteins, present in several tissues, including cartilage, have previously been found to interact with complement factors. Thus, C1q binds to decorin (12Krumdieck R. Höök M. Rosenberg L.C. Volanakis J.E. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3695-3701PubMed Google Scholar), fibronectin (13Bing D.H. Almeda S. Isliker H. Lahav J. Hynes R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4198-4201Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Sorvillo J. Gigli I. Pearlstein E. Biochem. J. 1985; 226: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and laminin (15Bohnsack J.F. Tenner A.J. Laurie G.W. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Brown E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3824-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, in none of these examples does the interaction lead to activation of the complement cascade. Fibromodulin (FM) was first described as a 59-kDa protein (16Heinegård D. Larsson T. Sommarin Y. Franzen A. Paulsson M. Hedbom E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13866-13872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that interacts with collagen types I and II (17Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6898-6905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is present on collagen fibers in cartilage (18Hedlund H. Mengarelli-Widholm S. Heinegard D. Reinholt F.P. Svensson O. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Its closest relatives based on gene organization and sequence are lumican, keratocan, and PRELP. FM often contains one or two keratan sulfate chains, distributed among the four potential substitution sites all present in the leucine-rich region (19Oldberg A. Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegard D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2601-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), whereas the N-terminal region is anionic, containing up to nine tyrosine sulfate residues (20Antonsson P. Heinegård D. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16859-16861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Önnerfjord P. Heathfield T.F. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). FM is thought to play an important role in collagen fiber formation as shown by the observation that FM null mice form abnormal collagen fibrils in tendons (22Svensson L. Aszodi A. Reinholt F.P. Fassler R. Heinegård D. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9636-9647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In the present study we have investigated the interaction between FM and the globular heads of C1q which leads to activation of complement, suggesting that FM is one of the factors fueling joint inflammation. Proteins, Proteoglycans, and Sera—C1q was purified from human serum as described previously (23Tenner A.J. Lesavre P.H. Cooper N.R. J. Immunol. 1981; 27: 648-653Google Scholar). Serum depleted of C1q was obtained via the first step of this purification (Biorex 70 ion exchange chromatography, Bio-Rad) or purchased from Quidel. Pooled human serum was prepared from the blood of healthy volunteers. Factor B-deficient serum was from Quidel, FM was isolated from both bovine and human articular cartilage (16Heinegård D. Larsson T. Sommarin Y. Franzen A. Paulsson M. Hedbom E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13866-13872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and FH was from human plasma (24Blom A.M. Kask L. Dahlbäck B. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 39: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In most experiments described in this study we have used bovine FM, which is easier to obtain than human FM since cartilage is the starting material for the purification. However, all crucial experiments were also repeated with human FM with the same results. C3-met, which functionally corresponds to C3b, was prepared by treatment of C3 with methylamine according to the previously published protocol (25Blom A.M. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43437-43442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The preparation of stalk and head portions of C1q was performed according to published protocols (26Paques E.P. Huber R. Preiss H. Wright J.K. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1979; 360: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Reid K.B. Porter R.R. Biochem. J. 1976; 155: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), where pepsin (Worthington) and collagenase (from Clostridium histolyticum, Worthington), respectively, were used for partial digestion of C1q. Keratan sulfate was prepared by papain digestion of cartilage as described (28Antonopoulos C.A. Fransson L.A. Gardell S. Heinegard D. Acta Chem. Scand. 1969; 23: 2616-2620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and heparin was from Leo. The 10-kDa fragment of FM was prepared by proteolytic digestion of the protein as described previously (21Önnerfjord P. Heathfield T.F. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 29Heathfield T.F. Önnerfjord P. Dahlberg L. Heinegård D. J. Biol.

Complement Activation Assay—All incubation steps were made with 50 μl of solution for 1 h and in room temperature except when stated otherwise. Every step was followed by extensive washing with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween, pH 7.5. Microtiter plates (Maxisorp, Nunc) were coated overnight at 4 °C with either FM (10 μg/ml), aggregated human IgG (5 μg/ml, Immuno), human IgM (2 μg/ml, Sigma, for C3b-deposition), mannan (100 μg/ml, Sigma, for lectin pathway) or zymosan (20 μg/ml, Sigma, for alternative pathway) diluted in 75 mm sodium carbonate, pH 9.6. The wells were blocked for 2 h with 200 μl of 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline.Dilutions of human serum or sera deficient in C1q or factor B in GVB +2 (2.5 mm veronal buffer, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% gelatin, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.15 mm CaCl2) or Mg-EGTA (2.5 mm veronal buffer, pH 7.3, 70 mm NaCl, 140 mm glucose, 0.1% gelatin, 7 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm EGTA) were added to the plates and incubated for 20 min (for detection of C3b and C4b) or 45 min (C1q, MAC components) at 37 °C followed by incubation with specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies against C1q (Dako), C3d (Dako), C4b (Dako), mouse monoclonal antibodies against iC3b (Quidel), C5b-9 (Quidel), or goat polyclonal antibodies against C7 (in-house) and C8 and C9 (both Advanced Research Technology) diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies against rabbit, mouse, or goat immunoglobulins (Dako, 1:1000 in blocking solution) were then allowed to bind. Bound enzyme was assayed using 1,2-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride tablets (Dako), and absorbance was measured at 490 nm. For C5a ELISA, microtiter plates were coated with FM or human IgG and blocked as described above for the complement activation assay. The wells were then incubated with serum dilutions in GVB2+ for 15 min at 37 °C. The samples were immediately assayed using a C5a-ELISA kit (IBL, Hamburg) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Statistical significance of the observed differences was estimated using Student's t test. Direct Binding Assay—Coating, washing, blocking, and detection were performed as described for the complement activation assay. The proteins used for coating the plates were 5 μg/ml aggregated human IgG or 10 μg/ml FM, C1q, C3-met, and CRP (Calbiochem). After blocking, 50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, with increasing concentrations of proteins (FM, C1q, or FH) was added to the wells and left to incubate for 4 h or, alternatively, overnight at 4 °C. The plates were then incubated with rabbit antibodies against FM (16Heinegård D. Larsson T. Sommarin Y. Franzen A. Paulsson M. Hedbom E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13866-13872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), C1q (Dako), or monoclonal anti-FH antibodies (Quidel) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies against rabbit or mouse immunoglobulins (Dako, 1:1000 in blocking solution) and development with 1,2-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride tablets. The binding buffer was supplemented with increasing NaCl concentrations to test the interactions for dependence on ionic strength. When further examining the interaction between FH and FM, heparin at 0.2 or 20 mg/ml was added in the binding step. For determination of metal ion dependence 5 mm EDTA was included in the binding buffer. When assessing the influence of keratan sulfate on the interactions, the standard protocol for direct binding was followed, except during the binding step where a fixed concentration of protein was used (5 μg/ml C1q or 15 μg/ml FH), and 10 or 50 μg/ml keratan sulfate was added to the binding buffer. C1q Head/Stalk Binding—Microtiter plates were coated with 5 μg/ml human IgG, 10 μg/ml FM, intact C1q, C1q heads, or C1q stalks as described for the complement activation assay. The blocking solutions used were 3% fish gelatin (Norland) in washing buffer for the direct binding experiments and 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for the assay testing blocking antibodies. In the latter case 3 μg/ml C1q was preincubated for 40 min at room temperature with a 50-fold molar excess of monoclonal antibodies against the head or stalk portions of C1q (a kind gift of Dr. E. Hack, Crucell, Leiden, The Netherlands (30Hoekzema R. Martens M. Brouwer M.C. Hack C.E. Mol. Immunol. 1988; 25: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)) immediately before binding of C1q and FM by incubation overnight at 4 °C. The bound proteins were detected using the antibodies and the procedure described for the complement activation and binding assays above. Competition ELISA—FM (10 μg/ml) was coated onto microtiter plates, and the wells were blocked as described above for the complement activation assay. Incubation with either 5 μg/ml C1q with increasing concentrations of FH (0 –20 μg/ml) or 15 μg/ml FH with the addition of C1q (0 – 60 μg/ml) in binding buffer followed. The proteins were allowed to interact for 4 h at room temperature after which bound proteins were detected with specific antibodies as described for the complement activation and binding assay. Binding to Deglycosylated FM—FM was incubated with N-glycosidase F (Roche Applied Science) in 50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, on a shaker overnight at 37 °C. The final FM concentration was 17 μg/ml, and the amount of enzyme used was 1 unit/μg of protein. To verify complete digestion, the protein was separated by electrophoresis on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Binding between deglycosylated FM and C1q/FH was assessed using the direct binding assay. Binding of C1q and FH to the 10-kDa N-terminal Fragment of FM— Streptavidin (Sigma) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml was coated onto microtiter plates at 4 °C overnight. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h, the biotinylated 10-kDa fragment, at a concentration of 5 μg/mlin50mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 2mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, was added to the wells and allowed to bind overnight at 4 °C. Next, C1q or FH were added at 15 μg/ml in the same buffer and incubated for 4 h. Bound C1q and FH were detected with specific antibodies as described for the complement activation and binding assays. Surface Plasmon Resonance (Biacore)—The interaction between C1q and FM was analyzed using surface plasmon resonance (Biacore 2000, Biacore). Two flow cells of a CM5 sensor chip were activated, each with 20 μl of a mixture of 0.2 m 1-ethyl-3-(3 dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide at a flow rate of 5 μl/min, after which FM (20 μg/mlin10mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5) was injected over flow cell 2 to reach 2000 resonance units. Unreacted groups were blocked with 20 μl of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. A negative control was prepared by activating and subsequently blocking the surface of flow cell 1. The association kinetics was studied for various concentrations of purified C1q in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, supplemented with 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20. Protein solutions were injected for 60 or 400 s during the association phase at a constant flow rate of 30 μl/min. The sample was injected first over the negative control surface and then over immobilized FM. The signal from the control surface was subtracted. The dissociation was followed for 200 s at the same flow rate. In all experiments, a 30-μl bolus of 2 m NaCl, 100 mm HCl,5mm EDTA was used to remove bound ligands during a regeneration step. The BiaEvaluation 3.0 software (Biacore) was used to analyze sensograms obtained and to calculate rate affinity constants. Electron Microscopy—The structure of C1q-FM complexes was analyzed by negative staining and electron microscopy as described previously (31Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were about 10 μg/mlin50mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and 5-μl aliquots were adsorbed onto carbon-coated grids for 1 min, washed with two drops of water, and stained with two drops of 0.75% uranyl formate. The grids were rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge at low pressure in air. In some experiments the fibromodulin particles were identified by labeling with colloidal thiocyanate gold (32Baschong W. Lucocq J.M. Roth J. Histochemistry. 1985; 83: 409-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Specimens were observed in a Jeol JEM 1230 electron microscope operated at a 60-kV accelerating voltage. Images were recorded with a Gatan Multiscan 791 CCD camera. FM Activates Human Complement—The ability of FM to activate human complement was assessed using a microtiter plate-based assay in which FM or aggregated human IgG or IgM was bound to plastic and incubated with normal human serum followed by detection of various deposited complement factors with specific antibodies. FM induced strong deposition of C1q, C4b, and C3b at levels similar to the positive control of human immunoglobulins (Fig. 1). Throughout the experiments we used aggregated human IgG to activate complement, but when measuring the deposition of C3b, human IgM was the activator. This was due to a certain degree of cross-reactivity between the IgG preparation and anti-C3 antibodies causing a high background. Although IgG caused strong deposition of C9 (a component of MAC), less C9 was detected on plates coated with FM (Fig. 2A). We also compared the deposition levels of several other components of the terminal MAC triggered by FM and immunoglobulins. FM proved to give rise to a consistently significant but lower levels of MAC formation than IgM (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Formation of MAC and C5a in the presence of immunoglobulins and FM. A, the plates were coated with FM or IgG and incubated with dilutions of normal human serum in GVB2+. As a measure of MAC formation, deposited C9 was detected with specific antibodies. B, release of C5a in 3.3% human serum incubated with FM and IgG was measured with a specific ELISA kit. *** denotes statistically significant differences; p <0.001 in Student's t test. C, human serum (1%) in GVB2+ was allowed to react with coated FM and IgM, and MAC formation was detected with specific antibodies directed against C7, C8, C9, and a neo-epitope on C5b-9. Data are normalized and given as the means of triplicates with bars indicating S.D, except in C, which is the representation of data from two experiments performed each in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using an ELISA assay for detection of released C5a we found that FM caused less than half the level as compared with IgG (Fig. 2B). Based on the concentrations of standard samples supplied in the ELISA kit, we estimate the FM-mediated release of C5a in the conditions used to be 1.5 ng/ml. Apparently FM is able to initiate the early steps of the complement cascade. In contrast to what is observed with IgG, the later steps appear to be inhibited to some extent when FM is used as the activator, and there is less activation of C5. FM Activates Complement via the Classical and the Alternative Pathways—When human serum depleted of C1q was used, we did not detect any complement activation measured as deposition of C4b neither on IgG nor FM (Figs. 3, A and B). The C1q-depleted serum that we used had an intact lectin pathway since C4b deposition could be achieved by coating mannan to the microtiter plates (Fig. 3B). To investigate if FM can directly activate the alternative pathway, we used human serum diluted in Mg-EGTA buffer lacking calcium. This solution does not allow activation of lectin and classical pathways. Under these conditions FM caused deposition of C9 in a manner similar to zymosan, which is a known activator of the alternative pathway, whereas IgG did not trigger significant activation (Fig. 3C). No FM-mediated C9 deposition could be detected in Mg-EGTA when using factor B-deficient serum, confirming that the activity was indeed a result of alternative pathway activation (Fig. 3C).However, when factor B-deficient serum was exposed to FM in a GVB2 buffer, there was a prominent complement activation via the classical pathway (not shown). Also, there was FM-mediated C3b deposition in C1q-deficient serum in Mg-EGTA buffer (not shown). We conclude that FM is able to activate directly both the classical and alternative pathways of complement. The kinetics of FM-mediated complement activation in GVB2+ buffer that allows activation of all complement pathways was rapid as compared with zymosan. Maximal complement activation by FM as measured by deposition of C3b was obtained already at 15 min of incubation with serum (5 min for 50% of activation) and resembled the result obtained with IgM (Fig. 3D). The observation suggests that in the presence of calcium FM will activate complement mainly via the classical pathway, which is rapid and requires lower concentrations of serum than the alternative pathway. FM Binds C1q—Because FM was able to activate the classical pathway of complement via C1 it seemed plausible to hypothesize that FM interacts directly with C1q. We used a microtiter plate-based binding assay to demonstrate direct interaction between C1q and FM (Fig. 4). The binding was concentration-dependent and readily detectable at physiological ionic strength. Interaction occurred irrespective of which protein was immobilized (Fig. 4). We have also tested if there was interaction between C1s, a component of the C1-complex, and FM, but no specific binding could be detected (data not shown). Visualization of FM-C1q Interaction by Electron Microscopy—The interaction between FM and C1q was investigated by electron microscopy after adsorption onto a mica grid and negative staining. In this analysis C1q displayed its known appearance of a “bouquet of tulips” (Fig. 5D), whereas FM appeared as a small globular protein with a bent structure (Fig. 5E). When C1q and FM were incubated together before analysis by electron microscopy, we observed that FM, distinguished on the electrographs as a small globule with (Figs. 5, A and B) or without a gold label (Fig. 5C), was detected bound only to the globular heads of C1q and never to the stalks. It is noteworthy that most ligands known to activate C1q bind to this domain. Binding of C1q to FM Is Sensitive to Salt and Is Mediated by the Globular Heads of C1q—We found that binding between C1q and FM was decreased with increasing NaCl concentration (Fig. 6A, left panel), indicating a role for ionic interactions. Ionic strength dependence was also observed for human IgG, but in this case higher concentrations of NaCl were required to disrupt the binding. Repeating the experiment using KCl as the ion strength provider gave the same result as for NaCl (not shown). The FM-C1q interaction was not dependent on the presence of calcium or other divalent ions as it did not decrease in the presence of 5 mm EDTA (Fig. 6A, left panel). To determine which part of C1q is responsible for the interaction with FM, isolated head and stalk portions of C1q were prepared using partial digestion with collagenase and pepsin, respectively. The preparations were analyzed by Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the separated proteins were detected by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 6B). By immobilizing these isolated parts of C1q on microtiter plates we could demonstrate that the binding of FM is localized to the globular heads (Fig. 6A, right panel). This observation was supported by the fact that monoclonal antibodies directed against the heads of C1q were able to inhibit the interaction, whereas the antibodies against the collagenous stalks of C1q did not affect binding (Fig. 6A, middle panel). The antibody directed against the globular heads also inhibited interaction between C1q and IgG albeit to a much lower extent. This can either be due to a difference in affinity between the IgG-C1q and FM-C1q interactions or, more plausibly, slightly shifted binding sites for FM and immunoglobulins on the head domains of C1q. Furthermore, we found using a direct binding assay that FM in solution is able to inhibit binding of C1q to immobilized IgG (not shown). We also performed a ligand blot by which we wanted to assess the binding of FM to A, B, and C chains of C1q separated by electrophoresis. However, no selective binding to the individual C1q chains could be detected; FM interacted with all three cha"

In vivo and in vitro data indicate an essential role of angiomotin in endothelial cell motility. Here we show that angiostatin binds angiomotin on the cell surface and provide evidence for a transmembrane model for the topology of both p80 and p130 angiomotin isoforms. Immunofluorescence analysis shows that angiomotin co-localized with ZO-1 in cell-cell contacts in endothelial cells in vitro and in angiogenic blood vessels of the postnatal mouse retina in vivo. Transfection of p80 as well as p130 angiomotin in Chinese hamster ovary cells resulted in junctional localization of both isoforms. Furthermore, p130 angiomotin could recruit ZO-1 to actin stress fibers. The p130 but not p80 isoform could be coprecipitated with MAGI-1b, a component of endothelial tight junctions. Paracellular permeability, as measured by diffusion of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran, was reduced by p80 and p130 angiomotin expression with 70 and 88%, respectively, compared with control. Angiostatin did not have any effect on cell permeability but inhibited the migration of angiomotin-expressing cells in the Boyden chamber assay. We conclude that angiomotin, in addition to controlling cell motility, may play a role in the assembly of endothelial cell-cell junctions.

We conclude that angiomotin, in addition to controlling cell motility, may play a role in the assembly of endothelial cell-cell junctions. Angiogenesis, the formation of novel blood vessels by a process of sprouting or intussusceptive growth, has attracted considerable interest since it was shown to be crucial for tumor progression (1Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7215) Google Scholar). Sprouting angiogenesis involves several steps: proliferation of endothelial cells, modification of the extracellular matrix, cell migration, and tube morphogenesis. The balance between specific growth factors and inhibitors controls this process (2Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6086) Google Scholar). One of the identified inhibitors is angiostatin, a 38-kDa proteolytic fragment of plasminogen, which has been shown to potently inhibit angiogenesis and the growth of metastases in mice (3O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3170) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have shown that angiostatin can inhibit endothelial cell proliferation (3O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J.

Sim B.K. Wu Z. Grau G.E. Shing Y. Soff G.A. Bouck N. Pepper M.S. Blood. 1998; 92: 4730-4741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, angiostatin has a short half-life in vivo and is hard to produce in sufficient amounts, which makes it difficult to utilize as a therapeutic agent (7Bouquet C. Frau E. Opolon P. Connault E. Abitbol M. Griscelli F. Yeh P. Perricaudet M. Mol. Ther. 2003; 7: 174-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We have identified angiomotin by its ability to bind angiostatin in a yeast two-hybrid screen. p80 angiomotin is a protein of 675 residues that is expressed in human endothelium and is a member of a conserved family of proteins that comprises two other proteins in human: angiomotin-like 1/JEAP and angiomotin-like 2 (8Bratt A. Wilson W.J. Troyanovsky B. Aase K. Kessler R. Van Meir E.G. Holmgren L. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 298: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest transcriptional diversity within this protein family (9Moreau J. Lord M. Boucher M. Belleau P. Fernandes M.J. Gene. 2005; 350: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The effects of angiomotin on transfected endothelial cells are stimulatory: the cells become more motile and invasive as determined by in vivo and in vitro assays. However, this effect can be blocked by angiostatin (10Troyanovsky B. Levchenko T. Mansson G. Matvijenko O. Holmgren L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 11Levchenko T. Aase K. Troyanovsky B. Bratt A. Holmgren L. J.

Thus, angiostatin blocks tube formation of angiomotin-transfected cells in the Matrigel tube formation assay as well as migration of angiomotin-transfected cells in the Boyden chamber assay. Also, angiomotin-deficient mouse embryos exhibit impaired migration of the visceral endoderm (13Shimono A. Behringer R.R. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 613-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These data indicate that angiomotin may act as a promoter of angiogenesis by enhancing cell motility and migration and that angiostatin is an antagonist of angiomotin. The mechanism by which angiomotin promotes cell motility has not been defined, but in vivo and in vitro evidence shows that the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif is crucial (11Levchenko T. Aase K. Troyanovsky B. Bratt A. Holmgren L. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3803-3810Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). p80 angiomotin localizes to lamellipodia of migrating cells (10Troyanovsky B. Levchenko T. Mansson G. Matvijenko O. Holmgren L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), and angiomotin promotes cell spreading on several different matrices, which indicates that angiomotin can control organization of the actin cytoskeleton. 3A. Bratt, S. Narumiya, and L. Holmgren, manuscript in preparation. Angiomotin also has the ability to stabilize endothelial tubes in the Matrigel in vitro angiogenesis assay (12Levchenko T. Bratt A. Arbiser J.L. Holmgren L. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1469-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Apart from angiomotin, other receptors for angiostatin have been identified, for example ATP synthase (14Moser T.L. Kenan D.J. Ashley T.A. Roy J.A. Goodman M.D. Misra U.K. Cheek D.J. Pizzo S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6656-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), the integrin αVβ3 (15Tarui T. Miles L.A. Takada Y. J. Biol.

Blood. 2003; 101: 1857-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism by which angiostatin down-regulates neovascularization remains to be determined. Recently, we identified a splice form of angiomotin, p130 angiomotin. 4M. Ernkvist, K. Aase, C. Ukomadu, Y. Zhou, J. Wohlshlegel, R. Blackman, N. Veitonmäki, A. Bratt, S. Fisher, A. Dutta, and L.

The formation of mature cell-cell contacts is a crucial step during angiogenesis. Silencing of endothelial adherence junction protein VE-cadherin leads to abnormal tight junctions, malformed vessels, and hemorrhages, and embryos die in utero within 9.5 days from fertilization (18Carmeliet P. Lampugnani M.G. Moons L. Breviario F. Compernolle V. Bono F. Balconi G. Spagnuolo R. Oostuyse B. Dewerchin M. Zanetti A. Angellilo A. Mattot V. Nuyens D. Lutgens E. Clotman F. de Ruiter M.C.

Endothelial tight junctions (TJ) form a seal between cells that isolates the lumen of the blood vessel from the surrounding tissue and restricts the diffusion of solutes from the blood to the surrounding cells. At the molecular level, TJs are formed by homodimerization of the specific tight junction transmembrane proteins occludin, claudin, and JAM. The cytoplasmic domains of these proteins are connected to the actin cytoskeleton through a number of adaptor proteins, such as ZO-1/2/3 and MAGI-1/2/3 (19Dejana E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Interestingly, angiomotin-like 1/JEAP is reported to localize to TJs (20Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Ono Y. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Inoue Y. Imai T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5583-5587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). TJs are structurally important for the cell and are linked to the cytoskeleton both physically and through signaling pathways. For example, the Rho family of GTPases controls both reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and formation of TJs (21Braga V.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 546-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 22Burridge K. Wennerberg K.

Science. 2005; 307: 1603-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, another type of specialized junction, the adherens junction, can be distinguished. It is thought that the main purpose of AJs is to confer adhesion between cells to maintain tissue architecture. AJs are formed by homodimerization of cadherins, with VE-cadherin being the endothelial-specific cadherin. In endothelial cells, it is difficult to distinguish between TJs and AJs, because the two types of structures occur intermingled (25Schulze C. Firth J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 773-782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ruffer C. Strey A. Janning A. Kim K.S. Gerke V. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5360-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Here we show that p80 and p130 angiomotin are membrane proteins involved in control of permeability in cell-cell junctions but that the effect of angiostatin is limited to inhibiting migration of angiomotin-expressing cells. Cell Culture—MAE cells stably expressing p80 and p130 angiomotin (10Troyanovsky B. Levchenko T. Mansson G. Matvijenko O. Holmgren L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture. CHO cells stably expressing p80 or p130 angiomotin were generated by transfecting CHO cells with pcDNA3 with an insert of either p80 angiomotin or p130 angiomotin using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and selecting clones with G418 at 0.4 mg/ml. Bovine capillary endothelial (BCE) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 ng bFGF/ml. All cell culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Plasmid Construction—The cDNA for p80-angiomotin and p130-angiomotin were subcloned into the pENTR-2B vector (Gateway, Invitrogen) and then recombined into the converted Gateway destination vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) using the LR recombination reaction (Gateway, Invitrogen). FLAG-tagged MAGI-1b and MAGI-1c were as described (27Dobrosotskaya I.Y. James G.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Three different polyclonal antibodies against the following domains of angiomotin were used: the angiostatin binding domain (B3 antibody) (10Troyanovsky B. Levchenko T. Mansson G. Matvijenko O. Holmgren L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), the C-terminal (TLE antibody), and N-terminal antibodies of p130 angiomotin 4M. Ernkvist, K. Aase, C. Ukomadu, Y. Zhou, J. Wohlshlegel, R. Blackman, N. Veitonmäki, A. Bratt, S. Fisher, A. Dutta, and L. Holmgren, submitted for publication. (Fig. 3A). The following mouse monoclonal antibodies were used: 9E10 anti-Myc tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), M2 anti-FLAG tag (Sigma), AC-15 anti-actin (Sigma), 1A12 anti-ZO-1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), C060 anti-caveolin (BD Transduction Laboratories), 349 anti-paxillin (BD Transduction Laboratories), and OC-3F10 anti-occludin (BD Transduction Laboratories). Also rat monoclonal Mec 13.3 anti-CD31/PECAM (BD Pharmingen) and rabbit anti plasminogen (DAKO) were used. Angiostatin—Angiostatin was generated by elastase degradation of plasminogen as previously described (3O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3170) Google Scholar). Western Blot—Proteins were separated on 7.5% Criterion SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to Protran nitrocellulose membranes by semi-dry blotting. Membranes were blocked by incubation with PBS with 5% milk and incubated with primary antibody at 4 °C overnight followed by incubation with HRP-donkey anti-rabbit or HRP-sheep anti mouse (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. The filters were washed several times in PBS plus 0.05% Tween, and the signal was visualized with Western blotting Luminol Reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Biotinylation Experiments—∼10 million confluent cells were briefly rinsed twice in PBS and incubated with NHS-Sulfo-LC-Biotin (Pierce, 0.4 mg/ml) in PBS or NHS-LC-biotin (0.4 mg/ml) in Me2SO for 30 min at room temperature. The plates were then rinsed with PBS. Control plates were incubated with PBS alone. One milliliter of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 140 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 3% polyethylene-9-lauryl ether (Thesit), and protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.4) was added, and the cells were harvested using a rubber policeman. Lysates were spun at 30,000 × g for 25 min, and the supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation by incubation with 1 μg of either B3 angiomotin antibody or paxillin antibody and 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose slurry (Pierce). The beads were washed three times in lysis buffer with 1% Thesit. Proteins were eluted with 30 μl of Laemmli buffer, and half of the material was loaded onto a 10% precast Criterion gel (Bio-Rad) and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Biotinylated proteins were detected with HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce). Trypsin Treatment—Confluent cells grown on 6-cm Petri dishes were washed twice with calcium- and magnesium-free PBS and incubated with 1 ml of sequence grade trypsin (Sigma) at 2 μg/ml or PBS alone at 37 °C for the indicated times. At 80 min a sample of cells was examined for integrity of the membrane using trypan blue, and it was found that 90% of cells had intact cell membranes. The experiment was ended by washing the cells once in PBS and adding 75 μl of Laemmli buffer. Samples were analyzed by Western blot. Triton X-114 Phase Separation—This step was performed as described previously (28Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K.M. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., NY2005Google Scholar). Angiostatin Binding Assay—Human angiostatin (kringles 1-4) was labeled with 125I by the Iodogen method according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Pierce). The specific activity was estimated at 15,000 cpm/ng of protein. For binding assays HeLa cells stably expressing p80 angiomotin or empty vector were grown to confluency in 12-well plates. The cells were washed with PBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA and were incubated with 10 ng/ml radiolabeled angiostatin for 2 h. Cells were then washed five times with PBS with 1 mg/ml BSA and lysed with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and radioactivity was measured in a gamma counter. Cross-linking Experiments—Confluent MAE cells grown on 15-cm plates were incubated with angiostatin (5 μg/ml) in PBS with 0.05% BSA for 100 min at 4 °C when cross-linkers BS 3A. Bratt, S. Narumiya, and L. Holmgren, manuscript in preparation. and Sulfo-EGS (Pierce) were added to a final concentration of 2.5 mm for each. The cells were then incubated for additional 2 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed and lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and protease inhibitors and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was carried out from the supernatant with plasminogen antibody bound to protein A beads (Sigma). In Vitro Binding Assay—His-tagged angiostatin binding domain and p80 angiomotin recombinant proteins (described in Ref. 10Troyanovsky B. Levchenko T. Mansson G. Matvijenko O. Holmgren L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) were supplied by Bioinvent International AB, Lund. His-tagged Endostatin was used as negative control (kindly provided by Thomas Boehm, Children's Hospital, Boston). 2 μg of His-tagged proteins was coupled to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) in binding buffer (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Na2HPO4, and 0.05% Tween) at 4 °C for 2 h. Coupled beads were washed four times in binding buffer, and unspecific binding sites were blocked in binding buffer containing 1% milk. Kringle 4, K1-3, and plasminogen proteins were kindly provided by American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT. Equimolar amounts of plasminogen and the different kringle fragments were added to the beads and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively in binding buffer. The beads were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using a 12.5% gel, transferred electrophoretically, and visualized using electrochemiluminescence (ECL) using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against plasminogen. Immunofluorescence—Cells plated on chamber slides (Falcon) were rinsed briefly in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and (if not stated otherwise) treated with 0.05% Triton X-100 for 30 s. Cells were then incubated with 5% horse serum for 60 min, incubated with primary antibody diluted in 5% horse serum for 1 h, washed four times in PBS, and incubated with Texas red horse anti-mouse (Vector Laboratories Inc.) or FITC swine anti-rabbit (DAKO) diluted in 5% horse serum for 1 h. F-actin was visualized with Texas red phalloidin (Molecular Probes). For immunofluorescence of mouse retinas, eyes from C57BL6 mice sacrificed at P5 were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS at 4 °C for 2-3 h and washed in PBS. Retinas were dissected as previously described (29Chan-Ling T.L. Halasz P. Stone J. Curr. Eye Res. 1990; 9: 459-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature in a permeabilization/blocking buffer (PBB, PBS containing 1% BSA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 5% normal goat serum). Retinas were then incubated at 4 °C overnight with primary antibodies diluted in PBB buffer. After six washes with PBS at room temperature, retinas were incubated 2 h at room temperature in darkness with secondary antibody diluted in PBS plus 0.5% BSA, 0.25% Triton X-100, and 5% normal goat serum. The secondary antibodies were FITC-conjugated swine anti-rabbit (Dako), Alexa Fluor 594-goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes), and R-phycoerythrin-goat anti-rat IgG mouse (Southern Biotechnology Associates). All specimens were flat-mounted in Vectashield mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories Inc.). Pictures were captured on a Ziess Axioplan 2 microscope and processed with Zeiss Axiovision software and Adobe Photoshop. Bioinformatics Analysis—Transmembrane helices were predicted with PredictProtein (30Rost B. Fariselli P. Casadio R. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1704-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) and Tmpred (www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html). Angiomotin Induction Assay—500,000 BCE cells were plated at the indicated densities, and 24 h later cells were rinsed twice with PBS, briefly inverted on tissue paper, and lysed by addition of 100 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Samples were analyzed by Western blot using the TLE antibody. Sample volume increased with increasing plate size due to residual PBS; therefore, 10% of the volume of the lysates was loaded. Immunoprecipitation with MAGI-1—Two million CHO cells plated on 6-cm Petri dishes 1 day before were transfected with 2 μg of each plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection in a lysis buffer; 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. The cell lysates were rotated end over end at 4 °C for 15 min and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and used for the determination of total protein by the Bradford method. Lysate representing 1.5 mg of total protein were pre-cleared with 20 μl of protein A beads and then incubated with 5 μg of anti-angiomotin or anti-FLAG antibody for each IP sample for 6 h at 4°C under rotation. Afterward 30 μl of protein A beads was added to each IP sample, and the mixture was rotated overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, beads were washed twice with lysis buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, boiled, and resolved by 7.5% Criterion precast gel (Bio-Rad). For immunofluorescence staining, 40,000 CHO cells were plated in chamber slides and transfected with 0.35 μg of each plasmid with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Aggregation Assay—CHO cells were de-attached by rinsing with Ca2+ and Mg2+ PBS twice and incubation with 0.02% EDTA (Sigma) until de-attached, resuspended in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (Sigma), washed once in Hanks' balanced salt solution, and resuspended to 100,000 cells/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum dialyzed against Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS. 50,000 cells were loaded per well in 24-well plates previously coated with 1% BSA. At this time the absolute majority of cells were single cells. CaCl2 (2 mm) and angiostatin (5 μg/ml) was added where indicated. Cells were allowed to aggregate at 37 °C for 60 min during rotation on a platform rotator at 80 rpm. The experiment was stopped by addition of glutaraldehyde to a final concentration of 5%. At least five fields from each well were photographed at 10× magnification and analyzed for cell aggregation. The total number of cells (N0) was counted, and the number of cell aggregates at 60 min (N60) was counted. Aggregation index was calculated as (N0-N60)/N0 as described (31Hirata K. Ishida T. Penta K. Rezaee M. Yang E. Wohlgemuth J. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16223-16231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Approximately 500 cells were evaluated for each condition. Permeability Assay—The In Vitro Vascular Permeability assay kit from Chemicon Inc., which is based on the diffusion of FITC-labeled dextran across a cell layer grown on a membrane in a 24-well plate format, was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, CHO cells were seeded at 12,000 cells per membrane insert and allowed to form a monolayer in 5 days. Triplicate or quadruplicate inserts were used for each condition. Where indicated, angiostatin (5 μg/ml) was added to the well 1 h before the start of the experiment. FITC-dextran was added to the upper chamber, and 100-μl samples were withdrawn at 5, 15, 60, and 120 min from the lower chamber. Fluorescence was measured on a Bio-Tek FL 600 plate reader using an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. The background fluorescence of cell culture medium was subtracted. The diffusion of FITC-dextran across a membrane insert without cells was measured in parallel to ensure integrity of cell monolayers. Cell Migration Assay—A Boyden chamber migration assay was performed as described previously (10Troyanovsky B. Levchenko T. Mansson G. Matvijenko O. Holmgren L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30,000 cells in serum-free medium were loaded in each well and allowed to migrate toward serum or bFGF 20 (20 ng/ml) for 4 h. Non-migrating cells were removed, and remaining cells were fixed and stained with Giemsa stain. Three fields per well were counted under a microscope. Angiomotin Is Localized on the Cell Surface—We have previously reported that MAE cells transfected with p80 angiomotin respond to angiostatin by inhibited migration and tube formation in vitro. This suggests that p80 angiomotin is a receptor for angiostatin. However, as judged by sequence analysis, angiomotin does not have an obvious signal peptide that could mediate the insertion of the protein into the membrane. To investigate whether p80 angiomotin has any extracellular domains, we incubated MAE cells stably expressing p80 angiomotin (p80 Amot MAE) with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, a biotin derivative with a reactive group that conjugates biotin to proteins. Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin is water-soluble and will not penetrate intact cell membranes. After incubation with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin we subjected cell lysates to immunoprecipitation against either angiomotin, or, as a negative control, the intracellular protein paxillin. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot with HRP-conjugated avidin. As seen in Fig. 1A, p80 angiomotin was biotinylated, whereas paxillin was not. Paxillin could, however, be biotinylated with a hydrophobic, membrane-permeating analogue, NHS-LC-biotin (data not shown). Endogenous p80 angiomotin could also be biotinylated in primary cells when similar experiments were carried out with bovine capillary endothelial (BCE) cells (supplementary Fig. S1). This is of interest, because angiostatin was first identified by its ability to inhibit proliferation of these cells (3O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3170) Google Scholar). To verify that angiomotin has extracellular epitopes we treated MAE cells with trypsin for various times and analyzed cell lysates by Western blot. Trypsin degraded most p80 angiomotin in 80 min, whereas actin, which is intracellular, was not (Fig. 1B). Longer exposure of the blot revealed the appearance over time of a degradation product that likely represents a protected fragment of the C terminus, suggesting that this domain is intracellular. Triton X-114 phase separation can be used to separate hydrophobic integral membrane proteins from hydrophilic soluble proteins. We carried out Triton X-114 fractionation of p80 Amot MAE cells. After phase separation p80 angiomotin could be detected in the aqueous fraction as well the detergent fraction, indicating that angiomotin is a integral membrane protein (Fig. 1C). VE-cadherin, a characterized transmembrane protein, also distributed to both fractions (data not shown). Angiostatin Binds Angiomotin on the Cell Surface—Previously we have shown that angiomotin-transfected HeLa cells can bind and internalize FITC-labeled angiostatin (10Troyanovsky B. Levchenko T.

https://openalex.org/W2076984061,"Protein kinase B (PKB) or Akt is one of several second messenger kinases that are activated by cell attachment and growth factor signaling, and that transmit signals to the cell nucleus to inhibit apoptosis and thereby increase cell survival during proliferation. Other viral proteins target this pathway by increasing PKB/Akt phosphorylation, and this pathway has been implicated in the transformation of human keratinocytes by HPV E6 and E7, together with activated notch 1. Here, we examine how HPV E7 expression affects the phosphorylation of PKB. We show that HPV-16 E7 increases the level of phosphorylation of PKB in response to serum stimulation, by a mechanism independent of downregulation of PTEN phosphatase, a known inhibitor of the PI3K (PI3 kinase) pathway. The use of specific antibodies shows that some proportion of PKB/Akt that is phosphorylated both on threonine 308 and serine 473 is maintained in the presence of E7 in a PI3 kinase-independent manner, and is activated for phosphorylation of BAD, a known downstream target of PKB/Akt. Use of E7 mutants has ruled out both an inhibition of IGFBP-3, a known E7 target and PKB/Akt modulator, and the interaction of E7 with cellular pocket proteins, as being the mechanism for the PKB/Akt stimulation. PKB binds PP2A and is a known substrate of PP2A. Here, we show that HPV E7 also binds to both the 35 kDa catalytic and 65 kDa structural subunits of PP2A, an interaction that sequesters these subunits and inhibits their interaction with PKB, thereby maintaining PKB/Akt signaling by inhibiting its dephosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2127769936,"Mutations in the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) gene account for almost 20% of patients with retinitis pigmentosa. Most mutations are detected in alternatively spliced RPGR-ORF15 isoform(s), which are primarily but not exclusively expressed in the retina. We show that, in addition to the axoneme, the RPGR-ORF15 protein is localized to the basal bodies of photoreceptor connecting cilium and to the tip and axoneme of sperm flagella. Mass spectrometric analysis of proteins that were immunoprecipitated from the retinal axoneme-enriched fraction using an anti-ORF15 antibody identified two chromosome-associated proteins, structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) 1 and SMC3. Using pulldown assays, we demonstrate that the interaction of RPGR with SMC1 and SMC3 is mediated, at least in part, by the RCC1-like domain of RPGR. This interaction was not observed with phosphorylation-deficient mutants of SMC1. Both SMC1 and SMC3 localized to the cilia of retinal photoreceptors and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, suggesting a broader physiological relevance of this interaction. Additional immunoprecipitation studies revealed the association of RPGR-ORF15 isoform(s) with the intraflagellar transport polypeptide IFT88 as well as microtubule motor proteins, including KIF3A, p150Glued, and p50-dynamitin. Inhibition of dynein function by overexpressing p50 abrogated the localization of RPGR-ORF15 to basal bodies. Taken together, these results provide novel evidence for the possible involvement of RPGR-ORF15 in microtubule organization and regulation of transport in primary cilia."
https://openalex.org/W1998460087,"To obtain insight into the mechanism of fibril formation, we examined the effects of ultrasonication, a strong agitator, on β2 -microglobulin (β2-m), a protein responsible for dialysis-related amyloidosis. Upon sonication of an acid-unfolded β2-m solution at pH 2.5, thioflavin T fluorescence increased markedly after a lag time of 1–2 h with a simultaneous increase of light scattering. Atomic force microscopy images showed the formation of a large number of short fibrils 3 nm in diameter. When the sonication-induced fibrils were used as seeds in the next seeding experiment at pH 2.5, a rapid and intense formation of long fibrils 3 nm in diameter was observed demonstrating seed-dependent fibril growth. We then examined the effects of sonication on the native β2-m at neutral pH, conditions under which amyloid deposits occur in patients. In the presence of 0.5 mm sodium dodecyl sulfate, a model compound of potential trigger and stabilizer of amyloid fibrils in patients, a marked increase of thioflavin T fluorescence was observed after 1 day of sonication at pH 7.0. The products of sonication caused the accelerated fibril formation at pH 7.0. Atomic force microscopy images showed that the fibrils formed at pH 7.0 have a diameter of more than 7 nm, thicker than those prepared at pH 2.5. These results indicate that ultrasonication is one form of agitation triggering the formation of amyloid fibrils of β2-m, producing fibrils adapted to the respective pH.

Amyloidosis results from the deposition of normally soluble proteins into insoluble amyloid fibrils: long, unbranched, and often twisted fibrillar structures a few nanometers in diameter and predominantly composed of cross β-sheets (1Rochet J.C.

Dialysis-related amyloidosis is a common and serious complication in patients receiving hemodialysis for more than 10 years (5Gejyo F. Kimura H. Suzuki S. Miyazaki R. Naiki H. Nakakuki K. Kidney Int.

Suppl. 2001; 78: S164-S171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β2-m, a typical immunoglobulin domain made of 99 residues, is present as the non-polymorphic light chain of the class I major histocompatibility complex (13Bjorkman P.J. Saper M.A. Samraoui B. Bennett W.S. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1987; 329: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (2766) Google Scholar). As part of its normal catabolic cycle, β2-m dissociates from the class I major histocompatibility complex and is transported in serum to the kidneys where the majority (95%) of it is degraded (6Floege J. Ketteler M. Kidney Int. Suppl. 2001; 78: S164-S171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Renal failure disrupts the clearance of β2-m from the serum, and moreover the β2-m does not pass through the dialysis membrane, resulting in an increase in the β2-m concentration by up to 50-fold in the blood circulation (6Floege J. Ketteler M. Kidney Int. Suppl. 2001; 78: S164-S171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By a mechanism that is currently not well understood, β2-m then self-associates to form amyloid fibrils under physiological conditions. The incubation of β2-m in vitro under acidic conditions in the presence or absence of seed fibrils results in the formation of high yields of amyloid fibrils with a range of different morphologies (7Naiki H.

Recently, Yamamoto et al. (14Yamamoto S. Hasegawa K. Yamaguchi I. Tsutsumi S. Kardos J. Goto Y. Gejyo F. Naiki H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11075-11082Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) found that low concentrations of SDS, around the critical micelle concentration (0.7 mm), not only stabilize fibrils but also induce extensive growth of β2-m amyloid fibrils at neutral pH. Moreover, Kihara et al. (15Kihara M. Chatani E. Sakai M. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12012-12018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) found that repeated self-seeding at pH 7.0 with fibrils formed at the same pH results in an acceleration of fibril growth, approaching the phenomenon that occurs under physiological conditions. It has been considered that amyloid fibril formation consists of nucleation and growth (1Rochet J.C. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Curr. Opin. Struct.

The nucleation process, in which a number of monomeric precursor molecules associate producing a minimal fibril unit, does not readily occur. Once the nucleus is formed, however, subsequent growth proceeds rapidly via the incorporation of the monomers into the ends of seed fibrils. These characteristics of amyloid fibril formation are similar to those of the crystal growth of substances, where agitation of solution often accelerates the nucleation process. Among various forms of agitation, shaking or stirring of the solution has been used widely to promote the formation of fibrils. While β2-m cannot form amyloid fibrils at pH 2.5 without seeding even after incubation for several days, agitation induced fibrils of β2-m to form in the absence of seeds (8Kad N.M. Myers S.L. Smith D.P. Smith D.A. Radford S.E. Thomson N.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Importantly, before the formation of β2-m fibrils, various kinds of amorphous or spherical aggregates were observed (8Kad N.M. Myers S.L. Smith D.P. Smith D.A. Radford S.E. Thomson N.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), suggesting that the agitation accelerates the formation of aggregates which then operate as a scaffold of fibril formation. Ultrasonication, usually used for preparing seeds from preformed fibrils, is another form of agitation that might affect the nucleation process. Although ultrasonication is widely used in medicine, industry, and research, little is known about its effects on proteins in solution. Recently, Stathopulos et al. (18Stathopulos P.B. Scholz G.A. Hwang Y.M. Rumfeldt J.A. Lepock J.R. Meiering E.M. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 3017-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) reported that, for various proteins, ultrasonication resulted in the formation of amyloid-like aggregates. They proposed that protein unfolding and aggregation are caused by the ultrasonication, leading to the formation of amyloid fibrils. Here, to obtain further insight into the mechanism of fibril formation, in particular the nucleation process, we examined the effects of ultrasonication on the monomeric β2-m. Expression and Purification of β2-m—Recombinant human β2-m was expressed with an Escherichia coli expression system and was purified as described previously (19Chiba T. Hagihara Y. Higurashi T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47016-47024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A Met residue was always present at the N-terminal position of the recombinant protein. Ultrasonication-induced Fibril Formation—A water bath-type ultrasonic transmitter with temperature controller (ELESTEIN SP070-PG-M, Elekon, Tokyo) was used to induce the formation of β2-m fibrils. The volume of the water bath was about 12 L. The frequency of the instrument was 17–20 kHz, and the power output was set to deliver a maximum of 350 watts. Reaction mixtures were ultrasonicated from three directions (i.e. two sides and bottom) for 1 min and then incubated for 9 min without sonication, a process that was repeated during incubation at 37 °C. The buffers used were 50 mm glycine-HCl (pH 2.5) containing 100 mm NaCl or 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 0.5 mm SDS and 100 mm NaCl. The concentration of β2-m monomer was 25 μm (0.3 mg/ml). The effects of ultrasonication were monitored by fluorometric analysis with ThT (7Naiki H. Hashimoto N. Suzuki S. Kimura H. Nakakuki K. Gejyo F. Amyloid. 1997; 4: 223-232Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar) using a Hitachi fluorescence spectrophotometer F4500 and a cell with a 10 mm light path. They were also monitored by light scattering at 350 nm with excitation at 350 nm at 25 °C using a cell with a 5-mm light path. For the light scattering measurements, the sample solution was diluted 2-fold with the reaction buffer. In the seeding experiments with the sonication-induced fibrils, sonicated β2-m fibrils were added at a final monomer concentration of 0.42 and 2.5 μm to the acidic and neutral pH reaction mixtures containing 25 μm β2-m, respectively, and the solutions were incubated at 37 °C without agitation. AFM Measurements—The sample solution was diluted 5-fold with water. A 50-μl diluted solution was spotted on freshly cleaved mica. After standing on the substrate for 1 min, the residual solution was blown off with compressed air. AFM images were obtained using a Nano Scope IIIa (Digital Instruments). The scanning tip used was a phosphorus (n)-doped Si. The scan rate was 0.5 Hz. CD Measurements—Far-UV CD spectra of β2-m fibrils were measured with a J-600 Jasco spectropolarimeter at 25 °C as described previously (19Chiba T. Hagihara Y. Higurashi T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47016-47024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) at a monomer concentration of 25 μm. Ultrasonication-induced Fibril Formation at Acidic pH—First, the same conditions as used for the standard seed-dependent fibril formation (i.e. 25 μm β2-m monomer in 50 mm glycine-HCl buffer (pH 2.5) containing 100 mm NaCl) (7Naiki H. Hashimoto N. Suzuki S. Kimura H. Nakakuki K. Gejyo F. Amyloid. 1997; 4: 223-232Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar) were used to examine the effects of ultrasonication. After preparing the reaction mixture in an Eppendorf tube on ice, ultrasonic treatment was started with the tube placed in the water bath at 37 °C. Repeated ultrasonication of 1 min in every 10 min induced, after a lag time of about 1 h, a sudden and remarkable increase in ThT fluorescence (Fig. 1a). The ThT fluorescence value (∼300) was much larger than that (∼200) of the standard seed-dependent fibril formation. AFM images of the solution at 3 h revealed substantial numbers of short fibrils (10–40 nm) about 3 nm in height (Fig. 1, b and d). The sonication-induced ThT increase was reproducible in terms of the overall shape of the kinetics and the final ThT intensity (Fig. 1a). However, the lag time varied slightly depending on the experiment and on the volume of the mixture in the tube, suggesting that the formation of fibrils critically depends on the sonication energy. In addition, the lag time depended on the protein concentration: the higher the concentration, the shorter the lag time (data not shown), consistent with the view that the nucleation process is an oligomeric reaction (20Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar, 21Ferrone F. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 256-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Seeding Reactions at Acidic pH—The seed-dependent extension of fibrils was examined at pH 2.5 using the sonication-induced short fibrils (i.e. the 1st generation of fibrils, F1) as seeds (Fig. 1a). It should be noted that the reaction was carried out without sonication. The ThT fluorescence increased dramatically without a lag phase, saturating at a markedly high value of about 500. AFM images revealed the formation of long and straight fibrils with a diameter of 3 nm (Fig. 1, c and e). The result demonstrates that the short F1 fibrils formed by sonication acted as seeds for subsequent growth, producing the second generation of fibrils (F2), a phenomenon characteristic of amyloid fibrils. The repeated seeding reactions produced the third and fourth generations of fibrils (F3 and F4, respectively) with essentially the same kinetics as the F2 fibrils (Fig. 1a) and with the same morphology measured by AFM (data not shown). Compared with the fibrils generated by the standard reaction with seeds originally from patients (22Katou H. Kanno T. Hoshino M. Hagihara Y. Tanaka H. Kawai T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2218-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1f), sonication-induced fibrils were thin (about one-fourth the diameter) and had no longitudinal periodicity. However, ThT fluorescence was more than 2-fold stronger in the sonication-induced fibrils than the standard fibrils. The CD spectra of sonication-induced β2-m fibrils (F1 and F2) exhibited a high content of β-sheet structure, similar to that of the standard fibrils at pH 2.5, indicating that the total amount of β-structure is similar between the two (Fig. 2a). These results suggest that thin fibrils have a larger number of ThT-binding sites because of the increased surface area in comparison with thick mature fibrils about 10 nm in diameter. It is conceivable that the sonication-induced fibrils correspond to the protofibrils of mature fibrils. It has been suggested that the morphology of fibrils can be propagated by seeding (23Chien P. DePace A.H. Collins S.R. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2003; 424: 948-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Yamaguchi K. Takahashi S. Kawai T. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar, 25Tanaka M. Chien P. Naber N. Cooke R. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2004; 428: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 26Dzwolak W. Smirnovas V. Jansen R. Winter R. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1927-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This was true for the sonication-induced fibrils, since the F3 and F4 fibrils had the same morphology and secondary structure as the F2 fibrils, i.e. inheritance of the fibril morphology. The observation that thin fibrils formed spontaneously suggests that the thin fibrils are more adapted to the acidic conditions. In accordance with this, we noticed that repeated seeding under standard conditions using seeds originally from patients tends to reduce the width of fibrils (data not shown). Absence of Large Aggregates—Kad et al. (8Kad N.M. Myers S.L. Smith D.P. Smith D.A. Radford S.E. Thomson N.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) published AFM images of stirring-induced β2-m amyloid fibrils under acidic conditions. The agitation made by the shaking or stirring of a solution is known to cause protein aggregation (27Bam N.B. Cleland J.L. Yang J. Manning M.C. Carpenter J.F. Kelley R.F. Randolph T.W. J. Pharm. Sci. 1998; 87: 1554-1559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 28Sluzky V. Tamada J.A. Klibanov A.M. Langer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9377-9381Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, Kad et al. (8Kad N.M. Myers S.L. Smith D.P. Smith D.A. Radford S.E. Thomson N.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) observed the formation of many large amorphous aggregates during a lag phase. Intriguingly, β2-m fibrils seemed to form using these large aggregates as a scaffold. To examine the possible participation of amorphous or spherical aggregates, the ultrasonication-induced fibril formation was further analyzed by simultaneously monitoring light scattering and AFM images (Fig. 3a). The kinetics measured based on light scattering and ThT fluorescence agreed with each other, indicating that no large aggregate that could not bind ThT was formed before the explosive fibril formation. The lag time of 120 min was longer than the lag time shown in Fig. 1. This is probably caused by the larger volume (2 ml) of solution used for the experiment in Fig. 3 than that (0.5 ml) for Fig. 1: the larger volume was necessary for a larger number of samples. Consistent with no increase in light scattering during the lag phase, AFM images showed no aggregates or oligomers until the late stage of the lag phase (Fig. 3b). Only dots with a diameter of 1.5–3 nm corresponding to monomeric or dimeric β2-m were observed at 0 and 60 min. Just before the abrupt increase of ThT fluorescence and light scattering (120 min), long and thin fibrils with a diameter of 3 nm were occasionally found. No large aggregate was observed even at this time point. After the explosive phase, large amounts of relatively long fibrils 100–200 nm in length were found (180 min). Then, the fibrils were fragmented to 10–40 nm by the continued ultrasonication of 1 min in every 10 min (240 min). Simultaneously, the light scattering intensity decreased, consistent with the non-linear relation between the size of aggregates and light scattering. On the other hand, since the value of ThT is independent of the length of fibrils, it did not change significantly after reaching a maximum. Thus, although ultrasonication has the same effect as shaking or stirring with respect to the formation of thin fibrils, the absence of observable aggregates is unique, suggesting that the large aggregates are not essential for amyloid fibril formation. Ultrasonication-induced Fibril Formation at Neutral pH—Although there are several reports of fibrils forming at neutral pH (29Esposito G. Michelutti R. Verdone G. Viglino P. Hernandez H.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7808-7815Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), most of them were qualitative and the number of fibrils formed is much smaller than that under acidic conditions. On the other hand, recent findings by Yamamoto et al. (14Yamamoto S. Hasegawa K. Yamaguchi I. Tsutsumi S. Kardos J. Goto Y. Gejyo F. Naiki H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11075-11082Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and Kihara et al. (15Kihara M. Chatani E. Sakai M. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12012-12018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) suggest that the extensive fibril formation under physiological conditions can be reproduced under certain conditions such as in the presence of 0.5 mm SDS. Here, we examined the effects of ultrasonication on monomeric β2-m at pH 7.0 in the presence of 0.5 mm SDS. It has been considered that low concentrations of SDS slightly destabilize the native structure of β2-m, leading to the formation of oligomers with increased amyloidogenecity (15Kihara M. Chatani E. Sakai M. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12012-12018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). At pH 7.0, the ThT fluorescence increased after a long lag time of about 30 h (Fig. 4a). The length of the lag phase varied slightly depending on the experiments. The presence of 0.5 mm SDS was essential. Since visible aggregates of proteins were often noted after the increase of ThT fluorescence, the time course of fibril formation was carefully monitored by light scattering. The time courses monitored by the two methods agreed with each other, and importantly, the light scattering intensities after the explosive phase were much higher than those at acidic pH (Fig. 5a). This indicates that, although no large aggregate is formed during the lag time, the sonication-induced fibrils at pH 7.0 have a higher propensity to form aggregates. AFM images right after the extension phase revealed the formation of thick fibrils more than 7 nm in diameter (Fig. 5b). There was some variation in the diameter of the fibrils, suggesting that thick fibrils are composed of several thin fibrils. Then, as expected from the light scattering measurements, continuous exposure of extended fibrils to ultrasonication caused further aggregation as monitored by AFM, producing numerous clumps of fibrils (Fig. 5c).FIGURE 5Examination of aggregation propensity of ultrasonication-induced β2-m fibril formation at pH 7.0.a, superposition of fibril formation kinetics monitored using ThT fluorescence (open circle) and light scattering (solid square). Although the light scattering intensity of fibrils was greater than that of pH 2.5 fibrils (Fig. 3a), no large aggregates were detected during the lag phase, indicating that the strong propensity to aggregate plays a role after the formation of fibrils. b, AFM image of the ultrasonication-induced F1 fibrils incubated for 43 h.

The final fluorescence intensity of F2 fibrils was about 200, which is evidently less than that of the sonication-induced F1 fibrils at pH 7.0. The kinetics of fibril formation at pH 7.0 was similar to that of the neutral-pH adapted fibrils as reported by Kihara et al. (15Kihara M. Chatani E. Sakai M. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12012-12018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar): repeated seeding at pH 7.0 starting with low pH-adapted fibrils produced neutral pH-adapted fibrils with a relatively fast rate of fibril growth (Fig. 4b). Further self-seeding producing F2, F3, and F4 fibrils gave similar kinetics of fibril growth. However, the final ThT fluorescence value tended to decrease, suggesting the propensity of fibrils to aggregate under the experimental conditions at pH 7.0 (Fig. 4b). AFM images of F2 fibrils at pH 7.0 often showed associated and clumped fibrils in which the respective fibrils are more than 7 nm in diameter (Fig. 5d), similar to F1 fibrils (Fig. 5b). The CD spectrum of the sonication-induced F1 fibrils at pH 7.0 was similar to that of the neutral pH-adapted fibrils (Fig. 2b), indicating that the two type of fibrils are indistinguishable with respect to the β-sheet content. Ultrasonication-induced Fibril Formation—There are various effects of ultrasonication on protein solutions, which have been nicely reviewed by Stathopulos et al. (18Stathopulos P.B. Scholz G.A. Hwang Y.M. Rumfeldt J.A. Lepock J.R. Meiering E.M. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 3017-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Briefly, air bubbles are generated in solution by an effect called cavitation and are then crushed by the surrounding solvent. This causes a violent collision of the solvent, creating an extremely high local temperature. Proteins may be destabilized and unfolded at the air-liquid interface of sonication-induced bubbles. It is likely that partially folded intermediates are induced. Reduction in a size of large molecules, increase of the fluid velocity, and generation of free radicals are also caused by ultrasonication (34Yu T. Wang Z. Mason T.J. Ultrason. Sonochem. 2004; 11: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 35Mason T.J. Ultrason. Sonochem. 2003; 10: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 36Gupta M.N. Roy I. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Additionally, the aggregation of unfolded or destabilized proteins may be enhanced. There is a report that prion protein fragments compress at the air-water interface and form a stable β-sheet (37Satheeshkumar K.S. Jayakumar R. Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2002; 19: 2244-2245Crossref Google Scholar). Altogether, ultrasonication exerts two opposing effects on proteins. One is the effect of breaking protein aggregates as occurs during the fragmentation of fibrils to make seeds. This effect has been successfully applied to the replication of infectious prion proteins by dividing infectious prion aggregates into many seeds and extending these seeds via template-dependent growth (38Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C. Nature. 2001; 411: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 39Castilla J. Saa P. Hetz C. Soto C. Cell. 2005; 121: 195-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The other effect is to promote aggregation by increasing the frequency of collisions between unfolded or destabilized protein molecules. These effects of ultrasonication seem similar to the agitation induced by shaking or stirring of the solution, leading to the formation of amorphous aggregates before fibril form (8Kad N.M. Myers S.L. Smith D.P. Smith D.A. Radford S.E. Thomson N.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, an important difference is that the combination of the two effects of sonication minimizes the size of aggregates. In our experiments, no appreciable aggregate was detected by AFM before the abrupt increase in ThT fluorescence and light scattering at pH 2.5 or 7.0. Nevertheless, we believe that small aggregates of denatured proteins detected by neither AFM nor light scattering are induced by ultrasonication. Among these small aggregates, a unique amyloidogenic conformation, which plays the role of a template in fibril growth, may emerge. Once the growth of fibrils has started as shown in Fig. 3b (120 min), ultrasonication-induced fragmentation amplifies the number of seed fibrils. Consequently, after a certain lag time, explosive fibril formation occurs as is evident from the ThT fluorescence and light scattering intensities as well as AFM images (Figs. 1 and 3). Our results suggest that large amorphous or spherical aggregates are not necessarily required for the formation of fibrils if the corresponding conformational templates exist in small oligomers. Additionally, it has been known that amyloidogenic proteins can form several kinds of fibrils of different morphologies. The β2-m fibrils formed by the stirring of a solution at pH 2.5 consist of a mixture of fibrils distinct in diameter and morphology (8Kad N.M. Myers S.L. Smith D.P. Smith D.A. Radford S.E. Thomson N.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In contrast, the fibrils induced by ultrasonication at pH 2.5 were fairly homogeneous with a diameter of 3 nm, suggesting that only the fibrils of the lowest free energy are produced and expanded because ultrasonication destroys unstable fibrils. Difference between Fibrils at pH 7 and pH 2.5—Amyloid fibril formation under neutral pH conditions is one of the most focused issues for understanding the pathology of dialysis-related amyloidosis. Ultrasonication indeed induced β2-m fibrils to form at pH 7, where a low concentration (0.5 mm) of SDS was required and the reaction was slower than that at pH 2.5. Although the diameter (∼7 nm) of fibrils formed at pH 7 is greater than that (∼3 nm) at pH 2.5, approaching the ∼10 nm fibrils deposited in patients (22Katou H. Kanno T. Hoshino M. Hagihara Y. Tanaka H. Kawai T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2218-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the fibril extension reaction was much slower than that at pH 2.5. Even at neutral pH, no large aggregate was detected by light scattering before the explosive increase in ThT fluorescence (Fig. 5a). However, unlike under acidic conditions, the fragmentation of fibrils after their formation did not take place at the same level of ultrasonication (Fig. 5, b and c). In contrast, the fibrils aggregated with time. We consider that the difference between pH 2.5 and 7.0 is partly explained by the difference of net charge. The pI value of β2-m is ∼6, and the net charge at pH 2.5 and 7.0 is +17 and –3, respectively; while the positive charge repulsion is large at pH 2.5, it is small at pH 7.0. Because of the decreased net change at pH 7.0, thick fibrils made of several protofilaments and moreover the clusters of thick fibrils may form at pH 7.0, eventually leading to visible aggregates. The sonication-induced protofibrils at pH 2.5 are well dispersed taking advantage of the high net charge repulsion. On the other hand, 0.5 mm SDS was necessary at pH 7.5. While β2-m assumes the monomeric native structure, it is acid-unfolded at pH 2.5. These results indicate that additional factors other than net charge are also responsible for the difference between fibrils at pH 7 and pH 2.5. Since amyloid fibrils are ordered aggregates, they can be induced to form under conditions which promote general protein aggregation. It has been considered that high hydrophobicity, high β-sheet propensity, and low net charge are important factors for fibril formation (40Lopez De La Paz M. Goldie K. Zurdo J. Lacroix E. Dobson C.M. Hoenger A. Serrano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16052-16057Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). High correlations of these factors with the rate of aggregation were revealed in mutation experiments using human muscle acylphosphatase (41Chiti F. Calamai M. Taddei N. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16419-16426Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 42Chiti F. Stefani M. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 424: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Moreover, partial or global unfolding of protein is an additional important factor (4Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1698: 131-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). β2-m has comparatively high hydrophobicity and high β-sheet propensity, and its pI value is ∼6. With respect to these factors, β2-m has an intrinsic potential to form amyloid fibrils under physiological conditions. However, the native fold definitively prevents the formation (43Ohhashi Y. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10814-10821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although high hydrophobicity and low net charge are important factors, too much of these factors results in the formation of amorphous aggregates (44Raman B. Chatani E. Kihara M. Ban T. Sakai M. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Rao Ch M. Goto Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1288-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Potential Risk of Ultrasonication—Finally, in medicine, ultrasonication is widely used for soft tissue imaging because of its perceived safety, non-invasiveness, and low cost (45Feril L.B. Kondo T. J. Radiat. Res. (Tokyo). 2004; 45: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). It has also been used therapeutically in surgical ophthalmology, physical therapy, and cancer therapy (46Beerlage H.P. Thuroff S. Debruyne F.M. Chaussy C. de la Rosette J.J. Urology. 1999; 54: 273-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Many studies have been performed on ultrasonication-induced damage to living cells. It was reported that ultrasonication induces apoptosis and the formation of free radicals in cells (45Feril L.B. Kondo T. J. Radiat. Res. (Tokyo). 2004; 45: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 47Ashush H. Rozenszajn L.A. Blass M. Barda-Saad M. Azimov D. Radnay J. Zipori D. Rosenschein U. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1014-1020PubMed Google Scholar, 48Riesz P. Kondo T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992; 13: 247-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 49Feril Jr., L.B. Kondo T. Takaya K. Riesz P. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 2004; 80: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Practical medical treatments using ultrasonication are performed under conditions that suppress such damage. While it can be envisaged that ultrasoncation is useful for dissolving protein aggregates and deposits, the present results as well as those of Stathopulos et al. (18Stathopulos P.B. Scholz G.A. Hwang Y.M. Rumfeldt J.A. Lepock J.R. Meiering E.M.

The relation between medical treatment using ultrasonication and amyloidosis is not reported. Although the high power ultrasonic wave used in this research is not physiologically relevant, it will be important to examine the influence of ultrasonication on proteins in the living body with respect to protein aggregation and possible amyloid formation.

https://openalex.org/W2005610717,"Human innate immunity to non-pathogenic species of African trypanosomes is provided by human high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. Here we show that native human HDLs containing haptoglobin-related protein (Hpr), apolipoprotein L-I (apoL-I) and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) are the principle antimicrobial molecules providing protection from trypanosome infection. Other HDL subclasses containing either apoA-I and apoL-I or apoA-I and Hpr have reduced trypanolytic activity, whereas HDL subclasses lacking apoL-I and Hpr are non-toxic to trypanosomes. Highly purified, lipid-free Hpr and apoL-I were both toxic to Trypanosoma brucei brucei but with specific activities at least 500-fold less than those of native HDLs, suggesting that association of these apolipoproteins within the HDL particle was necessary for optimal cytotoxicity. These studies show that HDLs can serve as platforms for the assembly of multiple synergistic proteins and that these assemblies may play a critical role in the evolution of primate-specific innate immunity to trypanosome infection.

The best understood of these is the ability of HDL to protect against atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease by promoting the efflux of excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues and its subsequent transport to the liver for excretion. In addition, apolipoproteins and enzymes carried by HDL have antioxidant activities that inhibit the oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein (LDL), thereby reducing the atherogenicity of these lipoproteins. A less well known activity of HDL is an antimicrobial property that protects some primates from infection by certain eukaryotic pathogens. In these primate species, HDL apolipoproteins have been proposed to have novel innate immune protective functions that provide selective protection against infection. One such innate immune activity in the serum of humans, apes, and old world monkeys limits the host range of Trypanosoma brucei brucei to non-primate mammals (1Seed J.R. Sechelski J.B. Loomis M.R. J. Protozool. 1990; 37: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This activity fractionates with a minor subclass of human HDL termed trypanosome lytic factor 1 (TLF-1) that, like all HDLs, is composed of apolipoproteins, phospholipids, and neutral lipids (2Rifkin M.R.

Two HDL-associated proteins have been implicated in the toxicity of TLF-1, haptoglobin-related protein (Hpr) and apolipoprotein L-I (apoL-I) (12Smith A.B. Esko J.D. Hajduk S.L.

Haptoglobin-related protein differs by only 27 amino acids from human haptoglobin, an acute phase serum protein that binds hemoglobin released from red blood cells during trauma or infection and transfers the hemoglobin to liver cells for detoxification (14Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6698-6709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bowman B.H. Bowman B.H. Hepatic Plasma Proteins. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1993: 159-167Google Scholar). However, Hpr does not bind hemoglobin, and its physiological function is unknown (9Bishop J.R. Shimamura M. Hajduk S.L. Mol. Biochem.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3884-3887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The role of Hpr in T. b. brucei killing was initially proposed based on its fractionation with TLF-1 and its presence in lipid-deficient human serum fractions that also contain trypanosome killing activity (TLF-2) (12Smith A.B.

Additionally, the Hpr gene evolved during primate evolution and is present in all primate species with trypanolytic sera. An apparent exception is the chimpanzee, which have the Hpr gene but lack trypanolytic sera and are susceptible to infection by T. b. brucei. When chimp sera were tested for the presence of Hpr none was detectable, indicating that although chimps retain the Hpr gene they lack Hpr in their serum (19Lugli E.B. Pouliot M. Portela M.P.M. Loomis M.R. Raper J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 138: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Another primate-specific protein, apoL-I, has recently been shown to possess cytotoxic activity against T. b. brucei. ApoL-I is a member of a multi-gene family on human chromosome 22 consisting of APOLI-APOLVI (20Duchateau P.N. Rullinger C.R. Orellana R.E. Kunitake S.T. Naya-Vigne J. O'Connor P.M. Malloy M.J.

The APOL-I, APOL-II, APOL-III, and APOL-IV genes form a distinct cluster and may be the result of recent tandem gene duplications. Comparative sequence analysis indicates that the APOL-V-APOL-VI cluster is distinct and has a different origin (23Monajemi H. Fontijn R.D. Pannekoek H. Horrevoets A.J.G. Genomics. 2002; 79: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Consistent with this view, the APOL-I-APOL-IV cluster is only detected in primates (21Page N.M. Butlin D.J. Lomthaisong K.

ApoL-I was initially isolated from normal human serum as a full-length 42-kDa protein and a 38-kDa truncation product, both of which are found associated with large HDL particles (20Duchateau P.N.

Based on its proposed structure, apoL-1 has been suggested to function as a catalyst for lipid transfer, although this activity has not been demonstrated (20Duchateau P.N. Rullinger C.R.

ApoL-I is expressed in a wide range of tissues, and apoL-I mRNA is most abundant in lung, pancreas, liver, placenta, and spleen (22Duchateau P.N. Pullinger C.R. Cho M.H. Eng C. Kane J.P. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 620-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with purified apoL-I from human serum and recombinant apoL-I expressed in mammalian cells have shown that apoL-I kills T. b. brucei (13Vanhamme L. Paturiaux-Hanocq F. Poelvoorde P. Nolan D.P. Lins L. Van Den Abbeele J. Pays A. Tebabi P. Van Xong H. Jacquet A. Moguilevsky N. Dieu M. Kane J.P. De Baetselier P. Brasseur R. Pays E. Nature. 2003; 422: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). A role for apoL-I in T. b. brucei killing was supported both by the lack of apoL-I in the serum of chimpanzees, which are susceptible to T. b. brucei, and its presence in the serum of gorillas, which are resistant to T. b. brucei. However, other T. b. brucei-resistant primates such as the baboon and the sooty mangabey do not contain apoL-I in their serum, although Hpr is present (19Lugli E.B. Pouliot M. Portela M.P.M. Loomis M.R. Raper J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 138: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 24Poelvoorde P. Vanhamme L. Van Den Abbeele J. Switzer W.M. Pays E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 134: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These inconsistencies have led us to re-investigate the role of Hpr and apoL-1 in T. b. brucei killing. In the studies reported here we show that Hpr and apoL-I assemble into the same native human HDL particle, that purified apoL-I and Hpr are both T. b. brucei-specific toxins, and that assembly of these proteins into the same HDL particle resulted in a synergistic increase in trypanolytic activity. Our results suggest that HDL assembly and remodeling play important roles in the formation of multi-component assemblages in the circulation that may accentuate innate immune protection against infectious agents. Purification of Human HDLs and Apolipoproteins—Human HDLs were purified by differential flotation on sodium bromide gradients as described previously (3Hajduk S.L. Moore D.R. Vasudevacharya J. Siqueira H. Torri A.F. Tytler E.M. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5210-5217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, normal human blood was obtained from healthy fasted donors, and serum was immediately separated from blood cells by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 9,500 rpm in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. The serum was adjusted to 0.5 mm EDTA, and density was adjusted to 1.063 g/ml by the addition of sodium bromide. Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL were removed by centrifugation at 18 °C for 23 h at 50,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti70 rotor. HDL was sequentially isolated by adjusting the LDL-deficient serum to 1.26 g/ml followed by centrifugation at 18 °C for 42 h at 50,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti70 rotor. The HDL-containing float was diluted with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3 mm EDTA (PBSE) and dialyzed against PBSE to remove the sodium bromide. These total human HDLs were then fractionated by immunoaffinity absorption with anti-Hpr or anti-apoL-I. Bound HDL fractions were washed with PBSE, eluted using 100 mm glycine at pH 2.0, and immediately neutralized by the addition of 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5). A fraction of HDL was identified that was deficient in both apoL-I and Hpr after sequential immunoaffinity selection with anti-Hpr and anti-apoL-I columns. This unbound fraction of HDL represented >99% of the starting HDL and lacked trypanolytic activity. All HDL fractions were characterized by in vitro T. b. brucei lysis assays and Western blots. For purification of apolipoproteins, total human HDLs were first solubilized in PBSE by the addition of either deoxycholate or CHAPS to a final concentration of 10 mm. Individual apolipoproteins were immunoaffinity purified by anti-Hpr or anti-apoL-I column chromatography. Purity of apolipoprotein fractions was determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described (3Hajduk S.L. Moore D.R. Vasudevacharya J. Siqueira H. Torri A.F. Tytler E.M. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5210-5217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies and Affinity Columns—Antibodies used in these studies were either purchased commercially (anti-apo-B, anti-apoA-I, and anti-haptoglobin from Sigma; anti-apoL-I (anti-apoL-I (1) in Fig. 1B) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or were prepared by hyperimmunization of mice with purified human TLF and the production of hybridoma cell lines expressing monoclonal antibodies against apoL-I (anti-apoL-I (2) in Fig. 1B) and Hpr (3Hajduk S.L.

Affi-gel 10 (Bio-Rad) was used as described by the manufacturer to couple purified fractions of monoclonal anti-apoL-I and anti-Hpr to make affinity chromatography columns. Trypanosome Lysis Assays—Trypanosome lysis was evaluated by phase-contrast microscopy following the incubation of T. b. brucei clonal cell line IlTat 1.3 for 2 h at 37°Cinthe presence of either purified HDLs or individual apolipoproteins. For antibody inhibition studies, 15 μg of the indicated antibody or sera was included. For assays with individual apolipoproteins, 15 μg of anti-apoL-I was added to Hpr assays, and 15 μg of anti-Hpr was added to apoL-I assays. Each lysis assay contained 3 × 106 trypanosomes in 300 μl of assay buffer. Results presented in this paper were from samples assayed in triplicate, and S.E. is indicated. Methods for the purification of trypanosomes, standard lysis assay conditions, and the specificity of this assay for T. b. brucei have been described previously (3Hajduk S.L. Moore D.R. Vasudevacharya J. Siqueira H. Torri A.F. Tytler E.M. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5210-5217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mixing and Reconstitution Experiments—For the mixing of Hpr and apoL-I without reconstitution, 2.5 μg of purified Hpr and 0.75 μg of purified apoL-I were incubated together in the presence of 5 μg/ml inactive human HDLs for 3 min on ice prior to the addition of trypanosomes and incubation at 37 °C for 2.5 h. For reconstitution, inactive human HDLs at 10 μg/ml were incubated with 12.5 μg of purified Hpr, 2.5 μg of purified apoL-I or 12.5 μg of Hpr plus 2.5 μg apoL-I (5:1) in the presence of 10 mm sodium deoxycholate. Detergent concentration was reduced to 0.08 pm by dialysis to allow particles to re-form (25Jonas A. Segrest J.P. Albers J.J. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1986: 553-582Google Scholar, 26Tytler E.M. Moore D.R. Pierce M.A. Hager K.M. Esko J.D. Hajduk S.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 69: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Reconstituted HDL samples (1 μg) were tested in standard lysis assays as described. Reconstituted particles were characterized by affinity chromatography using anti-Hpr and anti-apoL-I, and the efficiency of apoL-I and Hpr reconstitution into an HDL particle was evaluated by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Radioiodination and Binding of HDL Subclasses—The different HDL subclasses were purified as described above. Each subclass was radiolabeled with 1 mCi of 125I using 1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-3α,6α-diphenlylgly-couril (Iodogen) as the catalyst (Sigma). Labeled HDLs were separated from unincorporated 125I by filtration on PD-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences). SDS-PAGE gels and autoradiography confirmed incorporation of the label with the apolipoproteins. Labeled HDL was added at the indicated concentrations to T. b. brucei, 3 × 107/ml, in F12 media containing 5% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 4 °C for 16 h (6Drain J. Bishop J.R. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30254-30260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Incubations included a 100-fold excess of unlabeled, nonlytic human HDLs (Hpr- and apoL-I-deficient fraction of the total HDL) to compete for general HDL binding. Cells were washed three times with PBSE, and the amount of bound HDL was measured by scintillation counting. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry and Sample Preparation—Highly purified TLF was prepared by sequential flotation on sodium bromide gradients followed by immunoaffinity purification with anti-Hpr. Samples were separated under non-reducing conditions on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and destained with 20% isopropanol and 5% methanol, and protein bands were manually excised for MALDI-TOF analysis. Gel pieces were macerated and washed with 50% aqueous acetonitrile to remove SDS, salts, and stain, dried to remove solvent, rehydrated in a solution containing trypsin (12 ng/μl; Roche Applied Science), and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Tryptic peptides were recovered, concentrated with a Centricon device (Millipore), and desalted using a Zip-Tip (Millipore), and peptides were eluted with acetonitrile. Samples were spotted onto a gold target plate for MALDI-TOF analysis using a PE-Biosystems Voyager Elite instrument (Framingham, MA). Peptide peaks were submitted for analysis with publicly available “Mascot” software (www.matrixscience.com). Previous studies have shown that the majority of trypanosome killing activity in human serum fractionates with HDLs (2Rifkin M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3450-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 3Hajduk S.L. Moore D.R. Vasudevacharya J. Siqueira H. Torri A.F. Tytler E.M. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5210-5217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have presented evidence that a minor subclass of HDL containing Hpr was trypanolytic, whereas others have shown that apoL-I is toxic to T. b. brucei (12Smith A.B. Esko J.D. Hajduk S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 13Vanhamme L. Paturiaux-Hanocq F. Poelvoorde P. Nolan D.P. Lins L. Van Den Abbeele J. Pays A. Tebabi P. Van Xong H. Jacquet A. Moguilevsky N. Dieu M. Kane J.P. De Baetselier P. Brasseur R. Pays E. Nature. 2003; 422: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). These apparently disparate findings were initially investigated by testing the ability of antibodies raised against apoA-I, Hpr, and apoL-I to neutralize trypanosome killing. Antibodies against these apolipoproteins were incubated with total human HDL, and the specificity of each antibody was shown by Western blotting (Fig. 1A). Each of the antibodies showed a characteristic inhibition of trypanosome lysis by human HDLs (Fig. 1B). Even at high antibody concentrations (data not shown) we failed to observe complete inhibition of trypanosome lytic activity using only a single antibody against Hpr or apoL-I. This suggested that multiple toxins might be present in the human HDL preparation. Inhibition of lysis by anti-apoA-I was expected, because apoA-I is a ubiquitous component of all HDL particles. However, it is unlikely that apo A-I is the active toxin for trypanosomes in HDLs because previous studies using both purified human apoA-I and recombinant apoA-I have shown that alone it lacks the ability to lyse trypanosomes (26Tytler E.M. Moore D.R. Pierce M.A. Hager K.M. Esko J.D. Hajduk S.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 69: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 27Rifkin M.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1991; 72: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, >99% of the total human serum apoA-I is associated with HDLs that lack trypanolytic activity (28Raper J. Portela M.P.M. Redpath M. Tomlinson S. Lugli E. Green H. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2002; 96: 145-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies to proteins absent from lytic HDLs, such as apolipoprotein B, the major protein component of LDL particles, did not inhibit trypanosome lysis (Fig. 1B). Based on these results we focused on the potential role of both Hpr and apoL-I as active toxins to T. b. brucei. Because both Hpr and apoL-I have been implicated as toxins to T. b. brucei, the relative killing activity of these apolipoproteins was evaluated. We immunoaffinity purified Hpr and apoL-I from detergent-solubilized human HDLs and tested their activity in trypanosome lysis assays (Fig. 2). The purity of the fractions was determined by Coomassie staining and Western blotting (Fig. 2, A–C). The Hpr fraction contained no detectable apoL-I, whereas the apoL-I fraction contained a trace amount of Hpr (Fig. 2, A and B). The apoL-I- and Hpr-depleted fraction contained predominantly apoA-I, apolipoprotein A-II, and albumin by Coomassie and Western blotting (Fig. 2C). Purified Hpr and apoL-I were tested for trypanosome lytic activity (Fig. 2D). Trypanosomes incubated with increasing concentrations of purified Hpr or apoL-I were killed in a dose-dependent manner with specific activities of 0.10 units/μg and 0.14 units/μg, respectively (TABLE ONE). The apoL-I- and Hpr-depleted fraction, containing all other proteins present in human HDLs, had no lytic activity. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that Hpr and apoL-I are both toxic to T. b. brucei and account for all lytic activity observed in human serum HDLs.TABLE ONETrypanolytic activity of purified Hpr and apoL-I, reconstituted HDL subclasses, and native HDL subclassesProteinSpecific activityRecovered activityRecovered activityμgunits/μgunits%Purified apolipoproteinaApolipoproteins purified from HDLs as described in the Fig. 2 legend.Hpr5620.105675.7ApoL-I1300.141824.3Reconstituted HDL subclassbReconstituted HDL subclasses all contained 10 μg of non-lytic human HDL and the following amounts of purified apolipoproteins: 12.5 μg of purified Hpr and 2.5 μg of purified apoL-I (5:1 ratio) for apoA-I/Hpr/apoL-I; 12.5 μg of Hpr for apoA-I/Hpr; and 2.5 μg of apoL-I for apoA-I/ApoL-I.ApoA-I/Hpr/ApoL-I1.10ApoA-I/Hpr0.24ApoA-I/ApoL-I0.28Native HDL subclasscApolipoproteins as described in the Fig. 5 legend.ApoA-I/Hpr/ApoL-I33083.3dA lytic unit is defined as the amount of protein needed to lyse 50% of the trypanosomes in a standard lysis assay following a 2-h incubation at 37 °C (3).27,49899.3eRecovered activity was calculated from total activity purified from a unit of blood.ApoA-I/Hpr2400.5dA lytic unit is defined as the amount of protein needed to lyse 50% of the trypanosomes in a standard lysis assay following a 2-h incubation at 37 °C (3).1150.4eRecovered activity was calculated from total activity purified from a unit of blood.ApoA-I/ApoL-I1160.8dA lytic unit is defined as the amount of protein needed to lyse 50% of the trypanosomes in a standard lysis assay following a 2-h incubation at 37 °C (3).890.3eRecovered activity was calculated from total activity purified from a unit of blood.ApoA-I2.51e50.0dA lytic unit is defined as the amount of protein needed to lyse 50% of the trypanosomes in a standard lysis assay following a 2-h incubation at 37 °C (3).00.0eRecovered activity was calculated from total activity purified from a unit of blood.a Apolipoproteins purified from HDLs as described in the Fig. 2 legend.b Reconstituted HDL subclasses all contained 10 μg of non-lytic human HDL and the following amounts of purified apolipoproteins: 12.5 μg of purified Hpr and 2.5 μg of purified apoL-I (5:1 ratio) for apoA-I/Hpr/apoL-I; 12.5 μg of Hpr for apoA-I/Hpr; and 2.5 μg of apoL-I for apoA-I/ApoL-I.c Apolipoproteins as described in the Fig. 5 legend.d A lytic unit is defined as the amount of protein needed to lyse 50% of the trypanosomes in a standard lysis assay following a 2-h incubation at 37 °C (3Hajduk S.L.

Open table in a new tab Although our analysis of purified Hpr and apoL-I indicated that both are toxins, we observed a significant reduction in lytic activity as compared with native HDL particles. The purified proteins have specific activities ∼600–800-fold less than those of native HDLs, indicating that maximal activity may require assembly into an HDL particle or a possible synergistic interaction between the two proteins. We first assayed mixtures of purified Hpr and apoL-I (3:1 molar ratio) in trypanosome lysis assays and found only an additive increase in trypanosome killing (Fig. 2E and TABLE ONE). These results suggested that assembly of Hpr and apoL-I into an HDL particle may be required for maximal trypanolytic activity. To test this possibility we used conditions established previously for the reconstitution of HDLs (25Jonas A. Segrest J.P. Albers J.J. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1986: 553-582Google Scholar, 26Tytler E.M. Moore D.R. Pierce M.A. Hager K.M. Esko J.D. Hajduk S.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 69: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Hpr and apoL-I were reconstituted with nonlytic human HDL at a molar ratio of 5:1, mimicking the ratio of Hpr to apoL-I seen in HDL. Reconstituted particles containing only Hpr or apoL-I had specific activities of 0.24 units/μg or 0.28 units/μg, respectively, whereas particles containing both Hpr and apoL-I showed an ∼5-fold increase in specific trypanosome killing activity to 1.10 units/μg (Fig. 2E and TABLE ONE). These findings demonstrate that the assembly of Hpr and apoL-I into the same HDL particle results in enhanced killing of T. b. brucei. This observation suggested that native HDL subclasses containing both Hpr and apoL-I likely have a high specific activity for T. b. brucei killing and play a major role in human innate protection from trypanosome infection. We therefore decided to fractionate native HDLs into subclasses containing either Hpr or apoL-I or both proteins and to examine the lytic activity of these native HDL particles. Human HDL was initially fractionated into Hpr-containing and Hpr-depleted particles by immunoabsorption with anti-Hpr. Analysis of the Hpr-containing HDLs by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and Western blot identified apoA-I, apoA-II, apoL-I, and Hpr as components of this subfraction of human HDL (Fig. 3, A and B, TABLE TWO, and Fig. 4A). The unambiguous identification of Hpr and apoL-I was complicated, because both proteins are encoded by multi-gene families in humans. Hpr was distinguished from human haptoglobin based on detection of three tryptic fragments unique to"

https://openalex.org/W2101023638,"Inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) suppresses apoptosis through binding and inhibiting active caspases-3, -7 and -9 via its baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domains. During apoptosis the caspase inhibition by IAPs can be negatively regulated by a mitochondrial protein second mitochondrial-derived activator of caspase (Smac). Smac physically interacts with multiple IAPs and relieves their inhibitory effect on caspases-3, -7 and -9. Recently, a small molecule Smac-mimic compound (Smac-mimic), which potentiates TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha mediated cell death in glioblastoma T98G cells and HeLa cells, was identified and characterized. To determine the efficacy of this compound in breast cancer cells, we first measured protein expression of three IAPs: XIAP, cIAP-1, and cIAP-2 in nine independent breast cancer cell lines. Three cell lines were chosen: a high IAPs expressing line MDA-MB-231, and two low IAPs expressing lines, T47D and MDA-MB-453. The cell lines were tested for their sensitivity to Smac-mimic alone or in combination with TRAIL or etoposide. Acting alone, Smac-mimic was quite potent with a cytotoxic IC50 of 3.8 nM in high IAPs expressing MDA-MB-231 cells, but was inactive at a much higher concentration in low IAPs expressing T47D and MDA-MB-453 cells. In fact, as low as 2.5 nM of Smac-mimic alone was sufficient to activate caspase-3 and induce apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. In combinational treatments with TRAIL or etoposide, Smac-mimic significantly sensitized cells to growth suppression in MDA-MB-231 cells, but to a lesser extent in T47D and MDA-MB-453 cells. Furthermore, it significantly synergized MDA-MB-231, but not T47D cells to apoptosis induced by either TRAIL or etoposide. Thus, in these cell lines, Smac-mimic acts in an apparent IAPs dependent manner to induce apoptosis alone as well as sensitizes breast cancer cells to TRAIL or etoposide induced apoptosis via caspase-3 activation."

Similarly, cAMP shifts the membrane potential for activation to a larger extent for HCN2 and HCN4 than for HCN1. cAMP modulation is mediated by direct binding of cAMP to a cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) located in the intracellular C terminus, thereby releasing the inhibitory effect of this C terminus on channel activation (13Stieber J.

Expression of the murine HCN3 in HEK293 cells or similar systems resulted in very small and unstable currents. Only recently, expression of the murine HCN3 channel was improved by using a lentiviral-based approach (16Mistrik P. Mader R. Michalakis S. Weidinger M. Pfeifer A. Biel M. J. Biol.

Thus, information about the basic biophysical and pharmacological properties of HCN3 channels, in comparison to the other HCN channels, is limited (5Santoro B. Liu D.T. Yao H. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R.

Stable expression of hHCN3 in HEK293 cells allowed a more detailed characterization of this HCN channel and comparison to the other three human HCN subtypes. hHCN3/hHCN4 chimeric channels contributed to the understanding of how cAMP modulates HCN channels. Cloning of cDNAs Coding for HCN Channels—Human HCN3 cDNA was cloned from whole human brain QUICK-Clone cDNA (Clontech) using an overlapping PCR strategy. Two cDNA fragments were amplified using the primer pairs hHCN3f1 (5′-CTAGGAGGCCGAGCGTGTAAGCGGGGT-3′)/hHCN3r1 (5′-AGTCCCTGGACTCTTCCCGGCGTCAGT-3′) and hHCN3f2 (5′-GCCACGGCACTCATCCAGTCCCTGGAC-3′)/hHCN3r2 (5′-AACATGTAAAACCTTTGAGTACATCCA-3′). The two fragments with 1.1 and 1.3 kilobases, respectively, were ligated via the PflMI restriction site and cloned into the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). The human HCN1 cDNA was cloned from the same source. The sequences of the primer pairs were hHCN1f1 (5′-GGGCATGGAAGGAGGCGGCAA-3′)/hHCN1r1 (5′-AGGCGGCAGTATCAAGAGAAG-3′) and hHCN1f2 (5′-CACCTGCTATGCCATGTTTGT-3′)/hHCN1r2 (5′-TTGTCAAAGCAGAAAGAAATAC-3′). The two fragments, with 1.2 and 1.5 kilobases, respectively, were ligated via the PflMI restriction site and cloned into the pcDNA3 vector. The identity of hHCN1 and hHCN3 clones was verified by DNA sequencing and comparing the sequence to the sequences accessible in the human genome data base (for accession numbers, see Supplement Table S1). Human HCN2 and HCN4 cDNAs were originally cloned from the atrioventricular node region of a human heart (9Ludwig A. Zong X. Stieber J. Hullin R. Hofmann F. Biel M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2323-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector. Murine HCN3 cDNA was originally cloned from mouse brain (7Ludwig A. Zong X. Jeglitsch M. Hofmann F. Biel M. Nature. 1998; 393: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Establishment of Stable hHCN Cell Lines—All four hHCN plasmids (cDNA in vector pcDNA3, containing a neomycin open reading frame) were linearized using the unique restriction site PvuI located in the ampicillin open reading frame of the vector. Transfection of HEK293 cells was performed separately with each linearized HCN construct via electroporation (Bio-Rad electroporation system) following the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h after transfection 0.4 mg/ml G418 (neomycin) was added to the cell medium for selection. After 3 weeks in selection medium, resistant cell clones were picked and checked for RNA transcription by Northern blotting, protein expression by Western blotting, and the presence of HCN currents by patch clamp recordings. HCN-expressing cells were cultured in complete medium (Quantum286, PAA) with 0.2 mg/ml G418 at 37 °C, 8.5% CO2. For longer storage, cells in complete medium with 4% Me2SO are kept in liquid nitrogen. Construction of hHCN3/hHCN4 Chimeric Channel Mutants and Transient Expression in HEK293 Cells— hHCN3/4 chimeric channel mutants were constructed in the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) using overlapping PCR strategies. Briefly, DNA fragments containing the desired sequences were generated in several PCR steps using the hHCN3 and hHCN4 wild type cDNAs as templates and cloned into the HindIII/XbaI sites of the pcDNA3 vector. The correctness of the mutant channels was verified by DNA sequencing. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the mutant HCN channels using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions (transfectant/DNA ratio: 3/1 v/w). Cells were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and kept at 37 °C, 6% CO2. Currents were recorded 2-3 days after transfection as described under “Electrophysiology” (this section of text). Dot Blot Analysis—Dot blot analysis was performed using a human multiple-tissue expression array (BD Biosciences Clontech) containing normalized loadings of poly(A)+RNA from different human tissues. PCR fragments of hHCN1-4, amplified using the following oligonucleotides, were used as templates for the generation of 32P-labeled cDNA probes by random primed labeling (Random Primed DNA labeling Kit, Roche Applied Science): hHCN1, 5′-TGTCATTCAGGATCCACCCTGAATTCCACATCGTC (forward) and 5′-GCTTGAACTGGTACCCTGCTGTTGCATGAGTGACA (reverse); hHCN2, 5′-TACTTAGATGGATCCAGCTTCATGCAGCGCCAGTT (forward) and 5′-GTATCAATAGGTACCTCCTTGAAGAAGGTGATGCC (reverse); hHCN3, 5′-TGGATCCTAGGATCCTATTGTCTGATACTTTCTTCC (forward) and 5′-AAATGGCGCGTGGTACCGCGTCCAACCGTGGCTCCAG (reverse); hHCN4, 5′-AATCAGACTGGATCCCAGTGGGAGCAGCGGGGGCC (forward) and 5′-GAATTGGCTGGTACCTGGCAGTTTGGAGCGCACTG (reverse). Hybridization and washing conditions for the blots followed the manufacturer's instructions, with a prehybridization step of 30 min and an overnight hybridization step (all at 65 °C). The hybridized probe was visualized using BAS-1500 phosphorimaging (Fuji) after a total exposure time of 48 h. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from HEK293 cells transfected with of hHCN1, hHCN2, hHCN3, or hHCN4 using RNA blood mini kit (Qiagen). 2 μg of total RNA per lane were separated on a 0.9% formaldehyde gel for 4 h at 4°C. Blotting and hybridization with the HCN probes (see above) were carried out overnight. After two washing steps, the hybridized probe was visualized with phosphorimaging after an exposure time of 24 h. The same blot was probed subsequently with the four HCN probes. The blot was stripped between each hybridization with SDS-containing buffer. To estimate the sizes of the RNA bands, a RNA ladder (New England Biolabs) containing fragments from 0.5 to 9 kilobases was used. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis of HCN- or mock-transfected HEK293 cells with specific antibodies against HCN1, -2, -3, and -4 was performed basically as described (9Ludwig A. Zong X. Stieber J. Hullin R. Hofmann F. Biel M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2323-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 18Stieber J. Herrmann S. Feil S. Löster J. Feil R. Biel M. Hofmann F. Ludwig A. Proc.

Specific antibodies against HCN1 and HCN2 were obtained from Alomone Labs (Israel), HCN3-specific antibody was raised against the 228 amino acids (amino acids 552-779) after the end of the CNBD of the murine HCN3, and HCN4-specific antibody was raised against a peptide (TAAPQREPGARSEPVRSK) from the C terminus of the murine HCN4 as described in Stieber et al. (18Stieber J. Herrmann S. Feil S. Löster J. Feil R. Biel M. Hofmann F. Ludwig A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15235-15240Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Lysates from HEK293 cells (5-10 μg of total protein per lane) were applied on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel, separated, blotted, and probed with the antibodies using a chemiluminescence detection system. Electrophysiology—Electrophysiological recordings were performed as described (13Stieber J. Thomer A. Much B. Schneider A. Biel M. Hofmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33672-33680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Currents were recorded in whole cell configuration at 23 ± 1 °C using a MultiClamp 700A amplifier and pClamp9 software (Axon Instruments/Molecular Devices). Analysis was done offline with Origin 6.0 software (Microcal). Borosilicate glass pipettes for recording had a resistance of 2-5 megaohms when filled with intracellular (pipette) solution which contained 10 mm NaCl, 30 mm KCl, 90 mm potassium aspartate, 1 mm MgSO4, 3mm Mg-ATP, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH. The extracellular (bath) solution contained 120 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. The membrane potential was held at -40 mV. To elicit inward currents, step pulses of various durations were applied from -140 to -30 mV followed by a step to -140 mV (Fig. 2B). To account for the different activation kinetics, the duration of the prepulses were, if not stated otherwise: hHCN1, 0.5 s; hHCN2 and hHCN3, 3s; hHCN4, 8s. Time constants of activation (τact) were obtained by fitting the current traces of the -140 to -90 mV steps after the initial lag with the sum of two exponential functions: y0+A1exτ1+A2exτ2 where τ1 and τ2 are the fast and slow time constants of activation, respectively; τ1 is consequently referred to as τact since the slow component (A2) generally accounts for <20% of the current amplitude. To obtain voltage-dependent steady-state activation curves, tail currents measured immediately after the final step to -140 mV were normalized by the maximal current (Imax) and plotted as a function of the preceding membrane potential. The curves were fitted with the Boltzmann function, I−IminImax−Imin=A1−A21+eV−V1/2k+A2 where Imin is an offset caused by a nonzero holding current and is not included in the current amplitude, V is the test potential, V½ is the midpoint of activation, and k is the slope factor. For determination of the reversal potential (Erev), channels were maximally activated by a pulse to -130 mV for 2-10 s (depending on channel subtype), then test pulses from -100 mV to +40 mV were applied. Erev is the potential at which the ion flow changes from the inward to the outward direction. To get the current density, the amplitude was divided by the cell capacitance, obtained by the capacitance compensation function of the amplifier. The permeability ratio PNa/PK was calculated using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz voltage equation, Erev=−2.3RTFlog([K]in+PR×[Na]in[K]out+PR×[Na]out) where PR = PNa/PK and 2.3RT/F = 59.17 at 25 °C. The effect of cAMP or cGMP was tested by recording the basic parameters before and after switching to a bath solution containing 100 μm 8-Br-cAMP or 100 μm pCPT-cGMP (both Sigma). The effect of cesium was tested by repeatedly activating HCN channels by stepping from -40 to -100 mV. After 5-10 activations, superfusion was switched to a bath solution containing Cs+; after another 5-10 activations, superfusion was switched back to the normal bath solution. The effect of ZD7288 was tested by repeatedly activating HCN channels by stepping from -40 mV to -100 mV. After 8-10 activations, superfusion was switched to a bath solution containing ZD7288. A steady-state block was reached after 3-4 min. The blocking effect was calculated as residual current relative to maximal current before application of the substances. For the dose-response curves, increasing doses of cesium or ZD7288 starting at 0.01 μm were added to the bath. All values are given as the mean ± S.D.; n is the number of experiments. Statistical differences were determined using Student's unpaired t test; p values <0.05 were considered significant. Low Overall Expression of HCN3 in Human Brain—Human HCN3 mRNA could be detected by dot blot analysis only in neuronal tissues. The highest expression level was found in fetal brain (Fig. 1A). The overall expression level was relatively low compared with the expression of human HCN1 mRNA in brain tissues (Fig. 1B). hHCN1 mRNA was not detected in human fetal brain. Because HCN1 and HCN3 are potential pacemaker channels, expression in cardiac tissues was also expected, as has been described at least for HCN1 in other species (19Shi S. Wymore R. Yu H. Wu J.

Biel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27056-27061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, neither HCN1 nor HCN3 mRNAs could be detected in human heart. Probing a human tissue Northern blot for HCN1 and HCN3, as has been done in Ludwig et al. (9Ludwig A. Zong X. Stieber J. Hullin R. Hofmann F. Biel M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2323-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) for HCN2 and HCN4, confirmed that only HCN2 and HCN4 mRNAs are transcribed in human heart at detectable levels (data not shown). Functional Expression of Human HCN Channels in HEK293 Cells— Transient, high level expression of HCN channels in HEK293 cells led to very variable current densities and, especially for HCN3 and HCN4, to enhanced cell death. Thus, we established stable HEK293 cell lines for each of the 4 HCN channels by undirected integration of the HCN coding sequence into the genome of the host cell. Northern blot (Supplemental Fig. S1A) and Western blot analysis (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C) of HCN-expressing HEK293 cells confirmed the expression of the correct HCN subtype at easily detectable levels. Interestingly, HEK293 cells transfected with the murine HCN3 cDNA showed protein expression at an equally high level as human HCN3 transfected cells (supplemental Fig. S1B) even though murine HCN3 currents were generally very small and unstable (data not shown). We obtained cell lines with both high and low expression of human HCN protein and resulting large and small HCN current densities. For electrophysiological evaluation, cell clones were chosen with current densities of ∼20-100 picoamperes/picofarads at -140 mV. This corresponds to current amplitudes of 1-3 nA and cell sizes, represented by capacitance, of 10-50 picofarads. Fig. 2A shows examples of typical whole cell HCN currents of the indicated subtype, recorded with the protocol displayed in Fig. 2B. All four hHCN clones induce stable voltage-dependent inward cation currents with distinct activation kinetics. Supplemental Fig. S2 confirms that non-transfected wild type HEK293 cells do not show any inward currents when the protocol of Fig. 2B (or Fig. 4B) is applied. Human HCN3 Channels Have, Compared with the Other HCN Subtypes, an Intermediate Activation Kinetic and I-V-relation but the Same Reversal Potential—The voltage dependence of the activation time constants is shown in Fig. 3. In the activation potential range from -140 to -90 mV, hHCN2 and hHCN3 have similar activation kinetics, whereas HCN1 is much faster, and HCN4 is much slower activated. However, even the relatively small difference between HCN2 and HCN3 is statistically significant at p < 0.005. These curves clearly show that hHCN1 is faster than (<) hHCN2 < hHCN3 < hHCN4 at all voltages. Comparison of voltage-dependent activation curves and the midpoint of activation V½ (Fig. 4A and TABLE ONE) reveals that hHCN3 channels are activated at significantly more positive potentials than both hHCN2 and hHCN4 (differences between HCN2 and 4 are not significant) but at slightly more negative potentials than hHCN1. The difference between HCN1 and HCN3 is significant at p < 0.001. The reversal potential Erev has been determined for all four hHCN channels using the protocol displayed in Fig. 4B. The cation flow through the opened channels reverses at about -20 mV in 20 mm extracellular K+for all hHCN channels. HCN3 does not differ in this respect. Calculation of the permeability ratio PNa/PK using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz voltage equation confirms that HCN3, like the other HCN channels, conduct both potassium and sodium ions with an about 3:1 preference for potassium ions.

Chem. 2004; 279: 16832-16846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that native If and cloned HCN channels underlying If are blocked by extracellularly applied cesium. In that respect, human HCN3 is not different from any of the other subtypes (Fig. 5, A-C). Fig. 5A displays an example recorded from a hHCN3-expressing cell that is repeatedly activated with steps to -100 mV. Switching from a normal bath solution to a bath solution containing 2 mm cesium rapidly blocked the HCN current. The release of block was equally rapid upon switching back to bath solution without cesium. All 4 hHCN channels are rapidly, within 10 s, blocked by cesium (Fig. 5B). The dose-response curves for all hHCN channels (Fig. 5C) reveal similar affinities for cesium, with IC50 values of 201 ± 19, 206 ± 30, 157 ± 16, and 175 ± 20 μm for hHCN1, -2, -3, and -4, respectively. None of the differences are significant. Human HCN3 Channels Are Blocked by the Specific If Blocker ZD7288—Among other substances, ZD7288 has been identified as a relative specific blocker of the native If current in sino-atrial node cells (23BoSmith R. Briggs I. Sturgess N.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 353: 64-72Google Scholar). ZD7288 has also been shown to block, for example, cloned and heterologously expressed HCN1 channels (24Shin K. Rothberg B. Yellen G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We now found that ZD7288 indeed blocks all HCN channel subtypes, including hHCN3 (Fig. 5, D-F). Application of ZD7288 to the bath solution results in the inhibition of current flow. The onset of action is relatively slow; it takes 3-4 min until the steady-state inhibition is reached (Fig. 5E). This may be due to the fact that ZD7288 does not easily cross the cell membrane because application of ZD7288 on HCN channels from the inside of the cell membrane in inside-out patch mode (24Shin K. Rothberg B. Yellen G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) results in a fast inhibition of the current flow, within seconds. The inability to release the block by (extracellular) washout may confirm the fact that ZD7288 cannot cross the cell membrane to get out of the cell especially since washout in the inside-out patch mode is possible (24Shin K. Rothberg B. Yellen G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The dose-response curves of all four hHCN channels (Fig. 5F) show no significant differences in the affinity for ZD7288, with IC50 values of 20 ± 6, 41 ± 15, 34 ± 11, and 21 ± 14 μm for hHCN1, -2, -3, and -4, respectively. These values are similar to the IC50 for mHCN1 reported in Shin et al. (24Shin K. Rothberg B. Yellen G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The results with ZD7288 and cesium suggest that hHCN3 is a “typical” HCN channel despite the lack of response to cyclic nucleotide monophosphates described below. Human HCN3 Channels Are Not Modulated by Intracellular cAMP or cGMP—The addition of 100 μm concentrations of the membrane-permeable cAMP analog 8-Br-cAMP to the bath solution results in a modulation of the voltage-dependent activation and activation kinetics of hHCN1, -2, and -4 but not hHCN3 (Fig. 6 and TABLE ONE). In agreement with previous observations (13Stieber J. Thomer A. Much B. Schneider A. Biel M. Hofmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33672-33680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), hHCN2 and hHCN4 are well modulated by cAMP; the midpoint of activation V½ is shifted by 28.5 ± 5.9 and 23 ± 8.1 mV, respectively, toward more positive activation potentials (Fig. 6, A and B). Furthermore, activation of hHCN2 and hHCN4 channels was accelerated 2.2- and 4-fold, respectively (Fig. 6, C and D). hHCN1 is also modulated by cAMP, albeit to a lesser extent; the rightward shift of the activation curve is only 6.7 ± 4.0 mV, the acceleration of activation 1.4-fold. Both effects, however, are statistically significant at p < 0.05 versus the unmodulated state. The addition of 100 μm concentrations of the membrane-permeable cGMP analog pCPT-cGMP to the bath solution also results in a positive modulation of hHCN1, -2, and -4 (Fig. 6A). The modulation is less than for 100 μm cAMP, with shifts of V½ toward more positive activation potentials by 3.9 ± 2.1 mV (hHCN1, not significant), 13.1 ± 5.1 (hHCN2, significant), and 13.4 ± 1.6 (hHCN4, significant). Time constants of activation (Fig. 6C), however, are even less modulated by cGMP; activation kinetics of hHCN1, -2, and -4 are all slightly accelerated, but the difference is only significant with hHCN2. Human HCN3 channels, on the other hand, neither show a positive reaction to cAMP nor cGMP; V½ even shifts by 3.6 ± 4.3 mV (cAMP) and 1.6 ± 5.8 mV (cGMP) to slightly more negative potentials. This, however, indicates rundown rather than a negative modulation by cAMP/cGMP. Rundown was observed with all hHCN"

Both gelatinases (MMP-2 and -9) and membrane-type 1 MMP (MMP-14) are important targets for inhibition, since their roles in various diseases, including cancer, have been well established. We describe herein a set of mechanism-based inhibitors that show high selectivity to gelatinases and MMP-14 (inhibitor 3) and to only MMP-2 (inhibitors 5 and 7). These molecules bind to the active sites of these enzymes, initiating a slow binding profile for the onset of inhibition, which leads to covalent enzyme modification. The full kinetic analysis for the inhibitors is reported. These are nanomolar inhibitors (Ki) for the formation of the noncovalent enzyme-inhibitor complexes. The onset of slow binding inhibition is rapid (kon of 102 to 104 M-1 s-1 and the reversal of the process is slow (koff of 10-3 to 10-4 s-1). However, with the onset of covalent chemistry with the best of these inhibitors (e.g. inhibitor 3), very little recovery of activity (<10%) was seen over 48 h of dialysis. We previously reported that broad spectrum MMP inhibitors like GM6001 enhance MT1-MMP-dependent activation of pro-MMP-2 in the presence of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2. Herein, we show that inhibitor 3, in contrast to GM6001, had no effect on pro-MMP-2 activation by MT1-MMP. Furthermore, inhibitor 3 reduced tumor cell migration and invasion in vitro. These results show that these new inhibitors are promising candidates for selective inhibition of MMPs in animal models of relevant human diseases.

These results show that these new inhibitors are promising candidates for selective inhibition of MMPs in animal models of relevant human diseases. Extracellular proteolysis is an essential aspect of both physiological and pathological processes. Several enzyme families have been implicated in extracellular proteolysis, of which the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 3The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; mCPBA, 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, Dnp, 2,4-dinitrophenyl. constitute an important group. The MMPs are zinc-dependent endopeptidases that play key roles in embryonic development, neurological processes, wound healing, angiogenesis, arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer, just to mention a few examples. In cancer, for instance, MMPs are implicated at all stages of tumor progression, including tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis (1Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). Two MMPs, gelatinases A and B (MMP-2 and MMP-9, respectively), are highly expressed in human cancer, and a direct relationship between cancer progression and gelatinase expression and activity has been well established in many studies (2McCawley L.J. Matrisian L.M. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 149-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). As tumors manifest high levels of gelatinase activity, inhibitors specific for the gelatinases are highly sought. In the past 8 years, there have been numerous approaches aimed at targeting MMP activities in tumors, and several clinical trials were carried out to test the efficacy of various inhibitors. Unfortunately, the results of these trials were disappointing due to the lack of an objective clinical response and undesired side effects. Many reasons have been postulated for these effects, but at the core of the problem remains the issue of inhibitor selectivity (3Pavlaki M. Zucker S. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 177-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 4Coussens L.M. Fingleton B. Matrisian L.M. Science. 2002; 295: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar). Indeed, virtually all MMP inhibitors tested so far have been broad-spectrum inhibitors, designed around chelation of the active site zinc ion (5Skiles J.W. Gonnella N.C. Jeng A.Y. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 2911-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and their spectrum of inhibition includes, in addition to MMPs, other metalloenzymes. Because targeting gelatinases remains of great promise in cancer therapy (6Matrisian L.M. Sledge Jr., G.W. Mohla S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6105-6109PubMed Google Scholar), efforts aimed at developing better and selective gelatinase inhibitors continue. A mere handful of selective inhibitors for MMPs have been reported in the literature (for a review, see Ref. 7Brown S. Meroueh S.O. Fridman R. Mobashery S. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2004; 4: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We previously described the design and properties of inhibitor 1 (Fig. 1), which is a selective mechanism-based inhibitor for gelatinases. This compound binds to the active sites of MMP-2 and MMP-9, with the thiirane moiety coordinating with the zinc ion. This coordination to the active site metal ion activates the thiirane ring for opening by the nucleophilic attack of the active site glutamate in these enzymes (Fig. 2). A unique property of this inhibitor is that on binding to the active site zinc ion, a pattern of slow binding for inhibition sets in, leading to a rapid process for the onset of inhibition with an attendant slow process for recovery from slow binding at the noncovalent stage of inhibition. This noncovalent inhibited species leads to covalent inhibition by modification of the glutamate.FIGURE 2Mechanism of action of inhibitor 1.

Inhibitor 1 (in capped sticks and colored according to atom types) is shown coordinated to the active site zinc ion via the thiirane sulfur.

Chang M. Mobashery S. Fridman R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3523-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the poor solubility of this inhibitor in aqueous medium is a limitation of the molecule, which we have attempted to remedy. Furthermore, we have been interested in exploiting the concept behind the inhibitor design in targeting other MMPs. A computational model of the inhibitor bound in the active site of MMP-2 within the constraints of the data from x-ray absorption spectroscopy has been generated (10Kleifeld O. Kotra L.P. Gervasi D.C. Brown S. Bernardo M.M. Fridman R. Mobashery S. Sagi I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17125-17131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). This model for inhibition of inhibitor 1 led the way in exploration of the next generation of this type of MMP inhibitor. The possibility for specific electrostatic interactions near the terminal phenyl group in inhibitor 1 bound to the active site of MMP-2 was anticipated for judiciously designed chemical functionalities into the molecular template of compound 1. We have introduced three functional groups, the methylsulfonamide (compounds 2 and 3), the nitro (compounds 4 and 5), and the acetamide (compounds 6 and 7), at the terminal phenyl ring system to exploit these electrostatic interactions. It was expected that these molecules would improve the solubility in aqueous solutions while exhibiting high selectivity in inhibition toward gelatinases and the membrane-anchored MMP, MT1-MMP (MMP-14), which all share a deep S1′ binding site. As will be described herein, these expectations have been borne out, making these inhibitors valuable tools in studies of the functions of MMPs in disease processes. Furthermore, we have also prepared the oxirane variants of these molecules (compounds 2, 4, and 6). The fact that the oxirane variants are either poor inhibitors or demonstrate no observable inhibitory properties toward MMPs underscores the importance of the thiirane group for this inhibitor class.

Assessment of Inhibitor Solubility—Aliquots (10 μl) of the solutions of the thiirane compounds 1, 3, 5, and 7 in Me2SO (e.g. 10 mm, 12 mm, 14 mm and higher concentrations) were added to 990 μl of buffer R (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Brij-35, 1% Me2SO) at 37 °C. Each mixture was inspected for clarity (or turbidity) to calculate the approximate upper limit of solubility. Enzymatic Activity Assays—Enzymatic activity was monitored with synthetic peptide, fluorescence-quenched substrates from Peptides International, Inc. (Louisville, KY). The activities of MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-7, and MMP-14 were monitored with MOCAcPLGLA2pr(Dnp)AR-NH2 at excitation and emission wavelengths of 328 and 393 nm, respectively, in buffer R. MOCAcRPKPVE norvalyl (Nva)WRK(Dnp)NH2 was the fluorogenic substrate used to measure MMP-3 at 325 and 393 nm in buffer R. MMP-1 was assayed with (Dnp)P cyclohexylanalyl (Cha)GC(Me)-HAKNϵ-methylanthranoyl (NMa)NH2 at 340 and 440 nm, in a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 20 mm ZnSO4, 0.05% Brij-35. Less than 10% substrate hydrolysis was monitored (12Knight C.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 18-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was measured using a Photon Technology International spectrofluorometer, equipped with RadioMaster™ and FeliX™ hardware and software, respectively. The excitation and emission band passes were 1 and 3 nm, respectively. An integration time of 4 s was used for data acquisition. The assays were carried out at 25 °C, and the cuvette holder was kept at the same temperature. Quartz or disposable acrylic micro- or semimicrocuvettes from Sarstedt (Newton, NC) and Perfector Scientific (Atascadero, CA), respectively, were used. Enzyme Inhibition Studies—Slow binding enzyme inhibition was monitored continuously for 20-60 min by adding the enzyme (0.5-1 nm) to a solution of buffer R containing the appropriate fluorogenic substrate and increasing concentrations of the inhibitor (final volume 2 ml) in acrylic cuvettes with stirring. The progress curves were nonlinear least squares-fitted to Equation 1 (13Muller-Steffner H.M. Malver O. Hosie L. Oppenheimer N.J. Schuber F. J. Biol.

Association and dissociation rate constants (kon and koff, respectively) were obtained from the slope and intercept, respectively, of plots of the apparent first order rate constant k versus the inhibitor concentration according to Equation 2, k=koff+kon[I]/(1+[S]/Km)(Eq. 2) describing a one-step association mechanism (Scheme 1), where S is the fluorogenic peptide substrate used, and the EI* is the product of slow binding inhibition. The expression for kon includes the requisite conformational change necessary for the formation of EI*. The Km values used for the reaction of MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-14 with the fluorogenic substrate MOCAcPLGLA2pr(Dnp)AR-NH2 were 2.46 ± 0.34, 3.06 ± 0.74 (14Olson M.W. Gervasi D.C. Mobashery S.

Alternatively, Ki values were obtained by plotting (vo - vs)/vs versus the inhibitor concentration, according to Equation 3. (vo-vs)/vs=[I]/(Ki(1+[S]/Km))(Eq. 3) For analysis of simple linear competitive inhibition, reaction mixtures containing the enzyme (∼1 nm) and increasing concentrations of the inhibitor, in buffer R (final volume 1 ml), were incubated for ∼16 h at 25 °C in acrylic semimicrocuvettes. The remaining enzymatic activity was measured with the appropriate synthetic peptide fluorogenic substrate for 5-10 min. The initial velocities for the reaction of the enzyme with the substrate were determined by linear regression analysis of the fluorescence versus time traces using FeliX™. These initial rates were fitted to Equation 4 (16Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar), vi/vo=(Km+[S])/(Km(1+[I]/Ki)+[S])(Eq. 4) where vi and vo represent the initial velocity in the presence and absence of inhibitor, respectively, using the program Scientist. Equilibrium Dialysis—Mixtures of enzyme (10 nm) in the presence and absence of inhibitor (1 mm) were incubated at room temperature for ∼3 h. The remaining enzyme activity was measured with the appropriate fluorogenic substrate, as described above. Part of the reaction mixture (∼150 μl) was dialyzed in either dialysis tubing (Invitrogen) or in a 0.1-0.5-ml capacity Slide-A-Lyzer® dialysis cassette (Pierce), against buffer R (3 × 1 liter) containing no Me2SO, at room temperature, for >4-h periods prior to change of buffer to allow for equilibration, over a 48-h period. The remainder of the inhibition mixture was left on a rotator, at room temperature, over the same period of time. Both the dialyzed and nondialyzed solutions were tested for MMP activity using the proper fluorogenic substrate. Enzyme activity was expressed as a percentage relative to that in the absence of inhibitor. Cell Culture—Human HeLa S3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATTC, Manassas, VA) (CCL-2.2) and grown in suspension in an MEM Spinner (Quality Biologicals, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 5% horse serum. Nonmalignant monkey kidney epithelial cells, BS-C-1 (CCL-26), and human fibrosarcoma cells, HT1080 (CCL-121), were obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Recombinant Vaccinia Viruses—Recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding for T7 RNA polymerase (vTF7-3) or pro-MMP-2 (vT7-72), pro-MMP-9 (vT7-92), MT1-MMP (vT7-MT1), TIMP-1 (vT7-TIMP-1), and TIMP-2 (vSC59-T2) were produced by homologous recombination as previously described (17Fuerst T.R.

APMA was dialyzed out in collagenase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.02% Brij 35). Human recombinant active MMP-1 and MMP-7 were from R&D (Minneapolis, MN) and Chemicon International (Temecula, CA), respectively, and the recombinant catalytic domains of human MMP-3 and MMP-14 were from EMD Biosciences (La Jolla, CA). Active enzyme concentration was determined by active site titration with solutions of either TIMP-1 or TIMP-2 with known concentration. The hydroxamate-based MMP inhibitor BB-94 was synthesized in the Mobashery laboratory, and GM6001 was purchased from Chemicon. Stock solutions of BB-94, GM6001, and compounds 2-7 were prepared in Me2SO in the millimolar concentration range. Pro-MMP-2 Activation on Cells—Confluent BS-C-1 cells in 12-well plates were co-infected with vTF7-3 and vT7-MT1 viruses for 45 min in infection medium (DMEM supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics), at 37 °C, as described (18Hernandez-Barrantes S.

https://openalex.org/W1992523161,"TP53INP1 is an alternatively spliced gene encoding two nuclear protein isoforms (TP53INP1alpha and TP53INP1beta), whose transcription is activated by p53. When overexpressed, both isoforms induce cell cycle arrest in G1 and enhance p53-mediated apoptosis. TP53INP1s also interact with the p53 gene and regulate p53 transcriptional activity. We report here that TP53INP1 expression is induced during experimental acute pancreatitis in p53-/- mice and in cisplatin-treated p53-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). We demonstrate that ectopic expression of p73, a p53 homologue, leads to TP53INP1 induction in p53-deficient cells. In turn, TP53INP1s alters the transactivation capacity of p73 on several p53-target genes, including TP53INP1 itself, demonstrating a functional association between p73 and TP53INP1s. Also, when overexpressed in p53-deficient cells, TP53INP1s inhibit cell growth and promote cell death as assessed by cell cycle analysis and colony formation assays. Finally, we show that TP53INP1s potentiate the capacity of p73 to inhibit cell growth, that effect being prevented when the p53 mutant R175H is expressed or when p73 expression is blocked by a siRNA. These results suggest that TP53INP1s are functionally associated with p73 to regulate cell cycle progression and apoptosis, independently from p53."

https://openalex.org/W1990253313,"The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) branch of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade has been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis in a variety of mammalian cell types. In the heart, disagreement persists concerning the role that JNKs may play in regulating apoptosis, since both pro- and antiapoptotic regulatory functions have been reported in cultured cardiomyocytes. Here we report the first analysis of cardiomyocyte cell death due to JNK inhibition or activation in vivo using genetically modified mice. Three separate mouse models with selective JNK inhibition were assessed for ventricular damage and apoptosis levels following ischemia-reperfusion injury. jnk1–/–, jnk2–/–, and transgenic mice expressing dominant negative JNK1/2 within the heart were each shown to have less JNK activity in the heart and less injury and cellular apoptosis in vivo following ischemia-reperfusion injury. To potentially address the reciprocal gain-of-function phenotype associated with sustained JNK activation, transgenic mice were generated that express MKK7 in the heart. These transgenic mice displayed elevated cardiac c-Jun kinase activity but, ironically, were also significantly protected from ischemia-reperfusion. Mechanistically, JNK-inhibited mice showed increased phosphorylation of the proapoptotic factor Bad at position 112, whereas MKK7 transgenic mice showed decreased phosphorylation of this site. Collectively, these results underscore the complexity associated with JNK signaling in regulating apoptosis, such that sustained inhibition or activation both elicit cellular protection in vivo, although probably through different mechanisms.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). In its broadest sense, the MAPK signaling cascade is composed of at least three distinct phosphorylation cascades that culminate in the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs), and the p38 MAP kinases (1Garrington T.P Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). JNKs are activated in response to environmental stress or membrane-bound receptor signaling through GTPases of the Rho family through the MAPK kinase kinases (2Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). These MAPK kinase kinases then promote activation of the MAPK kinases such as MKK4 and MKK7, which function as dual specificity protein kinases to directly phosphorylate JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3 (2Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). Gene targeting in mice has revealed a critical role for JNK signaling in regulating cellular viability, induction of apoptosis, and cellular proliferation through phosphorylation of AP-1, p53, c-Myc, nuclear factor of activated T cells, Sap-1, and Bcl-2 family members (2Davis R.J.

An emerging area of investigation has demonstrated a critical, yet often paradoxical role for JNKs and their upstream activators in regulating cellular apoptosis. For example, jnk null fibroblasts were shown to be deficient in mitochondria-driven apoptosis, suggesting that JNK plays an important role in this process (6Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J.

Upstream of JNK1/2/3, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ask) null cells showed significant impairment in H2O2- and TNF-α-induced cell death (10Tobiume K. Matsuzawa A. Takahashi T. Nishitoh H. Morita K. Takeda K. Minowa O. Miyazono K. Noda T. Ichijo H. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, JNK1 inhibition was reported to protect cardiac myocytes from ischemia-induced apoptosis, whereas JNK2 inhibition had no effect (11Hreniuk D. Garay M. Gaarde W. Monia B.P. McKay R.A. Cioffi C.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Similarly, inhibition of JNK in H9c2 myocytes blocked apoptosis induced by stress stimulation (12Gabai V.L. Meriin A.B. Yaglom J.A. Wei J.Y. Mosser D.D. Sherman M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38088-38094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), whereas infection of adult cardiac myocytes with a dominant negative JNK-expressing adenovirus antagonized H2O2-induced apoptosis (13Kwon S.H.

Moreover, β-adrenergic-stimulated apoptosis of cultured adult cardiomyocytes was inhibited by expression of dominant-negative JNK through a mitochondria-dependent mechanism (14Remondino A. Kwon S.H. Communal C. Pimentel D.R. Sawyer. D.B. Singh K. Colucci W.S. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 136-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 15Aoki H. Kang P.M. Hampe J. Yoshimura K. Noma T. Matsuzaki M. Izumo S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10244-10250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, mekk1 null embryonic stem cells (MEKK1 is the direct upstream activator of MKK4 and MKK7) differentiated into cardiac myocytes showed enhanced oxidative stress-induced apoptosis (16Minamino T. Yujiri T. Papst P.J. Chan E.D. Johnson G.L. Terada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15127-15132Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), consistent with the observation that mekk1–/– mice have more cardiac apoptosis following pressure overload stimulation (17Sadoshima J. Montagne O. Wang Q. Yang G. Warden J. Liu J. Takagi G. Karoor V. Hong C. Johnson G.L. Vatner D.E. Vatner S.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Additional discordance was suggested by the observation that dominant negative JNK1 or dominant negative MKK4-expressing cultured cardiomyocytes had increased nitric oxide-induced apoptosis (18Andreka P. Zang J. Dougherty C. Slepak T.I. Webster K.A. Bishopric N.H. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Moreover, ischemia-reperfusion (I-R)-induced apoptosis in cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes was increased by expression of JNK inhibitory mutants (19Dougherty C.J. Kubasiak L.A. Prentice H. Andreka P. Bishopric N.H. Webster K.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus, it is readily apparent that JNK signaling has both pro- and antiapoptotic ramifications, although the overall dominance of either effect has not been extended to the heart in vivo. Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL)—TUNEL from histological heart sections was performed with the In Situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science) as per the manufacturer's instructions with slight modification (20De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Taigen T. Wencker D. Condorelli G. Dorn G.W. Kitsis R.N. Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Hearts were collected 24 h after ischemia-reperfusion injury for assessment of TUNEL within the infarction zone proper. At least 16 sections were analyzed throughout the entire longitudinal axis of the hearts, from which ∼5,000 myocytes were assessed each (n = 2–3 hearts/group). Western Blot Analysis—Protein extracts were generated from whole heart using extraction buffer as described previously (21De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Haq S. Force T. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13571-13579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Western blotting and enhanced chemifluorescence detection were performed as previously described (21De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Haq S. Force T. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13571-13579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Antibodies used included anti-phospho-p38, anti-p38, anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-JNK1/2, anti-Bad, anti-phospho-Bad-112 and -136, anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling), anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Research Diagnostics Inc.), and anti-MKK7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-Bad-128 was the generous gift of Dr. Azad Bonni (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Transgenic and Gene-targeted Mice—Transgenic mice containing concatomers of dominant negative JNK1 and JNK2 (FVB/N background) as well as jnk1–/– and jnk2–/– gene-targeted mice (C57Bl/6 background) were previously described (8Sabapathy K. Hu Y. Kallunki T. Schreiber M. David J.P. Jochum W. Wagner E.F. Karin M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 116-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 22Liang Q. Bueno O.F. Wilkins B.J. Kuan C.Y. Xia Y. Molkentin J.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5079-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). MKK7 transgenic mice (FVB/N background) were generated by cloning the mouse cDNA for wild-type MKK7 into the heart-specific α-myosin heavy chain promoter, as described for the dominant negative JNK1/2 transgenic mice (22Liang Q. Bueno O.F. Wilkins B.J. Kuan C.Y. Xia Y. Molkentin J.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5079-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Six MKK7 transgenic founders were initially identified at the time of genotyping (8 days of age), only one of which was viable long term due to lower levels of expression (the other founders died between 8 days and 5 weeks of age). Ischemia-Reperfusion in Mice—Cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury was performed in 6–8-week-old mice as described previously (23Kaiser R.A. Bueno O.F. Lips D.J. Doevendans P.A. Jones F. Kimball T.F. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15524-15530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The thoracotomy was closed, and the mice were revived for a 45-min (C57Bl/6 background) or a 60-min (FVB/N background) ischemic period, after which the knot was released and the heart was allowed to reperfuse for 24 h. Upon the completion of the reperfusion period, mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation, and the hearts were quickly removed for analysis of infarction injury with 2% triphenyl tetrazolium chloride as described previously (23Kaiser R.A. Bueno O.F. Lips D.J. Doevendans P.A. Jones F. Kimball T.F. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15524-15530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Images were quantified for area not at risk, area at risk (AAR), and infarcted area (IA). Echocardiography and Working Heart Analyses—For echocardiography, mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane, and hearts were visualized using a Hewlett Packard Sonos 5500 instrument and a 15-MHZ transducer. Cardiac ventricular dimensions were measured on M-mode three times for the number of animals indicated in the table. The isolated ejecting mouse heart preparation has been described in detail previously (24Gulick J. Hewett T.E. Klevitsky R. Buck S.H. Moss R.L. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Kinase Assays—Cardiac ERK, JNK, and p38 kinase activities were determined using a published method (25Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (22Liang Q. Bueno O.F. Wilkins B.J. Kuan C.Y. Xia Y. Molkentin J.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5079-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Soluble protein extracts (1 mg) were incubated with agarose-conjugated antibodies to ERK1 and ERK2 or p38 for 3 h. Complexes were washed two times in lysis buffer and two times in kinase buffer. MBP was used as substrate for ERK and p38, whereas GST-c-Jun (amino acids 1–79) was used to isolate JNK kinases and as a substrate. The reaction was started by the addition of 100 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated at 30 °C for 20 min followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Differences between experimental groups were evaluated for statistical significance using Student's t test for unpaired data or one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's post-test. p values of <0.050 were considered to be statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed by using Instat 3.0 software (GraphPad). Characterization of Cardiac JNK Activity in JNK-inhibited Mice— Previous reports attempting to establish a causal association between JNK signaling and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes have been largely equivocal, possibly due to a primary reliance on culture-based models. Here we evaluated three distinct animal models with inhibited JNK signaling: mice lacking the jnk1 gene, mice lacking the jnk2 gene, and mice containing a heart-specific transgene that simultaneously expresses dominant negative mutants of JNK1 and JNK2. We have previously shown that all three genetic models have a significant reduction in total JNK activity within the heart at base line and following acute agonist stimulation in vivo (22Liang Q. Bueno O.F. Wilkins B.J. Kuan C.Y. Xia Y. Molkentin J.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5079-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These mice did not show alterations in base line or inducible ERK or p38 activity within the heart, demonstrating specificity for JNK signaling itself (22Liang Q. Bueno O.F. Wilkins B.J. Kuan C.Y. Xia Y. Molkentin J.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5079-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). With respect to I-R injury to the heart, wild-type mice in either the FVB/N or C57Bl/6 strain background showed significant elevations in total cardiac JNK activity (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1, A and B). However, JNK1/2 dominant negative transgenic mice, jnk1–/– mice, and jnk2–/– mice each showed significant attenuation in JNK activity in the heart following I-R injury (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1, A and B). No alterations were observed in ERK or p38 activity in response to the dnJNK1/2 transgene or the jnk1 or jnk2 null alleles at base line or after I-R injury (data not shown). Collectively, these results indicate that I-R injury is a potent inducer of cardiac JNK activity and that all three genetic models used here show a significant and specific reduction in cardiac JNK signaling. JNK-inhibited Mice Show Less Cardiac Injury following I-R—To investigate the functional correlations between reduced JNK activity and cardiac cellular damage following ischemic injury, each of the three genetic models was subjected to a surgical I-R procedure. The data demonstrate significant cardiac injury in wild-type control mice as assessed by measurement of viable myocardium at risk (AAR) versus the nonviable IA (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2A). However, dnJNK1/2 transgenic mice, jnk1–/– mice, and jnk2–/– mice each showed a significant protection from I-R-induced myocardial damage when compared with their strain-matched controls (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2A). No difference in the AAR versus the left ventricular (LV) area was observed in any of the groups, suggesting that the difference in infarction injury was not a secondary consequence of variable perfusion area. Collectively, these results indicate that JNK-inhibited mice have reduced susceptibility to cardiac injury following I-R injury in vivo. JNK-inhibited Mice Show Reduced Indexes of Apoptosis following I-R Injury—The observed reduction in left ventricular injury following I-R in each of the JNK-inhibited mice suggested an alteration in cellular apoptosis rates in the heart. To address this possibility, left ventricular tissue was harvested after I-R injury and subjected to Western blotting for cleaved caspase-3 (activated). The data demonstrate significant caspase-3 cleavage in FVB/N and C57Bl/6 wild-type hearts following I-R injury but significantly less cleavage in dnJNK1/2, jnk1–/–, and jnk2–/– hearts (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3A). On average, each of the three JNK-inhibited models showed an approximate 50% reduction in total caspase-3 cleavage across two independent experiments, each containing triplicate samples (six hearts each). dnJNK1/2 transgenic mice also showed significant reductions in DNA laddering after I-R injury compared with wild-type controls (data not shown). Finally, total cell apoptosis rates were also evaluated by TUNEL within the LV infarcted area itself following I-R injury (after 24 h of reperfusion). The data demonstrate that I-R injury dramatically enhances TUNEL within the IA of the LV of wild-type C57Bl/6 mice but that the jnk1/2 gene-targeted mice displayed a significant decrease in this index of cell death (Fig. 3B). A consistent trend toward less poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage was also observed in the JNK-inhibited mice (data not shown). Collectively, these data indicate that JNK-inhibited mice are less susceptible to cardiomyocyte cell death following I-R injury. Sustained JNK Activation Also Protects the Heart from Death in Vivo—The data discussed above demonstrate that genetic inhibition of JNK in the heart provides protection from I-R-induced cell death. Thus, we initially hypothesized that activation of JNK within the heart would produce the antithetic effect of increased cell death. To validate this hypothesis, we generated transgenic mice expressing the JNK-specific dual specificity kinase MKK7 using the heart-specific α-myosin heavy chain promoter (Fig. 4A). Whereas six lines were initially identified at the time of genotyping (8 days of age), five died before breeding age. One line died at 5 weeks of age with severe dilated cardiomyopathy upon histological examination (Fig. 4B, presumed higher expressor). The lethality observed in the majority of MKK7 transgenic mice is consistent with previous descriptions of severe cardiomyopathy in independently generated MKK7 transgenic mice with robust JNK activation (26Petrich B.G. Molkentin J.D. Wang Y. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 749-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 27Petrich B.G. Gong X. Lerner D.L. Wang X. Brown J.H. Saffitz J.E. Wang Y. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These results are also in contrast to our previous experience in generating MEK1 heart-specific transgenic mice in which all nine original founders were viable, even with exceedingly high expression levels (28Bueno O.F. De Windt L.J. Tymitz K.M. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. Klevitsky R. Hewett T.E. Jones S.P. Lefer D.J. Peng C.F. Kitsis R.N. Molkentin J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6341-6350Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Despite the lethality associated with MKK7 transgene, one low copy line (based on Southern blotting) was identified that appeared relatively normal upon histological examination at 7 weeks of age (Fig. 4B, presumed low expressor relative to the other lethal lines). Quantitative Western blotting demonstrated 3.8-fold more MKK7 protein in the heart compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 4C). Whereas “low” MKK7 transgenic mice were viable and relatively normal, they did show a mild 10–15% increase in normalized heart weight, suggesting some degree of cardiac hypertrophy (TABLE ONE). Despite this observation, MKK7 transgenic mice demonstrated no signs of functional decompensation at 6 and 9 months of age as assessed by echocardiography and working heart preparations (TABLES ONE and TWO, and data not shown). In fact, MKK7 transgenic mice were slightly hyperfunctional in systole (+dP/dt), probably due to the 10–15% compensated hypertrophy response that characterizes these mice (TABLE TWO). Low expressing MKK7 transgenic mice also did not show any signs of cardiac pathology upon histological examination (data not shown).TABLE ONEEchocardiographic and cardiac gravimetric analysis of MKK7 transgenic miceSeptumLVLVEDLVESFSHW/BWHW/TLmmmmmmmm%mg/gmg/mmWild type FVBN0.70 ± 0.141.13 ± 0.094.05 ± 0.202.33 ± 0.1342 ± 4.34.75 ± 0.255.16 ± 0.46MKK7 TG0.66 ± 0.071.16 ± 0.203.93 ± 0.572.23 ± 0.3443 ± 4.35.28 ± 0.20ap < 0.05 versus wild type FVBN.5.96 ± 0.28ap < 0.05 versus wild type FVBN.a p < 0.05 versus wild type FVBN.

Open table in a new tab Hearts harvested from adult MKK7 transgenic mice consistently showed 4–5-fold greater c-Jun kinase activity (Fig. 4, D and E). MKK7 transgenic hearts did not show any alterations in p38 phosphorylation levels at base line or following I-R injury. However, MKK7 transgenic hearts did show a mild increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation at base line (Fig. 4F). Remarkably, adult MKK7 transgenic mice showed significantly smaller infarctions following I-R injury compared with nontransgenic littermates (Fig. 4G). Consistent with this observation, MKK7 transgenic mice also demonstrated lower levels of TUNEL in the infracted area of the LV compared with wild-type controls (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4H). Thus, MKK7 expression in the heart, which is associated with a mild increase in JNK1/2 activity, also promoted cellular protection following I-R injury in vivo. JNK-inhibited Mice Demonstrate Increased Bad Phosphorylation at Amino Acid 112—A series of Western blots was performed to assay expression levels and/or phosphorylation status of key apoptosis-regulatory factors in an attempt to identify a potential mechanism that might underlie, in part, the relative cardiac protection observed in the JNK-inhibited mice. Western blots were performed for most Bcl-2 family members, only one of which showed a significant correlation with JNK inhibition in vivo. For example, no change was observed in Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, Bax, or Bad in the hearts of JNK-inhibited mice at base line or following I-R injury; nor were changes observed in Bad phosphorylation at serines 128 and 136 (data not shown). In contrast, a consistent increase in Bad phosphorylation at serine 112 was observed at base line and after I-R injury in the hearts of jnk1–/– and dnJNK1/2 transgenic mice, and a trend toward an increase was also observed in jnk2–/– hearts (Fig. 5, A–C). No alteration in total Bad protein levels was observed (Fig. 5, A–C). Consistent with these results, MKK7 transgenic mice showed a reproducible decrease in Bad serine 112 phosphorylation in the heart (Fig. 5D). Thus, alteration in Bad phosphorylation at serine 112 may represent one potential effector mechanism downstream of JNK signaling in the heart that participates in the apoptotic response. However, phosphorylation of serine 112 inactivates the proapoptotic functions of Bad; thus, the decrease in phosphorylation observed in MKK7 transgenic hearts would not be consistent with protection from I-R injury (see “Discussion”). A number of equally robust studies conducted in cultured cardiomyocytes have reported both prosurvival and prodeath regulatory effects associated with altered JNK signaling (29Baines C.P. Molkentin J.D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2005; 38: 47-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). A similar dichotomous paradigm has emerged in neurobiology, such that JNK is both protective and apoptotic, depending on the region of the brain analyzed. For example, jnk1/2 double null mice die as embryos and display reduced levels of cell death in regions of the hindbrain prior to neural tube closure but increased levels of apoptosis in the forebrain and other regions of the hindbrain at a later time point (9Kuan C.Y. Yang D.D. Samanta Roy D.R. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 30Sabapathy K. Jochum W. Hochedlinger K. Chang L. Karin M. Wagner E.F. Mech. Dev. 1999; 89: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Moreover, embryonic stem cells or fibroblasts derived from mekk1 null and mkk4/7 double null mice, which were each defective in JNK signaling, were still capable of undergoing apoptosis to multiple stimuli (31Nishitai G. Shimizu N. Negishi T. Kishimoto H. Nakagawa K. Kitagawa D. Watanabe T. Momose H. Ohata S. Tanemura S. Asaka S. Kubota J. Saito R. Yoshida H. Mak T.W. Wada T. Penninger J.M. Azuma N. Nishina H. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1621-1626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 32Yujiri T. Sather S. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In direct contrast to these results, jnk1/2 double null fibroblasts were largely resistant to cell death induced by similar stimuli (6Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell. R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar). A similar paradigm is also observed with the apoptotic propensity of T- and B-lymphocytes. For example, jnk1 or jnk2 null T cells were resistant to anti-CD3-induced apoptosis, suggesting a proapoptotic regulatory role (33Sabapathy K. Kallunki T. David J.P. Graef I. Karin M. Wagner E.F. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, jnk1 null pre-B cells showed diminished survival, suggesting an antiapoptotic role for JNK in these cells (34Hess P. Pihan G. Sawyers C.L. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, numerous examples exist to support the dichotomous regulatory functions attributed to JNK signaling in controlling cellular survival or death. One potential explanation for the seemingly opposite results discussed above is that JNK signaling intersects with multiple apoptotic effector pathways that might differ with respect to cell type and/or timing of expression and interaction with JNK. The Bcl-2 family appears to serve as prominent downstream effectors of JNK signaling that may partially underlie the prodeath versus prosurvival signaling decisions of JNK. For example, stress-induced cytochrome c release and apoptosis was shown to require JNK activity and effective Bax/Bak function, suggesting a prominent role in regulating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway at the level of the mitochondria (35Lei K. Nimnual A. Zong W.X. Kennedy N.J. Flavell R.A. Thompson C.B. Bar-Sagi D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4929-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Indeed, Izumo and colleagues showed that activated JNK and MKK4 localized to the mitochondria, induced cytochrome c release, and promoted the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes (15Aoki H. Kang P.M. Hampe J. Yoshimura K. Noma T. Matsuzaki M. Izumo S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10244-10250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). That a fraction of JNK protein localizes to the mitochondria was also observed by Ping and colleagues (37Baines C.P. Zhang J. Wang G.W. Zheng Y.T. Xiu J.X. Cardwell E.M. Bolli R. Ping P. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and is consistent with an earlier observation made in fibroblasts whereby JNK was required for cytochrome c release and mitochondria-driven cell death (6Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell. R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar). JNK signaling can also induce apoptosis through a transcription-dependent mechanism that involves c-Jun activation and the induction of proapoptotic genes, which might also be linked to Bcl-2 family member modulation (38Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). With respect to more direct regulatory mechanisms, JNK was shown to phosphorylate the prosurvival factor Bcl-2, resulting in its inactivation and the induction of apoptosis (39Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar, 40Fan M. Goodwin M. Vu T. Brantley-Finley C. Gaarde W.A. Chambers T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29980-29985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). JNK was also shown to directly phosphorylate serine 128 on Bad, enhancing cell death through the intrinsic pathway (41Donovan N. Becker E.B. Konishi Y. Bonni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40944-40949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, JNK-mediated phosphorylation of Bad at threonine 201 had the opposite effect of enhancing cell survival by inactivating Bad (42Yu C. Minemoto Y. Zhang J. Liu J. Tang F. Bui T.N. Xiang J. Lin A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Thus, JNK signaling can have dichotomous effects on cell survival even through the same effector protein by putatively phosphorylating different residues. We did not observe alterations in Bad phosphorylation at serine 128 or 136 in response to reduced or increased JNK signaling in the heart, in contrast to the observed increase and decrease in serine 112 phosphorylation from JNK-inhibited and activated hearts, respectively. Phosphorylation of serine 112 in Bad was shown to inactivate the proapoptotic function of this Bcl-2 family member, providing cellular protection (43Harada H. Becknell B. Wilm M. Mann M. Huang L.J.

However, MKK7 transgenic mice had a significant reduction in serine 112 phosphorylation, a result that is consistent with proximal regulation by JNK but is inconsistent with protection from cell death observed in MKK7 transgenic hearts. Decreased phosphorylation of serine 112 should be more permissive to cell death not protective as observed in MKK7 transgenic hearts. Thus, whereas there is a strong correlation in regulation between JNK signaling and Bad 112 phosphorylation, regulation of Bad does not play a dominant role in determining the survival of myocytes in the hearts of MKK7 transgenic mice. Protection from I-R injury in MKK7 transgenic hearts may be partially associated with increases in ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4), since MEK1-ERK1/2 signaling was previously shown to protect the mouse heart from I-R injury in vivo (28Bueno O.F.

Alternatively, the mild cardiac hypertrohic phenotype itself, associated with the MKK7 transgene, may provide a degree of protection from cell death through undefined mechanisms. It is also ironic that loss of a kinase (JNK) is associated with greater phosphorylation of Bad at serine 112, whereas increases in JNK activity are associated with less phosphorylation of serine 112. A number of kinases have been shown to directly mediate phosphorylation of serine 112 in Bad, such as protein kinase A, Rsk, p21-activated kinase 1, and PIM-2, any one of which could be indirectly regulated by JNK at the mitochondria (43Harada H.

JNK activation was also recently shown to directly activate Bid cleavage, independent of caspase-8, thus further facilitating the mitochondrial death pathway (48Deng Y. Ren X. Yang L. Lin Y. Wu X. Cell. 2003; 115: 61-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Finally, JNK was reported to directly phosphorylate two additional proapoptotic members of the BH3-only subgroup of Bcl-2 proteins, Bim and Bmf, facilitating their translocation to the mitochondria (49Lei K. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2432-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). The observed association between JNK inhibition and the modulation of Bcl-2 family members is reminiscent of our previous observations in which p38 MAPK-inhibited transgenic mice showed a dramatic up-regulation in Bcl-2 expression within the heart (23Kaiser R.A. Bueno O.F. Lips D.J. Doevendans P.A. Jones F. Kimball T.F. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15524-15530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In fact, genetic inhibition of p38 MAPK signaling in the heart also provided protection from I-R injury similar to that of JNK inhibition presented here (23Kaiser R.A. Bueno O.F. Lips D.J. Doevendans P.A. Jones F. Kimball T.F. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15524-15530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, Glembotski and colleagues generated transgenic mice with constitutive p38 activation in the heart due to expression of MKK6, which was also associated with profound protection from I-R injury similar to the protection observed here due to constitutive JNK activation mediated by MKK7 (50Martindale J.J. Wall J.A. Martinez-Longoria D.M. Aryal P. Rockman H.A. Guo Y. Bolli R. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 669-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, p38 MAPK appears to function analogous to JNK in the heart, such that sustained activation or inhibition provides protection from cell death. Mechanistically, we favor the hypothesis that both the pro- and antiapoptotic effects associated with JNK and p38 modulation occur through regulatory relationships with specific Bcl-2 family members. In addition to differential effects on diverse Bcl-2 family members that vary by cell type or time of expression, JNK signaling might even enhance or attenuate apoptosis within the same cells, depending on the absolute magnitude, duration, or context of the signaling response. For example, robust and sustained JNK activation might augment apoptosis, whereas transient or mild JNK activation might act in a protective manner by “preconditioning” or “desensitizing” a given cell type to prodeath stimuli. Alternatively, the dichotomous apoptotic effects attributed to JNK signaling (and p38 signaling) may also depend on co-regulation or recruitment of other intracellular signaling pathways that are independent of the Bcl-2 family. The data presented here, although seemingly dichotomous, actually solidify the hypothesis that JNK signaling specifically and simultaneously modulates pro- and antiapoptotic effector mechanisms within cardiomyocytes. However, with respect to a potential therapeutic application of this pathway in providing cellular protection, we favor the hypothesis that acute inhibition of JNK will potentially benefit the myocardium most (as opposed to chronic activation of JNK signaling), consistent with a recent pharmacological study (36Ferrandi C.

Earlier studies suggested that serglycin-proteoglycans form macromolecular complexes with granzymes and perforin in the cytotoxic granule. Serglycin-proteoglycans may also be involved in the delivery of the cytolytic machinery into target cells. We have developed a serglycin-deficient mouse strain, and here we studied the importance of serglycin-proteoglycans for various aspects of cytotoxic T lymphocyte function. 35SO42- radiolabeling of serglycin-deficient cells demonstrated a dramatic reduction of incorporated label as compared with wild type cells, indicating that serglycin is by far the dominating proteoglycan species produced by the cytotoxic T lymphocyte. Moreover, lack of serglycin resulted in impaired ability of cytotoxic T lymphocytes to produce secretory granule of high electron density, although granule of lower electron density were produced both in wild type and serglycin-deficient cells. The serglycin deficiency did not affect the mRNA expression for granzyme A, granzyme B, or perforin. However, the storage of granzyme B, but not granzyme A, Fas ligand, or perforin, was severely defective in serglycin-deficient cells. Serglycin-deficient cells did not display defects in late cytotoxicity toward target cell lines. Taken together, these results point to a key role for serglycin in the storage of granzyme B and for secretory granule maturation but argue against a major role for serglycin in the apoptosis mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

Ley T.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 323-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar and 2Lieberman J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). CTL-mediated cytotoxicity is mediated by either the Fas ligand (FasL) or the perforin/granzyme pathway, where the Fas-dependent pathway is typical for self-reactive lymphoid cells and the perforin/granzyme-induced apoptotic pathway is mainly involved in destruction of infected cells or tumor cells. The granzymes constitute a large family of serine proteases, exclusively expressed by CTLs and NK cells. In mouse, eight granzymes have been identified (granzymes A–G and M), and humans have five known granzymes (granzymes A, B, H, M, and K (tryptase-2 or granzyme 3) (see Refs. 3Grossman W.J. Revell P.A. Lu Z.H. Johnson H. Bredemeyer A.J. Ley T.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar and 4Trapani J.A. Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (reviews): 3014.1-3014.7Crossref Google Scholar, and references therein)). Depending on substrate specificity the granzymes can be grouped into subfamilies with either trypsin-like-(granzymes A, D, and K), chymotrypsin-like (granzyme H), Asp-ase-(granzyme B), or Met-ase-(granzyme M) substrate specificities (4Trapani J.A. Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (reviews): 3014.1-3014.7Crossref Google Scholar). The granzymes are synthesized as preproenzymes and are processed into the active form by the sequential action of signal peptidases and dipeptidyl peptidase I (5Pham C.T. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8627-8632Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Of the various granzymes, granzymes A and B are the most abundant granzymes in mice and humans (2Lieberman J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Granzyme A induces a caspase-independent apoptotic pathway by cleaving the linker histone H1 and lamins (6Zhang D.

Granzyme B has been shown to be important for the rapid induction of apoptosis (9Heusel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar) and has been shown to induce apoptosis through both caspase-dependent and independent pathways (10Darmon A.J. Ley T.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21709-21712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Granzyme-mediated cytotoxicity is critically dependent on perforin, the only known membrane-disrupting protein in rodent cells. It was initially thought that perforin induces pore formation in the plasma membrane of target cells and that the granzymes are delivered through this route (reviewed in Ref. 11Kagi D. Ledermann B. Burki K. Zinkernagel R.M. Hengartner H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 207-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). However, this model has been challenged by the finding that granzyme B can enter target cells autonomously (12Froelich C.J. Orth K. Turbov J. Seth P. Gottlieb R. Babior B. Shah G.M. Bleackley R.C. Dixit V.M. Hanna W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29073-29079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and through the identification of granzyme receptors on the surface of target cells (13Trapani J.A. Sutton V.R. Thia K.Y. Li Y.Q. Froelich C.J. Jans D.A. Sandrin M.S. Browne K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14Motyka B. Korbutt G. Pinkoski M.J.

Furthermore, it was recently reported that granzymes could be delivered into target cells without plasma pore formation (15Metkar S.S. Wang B. Aguilar-Santelises M. Raja S.M. Uhlin-Hansen L. Podack E. Trapani J.A. Froelich C.J. Immunity. 2002; 16: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Proteoglycans (PGs) constitute a heterogeneous group of molecules, which are all composed of a protein core to which one or more glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains are attached. It has been known for a considerable time that PGs are components of the secretory granule of cytotoxic cells. In 1985 it was reported that NK cells contained a protease-resistant chondroitin sulfate PG species that was released upon incubation of the NK cells with target cells, and the possibility that these PGs are involved in the packaging of cytolytic granule compounds was discussed (16Schmidt R.E.

Indeed, a subsequent report suggested that both perforin and granzyme A interacted with PGs at acidic pH, although the interaction with perforin with PGs was weakened at neutral pH (18Masson D. Peters P.J. Geuze H.J. Borst J. Tschopp J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11229-11235Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). More recently it was shown that both granzyme B and perforin in cell extracts from YT cells co-precipitated with a PG species (15Metkar S.S. Wang B. Aguilar-Santelises M. Raja S.M. Uhlin-Hansen L. Podack E. Trapani J.A. Froelich C.J. Immunity. 2002; 16: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Importantly, it was demonstrated that granzyme B was present as a complex with a PG after exocytosis and that the PG/granzyme B complex retained capacity to induce apoptosis (15Metkar S.S. Wang B. Aguilar-Santelises M. Raja S.M. Uhlin-Hansen L. Podack E. Trapani J.A. Froelich C.J. Immunity. 2002; 16: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Along the same line, it has been shown that granzyme B in complex with free chondroitin 4-sulfate (chondroitin sulfate A) induces apoptosis in Jurkat cells (19Galvin J.P. Spaeny-Dekking L.H. Wang B. Seth P. Hack C.E. Froelich C.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5345-5350PubMed Google Scholar). It is widely believed that it is PGs of the serglycin (SG) species that are localized to the CTL/NK cell granule. This notion is largely based on the observed resistance of PGs in NK granule to protease digestion, taking into account that the small SG core protein (∼17 kDa (20Stevens R.L. Avraham S. Gartner M.C.

Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14194-14200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that SGPGs purified from monocyte (15Metkar S.S. Wang B. Aguilar-Santelises M. Raja S.M. Uhlin-Hansen L. Podack E. Trapani J.A. Froelich C.J. Immunity. 2002; 16: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and CTL (23Raja S.M. Wang B. Dantuluri M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 49523-49530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) cell lines indeed interact with perforin and granzyme B in purified systems. It has also been reported that SG mRNA is present in cytotoxic T cell lines (24Elliott J.F. Miller C.L. Pohajdak B. Talbot D. Helgason C.D. Bleackley R.C. Paetkau V. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 749-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, these findings do not provide any formal proof as regards the identity of the PG species prevalent in CTL/NK cell cytolytic granule. For example, it has not been possible to assess the relative contribution of SG versus other PG species in organization of cytolytic granule. Furthermore, although several reports have indicated an interaction between SGPGs and cytolytic compounds in vitro (see above), it is not known whether SG is the in vivo binding partner of, e.g. granzymes and perforin. We have recently developed a mouse strain with a targeted inactivation of the SG gene (25Abrink M. Grujic M. Pejler G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40897-40905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and in the present study we used this strain to study the role of SG in CTLs. We show that SGPG is the dominating PG species expressed by CTLs and that SG is necessary for storage of granzyme B and for formation of electron dense cytolytic granule. In contrast, SG is not essential for storage of granzyme A, perforin, or FasL and is not necessary for cytotoxic activity of CTLs. Reagents—The chromogenic peptide substrate Ac-IEPD-pNA and methyl-d-mannopyranoside were from Sigma. Concanavalin A (ConA) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. [methyl-3H]Thymidine, Na35SO42-, donkey anti-rabbit Ig and anti-mouse Ig, both antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Monoclonal anti-human granzyme A antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences AB (Stockholm, Sweden), antisera toward granzyme B and FasL were from Lab Vision Corp. (Fremont, CA), and the antiserum toward perforin was from Nordic BioSite AB (Stockholm, Sweden). Mice—Mice deficient in SG as described previously (25Abrink M. Grujic M. Pejler G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40897-40905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), were back-crossed to C57BL/6J (animals in present study were at the N4 to N6 generation with a mixed genetic background of C57BL/6J (∼95–99%) and 129SVJ (∼1–5%)). Age-matched littermates (8–18 weeks old) from intercrosses of heterozygote N4 to N6 animals were used in all experiments. Production of Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes—CTLs were generated from blood or spleen of either SG+/+, SG+/-, or SG-/- littermate mice (8–18 weeks old). Blood samples were taken from the euthanized littermate mice, and to block coagulation, an equal volume of 20 mm citrate buffer (in PBS) was added. The blood was then diluted with 2 ml of PBS and placed on a 6-ml Ficoll-Paque Plus solution cushion (Amersham Biosciences). Mononuclear cells were isolated at room temperature by centrifugation at 400 × g for 40 min using a swing-out rotor. Isolated mononuclear cells were rinsed with PBS and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Statens Veterinarmedicinska Anstalt, Uppsala, Sweden) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 50 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate (Statens Veterinarmedicinska Anstalt), and 2 mm l-glutamine (Statens Veterinarmedicinska Anstalt). CTLs were derived from the isolated cells (106 cells/ml) by stimulation with ConA (2 μg/ml) for 3 days. Spleens were removed from mice and by squeezing the spleen through a 200-μm mesh nylon screen with the plunger of a syringe a single cell suspension of splenocytes was made. Red blood cells were lysed for 5 min at room temperature in 5 ml of ACK buffer (0.15 m NH4Cl, 10 mm KHCO3, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, pH of the buffer is 7.2–7.4). The splenocytes were then rinsed twice with 30 ml of PBS and resuspended in the same medium as was used for blood-derived cells (se above) to a concentration of 5 × 106 spleen cells/ml. CTLs were derived by further stimulation of the spleen cells with 2–5 μg/ml ConA for 3–5 days. Morphology of Cells—Giemsa staining was performed according to a standard procedure. Cytospin slides were fixed in methanol (3 min), washed once in H2O, stained with 5% Giemsa (Merck) for 10 min, and washed in H2O again. Transmission Electron Microscopy—CTLs from SG+/- and SG-/- mice were fixed for 6 h in 2% glutaraldehyde in a 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer supplemented with 0.1 m sucrose, followed by 1.5 h postfixation in 1% osmium tetroxide dissolved in the same cacodylate buffer. After dehydration in ethanol the cells were embedded in the epoxy resin Agar 100 (Agar Scientific, Stansted, UK). Ultrathin sections were placed on copper grids covered with a film of polyvinyl formal plastic (Formvar, Agar Scientific) and contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Electron micrographs were taken with a Hitachi electron microscope (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) (26Lukinius A. Jansson L. Korsgren O. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 429-435PubMed Google Scholar). Glycosaminoglycan Isolation and Analysis—∼30 × 106 of either non-stimulated (day 0) or ConA-stimulated spleen cells (3 days after addition of ConA) of both genotypes were biosynthetically labeled overnight with 0.38 mCi of carrier-free [35S]sulfate (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 300 × g (4 °C) and solubilized (at 4 °C) by adding 1 ml of PBS/2 m NaCl/0.5% Triton X-100. After 30-min incubation, 35S-labeled macromolecules were purified as described before (Abrink et al. (25Abrink M. Grujic M. Pejler G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40897-40905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar)). Anion exchange chromatography, chondroitinase ABC digestion, and Sephadex G-50 chromatography were described previously (Abrink et al. (25Abrink M. Grujic M. Pejler G. J. Biol.

RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA from CTLs and from the CTLL-2 cell line (gift from Thomas Tötterman, Rudbeck Laboratory, Uppsala, Sweden) was isolated using KIT NucleoSpin RNAII (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Superscript II (Invitrogen) and specific reverse primers were used to produce single-stranded cDNA for granzyme A, granzyme B, perforin, syndecan-1–4, glypican-1–6 (as a control for the validity of syndecan and glypican primers, total RNA of day 14–16 whole embryos was prepared and subjected to RT-PCR), and hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT). HPRT expression was used as a housekeeping control. The PCR reaction was 40 cycles with annealing and melting temperatures of 65 and 96 °C, respectively. The sequences of the PCR primers used are specified in TABLE ONE. The identity of amplified bands was verified by DNA sequencing. PCR products were purified from the agarose gel by QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (VWR International AB, Stockholm, Sweden) and were sequenced using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator version 1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and specific primer. The sequencing reaction was 25 cycles with annealing, polymerization, and melting temperatures of 50 °C, 60 °C, and 95 °C, respectively. Furthermore, DNA was precipitated with EtOH, resuspended in Template Supression Reagent (Applied Biosystems).TABLE ONESequences of PCR primers used The primers used for amplification of granzyme A, granzyme B, and perforin were taken from Kelso et al.

Samples corresponding to equal numbers of cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% gels. Proteins were subsequently blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, followed by blocking with 5% milk powder in TBS/0.1% Tween 20 (1 h, room temperature). Next, the membranes were incubated with monoclonal Abs or antisera, diluted 1:200–1:250 in TBS/2% bovine serum albumin/0.1% Tween 20, at 4 °C overnight. After washing the membranes extensively with TBS/0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit or antimouse Ig, both conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1:5000 in TBS/0.1% Tween 20). After 45 min of incubation at room temperature, the membranes were washed extensively with TBS/0.1% Tween 20. The membranes were developed with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Measurement of Granzyme B Activity—Granzyme B activity was determined as previously described by Ewen et al. (27Ewen C. Kane K.P. Shostak I. Griebel P.J. Bertram E.M. Watts T.H. Bleackley R.C. McElhaney J.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 276: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 × 106 CTL, stimulated with 5 μg/ml ConA for 3 days, were washed with PBS and lysed in 50 μl of lysing buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) for 15 min on ice with occasional shaking. The lysates were centrifuged for 1 min at 10,000 × g, 4 °C. 5-μl samples from the resulting supernatant (corresponding to 3 × 105 cells) were added to 96-well flat-bottomed plates, followed by the addition of 95 μl of a reaction buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 0.05% (w/v) CHAPS, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) and 10 μl of N-Ac-IEPD-pNA (200 μm, dissolved in Me2SO). Plates were covered and incubated at 37 °C. Released paranitroanilide (pNA) was recorded at 405 nm using a Titertek Multiscan spectrophotometer (Flow Laboratories). Cytotoxicity Assays—The JAM test was performed according to the protocol described by Matzinger (28Matzinger P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 145: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Spleen cells of SG+/+, SG+/-, and SG-/- littermate mice (mixed genetic background of C57/Bl6 and 129SVJ mice, both with H-2b haplotype) were stimulated with 2 μg/ml ConA for 3 days. CTLs were then thoroughly washed with medium (see above, production of CTLs) and resuspended in fresh medium containing 0.1 m d-mannopyranoside at a concentration of 6 × 106 cells/ml. As targets, various tumor cell lines were used: EL4 (syngeneic, H-2b haplotype, a gift from Lars Hellman, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden) and three allogeneic cell lines, P815 (H-2d haplotype, LGC Promochem, Borås, Sweden), J558 (H-2d haplotype, a gift from Lars Hellman), and YAC-1 (H-2a haplotype, LGC Promochem). Target cells were labeled overnight with 5 μCi/ml of [3H]thymidine. Before setting the cytotoxic assay, the targets were washed with medium and the cell concentration was adjusted to 105 cells/ml with culture medium containing 0.1 m methyl-d-mannopyranoside. Next, 100 μl of effector cells and 100 μl of target cells (giving an effector/target ratio of 30:1 or 60:1) were transferred into a 96-well round-bottom microtiter plate. To measure spontaneous target cell lysis (S), 100 μl of target cells was transferred to 100 μl of culture medium in the absence of effector cells. An identical plate as the latter (100 μl of target cells only) was also prepared for analysis of total counts (T). Plates were covered with a lid and centrifuged at 150 × g (room temperature) for 3 min. All of the plates, except the plate that was used for determination of total counts, were then left in a CO2 incubator. After various time points (4, 7, and 21 h), cells were harvested using a microtiter plate cell harvester and the amount of 3H radioactivity bound to the filters was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The plate used for determination of total counts was harvested immediately after the centrifugation step. The cytotoxic activity of CTL was calculated as: % cytotoxicity = [(S - E)/S] × 100, where % spontaneous lysis = [(T - S)/T] × 100, T is total counts; S is spontaneous release, and E is experimental release. Molecular Modeling of Mouse Granzyme A and B—The closest homologs of mouse granzyme A and B in the PDB structural data base were identified using BLAST (29Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A.

The model for human granzyme A (pdb id 1op8 (30Hink-Schauer C. Estebanez-Perpina E. Kurschus F.C. Bode W. Jenne D.E. Nat. Struct.

Harris J.L. Fletterick R. Craik C.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar); 80% identities) was used. Homology models were generated using SOD (32Kleywegt G.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and the molecular graphics program O (33Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). To allow comparison of surface charge distribution, side chains of charged residues not modeled in the crystallographic structures were added in standard rotamer conformations. Side-chain rotamers were adjusted where necessary to avoid steric clashes. Surface representations were generated using PYMOL (www.pymol.org). Morphology of Concanavalin A-activated CTLs—CTLs were generated from spleen and blood of both SG+/- and SG-/- animals, by culturing splenocytes and blood mononuclear cells in the presence of concanavalin A (ConA) for 5 days. Cytospin slides of non-stimulated (NS) and ConA-stimulated spleen cells were stained with Giemsa. As shown in Fig. 1A, activation of spleen cells with ConA caused a marked change in morphology, including dramatically enlarged cytoplasm. However, no obvious differences in morphology between SG+/- and SG-/- cells were observed at the light microscope level. This is in sharp contrast to the effect of the SG knock-out on mast cells, where SG inactivation was associated with dramatic morphological changes that were observable by the MayGrunewald/Giemsa stain (25Abrink M. Grujic M. Pejler G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40897-40905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To get better insight into the possible effect of SG on CTL morphology we used transmission electron microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of both SG-/- and+/- CTLs (Fig. 1B) revealed accurately processed spherical cells. In both genotypes mitochondria, free ribosomes, transport vesicles, and nuclei demonstrated an apparently normal ultrastructure. Some of the cells showed deep plasma membrane invaginations that appeared as translucent “holes” in the cytoplasm. In contrast, a clear difference between genotypes was detected in the ultrastructure of the cytotoxic granule. The CTLs derived from the SG+/- mice contained mostly heteromorphous cytotoxic granule with an electron-dense, irregular core in a transparent space but also some spherical electron-translucent granule filled with an amorphous matrix (Fig. 1B), whereas SG-/- CTLs possessed exclusively spherical electron-translucent granule with an amorphous matrix (Fig. 1B). Effects of the SG Knock-out on the Synthesis of Sulfated PGs in CTLs—Although numerous studies have suggested that PGs of the SG species is a major component of cytolytic granule in CTLs (see the introduction), there is no definitive evidence for this notion. It was therefore imperative to assess the relative contribution of SG to the total amount"
https://openalex.org/W2114217579,"The study of the signaling pathways regulating neurite outgrowth in culture is important because of their potential role in neuronal differentiation in vivo. We have previously shown that the Gαo/i-coupled CB1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) activates Rap1 to induce neurite outgrowth. Gαo/i also activates the Src-Stat3 pathway. Here, we studied the relationship between the Gαo/i-Rap1 and Src-Stat3 pathways and the role of these signaling pathways in CB1R-mediated neurite outgrowth in Neuro-2A cells. The CB1 agonist HU-210 induced pertussis toxin-sensitive Src and Stat3 phosphorylation. Dominant negative (DN) mutants of Src and Stat3 blocked CB1R-induced neurite outgrowth. Constitutively active Rap 1B and Ral-activated Src and CB1R-induced Src phosphorylation was inhibited by Rap1-DN and Ral-DN, indicating that both Rap1 and Ral mediate downstream signaling from Gαo/i for Src activation. Rap1-activated Ral and Ral-DN blocked Rap-induced Src phosphorylation. Gαo-induced Stat3 activation was blocked by Ral-DN, whereas v-Src-induced Stat3 activation was not inhibited by Ral-DN, indicating that the CB1R, through Gαo, mediates the sequential activation of Rap1 to Ral to Src to Stat3 in Neuro-2A cells. Downstream of Src, the CB1R also activated Rac1 and JNK, which enhanced CBR1-mediated Stat3 activation. Rac-DN blocked CB1R-induced activation of JNK. Pharmacological inhibition of JNK blocked Src and CB1R activation of Stat3, indicating that Rac and JNK are also involved in CB1R-mediated neurite outgrowth. Overall, this study demonstrated that Gαo/i-coupled CB1R triggers neurite outgrowth in Neuro-2A through the activation of a signaling network containing two pathways that bifurcate at Src and converge at Stat3.

Overall, this study demonstrated that Gαo/i-coupled CB1R triggers neurite outgrowth in Neuro-2A through the activation of a signaling network containing two pathways that bifurcate at Src and converge at Stat3. The differentiation process in neurons is a complex phenomenon involving changes in electrophysiological properties as well as morphological features characterized by dendritic and axonal outgrowths, broadly termed neurite outgrowth. The capacity to elaborate processes has achieved its maximal complexity in neurons, which utilize dendritic arbors to regulate the number of synaptic contacts and thus define the frequency at which impulses spread and thereby establish regionally distinct functional outputs (1Larkum M.E. Zhu J.J. Sakmann B. Nature. 1999; 398: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). The regulation of neurite outgrowth is tightly controlled because of its critical physiological function. There are many signals that control the growth and directionality of dendrites and axons (2Song H.J. Poo M.M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 3Yuan X.B. Jin M. Xu X. Song Y.Q. Wu C.P. Poo M.M. Duan S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Many intracellular signaling components that control neurite outgrowth have been studied (4Xiang Y. Li Y. Zhang Z. Cui K. Wang S. Yuan X.B. Wu C.P. Poo M.M. Duan S. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, their connections into networks have not been fully defined. Several G protein-coupled receptors trigger neurite outgrowth. For example, D2 dopamine receptors regulate neurite outgrowth in cortical neurons (5Reinoso B.S. Undie A.S. Levitt P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 43: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Serotonin-1 B receptors are known to enhance neurite outgrowth in thalamic neurons (6Lotto B. Upton L. Price D.J. Gaspar P. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 269: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These receptors are coupled to Gαi/o proteins, and Gαo, one of the most abundant proteins in the neuronal growth cones, can induce neurite outgrowth (7Strittmatter S.M. Fishman M.C. Zhu X.P. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2327-2338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies indicate that Gαi/o-coupled receptors play an important role in controlling neurite outgrowth. However, the signaling pathways by which the Gαi/o signals trigger neurite outgrowth have not been determined. Recently, we demonstrated that the CB1 cannabinoid receptor, which is coupled to Gαi/o, mediates neurite outgrowth through activation of Rap1 by enhancing proteasomal degradation of Rap1GAPII (8Jordan J.D.

In a previous study, we show that Gαi/o activates the c-Src-Stat3 pathway in NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells leading to cell transformation (10Ram P.T. Horvath C.M. Iyengar R. Science. 2000; 287: 142-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Because c-Src is also an abundant protein in neuronal growth cones, we wondered as to the relationship between Rap and c-Src in Gαi/o neurite formation and outgrowth. In this study, we showed that CB1 receptor activation leads to the Rap-dependent phosphorylation of Src and Stat3, and this network plays a critical role in neurite outgrowth. The network includes the small GTPases, such as Ral and Rac, as well as protein kinases such as JNK 3The abbreviations used are: JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; DN, dominant negative; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; CB1R, CB1 cannabinoid receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; GDS, GDP dissociation stimulator; RBD, Ras binding domain.3The abbreviations used are: JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; DN, dominant negative; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; CB1R, CB1 cannabinoid receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; GDS, GDP dissociation stimulator; RBD, Ras binding domain./p38 that are involved in this process. These studies showed, within a fully endogenous system, the presence of a two-armed complex network that contains multiple small GTPases converging on Stat3 to regulate neurite outgrowth.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfection—Neuro-2A cells were cultured in 44% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 44% F-12 medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% glutamine. Transfection was performed when cells were 75% confluent using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The catalytic domain of Src was replaced by green fluorescent protein to create a dominant negative form of Src (provided by Dr. Pamela L. Schwartzberg, National Institutes of Health). A dominant negative mutant of Stat3 was created by mutation of the tyrosine phosphorylation site (Y-F) or mutation of the DNA binding site (DN EE(E/V)VV) (10Ram P.T. Horvath C.M. Iyengar R. Science. 2000; 287: 142-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Dominant negative or constitutively active mutants for small G proteins (Rap1, Ral, and Rac) were purchased from the Guthrie laboratory (San Francisco, CA). 24 h after transfection, cells were plated onto 6- or 24-well plates and stimulated with the indicated concentrations of HU-210 (Sigma) for various times according to the experimental designs.Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and tyrosine/serine-threonine phosphorylation inhibitors, including sodium fluoride (30 mm), sodium orthovanadate (2 mm), and sodium pyrophosphate (10 mm). After determination of the protein concentration, the cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using the following types of antibodies: anti-phospho-Stat3 monoclonal, anti-Stat3 polyclonal, anti-phospho-Src polyclonal (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), and anti-total Src monoclonal (Upstate Biotechnology).Ral and Rac1 Activation Assays—Activated Ral and Rac1 were measured by use of the RalGDS or Rho-GDS binding domain (Ral-GDS-RBD or RhoGDS-RBD) using the same method as described for Rap1 (9Jordan J.D. He J.C. Eungdamrong N.J. Gomes I. Ali W. Nguyen T. Bivona T.G. Philips M.R. Devi L.A. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11413-11421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-RalGDS-RBD and GST-RhoGDS-RBD fusion proteins prebound to glutathione beads were used to detect the active GTP-bound form of Ral and Rac1 in cell lysates in the presence of dithiothreitol and protease inhibitor mixtures. GTP-bound Ral and Rac1 were separated from beads by boiling the samples in loading buffer. The samples were then resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies for Ral and Rac1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Stat3 Luciferase Assay—Neuro-2A cells were transfected with the Ly6E Stat3-response luciferase reporter construct (10Ram P.T. Horvath C.M. Iyengar R. Science. 2000; 287: 142-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), Gαo or Src constructs, and with or without dominant negative mutant constructs for Ral and Rac in serum-free medium. The next day, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (Invitrogen), and luciferase activity was measured using a fluorometer. β-galactosidase activity was measured simultaneously as a control.Neurite Outgrowth Assay—Neuro-2A cells were plated in 6-well plates. The cells displaying neurite outgrowth were those that had cellular projections of length two times greater than the cell diameter. For each culture condition, randomly chosen regions of the plate containing 100 cells were scored under a phase contrast microscope (Nikon TMS) (9Jordan J.D. He J.C. Eungdamrong N.J. Gomes I. Ali W.

All assays were carried out in triplicate, and the indicated values are represented as mean ± S.E. (n = 3).Data Analysis—The data are represented as mean ± S.E. For Western blot analysis, all experiments were repeated at least three times. Representative experiments are shown. Bands were quantified by densitometric analysis and expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistically significant differences were determined by unpaired Student's t test. Significance was defined as p < 0.05.RESULTSHU-210 Induces Src and Stat3 Phosphorylation in Neuro-2A Cells by Activating the Gαo/i-coupled CB1 Cannabinoid Receptor—Because we have previously shown that Gαo mediates activation of the Src-Stat3 pathway in NIH-3T3 cells (10Ram P.T. Horvath C.M. Iyengar R. Science. 2000; 287: 142-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we tested here whether activation of Gαi/o-coupled CB1 receptor caused phosphorylation of Src/Stat3 in Neuro-2A cells. Treatment of Neuro-2A cells with HU-210 (a CB1 receptor agonist) led to a dose-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of Src and Stat3 (Fig. 1, A and B). This increase in phosphorylation was abolished by the CB1 receptor antagonist (SR1411716A) and by pretreatment with pertussis toxin, indicating that the effect is agonist-dependent and requires the Gαi/o pathway (Fig. 1, C and D). These data indicate that Gαi/o-coupled CB1 receptor activation leads to the activation of the Src-Stat3 pathway in Neuro-2A cells.Src/Stat3 Pathway Is Involved in the CB1 Receptor-mediated Neurite Outgrowth—Because the CB1 receptor activates the Src/Stat3 pathway, we tested here whether Src/Stat3 activation is required for CB1 receptor-induced neurite outgrowth. Neuro-2A cells were transfected with Src-DN or Stat3-DN to block the levels of activated Src and Stat3, respectively. Thereafter, the cells were stimulated with HU-210 at different concentrations as indicated (Fig. 2, A and B). We found that both Src-DN and Stat3-DN significantly inhibited HU-210-induced neurite outgrowth in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B). Transfection with a combination of Src-DN and Csk led to a more significant inhibition (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that the Src-Stat3 pathway is necessary for Gαi/o-coupled CB1 receptor-mediated neurite outgrowth.FIGURE 2Effect of Src-DN and Stat3-DN on neurite outgrowth. Neuro-2A cells were transfected with plasmids for Src dominant negative (A), Stat3 dominant negative (B), a combination of Src dominant negative and CSK (C), or pcDNA3 as a control vector. Cells were plated into a 6-well plate coated with poly-l-lysine, and after 24 h, they were serum-starved for another 24 h. The cells were then treated with HU-210 (0–10 μm final) for 16 h at 37 °C. Neurites were scored as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells with neurites more than twice the cell body were scored as positive. Results are mean ± S.E. of three experiments in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Signal Flow from Rap1/Ral to Src/Stat3 Occurs upon Activation of the CB1 Receptor—We have previously reported that the CB1 receptor-mediated neurite outgrowth requires Rap1 activation through proteasomal degradation of Rap1GAPII (9Jordan J.D.

We also tested the role of Ral in CB1 receptor-induced Src phosphorylation, because it was found previously that Rap1 can activate Ral (11Kishida S. Koyama S. Matsubara K. Kishida M. Matsuura Y.

We also found that constitutively active Rap1 activated Ral in Neuro-2A cells (Fig. 3B). Finally, both Rap1-DN and Ral-DN abolished the effect of HU-210 on Src phosphorylation (Fig. 3C), indicating that both Rap1 and Ral are required for CB1 receptor-induced Src phosphorylation in Neuro-2A cells. Interestingly, Ral activation was not affected significantly by Src-DN (Fig. 4A). Also, Ral-DN did block Src-induced Stat3 activation, as it efficiently blocked HU and Gαo-induced Stat3 activation (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that Ral acts upstream of Src in the CB1 receptor/Gαi/o-induced signaling pathway in Neuro-2A cells.FIGURE 3CB1 receptor-induced Src phosphorylation is mediated by Rap1 and Ral activation. A, Neuro-2A cells were transfected with either pcDNA3 (C), plasmid for constitutively active Rap1A (Rap1A-GV), Rap1B (Rap1B-GV), or Ral (Ral-GV), and after 48 h, the cells were lysed for Western blot analysis using phospho-Src and total Src antibodies. B, cells were transfected as above and after 24 h were incubated with 1 μm HU-210 for 30 min and then lysed for the Ral pull-down assay to detect Ral-GTP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, cells transfected with Rap1-DN or Ral-DN, were treated with or without 1 μm HU-210 for 30 min, and then lysed for Western blot analysis using phospho-Src and total Src antibodies.

Furthermore, both v-Src and HU/Gαo-induced Stat3 activation were inhibited by Rac-DN (Fig. 5C), indicating that Rac acts downstream of Src in the CB1receptor/Gαo-induced signaling pathway.

Therefore, we directly tested the role of Ral and Rac1 in the CB1 receptor-mediated neurite outgrowth. We found that Ral-DN (1 μg of plasmid in a 10-cm dish) completely blocked neurite outgrowth (Fig. 6A). Transfection of Rac-DN at 1 μg of plasmid in 10-cm dish caused significant cell toxicity. We found that the inhibitory effect of Rac-DN on neurite outgrowth depended on the amount of Rac-DN (100–300 ng) used for transfection (Fig. 6B). 90% of inhibition was observed at 300 ng of plasmid.FIGURE 6Ral and Rac mediate CB1 receptor-induced neurite outgrowth.

We found that treatment with HU-210 enhanced JNK phosphorylation (Fig. 7A). HU-210 also induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation (not shown) in Neuro-2A cells. Interestingly, the JNK/p38 inhibitor (SB-202190), but not the MAPK1,2 inhibitor (PD 098059), significantly inhibited HU-induced Stat3 activation (Fig. 7B) and neurite outgrowth (Fig. 7C).

Such a hierarchy predicts a temporal relationship between the GTPases. To determine this temporal relationship between the GTPases in CBIR network signaling, we conducted time course experiments for the activation of the various signaling components in HU-stimulated cells (Fig. 8). We found that the activation of Rap1 occurred by 5 min. Activation of Ral was also seen observable by 5 min and reached maximum by 10 min. Src activation occurred by 10 min. Src-activated Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation was also observable by 10 min and lasted for more than 2 h. Rac activation was the slowest and occurred by 30 min. Overall, the time course experiments support the hierarchy of components deduced from the previous experiments, although the reason for the delay for coupling between Src and Rac is not entirely clear.FIGURE 8Time course analysis of HU-induced signaling activation in Neuro-2A cells. Neuro-2A cells were treated with HU-210 (1 μm) for the time intervals as indicated in the figures. The cells were lysed for the determination of small G activation, including Rap1, Ral, and Rac by pull-down assay using the kits provided by Upstate Biotechnology (A, B, and D).

The pathways regulating neurite outgrowth in culture are likely to play a role in the terminal differentiation of neurons in vivo.

It should be emphasized that all of the components in the network were native, and the perturbations we introduced were to block signal flow at various levels in the network.We found that activation of the CB1 receptor/Gαi/o leads to the activation of a cascade of signaling components, including Rap1, Ral, Src, Rac, and JNK, resulting in both Tyr and Ser phosphorylation of Stat3.

However, the implication of the various domains for enzyme activity and substrate specificity remains largely unknown. Similarly, additional studies are required for a better understanding of the mechanisms of ADAMTS activation and for the identification of enzymes responsible for ADAMTS processing. In this work, various forms of bovine recombinant ADAMTS-2, either full size, lacking specific domains, or mutated at specific sites, were produced. They have been used to determine the specific role of individual domains for aminoprocollagen type I peptidase activity, to characterize the activation process of the zymogen form of ADAMTS-2, and to evaluate the enzymatic activity of ADAMTS-2 on aminoprocollagen type v. Restriction enzymes, Pwo DNA polymerase, hygromycin B, FuGENE 6 transfection reagent, α2-macroglobulin, and anti-HA rat antibody were from Roche Diagnostics; ligase (DNA Ligation kit version 2) was from Takara Biomedicals (Shiga, Japan). Competent bacteria (XLGold® Ultracompetent Cells) and QuickChange™ XL site-directed mutagenesis kit were from Stratagene (Cedar Creek, TX). pCEP4 vector, DMEM culture medium, and DM1™ competent cells used for preparation of plasmid requiring BclI digestion were from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum was from Cambrex (verviers, Belgium); the ECL detection system was from Amersham Biosciences, and the antiFLAG™ M2 mouse monoclonal antibody used for Western blotting was from Sigma. The gon-1 cDNA was the kind gift of J. Kimble (17Blelloch R. Kimble J. Nature. 1999; 399: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Creation of the various Expression vectors and Cell Transfection— For the creation of construct 1, a vector containing the bovine ADAMTS2 cDNA (18Colige A. Li S.W. Sieron A.L. Nusgens B.V. Prockop D.J. Lapiere C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2374-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) was digested at the NotI and HindIII sites (Fig. 1A). The released insert was then subcloned in a pCDNA3 vector containing a modified multiple cloning site. The 3′-end of the cDNA was PCR-amplified with Pwo DNA polymerase using primer A as forward primer (5′-CTACAAGGACGCCTTCAGCCTCT-3′) and primer B containing NheI- and XbaI-specific sequences at its 5′-end as reverse primer (5′-CTCTTCTAGATTAGCTAGCGAACTTTCCGAGCATCTCTTTCTTC-3′). After HindIII/XbaI digestion, the PCR product was ligated downstream from the NotI/HindIII insert. The construct was then linearized at the NheI site in order to introduce a double-stranded adaptor (sense, 5′-CTAGCGATTATAAAGATGACGATGACAAATAA-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTAGTTATTTGTCATCGTCATCTTTATAATCG-3′) coding for an M2-FLAG (DYKDDDDK) followed by a TAA stop codon. Because of its design, ligation of the adaptor restored an NheI site only at its 5′-end. Finally, the construct was digested (NotI/XbaI), and the insert containing the M2-FLAG at its 3′-end was ligated in the NotI/NheI site of a modified pCEP4 vector. Constructs 2–5 were obtained by replacing the HindIII/NheI cassette of construct 1 by PCR products amplified using primer A as forward primer and primers C (5′-CTCTTCTAGATTAGCTAGCTAGCCACTGGACCACGTAGCTCT-3′), D (5′-CTCTTCGCTAGCAGGGCACAGCTCGCGGTTGCA-3′), E (5′-CTCTTCGCTAGCGGAGCACTCCTGTGGGTTGCA-3′), or F (5′-CTCTTCTAGATTAGCTAGCCTCATAGCCCACAGAGTCGTCTT-3′) as reverse primers. Construct 6 was created by using a QuickChange™ XL site-directed mutagenesis kit and two mutagenic primers (M, 5′-GTTCGTGGTGGCCCACGCGACTGGCCATGTGCTGG-3′, and N, 5′-CCAGCACATGGCCAGTCGCGTGGGCCACCACGAAC-3′) changing the GAG codon for Glu of the Zn2+-binding catalytic site (HETGH) into a GCG codon for Ala. For constructs 8–10, the EcoRI/HindIII fragment of construct 1 was removed and replaced by PCR products amplified using J(5′-GGATCTCAAACATCTTGATGTAACCA-3′) as reverse primer and primers G (5′-CACAGAATTCCATGCTGCCGACGACGACTACAAC-3′), H (5′-CACAGAATTCGGGAACCCCTCTCAAAGTCTGGA-3′), and I (5′-CACAGAATTCACGCTGAACCACGAGGACGGCTT-3′) as forward primers, each of them containing an EcoRI site at their 5′-end. For construct 7, the vector containing construct 8 was linearized at the EcoRI site, allowing the ligation of an EcoRI-digested PCR product amplified with primers K (5′-TTTGGCCGAGACCTGCACCTGC-3′) and L (5′-CACAGAATTCCATACTCCGCCTGGAGCTGTTGA-3′) containing an EcoRI site at their 5′-end. Primer L was also designed in order to change the sequence coding for a furin cleavage site (RRRMRR) into a sequence coding for an unrelated amino acid sequence (FEMSRR). For construct 11, the BclI/HindIII fragment of construct 1 was removed. After incubation with Pwo DNA polymerase and dNTP in order to generate blunt ends, the vector was selfligated. This introduced a large deletion but did not change the open reading frame of the remaining coding sequence. For constructs 12 and 13, construct 1 was digested by HindIII/NheI or BclI/HindIII, respectively, and the deleted sequences were replaced by corresponding domains amplified from gon-1 cDNA using primers O (5′-CACACAGCTAGCTCTTGGACATGGAATTCTGTTACATTC-3′)and P(5′-CACACAAAGCTTGGTTATAACGAAGTAATGAAGATTCCA-3′), or Q (5′-CACACAAAGCTTTCCTTGCTCATTAAATGTTCCTTTGA-3′) and R (5′-CACAGGATCCTGTCCAACATCATGACGTTGCAATC-3′).

This 9-amino acid insertion does not modify the level of expression or the enzymatic activity of the various forms of the recombinant enzymes. The various expression vectors were used to transfect different cell lines (HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, WI26 immortalized lung fibroblasts, COS, Balb, MCF7, SaOS2 osteosarcoma cells, 293EBNA epithelial kidney cells) by using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Stable cell lines were then selected in DMEM culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 200 μg/ml hygromycin. Cell Culture and Treatment—Stably transfected cells expressing the various constructs were cultured in DMEM supplemented with fetal calf serum and hygromycin. At confluence, the growth medium was removed, and the cells were maintained in DMEM alone or containing specific chemicals or inhibitors at the indicated concentrations. After 24 or 48 h, the different media were collected, and the cells were scraped and extracted for 2 h in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 500 mm NaCl; 2 gmm CaCl2;25mm NEM; 1 mm PMSF). After centrifugation, the cell extracts were collected (cell extract 1), and the pellets were solubilized in SDS-PAGE denaturation buffer containing 100 mm DTT (cell extract 2). For correlation studies comparing the levels of each individual band of enzyme to the aminoprocollagen peptidase activity, 293 cells expressing various constructs were cultured for 24 h in medium supplemented with 0.1 or 5% fetal calf serum alone (control conditions) or containing additional chemicals (EDTA at 0.04, 0.2, or 1 mm; ZnCl2 at 16 or 80 μm; CuCl2 at 16 or 80 μm; heparin at 1, 5, or 25 μg per ml; decanoyl-RvKR (furin inhibitor) at 10, 20, or 40 μm; l-arginine at 25, 50, or 100 mm). Compartmentalization Studies—Dermatosparactic calf fibroblasts, cells that do not synthesize ADAMTS-2, were grown to confluence (duplicate culture, 24-wells culture plates) in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were then incubated at 4 °C in 400 μlof medium containing or not heparin (5 μg/ml) and recombinant purified ADAMTS-2 (10 μg/ml). After 6 h, medium was removed, and the cell layer was denatured in Laemmli sample buffer containing 0.1 m DTT. Western blot analysis using mAb23 was then performed to determine the proportion of ADAMTS-2 bound to the cell layer. Large Scale Purification of Enzyme—For large scale purification of recombinant enzymes, 100 Petri dishes of stably transfected cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and hygromycin. At confluence, medium was removed and replaced by serum-free DMEM containing soybean trypsin inhibitor (40 μg/ml), heparin (5 μg/ml), and ZnCl2 (80 μm). After 48 h, the conditioned medium was collected, concentrated, and loaded on a 25-ml concanavalin A-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 1 m NaCl; 2mm CaCl2). After washing with buffer A, elution was carried out in the same buffer containing 500 mm α-methyl-d-mannoside. Fractions containing the recombinant enzyme were then dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 0.2 m NaCl; 2 mm CaCl2) and loaded on a 5-ml heparin-Sepharose column. After washing in buffer B, elution was performed in buffer A. Antibody Preparation and Characterization—AS175 was obtained by immunizing a rabbit with recombinant ADAMTS-2 purified by SDS-PAGE. Although the immunization was performed with a full-length protein, the antiserum was specific for the C-terminal domain only, as determined by Western blotting using the various recombinant enzymes. For production of monoclonal antibody, mice were immunized with active and not denatured recombinant ADAMTS-2. Among the tested hybridoma, one (mAb23) produced an antibody (IgG2b) able to recognize native and denatured ADAMTS-2. By using the various recombinant enzymes, it was determined that this antibody is specific for the last TSPI repeat of ADAMTS-2. Further analysis showed that AS175 and mAb23 do not block the aminoprocollagen peptidase activity of ADAMTS-2 and do not display cross-reactivity with ADAMTS-3 and -14. Characterization of the various Recombinant Enzymes—The electrophoretic pattern of the various recombinant enzymes present in the conditioned media and in the two cell layer-associated fractions (see above) was determined by Western blotting analysis using antibodies specific for the M2- or HA-FLAG, the last TSPI repeat (mAb23), or the C-terminal domain (AS175) of ADAMTS-2. The various samples of conditioned medium and cell extracts were also assayed for their aminoprocollagen peptidase activity (see below). In order to identify which forms of the enzyme were responsible for the processing of procollagen substrates, a correlation was calculated between the activity measured in the various samples and the relative abundance of each individual form of recombinant enzymes. Protein Deglycosylation—A crude cell extract containing all the ADAMTS-2 forms detected during our study was incubated with PNGase F or neuraminidase according to manufacturer's protocol. The electrophoretic pattern of ADAMTS-2 before and after treatment was determined by Western blotting using mAb23. Protein Sequencing—For the determination of the N-terminal sequence of the various ADAMTS-2 polypeptides, a highly purified preparation of recombinant enzyme (construct 1) was dialyzed against 1 m ammonium acetate, concentrated by lyophilization, and migrated in a pre-run 7% acrylamide/piperazine diacrylamide gel in 50 mm Tris borate buffer, pH 8.3, containing 0.1% SDS and 0.1 mm thioglycolic acid. After transfer on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (in Tris (50 mm)/borate; pH 8.5) and Coomassie Blue staining (in 40% methanol), the different bands were collected and submitted to six cycles of Edman degradation. For type v collagen sequencing, recombinant type v pNcollagen (19Fichard A. Tillet E. Delacoux F. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30083-30087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was incubated for 18 h with highly purified recombinant ADAMTS-2 and processed as described above. Determination of the N-terminal sequence was performed only for the polypeptide generated by ADAMTS-2 digestion. Purification of Type v Collagen from Bovine Skin—Skin, collected from fetal calves at the third trimester stage, was ground at liquid nitrogen temperature and homogenized with an Ultra Turrax (8000 rpm) in washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 0.25 m sucrose; 2.5 mm NEM; 1 mm PMSF; and 2 mm EDTA). After centrifugation (20,000 × g), the pellets were collected, and the washing procedure was repeated once. Pellets were then suspended and rotated for 18 h at 4 °C in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 2.5 mm NEM;1 mm PMSF; and 2 mm EDTA) containing 0.15 m NaCl. After centrifugation, supernatants were collected, and pellets were further sequentially extracted in the same buffer containing 1 m NaCl and in 0.1 m acetic acid. The various supernatants were dialyzed in 0.1 m acetic acid containing 0.7 m NaCl. After centrifugation (20,000 × g), a large amount of type I collagen was present in the pellets, whereas type v collagen remained in solution. Supernatants were then further dialyzed (0.1 m acetic acid, 1.2 m NaCl). After centrifugation, type v collagen was recovered in the pellet. Even in the most enriched fractions, type v collagen was recovered in low amounts (0.5 to 2% of total protein content, as judged after SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining), the most abundant protein being type I collagen. Inhibition of ADAMTS-2 Activity by α2-Macroglobulin—ADAMTS-2 (∼10 ng, as determined by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-PAGE) was preincubated for 1 h at 37°C with α2-macroglobulin (25 units/ml, 1 unit (40 μg) inhibiting 9.1 μg of trypsin in a standard assay) at varying concentrations (0.025 to 0.4 units). The aminoprocollagen type I was then added, and the peptidase activity was evaluated (see below). The bait and trap mechanism of inhibition of ADAMTS-2 by α2-macroglobulin, resulting in an electrophoretic band shift, was investigated by Western blotting using anti-HA-FLAG antibody. Two types of samples were used. In the first series, purified ADAMTS-2 was incubated alone or with α2-macroglobulin (0.1 unit) in the absence or presence of EDTA. The second series consisted of enzyme (constructs 1A, 2A, or 5A) secreted in culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum as a source for α2-macroglobulin. Procollagen Processing in vitro—The aminoprocollagen peptidase activity of ADAMTS-2 was determined by using either 14C-labeled pNI collagen as substrate (20Colige A. Beschin A. Samyn B. Goebels Y. Van Beeumen J. Nusgens B.V. Lapière C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16724-16730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) or by evaluating the level of processing of unlabeled substrate by Western blotting. Briefly, purified bovine pNI (2 μg) or recombinant pNv homotrimer (0.2 μg) (19Fichard A. Tillet E. Delacoux F. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30083-30087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was incubated at 26 °C with the various enzyme preparations as described previously (20Colige A. Beschin A. Samyn B. Goebels Y. Van Beeumen J. Nusgens B.V. Lapière C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16724-16730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). After 18 h, the samples were denatured and submitted to electrophoresis and were either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. For Western blotting experiments, the pattern of collagen polypeptide was determined by using rabbit antiserum specific for type I or pepsinized type v (NOvOTEC, Lyon, France) collagen. Expression of Recombinant Enzyme—various cell lines were transfected with expression construct 1 (Fig. 1) or empty vector as control. Within a few days after transfection, large amounts of recombinant ADAMTS-2 were produced by most cell lines, as determined by Western blotting analysis of the cell lysate using an anti-M2 FLAG antibody, but only very low levels of aminoprocollagen peptidase activity could be detected (not shown). Because 293 cells were identified as the cells producing the largest amount of active recombinant enzyme, other cell lines were not further used. During the selection process, the amount of recombinant enzyme progressively decreased, as judged from Western blotting analysis using anti-M2 FLAG antibody (Fig. 2A). Most surprisingly, enzymatic activity was not similarly altered (Fig. 2C). A moderate increase of activity was first observed, followed by a small decrease and a sharp increase after 3 weeks of selection. These data suggested that a maturation process was required for full activity. This hypothesis was confirmed by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 2B), using a monoclonal antibody specific for the 4th TSPI repeat. In order to determine which domains of ADAMTS-2 are involved in the regulation of its activity, various recombinant variants (Fig. 1, constructs 2–17) were produced. In a first set of experiments, recombinant enzyme lacking either the PNP domain (construct 2) or the PNP domain and one, two, or three TSPI repeats (constructs 3–5) were created. In a second set, the second potential cleavage site by furin was mutated (construct 7), or various portions of the region at the border between the pro-domain and the metalloproteinase domain were deleted (constructs 8–10). As negative controls, enzyme mutated at the catalytic site (construct 6) or lacking the central domains (construct 11) was also produced. Finally, as a third set of constructs, chimeric enzymes were produced by replacing domains of ADAMTS-2 by the corresponding domains of GON-1, a Caenorhabditis elegans ADAMTS (constructs 12 and 13), or of ADAMTS-14, an enzyme closely related to ADAMTS-2 but displaying only very low aminoprocollagen peptidase activity (constructs 15–17).

The factors governing the intracellular localization of ERas and Rheb are incompletely understood. In the current study, we show by confocal microscopy that ERas is localized to the plasma membrane, whereas Rheb is confined to the endomembranes. Membrane localization of the two proteins was abolished by mutation of the cysteine of the CAAX motif. Membrane targeting was also abolished by a farnesyltransferase inhibitor but not by a geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor. In mouse fibroblasts deficient in either Rce1 (Ras converting enzyme 1) or Icmt (isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase), ERas was mislocalized mainly to the Golgi apparatus, whereas Rheb showed diffuse localization. Mutation of cysteines in the hypervariable region of ERas prevented the plasma membrane localization of ERas, very strongly suggesting that palmitoylation of the cysteines is essential for membrane targeting. The hypervariable region of Rheb does not contain cysteines or polybasic residues, and when it was replaced with the hypervariable region of H-Ras, Rheb displayed plasma membrane localization. These data indicate that ERas shares the same posttranslational modifications with H-Ras and N-Ras and is localized at the plasma membrane. Rheb also shares the same membrane-targeting pathway but because of the absence of palmitoylation is located on endomembranes."

Previously we reported that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates the initiation of the differentiation program in mouse C2C12 myoblasts by controlling the expression of insulin-like growth factor-II in a kinase-independent manner. Here we provide experimental evidence suggesting that a different mode of mTOR signaling regulates skeletal myogenesis at a later stage. In the absence of endogenous mTOR function in C2C12 cells treated with rapamycin, a kinase-inactive mTOR fully supports myogenin expression, but causes a delay in contractile protein expression. Myoblasts fuse to form nascent myotubes in the absence of kinase-active mTOR, whereas the formation of mature myotubes by further fusion requires the catalytic activity of mTOR. Therefore, the two stages of myocyte fusion are molecularly separable at the level of mTOR signaling. In addition, our data suggest that a factor secreted into the culture medium is responsible for mediating the function of mTOR in regulating the late-stage fusion leading to mature myotubes. Furthermore, taking advantage of the unique features of cells stably expressing a mutant mTOR, we have performed cDNA microarray analysis to compare global gene expression profiles between mature and nascent myotubes, the results of which have implicated classes of genes and revealed candidate regulators in myotube maturation or functions of mature myotubes.

Whereas myoblast fusion has been recognized as a tightly regulated process important for mammalian muscle development, the regulatory mechanisms are not well understood at the molecular level. Recently, studies of calcium signaling in mammalian muscle growth have provided insights into the regulation of myoblast fusion, and revealed two distinct stages of fusion controlled by separate molecular pathways, the initial myoblast-myoblast fusion to form nascent myotubes with limited number of myonuclei and subsequent myoblast-myotube fusion resulting in myotube size increase (7Horsley V.

Here we present evidence that a distinct mTOR function controls myogenesis at the myotube maturation stage, which is mechanistically separable from the role of mTOR in the earlier events of differentiation. In contrast to mTOR regulation of the initiation of differentiation as marked by myogenin expression and the formation of nascent myotubes, which is independent of mTOR kinase activity, a second-stage myocyte fusion that leads to mature myotubes requires kinase activity of mTOR. Our observations also suggest that a secreted factor is responsible for mediating the function of mTOR in the second-stage fusion. Furthermore, gene expression profile analyses have led to the identification of genes differentially expressed during myotube maturation, which potentially define the molecular signatures of mature myotubes and provide candidates for the target of mTOR regulation during myotube maturation. Antibodies and Other Reagents—Anti-FLAG M2, anti-troponin T antibodies, and gelatin solution were from Sigma. All secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImunoResearch Labs. The MF20 anti-sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MHC) and F5D anti-myogenin antibodies were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the NICHD, National Institutes of Health and maintained by The University of Iowa, Department of Biological Sciences. The anti-tubulin antibody was a gift from Dr. V. Gelfand. Serum and G418 were from Invitrogen. Rapamycin was from Calbiochem. Cell Culture and Establishment of Stable Cell Lines—C2C12 myoblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 7% CO2. For differentiation, cells were plated on tissue culture plates coated with 0.2% gelatin and grown to 100% confluence, changed into DM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% horse serum), and replenished with fresh DM daily for 3-4 days. For stable expression in cells, various mTOR cDNAs were inserted into the pIRESneo vector (Clontech) at the NotI site, containing a sequence encoding the FLAG epitope at the 5′ end. C2C12 cells were transfected by pIRESneo-mTOR using FuGENE 6 (Roche). After 48 h, the cells were trypsinized and seeded into 10-cm plates at various densities in growth medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418. After 7-10 days, colonies were picked and expanded, and the expression of FLAG-mTOR protein was examined by Western analysis. Upon confirming the recombinant protein expression, each cell line was examined for its ability to differentiate in the absence and presence of rapamycin. Approximately 60% of all clones for both RR- and RR/KI-mTOR retained the ability to differentiate, and among them most differentiated in the presence of rapamycin. Immunofluorescence Microscopy and Quantitative Analyses of Myocytes—C2C12 myoblasts or myotubes grown on tissue culture plates were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde (in phosphate-buffered saline), permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, and then incubated with MF-20 antibody (in 3% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-mouse IgG antibody (in 3% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline), with 4,5-diamidino-2-phenylindole (4 μg/ml) whenever applicable. The stained cells were examined with a Leica inverted fluorescence microscope. Fluorescent images were recorded with a CCD camera using SPOT version 3.2.4 software (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). The average number of nuclei per myotube was generated from 100 or so randomly chosen MHC-positive cells containing two or more nuclei. The percentage of myotubes containing 5 or more nuclei was calculated from similar sampling as above. The fusion index was calculated from the ratio of nuclei number in myocytes with two or more nuclei versus the total number of nuclei. All data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. (n ≥ 3). Student's t tests were performed for comparisons, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. cDNA Microarray—Microarray analysis was carried out using the NIA 15K cDNA chips (containing ∼15,000 mouse cDNAs) developed by the National Institute on Aging (30Tanaka T.S. Jaradat S.A. Lim M.K. Kargul G.J. Wang X. Grahovac M.J. Pantano S. Sano Y. Piao Y. Nagaraja R. Doi H. Wood 3rd, W.H. Becker K.G. Ko M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9127-9132Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) and manufactured by the Keck Biotechnology Center, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Total RNA was isolated from RR/KI44 cells grown on 60-mm plates using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) following the manual. Probes for hybridization were generated according to the TIGR protocols (www.tigr.org/tdb/microarray/protocolsTIGR.shtml). Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA was used to generate aminoallyl-modified cRNA, which was then labeled with Cy3 or Cy5. More than 200 pmol of dye incorporation per sample and less than 50 of nucleotides/dye ratio were used as criteria for acceptable quality of the probes. The cRNA from 0 h was labeled with Cy3 and those from other time points were labeled with Cy5, and vice versa (dye swap). Microarray hybridizations were also carried out according to the TIGR protocols. For each experimental point, 6 hybridizations were performed, which included three independent RNA samples and dye swap for each sample. Microarray Data Acquisition and Analysis—Hybridization images were acquired by using a GenePix 4000B scanner with GenePix Pro 6.0 software. After analyzing each spot in the slides for quality control, Cy3 and Cy5 intensities with foreground and background values formed GenePix Result (gpx) data files, which were used for statistical analysis. Data were imported to the R software environment (www.R-project.org) and analyzed. Once background subtracted Cy3 or Cy5 intensities were acquired, spots with median intensity less than 2 × S.D. of background of each block were filtered out. Regional Lowess (locally weighted polynomial regression) normalization was performed using the R/maanova package. Analysis of variance test was performed to obtain the genes that displayed differential expression at least at one time point (24, 48, or 72 h) compared with 0 h (p < 0.01). Hierarchical clustering of the data were performed using the self-organizing map algorithm in the GeneSpring software package (Silicon Genetics, Inc.). Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated as described for the microarray procedures. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen). qRT-PCR was performed on an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR green chemistry in a MicroAmp 96-well reaction plate following the manufacturer's protocols. Actin β, which was unchanged (0.9 to 1.1-fold) in all the microarray data, was used as the reference to obtain the relative -fold change for target samples using the comparative CT method. In short, CT difference (ΔCT) between target sample and Actin β at each time point was obtained and the difference of ΔCT (ΔΔCT) between 0 h and another time point was calculated. The relative -fold change using 0 h as control was obtained using the formula 2-ΔΔCT. All the PCR primers used in this study (Table I) were confirmed to have equal efficiency as the actin β primers, thus validating the comparative CT method.Table ISequences of primers for qRT-PCRGeneForward primerReverse primerActin β5′-TTGCTGACAGGATGCAGAAG-3′5′-ATCCACATCTGCTGGAAGGT-3′Igf-25′-AAGTCGATGTTGGTGCTTCT-3′5′-GTCCGAACAGACAAACTGAA-3′SerpinB1A5′-GAGTGCAGATCTCTTTAGCA-3′5′-TAGCTATGCCTCCTGTAGCA-3′Bop5′-AACTGGCATGCTGGTCACAT-3′5′-AGCTCCATCTCTGTCTGCAT-3′Scd25′-GGAGAACATCTTGGTTTCCA-3′5′-GAGAGCCATGCAATCGATGA-3′Gpx35′-GGGAGAAAGAGCAGAAATTC-3′5′-CCAGGAACTTCTCAAAGTTC-3′Cyclin G5′-CTTGCCATTTGAGAGGAGAA-3′5′-TTGGATCTCCAACGCAAGGA-3′Adamts15′-TCCACATGCAAGAAGATGTC-3′5′-GAAAGCTGCCATTGTTTCTG-3′ Open table in a new tab C2C12 Cells Supported by a Kinase-inactive mTOR Form Smaller Myotubes—Previously we showed that a rapamycin-resistant and kinase-inactive mTOR was able to support C2C12 differentiation in the presence of rapamycin by inducing normal IGF-II expression and phenotypic differentiation (27Erbay E.

To facilitate further studies we established C2C12 cell lines stably expressing the rapamycin-resistant mTOR mutant (S2035T (19Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar); designated “RR”), and separately, the RR mutant also carrying a kinase-inactive mutation (D2357E) (designated “RR/KI”). Although the mechanism of rapamycin-resistance is not yet clear and rapamycin is unlikely to directly inhibit the kinase activity of mTOR (12Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K. Oshiro N. Hidayat S.

Most of the experiments reported hereafter were performed in the presence of rapamycin, taking advantage of the “chemical knock-out” of mTOR by rapamycin. To eliminate the influence of clonal variation, several independent C2C12 cell clones expressing either RR-mTOR or RR/KI-mTOR were used in most experiments. Multiple clones of RR- and RR/KI-mTOR cells differentiated normally as monitored by the formation of MHC-positive myotubes by 72 h of serum deprivation (representative results from two independent clones for each mTOR mutant are shown in Fig. 1A). FLAG-tagged recombinant mTOR was expressed at similar levels in various stable clones (Fig. 1B). Expression of the recombinant mTOR had no detectable positive or dominant negative effect on differentiation. This was expected because the recombinant mTOR proteins were at a level comparable or lower than that of the endogenous mTOR (data not shown). Both the RR- and RR/KI-mTOR cells differentiated in the presence of rapamycin, confirming our previous observations with transient expression of the same mTOR proteins (27Erbay E. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36079-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It was apparent, however, that the RR/KI-mTOR cells did not behave identically to the RR-mTOR cells: rapamycin treatment reduced the size of RR/KI-mTOR myotubes (Fig. 1A). Quantification of the myotube size by the average number of nuclei per myotube is shown in Fig. 1C. We did not notice this difference earlier in the transiently transfected cells (27Erbay E. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36079-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), likely because of a combination of lower transfection efficiency, slower rate of differentiation in those cells, and insufficient time to allow RR-mTOR myotubes to fully mature and to be distinguished from RR/KI-mTOR myotubes (see Fig. 4, below).Fig. 4Kinase-inactive mTOR cells form nascent myotubes but not mature myotubes. A, RR-mTOR (clone 9) and RR/KI-mTOR (clone 21) cells were differentiated in the presence of 100 nm rapamycin. The cells were fixed and stained for MHC at the times indicated. The scale bar represents 100 μm. Similar results were obtained in other RR and RR/KI clones. The average nuclei number per myotube (B) and the fusion index (C) were measured for cells shown in A. Black and gray bars represent RR and RR/KI cells, respectively. Data shown are the average results of three independent experiments with error bars representing S.D. Statistically significant difference was found in fusion index between RR and RR/KI at 48 h by Student's t test (*, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Early Differentiation Marker Myogenin Is Expressed Normally in Kinase-inactive mTOR Cells—In search for a mechanistic explanation for the aforementioned morphological difference, we studied the differentiation program closely in these stable cells. We first examined the expression of the myogenic regulatory factor myogenin. Myogenin is considered one of the early markers of myoblast differentiation. As shown in Fig. 2, myogenin protein expression was induced in differentiating C2C12 cells and reached its maximal level by 48 h of differentiation, and rapamycin treatment abolished its expression. The myogenin expression profile in the RR-mTOR cells was similar to that in the parental cells, and rapamycin treatment had little effect, confirming the rapamycin-resistant nature of this mutant. Likewise, the RR/KI cells displayed a similar myogenin expression pattern, with or without rapamycin. Because myogenin expression signifies the beginning of the differentiation program, this observation suggests that the mTOR kinase-defective cells entered the differentiation program normally. We next examined the expression of the contractile protein MHC, which typically appeared around 48 h during differentiation. Again, both in the presence and absence of rapamycin, the RR-mTOR cells displayed normal MHC expression patterns (Fig. 3), suggesting that rapamycin-resistant mTOR fully rescued the differentiation program from rapamycin inhibition. On the other hand, the expression of MHC was delayed in the RR/KI-mTOR cells upon treatment by rapamycin, and it eventually (24 h later) reached a maximal level similar to that in the absence of rapamycin (Fig. 3). We also assessed the expression of another contractile protein, troponin T. Similarly, the RR/KI-mTOR cells displayed a delayed troponin T expression profile in the presence of rapamycin, whereas the RR cells expressed troponin T within a normal time frame with or without rapamycin treatment (Fig. 3). All the Western blots shown in Figs. 2 and 3 were from one clone for each mTOR construct; several other clones were examined and yielded similar results (data not shown). C2C12 Cells Supported by a Kinase-inactive mTOR Form Nascent Myotubes, but Not Mature Myotubes—We next took a closer look at the myotube formation process in the mTOR-expressing cells, and asked whether the smaller myotube size in RR/KI-mTOR cells merely reflected a delay in differentiation, as the delayed expression of contractile proteins might have suggested. This appeared not to be the case, as clearly shown in Fig. 4. When the two different types of cultures were compared in the presence of rapamycin (and therefore in the absence of endogenous mTOR function), the RR/KI-mTOR myotubes were permanently arrested at a smaller size; they did not grow significantly even after two more days in differentiation medium and never reached the normal size (Fig. 4A) as quantified by the average number of nuclei per myotube (Fig. 4B). In the absence of rapamycin, the rate and extent of myotube formation were indistinguishable between RR/KI-mTOR and RR-mTOR cells (data not shown). It was possible that differentiation of the RR/KI cells in the presence of rapamycin was overall impaired, resulting in less cells fusing to form myotubes. We therefore measured the fusion index, defined as the percentage of total nuclei in myocytes that contained two or more nuclei. The formation of MHC-positive myotubes in RR/KI-mTOR cultures occurred slightly slower than in RR-mTOR cultures; this is reflected by the lower fusion index of RR/KI-mTOR cells at 48 h (Fig. 4C), which is consistent with the observation that contractile protein expression was delayed in the same cells (Fig. 3). However, by 72 h the fusion index became indistinguishable between the two types of cells (Fig. 4C). We examined the fusion index for several independent clones of RR-mTOR and RR/KI-mTOR cells, and the results are summarized in Table II. Typically, both RR and RR/KI cells reached ∼40% fusion around 72 h, with variations of 6% or less among different cell lines; rapamycin treatment had no obvious effect on the degree of fusion in either type of cells. Apparently, in RR/KI cells under rapamycin treatment the total number of myotubes was higher, which compensated for the smaller size of these myotubes. Taken together, it is evident that cells supported by RR/KI-mTOR can enter the differentiation program normally and form nascent myotubes, but further fusion that gives rise to mature myotube size is impaired in these cells. Hence, these two stages of myocyte fusion are separable, and regulated by distinct mTOR signaling mechanisms.Table IIFusion index for C2C12 cells stably expressing RR-mTOR and RR/KI-mTORFusion indexNo rapamycinWith rapamycin%Parental C2C1239.2 ± 2.90RR244.8 ± 1.143.7 ± 1.6RR939.5 ± 2.539.4 ± 2.9RR1240.9 ± 3.140.1 ± 3.6RR/KI940.9 ± 3.540.0 ± 3.1RR/KI2139.2 ± 3.038.3 ± 3.4RR/KI4444.2 ± 2.943.9 ± 3.0RR/KI5545.2 ± 3.945.8 ± 3.2 Open table in a new tab mTOR Regulates a Secreted Factor(s) Required for Myotube Maturation—Horsley et al.

The endogenous Tm-Tn complex was selectively removed from myofibrils and replaced with recombinant wild-type or mutant proteins. Successful depletion and reconstitution steps were verified by SDS-gel electrophoresis and by the loss and regain of Ca2+-dependent regulation of ATPase activity. Five Tm mutations were chosen for this study: the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) mutations E62Q, E180G, and L185R and the dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) mutations E40K and E54K. Through the use of this new depletion/reconstitution method, the functional consequences of these mutations were determined utilizing myofibrillar ATPase measurements. The results of our studies showed that 1) depletion of >80% of Tm-Tn from myofibrils resulted in a complete loss of the Ca2+-regulated ATPase activity and a significant loss in the maximal ATPase activity, 2) reconstitution of exogenous wild-type Tm-Tn resulted in complete regain in the calcium regulation and in the maximal ATPase activity, and 3) all HCM-associated Tm mutations increased the Ca2+ sensitivity of ATPase activity and all had decreased abilities to inhibit ATPase activity. In contrast, the DCM-associated mutations both decreased the Ca2+ sensitivity of ATPase activity and had no effect on the inhibition of ATPase activity. These findings have demonstrated that the mutations which cause HCM and DCM disrupt discrete mechanisms, which may culminate in the distinct cardiomyopathic phenotypes.

This Tn-regulated cooperative movement of Tm during contraction and relaxation is thought to occur via a multiple-state conformational change, directly regulating the availability of actin for myosin binding (1McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Because of the cooperative nature of contractile protein function, an alteration in any one of the sarcomeric proteins could cause cardiac dysfunction, such as those found in patients suffering from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).HCM is a disease of the heart characterized by unexplained cardiac hypertrophy, myocyte disarray, and fibrosis. Considered a disease of the sarcomere, HCM is caused by hundreds of mutations in the genes encoding major cardiac contractile proteins (2Van Driest S.L. Ommen S.R. Tajik A.J. Gersh B.J. Ackerman M.J. Mayo Clin. Proc. 2005; 80: 463-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Currently, eight mutations in α-Tm have been implicated in the pathogenesis of HCM, including L185R and E62Q (3Van Driest S.L. Ackerman M.J. Ommen S.R. Shakur R. Will M.L. Nishimura R.A. Tajik A.J.

The L185R mutation was first identified in an 8-year-old girl, whose sudden death and subsequent investigation lead to the discovery of a novel HCM-associated Tm mutation (4Van Driest S.L. Will M.L.

This malignant mutation also caused the death of her younger brother at age 6. The E62Q mutation was also identified by investigation of the family members of a childhood sudden death victim (5Jongbloed R.J. Marcelis C.L. Doevendans P.A. Schmeitz-Mulkens J.M. Van Dockum W.G.

In that family all of the children who carried the mutation (4 of 5) died before reaching the age of 20. Both HCM-associated Tm mutations are unique, not only because of the severe phenotype but due to their positions in the Tm molecule. These two mutations lie in the outermost regions of the coiled-coil structure, where they do not have any interactions in the Tm dimer, unlike the other HCM-causing mutations, which are located in the Tm dimer interface where they participate in the stabilization of the Tm molecule through hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions.DCM is a disease of the heart characterized by dilatation and impaired contraction of the left or both ventricles. Autosomal dominant DCM is the most common heritable form and accounts for 56% of all familial DCMs (6Mestroni L. Rocco C. Gregori D. Sinagra G. Di Lenarda A. Miocic S. Vatta M. Pinamonti B.

The E40K mutation was identified in a child who was diagnosed with DCM at 3 months of age. Aggressive medical intervention kept her alive long enough for a heart transplant at age 10. The E54K mutation was identified in a young man with a family history of heart failure. He was diagnosed with DCM at age 26 and died a year later despite aggressive medical therapy and implantation of a defibrillator.Although identified in two clinically different diseases, all four of these new cardiomyopathic mutations cause an increase in net positive charge on the surface of Tm, which may contribute to severe forms of cardiomyopathies (8Olson T.M.

Aside from being located in the troponin T (TnT) binding region, L185R is located right next to serine 186, an amino acid identified to be least stable for the α-helical structure in that particular position (9Tripet B.

The use of this particular method to deplete endogenous Tm and the Tn complex (Tm-Tn) from myofibrils has never been reported.Here we report for the first time: 1) the successful depletion of Tm-Tn from myofibrils, 2) the near complete reconstitution of exogenous Tm-Tn, and 3) the use of myofibrillar ATPase activity assays to investigate the functional consequences of these HCM- and DCM-associated Tm mutations using this new preparation. All mutant and wild-type Tms used in this study were bacterially expressed with the alanine-serine extension to the amino terminus to mimic acetylation (15Monteiro P.B. Lataro R.C. Ferro J.A. de Castro Reinach F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10461-10466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type Tm with the alanine-serine extension (ASWT) was selected over the wild-type Tm without the extension (WT), based on previous reports (15Monteiro P.B. Lataro R.C. Ferro J.A. de Castro Reinach F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10461-10466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and reconstitution experiments conducted in this study (see Fig. 5).The results of the present study have shown that depletion of >80% of Tm-Tn from myofibrils resulted in complete loss of the Ca2+ regulated ATPase activity and a significant loss in the maximal ATPase activity. The reconstitution of exogenous ASWT Tm-Tn restored the regulatory activity and the maximal ATPase activity at high [Ca2+]. The Ca2+ sensitivities of the ATPase activity measurements were increased by all HCM-causing mutations, and all mutants showed decreased ability to inhibit ATPase activity at low [Ca2+]. The DCM-associated Tm mutations E40K and E54K both decreased the Ca2+ sensitivity of ATPase activity. In contrast to the HCM mutants, the DCM mutants did not affect the inhibition of ATPase activity. Furthermore, in light of the novel results, which show the loss of inhibition in HCM Tm mutants, this method may be more sensitive than reconstituted actomyosin ATPase assays. These findings have demonstrated that the Tm mutations, which cause HCM and DCM, disrupt discrete mechanisms, which may explain the manifestation of divergent cardiomyopathic phenotypes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and Purification of Recombinant Tms and TnsHuman cardiac α-Tm cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR of human heart mRNA. Verified full-length cardiac Tm cDNA was then cloned into the pET3d vector for protein expression. Mutant Tms were obtained by a primer-directed PCR method, and successful mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing. Tms were purified utilizing a previously described method (16Hilario E. da Silva S.L. Ramos C.H. Bertolini M.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4132-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) but with steeper elution gradients. Briefly, bacterially expressed and extracted Tms were purified on a DE-52 column. Tm was eluted with a KCl gradient, and the semi-purified Tm was then further purified on a hydroxyapatite column at room temperature. Pure Tm was eluted with a sodium phosphate gradient. All steps were performed at 4 °C except the hydroxyapatite column chromatography. The >95% purity of the isolated Tms was determined by SDS-PAGE. Human cardiac TnT, troponin I (TnI), and troponin C (TnC) were all bacterially expressed and purified separately by standard methods routinely used in this laboratory (17Gomes A.V. Guzman G. Zhao J.

(21Solaro R.J. Pang D.C. Briggs F.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 245: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Myofibril preparations stored in 50% glycerol in -20 °C were first washed to remove the glycerol by resuspension in ice-cold wash buffer (60 mm KCl, 10 mm MOPS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.1) to ∼3mg/mlin a 30-ml Corex open top glass tube. Myofibrils were spun down at 750 × g for 6 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant containing glycerol and wash buffer was suctioned and collected in a vacuum trap to minimize myofibril loss. Washed myofibrils were then depleted of endogenous Tm and Tn by repetitive resuspension to ∼2 mg/ml in depletion buffer (2 mm sodium carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.0) and centrifugation (see Fig. 4). All buffers used in depletion were chilled on ice before and during the depletion steps. Depletion washes cause swelling of the myofibrils, which is clearly visible in the transparency and volume change in the myofibrils, with each successive wash. A small percentage of non-depleting “clumpy” myofibrils are sometimes present and can be identified by the differences in transparency. These clumpy myofibrils are left in the depleted sample mixture because it represents a very small fraction of the total depleted myofibril.FIGURE 4Schematic diagram of myofibril depletion and reconstitution steps. For depletion, myofibrils were first depleted of endogenous Tm-Tn through repetitive washes in depletion buffer, which was performed by resuspension of the myofibrils to ∼2 mg/ml in depletion buffer, then centrifugation in a 30-ml open-top glass Corex tube at 750 × g for 6 min. Depleted myofibrils were then washed in reconstitution buffer once to exchange out any remaining depletion buffer and reconstituted with Tm-Tn. For reconstitution, 5 mg of depleted myofibrils were incubated with 4.5 μm Tm-Tn in 2-ml low adhesion microcentrifuge tubes at 4 °C for 1 h while rotating. Excess Tm-Tn was removed from the myofibrils by washing in wash buffer, and reconstituted myofibrils were then utilized for ATPase activity measurements.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reconstitution of Tm-Tn into Depleted Myofibrils—Depleted myofibrils (DM) were resuspended to ∼5 mg/ml in reconstitution buffer (120 mm KCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 7 mm MgCl2, 6 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm K2ATP), spun down, and resuspended in reconstitution buffer again to ensure that most of the depletion buffer had been removed. Exogenous Tms and Tns, which had been separately pre-dialyzed into reconstitution buffer, were prepared for reconstitution by mixing in equimolar concentrations 30 min before the reconstitution procedure. Five mg of depleted myofibrils were reconstituted with exogenous Tm-Tn by incubation with 4.5 μm Tm-Tn in 2-ml low adhesion microcentrifuge tubes (see Fig. 4). Molecular weights used for concentration calculations are 65,733.4 (ASWT), 65,417 (WT), 65,731.4 (E40K, E54K, E62Q), 65,588 (E180G), 65,819.4 (L185R), and 76,751.4 (Tn complex). The myofibril and protein mixture of 2 ml final volume in 2-ml microcentrifuge tubes were incubated for 1 h in a 4°C cold room while rotating to reduce settling out of the myofibrils. After 1 h, myofibrils were spun down, and supernatant was removed and washed 1× in a wash buffer to remove excess Tm-Tn, then gently resuspended again in the wash buffer to >2.5 mg/ml concentration for use in ATPase activity assay. Myofibril concentrations were determined by the Brad-ford assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard, utilizing the Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce).Myofibrillar ATPase Activity AssayMyofibrillar ATPase activity assays were performed as previously described (22Szczesna-Cordary D. Guzman G. Ng S.S. Zhao J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3535-3542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Assay sample tubes composed of equal total concentrations of myofibrils (100 μl myofibril volume) and various Ca2+ buffers at the final volume of 0.975 ml were preincubated for exactly 5 min in a 30 °C water bath, and the reaction was started with 25 μl of 100 mm K2ATP. The ATPase reaction rate was optimized to be linear between 10 and 15 min; therefore, 12 min of incubation at 30 °C was used. The reaction was stopped with 200 μl of 30% trichloroacetic acid. Maximal Ca+2-induced activities for depletion and reconstitution optimizations were measured in high or low [Ca2+] buffers (50 mm KCl, 25 m m MOPS, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.05 mm CaCl2 (for high [Ca2+]) or 0.05 mm EGTA (for low [Ca2+]). The Ca2+ sensitivity of ATPase activity measurements were performed in various pCa buffers (35 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, with varying Ca2+ concentrations ranging from pCa 9.1 to 5).ElectrophoresisSDS-PAGE was performed according to the procedure of Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). For all densitometric analyses, ∼10 μg of myofibril samples were loaded into 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoretic separation, the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and gel band densitometry was measured using Scion gel analysis software.RESULTSMethod for Depletion of the Endogenous Tm-Tn Complex—To determine the effects of removal of endogenous Tm-Tn from myofibrils and to optimize the conditions for maximal depletion, myofibrils were washed in a depletion buffer numerous times, and the effects of the washes on maximal activity and inhibition were investigated. Fig. 1 shows the ATPase activity of PCM washed multiple times ranging from 5 to 13 washes, assayed in the presence or absence of Ca2+. In comparison to undepleted PCM, the ATPase activity in the presence of Ca2+ decreased after 10 washes, whereas the ATPase activity in the absence of Ca2+ comparatively increased, suggesting an increase in the amount of regulatory units removed from the myofibrils. The ATPase activity at high [Ca2+]is81 ± 5.8% (n = 3) of PCM for myofibrils that had been washed 8 times and is only 63 ± 7.6% (n = 5) for myofibrils that had been washed 13 times. The net regulated activity was measured to be 96 ± 4.6% (n = 7) for PCM, 11 ± 1.5% (n = 3) for 8 washes, and 2 ± 7.8% (n = 5) for 13 washes. Decreases in the net regulated activity is indicative of desensitization of the myofibrils to Ca2+, which in this method is attributed to the depletion of regulatory units Tm and Tn. Thirteen washes in the depletion buffer yielded the lowest net regulated activity but not the highest activity levels. Because the best maximal activity in the presence of Ca2+ and the smallest remaining net activity were achieved between 8 and 10 washes, 8 was chosen as the optimal number of washes for depletion of myofibrils for all subsequent experiments.FIGURE 1Maximal ATPase activity measurements of myofibrils, which have been depleted of its endogenous Tm-Tn. Myofibrils were washed in depletion buffer 5-13 times to remove the endogenous Tm-Tn, and the extent of depletion was compared with un-depleted myofibrils (PCM), which had 0 depletion washes. Loss of endogenous regulatory units, Tm-Tn, were assessed by the amount of ATPase activity at high (0.05 mm Ca2+) and low (0.05 mm EGTA) [Ca2+], and the fraction of net activity (activity at high [Ca2+], activity at low [Ca2+]) remaining after the depletion washes. The results are the mean ± S.D. of activity measurements, which have been normalized to PCM activity at high [Ca2+]. The experiments were conducted the number of times shown (n) in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Method for Tm-Tn Reconstitution into Depleted Myofibrils—To assess the effects of reconstitution of exogenous Tm-Tn on the depleted myofibrils and to optimize the conditions for the best reconstitution, DM were incubated with various concentrations of recombinant ASWT Tm-Tn. DM that had been treated with [Tm-Tn] of less than 3.6 μm did not regain activity or regulation back to the level of PCM (data not shown). DM that had been treated with 4.5-6.8 μm Tm-Tn regained its activity in the presence of Ca2+ and also the ability to inhibit ATPase activity in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2). Quantitative analysis of SDS-PAGE densitometry and myofibrillar ATPase activity showed that the extent of reconstitution increased correspondingly with the increase in the [Tm-Tn] used in the reconstitution treatments. With 3.6 μm Tm-Tn treatment, the ATPase activity in the presence of Ca2+ was 69 ± 8.3 nmol Pi/mg/min, and the activity in the absence of Ca2+ was 8 ± 6.2 nmol Pi/mg/min. When the depleted myofibrils were treated with 4.5, 5.4, or 6.8 μm Tm-Tn, the ATPase activities in the presence of Ca2+ were 80 ± 13.8, 87 ± 21.8, and 88 ± 6.1 nmol Pi/mg/min, respectively; the ATPase activities in the absence of Ca2+ were 11 ± 2.8, 11 ± 4.8, and 11 ± 2.8 nmol Pi/mg/min, respectively. Although the amount of activation and inhibition was not significantly different from PCM, the values for 4.5 μm Tm-Tn was the closest to that of PCM, and qualitative analysis suggests that when myofibrils are treated with [Tm-Tn] greater than 4.5 μm, the activities are higher than PCM in the presence of Ca2+. Therefore, 4.5 μm [Tm-Tn] was chosen for all other reconstituted myofibrillar ATPase activity experiments.FIGURE 2Maximal ATPase activity measurements of myofibrils that have been depleted and reconstituted with recombinant Tm-Tn. The activity of un-depleted myofibrils (PCM) is compared with that of DM which have been reconstituted with increasing concentrations of recombinant human cardiac ASWT Tm-Tn. Five mg of DM were incubated with 0-6.8 μm Tm-Tn in microcentrifuge tubes for 1 h at 4 °C while rotating. The extent of Tm-Tn reconstitution was determined by the regain of regulation of ATPase activity at low [Ca2+] and the increase in maximal ATPase activity at high [Ca2+]. The results represent the mean ± S.D. of calculated ATPase activity rates of reconstituted myofibrils. The experiments were conducted the number of times shown (n) in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Extent of Depletion and Reconstitution of ASWT and Mutant Tm—To determine the extent of depletion and reconstitution, samples of prepared myofibrils were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Densitometry of Tm versus essential light chain was utilized to quantify the amount of Tm depleted and reconstituted. Shown in Table I is the percentage of Tm remaining in DM and the percentages of Tm in reconstituted myofibrils when compared with PCM. To examine the effects of the depletion and reconstitution methods on other myofibrillar proteins, myofibril samples were reduced and separated on a 4-20% Tris-glycine gradient gel (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 shows that the majority of the visible TnT, Tm, TnI, and TnC were removed with the depletion process, but none of the other proteins appeared to be affected. After reconstitution, all of the Tns returned to the level of PCM. The familial HCM mutant Tms E180G and L185R consistently ran slightly faster than the other mutants (Fig. 3).TABLE ONESummary of myofibrillar ATPase activity measurementspCa50nMaximum ATPase activity% of Tm in depleted/reconstituted myofibrilspCa 5.0pCa 9.1nHnmol Pi/mg/minPCM6.68 ± 0.118677.97 ± 1.887.91 ± 2.881.44 ± 0.17100DMN/A671.25 ± 11.3475.13 ± 12.69N/A18.6 ± 3.5WT6.65 ± 0.037379.67 ± 2.9118.70 ± 5.1aP < 0.05 when compared to PCM.1.16 ± 0.1891.3 ± 6.5ASWT6.57 ± 0.085683.81 ± 6.9112.39 ± 2.43aP < 0.05 when compared to PCM.1.36 ± 0.2693.0 ± 5.6E62Q6.78 ± 0.119bP < 0.05, when compared to ASWT.491.07 ± 10.2019.42 ± 6.08bP < 0.05, when compared to ASWT.1.28 ± 0.2397.4 ± 3.9L185R6.97 ± 0.038cP < 0.0001, when compared to ASWT.491.11 ± 5.8222.59 ± 4.86bP < 0.05, when compared to ASWT.1.10 ± 0.1593.5 ± 6.9E180G7.01 ± 0.181dP < 0.001, when compared to ASWT.595.42 ± 12.3928.78 ± 4.04cP < 0.0001, when compared to ASWT.0.76 ± 0.0492.8 ± 2.8E40K6.38 ± 0.091bP < 0.05, when compared to ASWT.585.06 ± 21.479.91 ± 3.821.28 ± 0.13103.3 ± 3.8E64K6.42 ± 0.088bP < 0.05, when compared to ASWT.588.07 ± 6.4214.71 ± 4.651.84 ± 0.7997.5 ± 10.0a P < 0.05 when compared to PCM.b P < 0.05, when compared to ASWT.c P < 0.0001, when compared to ASWT.d P < 0.001, when compared to ASWT.

Recently, it has been suggested that the uptake or reuptake of secreted heparanase-1 precursor is mediated by cell membrane HSPGs, in particular the syndecans (16Gingis-Velitski S. Zetser A. Kaplan V. Ben-Zaken O. Cohen E. Levy-Adam F. Bashenko Y. Flugelman M.Y. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44084-44092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The experiments reported here confirm a role for HSPGs in heparanase-1 uptake but indicate that these are not the sole elements involved and are not strictly required. Rather, we found that low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) and possibly other receptor-associated protein (RAP)-sensitive receptor(s), as well as mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) receptors are key to this process. Plasmid Construction—Heparanase-1 cDNA was prepared from CaCo2 cell mRNA by reverse transcription-PCR and cloned into pcDNA 3.1/zeo(+) (Invitrogen). QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) was used to mutate all six N-glycosylation Asn residues into Gln residues (ΔS1–6). All constructs were verified by sequencing. Antibodies—The synthetic peptide YGPDVGQPRRKTAKM, corresponding to a sequence in the ∼50-kDa subunit of mature heparanase-1, was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin for immunization. Rabbit anti-heparanase-1 antibodies were affinity-purified on the same peptide coupled to EAH-Sepharose. Mouse monoclonal anti-actin antibody was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Mouse monoclonal antibodies 3G10 (recognizing desaturated glucuronate created by enzymatic cleavage of heparan sulfate with bacterial heparitinase) (17David G. Bai X.M. Van der Schueren B.

Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. David G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7009-7016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared as described previously. Recombinant RAP—His6-RAP (plasmid provided by Dr. T. Willnow) was expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS bacteria (Invitrogen) and purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin column (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. His6-RAP was checked for purity by SDS-PAGE and stored at –80 °C in Tris-buffered saline. Cell Cultures and Transfection—All of the cells used were immortalized cell lines. Wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were derived from wild-type mice. Wild-type HEK 293-T cells, wild-type CHO K1 cells, and MEFs that are genetically deficient in LRP (PEA13) (19Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from ATCC. HS-deficient CHO cells (CHO 677) (20Lidholt K. Weinke J.L. Kiser C.S. Lugemwa F.N. Bame K.J. Cheifetz S.

CHO cells deficient in LRP (CHO 13-5-1) (21FitzGerald D.J. Fryling C.M. Zdanovsky A. Saelinger C.B. Kounnas M. Winkles J.A. Strickland D. Leppla S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1533-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) were provided by Dr. D. FitzGerald (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). MEF deficient in both the cation-independent (∼300-kDa) and cation-dependent (∼46-Da) Man-6-P receptor (22Pohlmann R. Boeker M.W. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27311-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) were provided by Dr. K. von Figura (University of Göttingen, Germany). Cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone). For transient expression studies, cells were grown in 6-well plates and transfected (1 μg of plasmid DNA/well) using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) for 24 h. In experiments in which the secreted protein or the effect of agents had to be analyzed, cells were transfected for 4 h, washed, and cultured for 20 h in serum-free medium with or without the addition of the agent monensin, tunicamycin A (both purchased from Sigma-Aldrich), and His6-RAP. Western Blotting—After removal of the culture medium and several washes, cell extracts were prepared using ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mm EDTA). Cleared cell lysates (and equivalent volumes of the media) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (4–15% gradient gels, Bio-Rad) and transferred to Hybond C-extra membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were probed with the appropriate antibody diluted in blocking buffer (0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry skim milk). Bound antibody was detected with species-specific secondary antibody conjugated to peroxidase (goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse, Bio-Rad) using the ECL detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Heparanase-1 Binding and Uptake Studies—For binding and uptake studies, 0.75 ml of serum-free culture medium, conditioned by transiently heparanase-1-transfected HEK 293-T cells (heparanase-1 medium, containing ∼5 nm of precursor), was added to subconfluent cell cultures (∼400,000 cells) at 4 and 37 °C with or without the addition of heparin (Calbiochem), Man-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate, mannose (Sigma-Aldrich), or His6-RAP. After the indicated lengths of time, the medium was removed, cells were washed, and cell lysates were prepared as described above. Similar experiments with similar results were also conducted with purified heparanase-1 precursor isolated from heparanase-1 medium by heparin-affinity chromatography. To remove cell surface chondroitin sulfate or HS, cells were treated with chondroitinase ABC (0.1 unit/ml) or heparitinase (0.006 unit/ml), respectively (Seikagaku Corp.) for4hat37 °C, washed with serum-free medium, and further incubated with the enzyme in heparanase-1 medium. To distinguish between the membrane-bound and intracellular forms of heparanase-1, cells were treated with 250 μg/ml trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 °C for 15 min. Soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich) was added, and after several washes total cell lysates were prepared as described above. Heparanase Assay—[35S]HS was prepared from metabolically labeled cultured human lung fibroblasts (17David G. Bai X.M. Van der Schueren B. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Lysates from heparanase-1- or mock-transfected cells were incubated with [35S]HS in 30 mm phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) overnight at 37 °C. Digested material was fractionated by SDS-PAGE (4–15% gradient gel) and detected by autoradiography. Endoglycosidase Digestions—Methanol/chloroform-precipitated cell extracts were suspended in 0.5% SDS and 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. For PNGase F digestion (Roche Applied Science) the solution was adjusted to 3% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.6), and 0.5 units of PNGase F. For Endo H digestion (Roche Applied Science) the solution was adjusted to 75 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5), 0.05% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 milliunits of Endo H. Both digestions were incubated overnight at 37 °C followed by Western blotting, as described above. HSPGs Are Not Strictly Required for Heparanase-1 Uptake—HEK 293-T cells that were transiently transfected with heparanase-1 accumulated both the inactive precursor (∼65 kDa) and the mature active form (∼50 kDa) of the enzyme in roughly similar amounts (Fig. 1A, lane 2). The culture medium of these cells contained large amounts of the pro-enzyme but no mature enzyme (Fig. 1A, lane 4). Yet, many other heparanase-1-transfected cells released hardly any pro-enzyme in their culture media (see below for examples). Monensin inhibited the accumulation of processed enzyme (Fig. 1B) and heparanase activity (Fig. 1C) in HEK 293-T cells, consistent with the late endosome/lysosome being the primary heparanase-1-processing organelle (15Zetser A. Levy-Adam F. Kaplan V. Gingis-Velitski S. Bashenko Y. Schubert S. Flugelman M.Y. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2249-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The capacity of cells to internalize secreted heparanase-1 precursor and to convert the internalized protein into an active form of the enzyme was evident from adding spent culture medium, conditioned by heparanase-1-transfected HEK 293-T cells (Fig. 1A), to cultured mammalian cell lines, e.g. wild-type CHO K1 cells (Fig. 1, D and E) and wild-type MEFs (Fig. 1, F and G). Both cell types quickly bound the ∼65-kDa heparanase-1 precursor and progressively converted the precursor into mature ∼50-kDa protein (Fig. 1, D and F). In MEFs, this resulted in markedly enhanced heparanase activity (Fig. 1G). Treating the cells with trypsin removed none of the mature form but, depending on the length of the incubation with precursor, removed most or part of the precursor form of heparanase-1 (Fig. 1E), suggesting that all processing occurs inside the cells. Below, we describe similar transfection and uptake experiments using various cell lines with known receptor deficiencies. Consistent with a possible role for HSPG in heparanase-1 uptake or reuptake, HS-deficient CHO 677 cells (20Lidholt K. Weinke J.L. Kiser C.S. Lugemwa F.N. Bame K.J. Cheifetz S. Massague J. Lindahl U. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) that were transiently transfected with heparanase-1 released large amounts of the ∼65-kDa heparanase-1 precursor into their culture medium (Fig. 2A, lane 4). Heparanase-1-transfected wild-type CHO K1 cells, in contrast, released none (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Compared with wild-type CHO K1 cells, lysates of CHO 677 cells still contained considerable (almost similar) amounts of the ∼50-kDa active enzyme (Fig. 2A, lane 2 versus lane 1). Yet, in comparison with wild-type CHO K1 cells, HS-deficient CHO 677 cells showed a moderate delay in binding and uptake/processing of exogenous, added pro-heparanase-1 (Fig. 2B). Consistently, treatment of wild-type CHO K1 cells with bacterial heparitinase slightly decreased heparanase-1 binding and delayed uptake/processing (Fig. 2C, left panel). The heparitinase digestion was effective, as shown by the appearance of the 3G10 epitope (17David G. Bai X.M. Van der Schueren B. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), decorating discrete bands corresponding to the molecular masses of core proteins of different HSPGs (e.g. ∼65-kDa syndecan-1, ∼60-kDa glypican, ∼35-kDa syndecan-4) (Fig. 2C, right panel). Because CHO 677 cells are deficient in HS but overexpress chondroitin sulfate (20Lidholt K. Weinke J.L. Kiser C.S. Lugemwa F.N. Bame K.J. Cheifetz S. Massague J. Lindahl U. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), we then investigated whether chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans might be responsible for the remaining heparanase-1 binding and uptake, by pretreating CHO 677 cells with chondroitinase ABC. Although the treatment was effective (appearance of a discrete ∼65-kDa band corresponding to the core protein of syndecan-1, a hybrid HS/chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (18Lories V. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. David G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7009-7016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) (Fig. 2D, right panel), we could not detect any effect on heparanase-1 binding and internalization (Fig. 2D, left panel). It had been suggested that added heparin competes with cell surface HSPGs for heparanase-1 binding and thus inhibits uptake (16Gingis-Velitski S. Zetser A. Kaplan V. Ben-Zaken O. Cohen E. Levy-Adam F. Bashenko Y. Flugelman M.Y. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44084-44092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Our data confirmed that the binding and uptake of heparanase-1 can be totally inhibited by the addition of increasing concentrations of heparin (1–50 μg/ml). Yet, inhibition not only occurs in wild-type CHO K1 cells (Fig. 2E, left) but also in HS-deficient CHO 677 cells (Fig. 2E, right), implying that heparin also inhibits heparanase-1 binding to other receptor(s). From all of these data, we conclude that HSPGs are not strictly required for the capture or recapture and internalization of the heparanase-1 precursor and are not the key players in this process. Rather, they may have a role in regulating its efficiency and/or kinetics. LRP Involvement in Heparanase-1 Precursor Uptake—Because the roles of LRP in the uptake of proteases, protease inhibitor complexes, lipoproteins, and lipases are well established (23Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 24Strickland D.K. Ranganathan S. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 1663-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we then tested whether this receptor might be involved in the uptake or reuptake of secreted heparanase-1 precursor. MEFs deficient in LRP (PEA13 cells) (19Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that were transiently transfected with heparanase-1 released large amounts of the ∼65-kDa precursor in their culture medium (Fig. 3A, left panel, lane 4). Transfected wild-type MEFs (which express LRP abundantly), in contrast, released none (Fig. 3A, left panel, lane 3). Comparing LRP-deficient CHO 13-5-1 cells (21FitzGerald D.J. Fryling C.M. Zdanovsky A. Saelinger C.B. Kounnas M. Winkles J.A. Strickland D. Leppla S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1533-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) with wild-type CHO K1 cells yielded similar results (Fig. 3A, right panel). As these data were suggestive of a role for LRP, this role was further assessed by examining the effect of RAP, a receptor-associated protein that inhibits ligand binding to several members of the low density lipoprotein-receptor family. The addition of increasing concentrations of RAP to heparanase-1-transfected MEFs (Fig. 3B) or CHO K1 cells (data not shown) resulted in progressively increasing amounts of the ∼65-kDa heparanase-1 precursor in the culture medium. The addition of RAP to transiently transfected PEA13 cells (Fig. 3C) or CHO 13-5-1 cells (data not shown) also increased the amount of heparanase-1 precursor that these cells released in the culture medium, suggesting that RAP-sensitive receptors other than LRP (e.g. sortilin, very low density lipoprotein receptor, megalin, etc.) might also be involved in heparanase-1 precursor uptake. Yet, RAP is a known ligand for heparin and may bind to HSPGs in some cell types (25Ji Z.S. Mahley R.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 2025-2031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while not binding to HSPGs in cells that produce other, less or differently sulfated forms of HS (26Vassiliou G. Stanley K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15172-15178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of RAP to heparanase-1-transfected CHO 677 cells markedly enhanced the amount of heparanase-1 precursor that these cells released in the culture medium and reduced the amount of mature enzyme in the lysate of the cells (Fig. 3D), indicating that the effect of RAP is not due or solely due to the competition of binding to HSPGs. Consistent with a role for LRP, uptake experiments detected a moderate but clear difference between MEFs and PEA13 cells in the rate of heparanase-1 conversion (Fig. 3E, lane 1 versus lane 3, showing inverted ratios of precursor over mature protein after 120 min of incubation with heparanase-1 precursor at 37 °C). Consistently, the processing of the heparanase-1 precursor by MEFs decreased when RAP was included during the uptake experiment, reducing it to the level of processing by PEA13 cells (Fig. 3E, lanes 2 and 3). At the same time, the precursor associated with MEFs remained more accessible to trypsin in the presence of RAP (Fig. 3F, lanes 3 and 4) than in the absence of RAP (Fig. 3F, lanes 1 and 2), suggesting that the net effect of RAP is reduced uptake and, consequently, conversion. RAP also had a small effect on uptake/processing by PEA13 cells (Fig. 3E, lane 4), confirming that RAP-sensitive receptors other than LRP might also mediate heparanase-1 precursor uptake. The inclusion of RAP moderately reduced the levels of precursor and severely reduced the levels of mature enzyme associating with CHO 677 cells (Fig. 3G), confirming a role for LRP (and possibly other RAP-sensitive receptors) in heparanase-1 binding and uptake and suggesting that this role might be less apparent in the presence of HSPGs. Consistently, increasing concentrations of RAP also progressively reduced the amount of heparanase-1 precursor that became associated with MEFs when these cells were incubated with heparanase-1 at 4 °C (preventing internalization) for 60 min (time sufficient to reach maximal binding), implying that LRP and/or other RAP-sensitive receptors are involved in the binding of the heparanase-1 precursor (Fig. 3H). Man-6-P Receptor Involvement in Heparanase-1 Precursor Uptake—As most of the soluble lysosomal hydrolases are transported via Man-6-P receptors (27Ghosh P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), we then investigated whether this receptor system might also play a role in the capture or recapture of heparanase-1. If so, then heparanase-1 glycosylation should affect the trafficking and activation of the precursor protein. Treatment of heparanase-1-transfected HEK 293-T cells with tunicamycin A (TM) (an inhibitor of N-glycosylation) or replacement of all six Asn residues in the protein that compose sites for N-glycosylation (28Simizu S. Ishida K. Wierzba M.K. Osada H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2697-2703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) by Gln residues resulted in heparanase-1 migrating as only one single band of ∼50 kDa, corresponding to the predicted molecular mass of the nonglycosylated form of proheparanase-1 (Fig. 4, A and B, left panels), and no gain in heparanase activity (Fig. 4, A and B, right panels), suggesting that the maturation of the pro-enzyme is inhibited. These results are in clear contrast to an earlier claim that the N-glycosylation of heparanase-1 is not required for its activation and activity (28Simizu S. Ishida K. Wierzba M.K. Osada H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2697-2703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although we have no formal explanation for this discrepancy, we suggest that the metabolic stability of the (preformed) active enzyme (half-life of ∼30 h) (16Gingis-Velitski S. Zetser A. Kaplan V. Ben-Zaken O. Cohen E. Levy-Adam F. Bashenko Y. Flugelman M.Y. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44084-44092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) may hamper detecting effects of TM on heparanase activity in stably transfected cells (28Simizu S. Ishida K. Wierzba M.K. Osada H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2697-2703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cell extracts of transiently heparanase-1-transfected HEK 293-T cells were then digested in vitro with either PNGase F (cleaving all Asn-linked oligosaccharides) or Endo H (removing only the high mannose and hybrid types of Asn-linked oligosaccharides). Western blots of these digestions (Fig. 4C) revealed that the ∼65-kDa precursor and the ∼50-kDa mature enzyme are equally sensitive to PNGase F and Endo H, both digestions leaving none of the proteins intact and leading to multiple bands (in the case of Endo H, including also major bands that correspond to the molecular masses of the nonglycosylated forms (∼50 kDa for the precursor and ∼43 kDa for the mature enzyme)). A similar result was obtained for the secreted heparanase-1 precursor (data not shown). To ensure that these results were not due to the levels of expression or dependent on the cell type, we repeated these experiments with stably heparanase-1-transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney type II cells, obtaining similar results (Fig. 4D). Inclusion of protease inhibitors during the digestions had no effect on the banding pattern (shown for Endo H in Fig. 4E). Moreover, neither enzyme degraded a heparanase-1-mutant in which all six N-glycosylation Asn residues had been replaced by Gln residues (Fig. 4F). Both enzymes also failed to degrade the nonglycosylated heparanase-1 precursor accumulating in TM-treated cells (not shown), further ensuring that the degradation of the glycosylated precursor was not due to contaminating protease activities. These data imply that most of the Asn-linked oligosaccharides on the precursor and mature form of heparanase-1 are of the non-complex type. Possibly, these contain Man-6-P residues, preventing their conversion to complex carbohydrates. The sole addition of Man-6-P (10 mm) had little or no effect on the uptake and conversion of heparanase-1 precursor by wild-type MEFs (Fig. 5A, lanes 1 and 3). However, in the presence of RAP (2 μm) Man-6-P further inhibited the conversion of heparanase-1 precursor into the mature form (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 2 and 4). A similar combination of Man-6-P and RAP completely prevented the accumulation of mature heparanase-1 in heparitinase-treated MEFs (Fig. 5A, lanes 5–8), and all of the precursor protein associating with these cells was accessible to trypsin (not shown). In contrast, in MEFs that lacked LRP (Fig. 5B) the sole addition of Man-6-P (10 mm) markedly reduced conversion of heparanase-1 precursor; the further addition of RAP had little additional inhibitory effect on this conversion. Similarly, in wild-type CHO K1 cells (Fig. 5C) and in LRP-deficient CHO 13-5-1 cells (Fig. 5D) the combination of Man-6-P and RAP was more effective than either Man-6-P or RAP alone in reducing the conversion of precursor, and in HS-deficient CHO 677 cells (Fig. 5E) it completely inhibited precursor uptake and conversion. Neither glucose-6-phosphate (10 mm) nor mannose (10 mm) had significant effects on uptake and conversion (Fig. 5, C–E). Finally, we also supplied proheparanase-1 to MEFs that lacked Man-6-P receptors (22Pohlmann R. Boeker M.W. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27311-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5F). All of the heparanase-1 precursors associating with these cells remained in precursor form, which was perhaps to be expected, because such MEFs are likely to be deficient in the lysosomal enzymes required for the processing of internalized heparanase-1 precursors. In the absence of RAP, most of this heparanase-1 resisted treatment of the cells with trypsin, confirming that substantial internalization can occur in the absence of Man-6-P receptors. Adding RAP markedly reduced the accumulation of trypsin-resistant (internalized) heparanase-1 precursor in these cells. Significantly, the internalization of heparanase-1 precursor was completely blocked by RAP when these MEFs were pretreated with heparitinase (Fig. 5F, lane 10). As expected, adding Man-6-P had no effect on heparanase-1 uptake by these cells. Together, these data clearly demonstrate that HSPGs, RAP-sensitive receptors, and Man-6-P receptors cooperate in the binding and internalization of heparanase-1 precursor. In this study we show that receptors involved in the binding and internalization of secreted heparanase-1 precursor include HSPGs, LRP, possibly other RAP-sensitive receptor(s), and Man-6-P receptors. Mutant cell lines, undoubtedly deficient in at least one of these receptor systems, indicate that each of these receptors is individually dispensable. Thus, different types of cells are likely to use different combinations of these receptors for regulating their heparanase activities. Persistent uptake and activation of latent heparanase-1 in the absence of HS, i.e. by HS-deficient CHO 677 cells and by heparitinase-treated cells, indicate that HSPGs are not the sole elements involved and are not strictly required for uptake. Moreover, adding RAP to MEFs that lack Man-6-P receptors or adding the combination of RAP and Man-6-P to wild-type MEFs or CHO cells severely reduces internalization of heparanase-1, suggesting that HSPGs, by themselves, are not effective internalization receptors. Yet, CHO 677 cells and heparitinase-treated cells are less effective at internalizing heparanase-1 precursor and are more sensitive to RAP and Man-6-P than are wild-type CHO cells or corresponding control cells, clearly indicating that HSPGs play a significant role in the capture and internalization of heparanase-1. This suggests a scheme whereby HSPGs function in the context of other receptors (i.e. LRP and Man-6-P receptors), facilitating the binding of ligand to these receptors, a recurring theme shared with several other HS-dependent receptor systems. HSPGs can modulate receptor functions by concentrating ligands at the cell surface, presenting ligands to cell-surface receptors or participating in ternary ligand·receptor·HS complexes and stabilizing ligand-receptor interactions. These mechanisms could also apply to the internalization of heparanase-1, but further work is needed to distinguish between multiple additive and truly cooperative binding and internalization mechanisms. In the absence of HS and functional Man-6-P receptors (e.g. CHO 667 cells that are exposed to Man-6-P, or Man-6-P receptor-deficient MEFs that are treated with heparitinase) binding and internalization of heparanase-1 precursor persists at a substantial rate. This residual uptake is totally abolished when RAP is also included, unambiguously identifying LRP and possibly other RAP-sensitive receptors as bona fide and major pro-heparanase-1 internalization receptors. The effects of Man-6-P on precursor internalization, evident in LRP-deficient cells or in the presence of RAP, and indirectly the extreme sensitivity of Man-6-P receptor-deficient MEFs to the combination of heparitinase and RAP indicate that Man-6-P receptors work along with LRP and/or other RAP-sensitive receptors in the internalization of the heparanase-1 precursor. Thus, the various mutants are equally (if not primarily) helpful in demonstrating the participation of the “alternative” receptor systems as they are in showing the contribution of the mutant receptor under question. Multiple different internalization receptors would seem to provide robustness to this uptake mechanism, possibly reflecting a strong need for cells to keep extracellular concentrations of heparanase-1 precursor at low levels. It is not clear to what extent the secretion-recapture route represents a physiological path for cells to direct the heparanase-1 precursor from the endoplasmic reticulum (the site of biosynthesis) to lysosomes, in which it is processed into the mature active form of the enzyme. In most cells with easily detectable endogenous heparanase activity, e.g. nontransfected HEK 293-T cells, heparanase-1 is hardly if at all detectable at the protein level. Possibly, mechanisms for direct sorting from early secretory pathway compartments to lysosomes may be overwhelmed in instances of excessive heparanase-1 production as in transfected cells. In that case it remains to be established whether such direct sorting of heparanase-1 is mediated by the same receptors that were implicated here in the uptake or reuptake of the secreted heparanase-1 precursor, but LRP and in particular Man-6-P receptors are logical candidates. Still, cells that are not synthesizing elevated levels of heparanase-1 on their own, e.g. quiescent vascular endothelial cells, may capture and activate heparanase-1 precursor secreted by cells that overexpress heparanase-1, e.g. tumor cells, with potential “paracrine” effects on HS-dependent signaling pathways in these “recipient” cells. LRP levels and activity are known to be substantially decreased in many tumors (23Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Based on frequent loss of heterozygosity and functional mutations in tumors from cancer patients, and from receptor expression studies in tumor cell lines, it is proposed that the ∼300-kDa Man-6-P (Man-6-P·IGF-II) receptor represents an important tumor suppressor gene, possibly by mediating the endocytosis and degradation of IGF-II, in this way opposing its growth-promoting effects (27Ghosh P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Our findings could extend such a proposal whereby the loss of LRP and the Man-6-P·IGF-II receptor leads to the accumulation of (tumor) heparanase-1 in the extracellular space where it might be taken up and activated by (receptor-expressing) surrounding endothelial cells (promoting e.g. tumor angiogenesis). Moreover, it has been shown that the ∼65-kDa heparanase-1 precursor can enhance Akt and in some cases mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling by an unidentified receptor, stimulating endothelial cell migration and invasion (29Gingis-Velitski S. Zetser A. Flugelman M.Y. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23536-23541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The signaling role of the inactive precursor may be enhanced by the loss of LRP and Man-6-P receptors in tumor cells. A corollary of identifying LRP (and/or other RAP-sensitive receptors) as a binding receptor for the heparanase-1 precursor could be that it also functions as the receptor that mediates the signaling functions of the inactive precursor in endothelial cells. In summary, our studies identify HSPGs, LRP, possibly other RAP-sensitive receptors, and Man-6-P receptors as responsible for the capture or recapture of the heparanase-1 precursor and its delivery to the intracellular compartments in which it is activated. This may have major implications for the development of novel strategies for inhibiting heparanase-1 activation, inflammatory processes, and cancer progression.

https://openalex.org/W1976231288,"Lipoate-protein ligase A (LplA) catalyzes the formation of lipoyl-AMP from lipoate and ATP and then transfers the lipoyl moiety to a specific lysine residue on the acyltransferase subunit of α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes and on H-protein of the glycine cleavage system. The lypoyllysine arm plays a pivotal role in the complexes by shuttling the reaction intermediate and reducing equivalents between the active sites of the components of the complexes. We have determined the X-ray crystal structures of Escherichia coli LplA alone and in a complex with lipoic acid at 2.4 and 2.9 Å resolution, respectively. The structure of LplA consists of a large N-terminal domain and a small C-terminal domain. The structure identifies the substrate binding pocket at the interface between the two domains. Lipoic acid is bound in a hydrophobic cavity in the N-terminal domain through hydrophobic interactions and a weak hydrogen bond between carboxyl group of lipoic acid and the Ser-72 or Arg-140 residue of LplA. No large conformational change was observed in the main chain structure upon the binding of lipoic acid.

Lipoic acid is a prosthetic group of acyltransferase (E2) subunit of the pyruvate, α-ketoglutarate, and branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes and of H-protein of the glycine cleavage system (1Reed L.J. Hackert M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8971-8974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8501-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 3Fujiwara K.

It attaches to a specific lysine residue on the proteins via an amide linkage between the ϵ-amino group of the lysine residue and the carboxyl group of lipoic acid. In the reaction sequence of the complexes, the lypoyllysine arm shuttles the reaction intermediates and reducing equivalents between the active sites of the components of the complexes. The attachment of lipoic acid to the proteins occurs by two-step reactions in which a lipoyl-AMP intermediate is formed from lipoic acid and ATP, and pyrophosphate is released in the initial activation reaction (Reaction 1).Lipoate+ATP→lipoyl-AMP+PPiREACTION1REACTION 1 The lipoyl moiety of the intermediate is then transferred to apoproteins in the second transfer reaction, yielding the lipoylated protein and AMP (Reaction 2).Lipoyl-AMP+apoprotein→lipoylatedprotein+AMPREACTION2REACTION 2 Lipoate-protein ligase A (LplA) 2The abbreviations used are: LplA, lipoate-protein ligase A; Se-LplA, selenomethionine-substituted LplA; APMSF, (p-amidinophenyl) methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride; DTT, dithiothreitol; r.m.s., root mean square. from Escherichia coli catalyzes the above two reactions. LplA activates and transfers not only naturally occurring R-(+)-lipoate but also S-(−)-lipoate, lipoate analogues, and octanoate to the apoproteins, although S-lipoate and octanoate are used at a 44 and 16% rate of R-lipoate, respectively (5Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16091-16100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Green D.E. Morris T.W. Green J. Cronan Jr., J.E. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). LplA has a molecular mass of 37,795 Da, consisting of 337 amino acids excluding the initiating methionine residue, which is cleaved off during the biosynthesis (5Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16091-16100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Strains with lplA null mutations have severe defects in the incorporation of exogenously supplied lipoic acid and lipoic acid analogues into apoproteins (5Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16091-16100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In E. coli, there is another enzyme, LipB, responsible for the covalent attachment of lipoic acid. LipB transfers lipoic acid/octanoic acid endogenously synthesized on the acyl carrier protein by the function of LipA to the lipoate-dependent enzymes (7Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 8Jordan S.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1582-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). LipB consists of 213 amino acids, whose amino acid sequence shares only 12.7% identity with that of LplA (Fig. 1). On the other hand, the amino acid sequence of LplA shows 31 and 35% identity with those of human and bovine lipoyltransferase, the mammalian LplA homologues, respectively (Fig. 1). However, the mammalian lipoyltransferases have no ability to activate lipoate to lipoyl-AMP and catalyze only the second half-reaction (10Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31974-31978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 11Fujiwara K. Suzuki M. Okumachi Y. Okamura-Ikeda K. Fujiwara T. Takahashi E. Motokawa Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Strong homology in the N-terminal half region suggests that the region may be responsible for the second transfer reaction, whereas some residue(s) in the C-terminal region of the E. coli enzyme may be essential for the lipoate-activating reaction, which are lacking in the mammalian sequences (10Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31974-31978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To elucidate the structure-function relationship, we determined the crystal structure of LplA. We present here the structures of two forms of LplA: native and lipoate complex forms. LplA consists of two domains, the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains with a substrate binding pocket at the interface between these two domains. Lipoic acid is bound on the N-terminal domain side in the pocket through hydrophobic interactions. This is the first report on the crystal structure of the enzymes responsible for the lipoic acid metabolism. Construction of the Expression Vector Containing lplA Gene—DNA manipulations were accomplished by the standard techniques (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The gene encoding LplA was amplified by a PCR from the E. coli BL21(DE3) gene using a pair of oligonucleotides, 5′-AGGGTACCATATGTCCACATTACGCCTGCTCA-3′ (NdeI (underlined), Met (boldface letters), and nucleotides 86-104 (5Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16091-16100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and 5′-AGGGATCCTACCTTACAGCCCCCGCCAT-3′ (BamHI (underlined), Stop codon (boldface letters), and nucleotides 1096–1079) designed on the basis of the lplA sequence. The PCR product was inserted into the pET-3a expression vector (13Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). The construct pET-LPLA was verified by DNA sequencing and transformed into E. coli expression strain BL21(DE3)pLysS or B834(DE3)pLysS to obtain native LplA or selenomethionine-substituted LplA (Se-LplA), respectively. Cells were cultured in M9ZB (13Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) or Doublié and Carter medium supplemented with selenomethionine (30 mg/liter) (14Doublié S. Carter Jr., C.W. Ducruix A. Giege R. Crystallization of Nucleic Acids and Proteins. Oxford University Press, New York1992: 311-317Google Scholar) containing 25 μg/ml ampicillin, 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 25 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C for 22 h. The bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation. Purification of the Recombinant LplA—Both LplA and Se-LplA were purified to homogeneity by the following method. E. coli cells were suspended in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7. 5, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 40 μm (p-amidinophenyl) methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (APMSF), and 10 μg/ml leupeptin and lysed by sonication. The cell extract was obtained by centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 1 h and applied onto a hydroxylapatite column (3 × 6 cm) equilibrated with 3 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7. 4. LplA was eluted with 4 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7. 4, containing 0.5 mm DTT and 10 μm APMSF and further purified by a HiPrep 16/10 DEAE column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7. 5, containing 0.5 mm DTT and 10 μm APMSF. Proteins retained were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.2 m NaCl in the equilibration buffer. LplA fraction eluted at about 0. 1 m NaCl was concentrated with Centriplus YM-30 (Millipore Corp.) and applied onto a Superdex 200 pg 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was developed with 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm DTT, 0. 5 mm EDTA, 10 μm APMSF, 5% glycerol, 0.16 m NaCl. In the Superdex gel, the protein behaved as a monomer. Mutation of LplA—Mutations of S72A and R140A were introduced using an In-Fusion PCR Cloning kit (BD Biosciences Clontech). For the S72A mutation, PCRs were carried out employing pET-LPLA as a template and primer 1 (5′-AAGGAGATATACATATGTCCACATTACGC-3′ (pET-3a sequence (underlined) and then nucleotides 83-97 (5Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16091-16100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar))) and primer 2 (5′- GCCACCGGCACTGCGCCGCGCCAG-3′ (nucleotides 307-278; modified bases are shown in boldface letters)) to amplify the N-terminal half and primer 3 (5′- CGCAGTGCCGGTGGCGGCGCGGT-3′ (nucleotides 293-326)) and primer 4 (5′-GTTAGCAGCCGGATCCTAC-3′ (pET-3a sequence (underlined) and nucleotides 1099-1096)) to amplify the C-terminal half. For the R140A mutation, primer 1 and primer 5 (5′-GGTTTCGGCATAGGCCGAGCCTGAGA-3′ (nucleotides 511-486)) and primer 6 (5′-GCCTATGCCGAAACCAAAGATCGCGG-3′ (nucleotides 497-522)) and primer 4 were employed to amplify the N-terminal and C-terminal half, respectively. After the recombination reaction with pET-3a digested with NdeI and BamHI and the pair of the PCR products, the resultant plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. The mutant LplAs were expressed and purified up to the DEAE-Sepharose step as described above. The purified wild-type and mutant LplAs in the DEAE-Sepharose fractions were apparently homogeneous on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and used for the steady state kinetic analysis. Assay of LplA—The activity of LplA was determined in the reaction mixture of 50 μl containing 40 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7. 0, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0. 5 mm DTT, 3 μm E. coli apoH-protein as a lipoate acceptor, 30 μm R-(+)-lipoic acid, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, and appropriate amounts of wild-type or mutant LplA. After preincubation for 90 s, the reaction was started by the addition of ATP or lipoic acid and carried out for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by heating the mixture at 95 °C for 70 s. The amount of lipoylated H-protein in the mixture was determined by the glycine-CO2 exchange activity using E. coli P-protein as described previously (4Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20011-20016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apparent Km values of wild-type and mutant LplA for lipoic acid, ATP, and apoH-protein were determined by varying the concentration of one substrate with a constant concentration of the other two substrates. The constant concentrations are the same as those in the standard assay mixture described above. The concentrations of varied substrates were 1.25-80 μm for lipoic acid, 2.5-1000 μm for ATP, and 0.188 -4.5 μm for apoH-protein. R-(+)-lipoate was generously provided by ASTA-Medica (Frankfurt am Main, Germany). The recombinant E. coli apoH-protein was prepared as described for the preparation of holoH-protein except that E. coli cells were grown in the medium without an addition of lipoic acid (15Okamura-Ikeda K. Fujiwara K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17471-17477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Crystallization—Crystallization was carried out at 20 °C by the hanging drop-vapor diffusion method using a protein solution dialyzed against 5 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.5, and 3 mm DTT. Se-LplA was crystallized in a droplet containing a 1:1 ratio of protein solution at 3 mg/ml and reservoir solutions of 12.5-14.5% ethylene glycol and 21% glycerol. Crystals of Se-LplA·lipoate complex was grown with a modified protein solution at 5 mg/ml and a reservoir solution containing 3 mm R-(+)-lipoate. Data Collection—All X-ray data were collected at 100 K on the beamline BL44XU at SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan). The structure of Se-LplA was solved using Se-SAD methods (16Dauter Z. Dauter M. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 494-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Before data collection, wavelength was calibrated by fluorescence scan of the Se-LplA crystal, and a wavelength was selected for data collection corresponding to the white line (peak, λ = 0.9796 Å). Data were collected in a 180° sweep in 1° oscillation steps, using an imaging plate detector, and then integrated and scaled with the programs MOSFLM (17Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 1696-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and SCALA (18Evans P.R. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Data Collection and Processing: Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993: 114-122Google Scholar). The data collection for crystal of Se-LplA·lipoate complex was carried out with a wavelength of 0.9215 Å sweeping 90° in 1° oscillation steps. The crystal containing lipoate was very weak against radiation damage; therefore, two data sets had to be merged to get enough data for the structure determination. Each data set was indexed and integrated with DENZO and then scaled and merged with SCALEPACK (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The LplA crystals belong to space group C2221 with unit cell dimensions of a = 81.6 Å, b = 112.1 Å, and c = 289.2 Å for Se-LplA crystal used for structure determination. Structure Determination—All of the 15 expected selenium sites (for three monomers containing 5 Se-Met residues/asymmetric unit) were found using the heavy atom search program in CNS (20Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), and the initial phases were calculated with SHARP (21de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). 2.8 Å resolution maps calculated after density modification by SOLOMON (22Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) implemented in SHARP was used for determination of molecule mask and noncrystallographic symmetry operators for further density improvement. Solvent flattening, histogram mapping, and noncrystallographic symmetry averaging were applied for phase improvement using DM (23Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar), and the resulting map was used for model building. The structure of Se-LplA·lipoate was solved by the molecular replacement method with MOLREP (24Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4175) Google Scholar) in the CCP4 suite (25Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) using Se-LplA structure as a search model. Model Building and Refinement—Model building and refinement for all structures were performed using the programs O (26Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) and REF-MAC5 (27Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) in CCP4 suite (25Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar), respectively. Refinement for Se-LplA was monitored with the Rfree value calculated for a randomly selected 5% of reflections in the data set. The Rfree values of Se-LplA·lipoate were calculated with the reflections, which were used for calculation of Rfree values of Se-LplA. To build an Se-LplA structure, the quality of the initial experimental electron density map and known selenium sites allowed unambiguous tracing for the protein backbone and side chains. The protein model of Se-LplA was refined against the 43.6-2.4 Å resolution data set. The geometry library of lipoic acid was made using a monomer library sketcher in CCP4 suite (25Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The Ramachandran plot was defined by PROCHECK (28Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Structure Determination—Crystallization of E. coli LplA was mentioned about 10 years ago (6Green D.E. Morris T.W. Green J. Cronan Jr., J.E. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The structure had never been determined, presumably because of the difficulty to obtain crystals suitable for the structural analysis. Hexagonal shape crystals of Se-LplA (0. 06 × 0. 08 × 0. 1 mm) without substrate were obtained in 2 weeks by the hanging drop-vapor diffusion method, employing ethylene glycol as a precipitant. The space group of the crystal was determined to be C2221. The phase problem for LplA was solved by the SAD method, and the initial model could be built into the electron density. The final structure was refined using a 2.4 Å resolution data set, with cell dimensions of a = 82.0 Å, b = 112.8 Å, c = 289.4 Å. Results of the X-ray data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in TABLE ONE. Although cell dimensions were slightly changed among the crystals used, all crystals, the native and complex crystals, kept the same space group and similar cell dimension with a slight lack of isomorphism. There are three LplA molecules (MolA, MolB, and MolC) in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 2A). All residues (1-337) of the MolC could be assigned in the electron density; however, the density corresponding to residues 177-182 and 176-182 are missing in MolA and MolB, respectively. The final R factor for the reflection data used for refinement (working set) is 17.1%, and the Rfree value is 23.3%. Superpositions of Cα positions of MolA and MolB, MolA and MolC, and MolB and MolC give root mean square (r.m.s.) deviations of 0.57, 0.70, and 0.86 Å, respectively. Despite relatively large r.m.s. deviations among the crystallographically independent molecules, they keep almost identical structures except for some loop regions (Fig. 2B). MolA and MolC are related by the noncrystallographic 2-fold symmetry, and they form a dimer structure. The same relationship is also found between MolB and the adjacent MolB related by a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry (MolB′). The contact surface area of MolA and MolC is 4507 Å2 (13.6% of the sum of the surface area of the monomers), and that of MolB and MolB′ is 4196 Å2 (12.9% of the sum of surface area of the monomers) (29Tsodikov O.V. Record Jr., M.T. Sergeev Y.V. J. Comput. Chem. 2002; 23: 600-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Although the crystal structure of LplA shows dimer formation in a crystal, the gel filtration experiment shows that LplA is a monomer in solution. The dimer structure seems to be the result by the crystal packing.TABLE ONEData collection and refinement statisticsSe-LplASe-LplASe-LplA·lipoate complexData collectionSpace groupC2221C2221C2221Cell dimensions (Å)a81.682.083.2b112.1112.8111.6c289.2289.4289.6Wavelength (Å)0.97960.90000.9215Resolution range (Å)33.9-2.843.6-2.466.7-2.9(3.0-2.8)aThe numbers in parentheses represent statistics in the highest resolution shell.(2.5-2.4)(3.0-2.9)No. of unique reflections33,11052,72529,247Completeness (%)100 (99.9)99.4 (99.7)97.4 (99.0)I/σ (I)6.1 (1.0)18.0 (2.9)15.6 (3.8)Rmerge (%)bRmerge=∑∑j|〈I(h)〉-I(h)j|/∑∑j|〈I(h)〉, where 〈I(h)〉 is the mean intensity of symmetry-equivalent reflections.9.9 (66.6)5.9 (29.7)12.0 (42.1)Structure refinementResolution (Å)43.6-2.466.7-2.9No. of reflections49,80527,666RcR=∑||Fo|-|Fc||/∑|Fo|, where Fo and Fo are the observed and calculated structure factors for data used for refinement, respectively./RfreedRfree=∑||Fo|-|Fc||/∑|Fo| for 5% of the data not used at any stage of structural refinement.

Open table in a new tab Overall Structure of LplA Molecule—Fig. 2C shows a Cα trace of LplA (MolC). LplA consists of a large N-terminal domain (residues 1-244) and a small C-terminal domain (residues 253-337) connected by a single stretch of the polypeptide (residues 245-252). The N-terminal domain comprises two β-sheets, a large mixed β-sheet consisting of six strands (β1, β2, β6, β8, β9, and β10) and a small mixed β-sheet consisting of three strands (β3-β5), with seven α-helices (α1-α7) and a 310-helix (3101) surrounding the β-sheets. The C-terminal domain consists of three α-helices (α8-α10), two 310-helices (3102 and 3103), and a β-sheet comprising three strands (β12-β14). An open and solvent-exposed cleft is formed between the two domains. Fig. 1 shows the location of the secondary structure elements for the E. coli LplA, together with the amino acid sequence alignment of E. coli and putative Streptococcus pneumoniae LplA (30Tettelin H.

Amino acid residues well conserved among four proteins and between LplA and lipoyltransferase line inside of the cleft (on α1, β4 to β5, β9, and β10). These results suggest that the cleft is a substrate-binding pocket. The structure of LplA is similar to that of the putative lipoate-protein ligase from S. pneumoniae (Protein Data Bank accession code 1VQZ), which gives a Z-score of 29.8 for an alignment of 303/326 residue with an r.m.s. deviation of 3. 1 Å and 31% sequence identity by the DALI program (31Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar). The high structural similarity confirmed by superposition of the α-carbon traces of the putative protein and LplA suggests that the putative protein is a homologue of the E. coli lipoate-protein ligase A. The Lipoic Acid Binding Site—Because lipoic acid is a labile compound, LplA crystals complexed with R-(+)-lipoic acid were obtained by seeding small crystals of the Se-LplA·lipoate complex into a droplet to accelerate the crystallization. Crystals suitable for analysis were obtained within 3 days after setting the droplet. The lipoic acid-bound form was determined at 66.7-2.9 Å resolution. Weak but significant electron density corresponding to lipoic acid was found in MolA and MolB (Fig. 3, A and B). Positions of the lipoic acid in MolA and MolB are slightly different. This may be caused by weak interactions between LplA and lipoic acid or insufficient information from low resolution data. Lipoic acid is located in a hydrophobic core generated by Leu-17, Phe-24, Phe-147, Ala-138, and aliphatic parts of Glu-21 and Ser-72 side chains. Hydrophobic interactions are formed between these residues and the dithiolane ring and the hydrophobic tail of lipoic acid. Leu-17, Ser-72, and Ala-138 are well conserved among LplAs and lipoyltransferase (Fig. 1). The electron density for the carboxyl group is weak relative to that for the hydrophobic moiety. In MolA, the carboxyl group makes a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Ser-72, whereas in MolB, the carboxyl group hydrogen bonds to the side chain of Arg-140 (Fig. 3, C and D). Although the actual binding mode may change somewhat when higher resolution x-ray data are eventually obtained, this complex provides insights into lipoic acid binding to the LplA molecule. Because van der Waals interactions are neither strong nor specific, and a weak hydrogen bond occurs only at the carboxyl group, it may permit LplA to bind not only R-(+)-lipoic acid but also S-(−)-lipoic acid, lipoic acid analogues, and octanoic acid. The binding mode well explains why LplA activates these carboxylic acids and transfers them to apoproteins (6Green D.E. Morris T.W. Green J. Cronan Jr., J.E. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 7Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 32Brookfield D.E. Green J. Ali S.T. Machado R.S. Guest J.R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 295: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The reaction rates may be influenced by the slight differences in the van der Waals interactions between LplA and these substrates. Functional and Structural Similarities to Other Proteins—A systematic analysis using the DALI program (31Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) identified a number of proteins/domains with significant structural similarities to LplA. The closest of them other than the LplA homologue is BirA, biotin holoenzyme synthetase/bio repressor from E. coli (Protein Data Bank accession codes 1BIA and 1BIB) (33Wilson K.P. Shewchuk L.M. Brennan R.G. Otsuka A.J. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9257-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), which gives a Z-score of 9.4 for an alignment of 139/292 residues with an r.m.s. deviation of 3.5 Å and 12% sequence identity. BirA consists of three domains and functions as a repressor of the biotin biosynthetic operon and as an enzyme that catalyzes the activation and transfer of biotin to a specific lysine residue on the biotin-dependent carboxylases. The reaction mechanism is remarkably similar to that of LplA. The central domain contributes to the catalysis. Fig. 4 shows a superposition of LplA (residues 1-337) onto BirA (the central and C-terminal domains, residues 68-317) according to the rotation and translation matrices provided by DALI. Several α-helices (α1, α4, and α5) and β-strands (β1, β2, β6, β7, β9, and β10) of LplA are well superimposed on the corresponding secondary structure elements of BirA. In both enzymes, lipoic acid and biotin interact with β-strands in the N-terminal domain and the central domain, respectively, and the substrates are situated in the similar position in the respective enzymes. Functional and structural similarities of these enzymes suggest that evolutionarily they are closely related, although they share only 12% amino acid sequence identity. The absence of a DNA binding domain in the LplA structure may be related to the finding that LplA metabolizes lipoic acid that is exogenously supplied rather than that synthesized endogenously in E. coli (5Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16091-16100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Mechanistic Implication—Ser-72 and Arg-140 residues, respectively, were substituted by Ala to analyze the contribution of the residues to the lipoic acid binding (Fig. 3). Steady state kinetic studies were carried out by varying the concentration of one substrate and keeping the concentration of the other two substrates constant.

Consequently, Vmax(app) values were underestimated when the concentrations of ATP and lipoic acid were varied. Open table in a new tab Whereas the S72A mutation results in an about 2-fold increase in Km(app) for lipoic acid, Km(app) for ATP is greatly increased by the mutation, indicating the reduced binding affinity for ATP. This result suggests that the hydrogen bond between lipoic acid and Ser-72 may not be so critical to fix lipoic acid at the position determined by the crystal structural analysis. However, the fixation of the carboxyl group to Ser-72 is required for the initiation of the lipoate activation reaction with ATP, or ATP may interact directly with Ser-72. The R140A mutation results in reduced Vmax(app) values, although the values differ depending on the varied substrate because of the usage of the limited concentration of apoH-protein. Km(app) for lipoic acid is rather decreased. On the other hand, Km(app) for apoH-protein increases by 1 order of magnitude, indicating a reduction of the binding affinity for apoH-protein. In the protein lipoylation reaction, the presence of the Glu residue at the three residues N-terminal side from the Lys residue to be lipoylated in the lipoate acceptor protein is essential (34Quinn J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 279: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 35Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12932-12936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, Arg-140 in LplA may make a salt bridge with the Glu residue in the apoH-protein in the second transfer reaction (Reaction 2). These results of the kinetic analyses support the lipoic acid binding mode shown in Fig. 3 (i.e. lipoic acid is bound at the position by the hydrophobic interactions, and the weak hydrogen bond between the carboxyl group and the Ser-72 or the Arg-140 residue is enough to accommodate lipoic acid). We attempted to obtain a crystal of the LplA·ATP complex by soaking the native crystal with Mg-ATP and by co-crystallization in the presence of Mg-ATP. However, X-ray analysis of the crystals did not show electron density for ATP clear enough to determine the ATP binding site. The first step of the reaction catalyzed by LplA is thought to be the nucleophilic attack of the carboxyl oxygen of lipoic acid on the α-phosphorus atom of ATP followed by the release of the pyrophosphate and the formation of a lipoyl-AMP intermediate by analogy to the reaction catalyzed by histidyl-tRNA synthetase (36Åberg A. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Rasmussen B. Cusack S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3084-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The activated carbon atom of the lipoyl-AMP intermediate is then attacked by the non-protonated ϵ-amino group of the lysine residue of an apoprotein to be lipoylated, producing AMP and the lipoylated protein. To initiate the first reaction, ATP should be anchored near the lipoic acid in LplA, and especially the distance between the α-phosphorus atom of ATP and the carboxyl oxygen atom of lipoic acid should be less than 3 Å. LplA has a characteristic sequence motif RRSSGGG between positions 69 and 75, which is highly conserved among the proteins listed in Fig. 1. The motif is situated on the loop following the β4-strand (Fig. 2C) close to the bound lipoic acid. In the native LplA structure, the side chain of Arg-70 forms a hydrogen bond network with the main-chain carbonyl groups of Gly-73 and Gly-75 and the side chain of Ser-72, stabilizing the loop structure (Fig. 5). The motif can provide positive charges and a space large enough to accommodate ATP. Therefore, the motif is presumed to be involved in the binding of ATP or the adenylate moiety of the lipoyl-AMP intermediate. Indeed, the mutation of Ser-72 affects the binding affinity for ATP (TABLE TWO). An R72G point mutation in the human lipoyltransferase has been found in a hyperglycinemia patient, but no mutation has been found in the four proteins, P-, T-, L-, and H-protein, constituting the human glycine cleavage system. 3S. Kure, personal communication. The Arg-72 in the human lipoyltransferase corresponds to Arg-69 in E. coli LplA. The mutation may cause the reduction of the lipoylation level of H-protein of the glycine cleavage system, resulting in a decrease in the activity of the glycine cleavage system. The expression of the recombinant R72G mutant in E. coli failed presumably because of the instability of the mutant protein. 4K. Fujiwara, unpublished observation. These findings also suggest that the motif plays an important role for the binding of the substrate or the stabilization of the three-dimensional structure. Conclusions—The present study presents the LplA structure and its substrate binding site for the first time. LplA consists of a large N-terminal domain and a small C-terminal domain, comprising a substrate binding pocket at the interface of the two domains. Lipoic acid is bound to the N-terminal domain via hydrophobic interactions and a weak hydrogen bond to Ser-72 or Arg-140 in the pocket. The result well explains the reason why LplA utilizes lipoate analogues and octanoic acid in addition to the natural substrate, R-(+)-lipoate. The large solvent-exposed active site cleft is favorable to allow docking of the lipoate acceptor protein to initiate the second transfer reaction. In an effort to more fully define the active site geometry and to understand the reaction mechanism of LplA, co-crystallization studies of LplA with ATP and lipoyl-AMP are in progress. We thank Prof. Tomitake Tsukihara (Osaka University) for support of this work, Dr. Eiki Yamashita (Osaka University) for help in data collection at the SPring-8 BL44XU, and ASTA-Medica (Germany) for the generous gift of R-(+)-lipoate."
https://openalex.org/W2058569850,"Wrch-1 is a Rho family GTPase that shares strong sequence and functional similarity with Cdc42. Like Cdc42, Wrch-1 can promote anchorage-independent growth transformation. We determined that activated Wrch-1 also promoted anchorage-dependent growth transformation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Wrch-1 contains a distinct carboxyl-terminal extension not found in Cdc42, suggesting potential differences in subcellular location and function. Consistent with this, we found that Wrch-1 associated extensively with plasma membrane and endosomes, rather than with cytosol and perinuclear membranes like Cdc42. Like Cdc42, Wrch-1 terminates in a CAAX tetrapeptide (where C is cysteine, A is aliphatic amino acid, and X is any amino acid) motif (CCFV), suggesting that Wrch-1 may be prenylated similarly to Cdc42. Most surprisingly, unlike Cdc42, Wrch-1 did not incorporate isoprenoid moieties, and Wrch-1 membrane localization was not altered by inhibitors of protein prenylation. Instead, we showed that Wrch-1 is modified by the fatty acid palmitate, and pharmacologic inhibition of protein palmitoylation caused mislocalization of Wrch-1. Most interestingly, mutation of the second cysteine of the CCFV motif (CCFV > CSFV), but not the first, abrogated both Wrch-1 membrane localization and transformation. These results suggest that Wrch-1 membrane association, subcellular localization, and biological activity are mediated by a novel membrane-targeting mechanism distinct from that of Cdc42 and other isoprenylated Rho family GTPases.

The Rho family of Ras-related small GTPases is a functionally diverse group of proteins that are best known for their roles in regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization, cell polarity, cell adhesion, vesicular trafficking, transcriptional regulation, and cell cycle progression (1Raftopoulou M.

Missense mutations within the switch regions of Rho proteins lock them in a GTP-bound conformation and render these proteins GTPase-deficient and constitutively activated. Activated forms of some Rho family GTPases cause growth transformation of NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, and aberrant activity of both regulatory proteins and effectors of the Rho signaling pathways have been linked to human cancers (11Ridley A.J.

Wrch-1 (Wnt-regulated Cdc42 homolog-1) is a novel member of the Rho subfamily, whose transcription is up-regulated in Wnt-1 transformation of mouse mammary epithelial cells (15Tao W. Pennica D. Xu L. Kalejta R.F. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1796-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Like many other Rho family members, Wrch-1 activation is regulated by its nucleotide state, and a single missense mutation at residue 107 (analogous to Q61L activating mutation in Cdc42) rendered Wrch-1 more active in signaling (15Tao W. Pennica D. Xu L. Kalejta R.F. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1796-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of a constitutively active form of Wrch-1(107L) caused a Wnt1-like change in the cellular morphology of mammary epithelial cells, suggesting a contribution for Wrch-1 in Wnt transformation (15Tao W. Pennica D. Xu L. Kalejta R.F. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1796-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Additionally, like other Rho family proteins, Wrch-1 activation can promote growth transformation (16Shutes A. Berzat A.C. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 2052-2056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The correct subcellular localization and function of Ras and Rho family members are dictated by post-translational modification of the carboxyl-terminal hypervariable domain, including the last four amino acids known as the CAAX motif (17Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Michaelson D. Silletti J. Murphy G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M. Philips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The canonical CAAX motif consists of a cysteine residue, two aliphatic residues (AA), and at the last position any amino acid (X). The conserved cysteine residue serves as the site for post-translational modification by either farnesyltransferase (FTase) or geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I), which irreversibly attaches an isoprenoid moiety (19Casey P.J.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7959-7967PubMed Google Scholar), a second targeting signal immediately upstream of the CAAX motif is also required for proper membrane association and subcellular localization. Some small GTPases, such as H-Ras, N-Ras, and the Cdc42-related protein TC10, are covalently modified by addition of a palmitoyl fatty acid on cysteine residues, whereas others, such as K-Ras4B and Cdc42, contain several basic residues that serve as their second targeting signal (18Michaelson D.

Finally, additional carboxyl-terminal sequences provide further specificity in targeting Ras and Rho GTPases to distinct plasma membrane microdomains or to endomembrane compartments. Thus, functionally highly related Rho GTPase isoforms (e.g. RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC), by virtue of divergent carboxyl-terminal sequences and modifications, can exhibit strikingly different biological functions dependent on distinct subcellular locations (22Adamson P.

Like Cdc42, Wrch-1 induces actin reorganization and formation of filopodia and causes activation of the PAK and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase serine/threonine kinases (15Tao W. Pennica D. Xu L. Kalejta R.F. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1796-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, Wrch-1 contains amino-terminal sequences not found in Cdc42, and we and others recently showed that this amino-terminal extension serves as a negative modulator of Wrch-1 effector interaction (16Shutes A. Berzat A.C. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 2052-2056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 30Saras J. Wollberg P. Aspenstrom P. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 299: 356-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, Wrch-1 and Cdc42 differ considerably at their carboxyl termini, sharing only 25% sequence identity. Furthermore, Wrch-1 has an extended carboxyl terminus ending in an unusual CAAX sequence (CCFV) not characteristic of known substrates for farnesyl- and geranylgeranyltransferases (31Cox A.D. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2002; 2: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 32Fu H.W. Casey P.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1999; 54: 315-342PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in the present study we assessed the mechanism and role of the unique carboxyl terminus in regulation of Wrch-1 function. As with Cdc42, we found that Wrch-1 activation caused anchorage-dependent growth transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. However, although the carboxyl terminus was critical for Wrch-1 subcellular localization and transforming activity, Wrch-1 function was dependent not on modification by prenylation but on modification by palmitoylation. Thus, although Wrch-1 and Cdc42 share significant functional properties, they exhibit considerable divergence in lipid modifications and subcellular distribution and, consequently, may have divergent roles in cell physiology. Molecular Constructs—pcDNA3 expression constructs encoding wild type (WT) and GTPase-deficient (Q107L) human Wrch-1 was obtained from Dr. A. Levine (15Tao W. Pennica D. Xu L. Kalejta R.F. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1796-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). PCR-mediated DNA amplification was used to introduce 5′ and 3′ BamHI sites flanking Wrch-1(WT) for subcloning into various epitope-tagged expression vector constructs. To create other constitutively activated mutants of Wrch-1, a glutamate to leucine mutation was generated at residue 107 using the Quick-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Site-directed mutagenesis was also used to create the carboxyl-terminal CCFV motif mutants by changing cysteine residues at positions 255 and 256 to generate CCFV > SCFV (C255S), CCFV > CSFV (C256S), and CCFV > SSFV (C255S and C256S) point mutants in the activated Wrch-1(Q107L) background. To generate glutathione S-transferase (GST), green fluorescence protein (GFP), and hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged Wrch-1 proteins for prenylation, transformation, and localization assays, Wrch-1 coding regions were digested with BamHI and ligated into the BamHI site of pGEX-2T multiple cloning site, the 5′ BglII and 3′ BamHI sites of the pEGFP-C1 (multiple cloning site), and the BamHI site of pCGN-hygro, respectively (33Fiordalisi J.J. Johnson 2nd, R.L. Ulku A.S. Der C.J. Cox A.D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 3-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All sequences were verified by the Genome Analysis Facility at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Cell Culture and Transfections—NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Stable NIH cell lines were created by transfection of pCGN-wrch-1 constructs with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) per the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, cells were split into DMEM containing 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Applied Science) and maintained in antibiotic selection until colonies formed. Colonies (>50) were pooled for use in soft agar assays. Transformation Assays—For focus forming assays, NIH 3T3 cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish. The following day, cells were transiently cotransfected for 4 h with HA-tagged pCGN constructs encoding empty vector, activated Wrch-1(107L)-CCFV, -SCFV, -CSFV, or -SSFV carboxyl-terminal mutants along with pZIP-NeoSV(x)1 empty vector or pZIP-Raf22W (encoding an amino-terminal truncated and constitutively activated variant of human Raf-1), by calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (25Joyce P.L. Cox A.D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7959-7967PubMed Google Scholar). After 20-24 days, dishes were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 3:1 (v/v) methanol/acetic acid, and stained with 0.4% crystal violet solution in 20% ethanol. Non-Raf foci of transformed cells (see text) were counted, and the average number of foci found on duplicate sets of dishes was then calculated. For soft agar assays, NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing HA epitope-tagged pCGN constructs of either empty vector, activated Wrch-1(107L)-CCFV, -SCFV, -CSFV, or -SSFV were suspended in DMEM containing 10% calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.4% agar (BD Biosciences) at 5 × 104 cells per 35-mm dish. The single cell suspensions were layered on top of 0.6% agar in DMEM. Colonies that formed after 14-21 days were stained with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, and the average number of colonies on triplicate dishes was calculated. Live Cell Imaging—To analyze subcellular localization and lipid modifications of Wrch-1 proteins, NIH 3T3 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes. The following day, cells were placed in DMEM supplemented with either Me2SO vehicle, 10 μm FTI-2153, 10 μm GGTI-2166, 10 μm FTI-2153 + GGTI-2166, 20 μm compactin (Sigma), or 150 μm 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP, Sigma) immediately prior to transient transfection with FUGENE, of GFP-tagged pEGFP constructs containing Wrch-1-tail (13 amino acids), Wrch-1(Q107L)-CCFV, -SSFV, Cdc42-tail (20 amino acids), Cdc42(61L), H-Ras(61L), K-Ras4B(12V), or Rab5. FTI-2153 and GGTI-2166 were generous gifts from Andrew D. Hamilton (Yale University) and Saïd M. Sebti (H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, University of South Florida). After 24-48 h, live cell images were captured on either an epifluorescent Zeiss Axioskop or Zeiss 510 LSM confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) using MetaMorph imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downington, PA) or LSM 5 Image browser software (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). To visualize localization of GFP-tagged Wrch-1(Q107L) to early endosomes, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were transiently transfected with pEGFP-Wrch-1(Q107L). 24 h later, cells were serum-starved for 30 min with DMEM, rinsed in 1× PBS, and then treated with DMEM containing 30 μg/ml Texas Red-conjugated transferrin (Molecular Probes). After 10 min of incubation, cells were rinsed in 1× PBS, placed in DMEM, and analyzed for GFP-tagged Wrch-1(Q107L) localization using a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) bandpass filter and Texas Red-conjugated transferrin using a Texas Red (TRITC) bandpass filter. Colocalization of GFP-tagged Wrch-1(Q107L) and Texas Red-conjugated transferrin images was analyzed using MetaMorph imaging software. Immunofluorescence—NIH 3T3 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes. After 24 h, cells were transfected with HA-tagged pCGN-wrch-1(107L) constructs using FuGENE 6. After 24 h, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Cells were then incubated with anti-HA antibody (Covance) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes in 0.1% Triton X-100 in TBS, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min (Molecular Probes) and washed three times with 0.1% Triton X-100 in TBS. Coverslips were mounted onto glass microslides with Vectashield Hardset mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and analyzed on the fluorescent microscope as described above. Metabolic Labeling—NIH 3T3 cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish and transiently transfected with HA epitope-tagged pCGN constructs containing Wrch-1(107L) CCFV, -SCFV, -CSFV, -SSFV, H-Ras(61L), K-Ras(12V), or empty vector with FuGENE 6. After 48 h, cells were labeled for 4 h with 1 mCi/ml [3H]palmitate (American Radiochemical Inc.) in DMEM containing 5 mm sodium pyruvate, 4× nonessential amino acids, 1% glutamine, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 25 μg/ml cycloheximide, and 10% calf serum. Cells were then rinsed twice with TBS and lysed in Hi-SDS RIPA buffer (1 m Tris, pH 7.0, 5 m NaCl, 10% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 m Pefabloc, 0.05-0.10 trypsin inhibitory units/ml aprotinin). For immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated for 1 h with anti-HA antibody and then incubated for 30 min with protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunoprecipitates were washed, resuspended in nonreducing protein sample buffer (10% SDS, 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% sucrose, 0.01% bromphenol blue), resolved on SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were then sprayed with EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to film at -80 °C for 90 days. To detect total amount of immunoprecipitated protein available for labeling, membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk, and immunoprecipitated proteins were detected with primary mouse anti-HA antibody followed by anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were incubated in SuperSignal West Dura extended duration substrate (Pierce) and developed on film. Biotin (Btn)-BMCC Fatty Acyl Thioester Bond Labeling—To label Wrch-1 cysteine-palmitate thioester bonds, a modified version of a method described recently for detecting protein palmitoylation was used (34Drisdel R.C. Green W.N. BioTechniques. 2004; 36: 276-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, human embryonic kidney 293 cells transiently expressing GFP-tagged Wrch-1 proteins were lysed in BMCC lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.02% NaN3, and 2% Triton X-100) containing Complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science). Whole cell lysates were cleared, and protein concentrations were normalized using DC Lowry protein assay (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitation, protein lysates were pre-cleared with protein A/G-conjugated agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), incubated with anti-GFP antibody (Clontech) for 2 h, and then incubated for 1 h with protein A/G-conjugated beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates were washed, resuspended in 50 mmN-ethylmaleimide (Sigma) in BMCC lysis buffer to block free sulfhydryl groups, and incubated for 48 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed, treated for 1 h with 1 m hydroxylamine (Sigma) to hydrolyze any cysteine-palmitate thioester bonds, washed, and then treated with 1 μm Btn-BMCC (Pierce) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, for 2 h to label cleaved thioester bonds. Immunoprecipitates were washed, resuspended in nonreducing protein sample buffer (10% SDS, 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% sucrose, 0.01% bromphenol blue), resolved on SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were probed with streptavidin-HRP (Pierce) to detect incorporation of Btn-BMCC, incubated in SuperSignal West Dura extended duration substrate (Pierce), and developed on film. Purified Protein Preparation and in Vitro Prenylation Assay—Recombinant GST-tagged proteins were produced from Escherichia coli BL21 strain as described previously (16Shutes A. Berzat A.C. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 2052-2056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Protein induction was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. For isoprenylation of purified proteins, 5 μg of each purified protein was added to the prenylation reaction mixture containing 30 μg of bovine brain high speed supernatant and 1 μm [3H]farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) or [3H]geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) (8-10 Ci/mmol; American Radiochemical, Inc.). Reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Reaction was stopped with SDS protein sample buffer. Samples were boiled briefly, run on 4-20% SDS-PAGE, prepared for fluorography, and exposed to preflashed film for 4 days. Western Blot Analysis—NIH 3T3 cells transiently expressing GFP-tagged or HA-tagged Wrch-1 proteins were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, 20 nm β-glycerophosphate, 12 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.5 mm Pefabloc, and 0.1 mm sodium vanadate) or magnesium lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, containing Complete protease inhibitor tablet). Whole cell lysates were cleared, and protein concentration was determined using DC Lowry protein assay. Fifteen μg of protein lysates were prepared in sample buffer, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane. Membranes were then blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk and probed for HA-tagged Wrch-1 proteins using mouse anti-HA antibody, for β-actin as a loading control using mouse anti-β-actin (Sigma), for endogenous phosphorylated PAK using rabbit anti-phospho-PAK1 (Ser-144)/PAK2 (Ser-141), for total endogenous PAK using rabbit anti-PAK1/2/3, or for GFP-tagged proteins using mouse anti-GFP antibody (Clontech), followed by anti-mouse HRP-conjugated antibody or anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated antibody and SuperSignal West Dura extended duration substrate as above. The Carboxyl-terminal Nine Residues of Wrch-1 Promote a Subcellular Distribution Distinct from That Seen for Cdc42—As shown in Fig. 1A, the carboxyl termini of Wrch-1 and Cdc42 exhibit sequence differences that may result in different functional roles for Wrch-1. First, Wrch-1 terminates in an atypical CAAX motif. Second, Wrch-1 contains an additional 21 residues that have no counterpart in the Cdc42 carboxyl terminus. To determine the role of Wrch-1 carboxyl-terminal sequences in dictating Wrch-1 membrane association and subcellular location, and to compare these properties with those of Cdc42, we expressed GFP-tagged Wrch-1 and Cdc42 in NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts and performed live cell imaging analyses (Fig. 1B). Whereas GFP alone localized to the cytosol and prominently in the nucleus, both GFP-Cdc42 and GFP-Wrch-1 were excluded from the nucleus. Consistent with previous observations (18Michaelson D. Silletti J. Murphy G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M. Philips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), we detected Cdc42 localization strongly in the cytosol, with its predominant membrane staining in the perinuclear region. Wrch-1, however, distributed mainly to the plasma membrane and to internal membranes reminiscent of endosomes and polarized, perinuclear Golgi, demonstrating an only partially overlapping localization pattern with that of Cdc42 (Fig. 1B) (15Tao W. Pennica D. Xu L. Kalejta R.F. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1796-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 29Aspenstrom P. Fransson A. Saras J. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). We next wanted to determine which of the unique carboxyl-terminal sequences of Wrch-1 were sufficient to dictate its unique localization. Philips and colleagues (18Michaelson D. Silletti J. Murphy G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M. Philips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) demonstrated previously that the carboxyl-terminal CAAX- and hypervariable domain-containing 20 amino acids of Cdc42 and other Rho family GTPases were sufficient to determine their membrane targeting. As described previously, a GFP fusion protein terminating in the 20 carboxyl-terminal residues of Cdc42 exhibited the same subcellular distribution as authentic Cdc42 (data not shown) (18Michaelson D. Silletti J. Murphy G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M. Philips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 22Adamson P. Paterson H.F. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Despite the extended length of the Wrch-1 carboxyl terminus, we found that even fewer residues were sufficient for authentic Wrch-1 localization, as a GFP fusion protein terminating in the nine most carboxyl-terminal residues of Wrch-1 displayed the same plasma membrane and endosomal localization as authentic Wrch-1 (Fig. 1B). To confirm that the internal membrane structures were indeed endosomes, we compared dire"

https://openalex.org/W2095129820,"Granulin-epithelin precursor (GEP/progranulin) is an autocrine growth factor for ovarian cancer. We examined the production and function of GEP and report that: (1) GEP production is regulated by endothelin (ET-1), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and cAMP; (2) cAMP signals GEP production through exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC); (3) ET-1 and cAMP/EPAC induce GEP through ERK1/2; and (4) neutralization of GEP results in apoptosis. Exposure of HEY-A8 and OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cells to LPA and ET-1 yielded GEP production and secretion in a dose- and time-dependent fashion; neither stimulated significant concentrations of cAMP directly. Stimulation of cAMP production with pertussis and cholera toxin, or forskolin induced GEP in a PKA-independent fashion. EPAC, an intracellular cAMP receptor, is activated specifically by the cAMP analog, 8-CPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP (8-CPT); 8-CPT treatment stimulated GEP production and secretion. The MEK inhibitor, U0126, abrogated GEP production in response to ET-1 and 8-CPT, confirming involvement of MAPK. A partial inhibition of basal and stimulated GEP production was observed when cells were treated with a internal calcium chelator, BAPTA. Neutralizing anti-GEP antibody reversed basal as well as LPA, ET-1 and 8-CPT-induced ovarian cancer cell growth and induced apoptosis as demonstrated by caspase-3 and PARP cleavage, DNA fragmentation, and nuclear condensation. These results indicate that GEP is a growth and survival factor for ovarian cancer, induced by LPA and ET-1 and cAMP/EPAC through ERK1/2."
https://openalex.org/W2151492223,"ARK5, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-related protein kinase mediating Akt signals, is closely involved in tumor progression, and its stage-associated expression was observed in colorectal cancer. In this study, we found ARK5 expression in multiple myeloma cell lines expressing c-MAF and MAFB. In addition, gene expression profiling of 351 clinical specimens revealed ARK5 expression in primary myelomas expressing c-MAF and MAFB, suggesting that ARK5 may be a transcriptional target of the Large-MAF family. Sequence analysis of the ARK5 gene promoter revealed that it contains two putative MAF-recognition element (MARE) sequences. In support of this hypothesis, ARK5 was induced when an MAFB or c-MAF expression vector was introduced into non-ARK5-expressing colon cancer cells. Furthermore, ARK5 promoter activity was dramatically decreased by mutation or deletion of MARE sequences. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed an interaction between the Large-MAF family proteins and MARE sequences in the ARK5 promoter. Moreover, in ARK5 mRNA-expressing multiple myeloma lines, but not in ARK5-negative lines, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 increased invasion activity. IGF-1-induced invasion was reproduced when ARK5 was overexpressed in Burkitt's lymphoma and plasmacytoma lines. Based on results, we conclude that ARK5 is a transcriptional target of the Large-MAF family through MARE sequence and that ARK5 may in part mediate the aggressive phenotype associated with c-MAF- and MAFB-expressing myelomas."
https://openalex.org/W2043599959,"HAND proteins are tissue-restricted members of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor family that play critical roles in cell differentiation and organogenesis including placental, cardiovascular, and craniofacial development. Nevertheless, the molecular basis underlying the developmental action of HAND proteins remains undefined. Within the embryo, HAND1 is first detected in the developing heart where it becomes restricted to the atrial and left ventricular compartments, a pattern identical to that of the Nppa gene, which encodes atrial natriuretic factor, the major secretory product of the heart. We hereby report that the cardiac atrial natriuretic factor promoter is directly activated by HAND1, making it the first known HAND1 transcriptional target. The action of HAND1 does not require heterodimerization with class I basic helix-loop-helix factors or DNA binding through E-box elements. Instead, HAND1 is recruited to the promoter via physical interaction with MEF2 proteins. MEF2/HAND1 interaction results in synergistic activation of MEF2-dependent promoters, and MEF2 binding sites are sufficient to mediate this synergy. MEF2 binding to DNA is not enhanced in the presence of HAND1. Instead, cooperativity likely results from corecruitment of co-activators such as CREB-binding protein. The related HAND2 protein can also synergize with MEF2. Thus, HAND proteins act as cell-specific developmental co-activators of the MEF2 family of transcription factors. These findings identify a novel mechanism for HAND action in the heart and provide a general paradigm to understand the mechanism of HAND action in organogenesis.

During embryogenesis, the two HAND genes are initially co-expressed throughout the heart tube, but their expression pattern becomes complementary as the heart develops, with HAND1 marking the atria and left ventricle while HAND2 marks the right ventricle. Genetic studies have demonstrated clearly that both proteins are required for proper cardiac cell differentiation and heart morphogenesis (6Riley P. Anson-Cartwright L. Cross J.C. Nat.

Targeted inactivation of hand2 leads to embryonic lethality around embryonic day 10.5 because of cardiovascular defects that include right ventricular hypoplasia and vascular abnormalities (8Srivastava D.

Investig. 2000; 105: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the case of HAND1, analysis of its role in heart development was initially complicated by its requirement for proper placental development; mice lacking hand1 died at embryonic day 8–8.5 of placental and extraembryonic defects, tissues where HAND1 is abundantly expressed (6Riley P. Anson-Cartwright L. Cross J.C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 7Firulli A.B. McFadden D.G. Lin Q. Srivastava D. Olson E.N. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, tetraploid aggregation experiments showed that hand1 null embryonic stem cells could not contribute to the left ventricle, suggesting a cell autonomous requirement for HAND1 in this cardiac lineage (6Riley P. Anson-Cartwright L. Cross J.C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Gain-of-function studies in transgenic mice showed that misexpression of HAND1 in the whole ventricles altered expression of several genes including Nppa, the gene encoding atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), and Hand2 (12Togi K. Kawamoto T. Yamauchi R. Yoshida Y. Kita T. Tanaka M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4627-4635Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this study concluded that HAND1 is not a master regulator of the left ventricular myocyte lineage but rather that it acts cooperatively with other transcription factors to control dorso-ventral patterning. More recently, conditional ablation of hand1 in the heart provided support for these previous observations and revealed that absence of HAND1 in cardiac myocytes leads to structural cardiac defects, consistent with an essential role in cardiomyocyte differentiation (10McFadden D.G.

Targeted gain- and loss-of-function studies have also pointed to important roles for HAND proteins in placental (6Riley P. Anson-Cartwright L. Cross J.C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), vascular (11Yamagishi H. Olson E.N. Srivastava D. J. Clin.

Dyn. 2003; 226: 690-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) development. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the essential role of HAND proteins in organogenesis remain largely undefined.HAND1 was initially isolated by virtue of its ability to heterodimerize with the ubiquitous class I bHLH factors, E12/E47 (1Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 4Cserjesi P. Brown D. Lyons G.E. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 664-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, several independent studies showed that, unlike the MyoD/NeuroD subfamily (17Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar), HAND1-containing heterodimers do not bind canonical E-boxes (1Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 4Cserjesi P. Brown D. Lyons G.E. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 664-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 18Scott I.C. Anson-Cartwright L. Riley P. Reda D. Cross J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 530-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In vitro site selection revealed binding of HAND1/E47 to distinct DNA elements containing degenerate E-box motifs (1Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), but the relevance of these elements has yet to be confirmed in the natural context of HAND1 target genes. Interestingly, the ability of HAND1 to bind as a heterodimer and/or activate transcription from these sites may itself be regulated by other cofactors (18Scott I.C. Anson-Cartwright L. Riley P. Reda D. Cross J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 530-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). One such cofactor may be the LIM domain-containing FHL2 transcription factor, which was recently shown to interact with the bHLH domain of HAND1 and repress HAND1/E12dependent transcription (19Hill A.A. Riley P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9835-9847Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Finally, the ability of HAND1 to form homodimers versus heterodimers with E12 can also be regulated at the level of phosphorylation; two residues within helix 1 of the bHLH domain have been identified the phosphorylation status of which alters E-protein heterodimer formation and biologic activity in the limbs (20Firulli B.A. Howard M.J. McDaid J.R. McIlreavey L. Dionne K.M. Centonze V.E. Cserjesi P. Virshup D.M. Firulli A.B. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1225-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Other studies suggest that HAND1 may act essentially as a repressor by titrating class I bHLH factors in a manner reminiscent of that of the Id proteins (20Firulli B.A. Howard M.J. McDaid J.R. McIlreavey L. Dionne K.M. Centonze V.E. Cserjesi P. Virshup D.M. Firulli A.B. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1225-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); additionally, HAND1 was shown to contain transcriptional repressor domains capable of down-regulating GAL-E47-dependent transcription (1Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 21Knofler M. Meinhardt G. Bauer S. Loregger T. Vasicek R. Bloor D.J. Kimber S.J. Husslein P. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). At present, the question as to whether and how HAND1 acts as a transcriptional activator is not yet settled. Evidently, analysis of HAND1 action on target promoters would provide invaluable insight into its transcriptional pathways.In the case of the related HAND2 factor, two modes of action have been identified so far. One of them is E-box-dependent and involves DNA binding as a heterodimer with ubiquitous class 1 proteins (22Dai Y.S. Cserjesi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12604-12612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The other pathway does not depend on HAND2 binding to DNA; instead, HAND2 is recruited to the promoter through protein/protein interaction with GATA-4 (23Dai Y.S. Cserjesi P. Markham B.E. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24390-24398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Interestingly, interaction with GATA proteins may be a general property of class II bHLH factors as shown previously for SCL and GATA-1 in hematopoietic cells (24Wadman I.A. Osada H. Grutz G.G. Agulnick A.D. Westphal H. Forster A. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3145-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 25Cohen-Kaminsky S. Maouche-Chretien L. Vitelli L. Vinit M.A. Blanchard I. Yamamoto M. Peschle C. Romeo P.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5151-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Finally, HAND2 has been shown to interact with the homeodomain-containing Nkx2.5 protein and, in combination with E12, enhance its activation of the ANF promoter (26Thattaliyath B.D. Firulli B.A. Firulli A.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1335-1344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study, the modest ability of HAND2 to activate the ANF promoter could be enhanced by the addition of E12, although no interaction between HAND2/E12 and any of the ANF E-boxes could be detected. In fact, all E-boxes were dispensable for HAND2/E12 action, which apparently required the Nkx2.5 binding site. This was suggested to be relevant for ANF regulation in the right ventricular compartment (26Thattaliyath B.D. Firulli B.A. Firulli A.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1335-1344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).In addition to their overlapping expression pattern, two recent studies suggest that ANF may be a transcriptional target for HAND1. For example, the restricted pattern of HAND1 expression in heart atria and left ventricles is highly reminiscent of that of the Nppa gene, which encodes ANF, the major secretory product of the heart. Moreover, mice with cardiac-specific inactivated hand1 alleles have decreased ANF transcripts in the left ventricles, whereas in hand1/2 double mutant mice, ANF expression is completely abrogated (10McFadden D.G. Barbosa A.C. Richardson J.A. Schneider M.D. Srivastava D. Olson E.N. Development (Camb.). 2005; 132: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ectopic expression of HAND1 in the right ventricle was sufficient to induce transcription of the endogenous ANF gene (12Togi K. Kawamoto T. Yamauchi R. Yoshida Y. Kita T. Tanaka M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4627-4635Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the cardiac ANF promoter may be a transcriptional target for HAND1. Our results show that HAND1 is a transcriptional activator of ANF and identify for the first time a direct transcriptional target for HAND1. The studies also unravel a novel mechanism for HAND action, which involves direct physical association and cooperative interaction with MEF2 proteins. These findings have broad implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying HAND functions in cardiac and non-cardiac cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Cultures and Transfections—Neonatal cardiomyocytes were prepared from 4-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats and plated at a density of 250,000 cells/9.5-cm2 culture dish in six-well Primaria plates as described previously (27Charron F. Paradis P. Bronchain O. Nemer G. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4355-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). HeLa and NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were carried out using calcium phosphate as described previously (28Morin S. Charron F. Robitaille L. Nemer M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2046-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In general, the results reported are the mean of three to four experiments carried out in duplicate with two different DNA preparations.Plasmids—ANF-luciferase reporters containing various mutations and deletions of the rat ANF promoter as well as MEF2 and GATA-4 expression vectors have been described previously or were prepared using similar mutagenesis (28Morin S. Charron F. Robitaille L. Nemer M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2046-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 29Morin S. Paradis P. Aries A. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1036-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The endothelin-1 (ppET-1Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) luciferase reporter was described in Nemer and Nemer (30Nemer G. Nemer M. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 4045-4055PubMed Google Scholar). The HAND1 (eHAND) expression vectors were described previously (18Scott I.C. Anson-Cartwright L. Riley P. Reda D. Cross J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 530-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The myc-Hand2 expression vector was a kind gift of Dr. Robert Schwartz.Recombinant Protein Production and Pull-down Assays—HAND1 was bacterially produced as described previously (28Morin S. Charron F. Robitaille L. Nemer M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2046-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) with few modifications. After transformation of Escherichia coli (BL21, DE3) with GST fusion vectors pGST-HAND1 (pGEX-3X, Amersham Biosciences), individual colonies were picked and grown in 500 ml of LB to an optical density of 0.6. Isopropyl thiogalactopyranoside was then added at a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and bacterial cultures were grown at 37 °C for 2 h. The cultures were centrifuged, and the bacteria were resuspended in 20 ml of 1% Triton X-100 cold PBS and lysed by sonication. Purification was performed using 1 ml of 50% glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) in PBS, mixed at 4 °C with agitation for 2 h, and then centrifuged at 1500 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min to pellet the resin. The beads were washed three times in 50 ml of 1% Triton X-100 PBS, and the GST fusion proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE. Recombinant E47 and MEF2 proteins were produced in vitro using the TnT-coupled in vitro transcription translation system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). In vitro binding studies were performed as described previously (28Morin S. Charron F. Robitaille L. Nemer M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2046-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 3–5 μl of 35S-labeled MEF2 and E47 proteins were incubated with 300 ng of immobilized HAND1 fusion proteins in 500 μl of IpH buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.25% bovine serum albumin (BSA)) for 2 h at 4°C with agitation and then centrifuged for 2 min at 1500 rpm at 4 °C. The amount of total 35S-labeled proteins was kept constant (8 μl) in each binding reaction by adding 35S-labeled luciferase to complete. Beads were washed three times by vortexing in 500 μl of IpH buffer without BSA. The protein complexes were released after boiling in Laemmli buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Labeled proteins were visualized and quantified using a phosphorimaging screen and a STORM system (Amersham Biosciences).Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblots—Co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-HAND1 and hemagglutinin (HA)-MEF2A (pCGN-MEF2A) was carried out using nuclear extracts of 293T cells overexpressing the relevant proteins as described previously (28Morin S. Charron F. Robitaille L. Nemer M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2046-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation reactions were carried out on 50 μg of nuclear extracts using 1 μl of anti-HA (12CA5, Roche Diagnostics) antibody in 500 μl of binding buffer without BSA, and bound immunocomplexes were washed and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to a Hybond polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunoblotting.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out essentially as described previously (28Morin S. Charron F. Robitaille L. Nemer M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2046-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) using nuclear extracts from cells transfected with the indicated expression vectors. The probes for the MCK and ANF Mef2 sites were described previously (28Morin S. Charron F. Robitaille L. Nemer M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2046-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar).RESULTSHAND1 Is a Transcriptional Activator of ANF—To test whether ANF was a potential downstream target for HAND1, we carried out cotransfection studies using a luciferase reporter driven by the –700 ANF promoter. Previous studies have established that these promoter sequences are sufficient to recapitulate spatiotemporal regulation of the endogenous ANF gene in the heart. As shown in Fig. 1A, HAND1 activated transcription from the ANF promoter in HeLa cells in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was also observed in cardiomyocytes and in other non-cardiac cells (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the class I bHLH factors E47 and E12 also activated the ANF promoter (Fig. 1, A and B and data not shown). However, other bHLH proteins including MyoD, myogenin, Hey1, and Hey2 did not result in transcriptional activation of the promoter (Fig. 1A and data not shown). In fact, Hey 1 and 2 resulted in a dose-dependent repression of the ANF promoter especially in cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, the related HAND2 protein did not significantly activate the ANF promoter, a finding consistent with previous studies (23Dai Y.S. Cserjesi P. Markham B.E. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24390-24398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 26Thattaliyath B.D. Firulli B.A. Firulli A.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1335-1344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). These results indicate that the ANF promoter is responsive to HAND1 and provides a tool to elucidate the mechanisms of action of HAND1. Next, we carried out a limited structure-function study to determine the domains of HAND1 required for its transcriptional effect. Activation required the HLH domain of HAND1 but not its N terminus (Fig. 1C), a region associated previously with transcriptional repression (21Knofler M. Meinhardt G. Bauer S. Loregger T. Vasicek R. Bloor D.J. Kimber S.J. Husslein P. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In fact, removal of the N terminus produced a superactivator (Fig. 1C). Because E12/E47 also activated the promoter, it was important to determine whether the action of HAND1 on the ANF promoter involved interaction with class I bHLH proteins or heterodimerization with other factors. A tethered HAND1-HAND1 homodimer and a tethered HAND1-ITF2 heterodimer were tested in cotransfection studies. Both failed to activate the ANF promoter (Fig. 1C), suggesting that HAND1 activation of ANF may involve interaction with other transcription factors but likely not class I bHLH.HAND1 and E47 Target Distinct DNA Elements on ANF—To gain further insight into the mechanism of HAND1 action, we used mutational analysis of the ANF promoter to localize the HAND1 and E47-responsive regions. Removal of sequences between –640 and –500 bp reduced HAND1 activation by 5-fold (Fig. 2A) but had no effect on the E47 activation that was lost when sequences between –500 and –480 were deleted (Fig. 2B). This region harbors a conserved E-box, which is evolutionarily conserved in ANF genes from different species. Gel shift analysis confirmed that the ANF E-box at position –490 bp is a bona fide binding site for E47 as shown in direct binding and competition experiments (Fig. 2D). These results suggested that HAND1 and class I bHLH activate the ANF promoter via distinct pathways. Next, we undertook to map the HAND1 regulatory element(s). Previously, we showed that sequences between –640 and –500 contain a Mef2 element (28Morin S. Charron F. Robitaille L. Nemer M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2046-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, mutations of this element drastically reduced HAND1 activation (Fig. 2C), raising the possibility that HAND1 action involves functional cooperation with (endogenous) MEF2 proteins. We tested whether HAND1 affected MEF2 binding to its site using either the ANF (Fig. 2E) or MCK (data not shown) Mef2 probes. In repeated experiments using nuclear extracts expressing MEF2A alone or together with HAND1, we could not detect any increase in MEF2 binding in the presence of HAND1 (Fig. 2E). HAND1 alone did not bind to the A/T-rich Mef2 site or to an adjacent E-box (data not shown) suggesting that transcriptional activation of the ANF promoter by HAND1 does not involve direct binding of HAND1 to DNA. We also tested whether HAND1 activation could be due to interaction with endogenous GATA factors (GATA2 is abundantly expressed in HeLa cells (28Morin S. Charron F. Robitaille L. Nemer M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2046-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar)) because the related HAND2 protein was shown to interact with GATA-4 (23Dai Y.S. Cserjesi P. Markham B.E. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24390-24398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Mutation of the two high affinity GATA sites in the context of the native –700 bp promoter (27Charron F. Paradis P. Bronchain O. Nemer G. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4355-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) significantly reduced but did not abrogate HAND1 activation (Fig. 2C). In contrast, mutation of other regulatory elements, including the proximal SRE or the proximal NKE, had no effect on HAND1 activation (Fig. 2C and data not shown). Together, these results suggest that HAND1 is recruited to the ANF promoter via its interaction with GATA or MEF2 proteins.FIGURE 2Mapping HAND1 and E47 response elements. The cotransfections with various deletions and point mutations (mut) of the ANF promoter were carried out in NIH3T3 cells (A and B) or HeLa cells (C). The exact positions of the different binding sites are indicated in the text. M1, M2, and M3 are three different scanning mutants of the A/T-rich mef2 site. The experiments were carried out as in Fig. 1 using 1 μg of expression vector and 1 μg of reporter. The data are the means of two different experiments, each carried out in duplicate with different DNA preparations (S.D. <10%). Note how the response to HAND1 and E47 map to distinct elements. Mutations are in the following sites: NKE (mut-N), SRE (mut-S), GATA (mut-G), and MEF2 (mut-M). D, gel shift analysis confirms that the –490 ANF E-box is a binding site for E47. Nuclear extracts were prepared from L cells mock-transfected (L) or transfected with E47 expression vector (L+E47). ANF1 and ANF2 correspond to double-stranded oligonucleotides of 25 or 27 bp spanning the E-box site. ANF2 mut contains a mutation in the E-box consensus site. The TRE oligonucleotide corresponds to a neighboring E-box region that contains an AP-1 binding site. E, gel shift analysis on the ANF-Mef2 probe using nuclear extracts from 293T cells transfected with empty vector (Ctl) or with HA-MEF2A (MEF) in the presence or not of HAND1. Competitor DNA are used at 100×. Mef2 (MCK) and E-box probes were derived from the MCK promoter. The identity of the MEF2 complex is also confirmed using anti-HA antibody (αHA) blocking. All probes are described in Ref. 28Morin S. Charron F. Robitaille L. Nemer M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2046-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)HAND1 Is a MEF2 Cofactor—Next, we directly tested whether HAND1 and MEF2 interact functionally. This was done by cotransfecting the ANF-luc reporter with either MEF2A or HAND1 or both in NIH3T3 cells that have no detectable GATA activity. As shown in Fig. 3A, the presence of both HAND1 and MEF2A resulted in synergistic transcriptional activation. This synergy was also observed with MEF2C (Fig. 3E). Addition of the related HAND2 protein resulted in similar transcriptional cooperativity with MEF2 (Fig. 3A). The DNA binding domain of MEF2 (MEF2A DIVE) was sufficient to observe synergy (albeit to a lower extent) suggesting that MEF2 proteins acted to recruit HAND1 to target promoters. Consistent with that, HAND1/MEF2 synergy was also observed on a minimal ANF promoter driven by a multimerized Mef2 element (Fig. 3B). Given that we showed previously that MEF2 proteins could also be recruited to target promoters via GATA proteins (28Morin S. Charron F. Robitaille L. Nemer M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2046-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), we tested whether GATA-4 could also interact with a MEF2"
https://openalex.org/W2055213615,"Human organic anion transporter hOAT1 belongs to a superfamily of organic anion transporters, which play critical roles in the body disposition of clinically important drugs, including anti-human immunodeficiency virus therapeutics, anti-tumor drugs, antibiotics, anti-hypertensives, and anti-inflammatories. To gain insight into the regulation of hOAT1, detailed information on its structural assembly is essential. In the present study, we investigate the quaternary structure of hOAT1 using combined approaches of chemical cross-linking, gel filtration chromatography, co-immunoprecipitation, cell surface biotinylation, and metabolic labeling. Chemical cross-linking of intact membrane proteins from LLC-PK1 cells stably expressing hOAT1 converted quantitatively hOAT1 monomer to putative trimer and higher order of oligomer, indicating that hOAT1 is present in the membrane as multimeric complexes. When co-expressed in LLC-PK1 cells, FLAG-tagged hOAT1 co-immunoprecipitated with myc-tagged hOAT1. The hOAT1 oligomer was also detected in gel filtration chromatography of total membranes from hOAT1-expressing LLC-PK1 cells. Cell surface biotinylation with membrane-impermeable reagents and metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine followed by immunoprecipitation showed that the oligomeric hOAT1 did not contain any other proteins. Taken together, this is the first study demonstrating that hOAT1 exists in the plasma membrane as a homooligomer, possibly trimer, and higher order of oligomer."

Here we described the novel mechanism of VASP phosphorylation via cAMP-independent PKA activation. We showed that in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) α-thrombin induced phosphorylation of VASP. Specific inhibition of Gα13 protein by the RGS domain of a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, p115RhoGEF, inhibited thrombin-dependent phosphorylation of VASP. More importantly, Gα13-induced VASP phosphorylation was dependent on activation of RhoA and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase, MEKK1, leading to the stimulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. α-Thrombin-dependent VASP phosphorylation was inhibited by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of RhoA, whereas Gα13-dependent VASP phosphorylation was inhibited by a specific RhoA inhibitor botulinum toxin C3 and by a dominant negative mutant of MEKK1. We determined that Gα13-dependent VASP phosphorylation was also inhibited by specific PKA inhibitors, PKI and H-89. In addition, the expression of phosphorylation-deficient IκB and pretreatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 abolished Gα13- and α-thrombin-induced VASP phosphorylation. In summary, we have described a novel pathway of Gα13-induced VASP phosphorylation that involves activation of RhoA and MEKK1, phosphorylation and degradation of IκB, release of PKA catalytic subunit from the complex with IκB and NF-κB, and subsequent phosphorylation of VASP.

Walter U. J. Chromatogr. 1990; 521: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). VASP is the founding member of the Ena/VASP family of proteins, which consists of VASP, Drosophila Enabled (Ena), a mammalian Ena homolog Mena, and Ena-VASP-like protein EVL (2Haffner C. Jarchau T. Reinhard M. Hoppe J. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 3Gertler F.B. Comer A.R. Juang J.L. Ahern S.M. Clark M.J. Liebl E.C. Hoffmann F.M.

Cell. 1996; 87: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Similarly to other members of the Ena/VASP family of proteins, VASP contains the central proline-rich region flanked with Ena/VASP homology domains 1 and 2 (2Haffner C. Jarchau T. Reinhard M. Hoppe J. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). VASP is highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells, platelets, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts where it can be found in focal adhesions, along stress fibers, and in the areas of highly dynamic membrane activity, such as extending lamellipodia and filopodia (2Haffner C. Jarchau T. Reinhard M. Hoppe J. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 5Reinhard M. Halbrugge M. Scheer U. Wiegand C. Jockusch B.M. Walter U.

Sci. 2001; 26: 243-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). VASP plays an important role in physiological and pathophysiological responses of platelets and endothelial cells. Recent studies (7Massberg S. Gruener S. Konrad I. Garcia Arguinzonis M.I. Eigenthaler M. Hemler K. Kersting J. Schulz C. Mueller I. Besta F. Nieswandt B. Heinzmann U. Walter U. Gawaz M. Blood. 2004; 103: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) showed that VASP is an essential factor that negatively regulates platelet adhesion; in VASP knockout mice, platelet adhesion to the vessel wall was enhanced. Moreover, the loss of VASP increases platelet adhesion to the atherosclerotic endothelium and subendothelial matrix (7Massberg S. Gruener S. Konrad I. Garcia Arguinzonis M.I. Eigenthaler M. Hemler K. Kersting J. Schulz C. Mueller I. Besta F. Nieswandt B. Heinzmann U. Walter U. Gawaz M. Blood. 2004; 103: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). More importantly, phosphorylated VASP may participate in the endothelial barrier function and tight junction regulation. Phosphorylated VASP localizes to endothelial cell-cell junctions and may be co-immunoprecipitated with zonula occludens 1 after PKA activation (8Comerford K.M. Lawrence D.W. Synnestvedt K. Levi B.P. Colgan S.P. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 583-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). There is a growing body of evidence that VASP has complex effects on cytoskeletal organization and cell motility by regulating actin network geometry and thereby controlling the protrusive behavior of the cell (9Bear J.E. Loureiro J.J. Libova I. Fässler R. Wehland J. Gertler F.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). It was shown that VASP could induce polymerization of G-actin into F-actin bundles in in vitro assays. VASP was also shown to stabilize F-actin (10Laurent V. Loisel T.P. Harbeck B. Wehman A. Grobe L. Jockusch B.M. Wehland J. Gertler F.B. Carlier M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1245-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), to nucleate F-actin assembly (11Lambrechts A. Kwiatkowski A.V.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and to facilitate Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization (14Loisel T.P. Boujemaa R. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F.

Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). More importantly, the lamellipodial protrusion rate was shown to correlate positively with the intensity of green fluorescent protein-VASP at the leading edge (16Rottner K. Behrendt B. Small J.V. Wehland J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 321-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). All these molecular events are involved in the regulation of cell motility. VASP phosphorylation is a modulator for VASP-dependent regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. VASP can be phosphorylated at three sites (human VASP), serine 157, serine 239, and threonine 278 (corresponding to serine 153, serine 235, and threonine 274 in murine protein). Phosphorylation of serine 157 leads to a marked retardation in electrophoretic mobility and shift in apparent molecular mass from 46 to 50 kDa in SDS-PAGE (17Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKA is an important effector enzyme that is commonly activated by cAMP in response to cAMP-elevating agents. The established mechanism of PKA activation in response to various agonists involves the stimulatory G protein, Gs, which activates adenylyl cyclase resulting in a production of cAMP. Binding of cAMP to PKA regulatory subunits (PKAr) leads to the release and activation of catalytic PKA subunits (PKAc) (18Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). More importantly, our laboratory reported two novel cAMP-independent mechanisms of PKA activation. One study showed that vasoactive peptides endothelin-1 and angiotensin II activate PKA by inducing phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitor of κB (IκB), subsequently releasing PKAc from inhibition by IκB (19Dulin N.O.

A similar mechanism was reported for PKA activation upon lipopolysaccharide (20Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar) and thrombin stimulation (21Zieger M. Tausch S. Henklein P. Nowak G. Kaufmann R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 952-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, we reported that Gα13, upon interaction with protein kinase A-anchoring protein 110 (AKAP110), induces release of the PKAc from the AKAP110-PKAr complex, resulting in the PKA activation (22Niu J. Vaiskunaite R. Suzuki N. Kozasa T. Carr D.W. Dulin N. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1686-1690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Gα13 protein regulates multiple signaling pathways by transducing signals from the cell surface to activate diverse cellular responses. It regulates the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE1 (23Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Conklin B.R. Gilbert R.L. Hooley R. Bourne H.R. Barber D.L. J. Biol.

Mancino V. Revel J.P. Simon M.I. Science. 1997; 275: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). It also induces mitogenesis and neoplastic transformation (27Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A.

Commun. 1994; 201: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It was shown that important effectors in Gα13-mediated downstream signaling are RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42, members of a Rho family of small GTPases (25Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Faure M.P. Ahn N.G.

Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Rho is activated by Gα13 upon direct interaction of Gα13 with the Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, p115 RhoGEF (30Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G.

Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Recent studies from our laboratory showed two additional proteins directly interacting with Gα13. One is radixin, the member of ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) family of proteins, whose function is regulated by direct interaction with Gα13 (32Vaiskunaite R. Adarichev V. Furthmayr H. Kozasa T. Gudkov A. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26206-26212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The other is AKAP110, as described above (22Niu J.

Multiple receptors are reported to couple to Gα13, including the thrombin PAR-1 receptor (33Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Here we show that both thrombin and Gα13 can activate PKA and induce VASP phosphorylation in HUVECs and HEK-293 cells. Moreover, we described a novel mechanism of Gα13-induced cAMP-independent PKA activation and VASP phosphorylation that involves activation of RhoA and MEKK1. Activated RhoA and MEKK1, in turn, lead to phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκB, thus releasing PKAc from the complex with IκB and NF-κB. PKAc then phosphorylates VASP. As VASP proteins are multifunctional organizers of actin cytoskeleton (34Sechi A.S. Wehland J. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 1294-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), this study opens the possibility that thrombin and Gα13 are involved in subtle regulation of actin cytoskeleton. Reagents—Murine FLAG-tagged VASP cDNA was a gift from D. Browning (see Ref. 68Browning D.D. McShane M. Marty C. Ye R.D. J. Biol.

Myristoylated PKA inhibitor 14-22 amide (PKI), MG-132 proteasome inhibitor, and polyclonal anti-VASP antibody were purchased from Calbiochem. α-Thrombin was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories Inc. Anti-phospho-VASP (Ser-239) antibody was from Cell Signaling. Monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody, PKA inhibitor N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamidedihydrochloride (H-89), and eNOS inhibitor N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) were purchased from Sigma. Anti-Gα12, -Gα13, -HA, -RhoA, -ROCK-2, and -IκBα antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. RPMI 1640, glutamine, antibiotic-antimycotic, fetal bovine serum (FBS), Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), and Lipofectamine-2000 reagent were from Invitrogen. Endothelial growth medium (EGM-2) BulletKit and EBM-2 basal medium were purchased from Cambrex. Superfect was purchased from Qiagen. Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—The human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells (ATCC) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 units/ml streptomycin sulfate, 25 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 10% FBS. The human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured for up to 8 passages in EGM-2 BulletKit. Transient transfections of HEK-293 cells and HUVECs were performed using Lipofectamine-2000 and SuperFect, respectively, according to the protocols from the manufacturers. The HEK-293 cells were serum-starved in 0.2% FBS for 16 h. HUVECs were maintained in 1% serum 1–2 h before the experiment. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—RhoA-specific siRNA duplexes were purchased from Dharmacon. Nonsilencing control siRNA was from Qiagen. The siRNA transfection was performed using siRNA transfection reagent and siRNA transfection medium (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The final siRNA concentration was 60 nm. Immunoblotting—The HEK-293 cells were lysed 24–30 h after transfection. The quiescent HUVECs were lysed after stimulation with α-thrombin. Lysis buffer contained 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 μl/ml mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The insoluble material was removed from the lysates by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and cleared lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and analyzed by immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies. Phosphorylation-dependent electrophoretic mobility shift of FLAG-tagged VASP was detected by immunoblotting with the anti-FLAG antibody, whereas the shift of endogenous VASP was detected by immunoblotting with the anti-VASP antibody. The percentage of phosphorylated VASP was calculated by using densitometry analysis of VASP bands detected with anti-VASP antibody from scanned Western blot images using the ImageJ program. Luciferase Reporter Gene Assays—SRE-, κB-, and CREB-dependent gene expression was determined by the SRE.L reporting system, κB-luciferase reporting system, and CREB “PathDetect” trans-reporting system (Stratagene), respectively. Briefly, HEK-293 cells grown on 24-well plates at 90% confluency were transiently transfected with the following plasmids (per well): 50 ng of SRE.L, luciferase cDNA under the control of the serum-response factor-responsive element from the c-fos promoter (reporter plasmid), for assessment of SRE activation, 50 ng of κB-driven luciferase reporter plasmid, for assessment of NF-κB activation, or 75 ng of pFR-Luciferase (reporter plasmid) and 4 ng of pFA2-CREB (fusion trans-activator plasmid), for assessment of CREB activation, together with 50 ng of pCMV-β-gal (transfection efficiency control plasmid) and 100 ng of empty vector or plasmid as indicated. Cells were starved for 16 h, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with protein extraction reagent, and the cleared lysates were assayed for SRE-, κB-, and CREB-dependent expression of firefly luciferase and β-galactosidase activity using corresponding assay kits (Promega). Luciferase activities were measured with a Sirius luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems). Luciferase activity of each sample was normalized to β-galactosidase activity to correct for the differences in the transfection efficiency and expressed as the folds increase over the control. The data represent mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. The experiments were repeated two to three times with similar results. Kinase Assay—Kinase activity of Myc-tagged-LIMK1 was determined in the COS-7 cells grown on the 60-mm plates and transfected with Myc-tagged LIMK1. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed in the lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 40 mm Na4P2O7, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm Na3VO4, and 5 μl/ml mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The lysates were normalized for protein concentration, and Myc-tagged LIMK1 was immunoprecipitated from 100 μl of cell lysates by incubation with anti-Myc antibody at 4 °C for 2 h and protein A/G-agarose for 30 min. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer and two times in kinase buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm Na3VO4, and 5 μl/ml mammalian protease inhibitor mixture. Thereafter, the immunoprecipitate was incubated with ATP buffer containing 20 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, together with 4 μg of purified recombinant glutathione S-transferase-cofilin for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, followed by SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and PhosphorImager analysis. Cyclic AMP Assay—cAMP production was determined using the cAMP Biotrack enzyme immunoassay system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, cell lysates were incubated with antiserum, containing anti-cAMP antibody, followed by the incubation with cAMP-peroxidase conjugate, washing, and incubation with peroxidase substrate. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 m sulfuric acid, and the absorbance was determined at 450 nm. The results were determined from the standard curve and represent the mean ± S.D. from triplicate determinations. Immunostaining and Confocal Microscopy—HUVECs were transfected for 24 h where indicated and maintained in the EGM-2 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Two hours before the stimulation with α-thrombin, the cells were maintained in EBM-2 basal medium supplemented with 1% FBS. Thereafter, the cells were washed with HBSS, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Nonspecific binding was blocked with blocking solution containing 0.2% fish skin gelatin (Sigma) and 1% bovine serum albumin in HBSS followed by incubation with appropriate primary and secondary antibody dissolved in the blocking solution. The coverslips were then mounted using ProLong antifade kit (Molecular Probes). Images were taken by laser-scanning confocal microscopy on a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope equipped with 63× water-immersion objective and laser excitations at 488 and 543 nm. For quantitative analysis of the immunofluorescence data, HUVECs expressing FLAG-tagged VASP wild type and mutants were scored based on the localization of VASP in the cell. The percentage of the cells with VASP accumulated at the periphery was calculated from at least 200 FLAG-positive cells counted for each transfection. α-Thrombin Stimulation and Gα13Q226L Expression Induce VASP Phosphorylation and Phosphorylation-dependent Translocation—We tested the effect of thrombin stimulation on the phosphorylation of VASP by using HUVECs. We stimulated confluent HUVECs with 25 nm α-thrombin for different periods of time and subjected cleared cell extracts to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-VASP antibody. α-Thrombin induced prolonged phosphorylation of VASP (Fig. 1A) that lasted for at least 4 h after stimulation. Targeting Ena/VASP proteins to the membrane and focal adhesions is required for cell adhesion, motility, and formation of filopodia (35Han Y.H. Chung C.Y. Wessels D. Stephens S. Titus M.A. Soll D.R. Firtel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49877-49887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), indicating that VASP localization in the cell is critical for its function. Therefore, we next analyzed the distribution of VASP in the HUVECs stimulated with α-thrombin. We stimulated confluent and quiescent HUVECs with 25 nm α-thrombin for 5 min followed by fixation, permeabilization, and blocking of the nonspecific binding sites. Thereafter, VASP localization in the cells was detected by staining with polyclonal anti-VASP antibody, whereas F-actin was stained with phalloidin. Our studies showed that in HUVECs endogenous VASP is located at the tips of the actin fibers and along the actin fibers. After α-thrombin stimulation, the cells retracted, rounded up, and formed stress fibers. Most interestingly, in these cells VASP accumulated at the periphery of the cell (Fig. 1B). To test if VASP phosphorylation was required for the α-thrombin-induced translocation, we generated three FLAG-tagged VASP mutants where serine 153 and serine 235 were mutated into alanine, individually and jointly. We transfected HUVECs with FLAG-tagged wild type VASP (WT-VASP), VASP-S153A, VASP-S235A, or VASP-S153A/S235A (PD-VASP) and stimulated either with HBSS or 25 nm α-thrombin for 5 min and fixed them. The transfected cells were detected by anti-FLAG antibody and scored based on the localization of FLAG-tagged VASP in the cell. We calculated the percentage of cells with VASP accumulated at the periphery from at least 200 FLAG-positive cells counted for each transfection. The percent of the cells with VASP accumulated at the periphery of the cell was ∼52% in the case of WT-VASP, whereas it was 20, 23, and 14% for VASP-S153A, VASP-S235A, and PD-VASP (Fig. 1C), respectively. These results suggested that α-thrombin-induced phosphorylation of VASP on both serine 153 and serine 235 was required for VASP translocation. The representative images of localization of WT-VASP and PD-VASP in control and α-thrombin-stimulated cells are shown in Fig. 1D. Both FLAG-tagged WT- and PD-VASP had similar localization to that of endogenous VASP. However, after α-thrombin stimulation only WT-VASP translocated to the periphery of the cells, and localization of PD-VASP was not affected by thrombin. The thrombin receptor is coupled to members of the Gi, Gq, and G12,13 families of proteins (reviewed in Ref. 36Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar). To dissect G protein(s) that mediate α-thrombin-induced VASP phosphorylation, we used regulators of G protein signaling (RGS proteins). RGS proteins function as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) thus serving as negative regulators of G protein signaling (37Zhong H. Neubg R.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 837-845PubMed Google Scholar). RGS domain of Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor p115RhoGEF was shown to have GAP activity specifically for Gα12 and Gα13 (30Kozasa T.

RGS3 protein was shown to exhibits GAP activity for Gαi and Gαq (38Scheschonka A. Dessauer C.W. Sinnarajah S. Chidiac P. Shi C.S. Kehrl J.H. Mol.

We tested if transfection of HUVECs with RGS domain of p115RhoGEF, RGS3, or RGS10 could affect α-thrombin-induced VASP phosphorylation. Our results showed that expression of the RGS domain of p115RhoGEF but not RGS3 and RGS10 abolished VASP phosphorylation induced by α-thrombin (Fig. 2A), suggesting that it is likely that Gα12 and/or Gα13 are involved in this pathway. We next transiently transfected constitutively active mutants of Gα12 and Gα13 that lack GTPase activity, Gα12Q229L and Gα13Q226L, into HEK-293 cells along with FLAG-tagged VASP. Our result showed that Gα13Q226L expression induced VASP phosphorylation of both serine 153, as it was detected by electrophoretic mobility shift of VASP, and serine 235, as it was detected by phosphospecific antibody (Fig. 2B). Most interestingly, expression of Gα12Q229L did not induce VASP phosphorylation (Fig. 2B), indicating that this phenomenon is specific for Gα13. It is known that Gα12 regulates gene expression by activation of distinct transcriptional control elements such as the SRE"
https://openalex.org/W2084870597,"To understand the structural nature of signal sequence recognition by the preprotein translocase SecA, we have characterized the interactions of a signal peptide corresponding to a LamB signal sequence (modified to enhance aqueous solubility) with SecA by NMR methods. One-dimensional NMR studies showed that the signal peptide binds SecA with a moderately fast exchange rate (Kd ∼ 10–5 m). The line-broadening effects observed from one-dimensional and two-dimensional NMR spectra indicated that the binding mode does not equally immobilize all segments of this peptide. The positively charged arginine residues of the n-region and the hydrophobic residues of the h-region had less mobility than the polar residues of the c-region in the SecA-bound state, suggesting that this peptide has both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with the binding pocket of SecA. Transferred nuclear Overhauser experiments revealed that the h-region and part of the c-region of the signal peptide form an α-helical conformation upon binding to SecA. One side of the hydrophobic core of the helical h-region appeared to be more strongly bound in the binding pocket, whereas the extreme C terminus of the peptide was not intimately involved. These results argue that the positive charges at the n-region and the hydrophobic helical h-region are the selective features for recognition of signal sequences by SecA and that the signal peptide-binding site on SecA is not fully buried within its structure.

Every organism must specifically and efficiently translocate newly synthesized proteins to extracytoplasmic locations. The signal sequence, a 15–30-residue N-terminal extension on the mature protein, is generally required for the selective targeting of secretory and membrane proteins in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes (1Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Although there is no conserved primary sequence homology between signal sequences apart from the cleavage site for signal peptidase (2von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar), recognition still occurs with high fidelity. Although variable, signal sequences share similar properties: the net positively charged N-terminal n-region, the hydrophobic h-region, followed by a polar c-region (2von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar). That these regions function in a concerted manner is suggested by the observation that mutations in one region can be restored by changes in another (3Gennity J. Goldstein J. Inouye M. J. Bioenerg.

The interactions between signal sequences and their receptors appear to be selective for these physical characteristics rather than the primary amino acid sequence.SecA, the unique preprotein translocating ATPase in bacterial cells, is a dimer of 100 kDa subunits that recognizes both the signal sequence and parts of the mature region of the preprotein/SecB complex (7Lill R.

Utilizing energy from ATP binding and hydrolysis, SecA dramatically changes its conformation to insert and retract from the SecYEG channel and translocate the preprotein stepwise across the membrane (10Economou A.

Genetic and biochemical studies have shown that mutations or deletions in the signal sequence significantly reduce or eliminate its translocation activity (5Izard J.W. Rusch S.L. Kendall D.A. J.

Cell. 1990; 61: 833-842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), suggest that SecA, SecY, SecE, and SecG have direct interaction with signal sequences. However, recent studies raise the possibility that prl mutations may be due to a variety of factors (19Veenendaal A.K. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Therefore, signal sequence recognition by SecA is a key entry point to the protein targeting and translocation pathway in bacteria.Despite considerable research directed at SecA function, the basis for its recognition of signal sequences is not clear. Previous studies of synthetic signal peptides suggested that the capacity to take up an α-helical conformation is important for their function (17Stader J. Benson S.A. Silhavy T.J. J. Biol.

The N-terminal region resembles superfamily II DEAD helicases with two nucleotide-binding folds in intimate contact forming a regulated binding site for nucleotide at their interface. The first nucleotide-binding fold has an insertion (from residues 220 to 373 in Escherichia coli SecA), which has been proposed to bind the signal sequence based on cross-linking (25Kimura E.

Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1342-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The helicase domain is followed by a long α-helical scaffold and then by a C-terminal domain that has been shown biochemically to interact with the membrane (43Ulbrandt N.D. London E. Oliver D.B. J.

Considerable evidence suggests that SecA undergoes a large conformational change upon interaction with SecY and the surrounding membrane lipids (8Vrontou E. Economou A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). There are no direct data regarding the mode of recognition of the signal sequence by SecA, although deletional analysis and assessment of the ability of various fragments to bind signal sequences, as well as inspection of crystal structures, have led to various models (8Vrontou E. Economou A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 38Osborne A.R. Clemons Jr., W.M. Rapoport T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Understanding the mode of recognition of signal peptides by SecA and assessment of the likelihood of any of the proposed models would be greatly helped by observation of the SecA-bound conformation of a signal peptide.

Jordan R. McMacken R. Gierasch L.M. Nature. 1992; 355: 455-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 46Wang Z. Feng H.-P. Landry S.J. Maxwell J. Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12537-12546Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We report the results of trNOE experiments on the water-soluble modified LamB signal peptide (KRR-LamB) (36Wang Z.L. Jones J.D. Rizo J. Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13991-13999Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) upon interaction with E. coli SecA. We find that the signal peptide binds SecA with a moderately fast exchange rate. The signal peptide forms an α-helical conformation upon binding to SecA. The positively charged arginine residues of the n-region and the hydrophobic residues of the h-region are more immobilized than the polar residues of the c-region in the bound state. These results suggest that electrostatic interaction at the n-region and hydrophobic interactions of the α-helical h-region are important for signal sequence recognition by SecA.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—Unless specifically mentioned, standard laboratory reagents were purchased from Sigma or VWR Scientific.SecA Preparation—SecA was purified from overexpressing E. coli strains BL21.19 (pT7-SecA2) kindly provided by Don Oliver (Wesleyan University, Middletown, CT), and proteins were purified as described previously (23Triplett T.L.

ATPase activity of purified SecA was verified to be comparable with literature values (23Triplett T.L. Sgrignoli A.R. Gao F. Yang Y. Tai P.C. Gierasch L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19648-19655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Protein samples were concentrated using Centricon-30 or -50 (Millipore) to achieve millimolar concentration and then co-mixed with the peptides to the desired concentration for NMR. Protein concentrations were measured via the Bradford assay.Signal Peptide Synthesis and Purification—The KRR-LamB signal peptide (+H3N-MMITLRKRRKLPLAVAVAAGVMSAQAMA-CONH2) and a deletion mutant that is defective for export, the Δ78 variant (37Emr S.D.

Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13991-13999Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Signal peptide concentrations were determined via the Bradford assay, which was calibrated by quantitative amino acid analysis.NMR Studies—Samples for NMR spectrometry consisted of 0.8–1.0 mm peptide and 0–20 μm SecA in 5 mm KCl, 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.3–7.0), and 10% D2O with 0.02% azide. Spectra were obtained using a Bruker Avance 600 NMR spectrometer. 1H chemical shifts were referenced with respect to the methyl protons of 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionate (0 parts/million). Data were processed within the FELIX 2000 program (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) running on a Silicon Graphics Indigo workstation (Mountain View, CA). For all experiments, the spectral widths were 6000 Hz. All two-dimensional experiments were recorded using States-time proportional phase incrementation (47Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. 1st. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 95-243Google Scholar) with 16–64 scans. For the total correlated spectroscopy (TOCSY) experiment, the mixing time was 70 ms. Nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra were obtained using mixing times of 75–300 ms. The H2O resonance was suppressed by 3–9–19 WATERGATE field-gradient pulses (47Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. 1st. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 95-243Google Scholar). Two-dimensional spectra were composed of 2048 or 4096 complex points in the F2 dimension and 1024 real points in the F1 dimension with 16–64 scans per t1 increment. All free induction decays were zero-filled, apodized with Gaussian or sine-bell window functions, and Fourier-transformed, yielding matrices of 2048 × 2048 or 2048 × 4096 real points for TOCSY or NOESY spectra.RESULTSConformation and Sequential Assignment of the Free KRR-LamB Signal Peptide—KRR-modified LamB signal peptides free in solution have been shown to adopt largely random structures at room temperature, judged by circular dichroism spectroscopy (Ref. 36Wang Z.L. Jones J.D. Rizo J. Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13991-13999Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar and data not shown). They self-associate at high concentration (>millimolar), which increases their helical content (Ref. 36Wang Z.L. Jones J.D. Rizo J. Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13991-13999Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar and data not shown). Due to the presence of several identical residues in tandem in the sequence, the tumbling rate of the signal peptide, and the lack of a preferred conformation at low concentration in aqueous solution, spectra of the free signal peptide had severe spectral overlap and relatively few NOEs, making sequential assignment difficult. The assignment process was facilitated by comparison to previous assignments of a highly similar peptide (36Wang Z.L. Jones J.D. Rizo J. Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13991-13999Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and by adjustment of solution conditions (lowering pH and/or temperature or adding a small amount (2.5 mol%) of trifluoroethanol, which promotes formation of a helical conformation and disperses the proton resonances). Sequential assignments of the KRR-LamB signal peptide under different conditions were successfully completed using standard methods (48Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids.

NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley and Sons, New York1986: 27-175Google Scholar). If the peptide resonances broaden as the protein concentration increases, no new resonances appear, and no significant chemical shifts occur, the system can be identified as undergoing moderately fast exchange (49Lian L.Y. Barsukov I.L. Sutcliffe M.J. Sze K.H. Roberts G.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).The one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra in Fig. 1A show that the KRR-LamB signal peptide was bound by SecA with a moderately fast exchange rate, as indicated by line-broadening to a degree that was dependent on the SecA concentration. The internal standard (3-(trimethylsilyl)propionate) was not affected by the addition of SecA, indicating that the observed broadening was not a viscosity effect. Some peaks showed weaker broadening, specifically Lys-7/10 ϵH and Gln-25 γH. This suggests that the binding mode does not equally immobilize all segments of the peptide. Lys-7/10 ϵH and Gln-25 γH were weakly broadened (Δν ½ = 3.5 and 1.7 Hz, respectively) after the addition of 20 μm SecA. In contrast, under the same conditions, Arg-6/8/9 δH were strongly broadened (Δν ½ = 12.6 Hz). These large differences suggest that one or more of the Arg-6, -8, and -9 side chains are more immobilized, most likely via direct contact with SecA. In contrast, Lys-7, Lys-10, and Gln-25 side chains are less immobilized and may not have direct contact with the protein when the peptide binds to SecA.The one-dimensional 1H spectrum of the non-functional KRR-LamB Δ78 signal peptide, which has four residues deleted from the h-region (37Emr S.D. Silhavy T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4599-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), is not affected by the addition of SecA (data not shown). This indicates that there is no interaction between the non-functional signal peptide KRR-LamB Δ78 and SecA and suggests that the hydrophobic residues of the h-region are essential for signal sequence recognition by SecA.To understand the detailed binding mode between the KRR-LamB signal peptide and SecA, we examined TOCSY spectra in both the absence and in the presence of 15 μm SecA protein (Fig. 1, B and C). The line width and intensity changes of the cross-peaks in the backbone amide proton and α proton (NH-αH) region of the TOCSY spectrum reported the loss of mobility of the backbone of the corresponding residue, whereas that of the amide proton and side chain proton (NH-βγδH) region were also influenced by the mobility of the side chain of the corresponding residue. Although most of the cross-peaks experienced significant broadening upon the addition of SecA (Fig. 1, B and C), judged by increased line width and decreased intensity of the cross-peaks, resonances from the c-region residues (Ala-26 NH-αH, Met-27 NH-αH, Ala-28 NH-αH, and Ala-28 NH-βH) were less affected (∼20% loss of intensity in contrast to intensity decreases of ∼40–50% for the other cross-peaks). The intensity changes of the cross-peaks in the NH-βγδH regions further revealed that the side chains of the residues in the n-region (except lysine) and the hydrophobic residues of the h-region were most directly involved in the binding to SecA. Their intensities decreased significantly, between 30 and 55%, whereas the residues of the c-region only showed 20–30% loss of signal intensity. It is noteworthy that the NH-γH cross-peaks of Lys-7 and Lys-10 only had ∼20 and 15% signal intensity changes, respectively, whereas the NH-γH cross-peaks of the adjacent positively charged residue Arg-8 showed relatively high percentage decreases (∼50%) in signal intensity (Fig. 1B). This was similar to the results of one-dimensional proton spectra (Lys ϵH versus Arg δH), although the corresponding NH-αH cross-peaks in the TOCSY showed similar intensity changes. One would expect that the adjacent residues in a peptide sequence would experience similar mobility changes during the binding event; however, the largely different immobilization effects between the side chain protons of the positively charged lysine and that of arginine residues in the n-region of the KRR-LamB peptide strongly suggest that the arginine residues have electrostatic interactions with the binding pocket of SecA, whereas lysine residues do not. This result may have arisen because of the sidedness of the signal sequence interaction with SecA or alternatively because SecA showed a preference for arginine over lysine residues.The stack plots of the major α proton and side chain proton region (Fig. 1C) also showed similar results. The cross-peaks of Ile-3 αH/γδH, Leu-13 αH/δH, Thr-4 βH/γH, Val-15 and -17 αH/γH, and Pro-12 αH/βγH all were significantly broadened upon the addition of SecA. On the other hand, the cross-peaks of Lys-7 and -10 αH/γH, Ala-26 and -28 αH/βH, and Val-21 αH/γH showed only slight broadening effects. The comparison suggests that the side chain residues of the n- and h-regions (except the lysine) are immobilized more by SecA than those in the c-region, indicating these two regions bind more tightly with SecA than the c-region of the signal peptide.Conformation of the SecA-bound KRR-LamB Signal Peptide Based on trNOEs—In the unbound form, the KRR-LamB signal peptide is characterized by a short correlation time (τc ∼ 1 ns), which is near the inverse of the Larmor procession frequency of protons in the NMR spectrometer; therefore, the magnitudes of NOEs are close to zero (Fig. 2A). When KRR-LamB signal peptide is bound to SecA (τc ∼ 100 ns), magnetization transfer between different NMR-active nuclei within the signal peptide becomes more efficient because of its slower tumbling. Under conditions of a moderately fast exchange rate, where the dissociation rate constant koff is faster than the cross-relaxation rate, we can then observe in the free state of the peptide the trNOEs that reflect distance relationships of the bound state (50Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Mag. Res. 1982; 48: 402-417Google Scholar, 51Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Mag. Res. 1983; 53: 423-442Google Scholar, 52Campbell A.P. Sykes B.D. Ann. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

The intensities of these inter-residue NOEs increased as the concentration of SecA increased, indicating that the binding between the signal peptide and SecA protein accounts for the trNOEs (data not shown).FIGURE 2trNOEs in two-dimensional NMR NOESY spectra of the signal peptide upon addition of SecA and a summary of observed structurally diagnostic inter-residue trNOEs.

We have reported previously that DNA oligonucleotides substantially homologous to the telomere 3′-overhang (T-oligos) induce DNA repair capacity and multiple other cancer prevention responses, in part through up-regulation and activation of p53. To determine whether T-oligos affect COX-2 expression, human newborn keratinocytes and fibroblasts were pretreated with T-oligos or diluent alone for 24 h, UV-irradiated, and processed for Western blotting. In both cell types, T-oligos transcriptionally down-regulated base-line and UV light-induced COX-2 expression, coincident with p53 activation. In fibroblasts with wild type versus dominant negative p53 (p53WT versus p53DN), T-oligos decreased constitutive expression of a COX-2 reporter plasmid by >50%. We then examined NFκB, a known positive regulator of COX-2 transcription. In p53WT but not in p53DN fibroblasts and in human keratinocytes, T-oligos decreased readout of an NFκB promoter-driven reporter plasmid and decreased NFκB binding to DNA. After T-oligo treatment and subsequent UV irradiation, binding of the transcriptional co-activator protein p300 to NFκB was decreased, whereas binding of p300 to p53 was increased. Human skin explants provided with T-oligos had markedly decreased COX-2 immunostaining both at base-line and post-UV light, coincident with increased p53 immunostaining. We conclude that T-oligos transcriptionally down-regulate COX-2 expression in human skin via activation and up-regulation of p53, at least in part by inhibiting NFκB transcriptional activation.

Furthermore, specific inhibitors of Cox-2 such as celecoxib have been shown not only to decrease tumorigenesis and increase tumor latency in hairless mice models (28Orengo I.F. Gerguis J. Phillips R.

Aldaz C.M. Lubet R.A. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, Cox-2-overexpressing transgenic mice have shown dramatic increase in predisposition to tumor development in tumor promotion studies (30Muller-Decker K. Neufang G. Berger I. Neumann M.

Known inhibitors of COX-2 include estrogens, antioxidants, and p53 (31Ahmed S. Rahman A. Hasnain A. Lalonde M. Goldberg V.M. Haqqi T.M. Free Radic. Biol.

The presence of active p53 in particular has been shown to decrease both the mRNA and protein levels of Cox-2 in mouse embryo fibroblasts (33Subbaramaiah K. Altorki N. Chung W.J. Mestre J.R. Sampat A. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10911-10915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In a study of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), tumors with mutated p53 showed higher COX-2 protein levels than tumors expressing wild type (WT) p53 (34Gallo O. Schiavone N. Papucci L.

Evidence thus suggests that activating p53 and thereby reducing COX-2 expression in the absence of DNA damage might decrease photocarcinogenesis and inhibit growth of established tumors.In mammalian cells, telomeres are tandem repeats of a short DNA sequence, 5′-TTAGGG-′ and its complement that cap chromosome ends and form a large loop structure (35Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). The loop is held closed by an ∼100–400-base single-stranded 3′-overhang that inserts into the proximal double-stranded telomere and is secured by binding proteins, particularly telomere repeat binding factor (TRF2) (36Stansel R.M. de Lange T. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5532-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Disruption of this loop structure by sequestration of the binding protein with a dominant negative construct (TRF2DN) leads to exposure of the 3′-overhang sequence (repeats of TTAGGG), digestion of the overhang, and signaling through ATM and p53 that induces DNA damage responses (37Karlseder J. Broccoli D. Dai Y. Hardy S. de Lange T. Science. 1999; 283: 1321-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). We have found that providing cultured cells with DNA oligonucleotides substantially homologous to the telomere sequence, which we term T-oligos, mimics telomere loop disruption, leading to ATM/p53 signaling (38Eller M.S.

These responses are shown to occur at least in part through up-regulation and activation of p53, leading to transcriptional repression of COX-2 promoter activity. We propose that in addition to the previously reported protective DNA damage responses, treatment with T-oligos may also decrease the cutaneous inflammatory response through inhibition of COX-2 expression, a possible additional means of reducing photocarcinogenesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Primary human neonatal fibroblast and keratinocytes cultures were established as described (49Eller M.S.

Oligonucleotides (pTT and p9-mer) were synthesized with phosphodiester linkage by Midland Certified Reagent (Midland, TX) and diluted in H2O to form a 2 mm stock. This stock solution was then diluted in the appropriate culture medium to 100 or 40 μm, respectively, and added to culture dishes for use in experiments. Cells and skin explants were provided T-oligos only once at time 0 and then harvested at intervals, according to the design of the specific experiment. All experiments were conducted using both pTT and p9-mer and gave identical results with either T-oligo.UVB Irradiation—After 48 h of incubation in medium containing pTT, p9-mer, or diluent alone, cells or skin explants were placed in phosphate-buffered saline and irradiated through the plastic culture dish cover by using a solar simulator (Spectral Energy Corp., Westwood, NJ). The 1-kilowatt xenon arc lamp (XMN-1000-21; Optical Radiation Corp., Azuza, CA) irradiance was adjusted to 5 × 10-5 watts/cm2, and dishes were exposed to 15 mJ/cm2 as measured with a research radiometer fitted with a UV light probe at 285 ± 5 nm (model IL1700 A; International Light, Newburyport, MA) (56Maeda T.

Sham-irradiated cultures were handled identically, except that they were shielded with aluminum foil during irradiation. After irradiation, cells were given fresh medium lacking T-oligos.Western Blot Analysis—Total cellular proteins were collected as described previously (46Eller M.S. Ostrom K. Gilchrest B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1087-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Concentrations were determined by the BioRad method, and 50 μg of protein were run in each lane on a 10% denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Antibody reactions were performed with the following antibodies: phospho-p53Ser15 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), p53 DO-1, COX-2, NFκB/p65, and actin (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Western blot analysis was then performed as described (46Eller M.S. Ostrom K. Gilchrest B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1087-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) using consensus p53 and NFκB oligonucleotides (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 5 μg of nuclear protein from variously treated cells were carried out as described previously (59Kishore R. Spyridopoulos I. Luedemann C. Losordo D.W. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Reactions were electrophoresed on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, dried, and processed for autoradiography. For competition experiments, 50–100-fold excess of unlabeled DNA were added to the reaction 20 min before the addition of radiolabeled probe.Transfection Studies—Constructs containing the full-length phPES2(-1432/+59) human Cox-2 promoter, a deletion construct of phPES2(-327/+59), and an NFκB binding region site-specific mutant of phPES2(-327/+59) attached to a luciferase reporter (60Inoue H.

The pGL2 vector used for cloning the reporter construct was obtained from Promega (pGL2-Basic, Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and was used as an empty vector control. A plasmid containing Renilla luciferase (pRL-CMV, Promega Corp., Madison, WI) was co-transfected as a control for transfection efficiency. R2FWT and R2FDD cells were plated in 35-mm tissue culture dishes and incubated in R2F medium overnight to reach 50–60% confluence the next day. Cells were then transfected using the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two μg of plasmid DNA were co-transfected with 0.15 μg of the Renilla luciferase plasmid in each dish. After 4–6 h of transfection, cells were supplemented either with R2F medium alone (diluent) or R2F medium with 40 μm p9-mer or 100 μm pTT. Cells were then incubated for 24 and 48 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 before harvesting for dual-luciferase assay. Promoter activity was then assayed using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Firefly luciferase values were corrected for transfection efficiency according to Renilla luciferase values and revealed minimal differences in transfection efficiency among dishes. Luciferase activity was then expressed as percent of diluent value, setting diluent as 100%.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cell lysates were pre-cleaned with protein G-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4°C. Then 100 μg of total cell proteins were incubated with 2 μg of monoclonal p300 antibodies (GeneTex® Inc., San Antonio, TX), followed by the addition of protein G-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitated products were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described (62Kishore R. Luedemann C. Bord E. Goukassian D. Losordo D.W. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 932-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). After transferring proteins to nitrocellulose membrane antibody reactions were performed with NFκB (p65) antibodies and p53 (DO-1) (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Human Skin Explant Studies—Human skin fragments from healthy donors (aged 56 ± 15 years, mean ± S.D.) were brought to the laboratory within 30 min after excision during plastic or facial reconstructive surgery. After removing subcutaneous fat and deep dermis, skin was cut into 5 × 5-mm squares and placed in 60-mm tissue culture dishes. Paired skin explants were then incubated in either medium alone or medium supplemented with 100 μm pTT or 40 μm p9-mer for 24 h. Medium consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum plus KBM-2 with growth factors (50/50 v/v). The skin explants were then irradiated with a single dose of 30 mJ/cm2 UVB. One set was sham-irradiated as a negative control. For each treatment, one explant was harvested immediately after UVB irradiation. The dishes were then re-fed with fresh medium lacking T-oligos, and explants were harvested at 6, 18, and 24 h after UVB irradiation. Harvested skin was snap-frozen at -80 °C in OCT medium for later processing.Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence—Snap-frozen human skin explants were processed for staining by cutting 4–6-μm sections and fixing them in acetone for 10 min at -20 °C. COX-2 staining was performed using the Ultravision Detection System (TQ-015-HA, Labvision Corp., Fremont, CA) according to manufacturer's protocol. Primary antibodies used included anti-COX-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), human anti-p53 DO-7 (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA), and anti-phospho-p53Ser15 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). For the p53 DO-7 and p53Ser15 stainings, sections were blocked in 10% goat normal serum in Tris-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Sections were then washed in Tris-buffered saline three times for 5 min each before being incubated with the appropriate fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody at 37 °C for 45 min. Finally, sections were washed as before and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to visualize nuclei and were stored at -20 °C. We delineated ≈10-μm × 1-mm areas using computer-assisted image analysis and counted p53total and p53Ser15 (+) nuclei in the epidermis. For each time point we analyzed an average of three randomly selected visual fields of p53total and p53Ser15-stained epidermis from three to five donors per treatment condition. To avoid bias all counts were done by a single investigator for whom all samples were blinded by another investigator.Statistical Analysis—Difference in protein expression, Cox-2 promoter activity, and p53total and p53Ser15 (+) nuclei in T-oligo versus control-treated samples were analyzed by the analysis of variance post hoc analysis using the StatView statistical program (SAS Institute, Gary, NC). Groups were considered different when p < 0.05 (50Goukassian D.A. Bagheri S. el-Keeb L. Eller M.S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa LigD consists of a central ATP-dependent ligase domain fused to a C-terminal polymerase domain and an N-terminal 3′-phosphoesterase (PE) module. The PE domain catalyzes manganese-dependent phosphodiesterase and phosphomonoesterase reactions at a duplex primer-template with a short 3′-ribonucleotide tract. The phosphodiesterase, which cleaves a 3′-terminal diribonucleotide to yield a primer strand with a ribonucleoside 3′-PO4 terminus, requires the vicinal 2′-OH of the penultimate ribose. The phosphomonoesterase converts the terminal ribonucleoside 3′-PO4 to a 3′-OH. Here we show that the PE domain has a 3′-phosphatase activity on an all-DNA primer-template, signifying that the phosphomonoesterase reaction does not depend on a 2′-OH. The distinctions between the phosphodiesterase and phosphomonoesterase activities are underscored by the results of alanine-scanning, limited proteolysis, and deletion analysis, which show that the two reactions depend on overlapping but nonidentical ensembles of protein functional groups, including: (i) side chains essential for both ribonuclease and phosphatase activity (His-42, His-48, Asp-50, Arg-52, His-84, and Tyr-88); (ii) side chains important for 3′-phosphatase activity but not for 3′ ribonucleoside removal (Arg-14, Asp-15, Glu-21, Gln-40, and Glu-82); and (iii) side chains required selectively for the 3′-ribonuclease (Lys-66 and Arg-76). These constellations of critical residues are unique to LigD-like proteins, which we propose comprise a new bifunctional phosphoesterase family.

For example, Mycobacterium LigD consists of an N-terminal Pol domain, a central PE domain, and a C-terminal Lig domain, whereas Pseudomonas LigD is composed of an N-terminal PE domain, a central Lig domain, and a C-terminal Pol domain. The need for a DNA ligase in NHEJ is self-evident. The LigD Pol domain catalyzes in vitro both template-dependent fill-in of 5′-overhangs and the nontemplated addition of single nucleotides at blunt ends (2Gong C. Bongiorno P. Martins A. Stephanou N.C. Zhu H. Shuman S. Glickman M.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 4Della M. Palmbos P.L. Tseng H.M. Tonkin L.M. Daley J.M.

Bongiorno P. Martins A. Stephanou N.C. Zhu H. Shuman S. Glickman M.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the Pol domain is responsible for insertional mutagenesis during NHEJ. A significant fraction of the mutagenic NHEJ events cataloged in vivo entailed nucleolytic resection at one or both ends prior to the resealing step (2Gong C. Bongiorno P. Martins A. Stephanou N.C. Zhu H. Shuman S. Glickman M.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It is not yet clear whether LigD is the direct agent of DNA end resection during NHEJ. Initial informatics analysis of LigD highlighted clusters of conserved histidines and aspartates within the PE domain that were predicted to form a metal-coordinating cluster composed of β-strands. On this basis, a deoxynuclease function was suggested (5Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1365-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Mycobacterium tuberculosis LigD was reported to have an associated metal-dependent DNA 3′-exonuclease activity (4Della M. Palmbos P.L. Tseng H.M. Tonkin L.M. Daley J.M. Topper L.M. Pitcher R.S. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson T.E. Doherty A.J. Science. 2004; 306: 683-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated a 3′-ribonuclease/3′-phosphatase activity of Pseudomonas LigD, whereby it resects a short tract of 3′-ribonucleotides on a primer-template substrate to the point at which the primer strand has a single 3′-ribonucleotide remaining (8Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25973-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The failure to digest beyond this point reflects a requirement for a 2′-OH group on the penultimate nucleoside of the primer strand. Replacing the 2′-OHbya 2′-F, 2′-NH2, 2′-OCH3, or 2′-H abolishes the resection reaction (8Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25973-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The ribonucleotide resection activity resides within the 187-amino-acid N-terminal PE domain and is the result of at least two component steps: (i) the 3′-terminal nucleoside is first removed to yield a primer strand with a ribonucleoside 3′-PO4 terminus and (ii) the 3′-PO4 is hydrolyzed toa3′-OH. The 3′-ribonuclease and 3′-phosphatase activities are both dependent on manganese. Here we show that the PE domain also catalyzes hydrolysis of the 3′-PO4 of an all-DNA primer-template substrate, thereby establishing that the 2′-OH of the terminal nucleoside is not required for the phosphomonoesterase reaction. LigD preferentially cleaves the 3′-PO4 of a duplex primer-template substrate rather than a single-stranded DNA of identical composition. The PE domain of Pseudomonas LigD and its bacterial homologs has no apparent structural or mechanistic similarity to previously characterized nucleases or 3′-phosphatases. Thus, we speculated that it exemplifies a novel phosphoesterase family (8Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25973-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). An initial alanine scan of five residues of Pseudomonas LigD identified Asp-50, Arg-52, and His-84 as essential for both the 3′-ribonuclease and 3′-phosphatase reactions; Glu-82 was specifically required for the 3′-phosphatase activity but not for initial ribonucleoside resection. Here we extended the alanine scan to 11 other conserved amino acids. We focused on: (i) histidines (His-42 and His-48) as potential general acid/base catalysts or ligands for manganese, (ii) basic residues (Arg-14, Arg-46, Lys-66, and Arg-76) as candidate ligands for the reactive phosphodiester and 3′-phosphate moieties, (iii) acidic groups (Asp-15, Glu-21, and Asp-83) as potential metal ligands, and (iv) polar side chains (Gln-40 and Tyr-88) with potential for hydrogen bonding to the primer-template substrate. Mutational effects fell into several classes: (i) those that abolished or severely impeded both the phosphodiesterase and phosphomonoesterase functions, (ii) those that selectively impaired the phosphodiesterase, and (iii) those that selectively affected the phosphomonoesterase. These results indicate that the active sites for the ribonuclease and phosphatase functions overlap but are not identical. PE Domain of LigD—A gene fragment encoding LigD-(1–187) (PE domain) was amplified by PCR with sense strand primers that introduced an NdeI restriction site at the beginning of the open reading frame and an antisense primer that introduced a new stop codon and a flanking BamHI site. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and inserted into pET16b to generate an expression plasmid pET-PaeLigD-PE that encodes a His10-tagged version of the PE domain. Alanine mutations and N-terminal deletions were introduced into the plasmid as described previously (8Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25973-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The inserts of the mutant plasmids were sequenced completely to exclude the acquisition of unwanted changes during amplification and cloning. The plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Induction of protein expression with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, preparation of soluble bacterial lysates, and purification of the recombinant PE proteins by nickel-agarose affinity chromatography were performed as described previously (8Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25973-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The 200 mm imidazole eluate fractions containing the PE domain were stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard. 3′-Ribonuclease Assay—Reaction mixtures (80 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 50 nm 5′ 32P-labeled D10R2 primer-template (see Fig. 2), and 5 μm LigD PE domain were incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots (10 μl) were withdrawn at the times specified and quenched by adjusting the mixtures to 7 mm EDTA and 31% formamide. The products were resolved by electrophoresis through a 40-cm 18% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in Tris borate-EDTA. The products were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by scanning the gel with a Fujifilm BAS-2500 imaging apparatus. 3′-Phosphatase Assay—The 5′ 32P-labeled, 3′ phosphate-terminated D9R1-p strand was prepared by digesting a 5′ 32P-labeled D9R3 primer oligonucleotide with ribonuclease A as described previously (8Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25973-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The labeled D9R1-p oligonucleotide was annealed to a 4-fold excess of an unlabeled complementary 24-mer DNA strand. The 3′-phosphatase reaction mixtures (80 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 25 nm 5′ 32P-labeled D9R1-p primer-template (see Fig. 4), and 5 μm LigD PE domain were incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots (10 μl) were withdrawn at the times specified and quenched with EDTA/formamide. The products were resolved by denaturing gel electrophoresis as described above. The extent of conversion of the 3′-PO4 oligonucleotide to the slower migrating 3′-OH product was determined by scanning the gel with a Fujifilm BAS-2500 imaging apparatus. DNA 3′-Phosphatase Assay—The 5′ 32P-labeled, 3′ phosphate-terminated D11-p strand was prepared by reaction of the 11-mer 5′-OH, 3′-PO4 oligodeoxynucleotide 5′-CAATTGCGACCp (purchased from BIOSOURCE) with the N-terminal 5′-kinase domain of T4 polynucleotide kinase (33Wang L.K. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26868-26874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and [γ-32P]ATP. The labeled 11-mer was purified by native gel electrophoresis and then annealed to a 4-fold excess of an unlabeled complementary 24-mer DNA strand. The DNA 3′-phosphatase reaction mixtures (80 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 50 nm 5′ 32P-labeled D11-p primer-template (see Fig. 5), and 5 μm LigD PE domain were incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots (10 μl) were withdrawn at the times specified and quenched with EDTA/formamide. The products were resolved by denaturing gel electrophoresis as described above. The extent of conversion of the 3′-PO4 oligonucleotide to the slower migrating 3′-OH product was determined by scanning the gel. Limited Proteolysis of Tag-free PE Domain—To prepare the native tag-free PE domain, we initially produced LigD-(1–187) in E. coli as a His10-Smt3 fusion, purified the fusion protein from a soluble extract by nickel-agarose chromatography, removed the His10-Smt3 tag by digestion with the Smt3-specific protease Ulp1 (9Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), and then purified the tag-free PE domain away from His10-Smt3 by nickel-agarose chromatography. Aliquots (10 μg) of the native PE domain were digested for 15 min at 22 °C with 0, 25, 50, 100, or 200 ng of trypsin or chymotrypsin. The digests were resolved by SDS-PAGE (15% polyacrylamide), and the polypeptides were transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and then stained with Coomassie Blue. Proteolytic fragments were excised from the membrane and subjected to at least six cycles of automated Edman chemistry to determine the N-terminal amino acid sequence. Mutational Effects on Ribonucleotide Resection—Wild-type and mutated versions of the N-terminal PE domain of Pseudomonas LigD were produced in E. coli as His10 fusions and purified from soluble bacterial lysates by nickel-agarose chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis verified that the preparations were enriched to the same extent with respect to the PE polypeptide, which migrated anomalously at ∼29 kDa (predicted size 24 kDa) (Fig. 1). Mutational effects on 3′-ribonucleotide resection were gauged by kinetic analysis of the reaction of the PE protein with a 5′ 32P-labeled D10R2 primer-template under conditions of enzyme excess (Fig. 2). Wild-type PE initially converted the labeled strand to a 3′-phosphorylated species, D10R1-p, which was subsequently converted to a more slowly migrating 3′-OH end product, D10R1 (Fig. 2). Distinct classes of mutational effects were apparent from the extent of substrate decay and the distribution of the reaction products: (i) the H42A and H48A changes effectively abolished the 3′ resection activity; (ii) the rates of substrate decay by the K66A, R76A, and Y88A mutants were much slower than wild-type; (iii) the rates of substrate consumption by the R14A, D15A, E21A, and Q40A mutants were similar to wild-type, and the normally transient D10R1-p intermediate accumulated as a predominant product; and (iv) the rates of substrate decay by the D83A and R46A mutants were similar to, or moderately slower than, the wild-type PE domain, and the D10R1-p intermediate was efficiently converted to the D10R1 end product. These results implicate Arg-14, Asp-15, Glu-21, and Gln-40 as candidate catalysts of the 3′-phosphatase reaction, insofar as alanine substitutions had qualitatively selective effects on the 3′-PO4 hydrolysis step of the overall ribonucleotide resection reaction. The impact of Ala mutations on the rate of the phosphodiesterase reaction was quantified in Fig. 3A by plotting the sum of the D10R1-p and D10R1 reaction products (expressed as the fraction of total radiolabeled material) as a function of time. This analysis revealed that the Arg-14, Asp-15, Glu-21, and Asp-83 mutants were similar to wild-type with respect to the initial rate (see TABLE ONE) and extent of 3′-ribonucleoside removal. We infer that these side chains, although conserved among the PE domain proteins, do not contribute to the phosphodiesterase active site. The H42A and H48A proteins displayed ≤0.1% of the wild-type rate and are thereby candidate components of the 3′-ribonuclease catalytic site. The initial rates of the Y88A, K66A, and R76A proteins were 7.1, 2.9, and 1.1% of the wild-type rate, respectively. Our working definition of a functionally important residue is one for which alanine substitution reduced activity to ≤10% of wild-type. We therefore regard Tyr-88, Lys-66, and Arg-76 as important for 3′-ribonucleoside removal. The modest effects of the Q40A and R46A mutations on the reaction rate (41 and 16% of wild-type) do not meet the criterion for designating either Gln-40 or Arg-46 as candidate catalytic residues for the 3′-ribonuclease reaction.TABLE ONEMutational effects on phosphodiesterase and phosphomonoesterase activityProtein3′-RNase (D10R2)3′-Pase (D9R1-p)3′-Pase (D11-p)WT100100100R14A770.20.1D15A1103.34.9E21A130≤0.1≤0.1Q40A416.78.6H42A≤0.1≤0.10.2R46A161967H48A≤0.10.80.2K66A2.92848R76A1.11644D83A575170Y88A7.10.2≤0.1 Open table in a new tab Mutational Effects on 3′-Phosphatase Activity—A kinetic analysis of the reaction of the PE proteins with a 5′ 32P-labeled D9R1-p primer-template under conditions of enzyme excess is shown in Fig. 4 and quantified in Fig. 3B. Wild-type PE converted nearly all of the input labeled strand to a slower migrating D9R1-OH species; the kinetic profile fit well to a single exponential with an apparent rate constant of 0.004 s–1. Mutants R14A, E21A, H42A, H48A, and Y88A were virtually inert in the isolated 3′-phosphatase reaction (<1% of the wild-type rate; see TABLE ONE). Mutants D15A and Q40A were weakly active, with initial rates being 3.3 and 6.7% of wild-type, respectively. The R46A, K66A, R76A, and D83A mutants retained substantial 3′-phosphatase activity, their initial rates being 19, 28, 16, and 51% of the wild-type, respectively. Taken together, the kinetic analyses of 3′-ribonucleotide resection and the isolated 3′-phosphatase reaction (TABLE ONE) highlight three classes of functionally relevant side chains: (i) those that are essential/important for both ribonuclease and phosphatase activity (His-42, His-48, and Tyr-88); (ii) those essential/important for 3′-phosphatase activity but not for 3′-ribonucleoside removal (Arg-14, Asp-15, Glu-21, and Gln-40); (iii) those that are important for 3′-ribonuclease but have only a modest effect on 3′-phosphatase (Lys-66 and Arg-76). DNA 3′-Phosphatase Activity of LigD—Although the 3′-phosphodiesterase activity of LigD is strictly dependent on a 2′-OH of the penultimate nucleoside (8Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25973-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the role of the terminal 2′-OH in the 3′-phosphomonoesterase reaction has not been tested. To address this issue, we prepared an all-DNA primer-template composed of an 11-mer 5′ 32P-labeled, 3′-PO4 oligodeoxyribonucleotide (D11-p) annealed to a 24-mer oligonucleotide to form the substrate shown in Fig. 5. The LigD PE domain converted the labeled D11-p strand to a slower migrating species, D11-OH. The extent of dephosphorylation of the D11-p primer-template was proportional to the amount of input PE domain (Fig. 5A) and required a divalent cation, specifically manganese (not shown). We estimated from the slope of the titration curve (Fig. 5C) that ∼1.3 pmol of ends were repaired/pmol of PE domain. The specific activity of the PE domain on the D11-p primer-template was ∼16-fold higher than its specific activity on the D9R1-p primer-template (not shown). A kinetic analysis of the DNA 3′-phosphatase reaction under conditions of enzyme excess is shown in Figs. 5B and 6. The reaction was complete in 2–5 min; the data fit well to a single exponential with an apparent rate constant of 0.024 s–1 (compared with 0.004 s–1 for dephosphorylation of D9R1-p under identical conditions). These results demonstrated that a terminal 2′-OH is not required for the 3′ phosphomonoesterase activity and that a DNA 3′-PO4 primer-template is a more effective substrate than a structurally similar primer-template with a ribonucleoside 3′-PO4 end. The dependence of the DNA 3′-phosphatase activity on the DNA template strand was gauged by comparing the D11-p primer-template to the D11-p single strand (Fig. 5C). The 3′-phosphatase specific activity on the primer-template substrate was ∼130-fold greater than on the primer alone. Thus, the DNA 3′-phosphatase reaction, similar to the reaction at a ribonucleoside 3′-phosphate end (8Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25973-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), displays a fairly stringent requirement for the template DNA strand. A kinetic analysis of the reaction of the collection of mutant PE proteins with the 5′ 32P-labeled D11-p primer-template under conditions of enzyme excess is shown in Fig. 6; initial rates were quantified (Fig. 3C) and normalized to the rate of the wild-type enzyme (TABLE ONE). The R14A, E21A, H42A, H48A, and Y88A proteins were inactive (<1% of the wild-type rate). D15A and Q40A displayed feeble activity (4.9 and 8.6% of wild-type, respectively). R46A, K66A, R76A, and D83A were 67, 48, 44, and 70% as active as the wild-type, respectively. The hierarchy of mutational effects on DNA 3′-phosphatase activity agreed with the results obtained for phosphomonoesterase activity on the D9R1-p primer-template (TABLE ONE), which implies that the PE domain exploits the same active site for 3′-phosphate hydrolysis at a ribonucleotide or deoxyribonucleotide end. Structure Probing by Limited Proteolysis—Native tag-free PE domain was subjected to proteolysis with increasing amounts of trypsin or chymotrypsin, and the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 7). Initial scission by trypsin yielded two major fragments, T1 and T2. N-terminal sequencing revealed that the T1 fragment arose via cleavage between Arg-17 and Gln-18; the T2 fragment resulted from scission between Arg-28 and Lys-29 (cleavage sites indicated by arrows in Fig. 7). Although the T1 fragment decayed completely as the trypsin concentration was increased, the T2 fragment persisted at up to 200 ng of trypsin, a level at least 8-fold higher than that sufficient to digest all of the input native protein (Fig. 7). Thus, we surmised that the T2 fragment comprises a trypsin-resistant domain. Minor tryptic fragments T3 and T4 had the same N termini as the T2 fragment, indicating that they arose via trimming of C-terminal peptides. Treatment with chymotrypsin yielded two major products, C1 and C2, which were generated by cleavage at the Tyr-10/Ala-11 (C1) and Phe-16/Arg-17 (C2) dipeptides, respectively. The C1 fragment was consumed as the chymotrypsin concentration was increased, but the C2 fragment was stable (Fig. 7). Note that the C2 cleavage site is 1 residue upstream from the T1 tryptic site (Fig. 7). These results suggest that the N-terminal segment of the PE domain is either disordered or exposed on the protein surface. N-terminal Deletions of the PE Domain—The protease-sensitive N-terminal segment of the PE domain is hydrophilic; 13 of the first 30 side chains are either positively or negatively charged (Fig. 7). Included within the N-terminal segment are three functional groups (Arg-14, Asp-15, and Glu-21), that were identified in the alanine scan as important for 3′-phosphatase activity. To further probe the function of the N terminus, we produced a series of four truncated versions of the PE domain, with new N-terminal sites corresponding to the N termini of proteolytic fragments C1, C2, T1, and T2. The proteins were produced in bacteria as His10 fusions and purified from soluble extracts by nickel-agarose chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed similar purities and the expected decrements in electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 8A). Assay of the truncated proteins for 3′ resection of the D10R2 primer-template showed that they readily cleaved the terminal phosphodiester to form D11R1-p but were slowed in removing the 3′-PO4 to form the D10R1 end product (Fig. 8B). A plot of the sum of the D10R1-p and D10R1 reaction products (expressed as the fraction of total radiolabeled material) as a function of time showed that the initial rates of the C1, C2, T1, and T2 proteins were 83, 78, 100, and 100% of the wild-type rate, respectively (Fig. 8C). Assays of 3′-phosphomonoesterase activity with the D11-p primer-template showed that the initial rates of the C1, C2, T1, and T2 proteins were 26, 0.2, 0.1, and 0.2% of the wild-type rate, respectively (Fig. 8D). Thus, deletion of the N-terminal protease-sensitive fragment phenocopied the separation-of-function effects of point mutations within the N-terminal segment. We conclude that the N-terminal peptide of LigD is implicated in catalysis of the phosphomonoesterase reaction but not required for the phosphodiesterase reaction. Pseudomonas LigD is composed of phosphoesterase, ligase, and polymerase modules. It is homologous to mycobacterial LigD, which plays a critical role in an NHEJ pathway of DNA repair in vivo (2Gong C. Bongiorno P. Martins A. Stephanou N.C. Zhu H. Shuman S. Glickman M.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Here we showed via several criteria the separation of the phosphodiesterase and phosphomonoesterase functions of the PE domain. The key mechanistic distinction between the two activities is that the 3′-phosphodiesterase requires a 2′-OH, whereas the 3′-phosphomonoesterase does not. The available data are consistent with a mechanism whereby the 2′-OH is a direct participant in the chemistry of the phosphodiesterase reaction, perhaps acting as a nucleophile to form a transient 2′,3′ cyclic phosphodiester species that is converted to a 3′-PO4 end. The resulting 3′-PO4 end precludes nucleotide addition by polymerases and strand sealing by ligases. Thus, the 3′ terminus needs to be healed by the 3′-phosphomonoesterase of LigD, which we propose occurs by direct attack of water to liberate Pi and leave a 3′-OH end. The finding that LigD has a vigorous DNA 3′-phosphatase suggests a wider role for this activity in break repair, not confined to the resection of 3′-ribonucleotide tracts from broken DNA ends discussed previously (8Zhu H.

Levitz R. Kaufman G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2499-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Because the PE domain of LigD has no apparent structural or mechanistic similarity to either exonuclease III or mammalian/T4 polynucleotide kinase-phosphatase, we propose that it exemplifies a new family of 3′ end-healing enzymes. Our mutational analysis provides additional evidence that the phosphodiesterase and phosphomonoesterase activities rely on distinct structural components of the PE domain. In particular, mutations of a constellation of three conserved residues (Arg-14, Asp-15, and Glu-21) located within the protease-sensitive N-terminal segment selectively impair the 3′-phosphomonoesterase activity of LigD. Deletion of the protease-sensitive N terminus elicited a similar loss of phosphomonoesterase activity, with relatively little impact on the phosphodiesterase. Mutations at two residues within the protease-resistant body of the PE domain, Gln-40 and Glu-82 (8Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25973-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), also selectively affected the 3′-phosphatase reaction. Therefore, we surmise that the active sites for the phosphomonoesterase and phosphodiesterase are not identical, although they likely overlap. Although we cannot conclude from the present results exactly how Arg-14, Asp-15, Glu-21, Gln-40, and Glu-82 contribute to the catalysis of 3′-phosphate removal, we can infer from the concordant mutational effects with the D11-p and D9R1-p primer-templates that there is likely a single active site for 3′-phosphate removal at a deoxynucleoside or ribonucleoside terminus. Why might the 3′-phosphomonoesterase reaction call upon additional active site residues that are not required for the 3′-ribonuclease? Conceivably, the extra charge on the ground state and transition state of the 3′-phosphate compared with that of the 3′-terminal phosphodiester engenders a need for an additional basic residue, such as Arg-14, or a polar functional group, such as Gln-40. The acidic side chains Asp-15, Glu-21, or Glu-82 might play a role in either orienting or activating the water nucleophile or in donating a proton to the 3′-O-leaving group. The effects of alanine mutations at Arg-14 and Glu-21 (and of N-terminal deletions C2, T1, and T2) on the isolated 3′-phosphatase reactions with either the D9R1-p or D11-p primer-templates were apparently more severe than their impact on the 3′-PO4 removal step of the ribonucleotide resection mechanism assayed using the D10R2 primer-template. For example, although the R14A, E21A, and T1 proteins generated virtually no 3′-OH products during a 30-min reaction with the 3′-PO4 primer-template substrates (Figs. 4, 7, and 8D), they clearly did convert a fraction of the D10R1-p intermediate to D10R1-OH during the 30-min ribonucleotide resection assay (Figs. 2 and 8B). A simple interpretation of the “leakiness” of the phosphatase-defective mutations using the D10R2 primer-template substrate is that the requirement for certain constituents of the phosphatase active site is more stringent when the 3′-PO4 substrate must be engaged by the enzyme from solution than when the 3′-PO4 terminus is formed in situ on the enzyme by the action of the phosphodiesterase catalytic center. This line of thinking posits that, under the reaction conditions employed in our studies, the 3′-PO4 intermediate in the ribonucleotide resection reaction is retained at the active site of the enzyme, where it is immediately accessible to the phosphomonoesterase (without the need for dissociation and rebinding). Six amino acids have now been identified as essential/important for both the 3′-ribonuclease and 3′-phosphatase functions. Mutations of His-42, His-48, Asp-50, Arg-52, and His-84 abolish virtually all activity, and mutation of Tyr-88 reduces ribonuclease and phosphatase activity to 7 and ≤1% of wild-type, respectively. Either these six side chains are essential for global folding of the PE domain or they contribute essential components of an overlapping active site for the phosphodiesterase and phosphomonoesterase functions. Limited tryptic digestion of the H42A, H48A, D50A, R52A, H84A, and Y88A proteins revealed a pattern of resistant fragments that was virtually identical to that of the wild-type PE protein (data not shown); thus we suspect that the essential residues are not critical for global folding. Rather, we propose that they are catalytic residues at a shared active site that perform functions common to both the phosphodiesterase and phosphomonoesterase reactions, e.g. coordination of the essential manganese cofactor (possibly by His-42, His-48, Asp-50, and His-84) and stabilization of the transition state on the reactive phosphate (by Arg-52 and perhaps one of the histidines). In summary, our biochemical analysis of the PE domain of LigD reveals unexpected complexity whereby overlapping but nonidentical protein functional groups are responsible for catalysis of the mechanistically distinct phosphodiesterase and phosphomonoesterase reactions. Although a detailed reaction scheme will hinge on obtaining an atomic structure of the PE domain, the loss-of-function and separation-of-function mutations characterized here provide a set of genetic tools to gauge the roles of the phosphomonoesterase and phosphodiesterase reactions in LigD-dependent DNA repair pathways in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2058156923,"Tgs1 is the enzyme responsible for converting 7-methylguanosine RNA caps to the 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine cap structures of small nuclear and small nucleolar RNAs. Whereas budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe encode a single Tgs1 protein, the primitive eukaryote Giardia lamblia encodes two paralogs, Tgs1 and Tgs2. Here we show that purified Tgs2 is a monomeric enzyme that catalyzes methyl transfer from AdoMet (Km of 6 μm) to m7GDP (Km of 65 μm; kcat of 14 min–1) to form m2,7GDP. Tgs2 also methylates m7GTP (Km of 30 μm; kcat of 13 min–1) and m7GpppA (Km of 7 μm; kcat) of 14 min–1 but is unreactive with GDP, GTP, GpppA, ATP, CTP, or UTP. We find that the conserved residues Asp-68, Glu-91, and Trp-143 are essential for Tgs2 methyltransferase activity in vitro. The m2,7GDP product formed by Tgs2 can be converted to m2,2,7GDP by S. pombe Tgs1 in the presence of excess AdoMet. However, Giardia Tgs2 itself is apparently unable to add a second methyl group at guanine-N2. This result implies that 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine caps in Giardia are either synthesized by Tgs1 alone or by the sequential action of Tgs2 and Tgs1. The specificity of Tgs2 raises the prospect that some Giardia mRNAs might contain dimethylguanosine caps.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4899-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggested that Tgs1 might be directly involved in TMG formation. Biochemical studies of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Tgs1 showed that it is indeed a catalyst of TMG synthesis (6Hausmann S. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4021-4024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Methylation of guanine-N2 by S. pombe Tgs1 in vitro is strictly dependent on the prior methylation of guanine-N7, indicating that TMG caps are formed by post-transcriptional methylation of standard m7G caps (6Hausmann S.

Although early models suggested that the TMG synthase reaction might require cis-acting RNA signals or the assembly of specific ribonucleoprotein structures (7Mattaj I.W.

Given the ubiquity of TMG caps in eukaryotic species, it is surprising that an S. cerevisiae tgs1 deletion mutant is viable, even though the small nuclear RNAs and small nucleolar RNAs in the tgs1Δ strain lack TMG caps (4Mouaikel J. Verheggen C. Bertrand E. Tazi J. Bordonné R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis indicates that Tgs1 is also nonessential for growth of S. pombe. 3B. Schwer, unpublished observations.3B. Schwer, unpublished observations. In contrast, TMG synthesis is essential in Drosophila, where mutations in the putative Tgs1 active site cause lethality at the early pupal stage of development that correlates with depletion of TMG-containing RNAs (11Komonyi O. Papai G. Enunlu I. Muratoglu S. Pankotai T. Kopitova D. Maróy P. Udvarty A. Boros I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12397-12404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The protozoan parasite Giardia lamblia is posited to occupy a deeply branching position in eukaryotic phylogeny. Analysis of the Giardia genome is providing important insights to the early origins of RNA processing mechanisms that are regarded as uniquely eukaryotic (12Nixon J.E.J. Wang A. Morrison H.G.

Although there had been some debate whether Giardia mRNAs even have a 5′-cap structure (13Yu D.C. Wang A.L. Botka C.W. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem.

Microbiol. 1999; 34: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), recent studies show that Giardia does possess the enzymatic machinery for m7G cap synthesis (15Hausmann S.

Chem. 2005; 280: 12077-12086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), caps the 5′ ends of its mRNAs, and exploits the m7G cap for enhanced translation of a reporter mRNA in vivo (15Hausmann S.

The fact that Giardia encodes two homologs of the cap-binding translation initiation factor eIF4E (17Li L. Wang C.C. Eukaryotic Cell. 2005; 4: 948-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) suggests that Giardia is not an exception to the general reliance on the cap structure for optimal gene expression in eukaryotes. However, characterization of the Giardia eIF4E proteins revealed that one paralog, eIF4E2, binds to m7G caps, whereas the other paralog, eIF4E1, binds to m2,2,7G caps (17Li L. Wang C.C. Eukaryotic Cell. 2005; 4: 948-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The existence of a TMG-specific cap-binding protein is consistent with an early study identifying several small RNAs in Giardia that reacted with antibody to the TMG cap (18Niu X.H. Hartshorne T. He X.Y. Agabian N. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because transfected TMG-capped mRNAs are not translated in Giardia (17Li L. Wang C.C. Eukaryotic Cell. 2005; 4: 948-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), it is inferred that eIF4E1 and TMG-capped RNAs are involved in RNA transactions unrelated to bulk mRNA translation. The apparent complexity of cap function in Giardia is highlighted by our finding of two Tgs-like proteins in this primitive organism. One of the Tgs paralogs, which we name Tgs1, is a 300-amino acid polypeptide that is 32% identical to S. pombe Tgs1 over a 174-amino acid segment of sequence similarity that is shown in Fig. 1. The second paralog, Tgs2, is a 258-amino acid polypeptide that is 25% identical to S. pombe Tgs1 across this segment. Giardia Tgs1 and Tgs2 are 22% identical to each other over the same region. To assess what biochemical activities, if any, are associated with the Giardia Tgs homologs, we produced the recombinant proteins in bacteria. Giardia Tgs1 was intractably insoluble despite the use of several expression and tagging strategies and was therefore not amenable to study. Giardia Tgs2 was expressed as a soluble His10 fusion and purified for enzymatic and physical characterization. We report that Tgs2 is a monomeric m7G-specific N2 methyltransferase that catalyzes addition of a single methyl group to form a 2,7-dimethylguanosine cap. Recombinant Giardia Tgs2—The open reading frame encoding Tgs2 (GenBank™ accession number EAA46438) was amplified from G. lamblia genomic DNA with primers that introduced an NdeI site at the start codon and a BglII site 3′ of the stop codon. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BglII and inserted into pET16b. The resulting pET-His10Tgs2 plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21CodonPlus(DE3). A 500-ml culture amplified from a single transformant was grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol until the A600 reached 0.6. The culture was adjusted to 2% ethanol and 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and then incubated at 17 °C for 20 h with constant shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was stored at –80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 25 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol). Cell lysis was achieved by the addition of lysozyme to 100 μg/ml. The lysate was sonicated to reduce viscosity, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The soluble extract was applied to a 1-ml column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 10 ml of the same buffer and then eluted stepwise with 2-ml aliquots of buffer A containing 50, 100, 250, and 500 mm imidazole. The polypeptide compositions of the column fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE. The recombinant His10-Tgs2 polypeptide was recovered predominantly in the 250 mm imidazole fractions. The 250 mm imidazole eluate was dialyzed against a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol and then stored at –80 °C. The protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad dye reagent using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The single alanine mutations D68A, E91A, and W143A were introduced into the TGS2 gene by the PCR-based two-stage overlap extension method (32Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6810) Google Scholar). The mutated genes were inserted into the pET16b. The inserts were sequenced completely to exclude the acquisition of unwanted mutations during amplification and cloning. The D68A, E91A, and W143A proteins were produced in E. coli and isolated from soluble bacterial extracts as described above for wild-type Tgs2. Methyltransferase Assay—Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm DTT, 50 μm [methyl-3H]AdoMet, 2.5 mm m7GDP, and enzyme were incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots (4 μl) were spotted on PEI-cellulose TLC plates, which were developed with 0.05 m ammonium sulfate. The AdoMet- and m2,7GDP-containing portions of the lanes were cut out, and the radioactivity in each was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Glycerol Gradient Sedimentation—An aliquot (40 μg) of the nickel-agarose preparation of Tgs2 was mixed with catalase (45 μg), bovine serum albumin (45 μg), and cytochrome c (45 μg). The mixture was applied to a 4.8-ml 15–30% glycerol gradient containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT. The gradient was centrifuged for 18 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW50 rotor at 50,000 rpm. Fractions (∼0.19 ml) were collected from the bottom of the tube. Materials—[methyl-3H]AdoMet was purchased from New England Nuclear. m7GTP, m7GDP, AdoMet, AdoHcy sinefungin, and sodium periodate were purchased from Sigma. m7GpppA and GpppA were purchased from New England Biolabs. Tgs2 Is an AdoMet and m7G-dependent Methyltransferase—The Giardia Tgs2 protein was produced in E. coli asaHis10 fusion and purified from a soluble bacterial extract by adsorption to nickel-agarose and elution with imidazole (Fig. 2). The methyltransferase activity of Tgs2 was demonstrated by incubating increasing amounts of the protein with 50 μm [methyl-3H]AdoMet and 2.5 mm m7GDP at 37 °C, which, at saturating enzyme, resulted in 93% label transfer from AdoMet to the m7GDP (Fig. 2) to form a 3H-labeled product that was separated from the labeled AdoMet by PEI-cellulose TLC in 0.1 m ammonium sulfate (Fig. 3A). The labeled product (m2,7GDP; see below) migrated immediately ahead of the input m7GDP substrate, which was visualized by UV illumination of the chromatogram (not shown).FIGURE 3Methyl acceptor specificity of Tgs2. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm DTT, 50 μm [methyl-3H]AdoMet, the specified nucleotide at 2.5 mm(or no nucleotide where indicated by a dash), and 0.5 μg of Tgs2 were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Aliquots (4 μl) were spotted onto PEI-cellulose TLC plates that were developed with ammonium sulfate, either 0.1 m (panel A), 0.05 m (panel B), or 0.2 m (panel C). The chromatograms were treated with Enhance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 3H-labeled material was visualized by autoradiography. The methyltransferase reaction products m2,7GDP (panel A), m2,7GTP, and m2,7GpppA (panel B) and m2,7GTP (panel C) are denoted by arrowheads at the right of the chromatograms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The extent of methylation of m7GDP increased with time and was proportional to input enzyme (Fig. 4A). From the initial rate, we estimated a turnover number of 14 min–1. Methyl transfer activity was optimal at pH 7.5–9.0 in Tris-HCl buffer; activity declined to 32% of the optimum at pH 6.5 (Tris acetate), and was nil at pH ≤5.0 (Fig. 4B). Methylation of m7GDP by Tgs2 displayed a hyperbolic dependence on AdoMet concentration (Fig. 4C); from a double-reciprocal plot of the data we calculated a Km value of 6 μm AdoMet and kcat of 12 min–1. Methylation of 2.5 mm m7GDP in the presence of 50 μm [methyl-3H]AdoMet was inhibited in a concentration-dependent fashion by the product AdoHcy and the AdoMet analog sinefungin (Fig. 4D). The apparent IC50 values for AdoHcy and sinefungin were 75 and 45 μm, respectively. Thus, Tgs2 has similar affinity for AdoMet, AdoHcy, and sinefungin. Sedimentation Analysis of Tgs2—The recombinant protein was subjected to zonal velocity sedimentation in a 15–30% glycerol gradient (Fig. 5). Marker proteins catalase (native size 248 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and cytochrome c (12 kDa) were included as internal standards. His10-Tgs2 (calculated to be a 32-kDa polypeptide) sedimented as a discrete peak (fraction 19) between bovine serum albumin and cytochrome c. The methyltransferase activity profile paralleled the abundance of the Tgs2 polypeptide and peaked at fraction 19. We surmise from these results that the methyltransferase activity is intrinsic to Tgs2 and that the enzyme is a monomer in solution. Substrate Specificity and Affinity—Various nucleoside diphosphates were tested as methyl acceptors at a 2.5 mm concentration (Fig. 3). Whereas Tgs2 catalyzed near complete transfer of label from AdoMet to m7GDP, no new labeled product was formed in the presence of GDP, ADP, CDP, or UDP (Fig. 3A). Tgs2 also catalyzed near quantitative methyl transfer from AdoMet to m7GTP to form a major labeled product that migrated immediately ahead of the input m7GTP substrate during PEI-cellulose TLC in 0.2 m ammonium sulfate (Fig. 3C). A minor product migrating just slower than AdoMet was formed by reaction of Tgs2 with contaminating m7GDP nucleotide present in the commercial m7GTP preparation. Tgs2 was capable of near quantitative label transfer from AdoMet to the cap dinucleotide m7GpppA to form a single product, presumed to be m2,7GpppA, that was resolved from AdoMet by PEI-cellulose TLC in 0.05 m ammonium sulfate (Fig. 3B). This product migrated immediately ahead of the input m7GpppA substrate, which was visualized by UV illumination of the chromatogram (not shown). No novel product was formed in the presence of the unmethylated cap dinucleotide GpppA (Fig. 3B). Simultaneous TLC analysis of the reaction product formed with m7GTP revealed a major species (m2,7GTP) that barely migrated off the origin in 0.05 m ammonium sulfate plus a minor contaminant (m2,7GDP) that migrated slower than m2,7GpppA (Fig. 3B). Tgs2 formed no new labeled product when reacted with 2.5 mm GTP, ATP, CTP, or UTP (Fig. 3B). Collectively, these results highlight the requirement for prior N7 methylation of the guanine nucleotide substrate, which can be either a cap dinucleotide, a mononucleoside triphosphate, or a mononucleoside diphosphate. The extent of methyl transfer by Tgs2 in the presence of 50 μm AdoMet displayed a hyperbolic dependence on m7GDP (Fig. 6A) or m7GTP (Fig. 6B) concentration. From double-reciprocal plots of the data, we calculated a Km for m7GDP of 65 μm with a kcat of 14 min–1 and a Km for m7GTP of 30 μm with a kcat of 13 min–1. The cap dinucleotide m7GpppA was a more avid methyl acceptor than either m7GDP or m7GTP (Fig. 6C); we calculated a Km of 7 μm m7 GpppA and a kcat of 14 min–1. These experiments show that, whereas the affinity of Tgs2 for the m7G nucleotide methyl acceptor is enhanced 2-fold by the γ-phosphate of m7GTP and an additional 4-fold by the 5′-nucleoside of the cap analog, kcat is unaffected by either the γ-phosphate or the 5′-nucleoside. Characterization of the Reaction Product—The primary structure similarity between Tgs2 and the yeast Tgs1 trimethylguanosine synthase enzymes engenders a prediction that the exocyclic N2 atom of m7G is the methyl acceptor in the Tgs2-catalyzed reaction. Nonetheless, we considered the possibility that Tgs2 might transfer the methyl group to either the ribose or the base of the nucleotide substrate. If methyl transfer occurred at either the ribose O2′ or O3′ atoms of m7GDP, then the resulting 2′-OCH3 or 3′-OCH3 products should be resistant to oxidation by periodate, whereas methylation at guanine-N2 would preserve the vicinal ribose hydroxyls and leave them sensitive to periodate oxidation. Fig. 7 shows that treatment of the 3H-labeled product of Tgs2-catalyzed methyl transfer from AdoMet to m7GDP with sodium periodate caused the labeled nucleotide to be retained at the origin during PEI-cellulose TLC. The untreated product migrated at its usual position, slower than AdoMet and immediately ahead of the m7GDP substrate. Retention at the origin is a consequence of oxidation of the ribose to a ring-opened 2′,3′-dialdehyde, which forms a covalent Schiff base adduct to the PEI at the site of application to the TLC plate. Control experiments showed that periodate treatment of unlabeled GTP quantitatively shifted the nucleotide to the origin, whereas periodate treatment of 3′-OCH3 GTP had no effect on migration during TLC (not shown). We conclude that Tgs2 does not catalyze methylation of the ribose hydroxyls. The labeled product formed by Tgs2 in reactions containing excess m7GDP methyl acceptor comigrated during TLC with the m2,7GDP product synthesized by S. pombe Tgs1 (data not shown). The absence of a 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine product of the Tgs2 reaction implies one of the following possibilities: (i) that Tgs2 is not able to perform the second methylation reaction at N2; or (ii) that Tgs2 does catalyze a second methylation reaction, but we are precluded from detecting it because the enzyme acts distributively, i.e. the labeled m2,7GDP product dissociates after a single round of catalysis and must compete with a large molar excess of unlabeled m7GDP for rebinding to Tgs2. Previous studies showed that S. pombe Tgs1 does catalyze sequential methylation reactions at N2 via a distributive mechanism (6Hausmann S. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4021-4024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To address this issue for the Giardia enzyme, we analyzed the products of a Tgs2 methylation reaction at equal concentrations of the methyl donor and acceptor. As outlined in Fig. 8, Tgs2 was incubated with 50 μm m7GDP and 50 μm [methyl-3H]AdoMet for 30 min, at which time most of the label had been transferred to the substrate to form a single methylated product. The reaction mixture was then split and supplemented with 1 mm cold AdoMet and either S. pombe Tgs1 or fresh Giardia Tgs2. The reactions were continued for another 60 min, and the products were analyzed by TLC. The instructive finding was that about half of the m2,7GDP formed during the pulse-labeling phase was subsequently converted by S. pombe Tgs1 to the slightly more rapidly migrating trimethylated product m2,2.7GDP during the chase in the presence of excess cold AdoMet (Fig. 8). In contrast, adding more Giardia Tgs2 resulted in no change in the radiolabeled product distribution. These results indicate that Tgs2 is a dimethylguanosine synthase capable of catalyzing only one methyl addition reaction at the exocyclic amino nitrogen of m7G. Asp-68, Glu-91, and Trp-143 Are Essential for Tgs2 Methyltransferase Activity—Amino acid sequence comparisons of Tgs-like proteins and structural model building (5Mouaikel J. Bujnicki J.M. Tazi J. Bordonné R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4899-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) led to the prediction of a canonical AdoMet binding site in S. cerevisiae Tgs1 composed of two peptide motifs highlighted in shaded boxes in Fig. 1 (corresponding to Tgs2 peptides 66VIDGTACVGG75 and 88VAIE91). A putative methyl acceptor site was predicted to reside within the conserved proline/glycine containing motif (140DPPWGGV146 in Tgs2; see Fig. 1). Bordonné and colleagues (4Mouaikel J. Verheggen C. Bertrand E. Tazi J. Bordonné R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 5Mouaikel J. Bujnicki J.M. Tazi J. Bordonné R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4899-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have shown that alanine mutations of S. cerevisiae Tgs1 at three conserved positions in these motifs (Asp-103, Asp-126, and Trp-178, corresponding to Asp-68, Glu-91, and Trp-143 in Giardia Tgs2) cause defects in TMG cap formation in vivo. To gauge the biochemical effects of such changes, we produced Giardia Tgs2 mutants D68A, E91A, and W143A in bacteria as His10 fusions and isolated them from soluble bacterial extracts by nickel-agarose chromatography (Fig. 2). We found that the Tgs2 mutants were inert in catalysis of methyl transfer from AdoMet to m7GDP, at a level of sensitivity of ≤1% of the wild-type specific activity (Fig. 2). These results verify that the methyltransferase activity is intrinsic to the recombinant Tgs2 protein. Based on the crystal structure of the cap guanine-N7 methyltransferase Ecm1 bound to AdoMet and on mutational analysis of that enzyme (19Fabrega C. Hausmann S. Shen V. Shuman S. Lima C.D. Mol.

The experiments presented here show that Giardia Tgs2 is a monomeric m7G-specific methyltransferase that catalyzes addition of one methyl group to the exocyclic guanine-N2 atom. The recombinant Giardia enzyme resembles the fission yeast Tgs1 protein in its requirement for prior methylation at guanine-N7 and its ability to methylate m7G mononucleotides and m7G cap dinucleotides in the absence of an RNA polynucleotide or a separate protein cofactor. Tgs2 has a Km for AdoMet (6 μm) similar to that of S. pombe Tgs1 (9 μm) and, like the fission yeast enzyme, Tgs2 is inhibited by its reaction product AdoHcy. Tgs2 displays a higher affinity for m7GDP (Km of 65 μm) than does S. pombe Tgs1 (Km of 570 μm), and the turnover number of Tgs2 (14 min–1) is higher than that of S. pombe Tgs1 (2 min–1). The most distinctive property of Giardia Tgs2 is that its activity is apparently limited to a single round of N2 methylation, resulting in the synthesis of a 2,7-dimethylguanosine product. In contrast, S. pombe Tgs1, the only other cap-specific N2 methyltransferase that has been characterized (6Hausmann S. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4021-4024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), is able to catalyze two sequential N2 methylations leading to TMG cap formation. tRNA-specific guanine-N2 methyltransferases also fall into two classes, depending on whether they catalyze either one methylation step to form 2-methylguanosine (21Purushothaman S.K. Bujnicki J.M. Grosjean H. Lapeyre B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4359-4370Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) or two sequential steps to generate 2,2-dimethylguanosine (22Ellis S.R.

The rRNA-specific guanine-N2 methyltransferase RsmC performs only one methylation step to generate 2-methylguanosine (26Tscherne J.S. Nurse K. Popienick P. Ofengand J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 924-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Given the proposal that that members of the Tgs-like family are structurally homologous to RsmC (5Mouaikel J. Bujnicki J.M. Tazi J. Bordonné R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4899-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and the present biochemical characterization of Giardia Tgs2 as a 2,7-dimethylguanosine synthase, it is appropriate to sound a note of caution in attributing TMG cap synthetic roles to Tgs1-like proteins in the absence of direct evidence that they catalyze two methylation steps. The substrate specificity of Giardia Tgs2 makes it unlikely, in our view, that it plays a role in either tRNA or rRNA modifications, because Tgs2 activity requires prior guanine-N7 methylation, and the affinity of Tgs2 for the methyl acceptor is enhanced when the m7G nucleoside has a5′-triphosphate and a second nucleoside attached in an inverted 5′-5′ orientation; these are signature features of the RNA cap. Taken at face value, our findings concerning Tgs2 suggest that any TMG caps present in Giardia small nuclear RNAs or small nucleolar RNAs are either synthesized by the paralogous protein Tgs1 alone or by the sequential action of Tgs2 and Tgs1. We cannot exclude a more elaborate scenario in which there exists in Giardia a regulatory factor that confers upon Tgs2 the ability to catalyze a second guanine-N2 methylation reaction. The specificity of Tgs2 raises the prospect that some Giardia mRNAs might have dimethylguanosine caps. Note that the mRNAs of two eukaryotic RNA viruses (Sindbis virus and Semliki Forest virus) have been reported to contain a significant fraction of 2,7-dimethyguanosine caps (27HsuChen C.C. Dubin D.T. Nature. 1976; 264: 190-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28Van Duijn L.P. Kasperaitis M. Ameling C. Voorma H.O. Virus Res. 1986; 5: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Whereas indirect assays reveal that Giardia mRNAs contained blocked 5′-terminal structures that are resistant to phosphatase but sensitive to pyrophosphatase (15Hausmann S. Altura M.A. Witmer M. Singer S.M. Elmendorf H.G. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12077-12086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the structure of the blocking nucleoside is unknown. Also, whereas Giardia contains small RNAs that can be recovered using anti-TMG antibody (18Niu X.H. Hartshorne T. He X.Y. Agabian N. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the structures of those caps have not been determined directly. The recent finding that Giardia has two eIF4Es with preferential affinity for m7G and m2,2,7G caps, respectively (17Li L. Wang C.C. Eukaryotic Cell. 2005; 4: 948-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), did not examine whether the TMG-specific eIF4E2 protein might bind as well or better to a 2,7-dimethylguanosine cap. Several independent studies have shown that 2,7-dimethylguanosine (DMG)-capped reporter mRNAs are translated better than standard m7G-capped transcripts in vitro, whereas TMG-capped reporter mRNAs are translated with low efficiency (29Darzynkiewicz E.

In conclusion, the existence of cap-specific N2 methylating enzymes with TMG versus DMG synthase activities raises questions about the structural basis for the different reaction outcomes and the potential existence and function of DMG caps in eukaryotic RNA transactions."

Because the presence of neuroantigen-primed T cells within the CNS is necessary for the development of MS, the present study was undertaken to investigate the activation of microglia by myelin basic protein (MBP)-primed T cells of male, female, and castrated male mice. Interestingly, MBP-primed T cells isolated from female and castrated male but not from male mice induced the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) and proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-1α, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α) in microglia by cell-cell contact. Again there was no apparent defect in male microglia, because MBP-primed T cells isolated from female and castrated male but not male mice were capable of inducing the production of NO in male primary microglia. Inhibition of female T cell contact-mediated microglial expression of proinflammatory molecules by dominant-negative mutants of p65 and C/EBPβ suggest that female MBP-primed T cells induce microglial expression of proinflammatory molecules through the activation of NF-κB and C/EBPβ. Interestingly, MBP-primed T cells of male, female, and castrated male mice were able to induce microglial activation of NF-κB.

These studies suggest that microglial activation of C/EBPβ but not NF-κB by T cell:microglial contact is a gender-specific event and that male MBP-primed T cells are not capable of inducing microglial expression of proinflammatory molecules due to their inability to induce the activation of C/EBPβ in microglia. This novel gender-sensitive activation of microglia by neuroantigen-primed T cell contact could be one of the mechanisms behind the female-loving nature of MS.

It has been known for decades that females are twice as likely as males to be affected from MS (1Duquette P. Pleines J. Girard M. Charest L. Senecal-Quevillon M. Masse C. Can. J. Neurol.

This gender bias is also consistent with many other autoimmune diseases, including Addison, rheumatoid arthritis, pernicious anemia, Sjogren, systemic lupus erythematosus, and thyroiditis, in which women are also preferentially affected (2Jacobson D.L.

Despite extensive research, the molecular mechanism behind this female prevalence is poorly understood. The hallmark of brain inflammation in MS is the activation of glial cells, especially that of microglia that express and produce a variety of proinflammatory and neurotoxic molecules, including inducible nitricoxide synthase (iNOS) and proinflammatory cytokines (8Martin R.

Inhibition of iNOS in both rat and mouse model of EAE by aminoguanidine also prevented the clinical development of EAE (12Brenner T. Brocke S. Szafer F. Sobel R.A. Parkinson J.F. Perez D.H.

Among proinflammatory cytokines, primary inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β/α, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α/β, and IL-6, play a predominant role, because they are involved at multiple levels of neuroimmune regulation (9Benveniste E.N.

Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid from MS patients has shown increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines compared with normal control, and levels of those cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients also correlate with disease severity (9Benveniste E.N.

Consistently, blockade of proinflammatory cytokine synthesis or function by signaling inhibitors or neutralizing antibodies or gene knock-out can also prevent the development of EAE (19Ruddle N.H.

Recently we have observed that neuroantigen-specific T cells induce specifically microglial expression of iNOS and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-1α, TNF-α, and IL-6) through cell-cell contact (22Dasgupta S. Jana M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39327-39333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Dasgupta S. Jana M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol.

Because neuroantigen-specific T cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of MS, to understand the molecular basis of gender difference in MS, we investigated the effect of MBP-primed T cells isolated from female, male, and castrated male mice on contact-mediated activation of microglia. Here we demonstrate that MBP-primed T cells isolated from female and castrated male but not male mice induced the expression of iNOS and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-1α, TNF-α, and IL-6) in microglia by cell-cell contact. Furthermore, we show that MBP-primed T cells isolated from female and castrated male but not male mice were capable of inducing proinflammatory molecules in both male and female microglia suggesting a possible defect in male T cells but not in microglia. Consistent with the involvement of NF-κB and C/EBPβ in the expression of microglial proinflammatory molecules (23Dasgupta S. Jana M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22424-22431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Jana M. Dasgupta S. Saha R.N. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), MBP-primed T cells of female and castrated male mice induced the activation of both NF-κB and C/EBPβ in microglia by cell-cell contact. In contrast, male MBP-primed T cells induced microglial activation of only NF-κB but not C/EBPβ. These results suggest that male MBP-primed T cells are not capable of activating microglia due to their inability to induce the activation of C/EBPβ in microglia. Reagents—Fetal bovine serum, Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), DMEM/F-12, RPMI 1640, L-glutamine, and β-mercaptoethanol were from Mediatech. Assay systems for IL-1β and TNF-α were purchased from BD Pharmingen. Bovine myelin basic protein was purchased from Invitrogen. [α-32P]dCTP and [γ-32P]ATP were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The dominant-negative mutant of C/EBPβ (ΔC/EBPβ) was kindly provided by Dr. Steve Smale of the University of California at Los Angeles. Isolation and Purification of Antigen-primed T Cells—Specific pathogen-free female, male, and castrated male SJL/J mice (4 – 6 weeks old) were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc. MBP-primed T cells were isolated and purified as described earlier (22Dasgupta S. Jana M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol.

Briefly, mice were immunized subcutaneously with 400 μg of bovine MBP and 60 μg Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37RA, Difco Laboratoies) in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) (Calbiochem). Lymph nodes were collected from these mice, and single cell suspension was prepared in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultured at a concentration of 4–5 × 106 cells/ml in six-well plates. Cells isolated from MBP-immunized mice were incubated with 50 μg/ml MBP for 4 days. The non-adherent cells were collected, and T cells were purified through a nylon wool column (22Dasgupta S. Jana M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39327-39333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Viability and purity of the cells were checked by trypan blue exclusion and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, respectively. About 98% of the cells were found as CD3-positive T cells (22Dasgupta S. Jana M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39327-39333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These T cell populations were used to stimulate microglial cells. Isolation of Mouse Primary Microglia—Microglial cells were isolated from mixed glial cultures according to the procedure of Guilian and Baker (25Giulian D. Baker T.J. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2163-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, on days 7–9 the mixed glial cultures were washed three times with DMEM/F-12 and subjected to a shake at 240 rpm for 2 h at 37 °C on a rotary shaker. The floating cells were washed and seeded onto plastic tissue culture flasks and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The attached cells were removed by trypsinization and seeded onto new plates for further studies. 90–95% of this preparation was found to be positive for Mac-1 surface antigen. For the induction of TNF-α production, cells were stimulated with MBP-primed T cells in serum-free DMEM/F-12. Mouse BV-2 microglial cells (kind gift from Virginia Bocchini of University of Perugia) were also maintained and induced with different stimuli as indicated above. Stimulation of Mouse BV-2 Microglial Cells and Primary Microglia by MBP-primed T Cells—Microglial cells were stimulated with different concentrations of MBP-primed T cells under serum-free condition. After1hof incubation, culture dishes were shaken and washed thrice with HBSS to lower the concentration of T cells. Earlier, by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of adherent microglial cells using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-CD3 antibodies, we demonstrated that more than 80% T cells were removed from microglial cells by this procedure (23Dasgupta S. Jana M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22424-22431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Then microglial cells were incubated in serum-free media for different periods of time depending on experiments. Assay for NO Synthesis—Synthesis of NO was determined by assay of culture supernatants for nitrite, a stable reaction product of NO with molecular oxygen. Briefly, supernatants were centrifuged to remove cells, and 400 μl of each supernatant was allowed to react with 200 μlof Griess reagent (26Jana M. Liu X. Koka S. Ghosh S. Petro T.M. Pahan K. J.

The optical density of the assay samples was measured spectrophotometrically at 570 nm. Fresh culture media served as the blank. Nitrite concentrations were calculated from a standard curve derived from the reaction of NaNO2 in the assay. Immunoblot Analysis for iNOS—Immunoblot analysis for iNOS was carried out as described earlier (26Jana M. Liu X. Koka S. Ghosh S. Petro T.M. Pahan K. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were detached by scraping, washed with Hank's buffer, and homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). After electrophoresis the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and the iNOS band was visualized by immunoblotting with antibodies against mouse macrophage iNOS and 125I-labeled protein A (26Jana M.

RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Cells were taken out of the culture dishes directly by adding Ultraspec-II RNA reagent (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc.), and total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's protocol. For Northern blot analyses, 20 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on 1.2% denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels, electrotransferred to Hybond nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized at 68 °C with 32P-labeled cDNA probe using Express Hyb hybridization solution (Clontech) as described by the manufacturer. The cDNA probe was made by polymerase chain reaction amplification using two primers (forward primer: 5′-CTC CTT CAA AGA GGC AAA AAT A-3′; reverse primer: 5′-CAC TTC CTC CAG GAT GTT GT-3′) (26Jana M.

After hybridization, the filters were washed two or three times in solution I (2 × SSC, 0.05% SDS) for 1 h at room temperature followed by solution II (0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 50 °C for another hour. The membranes were then dried and exposed to x-ray films (Kodak). The same amount of RNA was hybridized with probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Assay for IL-1β and TNF-α Synthesis—Concentrations of IL-1β and TNF-α were measured in culture supernatants by a high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BD Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's instruction as described earlier (23Dasgupta S.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Analysis of Different Proinflammatory and Anti-inflammatory Cytokines by Gene Array—BV-2 microglial cells were stimulated with MBP-primed T cells (0.5:1 of T cell:microglia), and after 1 h of stimulation, culture dishes were shaken and washed thrice with HBSS to lower T cell concentration. Then BV-2 cells received serum-free media, and after 3 h of incubation, expression of different proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines was analyzed in adherent BV-2 cells by a gene array kit (GEArray™) from SuperArray, Inc. following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, total RNA was isolated from stimulated or unstimulated BV-2 microglial cells by using Ultraspec-II RNA reagent (Biotecx Laboratories Inc.). This RNA was used as a template for [32P]cDNA probe synthesis using [α-32P]dCTP and Moloney Murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. The GEArray membrane was prehybridized, hybridized with [32P]cDNA probe, and washed two or three times in solution I (2 × SSC, 0.05% SDS) for1hat room temperature followed by solution II (0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 50 °C for another hour. The membranes were then dried and exposed to x-ray films (Kodak). Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—After different minutes of stimulation of BV-2 microglial cells by MBP-primed T cells, culture dishes were shaken and washed thrice with HBSS to lower T cell concentration. Then nuclear extracts were prepared from adherent BV-2 cells using the method of Dignam et al. (30Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Cells were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 15 min on ice, vortexed vigorously for 15 s, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 s. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 40 μl of buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). After 30 min on ice, lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants containing the nuclear proteins were diluted with 20 μl of modified buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm PMSF) and stored at 70 °C until use. Nuclear extracts were used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay using 32P end-labeled double-stranded (NF-kB, 5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′ (Promega) and C/EBPβ, 5′-TGC AGA TTG CGC AAT CTG CA-3′ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.)) oligonucleotides. Double-stranded mutated (NF-κB, 5′-AGT TGA GGC GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′, and C/EBPβ, 5′-TGC AGA GAC TAG TCT CTG CA-3′ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.)) oligonucleotides were used to verify the specificity of NF-κB and C/EBPβ binding to DNA. Assay of Transcriptional Activities of NF-κB and C/EBPβ—To assay the transcriptional activity of NF-κB and C/EBPβ, cells at 50 – 60% confluence in 12-well plates were transfected with 0.5 μg of either PBIIX-Luc, an NF-κB-dependent reporter construct (26Jana M.

All transfections included 50 ng/μg total DNA of pRL-TK (a plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase, used as transfection efficiency control, Promega). After 24 h of transfection, cells were stimulated with MBP-primed T cells (0.5:1 of T cell: microglia). After 1 h of stimulation, culture dishes were shaken and washed thrice with HBSS to lower T cell concentration. Then BV-2 cells were incubated with serum-free media for 5 h. Adherent BV-2 cells were analyzed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activities according to standard instructions provided in the Dual Luciferase Kit (Promega) in a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). Relative luciferase activity of cell extracts was typically represented as (firefly luciferase value/Renilla luciferase value) × 10–3. MBP-primed T Cells Isolated from Female but Not Male SJL/J Mice Induced the Expression of iNOS in BV-2 Microglial Cells—Earlier we have observed that MBP-primed T cells from female SJL/J mice induce the expression of iNOS in microglia by cell-cell contact (22Dasgupta S. Jana M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39327-39333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) suggesting that neuroantigen-primed T cell contact-mediated microglial expression of iNOS may participate in the pathogenesis of MS. As females are more susceptible to MS than males, to understand the molecular basis of gender difference in MS, we investigated the effect of MBP-primed T cells isolated from female and male SJL/J mice on contact-mediated expression of iNOS in microglia. T cells isolated from MBP-immunized female and male SJL/J mice proliferated in response to MBP, and the maximum proliferation was observed at 50 or 100 μg/ml of MBP (data not shown). Therefore, these cells were stimulated with 50 μg/ml MBP, and after nylon-wool column purification, MBP-primed T cells were washed and added to BV-2 microglial cells in direct contact (22Dasgupta S. Jana M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39327-39333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Dasgupta S. Jana M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22424-22431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). After 1 h of contact, culture dishes were shaken and washed thrice to remove MBP-primed T cells. In an earlier study (23Dasgupta S. Jana M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22424-22431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we observed, by using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of adherent microglial cells using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-CD3 antibodies, that >80% T cells were removed from microglial cells by this procedure. As observed earlier (22Dasgupta S. Jana M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39327-39333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), female MBP-primed T cells markedly induced the production of NO in BV-2 microglial cells (Fig. 1A). The induction of NO production started from the ratio of 0.2:1 of T cell:microglia, reached to the maximum at the ratio of 0.7:1, and decreased at higher concentrations of T cells (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, MBP-primed T cells from male SJL/J mice were unable to induce the production of NO in BV-2 microglial cells under same condition (Fig. 1A) suggesting the possible involvement of male sex hormone in disabling male MBP-primed T cells from contact-mediated activation of microglia. To further confirm this hypothesis, we isolated MBP-primed T cells from castrated male mice. Similar to female MBP-primed T cells, MBP-primed T cells from castrated male SJL/J mice induced the production of NO in BV-2 microglial cells exhibiting the maximum NO production at the ratio of 0.7:1 of T cell:glia (Fig. 1A). To understand further the mechanism of NO production, we examined the effect of male, female, and castrated male MBP-primed T cells on protein and mRNA levels of iNOS. Western blot analysis with antibodies against murine macrophage iNOS and Northern blot analysis for iNOS mRNA clearly showed that MBP-primed T cells of female and castrated male were capable of inducing the expression of iNOS protein (Fig. 2A) and iNOS mRNA (Fig. 2B). Consistent to the induction of NO production, MBP-primed T cells did not induce the expression of iNOS protein and mRNA in BV-2 microglial cells when added at a ratio of 0.1:1. The induction of iNOS protein and mRNA by female and castrated male MBP-primed T cells started at the ratio of 0.2:1 of T cell: microglia and peaked at the ratio of 0.7:1 (Fig. 2). However, under the same condition, male MBP-primed T cells were unable to induce the expression of iNOS protein and mRNA at different concentrations of T cell:microglia (Fig. 2). MBP-primed T Cells Isolated from Female and Castrated Male but Not Male SJL/J Mice Induced the Production of NO in Mouse Primary Microglia—To understand if MBP-primed T cells isolated from female and castrated male but not male mice also induced the production of NO in primary cells, we examined the effect of these T cells on the production of NO in mouse primary microglia."
https://openalex.org/W1979159143,"To elucidate the molecular mechanisms for the enhancement of heat-induced apoptosis on exposure to acidic conditions, human maxillary carcinoma IMC-3 cells were heat-shocked at 44°C for 30 min at either pH 7.4 or 6.7. Analyses with cDNA arrays, the reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR), and Western blotting were performed. We found that histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) was specifically induced after hyperthermia at 44°C for 30 min at pH 6.7. Although the cytotoxicity of heating at 44°C for 30 min was enhanced by decreasing the pH from 7.4 to 6.7, it was enhanced even more by antisense RNA oligonucleotides for HDAC3. The induction of G2/M arrest after heating occurred earlier at pH 6.7 than at pH 7.4. The inhibition of HDAC3 by the antisense RNA oligonucleotides suppressed partially the induction of G2/M arrest, resulting in an enhancement of the apoptosis caused by the heating under acidic conditions. Antisense RNA oligonucleotides for HDAC3 enhanced apoptosis 48 h after hyperthermia at 43°C for 30 min in vivo. Analyses of p65 activity suggested that NF-κB is involved in this enhancement of hyperthermia. HDAC3 may be a novel target enhancing hyperthermia and combined treatment with hyperthermia and HDAC inhibitors is a possible modality for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1996165325,"All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) significantly improves the survival of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) by inducing granulocytic differentiation of leukemia cells. Since an activation of the transcription factor NF-κB occurs during ATRA-induced maturation of APL cells, a mechanistic link between these two processes was investigated. Using an in vitro model for APL, we report that ectopic overexpression of a repressor of NF-κB activation did not affect granulocytic differentiation. Importantly, NF-κB inhibition markedly resulted in a decreased viability of the differentiated cells, which correlated with increased apoptosis. Apoptosis was accompanied by a sustained activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Inhibition of JNK by the specific inhibitor SP600125 or by transfection of a dominant-negative mutant of JNK1 reduced the percentage of apoptotic cells, thus showing that JNK activation constitutes a death signal. Furthermore, impairment of NF-κB activation resulted in increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon ATRA treatment. ROS accumulation was suppressed by the antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisol, which also abolished ATRA-induced JNK activation and apoptosis. Altogether, our results demonstrate an antiapoptotic effect of NF-κB activation during ATRA-induced differentiation of NB4 cells and identify repression of ROS-mediated JNK activation as a mechanism for this effect. Our observations also suggest that NF-κB signalling may contribute to an accumulation of mature APL cells and participate in the development of ATRA syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1989939397,"Apoptosis of pancreatic β cells is implicated in the onset of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Consequently, strategies aimed at increasing the resistance of β cells toward apoptosis could be beneficial in the treatment of diabetes. RasGAP, a regulator of Ras and Rho GTPases, is an atypical caspase substrate, since it inhibits, rather than favors, apoptosis when it is partially cleaved by caspase-3 at position 455. The antiapoptotic signal generated by the partial processing of RasGAP is mediated by the N-terminal fragment (fragment N) in a Ras-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt-dependent, but NF-κB-independent, manner. Further cleavage of fragment N at position 157 abrogates its antiapoptotic properties. Here we demonstrate that an uncleavable form of fragment N activates Akt, represses NF-κB activity, and protects the conditionally immortalized pancreatic insulinoma βTC-tet cell line against various insults, including exposure to genotoxins, trophic support withdrawal, and incubation with inflammatory cytokines. Fragment N also induced Akt activity and protection against cytokine-induced apoptosis in primary pancreatic islet cells. Fragment N did not alter insulin cell content and insulin secretion in response to glucose. These data indicate that fragment N protects β cells without affecting their function. The pathways regulated by fragment N are therefore promising targets for antidiabetogenic therapy. Apoptosis of pancreatic β cells is implicated in the onset of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Fragment N did not alter insulin cell content and insulin secretion in response to glucose. These data indicate that fragment N protects β cells without affecting their function. The pathways regulated by fragment N are therefore promising targets for antidiabetogenic therapy. Apoptosis appears to be a critical determinant in the development of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is a direct consequence of an autoimmune attack on pancreatic islet β-cells leading to their death (1Mauricio D. Mandrup-Poulsen T. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1537-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Analyses of pancreatic tissues from deceased human subjects has indicated that β cell mass is decreased in type 2 diabetes as well and that the mechanism underlying this is an increase in β cell apoptosis (2Butler A.E. Janson J. Bonner-Weir S. Ritzel R. Rizza R.A. Butler P.C. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar). The higher apoptotic rate observed in β cells of diabetic patients could result from deregulated levels of various circulating fuel molecules (e.g. glucose and saturated fatty acids) and chronic activation of the innate immune system (3Donath M.Y. Storling J. Maedler K. Mandrup-Poulsen T. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 455-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is induced when members of the caspase family of proteases are activated. These enzymes cleave a subset of cellular proteins (4Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 5Fischer U. Janicke R.U. Schulze-Osthoff K. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 76-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar), inducing the characteristic biochemical and morphological features of apoptosis. Cells can activate a series of regulatory mechanisms to maintain an adequate balance between pro- and antiapoptotic signals. For example, the ratio of proapoptotic versus anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members can determine whether or not a cell survives (6Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4023) Google Scholar). Many intracellular signaling pathways also regulate cell death (7Jarpe M.B. Widmann C. Knall C. Schlesinger T.K. Gibson S. Yujiri T. Fanger G.R. Gelfand E.G. Johnson G.L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, the activation of a given intracellular signaling pathway does not necessarily generate the same response in different cell types. For example, activation of NF-κB is protective in fibroblasts and T cells (8Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar, 9Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar) but favors cells death in pancreatic β cells (10Baker M.S. Chen X. Cao X.C. Kaufman D.B. J. Surg. Res. 2001; 97: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11Giannoukakis N. Rudert W.A. Trucco M. Robbins P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36509-36513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The cellular context will probably modulate the way a given signaling pathway in a given cell type regulates apoptosis. RasGAP, a regulator of Ras and Rho, is a caspase-3 substrate that functions as a sensor of caspase-3 activity in cells (12Yang J.-Y. Michod D. Walicki J. Widmann C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 1027-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). RasGAP is cleaved in a stepwise manner as caspase activity increases. At low caspase-3 activity, RasGAP is cleaved only once at position 455, generating an N-terminal fragment, called fragment N, that induces a potent antiapoptotic Ras-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt-dependent pathway (13Yang J.-Y. Widmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5346-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 14Yang J.-Y. Widmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14641-14646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This protective pathway occurs independently of NF-κB activation, since fragment N inhibits the ability of Akt to stimulate the NF-κB pathway (14Yang J.-Y. Widmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14641-14646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Generation of fragment N is crucial for cell survival in low stress conditions (15Yang J.-Y. Michod D. Walicki J. Murphy B.M. Kasibhatla S. Martin S. Widmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10425-10436Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). At higher caspase activity, fragment N is further processed into two additional fragments, called fragments N1 and N2. Cleavage of fragment N abrogates its protective functions, and hence the second cleavage of RasGAP promotes apoptosis (24Yang J.Y. Walicki J. Michod D. Dubuis G. Widmann C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3511-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Pancreatic β cells undergo apoptosis in response to a variety of stimuli, including nutrient deprivation and inflammatory cytokines. Counteracting the proapoptotic effects of caspases would therefore be advantageous to render β cells more resistant to a series of noxious stimuli. To determine whether fragment N has a beneficial function in insulin-secreting cells, we have assessed here whether an uncleavable form of this fragment renders the conditionally immortalized pancreatic insulinoma βTC-tet cell line more resistant to a series of adverse stimuli. We also compared the protection efficacy of fragment N with that of another antiapoptotic protein, Bcl-2, which has been shown to induce survival signals in β cells (16Dupraz P. Rinsch C. Pralong W.F. Rolland E. Zufferey R. Trono D. Thorens B. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1160-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) but does not activate the Ras-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway and therefore protects cells differently from fragment N (6Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4023) Google Scholar, 17Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3225-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Finally, we have determined whether the combined expression of fragment N and Bcl-2 provides additive levels of protection in β cells. Plasmids—HA-D157A.dn3 encodes a RasGAP mutant that cannot be cleaved at position 157. Two plasmids bearing the uncleavable form of fragment N have been used for the production of fragment N-encoding lentivirus. The first one, N-D157A.lti, bears the fragment N cDNA under the control of the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter and has been described earlier (15Yang J.-Y. Michod D. Walicki J. Murphy B.M. Kasibhatla S. Martin S. Widmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10425-10436Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The second one, N-D157A.irs, has been generated by subcloning the BamHI-XhoI fragment of N-D157A.dn3 (14Yang J.-Y. Widmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14641-14646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) in TRIP-PGK-IRESNEO-WHV opened with BamHI and SalI. This plasmid bears the neomycin resistance gene and the fragment N cDNA separated by an internal ribosomal entry site under the control of the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter. The plasmid used for the generation of Bcl-2-encoding lentivirus (SIN-PGK-hBcl-2-WHV) has been described previously (16Dupraz P. Rinsch C. Pralong W.F. Rolland E. Zufferey R. Trono D. Thorens B. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1160-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding the dominant negative kinase-dead mutant of Akt (HA-Akt1(K179M).cmv; previously called Akt-DN.cmv) has been described earlier (14Yang J.-Y. Widmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14641-14646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Lentivirus—Recombinant lentiviruses were produced as described (18Dull T. Zufferey R. Kelly M. Mandel R.J. Nguyen M. Trono D. Naldini L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8463-8471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were co-transfected using the calcium phosphate DNA precipitation method (19Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) with 10 μg of the lentiviral vector containing the cDNA of interest (e.g. N-D157A.lti), 2.5 μg of the envelope protein-coding plasmid (pMD.G), and 7.5 μg of the packaging construct (pCMVDR8.91). Two days after the transfection, the virus-containing medium was harvested. To determine how much of the virus preparations was needed to infect 100% of the cells, βTC-tet and βTC-tet/Bcl-2 seeded at a 50% confluence on coverslips placed in 6-well plates were cultured overnight with various volumes of fragment N-encoding lentiviruses. After removal of the virus solution, the cells were maintained for 2 more days before fixation and immunocytochemical staining with antibodies directed at the HA tag. The lowest volumes of the lentiviral preparations required to infect 100% of the cells were chosen for further experiments. Cell Lines—βTC-tet and βTC-tet/Bcl-2 cells (16Dupraz P. Rinsch C. Pralong W.F. Rolland E. Zufferey R. Trono D. Thorens B. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1160-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (catalog number D-5671; Sigma) containing 15% decomplemented horse serum (catalog number H-1270; Sigma), 2.5% fetal calf serum (catalog number F-7524; Sigma), 10 mm HEPES (catalog number H-3537; Sigma), 2 mml-glutamine (catalog number G-7513; Sigma), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (catalog number S-8636; Sigma) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Generation of fragment N-producing cell lines was obtained following infection with fragment N-encoding viruses in conditions leading to 100% infection efficiency (see “Lentivirus”). Generation of control cell lines was performed using empty lentiviruses using the same volume loads as when cells were infected with fragment N-encoding viruses. When viruses constructed with plasmids derived from the TRIP-PGK-IRESNEO-WHV vector were used (e.g. N-D157A.irs), a selection step with 1 mg/ml neomycin for 14 days was additionally performed. Growth arrest of the βTC-tet and their derivatives was achieved by incubating the cells for 4 days with 1 μg/ml tetracycline (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) (16Dupraz P. Rinsch C. Pralong W.F. Rolland E. Zufferey R. Trono D. Thorens B. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1160-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This represses the expression of the large T antigen and prevents the cells from proliferating (20Fleischer N. Chen C. Surana M. Leiser M. Rossetti L. Pralong W. Efrat S.

Chemicals and Antibodies—The anti-phosphoserine 473-Akt rabbit polyclonal IgG antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology (catalog number 9271). The rabbit polyclonal IgG antibody recognizing Akt1/2 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) (catalog number SC-8312). The anti-RasGAP antibody is directed at the Src homology domains of RasGAP and has been described before (21Valius M. Secrist J. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3058-3071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-Bcl-2 antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (catalog number 05 341). Cisplatin was from Sigma (catalog number P4394). Cytokines (TNFα, 2The abbreviations used are: TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution. interleukin-1β, and interferon-γ) were from ALEXIS (catalog number ALX-520-002-C010, ALX-520-001-C010, and PBL-11500-2, respectively). The antibody directed at the SV40 large T antigen was from BD Biosciences (catalog number 55414). Apoptosis Assay—The percentage of apoptosis was determined by scoring cells displaying pycnotic nuclei (visualized with Hoechst 33342) (13Yang J.-Y. Widmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5346-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Apoptosis scoring of primary islets cells was performed after dissociating the agglomerated cells in 300 μl of cell dissociation PBS-based buffer (catalog number 13151-014; Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 10–15 min. The cells were then washed once in PBS before being resuspended in 100 μl of PBS containing 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342. Scoring of apoptosis was performed on 20 μl of the stained cells deposited on slides and covered with coverslips. NF-κB Activity Assay—Cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of the NF-κB reporter plasmid prLUC (22Bonvin C. Guillon A. van Bemmelen M.X. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Widmann C. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and 0.5 μg of pRL-TK encoding the Renilla luciferase (Promega) used as an internal control. One day following transfection, the cells were lysed in “passive lysis buffer” (Promega kit number E1910). Measurement of the NF-κB activation was then performed with a Promega kit (catalog number E1910) using lysates (25 μg of protein) according to the manufacturer's protocol (available on the World Wide Web at www.promega.com/tbs/tm040/tm040.pdf). The activity of the NF-κB reporter plasmid was normalized to the activity of the internal control. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in monoQ-c buffer (13Yang J.-Y. Widmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5346-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) in which 1 mm Na3VO4 was freshly added. Western blotting was performed as described previously (23Widmann C. Dolci W. Thorens B. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 24Yang J.Y. Walicki J. Michod D. Dubuis G. Widmann C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3511-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) using a homemade ECL reagent (13Yang J.-Y. Widmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5346-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry—The functional infectivity of the virus preparations was determined by immunocytochemistry. Subconfluent βTC-tet or CDM3D cells seeded on coverslips in 6-well plates were cultured overnight with various volumes of fragment N-encoding recombinant virus. After removal of the virus solution, the cells were maintained in culture for an additional 2 days. The next steps were performed at room temperature. The cells on coverslips were washed with 4 ml of PBS; fixed with 3 ml of PBS, 3% formaldehyde, 3% sucrose for 20 min; washed three times with PBS; incubated with 2 ml of PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min; washed once with PBS; and incubated 15 min at room temperature with 3 ml of filtered serum-containing culture medium. The cells were then incubated 30 min in this medium in the presence of a 1:50 dilution of an anti-HA antibody prepared as described (13Yang J.-Y. Widmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5346-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). After three washes with 4 ml of PBS, the cells were incubated as above with an anti-mouse Cy3-labeled antibody (catalog number 715-165-151; Jackson ImmunoResearch) at a 1:500 dilution. After three more washes over a period of 60 min, the coverslips were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (catalog number H-1000; Vector Laboratories, Ltd.) and visualized with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 imaging microscope equipped with a Plan-Neofluar ×40/01.3 oil ∞/0.17 lens and a Zeiss AxioCam HRC camera using the Zeiss AxioVision acquisition software. Giemsa Staining—The cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 200 cells/well. After 2 weeks, the colonies were stained as follows. The wells were washed with 5 ml of PBS and air-dried. The wells were then incubated for 15 min with ethanol and air-dried again and then incubated for 15 min with 4 ml of a Giemsa stain solution (Giemsa blood stain solution; J.T. Baker Inc.) diluted 1:5 in methanol. The stain solution was then aspirated, and the plates were placed upside down on water for at least 20 min. The plates were finally extensively washed with tap water and air-dried. Colonies were counted with a Bio-Rad Fluor-S MultiImager using the Personal Molecular Imager FX colonies counting program. Cell Counting—Cells in 6-well plates (200 cells/well) were trypsinized for 3 min in 500 μl of 1× trypsin-EDTA solution (catalog number T3924; Sigma), followed by the addition of 500 μl of culture medium. The cells were then harvested, centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min, and resuspended in 100 μl of culture medium in the presence of 10 μl of trypan blue solution (0.4%) (catalog number T8154; Sigma). Living cells excluding the dye were scored using a Neubauer improved counting chamber (Blue Brand, catalog number MAR-0610710). Insulin Quantitation—Cells were extracted with acid/ethanol (lysis in 400 μl of 75% ethanol, 1.5% concentrated hydrochloric acid for 24 h at 4 °C followed by a centrifugation at 700 × g for 3 min). Insulin content of the cell extracts was assessed using a Linco enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Linco; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit, catalog numbers EZRMI-13K and E6013). Insulin Secretion Assays—Growth-arrested cells were washed three times with a modified Krebs-Ringer/bicarbonate-HEPES buffer (140 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 2mm NaHCO3, 10mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) and preincubated with Krebs-Ringer/bicarbonate-HEPES buffer containing 2 mm glucose for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then incubated for 35 min in Krebs-Ringer/bicarbonate-HEPES buffer, 2 mm glucose (basal response), or Krebs-Ringer/bicarbonate-HEPES buffer, 20 mm glucose, 10 μm forskolin (catalog number F-6886; Sigma), 100 μm isobutylmethylxanthine (catalog number I-7018; Sigma) (stimulated response). The supernatant was harvested for the measurement of secreted insulin, and the remaining cells were extracted with acid/ethanol for the measurement of the cellular insulin content, as described above. Preparation of Rat and Mouse Islets—Wistar rats (200–350 g) were killed in a CO2 atmosphere for 4 min. The abdominal cavity was then exposed, and the proximal common bile duct was occluded with a Silkan thread (BBraun, Sempach, Switzerland, catalog number 01134027). A 18-gauge butterfly needle was then inserted in the ampulla of Vater, tied with Silkan thread. Through the needle, 10 ml of ice-cold collagenase (catalog number 11 213 865 001; Roche Applied Science) solution (1 mg/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS)-Hepes/glucose buffer (140 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm KCl, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 0.8 mm MgSO4·7H2O, 1.3 mm CaCl·2H2O, 2mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2) was injected. The pancreas was surgically removed and placed in 10 ml of ice-cold collagenase solution and then transferred to a 37 °C water bath for 38 min. During this period, the sample was vortexed four times. Forty ml of ice-cold HBSS-Hepes/glucose buffer containing 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (isolation buffer) was then added, and the sample was centrifuged at 65 × g for 10 s. The next steps were all performed on ice. Part of the supernatant was aspirated so as to leave about 20 ml in the tube. The digested pancreas was then homogenized by six passages through a blunt 5-gauge needle. Twenty ml of isolation buffer was added and centrifuged at 65 × g for 10 s. Part of the supernatant was discarded (about 20 ml), and the remaining solution passed through the 5-gauge needle twice, complemented with 20 ml of isolation buffer and centrifuged as described above. Twenty ml of the supernatant was again discarded, and the remaining solution was filtered through two layers of sterile gaze. The filter was washed twice with 10 ml of isolation buffer. The collected solution was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 s. The supernatant was discarded so as to leave about 5 ml in the tube. The sample was more tightly packed by a 10-s centrifugation at 400 × g. The supernatant was decanted, the pellet was gently resuspended in 20 ml of Histopaque 1077 solution (catalog number 10771; Sigma), layered carefully on 20 ml of isolation buffer, and spun in a Sigma 4K15 centrifuge at 1100 × g for 15 min (with setting 0 for the acceleration and the deceleration). The lower islet-containing phase (but not the pellet) was then harvested with a Pasteur pipette, and isolation buffer was added up to 40 ml. The sample was spun in a Sigma 4K15 centrifuge at 450 × g for 1 min (with setting 3 for the acceleration and the deceleration). The supernatant was discarded so as to leave about 5 ml in the tube, and isolation buffer was added up to 40 ml. The sample was then spun in a Sigma 4K15 centrifuge at 65 × g for 30 s (with setting 0 for the acceleration and the deceleration). The islets were washed once with 40 ml RPMI (catalog number 31870-025; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 (catalog number H3537; Sigma), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (catalog number S8636; Sigma), 2 mm glutamine (catalog number G7513; Sigma), 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol (catalog number 31350-010; Invitrogen), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (catalog number P0781; Sigma) and centrifuged as above. The supernatant was discarded so as to leave about 5 ml in the tube. The islets were then transferred to a 3-cm Petri dish, hand-picked (∼500 islets/rat), and placed in a new 3-cm Petri dish. This procedure was repeated (5–10 times) until the majority of the exocrine cells was eliminated. Dissociation of the islets was performed as follows. The islets were washed with 1 ml of HBSS-Hepes containing 1 mm EGTA and 5 mm glucose, resuspended in 300 μl of the same buffer, and incubated at 37 °C for 3 min. The islets were then pipetted up and down until loosely dissociated. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of supplemented RPMI. The islets were washed again with 1 ml of supplemented RPMI, resuspended in the same medium at a concentration of about 20 islets/ml before being placed in 6-well plates (2 ml/well). Mice islets were prepared in a similar manner as described for the rat islets with the following differences. Two ml of collagenase solution was injected through a 30-gauge needle, and the pancreas was transferred to 2 ml of the collagenase solution. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 30 ml of ice-cold HBSS-Hepes, centrifuged for 2 min at 400 × g at 4 °C, and washed three times with 40 ml of HBSS-Hepes, and the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of HBSS-Hepes. Following filtration through the gaze, the islets were not layered on Histopaque but were directly resuspended in 10 ml of supplemented RPMI and hand-picked and dissociated as described above. Generation of Fragment N-expressing Lentiviruses—Fragment N can be cleaved, and its antiapoptotic properties abrogated, when caspase activity increases in cells (12Yang J.-Y. Michod D. Walicki J. Widmann C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 1027-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Fragment N cleavage can be prevented by introducing a point mutation in the caspase-3 recognition site at position 157 (13Yang J.-Y. Widmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5346-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 14Yang J.-Y. Widmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14641-14646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this study, the terminology “fragment N” refers to the uncleavable form. Fragment N was introduced in βTC-tet cells, expressing or not expressing Bcl-2 as a result of lentiviral infection (16Dupraz P. Rinsch C. Pralong W.F. Rolland E. Zufferey R. Trono D. Thorens B. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1160-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), using two different types of fragment N-encoding lentiviruses. The first type expresses fragment N but no selection marker, whereas the second type bears a polycistron composed of fragment N followed by the neomycin resistance gene. Fig. 1 shows that both types of viruses induced the production of fragment N in cells. The levels of fragment N expression were, however, lower in cells infected with the neomycin resistance-encoding viruses compared with the cells infected with the other virus (Fig. 1). The two types of viruses provide, therefore, the opportunity to study the effect of high and low expression levels of fragment N on β cell survival. Fragment N has been shown to induce Akt activity and repression of the NF-κB pathway in HeLa cells (14Yang J.-Y. Widmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14641-14646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that expression of fragment N in βTC-tet cells, whether or not they express Bcl-2, also led to Akt activation coupled with a reduction of basal NF-κB activity. There is therefore no difference in the way fragment N regulates Akt and NF-κB in the different cell types tested so far. Fragment N Increases the Resistance of β Cells toward Various Stresses—We first determined the sensitivity of βTC-tet cells to cisplatin, a genotoxic compound inducing apoptosis in many cell types, in the presence or absence of fragment N. βTC-tet cells infected with empty viruses were as sensitive as control cells toward cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3A). In contrast, a 4 times higher cisplatin concentration was required to kill the cells infected with fragment N-encoding viruses compared with control cells or cells infected with empty viruses (Fig. 3A). Cells infected with the fragment N-encoding virus bearing no selection marker were slightly more resistant toward cisplatin compared with cells infected with fragment N-encoding virus bearing the neomycin-resistant gene (Fig. 3A). This is probably due to the lower expression of fragment N in the former cells compared with the latter (Fig. 1). We next assessed whether the protective effect of fragment N could synergize with those of Bcl-2, another antiapoptotic molecule that has been shown to increase the resistance of βTC-tet toward hypoxia- and cytokine-induced apoptosis (16Dupraz P. Rinsch C. Pralong W.F. Rolland E. Zufferey R. Trono D. Thorens B. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1160-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). As expected, the presence of Bcl-2 rendered βTC-tet cells about 2.5 times less sensitive to cisplatin-mediated cell death (compare the EC50 of the red lines in Fig. 3B). The Bcl-2-expressing cells could be rendered 4 times more resistant toward cisplatin in the presence of fragment N (Fig. 3B, right). Therefore, the combined presence of Bcl-2 and fragment N rendered βTC-tet cells 10 times more resistant to cisplatin. We next determined the capacity of βTC-tet cells to cope with cell crowding as a means to assess their resistance toward a degradation of their trophic and growth conditions. Control βTC-tet cells grew more or less exponentially up to 7–8 days, and their population collapsed thereafter within the following 3 days (Fig. 4). The presence of Bcl-2 slightly delayed the collapse of the culture by 1–2 days. In contrast, cells expressing high or low levels of fragment N (i.e. cells derived after infections with non-neomycin-encoding versus neomycin-encoding viruses (see Fig. 1)) appeared to grow faster and collapsed 2–3 days later and at cell densities that were 2–4 times higher compared with control cells. These results indicate that the presence of fragment N allows cells to grow and survive longer in degraded environments. To assess the resistance of βTC-tet cells to an inflammatory environment, βTC-tet cells were incubated with a mixture of inflammatory cytokines. Noninfected cells or cells infected with empty viruses encoding or not encoding the neomycin resistance gene displayed a ∼3-fold increase in the apoptotic rate in response to the cytokine mixture (Fig. 5A). In contrast, when the cells were infected with either type of viruses encoding fragment N, the cytokines only increased apoptosis by 1.5–1.6-fold. The presence of Bcl-2 did not protect cells from apoptosis in response to the concentrations of cytokines used here. Akt activity was required for the protection conferred by fragment N, because a dominant negative mutant of Akt prevented fragment N from inhibiting cytokine-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5B). It could be argued that fragment N may only confer a temporary protection (such as the one seen in Fig. 5A) but no long term survival advantage. To assess this point, βTC-tet and βTC-tet/Bcl-2 cells expressing or not expressing fragment N were placed in Petri dishes and allowed to grow for about 2 weeks in the absence or in the continuous presence of inflammatory cytokines. As shown in Fig. 6, the presence of inflammatory cytokines diminished the ability of βTC-tet to form colonies by a factor of about 10 regardless of whether or not the cells expressed Bcl-2. In contrast, inflammatory cytokines diminished the capacity to form colonies by less than 2-fold in βTC-tet cells expressing fragment N. The co-expression of fragment N with Bcl-2 did not appear to further increase the capacity of βTC-tet cells to generate colonies (Fig. 6). Altogether, these results demonstrate that fragment N confers long term protection against the proapoptotic actions of inflammatory cytokines when other antiapoptotic proteins (e.g. Bcl-2) cannot. The βTC-tet cells express the large T antigen, allowing them to proliferate. Although it has been recently demonstrated that differentiated β cells have the capacity to proliferate to compensate for a loss in β cell mass (25Dor Y. Brown J. Martinez O.I. Melton D.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1906) Google Scholar), mature β cells probably have a low proliferation activity. βTC-tet cells can be growth-arrested by repressing the expression of the large T antigen with tetracycline (Fig. 7A) and in this state can secrete insulin with a normal glucose dose dependence (20Fleischer N. Chen C. Surana M. Leiser M. Rossetti L. Pralong W. Efrat S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1419-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether fragment N would also protect βTC-tet when growth-arrested. As shown in Fig. 7B, the presence of fragment N protected growth-arrested βTC-tet cells as efficiently as it did in proliferating βTC-tet cells. Importantly, the presence of fragment N altered neither the insulin content of the cells (Fig. 7C) nor their ability to secrete insulin in response to increased glucose concentrations (Fig. 7D). Altogether, these results indicate that fragment N potently protects β cells from a variety of stress and noxious stimuli without interfering with their insulin secretion capacity. Fragment N Protects Primary Islet Cells from Cytokine-induced Death—To determine whether fragment N also mediates protection in primary islet cells, mouse and rat islets of Langerhans were isolated, dissociated, infected with empty lentiviruses or virus encoding fragment N, and then incubated or not with inflammatory cytokines. Fig. 8 shows that fragment N potently protected islet cells from both species from cytokine-induced apoptosis (Fig. 8A) and that this correlated with increased levels of phosphorylation of Akt at its activation sites (Fig. 8B). These results indicate that fragment N activates Akt and promotes survival in both transformed and primary β cells. Elimination of pancreatic β cells by apoptosis is a culminating event leading to diabetes. The development of tools favoring β cell survival in patients is therefore of critical importance to delay or prevent the development of the disease (26Shapiro A.M. Nanji S.A. Lakey J.R. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 196: 219-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Moreover, compounds that increase β cell survival would be extremely useful in islet transplantation procedures, such as the Edmonton protocol, to increase the yield of islet cell production from diseased donors and to ameliorate the rate of successful engraftment of the pancreatic islets in the host (26Shapiro A.M. Nanji S.A. Lakey J.R. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 196: 219-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the present study, we describe a new strategy to protect insulin-secreting cells based on the expression of an antiapoptotic N-terminal Ras-GAP fragment called fragment N. Efficient protection of the insulin-secreting βTC-tet cell line against genotoxins, degraded cellular environments, and inflammatory cytokines was achieved even with the lowest cellular expression of fragment N tested. It seems therefore unnecessary to strongly express fragment N in order to protect insulin-secreting cells. The potencies of fragment N and Bcl-2 to protect insulinoma cells were compared. Expression of both proteins in cells was achieved through infection with lentiviral vectors (this study) (16Dupraz P. Rinsch C. Pralong W.F. Rolland E. Zufferey R. Trono D. Thorens B. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1160-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The same methodology was therefore used to express these two proteins in the insulin-secreting cell line. In these conditions, it was observed that fragment N protected cells more efficiently against a variety of noxious stimuli than Bcl-2. The two proteins, however, clearly induced an additive protection signal when combined (e.g. against cisplatin-induced apoptosis or to counteract the negative effects of degraded environments). Strategies using two antiapoptotic molecules are therefore not necessarily mutually exclusive and might in fact confer additional levels of β cell protection. A very potent antiapoptotic mediator is the Akt kinase (27Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Akt is able to stimulate the NF-κB pathway (8Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar, 14Yang J.-Y. Widmann C. J. Biol.

Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar), and in some cell types, Akt-induced NF-κB activation is required for cell survival (8Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). In β cells, however, NF-κB stimulation can be detrimental (3Donath M.Y. Storling J. Maedler K. Mandrup-Poulsen T. J. Mol.

Mandrup-Poulsen T. Billestrup N. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 1998-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, in contrast with many cell types, expression of active Akt in β cells and a concomitant NF-κB activation could favor apoptosis. This has indeed been confirmed in vivo in mice expressing an Akt1 transgene under the control of the insulin promoter (31Tuttle R.L. Gill N.S. Pugh W. Lee J.P. Koeberlein B. Furth E.E. Polonsky K.S. Naji A. Birnbaum M.J. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). In HeLa cells, the N-terminal fragment of RasGAP generated following its partial cleavage by caspase-3 induces Akt but prevents Akt from activating the NF-κB pathway (14Yang J.-Y. Widmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14641-14646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We show here that fragment N does the same in insulin-secreting cells. Expression of fragment N in pancreatic β cells would therefore allow Akt to fulfill its antiapoptotic and proliferative functions and, at the same time, repress the potentially detrimental NF-κB-inducing activity of Akt (10Baker M.S. Chen X. Cao X.C. Kaufman D.B. J. Surg. Res. 2001; 97: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11Giannoukakis N. Rudert W.A. Trucco M. Robbins P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36509-36513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Our results indeed demonstrate that expression of fragment N in the βTC-tet insulinoma cell line confers long term protection from various adverse conditions and apoptotic stimuli, including inflammatory cytokines that are believed to be the pathophysiological mediators of β cell death leading to diabetes (3Donath M.Y. Storling J. Maedler K. Mandrup-Poulsen T. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 455-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Fragment N did not, however, affect the insulin secretion capacity of βTC-tet cells. This fragment represents therefore a potential therapeutic tool to protect β-cells in diabetogenic conditions without compromising their physiological properties.

Rabphilin is a cytosolic protein that is expressed in neurons and neuroendocrine cells and binds with high affinity to members of the Rab3 family of GTPases localized to synaptic vesicles and dense core granules. Rabphilin also interacts with α-actinin, a protein that cross-links F-actin into bundles and networks and associates with the granule membrane. Here we asked whether rabphilin, in addition to its granule localization, also interacts with the cell actin cytoskeleton. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy show that rabphilin localizes to the sub-plasmalemmal actin cytoskeleton both in neuroendocrine and unspecialized cells. By using purified components, it is found that association of rabphilin with F-actin is dependent on added α-actinin. In an in vitro assay, granules, unlike endosomes or mitochondria, associate with F-actin cross-linked by α-actinin. Rabphilin is shown to stimulate this process. Rabphilin enhances by ∼8-fold the granule ability to localize within regions of elevated concentration of cross-linked F-actin.

These results suggest that rabphilin, by interacting with α-actinin, organizes the cell cytoskeleton to facilitate granule localization within F-actin-rich regions. Rabphilin is a cytosolic protein expressed in neurons and endocrine cells that binds with high affinity to members of the Rab3 family of proteins, namely Rab3A, Rab3B, Rab3C, and Rab3D (for review see Ref. 1Gonzalez Jr., L. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 96: 755-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Rab3 proteins and rabphilin are localized to synaptic vesicles and dense core granules (2Li C. Takei K. Geppert M. Daniell L. Stenius K. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. De Camilli P. Sudhof T.C.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1639-1649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rabphilin has a Rab3A binding domain at the amino terminus of the protein and two C2 domains that bind to phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner at the carboxyl terminus (6Yamaguchi T. Shirataki H.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Rabphilin localization on synaptic vesicles and granules suggest a role in regulated exocytosis of these vesicles. In PC12 cells, rabphilin overexpression increased by 30% regulated hormone secretion, whereas anti-sense expression of the protein decreases hormone release by 30% (10Chung S.H. Takai Y. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16714-16718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Expression of rabphilin in insulin secreting cells enhanced by ∼2-fold regulated release of insulin (11Arribas M. Regazzi R. Garcia E. Wollheim C.B. De Camilli P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 209-216PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicate that rabphilin functions as a positive regulator of regulated exocytosis. Caenorhabditis elegans mutants with disrupted rabphilin function are severely lethargic in the absence of mechanical stimulation (12Nonet M.L. Staunton J.E. Kilgard M.P. Fergestad T. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R. Jorgensen E.M. Meyer B.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8061-8073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Differently, mutant mice lacking rabphilin did not have obvious physiological impairments (13Schluter O.M. Schnell E. Verhage M. Tzonopoulos T. Nicoll R.A. Janz R. Malenka R.C. Geppert M. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5834-5846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that other proteins can compensate for rabphilin function. Given the tight binding of rabphilin to members of the Rab3 family and the finding that both Rab3A and rabphilin dissociate from vesicles upon fusion (14Stahl B. Chou J.H. Li C. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. EMBO Eur. Mol. Biol. Organ. J. 1996; 15: 1799-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), efforts have been spent to determine whether rabphilin and Rab3 effects on regulated granule release or synaptic transmission were related. However, the stimulatory effects of rabphilin on hormone release were independent of Rab3 function (15Joberty G. Stabila P.F. Coppola T. Macara I.G. Regazzi R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3579-3587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and of association-dissociation cycles with membranes mediated by Rab3 (11Arribas M. Regazzi R. Garcia E. Wollheim C.B. De Camilli P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 209-216PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of regulated exocytosis induced by Rab3 overexpression was also independent of a direct interaction with rabphilin (8Chung S.H. Joberty G. Gelino E.A. Macara I.G. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18113-18120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Both mice and C. elegans rabphilin mutants did not have the synaptic transmission defects generated by Rab3 mutants (13Schluter O.M. Schnell E. Verhage M. Tzonopoulos T. Nicoll R.A. Janz R. Malenka R.C. Geppert M. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5834-5846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Staunton J. Ganetzky B. Nonet M.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9255-9264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, Rabphilin may have functions that are not directly related to those of Rab3 and vice versa. Interestingly, neurons of mice lacking Rab3 proteins have less rabphilin than the controls. Moreover, in the mutant mice, targeting of Rabphilin to the synapse is impaired (13Schluter O.M. Schnell E.

Thus, Rab3 function is important for rabphilin stability and targeting to the site of vesicle release. In addition to Rab3, rabphilin binds to another member of the Rab family of proteins, Rab27, which localizes to dense core granules and regulates hormone secretion (18Zhao S. Torii S.

Neuroscience. 1983; 8: 165-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In endocrine cells granules are specifically accumulated in an F-actin-rich region below the plasma membrane (26Nakata T.

Starting from these data, we hypothesized that rabphilin binds to the actin cytoskeleton in an α-actinin-dependent manner and thereby facilitates granule interactions with F-actin networks.

Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 209-216PubMed Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. Pietro De Camilli (Yale University, New Haven). Rabphilin was amplified from rabphilin-pcDNA3 with primers 5′-CGG GGT ACC ACC ATG ACT GAC ACT GTG AAC and 5′-GCT CTA GAC TAG TCG CTC GAC ACG TG, cut with KpnI and XbaI and subcloned into vector pIND (Invitrogen). GFP obtained from vector pEGFP-C1 by digestion with NheI and KpnI was subcloned into the plasmid rabphilin-pIND cut with the same restriction enzymes to obtain GFP-rabphilin-pIND. The pIND plasmids were co-transfected with pVGRXR (Invitrogen), to achieve inducible expression of rabphilin and rabphilin-GFP.

The product was digested with NheI and inserted into the pEGFP-C1 vector cut with NheI to obtain POMC-pEGFP. The Myc-Rab3A-pcB7 plasmid has been already described (4Martelli A.M. Baldini G. Tabellini G. Koticha D.D. Bareggi R. Baldini G. Traffic. 2000; 1: 976-986PubMed Google Scholar). Myc-tagged Rab3B in the pcDNA3 vector (Myc-Rab3B-pcDNA3) was a kind gift from Dr. Romano Regazzi (Université de Lausanne Lausanne, Switzerland). Rabphilin cDNA in the pGEX-2T vector was a kind gift from Dr. Ronald Holz (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) and Dr. I Macara (University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville). Preparation of Post-nuclear Supernatants, Gel Electrophoresis, and Immunoblotting—Post-nuclear supernatants from untransfected PC12 cells and PC12 cells expressing Myc-Rab3B were prepared from 6-cm tissue culture dishes. Cells were scraped in 0.4 ml of homogenization buffer containing Tris-HCl, 10 mm, pH 7.4, EDTA 1 mm, and protein inhibitors (300 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 6 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1.5 μg/ml pepstatin) and homogenized with 12 strokes in a 2-ml Teflon pestle homogenizer. The postnuclear supernatant was obtained by centrifugation of the homogenate at 600 × g for 5 min. Separation of proteins by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting, with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, densitometry, and protein determination were all performed as described (28Baldini G. Baldini G. Wang G. Weber M. Zweyer M. Bareggi R. Witkin J.W. Martelli A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Brain cytosol was prepared by homogenizing one rat brain in 10 ml of Kglu buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 120 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The homogenate was centrifuged at 95,000 rpm for 1 h in the TLA 100.2 rotor of the Beckman TLX centrifuge. The cytosol in the supernatant fraction was stored at -80 °C. Actin Polymerization—G-actin was stored at a concentration of 16 μm in G buffer containing 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm NaN3, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (29Benfenati F. Valtorta F. Chieregatti E. Greengard P. Neuron. 1992; 8: 377-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). G-actin was polymerized for 1 h at 30°C by adding one-tenth of the volume of 1 m KCl, 20 mm MgCl2. Cross-linking was induced by addition of 1 μm α-actinin, and samples were further incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. To obtain Alexa-fluor 568-conjugated F-actin, Alexa-fluor 568-conjugated G-actin was polymerized as above and cross-linked by addition of 1 μm α-actinin. Co-sedimentation of Rabphilin with F-actin—Recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) and rabphilin-GST were prepared by expression of pGEX-2T and pGEX-2T-rabphilin in Escherichia coli as previously described (30McKiernan C.J. Stabila P.F. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 4985-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by using the BCA kit (Pierce). F-actin was incubated with and without 1 μm α-actinin in the presence or in the absence of different concentrations of rabphilin-GST for 1 h at 30°C. Rabphilin binding to F-actin was determined by high speed co-sedimentation assay. Samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to pellet polymerized actin (31Nakano K. Imai J. Arai R. Toh E.A. Matsui Y. Mabuchi I. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4629-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The pellets and supernatants were collected, and one-tenth of the samples were loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot with antibodies against actin (MAB 1501) and against rabphilin. For Rab3A, Rab27, and α-actinin pull-down experiments, rabphilin-GST and GST were kept bound to the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) used for protein purification. Cell Culture and Transfections—Neuro2A (N2A) and COS-7 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. To transiently express rabphilin subcloned into the inducible vector pIND, COS-7 cells and N2A cells were co-transfected with rabphilin-pIND and pVGRXR or GFP-rabphilin-pIND and pVGRXR using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer (Invitrogen) instructions. Approximately 24 h after transfection, cells were trypsinized and plated on coverslips. After 5 h cells were induced with 5 μm Ponasterone A to induce expression of rabphilin. For some experiments, N2A cells were treated with retinoic acid (10 μm from a 1 mm stock in Me2SO) for 10 h to induce neurite formation. N2A cell were transiently transfected with POMC-pEGFP or Myc-Rab3A-pcB7 (4Martelli A.M. Baldini G. Tabellini G. Koticha D.D. Bareggi R. Baldini G. Traffic. 2000; 1: 976-986PubMed Google Scholar) 48 h before experiments. PC12 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. PC12 cells were transfected with Myc-Rab3B-pcDNA3 with Lipofectamine. Stably transfected colonies expressing Myc-Rab3B were selected by growth in the presence of hygromycin B. Preparation of Dense Core Granules Derived from N2A Cells—N2A cells (two 10-cm diameter tissue culture dishes) were washed twice with Kglu buffer and scraped from plates in the same buffer. Cells were broken in 0.4 ml of Kglu buffer by passing them five times through a 27.5-gauge syringe needle, and the post-nuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 7,200 × g for 10 min to obtain a pellet PII and a supernatant SII that contains cytosol and granule-containing fractions (32Koticha D.D. McCarthy E.E. Baldini G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3341-3351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SII was further centrifuged at 70,000 rpm for 30 min in the TLA 100.2 rotor of the Beckman TLX centrifuge to obtain the granule-containing pellet PIII and the supernatant SIII. Granules were re-suspended in GR buffer (0.1 ml) containing 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 1 mm GTP, and 1 mm ATP. Re-suspended granules were further centrifuged at 7,200 × g for 10 min to eliminate aggregates. The granules (40 μl) were mixed with F-actin (0.1 ml) preincubated in the presence or in the absence of α-actinin (1 μm) and rabphilin (2 μm) at 30 °C for 1 h. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 7,200 × g for 10 min. Co-sedimentation of granules with cross-linked actin was measured by Western blot analysis of the samples. For experiments where endosomes were loaded with human biotin-conjugated transferrin, N2A cells were washed with DMEM three times and then incubated with biotin transferrin in DMEM (5 μg/ml). After 1 h incubation at 37 °C, cells were incubated for 2 min in a mild acidic buffer (120 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaCl, pH 5.0) and then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline to release surface bound transferrin as described by others (33Martys J.L. Shevell T. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25976-25984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 34Dautry-Varsat A. Ciechanover A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2258-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Biotin-conjugated transferrin in cell fractions was detected by Western blots analysis using peroxidase-labeled streptavidin. Interaction of GFP-labeled Granules with Cross-linked F-actin—For experiments where the interaction of GFP-labeled granules with cross-linked F-actin was visualized by fluorescence microscopy, granules from N2A cells transiently expressing POMC-GFP (two 10-cm diameter tissue culture dishes) were obtained as described in the section above. Resuspended granules in GR buffer (40 μl) were mixed with Alexa-fluor-F-actin (0.1 ml) that was preincubated in the presence or in the absence of α-actinin (1 μm) and rabphilin (2 μm). After incubation at 30 °C for 1 h, 1 ml of Antifade reagent in phosphate-buffered saline was added to 20 μl of the samples to prevent sample photobleaching. The mixture was then transferred onto a glass slide, covered with a coverslip, and observed by fluorescence microscopy. In Vivo Labeling of N2A Cell Mitochondria—N2A cells plated on coverslips were washed twice with DMEM and incubated with 200 nm MitoTracker (diluted from a 0.2 mm stock solution in Me2SO). After 20-min incubation at 37 °C, cells were washed with DMEM twice and fixed for immunofluorescence with 3.7% formaldehyde solution in phosphate-buffered saline. For the in vitro experiments where mitochondria were mixed with cross-linked F-actin, a crude cell fraction containing mitochondria labeled with MitoTracker (see below) was obtained from N2A post-nuclear supernatants as described (35Sottocasa G.L. Kuylenstierna B. Ernster L. Bergstrand A. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 32: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). Briefly, the post-nuclear supernatant (0.4 ml) from a 10-cm plate incubated with 200 nm MitoTracker red as described above was centrifuged at 6,500 × g for 20 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. Mitochondria in the pellet were re-suspended in 0.4 ml of GR buffer, and 40 μl of the mixture was added to cross-linked F-actin (100 μl). Samples were then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. FITC-labeled phalloidin (1 μl) and Antifade reagent in phosphate-buffered saline (5 μl) were added to the mixture. Samples were transferred onto a glass slide, covered with a coverslip, and observed by fluorescence microscopy. Immunofluorescence, Confocal Microscopy, and Immunoelectron Microscopy—Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described previously (28Baldini G. Baldini G. Wang G. Weber M. Zweyer M. Bareggi R. Witkin J.W. Martelli A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fluorescence microscopy was done using a 63× objective, on a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope. Confocal microscopy was performed with a Zeiss LSM 510 scanning laser confocal attachment mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 100 TV inverted fluorescence microscope. Optical sections were 1-mm thick. Broken PC12 cells for immunoelectron microscopy were prepared for agarose embedding and immunoelectron microscopy as described (28Baldini G. Baldini G. Wang G. Weber M. Zweyer M. Bareggi R. Witkin J.W. Martelli A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Granule and mitochondria interaction with F-actin structures generated by α-actinin were visualized by using an Olympus 1X71 inverted microscope equipped with argon laser (488 nm) and helium/neon laser (543 nm). Images were collected by using Photometrics CoolSnap HQ camera controlled by Metamorph. To measure clustering of granules within the actin structures, images of actin and granules were collected with the same exposure time (250 ms). Images were then analyzed using the “ImageJ” software program from the National Institutes of Health. Merged images were separated into the red (actin) and green (granule) components. Images of actin and granules were processed using 200 pixels as an arbitrary threshold. The thresholded images were combined in a new image, and the areas of granule clusters (in black) within areas of actin were measured and expressed as ratio granule area/actin area. Rabphilin Binds to F-actin in an α-Actinin-dependent Manner—It is unknown whether the interaction of rabphilin with α-actinin (21Kato M. Sasaki T. Ohya T. Nakanishi H. Nishioka H. Imamura M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31775-31778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) leads to an association of rabphilin with F-actin. To determine whether this is the case, we investigated whether rabphilin binds to F-actin by using an in vitro assay with purified actin cytoskeleton components. Polymerization of G-actin generates actin filaments that sediment after high speed centrifugation (100,000 × g for 30 min), whereas addition of α-actinin induces formation of bundles and networks of F-actin (36Pelletier O. Pokidysheva E. Hirst L.S. Bouxsein N. Li Y. Safinya C.R. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2003; 91: 148102Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) that sediment at lower speed (10,000 × g for 10 min) (37Coghill I.D. Brown S. Cottle D.L. McGrath M.J. Robinson P.A. Nandurkar H.H. Dyson J.M. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24139-24152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We reasoned that binding of rabphilin to actin filaments, whether or not cross-linked with α-actinin, would lead to co-sedimentation of rabphilin and actin in the pellet after centrifugation at high speed. G-actin was first incubated in polymerization conditions to make F-actin and then further incubated in the presence of rabphilin with or without α-actinin. In the absence of α-actinin, after the high speed centrifugation step, ∼30% of the total actin in the sample was found in the pellet (Fig. 1). This indicates that a fraction of G-actin has polymerized into filaments in our experimental conditions. Recombinant GST-rabphilin appeared in the Western blot as two major bands of ∼70 kDa and 50 kDa, as described by others (30McKiernan C.J. Stabila P.F. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 4985-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Only a small fraction (<5%) of total rabphilin in the sample was found to co-sediment with F-actin. Thus, rabphilin does not bind directly to actin filaments. Addition of α-actinin increased the amount of actin in the pellet and induced co-sedimentation of rabphilin (60% of total) with actin. This indicates that rabphilin binds to F-actin in an α-actinin-dependent manner. Binding of rabphilin to F-actin saturates at ∼1.5 μm (Fig. 1B). In addition to α-actinin, rabphilin binds to activated, GTP-bound Rab3A, and Rab27 (7Ostermeier C. Brunger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 14Stahl B. Chou J.H. Li C. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. EMBO Eur. Mol. Biol. Organ.

Nishioka H. Imamura M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31775-31778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We investigated this possibility by in vitro pull-down experiments using GST-rabphilin immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose beads. Recombinant GTPγS-Rab3A bound to GST-rabphilin and not to GST immobilized onto the Sepharose beads (Fig. 1C). This shows that the commercial recombinant Rab3A preparation used in this study binds to rabphilin. When beads with GST-rabphilin or with GST-rabphilin-Rab3A were mixed with α-actinin, the same amount of α-actinin was pulled down (Fig. 1D). This indicates that both rabphilin and rabphilin-Rab3A bind to α-actinin. It has been shown that Rab3 and Rab27 bind to rabphilin (1Gonzalez Jr., L. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 96: 755-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 39Fukuda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 137: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, GST-rabphilin on the beads pulled down both Rab3 and Rab27 from brain cytosol. α-Actinin did not inhibit binding of either Rab3A or Rab27 to GST-rabphilin (Fig. 1E). In conclusion, these data suggest that the binding of rabphilin to Rab3A (or Rab27) and to α-actinin is not mutually exclusive. Rabphilin Localizes Both to the Actin Cell Cytoskeleton and to the Granules—The experiments described above suggest that rabphilin may bind to the cell actin cytoskeleton in addition to its established localizations in the cytosol and on the surface of dense core granules or synaptic vesicle (10Chung S.H.

Here, we investigated the regulation of COX-2 expression in normal and cancer ovarian surface epithelial cells. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is a potent inducer of COX-2 expression in the ovarian surface epithelium and this regulation is a critical step in ovulation. We observed that TNF-α stimulated COX-2 expression in human primary and immortalized epithelial (HIO) cell lines. The stimulation was suppressed by inhibitors of several signaling pathways, indicating the collaboration of TNF-α-activated signaling pathways mediates the regulation of COX-2 expression. In five ovarian cancer cell lines analysed, four did not express detectable COX-2 and TNF-α failed to elicit COX-2 expression. In NIH:OVCAR-5, the only ovarian cancer cell line expressing COX-2, signal pathway inhibitors no longer affected TNF-α-induced COX-2 expression. Thus, we conclude that TNF-α mediated signaling is uncoupled from the modulation of COX-2 expression in ovarian cancer. The loss of COX-2 expression was also observed to associate closely with epithelial neoplastic morphological transformation. The frequent loss of COX-2 expression suggests in ovarian cancer, unlike in other epithelial cancers, COX-2 expression does not contribute to ovarian cancer malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W2045335022,"BCR-ABL oncogene, the molecular hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia, arises in a primitive hematopoietic stem cell that has the capacity for both differentiation and self-renewal. Its product, Bcr-Abl protein, has been shown to activate signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) and to promote self-renewal in embryonic stem (ES) cells, even in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). MEK kinase 1 (MEKK1) is a 196-kDa mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase involved in Bcr-Abl signal transduction. To investigate the role of MEKK1 in Bcr-Abl-induced transformation of stem cells, p210 Bcr-Abl was stably transfected into wild-type (WT(p210)) and MEKK1-/- (MEKK1-/-(p210)) ES cells. Bcr-Abl enhanced MEKK1 expression in ES transfectants, as it does in other Bcr-Abl-transformed cells. In the absence of LIF, WT(p210) cells showed constitutive STAT3 activation and formed rounded, compact colonies having strong alkaline phosphatase activity, a characteristic phenotype of undifferentiated ES cells. MEKK1-/-(p210) cells, by contrast, showed less STAT3 activity than WT(p210) cells and formed large, flattened colonies having weak alkaline phosphatase activity, a phenotype of differentiated ES cells. These results indicate that MEKK1 plays a key role in Bcr-Abl-induced STAT3 activation and in ES cells' capacity for LIF-independent self-renewal, and may thus be involved in Bcr-Abl-mediated leukemogenesis in stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2038626735,"Genetic alterations in Rb2/p130 gene have been reported in several tumors, but till now there are insufficient and conflicting data linking the loss of pRb2/p130 expression with the mutational status of this gene in lung cancer. We recently reported that loss or lowering of pRb2/p130 expression is mainly due to aberrant Rb2/p130 promoter methylation, in retinoblastoma tumors, and indicated that epigenetic silencing of Rb2/p130 can impair its function to negatively regulate cell cycle progression as well as apoptotic response. In order to clarify Rb2/p130 gene inactivation in lung cancer, we investigated whether epigenetic events could impair the expression of this gene in NSLC. Here, we show that specific Rb2-exon 1 homozygous mutations, occurring in an Rb2/p130, region, rich in CpG dinucleotides, could be the ‘hit event’ that predispose this gene to epigenetic changes, leading to Rb2/p130 gene silencing in lung cancer. Moreover, these homozygous mutations, found in different tumor histotypes, could represent tumor-specific markers."
