To investigate the pathogenic mechanism by which loss of parkin function causes Parkinson's disease, we generated a mouse model bearing a germline disruption in parkin. Parkin–/– mice are viable and exhibit grossly normal brain morphology. Quantitative in vivo microdialysis revealed an increase in extracellular dopamine concentration in the striatum of parkin–/– mice. Intracellular recordings of medium-sized striatal spiny neurons showed that greater currents are required to induce synaptic responses, suggesting a reduction in synaptic excitability in the absence of parkin. Furthermore, parkin–/– mice exhibit deficits in behavioral paradigms sensitive to dysfunction of the nigrostriatal pathway. The number of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of parkin–/– mice, however, is normal up to the age of 24 months, in contrast to the substantial loss of nigral neurons characteristic of Parkinson's disease. Steady-state levels of CDCrel-1, synphilin-1, and α-synuclein, which were identified previously as substrates of the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of parkin, are unaltered in parkin–/– brains. Together these findings provide the first evidence for a novel role of parkin in dopamine regulation and nigrostriatal function, and a non-essential role of parkin in the survival of nigral neurons in mice.

Parkinson's disease (PD) 1The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson's disease; DA, dopamine; SN, substantia nigra; FPD, familial Parkinson's disease; AR-JP, autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism; ACSF, artificial cerebrospinal fluid; RMP, resting membrane potential; AP, action potential; AHP, afterhyperpolarization; PSP, postsynaptic potential; DOPAC, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid; HVA, homovanillic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. is an age-related movement disorder characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, and postural instability. The neuropathologic hallmarks of PD are the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and the presence of intraneuronal cytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy bodies. The clinical manifestations of PD are due to progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta of the SN that give rise to the nigrostriatal pathway, causing dopamine (DA) depletion in the striatum, where it is required for normal motor function. Little is known about the mechanisms of PD pathogenesis and nigral degeneration, although DA neurons have been shown to be susceptible to oxidative stress (1Fahn S. Cohen G. Ann.

The recent identification of genes linked to familial forms of PD (FPD) makes it possible to investigate the pathogenic mechanism by employing genetic approaches (4Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C.

Over fifty recessively inherited mutations, including deletion, frameshift, nonsense, and missense mutations, have been identified in parkin in large numbers of families, making parkin the major gene responsible for early-onset FPD (7Abbas N.

Although the first report linked parkin mutations to autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP) with atypical clinical features (5Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N.

The recessive inheritance mode and variety of parkin mutations indicate a loss-of-function pathogenic mechanism. Parkin is widely expressed in most tissues including brain and heart (5Kitada T.

Although its transcripts are equally abundant in various brain sub-regions, parkin protein is enriched in the SN (5Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M.

In vitro studies have shown that parkin can function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, mediating the covalent transfer of ubiquitin to protein substrates subject to proteasomal degradation (21Imai Y. Soda M. Takahashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35661-35664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 22Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13354-13359Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear how loss of parkin function leads to nigral degeneration and PD. To investigate the pathogenic mechanism of PD in an animal model and to elucidate the normal physiological role of parkin in vivo, we created a mouse model bearing a targeted germline disruption of parkin. Molecular, histological, neurochemical, electrophysiological, behavioral, and biochemical analyses of parkin–/– mice reveal a novel role for parkin in dopamine regulation and nigrostriatal function in vivo, and a non-essential role of parkin in the survival of nigral neurons in mice. Generation of parkin–/– Mice—A targeting vector was constructed using 1.8- and 3.5-kb DNA fragments as the 5′ and 3′ homologous sequences, respectively (Fig. 1A). A negative selection cassette, PGK-dt, which encodes the diphtheria toxin and has been shown to enhance screening efficiency as much as 75-fold (24Yu H. Kessler J. Shen J. Genesis. 2000; 26: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), was also included. The linearized targeting vector was transfected into J1 (129/Sv) ES cells. After selection in G418, 200 clones were screened by Southern analysis for homologous recombination. Six clones were identified by the presence of the expected 3.7-kb band corresponding to the targeted allele. Using the 3′ external probe and a probe specific for the neo sequence, two clones were confirmed to carry the desired homologous recombination events without random insertion. ES cells of both clones were injected into C57BL/6 and Balb/c blastocysts. Chimeric offspring were crossed with C57BL/6 mice to obtain germline transmission, which was confirmed by Southern analysis with the 5′ probe shown in Fig. 1A. Heterozygous mice were then interbred to obtain homozygous knockout and wild-type control mice. Mice were subsequently genotyped by PCR using primers (5′-CCTACACAGAACTGTGACCTGG; 5′-GCAGAATTACAGCAGTTACCTGG; 5′-ATGTTGCCGTCCTCCTTGAAGTCG) specific for the wild-type or the targeted allele. The resulting 250 and 500 bp PCR products correspond to the wild-type and targeted alleles, respectively. All experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the USPHS Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Northern, RT-PCR, and Western—Northern and RT-PCR were performed as previously described (25Yu H. Saura C.A. Choi S.-Y. Sun L.D. Yang X. Handler M. Kawarabayashi T. Younkin L. Fedeles B. Wilson M.A. Younkin S. Kandel E.R. Kirkwood A. Shen J. Neuron. 2001; 31: 713-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, brains were Dounce-homogenized in buffer (0.33 m sucrose, 8 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, Roche complete protease inhibitors for parkin, or 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, Roche complete protease inhibitors for α-synuclein, synphilin-1 and CDCrel-1) and centrifuged, and the protein content of the supernatant was analyzed by BCA assay (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation of α-synuclein for detection of the glycosylated species was performed essentially as previously described (26Shimura H. Schlossmacher M.G. Hattori N. Frosch M.P. Trockenbacher A. Schneider R. Mizuno Y. Kosik K.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2001; 293: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 10 mg of supernatant was used for the immunoprecipitation of α-synuclein and the IP antibody (KC7071) was used at a 1:10 dilution. For Western blotting, 50 μg of protein was mixed with 2× Laemmli buffer, boiled, and resolved on 10% acrylamide gels (parkin, synphilin-1, and CDCrel-1) or 4–20% gradient gels (α-synuclein) (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked in 5% milk in TBST (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20), and incubated with a primary antibody (Parkin, Cell Signaling 2132; 1:1000; CDCrel-1, gift of Dr. William Honer, 1:1000; α-synuclein, Syn-1, BD PharMingen, 1:2000; synphilin-1, gift of Dr. Simone Englender, 1:100) and then a peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (parkin, CDCrel-1, and synphilin-1) or mouse (α-synuclein) antibody (Promega). The membranes were then treated with chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to film. Samples were reprobed with tubulin and actin to confirm equal protein loading. Histology and Neuron Count—Mouse brains were dissected, formalin fixed for 2 h, processed for paraffin embedding, and sectioned in the coronal plane at 16-μm thickness. Each paraffin block contained 4 parkin–/– and 4 wild-type brains. Deparaffinized sections were stained with cresyl violet or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) antibodies. The number of DA neurons in the SN was determined by counting TH-immunoreactive neurons in coronal sections of four brains per genotype per age group using the fractionator and optical dissector methods of unbiased stereology (27Sterio D. J. Microsc. 1983; 134: 127-136Crossref Scopus (2244) Google Scholar) under a Leica DMRB microscope equipped with a CCD camera connected to a computer running Bioquant image analysis software. The same software was used to measure nigral DA neuron volumes from 4 wild-type and 4 parkin–/– brains at the age of 24 months. The experimenter was blind to the genotypes of the mice. Values are reported as means ± S.E. Statistical differences were assessed by Student's t test. Striatal DA Measurements—For striatal tissue DA measurement, striata were dissected and stored at –80 °C. Frozen striata were sonicated in ice-cold 0.1 n perchloric acid, 0.2 mm sodium bisulfite and centrifuged 20 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C to remove debris. The supernatant was filtered (0.2 μm) and applied to a C18 reverse phase HPLC column linked to an ESA model 5200A electrochemical detector. For no-net-flux microdialysis, parkin–/– and wild-type mice were implanted unilaterally under halothane anesthesia with a microdialysis probe (CMA 11, 2-mm membrane length, CMA/Microdialysis, Chelmsford, MA) in the striatum using the following stereotaxic coordinates measured from bregma and the skull surface in mm: rostral +0.6, lateral +1.8, ventral +4.5. Probes were perfused with an artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF: 0.2 mm ascorbic acid, 125 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 0.9 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm Na2HPO4, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 0.5 μl/min. After 24 h, DA was incorporated in the microdialysis perfusion medium at 5 different concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20, 40 nm) each for 2 h in random order and dialysate was collected in 30 min. intervals into 1.5 μl of 12.5 mm perchloric acid/250 μm EDTA. Samples were frozen at –70 °C for analysis by HPLC with electrochemical detection (Antec Leyden, Zoeterwoude, The Netherlands) as described previously (28Murphy N.P. Lam H.A. Maidment N.T. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 626-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The difference in DA concentration between the perfusion medium flowing into the probe and that flowing out of the probe ([DA] in – [DA] out) was plotted on the y-axis against [DA]i n on the x-axis. A line of best fit was constructed by least-squares analysis. The intercept at the x-axis (DA concentration at the point of no net flux) and the slope of the line (the extraction fraction, a measure of DA reuptake) was determined for each animal and differences between genotypes were assessed by Students' t test. Dopamine Receptor Binding Assays—D1 and D2 binding assays were performed with [3H]spiperone and [3H]SCH23390, essentially as previously detailed (29Shapiro D.A. Renock S. Arrington E. Chiodo L.A. Liu L.X. Sibley D.R. Roth B.L. Mailman R. Neuropsychopharmacology. 2003; 28: 1400-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar) using crude synaptic membrane fractions prepared from mouse striata (prepared as described in Ref. 30Roth B.L. McLean S. Zhu X.Z. Chuang D.M. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 1833-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with ketanserin (100 nm) included to inhibit binding to 5-HT2A/2C serotonin receptors. Protein determinations were performed using the BioRad kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Binding data were analyzed with Prism (GraphPad) as previously described (31Roth B.L. Baner K. Westkaemper R. Siebert D. Rice K.C. Steinberg S. Ernsberger P. Rothman R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11934-11939Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Data represent mean ± S.E. of 3–6 separate determinations from striata isolated from wild-type and parkin–/– animals. Statistical differences were assessed by Student's t test. Electrophysiology—Detailed electrophysiological procedures were previously described (32Klapstein G.J. Fisher R.S. Zanjani H. Cepeda C. Jokel E.S. Chesselet M.F. Levine M.S. J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 86: 2667-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with halothane, decapitated, brains were placed in ice-cold oxygenated ACSF (in mm: NaCl 130, NaHCO3 26, KCl 3, MgCl2 5, NaH2PO4 1.25, CaCl2 1, glucose 10 (pH 7.2–7.4)) and coronal corticostriatal sections (∼350 μm) were made so that striatal neurons could be studied both intracellularly and by activation of their main excitatory input from the cortex. Slices were transferred to a submersion recording chamber in which they were perfused constantly with oxygenated ACSF (31–32 °C) in an atmosphere of warm, moist 95% O2, 5% CO2. Intracellular responses were recorded using sharp microelectrodes (60–110 MOhms) filled with 3 m potassium acetate, 5 mm KCl, and 2% w/v biocytin to facilitate subsequent examination of the morphology of recorded neurons. Basic passive and active membrane properties (resting membrane potential (RMP), current-voltage relationships, input resistance, action potential (AP) parameters (amplitude and half-amplitude duration), after hyperpolarization (AHP) amplitude) were examined using intracellularly injected current pulses to determine neuronal excitability. Values are reported as means ± S.E. Synaptic responses were evoked with a bipolar stimulating electrode placed in the corpus callosum to activate primarily corticostriatal afferents, the main excitatory pathway into the striatum, which release glutamate. Stimuli of increasing intensity (100-μs duration) were delivered every 5 s and 5 traces at each intensity were averaged. Peak amplitudes of postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) were measured, and input-output relationships were plotted. From each cell, the averaged PSP whose peak amplitude was 50% of maximum on the input-output curve was further analyzed for between-group comparisons of peak amplitudes and half-amplitude durations. Paired-pulse facilitation was assessed by presenting two stimuli, which evoked responses at 50% maximum amplitude 50 ms apart and measuring the ratio of the peak amplitude of the second PSP divided by the first PSP. Biocytin labeling confirmed that all recovered neurons were mediumsized spiny neurons with similar appearance between genotypes. Behavioral Tests—All tests were performed by investigators blind to the genotypes. For the open field test, individual mice were placed in 42 × 42 cm acrylic animal cages for 15 min during which their horizontal and vertical movements were monitored by 3 arrays of 16 infrared light beam sensors (AccuScan Instruments) and analyzed using AccuScan VersaMax software. For the rotarod test, mice were placed 4 at a time on an Economex accelerating rotarod (Columbus Instruments) equipped with individual timers for each mouse. Mice were initially trained to stay on the rod at a constant rotation speed of 5 rpm. After a 2-min rest, mice that would fall were repeatedly placed back on the rotarod until they were able to stay on the rotating rod for at least 2 min. Following training, mice were subsequently tested by placing them on the rod at a rotation speed of 5 rpm, as the rod accelerated by 0.2 rpm/sec, the latency to fall was measured. Mice were tested for a total of 3 trials. For the beam traversal task, a Plexiglas beam (Plastics Zone Inc., Woodland Hills, CA) consisting of four sections (25 cm each, 1 m total length) of varying width (3.5, 2.5, 1.5, and 0.5 cm) was used. To increase the difficulty of the test, a wire mesh cover (1 cm2) of corresponding width was placed on the beam surface. Mice were trained for 2 days to traverse the beam without the wire mesh to their home cages. On the day of the test, mice were trained further with two trials without the grid overlay and two trials with the wire grid placed on the beam. Mice were then tested for 3 trials by traversing the grid-surfaced beam, and their performance was videotaped. The numbers of steps and slips (a limb slipped through the wire grid during a forward movement) were counted by viewing the videotapes in slow motion. Fisher's LSD was used for planned comparisons between genotypes. For the adhesive removal test, small adhesive stimuli of five increasing sizes were placed on the forehead, out of view for the mice. The stimuli consisted of 0.25 and 0.5 inch Avery labels cut in half or whole or combined. To remove the stimulus, mice raised both forelimbs toward their head and swiped off the stimulus with both forepaws within a 60-s trial, after which the experimenter removed the adhesive. Each mouse was given a score equal to the largest size adhesive it was unable to sense and remove, averaged over two trials. Scores were compared between genotypes using a Mann-Whitney U test. All mice were able to sense and remove the largest size adhesive, but none could sense and remove the smallest adhesive. Generation of Parkin-deficient Mice—parkin is a large gene (∼2 Mb), which contains 12 exons and encodes a protein of 465 amino acid residues (5Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4196) Google Scholar, 33Asakawa S. Tsunematsu K. Takayanagi A. Sasaki T. Shimizu A. Shintani A. Kawasaki K. Mungall A.J. Beck S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The exon 3 deletion mutation is one of the most common mutations in AR-JP and results in absence of parkin protein (8Hattori N. Kitada T. Matsumine H. Asakawa S. Yamamura Y. Yoshino H. Kobayashi T. Yokochi M. Wang M. Yoritaka A. Kondo T. Kuzuhara S. Nakamura S. Shimizu N. Mizuno Y. Ann. Neurol. 1998; 44: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 18Kitada T. Asakawa S. Matsumine H. Hattori N. Shimura H. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Mizuno Y. Neurogenetics. 2000; 2: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Yoshikawa M. Kitada T. Matsumine H. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Yamamura Y. Shimizu N. Mizuno Y. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 45: 668-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Exon 3 contains a non-integral number of codons, thus, deletion of exon 3 results in a frameshift after amino acid 57 and premature termination at a stop codon in exon 4 following 39 additional out-of-frame amino acid residues in humans (8Hattori N. Kitada T. Matsumine H. Asakawa S. Yamamura Y. Yoshino H. Kobayashi T. Yokochi M. Wang M. Yoritaka A. Kondo T. Kuzuhara S. Nakamura S. Shimizu N. Mizuno Y. Ann.

Ann. Neurol. 1999; 45: 668-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We therefore chose to target exon 3 to generate a parkin-null mutant mouse. A targeting vector was constructed in which most of exon 3 was replaced in-frame by the coding sequence of EGFP, followed by translation and transcription termination sequences and the PGK-neo cassette (Fig. 1A). The protein sequences predicted to result from wild-type and mutant transcripts are depicted in Fig. 1B. Two clones of ES cells carrying the proper homologous recombination events without random integration of the targeting vector were injected into blastocysts. Germline transmission of the targeted allele was confirmed by Southern analysis (Fig. 1C). Interbreeding of heterozygous mice gave rise to wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous knockout (parkin–/–) mice at the expected Mendelian ratio. To determine whether our targeted mutation causes skipping of exon 3, we performed Northern and RT-PCR analyses. Northern analysis of total RNA using a probe specific for exons 4–12 showed a smaller parkin transcript in parkin–/– brains (Fig. 1D). RT-PCR analysis using primers specific for exons 2 and 5 followed by sequencing confirmed that in parkin–/– brains exon 2 was spliced to exon 4, skipping exon 3 entirely (Fig. 1E). Exon 3 skipping causes a reading frameshift after amino acid 57 and premature termination at a stop codon in exon 5 following 49 additional out-of-frame amino acid residues in mice (Fig. 1B). The sensitivity of RT-PCR confirmed the complete absence of intact parkin transcripts in parkin–/– mice. Sequencing also revealed an aberrant splice product, which results from the use of a cryptic splice acceptor site 3 bases into exon 4, leading to addition of 48 rather than 49 out-of-frame amino acid residues (Fig. 1B). Although these truncated parkin transcripts are present in parkin–/– mice, it is unlikely that functional parkin fragments can be produced from these truncated transcripts. Western analysis using an antiserum raised against the C-terminal region of parkin confirmed the absence of parkin in parkin–/– mice (Fig. 1F), and ruled out the presence of possible parkin fragments initiated from in-frame ATGs downstream of exon 3, consistent with the notion that reinitiation of translation following a sizable open reading frame is highly unlikely (34Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 5226-5232Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Since we introduced the EGFP cDNA fused in-frame into parkin exon 3, which was intended for a reporter system for the parkin promoter activity, we also performed Northern analysis using an EGFP-specific probe and confirmed the presence of EGFP transcripts in parkin–/– mice (data not shown). RT-PCR followed by sequencing confirmed that the EGFP coding sequence is intact and fused in-frame to parkin exon 3. However, the parkin-EGFP fusion protein was barely detectable by Western analysis (data not shown), perhaps due to the presence of the ubiquitin-like domain of parkin (35Finney N. Walther F.

Open field tests of parkin–/– mice revealed no significant alterations in their general behavior and exploratory anxiety (Fig. 2). Nissl staining revealed normal brain morphology in parkin–/– mice (Fig. 3, A and B). Immunohistochemical analysis of parkin–/– brains using antibodies specific for synaptophysin, Munc-18 and calbindin showed grossly normal synaptic staining and striatum formation (data not shown). No inclusions were observed in any brain sub-regions, including the SN, using antibodies specific for α-synuclein and ubiquitin (data not shown).Fig. 3Normal neuroanatomy in parkin–/– brains.

Little is known about how loss of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> in a small number of mitochondria might influence the overall function of the cell. Here we employ the narrow focal excitation volume of the two-photon microscope to examine the effect of local mitochondrial depolarization in guinea pig ventricular myocytes. Remarkably, a single local laser flash triggered synchronized and self-sustained oscillations in ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>, NADH, and ROS after a delay of ∼40s, in more than 70% of the mitochondrial population. Oscillations were initiated only after a specific threshold level of mitochondrially produced ROS was exceeded, and did not involve the classical permeability transition pore or intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload. The synchronized transitions were abolished by several respiratory inhibitors or a superoxide dismutase mimetic. Anion channel inhibitors potentiated matrix ROS accumulation in the flashed region, but blocked propagation to the rest of the myocyte, suggesting that an inner membrane, superoxide-permeable, anion channel opens in response to free radicals. The transitions in mitochondrial energetics were tightly coupled to activation of sarcolemmal <i>K</i> <sub>ATP</sub> currents, causing oscillations in action potential duration, and thus might contribute to catastrophic arrhythmias during ischemia-reperfusion injury."

We report the characterization of a GSK3 inhibitor, AR-A014418, which inhibits GSK3 (IC50 = 104 ± 27 nM), in an ATP-competitive manner (K i = 38 nM). AR-A014418 does not significantly inhibit cdk2 or cdk5 (IC50 > 100 μM) or 26 other kinases demonstrating high specificity for GSK3. We report the co-crystallization of AR-A014418 with the GSK3β protein and provide a description of the interactions within the ATP pocket, as well as an understanding of the structural basis for the selectivity of AR-A014418. AR-A014418 inhibits tau phosphorylation at a GSK3-specific site (Ser-396) in cells stably expressing human four-repeat tau protein. AR-A014418 protects N2A neuroblastoma cells against cell death mediated by inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B survival pathway. Furthermore, AR-A014418 inhibits neurodegeneration mediated by β-amyloid peptide in hippocampal slices. AR-A014418 may thus have important applications as a tool to elucidate the role of GSK3 in cellular signaling and possibly in Alzheimer's disease.

The onset is insidious, and the loss of memory is an early indicator of the disease. As the disease progresses, there are psychiatric abnormalities and motor deficits and death occurs within 7-8 years after diagnosis. The pathological hallmarks of AD include extracellular amyloid plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) (1Alzheimer A. Z. Gesamte Neurol. Psychiat. 1911; 4: 356-385Crossref Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 2Yankner B.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 921-932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Neurode-generation is also evident in the limbic regions of the brain, and brain atrophy occurs at the later stages. The density of NFTs correlates extremely well with the clinical severity of the disease, and the distribution follows a characteristic pattern of expansion as the disease progresses (3Braak H. Braak E. Acta Neuropathol. (Berl.). 1991; 82: 239-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (11641) Google Scholar). This provides a compelling argument that strategies to inhibit factors leading to NFT development and neuronal death would be useful in the treatment of mid-moderate stage AD. NFTs are found in the neuronal cell bodies and apical dendrites and comprise aggregates of paired helical filaments (PHFs), which are assembled from hyperphosphorylated forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau (4Avila J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 5Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2001; 67: 59-71Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 6Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar). Pathologic alterations in the microtubule-associated protein tau leading to PHFs and subsequently NFT have been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative disorders, particularly dementias, including AD, dementia pugilistic, progressive supranuclear palsy, frontotemporal dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis dementia (6Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar). GSK3β, also called tau phosphorylating kinase I (7Ishiguro K. Shiratsuchi A. Sato S. Omori A. Arioka M. Kobayashi S. Uchida T. Imahori K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), is a serine/threonine kinase that has highest abundance in brain and is localized primarily in neurons (8Woodgett J.R.

Aberrant increase in GSK3β expression and activity in adult brain has been directly linked to several of the key neuropathological mechanisms of AD (11Shiurba R.A. Ishiguro K. Takahashi M. Sato K.

Nature. 2003; 423: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). GSK3 has two major isoforms (α and β), which are 98% identical within the catalytic domain. GSK3 phosphorylates tau at most sites, which becomes abnormally hyperphosphorylated in PHFs, both in cells (13Lovestone S. Reynolds C.H. Latimer D. Davis D.R. Anderton B.H. Gallo J.M. Hanger D.

Lee V.M. Klein P.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). The most crucial pathological link with AD has been its association with PHFs (16Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K.

Science. 1991; 251: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). GSK3 has also been linked to the downstream effects of β-amyloid. Exposure of cortical and hippocampal primary neuronal cultures to β-amyloid induces the activation of GSK3β (18Takashima A. Noguchi K. Michel G. Mercken M. Hoshi M. Ishiguro K. Imahori K. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 203: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and cell death (19Busciglio J. Lorenzo A. Yeh J.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) inhibits Aβ-induced neurodegeneration of cortical and hippocampal primary cultures. Presenilin-1 (PS-1), a protein influencing APP metabolism and linked to familial AD, has been shown to directly bind GSK3β and tau in co-immunoprecipitation experiments from human brain samples (22Takashima A. Murayama M. Murayama O. Kohno T. Honda T. Yasutake K. Nihonmatsu N. Mercken M. Yamaguchi H. Sugihara S. Wolozin B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9637-9641Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of PS-1 to bring GSK3β and tau into close proximity suggests that PS-1 may regulate phosphorylation of tau by GSK3β. Mutant PS-1 results in increased PS-1/GSK3β association and increased phosphorylation of tau (22Takashima A. Murayama M. Murayama O. Kohno T. Honda T. Yasutake K. Nihonmatsu N. Mercken M. Yamaguchi H. Sugihara S. Wolozin B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9637-9641Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PS-1 forms a complex with the GSK3β substrate β-catenin in transfected cells (23Yu G. Chen F. Levesque G. Nishimura M. Zhang D.M. Levesque L. Rogaeva E. Xu D. Liang Y. Duthie M.

Sturchler-Pierrat C. Staufenbiel M. Sommer B. van de Wetering M. Clevers H. Saftig P. De Strooper B. He X. Yankner B.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Pathogenic PS-1 mutations reduce the ability of PS-1 to stabilize β-catenin, which in turn results in decreased β-catenin levels in brains from AD patients with PS-1 mutations (25Zhang Z. Hartmann H. Do V.M. Abramowski D. Sturchler-Pierrat C. Staufenbiel M. Sommer B. van de Wetering M. Clevers H. Saftig P. De Strooper B. He X. Yankner B.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). GSK3β phosphorylates pyruvate dehydrogenase and inhibits it in response to β-amyloid; as a consequence, a reduction in ATP and ACh synthesis has been described in hippocampal neurons (26Hoshi M. Takashima A. Noguchi K. Murayama M. Sato M. Kondo S. Saitoh Y. Ishiguro K. Hoshino T. Imahori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2719-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that GSK3β is located at the convergence of pathways involved in AD-like tau hyperphosphorylation, β-amyloid-induced toxicity, PS-1 mutations, and ACh metabolism, all of which are relevant to AD. Recent evidence using lithium and short interfering RNAs directed toward GSK3α block the production of Aβ by interfering with APP at the γ-secretase step but not Notch processing (51Phiel C.J. Wilson C.A. Lee V.M. Klein P.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). The effects of the GSK3 inhibitor lithium was observed in cells, as well as in transgenic mice that overproduce APP. An increase in GSK3 levels or activity in AD post mortem tissue, compared with non-diseased human brain, has been described by several researchers. Using active site antibodies, GSK3 has been shown to localize to pretangle neurons, dystrophic neurites, and NFTs in AD brain (12Pei J.J. Braak E. Braak H. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Winblad B. Cowburn R.F. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 1010-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Neurons actively undergoing granulovacular degeneration are also immunopositive for active GSK3 (27Leroy K. Boutajangout A. Authelet M. Woodgett J.R. Anderton B.H. Brion J.P. Acta Neuropathol. (Berl.). 2002; 103: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A spatial and temporal pattern of increased active GSK3β expression coinciding with the progression of NFT and neurodegeneration has been reported (11Shiurba R.A. Ishiguro K. Takahashi M. Sato K. Spooner E.T. Mercken M. Yoshida R. Wheelock T.R. Yanagawa H. Imahori K. Nixon R.A. Brain Res. 1996; 737: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies provide evidence that the active form of GSK3β is increased in AD brain. Because active GSK3β triggers signal transduction events that participate in cell death (28Bhat R.V. Shanley J. Corell M.P. Fieles W.E. Keith R.A. Scott C.W. Lee C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11074-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 29Hetman M. Cavanaugh J.E. Kimelman D. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and loss of neuronal and synaptic plasticity (30Salinas P.C. Hall A.C. Bipolar Disord. 1999; 1: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), a significant part of the AD pathology could result from an abnormal increase in GSK3β expression and activity. When GSK3β transgene expression is induced in brain, adult mice developed hyperphosphorylated tau at the PHF-1 site (phospho-epitope at Ser-396/404) (31Lucas J.J. Hernandez F. Gomez-Ramos P. Moran M.A. Hen R. Avila J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), a site critical for PHF formation and represents increased phosphorylation in AD brain (32Otvos Jr., L. Feiner L. Lang E. Szendrei G.I. Goedert M. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 39: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). These mice also developed pretangle structures in the hippocampus, as well as increased neuronal death, gliosis, and spatial learning deficits in the Morris water maze (33Hernandez F. Borrell J. Guaza C. Avila J. Lucas J.J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1529-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Overexpression of human tau, in combination with its phosphorylation by the Drosophila GSK3β homologue Shaggy, exacerbates neurodegeneration induced by tau overexpression alone and gives rise to NFT pathology in the fly (34Jackson G.R.

Taken together, these studies provide strong evidence that increased GSK3β expression and activity are necessary for the early events leading to pretangle and neurodegenerative pathology that is associated with AD. Accordingly, several groups have identified small molecule GSK3 inhibitors (35Coghlan M.P. Culbert A.A. Cross D.A. Corcoran S.L. Yates J.W. Pearce N.J. Rausch O.L. Murphy G.J. Carter P.S.

However, the majority of the reported inhibitors are not selective against GSK3 and also affect cdk2, a kinase that shares 33% amino acid identity with GSK3, or cdk5, another protein kinase involved in tau phosphorylation. In addition, there is a lack of basic information about the structural basis of the interaction between GSK3β and these inhibitors, as co-crystallization studies have not been reported. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a thiazole, N-(4-methoxybenzyl)-N′-(5-nitro-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)urea (AR-A014418), which is a selective and potent inhibitor of GSK3 able to decrease tau phosphorylation and cell death. Furthermore, the co-crystallization of AR-A014418 with the GSK3β protein provides the structural information required to understand the high selectivities of this inhibitor. Propidium iodide (PI) was purchased from Sigma and calcein-AM from Molecular Probes. Antibody Tau5 was purchased from Research Diagnostics Inc., and tau Ser(P)-396 was from BIOSOURCE International. Anti-GSK3β was from Transduction Laboratories. The peptide β-amyloid 25-35 was from Bachem and was prepared as described previously (48Studer L. Spenger C. Luthman J. Seiler R.W. J. Comp.

The biotinylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) peptide, biotin-AAEELDSRAGS(PO3H2)PQL, was synthesized at AstraZeneca R&D Lund (Lund, Sweden). A peptide based on glycogen synthase, RRRPASVPPSPSLSRHS-S(PO4)-HQRR, was produced by Auspep Pty. Ltd. (Parkville, Australia). The biotinylated peptide biotin-AKKPKTPKKAKKL-OH used in cdk5 assay was produced by Bachem AG (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-retinoblastoma expressed in a GST expression system and cdk5/p25 (co-transfected 2:5) were supplied by AstraZeneca Biotech Laboratory (Södertälje, Sweden). Recombinant human GSK3 was obtained from Dundee University (Dundee, Scotland, United Kingdom) and contained a mixture of GSK3β and GSK3α to a minor extent. Baculoviral cdk2/cyclin E enzyme was supplied by Enabling Science & Technology Biology Department, AstraZeneca R&D, Alderley Park, United Kingdom. [γ-33P]ATP, protein A, and streptavidin-coated scintillation proximity assay (SPA) beads were purchased from Amersham Biosciences UK. The synthesis of AR-A014418 is outlined in Scheme I. In brief, commercially available 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole and 4-methoxybenzylisocyanate was mixed in N,N-dimethylformamide to give AR-A014418 in 22% yield. The aqueous solubility of AR-A014418 was determined to be 136 μm. A mixture of 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole (0.89 g, 6.13 mmol) and 4-methoxybenzylisocyanate (1 g, 6.13 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (6 ml) was heated at 100 °C under nitrogen atmosphere for 15 h. The mixture was allowed to cool and was partitioned between water and ethyl acetate. The aqueous layer was extracted with another portion of ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried (MgSO4), and evaporated to give 2.5 g of a semisolid crude product. Most of the material was dissolved in chloroform/ethanol (98:2, approximately 15 ml) and triethylamine (3 ml), followed by filtration. The dissolved crude product was purified on a silica gel column using chloroform/ethanol (95:5) as the eluent to give 408 mg (22% yield) of the title compound as a yellowish solid: mp >190 °C (decomposition); 1H NMR (Me2SO-d 6, 400 MHz) δ 11.64 (br s, 1 H), 8.50 (s, 1 H), 7.25-7.23 (m, 3 H), 6.92-6.89 (m, 2 H), 4.30 (d, J = 5.9 Hz, 2 H), 3.73 (s, 3 H); 13C NMR (Me2SO-d 6, 100 MHz) δ 164.42, 158.43, 153.48, 143.47, 140.80, 130.82, 128.72, 113.82, 55.08, 42.60; MS(ES) m/z 309 (M+ + 1). Full-length human GSK3β was cloned into the NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites of pET28a(+) (Novagen) via the PCR Script vector (Stratagene) using the PCR primers 5′-CATCATATGTCAGGGCGGCCCAGAACC and 5′-TCATCAGGTGGAGTTGGAAGCTGATGC. An NcoI-EcoRI gene fragment was subsequently subcloned into pFASTBAC HTb (Invitrogen) resulting in a construct with an N-terminal double histidine tag with the following amino acid sequence: MSYYHHHHHHDYDIPTTENLYFQGAMGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSH-. Briefly, Sf21 cells were transfected with recombinant bacmid DNA using Superfect (Qiagen) and incubated for 3 days at 27 °C. The virus particles were amplified in Sf21 cells for 7 days and titrated using the Clontech titration kit. High Five cells were grown at 27 °C in a 20-liter cell culture bioreactor (BBI) in Expression High Five SFM medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 12 mm l-glutamine, 5 mm asparagine, and 0.1% NaCl. The culture was infected with the recombinant baculovirus with a multiplicity of infection of 2 at a cell density of 2.12 × 106 cells/ml. The cells were harvested 46 h after infection using a Contifug Stratos centrifuge. The cells were washed with PBS, frozen, and stored in -80 °C prior to purification. The cells were thawed, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine, and EDTA-free Complete Protease Inhibitor, Roche Diagnostics) to a density of 20 × 106 cells/ml, and then lysed by using an Ultra-Turrax T50 (Janke & Kunkel). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 3 °C and 35,000 × g using an Avanti J-20 with a JLA 16.250 rotor (Beckman). Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences), previously loaded with 0.5 bed volume of 0.1 m Ni2SO4, was added in a ratio of 2 ml of Sepharose/109 cells, and GSK3β was allowed to adsorb to the matrix in a batch fashion for 60 min at 4 °C. All subsequent steps were performed at room temperature. Unbound protein was removed with Buffer A (lysis buffer without protease inhibitor) using a sintered glass filter funnel, and the resin was packed into a column, further washed with Buffer A, and then washed with Buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole. GSK3β protein was finally eluted with Buffer A containing 500 mm imidazole. GSK3β-containing fractions were pooled and loaded onto a Sephadex G25 column equilibrated with Buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 350 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mm Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine. The final protein was aliquoted, frozen, and stored in -80 °C. Approximately 8 mg of >95% pure GSK3β was produced per liter of cultivation. The histidine tag was removed by thrombin cleavage using 500 units of thrombin (Amersham Biosciences)/70 mg of protein for 4 h at room temperature and cleavage at a second site (after arginine 6) was observed. A residual thrombin activity remained despite later purification steps, and the protein preparation used for crystallization was a mix of full length and the 7-420 species. Unphosphorylated and phosphorylated GSK3β was separated using a 6-ml Resource S column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 80 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 5% glycerol, using a 20-column volume gradient from 80 to 350 mm NaCl. Full-length unphosphorylated GSK3β eluted at approximately 200 mm NaCl, and the peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to 6.3 mg/ml (λ280 = 34,960 m-1 cm-1). Crystals were grown using the hanging drop method. A 1.5 + 1.5-μl drop consisting of protein solution (130 μm GSK3β, 250 μm AR-A014418, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, and 1.3% Me2SO) and well solution (17% polyethylene glycol 3350, 50 mm BisTris propane, pH 6.5, and 5 mm urea) was placed over 500 μl of well solution at 20 °C. Crystals grew within a few days to a size of 100 μm and were soaked in cryo solution (15% glycerol, 10% polyethylene glycol 3350, 100 mm NaCl, and 50 mm BisTris propane, pH 6.5) before being frozen in a 100 K nitrogen stream. All the structure descriptions in this paper are based on the refined structure using the synchrotron data. Details of data collection and refinement statistics are recorded in Table I. The current R-factor/R free is 0.22/0.24. Data were first collected using in-house x-ray source (CuKα radiation; wavelength = 1.54 Å) to a resolution of 3.1 Å on a Mar-Research 345-mm image-plate detector system. X-ray radiation was generated by a Rigaku RU300HB rotating anode operated at 50 kV and 100 mA. The crystal belongs to orthorhombic space group P212121, with cell parameters of a = 82.028 Å, b = 84.215 Å, and c = 178.091 Å. Molecular replacement was carried out with program MOLREP using overlaid structures of cdk2, ERK, and p38g as the search model. To prepare the search model, these three structures were first superimposed using program MAPS, and then each was trimmed manually in the program O to remove some loop regions to ∼260 residues, respectively. MOLREP found two molecules after rotation and translation search with R-factor/correlation coefficient of 0.514/0.280. Phase improvement with solvent flattening (solvent content 0.622) and 2-fold density averaging was performed using the program DM. The solution was verified by inspection of the calculated electron density map in program O after phase improvement. Subsequently the cdk2 model from molecular replacement was used for initial refinement and model building. A high resolution data set (1.94 Å) was later collected at beamline ID29 (wavelength of 1.0064 Å) in ESRF (Grenoble, France).Table ICrystallography: data collection and refinement statisticsData collectionIn-house data (λ = 1.54 Å)Synchrotron data, ID29 European Synchotron Radiation Facility (λ = 1.0064 Å)Space groupP212121P212121Cell parameter (Å)82.03, 84.21, 178.0982.58, 84.91, 178.42Solvent content (%)62.963.5Resolution (last shell) (Å)3.11 (3.11-3.30)1.94 (1.94-2.04)Unique reflections21,48278,815R merge (all/last shell)0.290/0.6690.071/0.431I/I s (all/last shell)2.4/1.17.1/1.7Completeness (%) (all/last shell)94.3/93.484.4/58.9Redundancy3.77.2Structure refinementResolution (last shell) (Å)1.94 (1.94-2.06)Number of reflections used (last shell)78,753 (9134)Fraction of test set for calculating R free (%)3.4No. of reflections in the test set (last shell)2670 (310)R work (last shell)0.222 (0.274)R free (last shell)0.243 (0.291)Root mean square deviation bond lengths (Å)/bond angles (°)0.006/1.2Estimated coordinate error (Luzzati plot/SigmaA) (Å)0.26/0.21B values (mean B value/Wilson plot) (Å2)40.4/41.3Number of atoms: final model (protein/waters/ligand)5521/373/42 Open table in a new tab GSK3 Scintillation Proximity Assay—The competition experiments were carried out in duplicate with 10 concentrations of the inhibitor in clear-bottomed microtiter plates.

https://openalex.org/W2101257555,"A cDNA that encodes a novel Na+-independent neutral amino acid transporter was isolated from FLC4 human hepatocarcinoma cells by expression cloning. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the encoded protein designated LAT3 (L-type amino acid transporter 3) transported neutral amino acids such as l-leucine, l-isoleucine, l-valine, and l-phenylalanine. The LAT3-mediated transport was Na+-independent and inhibited by 2-aminobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid, consistent with the properties of system L. Distinct from already known system L transporters LAT1 and LAT2, which form heterodimeric complex with 4F2 heavy chain, LAT3 was functional by itself in Xenopus oocytes. The deduced amino acid sequence of LAT3 was identical to the gene product of POV1 reported as a prostate cancer-up-regulated gene whose function was not determined, whereas it did not exhibit significant similarity to already identified transporters. The Eadie-Hofstee plots of LAT3-mediated transport were curvilinear, whereas the low affinity component is predominant at physiological plasma amino acid concentration. In addition to amino acid substrates, LAT3 recognized amino acid alcohols. The transport of l-leucine was electroneutral and mediated by a facilitated diffusion. In contrast, l-leucinol, l-valinol, and l-phenylalaninol, which have a net positive charge induced inward currents under voltage clamp, suggesting these compounds are transported by LAT3. LAT3-mediated transport was inhibited by the pretreatment with N-ethylmaleimide, consistent with the property of system L2 originally characterized in hepatocyte primary culture. Based on the substrate selectivity, affinity, and N-ethylmaleimide sensitivity, LAT3 is proposed to be a transporter subserving system L2.

System L is a plasma membrane amino acid transport system, which mediates Na+-independent transport of large neutral amino acids (1Christensen H.N. Physiol.

It was first characterized in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells as a transport system specifically inhibited by a bicyclic amino acid, 2-aminobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH) 1The abbreviations used are: BCH, 2-aminobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid; LAT1, L-type amino acid transporter 1; SLC, solute carrier; LAT2, L-type amino acid transporter 2; LAT3, L-type amino acid transporter 3; 4F2hc, 4F2 heavy chain; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; TAT1, T-type amino acid transporter 1.

System L is a major route to provide cells with branched-chain and aromatic amino acids. In addition, system L is present in the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells and plays important roles in the absorption of amino acids through the epithelial cells of small intestine and renal proximal tubules (1Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). System L is also pivotal in the permeation of amino acids through the blood–tissue barriers such as blood–brain barrier and placenta barrier (1Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). By means of expression cloning, we identified the first isoform of system L amino acid transporter LAT1 (L-type amino acid transporter 1) in C6 rat glioma cells (10Kanai Y. Segawa H. Miyamoto K. Uchino H. Takeda E. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23629-23632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). LAT1 is a member of the SLC (solute carrier) 7 family with putative 12-membrane-spanning domains (11Kanai Y. Endou H. Curr.

LAT1 mediates a Na+-independent amino acid exchange and prefers large neutral amino acids such as leucine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, methionine, and histidine for its substrates (10Kanai Y.

We and others further demonstrated that a single-membrane-spanning protein, the heavy chain of 4F2 antigen (4F2hc), is essential for the functional expression of LAT1 in the plasma membrane (10Kanai Y.

Following the identification of LAT1, transporters structurally related to LAT1 have been found to be associated with 4F2hc or other single-membrane-spanning subunit rBAT (related to the b0,+ amino acid transporter), establishing the heterodimeric amino acid transporter family (11Kanai Y. Endou H. Curr. Drug Metab. 2001; 2: 339-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 19Verrey F. Meier C. Rossier G. Kuhn L.C. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 440: 503-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These transporters include systems asc, y+L, x-C, and b0,+ as well as the second system L isoform, LAT2 (11Kanai Y. Endou H. Curr.

LAT2 is more ubiquitously expressed than LAT1 and transports not only large neutral amino acids but also small neutral amino acids (20Pineda M. Fernandez E. Torrents D. Estevez R. Lopez C. Camps M.

Even after the finding of the heterodimeric amino acid transporters, some of the previously reported properties of system L still remain to be explained by the properties of LAT1 and LAT2. For example, system L2 characterized in hepatocyte primary culture exhibits narrower substrate selectivity in which it prefers leucine, isoleucine, and phenylalanine, distinct from that of LAT1 and LAT2 (5Weissbach L. Handlogten M.E. Christensen H.N. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12006-12011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that still unidentified system L transporters should be present. During the search for culture cell lines with the amino acid transport properties distinct from those of LAT1 and LAT2, we have found that human hepatocarcinoma-derived cell line FLC4 (23Nagamori S.

Miyamura T. Virology. 1998; 250: 140-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) exhibits a unique character in the leucine transport. In this study, we have performed expression cloning to identify the system L transporter of FLC4 cells and isolated a cDNA encoding a novel amino acid transporter. The transporter is structurally distinct from the heterodimeric transporters and exhibits the properties corresponding to system L2. Expression of FLC4 Cell Poly(A) + RNA—FLC4 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (23Nagamori S. Hasumura S. Matsuura T. Aizaki H.

The total RNA from the FLC4 cells was prepared by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method using cesium trifluoroacetic acid (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. The poly(A)+ RNA was selected by oligo(dT) cellulose chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) (25Utsunomiya-Tate N. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol.

Hediger M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 17-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A positive pool was sequentially subdivided and analyzed until a single clone (LAT3) was identified. The cDNA was sequenced in both direction by dye terminator cycle sequencing method (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Transmembrane regions of proteins were predicted based on TopPred2 algorithm (31von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). Functional Characterization—Xenopus oocytes were injected with 25 ng of LAT3 cRNA synthesized in vitro from the LAT3 cDNA in plasmid pSPORT1 (Invitrogen) linearized with NotI (25Utsunomiya-Tate N. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14883-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Three days after injection, the uptake of 14C-labeled amino acids was measured as described above in the regular uptake solution (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1mm CaCl2,1mm MgCl2,10mm HEPES, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4) or Na+-free uptake solution in which NaCl in the regular uptake solution was replaced by choline chloride, containing 0.5–2.0 μCi/ml of radiolabeled compounds. For Cl--free uptake solution, Cl- in the regular uptake solution was replaced by gluconate anion. To prepare uptake solution with varied pH for pH dependence experiments, MES-NaOH (pH 5.5 and 6.0), PIPES-NaOH (pH 6.5 and 7.0), HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5 and 8.0), and Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) were used for buffer systems (21Segawa H.

Preliminary experiments to determine the time course of l-[14C]leucine (3 mm) uptake into oocytes expressing LAT3 indicated that the uptake was linearly dependent on incubation time up to 30 min (data not shown), so for all the following experiments uptakes were measured for 30 min, and the values were expressed as picomoles/oocyte/min. The effect of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) on the transport was examined by measuring the l-[14C]leucine uptake after 15-min preincubation of the oocytes expressing LAT3 or LAT1 with Na+-free uptake solution containing 5 mm NEM at room temperature (32Novak D.A. Kilberg M.S. Beveridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). After removing the solution for preincubation, the uptake of l-leucine by the oocytes was measured in the Na+-free uptake solution containing 100 μm l-[14C]leucine with or without 5 mm NEM. The uptake values were compared with those measured without NEM preincubation. For the expression of LAT1, Xenopus oocytes were injected with 17.6 ng of human LAT1 cRNA and 7.4 ng of human 4F2hc cRNA at a final molar ratio of 1:1 (13Yanagida O. Kanai Y. Chairoungdua A. Kim D.K.

Acta. 2001; 1514: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters of amino acid substrates were determined based on the LAT3-mediated amino acid uptakes measured at 1, 3, 10, 30, 60, 100, 200, 400, 1000, 2000, and 3000 μm of substrates. LAT3-mediated amino acid uptakes were calculated as differences between the means of uptakes of the oocytes injected with LAT3 cRNA and those of the control oocytes injected with water. Because Eadie-Hofstee plots were curvilinear for the substrates of LAT3, apparent K m and V max were estimated by fitting the concentration-dependent substrate transport to the following equation for two-component kinetics using KaleidaGraph 3.5 (Synergy Software Technologies, Essex Junction, VT): v = [V max1 × s/(K m1 + s)] + [V max2 × s/(K m2 + s)], where K m1 and V max1 are K m and V max values of component 1; K m2 and V max2 are K m and V max values of component 2; and s is the substrate concentration (33Coons D.M. Boulton R.B. Bisson L.F. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3251-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For the efflux measurement, 100 nl (3 nCi) of l-[14C]leucine (100 μm) was injected into oocytes with a fine-tipped glass micropipette as described elsewhere (30Kim D.K. Kanai Y. Chairoungdua A.

The individual oocytes were incubated for 5 min in the ice-cold Na+-free uptake solution and then transferred to the Na+-free uptake solution kept at room temperature (18–22 °C). The radioactivity in the medium and the remaining radioactivity in the oocytes were measured. The values were expressed as percent radioactivity (radioactivity of medium/(radioactivity of medium + radioactivity of oocytes) × 100%) (30Kim D.K. Kanai Y. Chairoungdua A. Matsuo H. Cha S.H.

For the uptake and efflux measurements in the present study, six to ten oocytes were used for each data point. Each data point in the figures represents the mean ± S.E. of uptake (n = 6–10). To confirm the reproducibility of the results, three separate experiments using different batches of oocytes and in vitro transcribed cRNA were performed for each measurement. Results from the representative experiments are shown in figures. Electrophysiological Measurements—The electrical currents induced by 10 mm l-leucine, l-leucinol, l-valinol, and l-phenylalaninol in both control and LAT3-cRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes were recorded during voltage clamp at -60 mV by two-electrode voltage camping using Gene-Clamp 500 (Axon Instruments) in the standard bath solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2,1mm MgCl2,5mm HEPES, pH 7.4) (26Kanai Y.

The baseline electrical current was first determined and then 10 mm of l-leucine, l-leucinol, l-valinol, or l-phenylalaninol was added to the bath medium for 2 min. The solution was then changed back to the standard uptake solution, and the record was continued until the electrical current was returned to the baseline level. Northern Analysis—The cDNA fragment corresponding to 1790–1936 bp of LAT3 cDNA (GenBank™/EMBL/DDBJ accession number AB103033) was PCR-amplified and labeled with [32P]dCTP using a T7 Quick prime kit (Amersham Biosciences) (25Utsunomiya-Tate N. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14883-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Multiple Tissue Northern Blots (Clontech) were hybridized with the probe and processed following the manufacturer's instructions. FLC4 poly(A)+ RNA prepared as described above and human liver poly(A)+ RNA (Clontech) were separated on a 1% agarose gel in the presence of 2.2 m formaldehyde and blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter (Schleicher & Schuell) (25Utsunomiya-Tate N. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14883-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed for 20 h at 42 °C as described elsewhere (25Utsunomiya-Tate N. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14883-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The filters were washed in 0.1 × SSC/0.1% SDS at 65 °C. When poly(A)+ RNA from FLC4 human hepatocarcinoma cells was expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, significant augmentation of l-[14C]leucine uptake was detected. The size-fractionation of the FLC4 poly(A)+ RNA revealed that the fraction of 2.2–2.7 kb exhibited the peak activity of l-[14C]leucine uptake (data not shown). From this fraction, a cDNA library was constructed and screened for l-[14C]leucine uptake by expression in Xenopus oocytes. A 2.5-kb cDNA was isolated that encodes a protein designated LAT3 (L-type amino acid transporter 3). When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, LAT3 induced l-[14C]leucine transport, which was not dependent on Na+ or Cl- in the medium (Fig. 1, a and b). Although LAT3-mediated l-[14C]leucine uptake was saturable, its Eadie-Hofstee plot was curvilinear, suggesting the presence of multiple components for the l-leucine uptake induced by the expression of a single protein LAT3 (Fig. 1c). The concentration-dependent substrate uptake was fit to the two-component kinetics (see “Experimental Procedures”). The apparent K m and V max were estimated by best fitting and shown in Table I.Table IKinetic parameters of amino acid substrates In each set of experiments to determine Km and V max values, L-leucine uptake (100 μM) was measured to compare V max values between experiments. The V max value of each amino acid was normalized to that of L-leucine in the same experiment.Amino acidKm 1aKm 1 and V max1 represent Km and V max of the low affinity component, whereas Km 2 and V max2 represent Km and V max of the high affinity component, respectively.

Km 1, V max1, Km 2, and V max2 values were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” Open table in a new tab The substrate selectivity of LAT3 was investigated by inhibition experiments in which l-[14C]leucine (100 μm) uptake was measured in the presence of 10 mm amino acids. The l-leucine uptake was highly inhibited by l-isomers of isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, and methionine (Fig. 2a). Weaker inhibition was detected when the other neutral amino acids were used as inhibitors. Acidic amino acids, l-aspartate and l-glutamate, and basic amino acids, l-lysine and l-arginine, did not inhibit LAT3-mediated l-[14C]leucine uptake (Fig. 2a). Although d-amino acids less affected LAT3-mediated l-[14C]leucine uptake, d-leucine, d-histidine, and d-methionine showed relatively strong inhibitory effects on the l-[14C]leucine uptake (24.9 ± 1.7%, 47.8 ± 2.1%, and 59.2 ± 2.1% of the control l-[14C]leucine uptake measured in the absence of inhibitors, respectively; data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2a, the system L inhibitor, 2-aminobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH), exhibited strong inhibition on l-[14C]leucine uptake mediated by LAT3, whereas α-aminoisobutyric acid and system A inhibitor α-(aminomethyl)isobutyric acid had no inhibitory effect (data not shown). Consistent with the results from the inhibition experiments, 14C-labeled l-leucine, l-isoleucine, l-valine, l-phenylalanine, and l-methionine (100 μm) were transported at relatively high rate by LAT3 (Fig. 2b). Among d-amino acids, d-leucine, for which a 14C-labeled compound was available, was confirmed to be transported by LAT3 (Fig. 2b). As observed for l-leucine uptake, the Eadie-Hofstee plots for the uptake of l-isoleucine, l-valine, and l-phenylalanine were curvilinear (data not shown). Kinetic parameters of these amino acid substrates are listed in Table I. To examine the mechanisms of substrate recognition, the effects of amino acid-related compounds on LAT3-mediated l-[14C]leucine uptake was examined. As shown in Fig. 3, l-leucinol, l-valinol, and l-phenylalaninol, which have a hydroxymethyl group instead of an α-carboxyl group, exhibited relatively strong inhibition on LAT3-mediated l-[14C]leucine uptake. 1,3-Dimethyl-n-butylamine also exhibited relatively strong inhibition. Isopentylamine, isobutylamine, and 2-phenylethylamine, which possess side chains of l-leucine, l-valine, and l-phenylalanine, respectively, and lack α-carboxyl groups, exhibited weak but significant inhibition on the LAT3-mediated l-[14C]leucine uptake. In contrast, 4-methylvaleric acid, isovaleric acid, and 3-phenylpropionic acid, which possess side chains of l-leucine, l-valine, and l-phenylalanine, respectively, and lack α-amino groups, had no inhibitory effects. In addition, weak inhibition was observed for l-leucine methylester and N-methyl-l-leucine, whereas l-leucinamide and N-acetyl-l-leucine had no inhibitory effect on LAT3-mediated l-[14C]-leucine uptake (Fig. 3). To examine whether LAT3-mediated transport is electrogenic or not, we performed electrophysiological measurements. Under the voltage clamp at -60 mV, l-leucinol, l-valinol, and l-phenylalaninol (10 mm) induced significantly larger inward current in the Xenopus oocytes expressing LAT3 than that in the control oocytes, whereas the current induced by l-leucine (10 mm) was indistinguishable between LAT3-expr"

Here, we have studied heteromerization in the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel family. Using a combination of fluorescence confocal microscopy, coimmunoprecipitation, and electrophysiology we found that upon coexpression in HEK293 cells almost all dimeric combinations of HCN channel subunits give rise to the formation of stable channel complexes in the plasma membrane. We also identified HCN1/HCN2 heteromers in mouse brain indicating that heteromeric channels exist in vivo. Surprisingly, HCN2 and HCN3 did not coassemble to heteromeric channels. This finding indicates that heteromerization requires specific structural determinants that are not present in all HCN channel combinations. Using N-glycosidase F we show that native as well as recombinant HCN channels are glycosylated resulting in a 10–20-kDa shift in the molecular weight. Tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, blocked surface membrane expression of HCN2. Similarly, a mutant HCN2 channel in which the putative N-glycosylation site in the loop between S5 and the pore helix was replaced by glutamine (HCN2N380Q) was not inserted into the plasma membrane and did not yield detectable whole-cell currents. These results indicate that N-linked glycosylation is required for cell surface trafficking of HCN channels. Cotransfection of HCN2N380Q with HCN4, but not with HCN3, rescued cell surface expression of HCN2N380Q. Immunoprecipitation revealed that this rescue was due to the formation of a HCN2N380Q/HCN4 heteromeric channel.

The hyperpolarization-activated cation current I h (or I f, I q) plays a key role in the control of important biological processes such as heart beat (1DiFrancesco D. Annu. Rev.

In mammals, the HCN channel family comprises four homologous members (HCN1–4). Structurally, HCN channels belong to the superfamily of voltage-gated cation channels. Like other members of this family HCN channels are supposed to form tetramers with fundamental building blocks consisting of six hydrophobic segments (S1–S6), a positively charged S4 sensor, and an ion-conducting hairpin between S5 and S6. In the cytosolic carboxyl terminus each of the four HCN channel subunits carries a cyclic nucleotide-binding site mediating modulation by cAMP. Expression of HCN1–4 cDNAs in heterologous expression systems yields currents with the hallmark properties of I h, namely activation by membrane hyperpolarization, permeation of Na+ and K+, shift of the activation curve to more depolarized voltages by intracellular binding of cAMP, and blockage by low millimolar concentrations of extracellular Cs+. While all four HCN channels share the above-mentioned general features they also differ from each other with respect to their activation speed, their half-maximal voltage of activation (V 0.5) and the extent by which V 0.5 is shifted by cAMP. For example, HCN1 activates fast (τact < 100 ms at -140 mV) and is only slightly affected by cAMP (shift of V 0.5 = +1–3 mV), whereas HCN4 is activated rather slowly (τact > 500 ms at -140 mV) and is profoundly shifted by cAMP (shift of V 0.5 = +15 mV). The functional heterogeneity of HCN1–4 at least partly explains the diversity of native I h in different cell types, especially in neurons. Further complexity of I h may be generated in vivo by post-translational modification of channel subunits (e.g. glycosylation), by the presence of auxilliary subunits (8Yu H. Wu J. Potapova I.

The coassembly of subunits to functional heteromers is a mechanism that is found in a number of voltage-gated cation channels, such as voltagegated K+ channels (9Choe S. Nat. Rev.

Circulation. 2003; 107: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) provided initial evidence that HCN channels may also exist as heteromers. So far, heteromerization of HCN channel subunits has been investigated only for a limited number of subunit combinations. Moreover, the present studies solely rely on the electrophysiological analysis of I h currents obtained after coexpression of HCN channel subunits. In particular, there are no data showing HCN subunit interaction directly at the protein level.To address these important issues, we have studied the assembly of all dimeric combinations of HCN channel subunits using fluorescence confocal microscopy and coimmunoprecipitation. We provide evidence that most subunits can coassemble to heteromers. As an exception from this behavior we find that the HCN3 subunit does not form functional channels with HCN2. Finally, we identify N-glycosylation of HCN channel subunits as a crucial factor for controlling HCN channel trafficking.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of HCN Channel Fusion Proteins and Mutants—For immunofluorescence studies full-length HCN channels were fused at the COOH termini to EGFP or DsRed (RFP) domains to yield murine HCN1-EGFP (mHCN1-EGFP), mHCN2-EGFP, mHCN2-RFP, mHCN2N380Q-EGFP, mHCN3-EGFP, mHCN3-RFP, human HCN4-EGFP (hHCN4-EGFP), and hHCN4-RFP. In addition, the following HCN channels containing a carboxyl-terminal myc-tag were constructed: mHCN1-myc, mHCN2-myc, mHCN3-myc, and hHCN4-myc. All chimeric channels were generated by deleting the respective STOP codons in the HCN channel cDNAs and simultaneously introducing a unique restriction site at this location. The resulting cDNAs were cloned inframe with sequences encoding EGFP, DsRed, or myc-tag into vectors pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany), pDsRed1-N1 (Clontech), and pcDNA3.1/myc-His (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). The point mutant mHCN2N380Q was created using PCR with overlapping mutagenic primers in the pcDNA3 vector. All constructs were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The plasmid pECFP-Mem (Clontech) was used as a marker to visualize the cell membrane.Cell Culture and Heterologous Expression—HEK293 cells (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For microscopy and electrophysiological analysis, glass coverslips were coated in 24-well dishes with poly-l-lysine (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany), and 30,000 HEK293 cells per well were seeded. After 6 h the cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids using FuGENE 6® transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). For coimmunoprecipitation HEK293 cells were seeded on 6-well plates (φ 3.5 cm) at a density of 500,000 cells per well. Six hours later they were transfected with 0.6 μg per well of each expression plasmid using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent.Fluorescence Confocal Microscopy—Ninety hours after transfection, cells grown on coverslips were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After washing twice with PBS for 10 min the coverslips were transferred to a microscope slide and mounted using Permafluor® mounting medium (Immunotech, Marseille, France). Mounted cells were stored at 4 °C for several days. Confocal examinations were performed with a LSM 510 META (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) at wavelengths specific for the utilized fluorescent protein tags: DsRed, 543 nm; EGFP, 488 nm; ECFP, 458 nm. For tunicamycin (Sigma) treatment, 5 μg/ml tunicamycin was added to HEK293 cells seeded on coverslips 5 h after transfection with mHCN2-EGFP. Seventy-two hours later coverslips were treated as described above for focal examination.Coimmunoprecipitation—Seventy-two hours after transfection cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with 500 μl of Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH = 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8, 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml antipain, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm orthophenanthroline, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm iodacetamide). The lysate was centrifuged (15 min, 4 °C, 12,000 × g), and the supernatant was subjected to coimmunoprecipitation. The supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 30 μl protein A-Sepharose (Sigma), a specific antibody directed against one of the two overexpressed proteins and 500 μl of HNTG buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH = 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, pH = 8, 0.1% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitors as indicated above). Beads were pelleted by centrifugation (15 min, 4 °C, 12,000 × g) and washed three times with cold HNTG buffer, and proteins were visualized after boiling for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with 100 mm dithiothreitol by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blot analysis. The following antibodies were used: anti-HCN1 (Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel), anti-HCN2 (AS2, Ref. 16Ludwig A. Budde T. Stieber J. Moosmang S. Wahl C. Holthoff K. Langebartels A. Wotjak C. Munsch T. Zong X. Feil S. Feil R. Lancel M. Chien K.R. Konnerth A. Pape H.C. Biel M. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), anti-HCN4 (Alomone), and anti-myc (Cell Signaling/New England BioLabs Inc., Frankfurt am Main, Germany). As a control antibody an antibody directed against the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel CNGB3 (17Gerstner A. Zong X. Hofmann F. Biel M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1324-1332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used.Membrane Preparation and Deglycosylation Assay—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected using calcium phosphate. Seventy-two hours after transfection cells were washed with PBS, harvested with a cell scraper, and centrifuged (10 min, 1,000 × g). Pellets were resuspended in ice cold MOPS lysis buffer (0.3 mm sucrose, 20 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA supplemented with protease inhibitors: 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml antipain, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm orthophenanthroline, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm iodacetamide) and homogenized at 4 °C using a glass cylinder and a Teflon plunger. Homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 5,000 × g. The pellet was rehomogenized and spun once more for 10 min. The combined supernatants were then centrifuged (45 min, 4 °C, 100,000 × g). The pellet comprising the total membrane fraction was resuspended in MOPS lysis buffer and stored at -80 °C. Membrane preparation of total mouse brain was performed equally.Deglycosylation was carried out by first boiling the membrane protein fraction in 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% SDS for 5 min. The mixture was then transferred to a solution composed of 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH = 8.0, 20 mm orthophenanthroline, and 1% Triton X-100. Finally 5 units of N-glycosidase F (Roche Diagnostics) were added, and the reaction was incubated overnight at 37 °C.Electrophysiology—Currents were measured at room temperature 2–3 days after transfection using whole cell patch clamp technique. The extracelluar solution was composed of (in mm): 110, NaCl; 0.5, MgCl2; 1.8, CaCl2; 5, HEPES; 30, KCl; pH = 7.4 adjusted with NaOH. The intracellular solution contained (in mm): 130, KCl; 10, NaCl; 0.5, MgCl2; 1, EGTA; 5, HEPES; pH = 7.4 adjusted with KOH. Data were acquired at 10 kHz using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pClamp 8 (Axon Instruments). Voltage clamp data were stored on the computer hard disk and analyzed off-line by using Clampfit 8 (Axon Instruments). For determination of current densities currents were evoked by a hyperpolarizing voltage pulse to -140 mV for 2.25 s from a holding potential of -40 mV. Current amplitudes were measured at the end of the pulse to -140 mV and were normalized with respect to cell membrane capacitance (C m) to obtain current densities. For determination of half-maximum activation voltage (V 0.5) steady-state activation curves were determined by hyperpolarizing voltages (-140 to -30 mV) from a holding potential of -40 mV for 2.25 s followed by a step to -140 mV. Tail currents immediately after the final step to -140 mV were normalized to maximum current at -140 mV and plotted as a function of the preceding membrane potential. The data points were fitted with the Boltzmann function: (I - I min)/(I max - I min) = [1 - exp([V m - V 0.5]/k)], where I min is an offset caused by a nonzero holding current, V m is the test potential, V 0.5 is the membrane potential for half-maximal activation, and k is the slope factor. Time constants of channel activation (τact) of wild type and mutant HCN2 channels were determined by monoexponential function fitting the current evoked during hyperpolarizing voltage pulses to -140 mV. As has been described earlier (18Ludwig A. Zong X. Stieber J. Hullin R. Hofmann F. Biel M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2323-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) the initial lag in the activation of HCN channel currents was excluded from the fitting procedure.All values are given as mean ± S.E. (n = number of experiments).RESULTSColocalizazion of Heterologously Expressed HCN Channel Subunits—To investigate the colocalization of HCN channel subunits, the four HCN channel subunits were COOH-terminally fused to either green (EGFP) or red (RFP) fluorescent tags and transiently coexpressed in HEK293 cells. In electrophysiological experiments these HCN channel fusion proteins behaved very similar to wild type channels indicating that the COOH-terminal tag does not interfere with principal channel properties. The only differences observed were somewhat slower activation kinetics in some of these channels (see below). Fig. 1, A–D, shows a series of confocal fluorescence images taken from a cell coexpressing HCN1 (green fluorescence; Fig. 1A) and HCN2 (red fluorescence; Fig. 1B). As a marker for the cellular plasma membrane the blue fluorescent ECFP-Mem protein was coexpressed together with the two channel subunits (Fig. 1C). It is evident that both HCN channels are highly enriched in the plasma membrane, whereas in the cytosol almost no fluorescence is seen. The merged image (Fig. 1D) shows a complete overlap of HCN1 and HCN2 expression (yellow). Similarly, overlapping expression in the plasma membrane was observed for the following subunit combinations: HCN1/HCN3 (Fig. 1E), HCN1/HCN4 (Fig. 1F), HCN2/HCN4 (Fig. 1G), and HCN3/HCN4 (Fig. 1H). In contrast, plasma membranes of cells coexpressing HCN2 and HCN3 consistently revealed a patchy appearance with areas in which either green or red fluorescence dominated. Fig. 1I shows a merged image of two HCN2/HCN3 coexpressing cells indicating that there is by and large no overlap of HCN2 (green) and HCN3 (red) fluorescence. Taken together these experiments indicate that with the exception of HCN2/HCN3 dimeric combinations of HCN channel subunits colocalize in the plasma membrane.Coimmunoprecipitation of HCN Channel Subunits—The overlap of fluorescence could be due to the colocalization of homomeric HCN channels or could reflect the presence of heteromeric HCN channels. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments. For the experiments shown in Fig. 2A wild type HCN1 was transiently coexpressed with either myc-tagged HCN2, HCN3, or HCN4. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal anti-myc antibody and then subjected to Western blot analysis with an anti-HCN1 antibody. In all three experiments a major band of about 110 kDa was recognized by the anti-HCN1 antibody. This is in agreement with the size of the HCN1 protein as predicted from the primary sequence (102 kDa). In immunoprecipitations with a control antibody no specific band was detected. In some experiments a band of about 125 kDa was detected in addition to the 110-kDa band (see HCN2/1 lane). This band very likely represents the glycosylated HCN1 protein because it disappeared after treatment with N-glycosidase F (see Fig. 4A). In total brain lysates, which were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-HCN2 antibody (16Ludwig A. Budde T. Stieber J. Moosmang S. Wahl C. Holthoff K. Langebartels A. Wotjak C. Munsch T. Zong X. Feil S. Feil R. Lancel M. Chien K.R. Konnerth A. Pape H.C. Biel M. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) and probed with anti-HCN1 antibody, only the 125-kDa band was detected indicating that the glycosylated form is the major HCN isoform in vivo (Fig. 2B). Formation of heteromeric channels was also demonstrated for HCN3/HCN4 and HCN2/HCN4 channels (Fig. 2C) and for the coexpression of HCN4/HCN2 (Fig. 2D). In contrast, formation of a stable HCN3/HCN2 channel complex was not detected (Fig. 2D, third lane). The lack of biochemically detectable interaction between HCN2 and HCN3 is in complete agreement with the fluorescence data (Fig. 1I).Fig. 2Detection of heteromeric HCN channels by coimmunoprecipitation. A, lysates from HEK293 cells transiently cotransfected with HCN1 and myc-tagged HCN2, myc-tagged HCN3, or myc-tagged HCN4 were immunoprecipitated (IP) with either anti-myc antibody (m) or control IgG (c). Western blots (WB) were probed with anti-HCN1 antibody. As a size control the lane at the right (φ) was loaded with a membrane fraction (10 μg of protein) of HCN1-expressing HEK293 cells. The sizes of the HCN1-specific immunosignals are indicated. B, detection of heteromeric HCN1/HCN2 channels in mouse brain. Mouse brain lysates were immunoprecipitated with either anti-HCN2 antibody (AS2) or control IgG (c), blotted, and probed with anti-HCN1 antibody. A specific band of about 125 kDa was recognized only after IP with AS2. The size of the immunosignal is identical to that detected by anti-HCN1 in total brain lysate not subjected to IP (φ, 75 μg of protein). C, detection of heteromeric HCN3/HCN4 and HCN2/HCN4 channels. IPs with anti-myc or control antibody were performed from lysates of HEK293 cells cotransfected with HCN4 and myc-tagged HCN2 or myc-tagged HCN3, followed by immunoblotting with anti-HCN4. φ, membrane fractions (30 μg of protein) of HCN4 transfected HEK293 cells not subjected to IP. D, HCN2 assembles with HCN4 but not with HCN3. After IP with anti-myc antibody a specific immunosignal was observed with the anti-HCN2 antibody in HCN4/HCN2 but not in HCN3/HCN2 coexpressing cells. φ, membrane fractions (10 μg of protein) of HCN2 transfected HEK293 cells not subjected to IP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Immunoblot analysis of HCN1 and HCN2 N-linked glycosylation.

To ensure that cells subjected to measurement contained both subunits we used HCN2-EGFP and HCN3-RFP for this set of experiments. Only cells that revealed both green fluorescence (expression of HCN2) and red fluorescence (expression of HCN3) were analyzed. Fig. 3 shows representative current traces of a HCN2-expressing cell and a cell that coexpresses HCN2/HCN3. In cells cotransfected with HCN2/HCN3 we consistantly observed an about 40% reduction in current density (184 ± 23 pA/pF for HCN2-EGFP (n = 34) versus 105 ± 29 pA/pF for HCN2-EGFP/HCN3-RFP (n = 18)). Values for V 0.5 (HCN2-EGFP: -103 ± 0.9 mV (n = 16); HCN2-EGFP/HCN3-RFP: -99.2 ± 2.3 mV (n = 5)) and τact (HCN2-EGFP: 406 ± 21.3 ms (n = 20); HCN2-EGFP/HCN3-RFP: 498 ± 68.2 ms (n = 8)) were not statistically different between both HCN channel combinations.Fig. 3Inhibitory effect of HCN3 on HCN2 mediated current. Representative whole-cell current traces of HEK293 cells transfected with either HCN2-EGFP alone or with a combination of HCN2-EGFP and HCN3-RFP. Cell capacities were 10 and 9 pF for the HCN2-EGFP and HCN2-EGFP/HCN3-RFP expressing cell, respectively. Currents were evoked by stepping from a holding potential of -40 mV to various test potentials ranging from -140 to -30 mV in 10-mV steps.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)N-Glycosylation Is Required for Surface Membrane Expression of HCN Channels—The experiments shown in Fig. 2 suggested that HCN channels expressed in HEK293 cells exist in two isoforms, a predominant isoform with a molecular mass being in the range of the theoretical molecular mass and a larger isoform with a significantly higher molecular mass. In contrast, the larger isoform was almost exclusively detected in brain lysates. To investigate whether the size difference is due to N-linked glycosylation we treated membrane fractions containing HCN channels with N-glycosidase F (Fig. 4). After incubation with this enzyme antibodies directed against HCN1 (Fig. 4A) or HCN2 (Fig. 4B) only detected the smaller band, whereas the larger band almost completely disappeared. The primary sequence of all four HCN channels contains a conserved consensus site for N-glycosylation in the extracellular loop between S5 and the pore helix. Replacement of the corresponding residue in HCN2 by glutamine (HCN2N380Q) resulted in a channel that migrates at about 100 kDa independent of a treatment with N-glycosidase F verifying that the channel is specifically glycosylated at position 380 (Fig. 4B, last lanes).We next set out to investigate the functional role of glycosylation in HCN channels. HEK293 cells transfected with HCN2N380Q exhibited no current over the whole voltage range in which wild type HCN2 is activated (Fig. 5, A–C). The lack of current in cells transfected with HCN2N380Q could be due to a severe impairment of surface expression or, alternatively, could be caused by altered properties of deglycosylated channels integrated in the cell membrane. To differentiate between these two possibilities we analyzed the subcellular localization of HCN2N380Q-EGFP by confocal microscopy. Unlike HEK293 cells expressing the HCN2-EGFP channel HEK293 cells transfected with HCN2N380Q-EGFP no longer showed labeling of the cell membrane (Fig. 6, A and B). Rather, the mutant protein was diffusely distributed in the intracellular compartment. Similarly, when HEK293 cells expressing HCN2-EGFP were treated with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, cell surface expression of HCN2 was completely prevented (Fig. 6C). This finding indicates that the impairment of cell surface expression of HCN2N380Q-EGFP is not caused by incorrect folding due to the replacement of N380Q but is due to the lack of carbohydrate chains in the protein. When HCN2N380Q-EGFP was coexpressed together with HCN4-RFP the mutant protein was highly enriched in the plasma membrane (Fig. 6D) indicating that HCN4 rescued the wild type phenotype by forming a heteromeric complex. Indeed, the coassembly of HCN4 and HCN2N380Q could be confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 6F). Finally, when HCN2N380Q-EGFP was coexpressed with HCN3-RFP no increase in surface expression was observed (Fig. 6E). The mutant protein again showed intracellular accumulation. Thus, HCN3 is not able to normalize channel trafficking of HCN2N380Q, most likely because it cannot form a stable heteromeric complex with this subunit in the cell membrane.Fig. 5Effect of N-linked glycosylation on whole cell HCN current.

We have previously reported that transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a critical mediator of ALI after intratracheal administration of bleomycin or Escherichia coli endotoxin, at least in part due to effects on lung endothelial and alveolar epithelial permeability. In the present study, we hypothesized that TGF-β1 would also decrease vectorial ion and water transport across the distal lung epithelium. Therefore, we studied the effect of active TGF-β1 on 22Na+ uptake across monolayers of primary rat and human alveolar type II (ATII) cells. TGF-β1 significantly reduced the amiloride-sensitive fraction of 22Na+ uptake and fluid transport across monolayers of both rat and human ATII cells. TGF-β1 also significantly decreased αENaC mRNA and protein expression and inhibited expression of a luciferase reporter downstream of the αENaC promoter in lung epithelial cells. The inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 on sodium uptake and αENaC expression in ATII cells was mediated by activation of the MAPK, ERK1/2. Consistent with the in vitro results, TGF-β1 inhibited the amiloride-sensitive fraction of the distal airway epithelial fluid transport in an in vivo rat model at a dose that was not associated with any change in epithelial protein permeability. These data indicate that increased TGF-β1 activity in the distal airspaces during ALI promotes alveolar edema by reducing distal airway epithelial sodium and fluid clearance. This reduction in sodium and fluid transport is attributable in large part to a reduction in apical membrane αENaC expression mediated through an ERK1/2-dependent inhibition of the αENaC promoter activity.

Acute lung injury (ALI) 1The abbreviations used are: ALI, acute lung injury; ATII, alveolar type II cells; PD, potential difference; ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; ERK, extracellular-regulated protein kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; GRE, glucocorticoid response element; HSC, highly selective cation channels; TGF-β1, transforming growth factor β1; SPD, spontaneous potential difference; TEC, transepithelial current. is a devastating syndrome characterized by flooding of alveolar spaces with a protein-rich exudate that impairs pulmonary gas exchange, leading to arterial hypoxemia and respiratory failure (1Ware L.B. Matthay M.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1334-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (4492) Google Scholar). Epithelial injury can contribute to alveolar flooding, because the epithelial barrier is much less permeable under normal conditions than the endothelial barrier. Injury to alveolar epithelial cells can also disrupt normal epithelial fluid transport, impairing the removal of edema fluid from the alveolar space. Clinical studies have demonstrated that impaired alveolar fluid clearance is a characteristic feature of clinical lung injury (2Ware L.B. Matthay M.A. Am J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 1376-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 3Matthay M.A. Wiener-Kronish J.P. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1990; 142: 1250-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms for this decrease in epithelial fluid transport have not been well worked out. The removal of edema fluid from the airspaces occurs via an active transport-dependent sodium concentration gradient across the distal lung epithelium. The rate-limiting step in the transport of fluid across the lung epithelium is the movement of sodium and chloride across the apical plasma membrane, specifically the movement of sodium through amiloride-sensitive and -insensitive channels (4Matthay M.A. Folkesson H.G. Clerici C. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 569-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Among the sodium channels at the apical membrane of lung epithelial cells, amiloride-sensitive channels represent 50–60% of the sodium transport, particularly in rat and human lungs (4Matthay M.A. Folkesson H.G. Clerici C. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 569-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Molecular identification of the proteins involved in amiloride-sensitive sodium flux achieved in the last few years revealed that three homologous subunits, α-, β-, and γENaC, correspond to the pore-forming subunits that form a high affinity amiloride-sensitive sodium-selective pore (5Canessa C.M. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1682-C1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The critical role of αENaC in the absorption of salt and fluid by lung epithelial cells has been confirmed by the generation of αEnaC knockout mice. Knockout neonates develop respiratory distress syndrome and die within 48 h of birth from failure to clear their lungs of fluid (6Hummler E. Barker P. Gatzy J. Beermann F. Verdumo C. Schmidt A. Boucher R. Rossier B.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). In contrast, β- and γENaC knockout mice were able to clear fluid from the lungs at birth, although at a slower rate than in the wild-type control (7McDonald F.J. Yang B. Hrstka R.F. Drummond H.A. Tarr D.E. McCray Jr., P.B. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. Williamson R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1727-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 8Barker P.M. Nguyen M.S. Gatzy J.T. Grubb B. Norman H. Hummler E. Rossier B. Boucher R.C. Koller B. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1634-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The absence of intact distal lung sodium and fluid transport has also been associated with worse respiratory failure and higher mortality in patients with acute lung injury (3Matthay M.A. Wiener-Kronish J.P. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1990; 142: 1250-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar); however, the mechanisms for the regulation of the distal airspace lung sodium and fluid transport in acute lung injury are not fully understood. The cytokine transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) plays a critical role in the resolution of tissue injury in multiple organs, including the lung (9Shull M.M. Ormsby I. Kier A.B. Pawlowski S. Diebold R.J. Yin M. Allen R. Sidman C. Proetzel G. Calvin D. Annunziata N. Doetschman T. Nature. 1992; 359: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar). Following acute lung injury, TGF-β1 has been most thoroughly evaluated during the late phases of tissue repair, where it plays a critical role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis (10Giri S.N. Hyde D.M. Hollinger M.A. Thorax. 1993; 48: 959-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 11Broekelmann T.J. Limper A.H. Colby T.V. McDonald J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6642-6646Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). However, in a recent study evaluating global patterns of gene expression following bleomycin-induced lung injury, we found that the expression levels of several TGF-β1-inducible genes were dramatically increased as early as 2 days after the induction of injury (12Kaminski N. Allard J.D. Pittet J.F. Zuo F. Griffiths M.J. Morris D. Huang X. Sheppard D. Heller R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1778-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), a time point that precedes the maximal increase in alveolar flooding in this experimental model. Furthermore, the TGF-β1-inducible gene, procollagen III, is one of the earliest predictors of the severity of acute lung injury in humans (13Chesnutt A.N. Matthay M.A. Tibayan F.A. Clark J.G. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1997; 156: 840-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 14Clark J.G. Milberg J.A. Steinberg K.P. Hudson L.D. Ann. Intern. Med. 1995; 122: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In vitro, TGF-β1 directly increases the permeability of endothelial monolayers (15Hurst V.I. Goldberg P.L. Minnear F.L. Heimark R.L. Vincent P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L582-L595PubMed Google Scholar). Using mouse models of bleomycin-induced and E. coli-induced acute lung injury, we previously found that active TGF-β1 is a critical mediator of alveolar edema (19Fang X. Ishigaki M. Song Y. Hirsch J. Matthay M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 167 (abstr.): 564Google Scholar). In vitro, TGF-β1 increased permeability across epithelial and endothelial monolayers, suggesting mechanisms by which this cytokine could contribute to alveolar flooding. In addition to its known effect on the protein permeability across the lung endothelial and epithelial barriers, TGF-β1 was shown to affect the ion channels at the apical membrane of the alveolar epithelium. For example, using a patch clamp technique, a recent study indicated that TGF-β1 reduced the activity of highly selective cation (HSC) channels at the apical membrane of ATII cells (16Chen X.J. Jain L. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 165 (abstr.): 751Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying these effects and their in vivo relevance were not examined. HSC channels are formed by a combination of the three ENaC subunits when coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes (17McNicholas C.M. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that activation of a TGF-β1-dependent signaling pathway would decrease basal vectorial fluid transport across the lung epithelium by affecting expression or function of the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel ENaC in lung epithelial cells. We now report that TGF-β1 does indeed inhibit fluid alveolar epithelial sodium and fluid transport, both in vitro and in vivo, and that this effect is due to an ERK1/2-dependent repression of αENaC mRNA and protein expression, resulting in a marked reduction in the steady state level of αENaC at the apical surface of polarized alveolar epithelial cells. Primary cultures of rat and human alveolar epithelial cells were used for the in vitro studies. Rat ATII cells were isolated by elastase digestion and selective adhesion plating on rat immunoglobulin G, as previously reported (18Pittet J.F. Griffiths M.J. Geiser T. Kaminski N. Dalton S.L. Huang X. Brown L.A. Gotwals P.J. Koteliansky V.E. Matthay M.A. Sheppard D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1537-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Rat ATII cells were plated on 6.5-mm polycarbonate transwells (Corning Costar Co., Cambridge, MA) with a 0.4-μm pore size. Cells were seeded at a concentration of 1.5 × 106 cells/cm2 in DMEM-H21 medium containing 10% low endotoxin fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin, and streptomycin and kept at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 environment. 24 h later, nonadherent epithelial cells were removed by washing with PBS, and fresh medium was added to the lower compartments of the transwells, thus maintaining the ATII cell monolayers with an air-liquid interface on their apical side. After 72–96 h, cells form confluent monolayers that reach a transepithelial electrical resistance greater than 1500 ohms·cm2. Following approval of the University of California, San Francisco, Committee on Human Research, human alveolar epithelial type II cells were isolated using a modification of methods previously described (19Fang X. Ishigaki M. Song Y. Hirsch J. Matthay M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 167 (abstr.): 564Google Scholar). Briefly, alveolar type II cells were isolated from human lungs that were not used by the Northern California Transplant Donor Network. Our studies indicate that these lungs were in good condition, both physiologically and pathologically (20Ware L. Wang Y. Fang X. Warnock M. Sakuma T. Hall T. Matthay M. Lancet. 2002; 360: 619-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Cells were isolated after the lungs had been preserved for 4–8 h at 4 °C. A lobe of the human lung was selected that had no evidence of injury on the preharvest chest radiograph, could be normally inflated, and had no area of consolidation or hemorrhage. The pulmonary artery for this segment was perfused with 37 °C PBS solution, and the distal airspaces of a segmental bronchus were lavaged 10 times with 37 °C Ca2+-, Mg2+-free PBS solution containing 0.5 mm EGTA and EDTA. 60–90 ml of pancreatic porcine elastase (8 units/ml) diluted in a Ca2+-, Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution was instilled into the airspaces of 50 g of the chosen segment of lung tissue. The lung was incubated in a water bath for 30 min at 37 °C and minced finely in the presence of fetal bovine serum and DNase I (500 μg/ml). The cell-rich fraction was filtered sequentially through one-layer gauze, two-layer gauze, and 150- and 30-μm nylon meshes. The cell suspension was then layered onto a discontinuous Percoll density gradient 1.04–1.09 g/ml solution and centrifuged at 400 × g for 20 min to remove red blood cells. The cells that accumulated at the interface of the solution and the Percoll were a mixture of type II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages. These cells were recovered by centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing magnetic beads coated with an anti-CD-14 antibody (Dynabeads M/450 CD14; Dynal, Oslo, Norway) at 4 °C for 40 min under constant mixing to eliminate macrophages. The cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. The purity of isolated human alveolar type II cells was checked by Papanicolaou staining or by staining with anti-human type II cell antibody (obtained from Leland Dobbs, University of California, San Francisco), and their purity has been more than 90% (data not shown). Human alveolar type II cells were seeded on collagen I-coated transwells at a density of 1 × 106 cells/cm2. Five days after the cells were seeded, the monolayer developed a transepithelial electrical resistance greater than 1500 ohms·cm2, as reported for rat ATII cell monolayers. All cell culture media were prepared by the University of California, San Francisco, Cell Culture Facility using deionized water and analytical grade reagents. Amiloride, ouabain, and protease inhibitors were obtained from Sigma. Human TGF-β1 was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). 22Na was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences at a specific activity of 582 mCi/mg and at a concentration of 1 mCi/ml. Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin and streptavidin-agarose beads were obtained from Pierce. The MAPK inhibitors PD98059 (an inhibitor of the kinase upstream of ERK1/2), SB203580 (an inhibitor of the α- and β-isoforms of p38 MAPK), and SP600125 (a reversible inhibitor of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase), were obtained from Calbiochem. All of these MAPK inhibitors have been shown to block their respective MAPK in lung epithelial cells (21Hashimoto S. Matsumoto K. Gon Y. Nakayama T. Takeshita I. Horie T. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 159: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 22Furuichi S. Hashimoto S. Gon Y. Matsumoto K. Horie T.

Mifepristone (RU486), a known glucocorticoid antagonist, has been purchased from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Monoclonal antibody against the three isoforms of TGF-β was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Mouse monoclonal actin antibody was obtained from Chemicon international (Temecula, CA), and antibodies recognizing ERK and phospho-ERK were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Polyclonal and affinity-purified αENaC antibodies were provided by C. Canessa (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT). Antibodies and phosphoantibodies for MAPKs were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Cationic liposomes (Fugene 6) were obtained from Roche Applied Science, and the chemiluminescence kit was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The following three plasmids were a kind gift from A. Dagenais (Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada): (a) a plasmid (pGL-3) containing the luciferase gene under the control of the full-length murine αENaC promoter (pGL3-basic/αmENaC promoter), (b) a plasmid (pGL-3) containing the luciferase gene under the control of a murine αENaC promoter with a deletion in the glucocorticoid regulatory element (GRE) (pGL3-basic/αmENaC del AVR-XhO I promoter), and (c) a plasmid (pGL-3) containing the luciferase gene under the control of the full-length murine αENaC promoter and containing a SV40 enhancer. Protein concentration of cell lysates was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with BSA as the standard. Total RNA from rat ATII cells was extracted by a modification of the guanidinium-phenol technique (24Dagenais A. Denis C. Vives M.F. Girouard S. Masse C. Nguyen T. Yamagata T. Grygorczyk C. Kothary R. Berthiaume Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L217-L230Google Scholar). 10 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to Gene-Screen nylon membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by overnight blotting with a 10× saline/sodium citrate solution. Hybridization was performed in a solution containing 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 7% SDS (w/v), and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8. The nylon membranes were hybridized successively with αENaC and 18 S rRNA cDNA probes labeled with [32P]dCTP. αENaC mRNA was detected with a 764-bp mouse α-ENaC cDNA (His445 to the stop codon), which has a high homology with rat αENaC cDNA (24Dagenais A. Denis C. Vives M.F. Girouard S. Masse C. Nguyen T. Yamagata T. Grygorczyk C. Kothary R. Berthiaume Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L217-L230Google Scholar). For quantitative studies, α-ENaC mRNA was normalized to 18 S rRNA expression to ensure that the same amount of RNA was present in each lane. The 18 S rRNA probe consisted of a 640-bp cDNA fragment that has been amplified by reverse transcription-PCR between nucleotides 852 and 1492 of the rat 18 S rRNA sequence (24Dagenais A. Denis C. Vives M.F. Girouard S. Masse C. Nguyen T. Yamagata T. Grygorczyk C. Kothary R. Berthiaume Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L217-L230Google Scholar). After hybridization, the membranes were washed successively for 30 min with 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 0.1% (w/v) SDS; 40 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 0.1% (w/v) SDS; and 40 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 1% (w/v) SDS. The blots were exposed either to Kodak X-AR film, using an intensifying screen, or to a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) for densitometric analysis. For reproducibility and statistical reasons, Northern blotting was repeated several times with RNA extracted from cells isolated from different animals. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (25Pittet J.F. Lu L.N. Morris D.G. Modelska K. Welch W.J. Carey H.V. Roux J. Matthay M.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6301-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). After equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane and separated in 10% SDS-PAGE gels, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and αENaC was detected using an affinity-purified antibody at a 1:1,000 dilution and horseradish peroxidase-GAR at a 1:10,000 dilution. Actin, MAPKs, and phospho-MAPKs were detected with commercially available antibodies (mouse monoclonal actin antibody at a dilution of 1:1,000, MAPK and P-MAPK antibodies at a dilution of 1:500, and horseradish peroxidase-GAM at a 1:2,000 dilution). The protein bands were visualized using chemiluminescence. Quantification was done using a digital image analysis system (ChemiImager; Alpha Innotech). Biotinylation and recovery of apical membrane proteins were performed as previously described (26De La Rosa D.A. Li H. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 427-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) using Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin. The protein concentration of the lysates was determined using the BCA kit. Streptavidin-agarose beads were added to equal amounts of total protein to recover the biotinylated proteins. The amount of added beads was adjusted to ensure a complete recovery of biotinylated proteins from lysates. Biotinylated proteins were eluted from the beads by heating to 90 °C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Transepithelial resistance (Rt ; kiloohms·cm2) and spontaneous potential difference (SPD; mV, apical side as reference) were measured using the Millicell-ERS (Millipore). Transepithelial current (I sc; μA/cm2) was calculated from the relationship I sc = SPD/Rt (Ohm's law). The effect of TGF-β1 (0.1–10 ng/ml for 24 h) or its vehicle on bioelectric properties of ATII cell monolayer was evaluated on day 4 in culture. Because it has previously been shown that TGF-β1 can induce a polarized regulation of its dependent genes in lung epithelial cells (27Wang A. Cohen D.S. Palmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15598-15601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), TGF-β1 was also added only to either the apical or basolateral side of the cell monolayer. 22Na Uptake—The activity of sodium transport pathway on the apical membrane of rat and human ATII cells was determined by unidirectional tracer uptake measurement using the technique described by Mairbaurl et al. (28Mairbaurl H. Mayer K. Kim K.J. Borok Z. Bartsch P. Crandall E.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L659-L665PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after exposure to TGF-β1 or to its vehicle on both sides of the transwell, the cells were washed two times with washing medium (150 mm NaCl and 2 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at 37 °C and were equilibrated to the flux medium for 10 min. The flux medium was composed of 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. After equilibration, the medium was replaced with fresh flux medium containing 22Na at a final activity of 5 μCi/ml and ouabain (3 × 10–3m). After 6 min, cell monolayers were washed four times by overflow with cold washing medium to eliminate 22Na not taken up by the cells and to stop further uptake. We verified that the last wash solution did not contain any radioactivity. The cells were then lysed with 0.1% NaOH, and the radioactivity in the lysate was measured in a β-counter. Protein determination was used for normalization of the results. Control experiments have shown that the tracer uptake was linear over a period range of 10 min. Thus, only one 6-min time point was taken. All fluxes were measured in triplicate. Fluid Transport—Fluid transport across rat and human ATII cell monolayers was measured as described previously (29Fang X. Song Y. Hirsch J. Ishigaki M. Matthay M. FASEB J. 2003; 17 (abstr.): 87Google Scholar). Briefly, after rat ATII cells were plated on transwells and grown in an air-liquid interface for 24 h, 150 μl of medium containing 0.5 μCi/ml 131I-albumin was added to the apical side of the monolayers, and the transwells were placed in a humidified tent. 5 min later, 20 μl of medium containing 131I-albumin were sampled from the apical side (initial sample). Transwells were then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with 100% humidity in a CO2 incubator. Medium in upper and lower compartments of the transwell were kept at the same level to avoid any effect of the hydrostatic pressure. 24 h later, a second 20-μl sample was removed from the apical side of the monolayers (final sample). Collected samples were weighed and counted in a γ-counter (Beckman). Fluid absorption was calculated as in our prior in vivo studies (30Sartori C. Fang X. McGraw D.W. Koch P. Snider M.E. Folkesson H.G. Matthay M.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 93: 1875-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fluid absorption = (1 – radioactivity in the initial sample/radioactivity in the final sample) × 100%. In pilot experiments, we were able to detect a 2-fold increase in the fluid transport across these ATII cell monolayers after c-AMP stimulation (10–5m forskolin plus 4 × 10–4m isobutylmethylxanthine) and a 50% inhibition of the fluid transport after exposure to amiloride (10–4m) (data not shown). Rat ATII cells were transiently transfected with one of the following plasmids: (a) a plasmid (pGL-3) containing the luciferase gene under the control of the full-length murine αENaC promoter and containing a SV40 enhancer that induces a stronger expression the promoter (pGL3-enhancer/αmENaC promoter); (b) a plasmid (pGL-3) containing the luciferase gene under the control of the murine αENaC promoter (pGL3-basic/αmENaC promoter), or (c) a plasmid (pGL-3) containing the luciferase gene under the control of a murine αENaC promoter with a deletion in the GRE (pGL3-basic/αmENaC del AVR-XhO I promoter). After rat ATII cells were plated on transwells (5 × 105 cells/transwell) and grown in an air-liquid interface for 24 h, cells were transfected in triplicate by incubation with cationic liposomes (6 μl of Fugene 6, 1 μg of DNA per transwell). 48 h later, the cells were exposed to TGF-β1 or its vehicle for 8 or 24 h. In some experiments, an inhibitor of ERK 1/2, JNK or p38 MAPK, or dexamethasone (100 nm) with or without mifepristone (RU486) (5 μm), a known glucocorticoid antagonist, was added to the cell medium 1 h prior to exposure to TGF-β1 or its vehicle. Then cell extracts were prepared and analyzed for luciferase activity according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI) using a luminometer. Luciferase activity was corrected for total cellular protein and reported as a percentage of the control cells (cells that were transfected but not treated with TGF-β1). Cells were also co-transfected with a β-galactosidase plasmid, and β-galactosidase activity was determined in order to verify that the efficiency of transfection was comparable within and between experiments. Cell viability after exposure to different experimental conditions was measured by an Alamar Blue assay. Cell media were replaced by medium containing 10% Alamar Blue and placed at 37 °C in the cell incubator for 2–3 h. The medium was then collected and read on a plate reader at 530 nm. This protocol was approved by the University of California, San Francisco, Committee on Animal Research. Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 300–350 g were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine (90 and 10 mg/kg, respectively). Rats were placed supine in a declined position, and a curved needle was placed into the trachea under direct vision. TGF-β1 or its vehicle was instilled into the trachea through a feeding catheter. After the procedure, supplemental oxygen was given until the rats were fully awake. The first series of experiments was designed to measure the effect of active recombinant TGF-β1 or its vehicle (n = 4 in each group) on the lung endothelial and alveolar epithelial permeability to protein. In the second series of experiments, distal airspace fluid clearance was measured 24 h after the intratracheal administration of TGF-β1 or its vehicle (n = 11 in the TGF-β1 group, and n = 8 in the control group), as we have done before (31Frank J.A. Gutierrez J.A. Jones K.D. Allen L. Dobbs L. Matthay M.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 165: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Pilot experiments indicated that active TGF-β1 instilled into the airspaces could affect lung epithelial fluid clearance at doses that did not have any effect on the protein permeability across this barrier. In contrast, higher doses caused both a decrease in lung epithelial fluid transport and increase in lung endothelial and epithelial permeability to protein. Thus, the dose of active TGF-β1 chosen for these studies was low enough (250 ng) so that we could study the effect of active TGF-β1 on the in vivo vectorial lung epithelial fluid transport without the confounding effect of increase in epithelial permeability to protein. To assess the validity of our in vivo measurement of the lung endothelial and alveolar epithelial permeability to protein, we used the intratracheal instillation of IL-1β (50 ng) as a positive control.

Recently it was found that BTHS patients exhibit a profound cardiolipin deficiency although the biosynthetic capacity to synthesize this lipid from its precursor phosphatidylglycerol is entirely normal. Like BTHS patients, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, in which the yeast orthologue of the human TAZ gene has been disrupted, exhibits an abnormal cardiolipin profile as determined by tandem mass spectrometry. Additionally, this yeast strain grows poorly on non-fermentable carbon sources. We have used both properties of this yeast disruptant as a read-out system to test the physiological functionality of each of 12 different splice variants that have been reported for the human TAZ gene. Our results demonstrate that only the splice variant lacking exon 5 was able to complement the retarded growth of the yeast disruptant on selective plates and restore the cardiolipin profile to the wild type pattern. We conclude that this splice variant most likely represents the only physiologically important mRNA, at least with regard to cardiolipin metabolism.

Barth syndrome (BTHS 1The abbreviations used are: BTHS, Barth syndrome; HTAZ, human tafazzin; YTAZ, yeast tafazzin.; MIM 302060) is an X-linked recessive disorder, which clinically is characterized by cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, growth retardation, and neutropenia. Additional laboratory findings include intermittent lactic acidemia, low blood cholesterol, and increased urinary excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid, 3-methylglutaric acid, and 2-ethylhydracrylic acid (1Barth P.G. Wanders R.J. Vreken P. Janssen E.A. Lam J. Baas F. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1999; 22: 555-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Moreover, mitochondria of BTHS patients have an abnormal ultrastructure, and several different respiratory chain defects in muscle and fibroblasts have been reported (1Barth P.G. Wanders R.J. Vreken P. Janssen E.A. Lam J. Baas F. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1999; 22: 555-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The disease is often fatal in childhood because of cardiac failure or sepsis. The clinical expression of the disease, however, is quite variable in severity and may show profound intrafamilial variability (1Barth P.G. Wanders R.J. Vreken P. Janssen E.A. Lam J. Baas F. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1999; 22: 555-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 2Orstavik K.H. Orstavik R.E. Naumova A.K. D'Adamo P. Gedeon A. Bolhuis P.A. Barth P.G. Toniolo D. Am. J. Hum.

The TAZ gene (previously known as G4.5), which is mutated in this disorder, is located on Xq28 (4Bolhuis P.A. Hensels G.W. Hulsebos T.J. Baas F. Barth P.G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 48: 481-485PubMed Google Scholar) and is postulated to contain 11 exons based on the alignment of cDNA sequences with genomic data (5Bione S. D'Adamo P. Maestrini E. Gedeon A.K. Bolhuis P.A. Toniolo D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). At the transcriptional level, six different mRNAs have been identified containing different combinations of exons 5–7 because of differential splicing. Two variants containing either all three exons or lacking exon 5 are consistently more abundant in most tissues examined (5Bione S. D'Adamo P. Maestrini E. Gedeon A.K. Bolhuis P.A. Toniolo D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing also has been reported to produce two different 5′-ends of the transcripts leading to two possible translation initiation sites (1st ATG at position 1–3 and 2nd ATG at position 277–279 of the full-length open reading frame). As a consequence, there are at least 12 possible mRNAs, which are present in different amounts in different tissues (5Bione S. D'Adamo P. Maestrini E. Gedeon A.K. Bolhuis P.A. Toniolo D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Whether these splice variants all give rise to functional proteins awaited the identification of the physiological function of the encoded tafazzins, which has not been established so far. In 1997, Neuwald (6Neuwald A.F. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R465-R466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) hypothesized that tafazzins share homology with a family of acyltransferases that are involved in phospholipid metabolism. In line with this hypothesis, our group found abnormal levels of cardiolipin and phosphatidylglycerol in BTHS cells, whereas all other phospholipid classes are normal (7Vreken P. Valianpour F. Nijtmans L.G. Grivell L.A. Plecko B. Wanders R.J. Barth P.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Cardiolipin is an acidic polyglycerophospholipid, which is almost exclusively found in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is synthesized from phosphatidylglycerol (8Hatch G.M. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 1: 33-41PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of cardiolipin is shown in Fig. 1. After synthesis of cardiolipin, its fatty acid side chains are remodeled by a deacylation-reacylation cycle to obtain different cardiolipin species, which contain mainly mono-unsaturated and di-unsaturated chains of 16–18 carbons in length (8Hatch G.M. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 1: 33-41PubMed Google Scholar). Cardiolipin is required for optimal functioning of the respiratory chain complexes and several other mitochondrial inner membrane proteins, including the ATP/ADP transporter and the carnitine acylcarnitine translocase (9Koshkin V. Greenberg M.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 687-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 10Kadenbach B. Mende P. Kolbe H.V. Stipani I. Palmieri F.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 155: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Investigations in cultured skin fibroblasts of BTHS patients showed that the rate of biosynthesis of cardiolipin from phosphatidylglycerol is normal but that the cardiolipin pool size is considerably reduced as compared with control cells. Furthermore, the incorporation of linoleic acid, which is the characteristic acyl side chain found in mammalian cardiolipin, into both phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin was significantly reduced (7Vreken P. Valianpour F. Nijtmans L.G. Grivell L.A. Plecko B. Wanders R.J. Barth P.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the TAZ gene encodes one or more acyltransferases involved in the remodeling of cardiolipin or its precursors. Direct evidence that the tafazzins are involved in cardiolipin metabolism was unavailable until now. DNA Manipulations—The 12 TAZ splice variants were amplified by PCR from primary human fibroblast cDNA using the following primers: two KpnI-tagged forward primers 5′-GGT ACC ATG CCT CTG CAC GTG AAG T-3′ and 5′-GGT ACC ATG GAC GAC CCT CAT CTC TG-3′ for the first (position 1–3) and the second (position 277–279) translation initiation site, respectively, and a SalI-tagged reverse primer 5′-GTC GAC CTA TCT CCC AGG CTG GAG GTG-3′. As described previously (5Bione S. D'Adamo P. Maestrini E. Gedeon A.K. Bolhuis P.A. Toniolo D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), five PCR products were observed on agarose gel, which subsequently were subcloned in the pGEM-T vector (Promega). Inserts were sequenced to exclude sequence errors introduced by Taq polymerase, and the different splice variants were cloned downstream of the yeast PGK promoter into the KpnI and SalI sites of the yeast expression vector pYPGK18. This vector is derived from the pHVXII vector (13Swiegers J.H. Vaz F.M. Pretorius I.S. Wanders R.J. Bauer F.F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 210: 19-23PubMed Google Scholar) after replacing the original multiple cloning site by that of pUC18. Yeast tafazzin (YTAZ) was amplified from W303 genomic DNA using a KpnI-tagged forward primer 5′-GGT ACC ATG TCT TTT AGG GAT GTC CTA G-3′ and a SalI-tagged reverse primer 5′-GTC GAC TCA ATC ATC CTT ACC CTT TGG-3′ and cloned into the KpnI and SalI sites of pYPGK18. The insert was sequenced to exclude sequence errors. Generation of the YPR140w Disruptant—To construct the Δtaz deletion mutant, the entire YPR140w open reading frame was replaced by the kanMX4 marker gene (14Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The PCR-derived construct for disruption consisted of the kanMX4 gene flanked by short regions of homology corresponding to the YPR140w 3′ and 5′ non-coding regions. pKan was used as template with the YPR140w primers (5′-ATG TCT TTT AGG GAT GTC CTA GAA AGA GGA GAT GAA TTT TTA GAA GCC TAG CGT ACG CTG CAG GTC GAC-3′ and 5′-TCA ATC ATC CTT ACC CTT TGG TTT ACC CTC TGG AGG CAG AAA CTT TTG ATC GAT GAA TTC GAG CTC G-3′). The resulting PCR fragments were introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild type W303 strain (15Mashkevich G. Repetto B. Glerum D.M. Jin C. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14356-14364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). G418-resistant clones were selected by growth on YPD plates containing G418 (200 mg/liter) (14Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Expression of TAZ Splice Variants and Complementation Analysis—The different pYPGK18 constructs were transformed to Δtaz using the lithium acetate procedure (16Becker D.M. Guarente L. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1991: 182-187Google Scholar). Transformed yeast cells were grown on minimal glucose medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose) at 30 °C and harvested in mid-exponential phase. For the complementation analysis, transformants were streaked on rich ethanol plates (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% agar, and 2% ethanol) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 week. For cardiolipin and immunoblot analysis, spheroplasts were prepared using zymolyase according to Franzusoff et al. (17Franzusoff A. Rothblatt J. Schekman R. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1991: 662-674Google Scholar) and lysed in a 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 140 mm NaCl and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After sonication, protein determination was performed by the method of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Cardiolipin Analysis by High Pressure Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry—Lipids were extracted using a modification of the method of Folch et al. (19Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.4 nmol of CL(C14: 0)4 (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) was added to the equivalent of 1 mg of protein in a total volume of 1 ml of distilled water, and this aqueous phase was extracted twice with 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v) followed by centrifugation at 1000 × g. The combined organic phases were evaporated under a nitrogen stream, and the residue was taken up in 100 μl of chloroform/methanol/water (50:45:5 v/v/v) containing 2.5 ml/liter NH4OH. Five microliters of this lipid extract was injected into a straight-phase high pressure liquid chromatography system, and cardiolipin analysis was performed by on-line electrospray tandem mass spectrometry as described previously (20Valianpour F. Wanders R.J. Barth P.G. Overmars H. van Gennip A.H. Clin. Chem. 2002; 48: 1390-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). By using bovine heart monolysocardiolipin (consisting mostly of trilinoleylmonolysocardiolipin, Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), we determined that with this method monolysocardiolipins elute about 0.2 min later than the cardiolipins. For the acquisition of the cardiolipin spectra of both cardiolipins and monolysocardiolipins, a continuous negative scan was made from 400 to 1000 m/z in a time window of 2.5 min, during which both types of compounds elute from the column. In a separate analysis, using the same extract, single ion monitoring was used to quantify selected monolysocardiolipins and cardiolipins. The area of each (monolyso)cardiolipin peak (A (ml)cl) and that of the added internal standard (A IS) was quantified using MassLynx 3.3 (Micromass, Manchester, UK). The amount of (monolyso)cardiolipins was calculated by the formula: (A (ml)cl/A IS) × 0.4 nmol (the amount of internal standard added). These data were used to calculate the relative cardiolipin and monolysocardiolipin levels (Fig. 4) in comparison to wild type levels. Tafazzin Antibody Generation—The portion of the TAZ cDNA corresponding to exons 8–11 was amplified by PCR from human fibroblast cDNA using Taq polymerase and the following primers: a BamHI-tagged forward primer 5′-GGA TCC ATC GGG CGC CTG ATT GCT GAG-3′ and an HindIII-tagged reverse primer 5′-AAG CTT CTA TCT CCC AGG CTG GAG GTG-3′. The PCR product was cloned downstream of the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible PTAC promoter into the BamHI and HindIII sites of the bacterial expression vector pMAL-C2X, to express the last 98 amino acids of tafazzin fused to maltose-binding protein. This protein sequence is present in all of the protein products of the putative splice variants of the TAZ gene. The insert was sequenced to exclude sequence errors introduced by PCR, after which the construct was transformed to the Escherichia coli strain BL21. Protein expression, purification, and antibody generation was performed as described previously (21Vaz F.M. Ofman R. Westinga K. Back J.W. Wanders R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33512-33517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For affinity purification of the crude antiserum, the same tafazzin fragment was cloned downstream of the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible PTAC promoter into the BamHI and HindIII sites of the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T in order to express it as a fusion to glutathione S-transferase. This protein was expressed, purified, coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and used for affinity purification of the α-TAZ antibodies as described previously (22Hogenboom S. Romeijn G.J. Houten S.M. Baes M. Wanders R.J. Waterham H.R. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 90-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This resulting antibody solution was diluted 1:100 for immunoblotting, which was performed according to Vaz et al. (21Vaz F.M. Ofman R. Westinga K. Back J.W. Wanders R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33512-33517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To investigate the functionality of the different human splice variants of the TAZ gene, we have generated a strain of S. cerevisiae in which the yeast orthologue of the TAZ gene, YPR140w, has been disrupted. This yeast deletion strain is unable to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources, such as ethanol, at 37 °C. As in BTHS patients (7Vreken P. Valianpour F. Nijtmans L.G. Grivell L.A. Plecko B. Wanders R.J. Barth P.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 20Valianpour F. Wanders R.J. Barth P.G. Overmars H. van Gennip A.H. Clin. Chem. 2002; 48: 1390-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), Δtaz displays an abnormal cardiolipin profile. Fig. 2A shows the cardiolipin profile of wild type W303 strain and that of the disruption mutant Δtaz. In each cardiolipin cluster, the peak with the lowest m/z represents tetra-unsaturated cardiolipin. For example, the ion with m/z 727.5 represents a cardiolipin containing four oleic acid (C18:1) acyl side chains. To interpret the cardiolipin spectra shown in Fig. 2, one should keep in mind that cardiolipins are measured as doubly charged ions, which implies that the mass over charge ratio (m/z) corresponds to half of the actual cardiolipin mass and that the distance between the molecular ion peak and its first isotope peak is 0.5 Da. Therefore, the next cardiolipin within the 727.5 cluster has an m/z of 728.5. This cardiolipin has one unsaturation less and represents tri-unsaturated cardiolipin with three oleic acid (C18:1) acyl side chain and one stearic acid (C18:0) acyl side chain. The next cluster, which contains an ion with m/z 713.5, consists of cardiolipins with one C16 and three C18 fatty acyl side chains, where m/z 713.5 represents cardiolipin containing one palmitoleic acid (C16:1) and three oleic acid (C18:1) acyl side chains. Fig. 2A shows that, as observed for BTHS, tetra-unsaturated cardiolipin species are either completely absent (m/z 727.5) or present in decreased levels (m/z 685.5, 699.5, and 713.5) indicating that this yeast disruptant is a good model for BTHS. In addition, there is accumulation of monolysocardiolipins (m/z 567.5/ 568.5 and 581.5/582.5), which thus far has not been observed in BTHS. Because, with regard to the cardiolipin profile, the yeast phenotype is similar to that observed in BTHS patients, we used this yeast system to investigate the functionality of the different TAZ mRNA splice variants by complementation analysis. Table I gives a description of the various splice variants that were tested and the abbreviations used for them. Yeast tafazzin (YTAZ) was used as a positive control for the complementation analysis. All constructs were transformed to Δtaz, including pYPGK18 without insert, which was used as a negative control. Immunoblot analysis using an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody that we raised against the invariant C-terminal part of human tafazzin confirmed that the splice variants were correctly expressed (Fig. 3A).Table IComposition of the different splice variants and used abbreviationsSplice variantAbbreviationFirst initiation siteSecond initiation siteFull lengthHTAZ-1stATG-fullHTAZ-2ndATG-fullLacking exon 5HTAZ-1stATG-ex5HTAZ-2ndATG-ex5Lacking exon 7HTAZ-1stATG-ex7HTAZ-2ndATG-ex7Lacking exons 5 and 7HTAZ-1stATG-ex5,7HTAZ-2ndATG-ex5,7Lacking exons 6 and 7HTAZ-1stATG-ex6,7HTAZ-2ndATG-ex6,7Lacking exons 5-7HTAZ-1stATG-ex5,6,7HTAZ-2ndATG-ex5,6,7 Open table in a new tab First, it was determined whether the transformants had regained the ability to grow on ethanol plates at 37 °C. Fig. 3B shows that only the expression of YTAZ and HTAZ-1stATG-ex5 was able to complement the growth phenotype, whereas transformants expressing the other splice variants remained retarded in growth similar to Δtaz. Second, cardiolipin analysis was performed in cell homogenates, and this showed that all transformants had the same cardiolipin profile as Δtaz, except for those expressing YTAZ and HTAZ-1stATG-ex5 and HTAZ-1stATG-full, which show either a complete or partial normalization of the cardiolipin profile (Fig. 2). By virtue of the added internal standard, the amount of the most abundant monolysocardiolipins (m/z 568.5 and 582.5) and that of the tetra-unsaturated cardiolipins containing C16 and C18 acyl side chains (m/z 685.5, 699.5, 713.5, and 727.5) was determined and related to the levels found in the wild type strain (Fig. 4). The quantitative results presented in this figure confirm that the growth-phenotype correction also corresponds to a complete restoration of the cardiolipin profile for YTAZ and HTAZ-1stATG-ex5. Interestingly, in contrast to these two latter strains, the transformant expressing HTAZ-1stATG-full displays a partial restoration of the cardiolipin profile, i.e. cardiolipin species containing a majority of C18 fatty acids (cardiolipin clusters m/z 727.5 and m/z 713.5) are still deficient, whereas cardiolipin species containing mostly C16 fatty acids (m/z 699.5 and m/z 685.5) display a pattern similar to that of wild type (Fig. 4A). This partial restoration of the cardiolipin profile is also reflected by the monolysocardiolipin levels, which in the transformants expressing YTAZ or HTAZ-1stATG-ex5 are comparable with wild type but in the transformant expressing HTAZ-1stATG-full are still elevated (Fig. 4B). Taken together, our results suggest that only HTAZ-1stATG-ex5 and HTAZ-1stATG-full are functional splice variants, which are directly involved in cardiolipin metabolism. There are several reasons, however, to question whether HTAZ-1stATG-full really represents a physiologically relevant mRNA. Fig. 5 shows a ClustalW alignment of amino acids residues 94–172 of HTAZ-1stATG-full with tafazzin orthologues of very distinct organisms, including mammals, flies, yeast, and plant. This sequence region includes amino acids residues 123–153 encoded by exon 5. Note that none of the orthologous sequences have any sequence homology to this region, whereas in the sequences flanking the amino acids encoded by exon 5 a high homology with all orthologues is observed (Fig. 5). This is also true at the genomic DNA level, as concluded from translated blast analysis (tBlastn) using the full-length human tafazzin as query in the mouse and rat genome data base, which identifies all exons, except exon 5 (not shown). This lack of homology with both related and distant organisms in conjunction with the inability of HTAZ-1stATG-full to restore the growth phenotype on selective conditions and the partial restoration of the cardiolipin profile strongly suggests that exon 5, the existence of which was postulated on the basis of its presence in some human mRNA splice variants, is a result of aberrant splicing and in fact does not lead to a functionally relevant protein. This is also supported by the observation that of the 42 different mutations that currently have been identified in the TAZ gene, no mutation is located in exon 5 (Fig. 6) (2Orstavik K.H.

The results from the complementation analysis also show that none of the tafazzins produced from the second translation initiation site were able to complement the phenotype, not even HTAZ-2ndATG-ex5. This is in agreement with the observation that patients with mutations in exons 1 and 2, i.e. before the second translation initiation site which is supposed to be used for the production of the shorter tafazzins, also suffer from BTHS and do not display a milder phenotype when compared with patients with mutations in exons 3–10 (3Johnston J.

These results have important implications for the interpretation of mutational data of patients.

CTIP1 and CTIP2 are also sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that repress transcription through direct, COUP-TF-in-dependent binding to a GC-rich response element. CTIP1- and CTIP2-mediated transcriptional repression is insensitive to trichostatin A, an inhibitor of known class I and II histone deacetylases. However, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that expression of CTIP2 in mammalian cells resulted in deacetylation of histones H3 and/or H4 that were associated with the promoter region of a reporter gene. CTIP2-mediated transcriptional repression, as well as deacetylation of promoter-associated histones H3/H4 in CTIP2-transfected cells, was reversed by nicotinamide, an inhibitor of class III histone deacetylases such as the mammalian homologs of yeast Silent Information Regulator 2 (Sir2). The human homolog of yeast Sir2, SIRT1, was found to interact directly with CTIP2 and was recruited to the promoter template in a CTIP2-dependent manner. Moreover, SIRT1 enhanced the deacetylation of template-associated histones H3/H4 in CTIP2-transfected cells, and stimulated CTIP2-dependent transcriptional repression. Finally, endogenous SIRT1 and CTIP2 co-purified from Jurkat cell nuclear extracts in the context of a large (1–2 mDa) complex.

Both CTIPs are expressed in hematopoietic cells of lymphoid origin, 3D. Shepherd and M. Leid, manuscript in preparation.3D. Shepherd and M. Leid, manuscript in preparation. which is of interest because lymphoid-derived cells are devoid of transcripts encoding COUP-TF family members. 3D. Shepherd and M. Leid, manuscript in preparation. Thus, it is likely that CTIPs either function with other nuclear receptors in cells of lymphoid origin or act as COUP-TF-independent transcription factors in these cells. The latter appears to be true as CTIP1 and CTIP2 have been demonstrated to repress expression of a reporter gene through direct binding to a recently identified binding site, 5′-GGCCGGAGG-3′ (upper strand) (2Avram D. Fields A. Senawong T. Topark-Ngarm A. Leid M. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This repression was observed in the absence of cotransfected COUP-TF proteins and was insensitive to reversal by TSA (2Avram D. Fields A. Senawong T. Topark-Ngarm A. Leid M. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that CTIP proteins may regulate transcription independently of COUP-TF proteins and TSA-sensitive HDACs in some cell types and/or promoter contexts. CTIP1 and CTIP2 have been implicated in the etiology of both myeloid and lymphoid malignancies. Overexpression of the CTIP1 gene following proviral integration in murine hematopoietic cells results in the generation of myeloid leukemia (3Nakamura T. Yamazaki Y. Saiki Y. Moriyama M. Largaespada D.A. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3178-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Similarly, dysregulation of the human CTIP1 locus (2p13) either by amplification or translocation appears to result in B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and immunocytoma (4Satterwhite E. Sonoki T.

The human CTIP2 locus (14q32) has been associated with a translocation event, t(5;14)(q35;q32), which results in acute T lymphoblastic leukemia (5Bernard O.A. Busson-LeConiat M. Ballerini P.

More recently, CTIP2 loss of function mutations were found to contribute to mouse lymphoma genesis, leading the authors to speculate that CTIP2 may function as a tumor suppressor protein (6Wakabayashi Y.

Accordingly, it is important to elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying transcriptional repression mediated by CTIP proteins to understand the biological properties of these proteins, and ultimately, their cellular function(s). A number of mammalian HDACs have been identified and divided into three classes based on their similarity to yeast enzymes. Mammalian class I HDACs, such as HDAC 1–3, 8, and possibly 11, are similar to yeast Rpd3, whereas class II HDACs (HDAC 4–7, 9, and 10) are most similar to the yeast enzyme Hda1 (10De Ruijter A.J.

Histone deacetylation is believed to promote the repressed transcriptional state by facilitating formation of a compacted form of chromatin, thereby making genes less accessible to transcriptional activators and/or the general transcription machinery (16Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). Moreover, TSA-sensitive histone deacetylation is required for the initial steps of heterochromatin formation leading to gene silencing (17Zhang Y. Reinberg D.

A third class of HDACs whose members are structurally and catalytically distinct from class I and class II enzymes is represented by the Sir2-like proteins (reviewed in Refs. 10De Ruijter A.J.

Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar), which distinguishes them from class I and II HDACs. To date, seven human homologs of class III HDACs, known as Sirtuins (SIRT1–7), have been isolated (29Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 30Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Based on protein sequence homology, SIRT1 and its mouse ortholog Sir2α are the closest homologs to yeast Sir2 (11Gray S.G. Ekstrom T.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 29Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Although the substrate specificity of mammalian sirtuins has not been rigorously investigated, mouse Sir2α has been demonstrated to deacetylate lysine 9 and 14 of histone H3 and lysine 16 of H4 in the context of synthetic, acetylated peptides (28Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). SIRT1 has also been demonstrated to deacetylate p53 and attenuate p53-mediated functions (31Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S. Chen D. Su F. Shiloh A. Guarente L. Gu W.

In addition, SIRT1 has been shown to repress p53-mediated transcriptional activation in mammalian cells (31Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S. Chen D. Su F. Shiloh A. Guarente L. Gu W.

Although various in vitro inhibitors of SIRT isozymes have been described, the catalytic activity of class III HDACs is not inhibited by TSA but may be inhibited by nicotinamide, a product of the SIRT-mediated deacetylation reaction (28Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar, 34Grozinger C.M. Chao E.D. Blackwell H.E. Moazed D. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol.

Topark-Ngarm A. Leid M. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we found that transient transfection of CTIP2 resulted in deacetylation of histone H3 and/or H4 that were associated with the promoter region of a target gene. Subsequently, we found that nicotinamide reversed both CTIP2-mediated transcriptional repression and deacetylation of promoter-associated histone H3/H4 in CTIP2-transfected cells. These findings led us to investigate the possibility that a class III HDAC may be involved in CTIP-mediated transcriptional repression. CTIP2 and the class III HDAC SIRT1 co-immunoprecipitated from extracts of transfected, co-transfected and untransfected cells, and the two proteins were shown to interact directly in vitro. Moreover, SIRT1 potentiated both transcriptional repression and histone H3/H4 deacetylation in cells transfected with CTIP2. These findings suggest a role for the NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase SIRT1 in the transcriptional repression activity of CTIP2 in mammalian cells. Constructs—The (17-mer)4-tk-CAT reporter construct was a kind gift from Dr. Ming-jer Tsai (Baylor College of Medicine). FLAG-CTIP2 construct was prepared by PCR amplification of the CTIP2 open reading frame (1Avram D. Fields A. Pretty On Top K. Nevrivy D. Ishmael J.E. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10315-10322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) with appropriate primers and insertion into pcDNA3(+) (Invitrogen). The Gal4 DBD-CTIP2 construct was prepared by PCR amplification with appropriate primers followed by insertion into a commercially available vector (pM; Clontech). Myc-SIRT1, Myc-SIRT1 H363Y, and GST-SIRT1 constructs (33Langley E. Pearson M. Faretta M. Bauer U.M. Frye R.A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2383-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar) were kind gifts from Dr. T. Kouzarides (University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK). All vectors encoding GST fusion proteins were prepared by PCR amplification of appropriate templates followed by insertion into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). The constructs used for generating [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were prepared by PCR amplification with primers containing appropriate restriction sites for insertion into pcDNA3(+) or pcDNA3.1/His (Invitrogen). All constructs were verified by complete DNA sequencing. Antibodies—The rabbit anti-SIRT1 antibody was described previously (33Langley E. Pearson M. Faretta M. Bauer U.M. Frye R.A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2383-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Purified rabbit anti-Sir2α (which cross-reacts with human SIRT1; data not shown) and anti-acetylated-histone H3 and -histone H4 were obtained from Upstate. Mouse anti-FLAG and -Myc monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Sigma and Oncogene, respectively. The rat anti-CTIP2 monoclonal antibody (25B6) was raised against a recombinant GST fusion protein by the Monoclonal Antibody Facility, Institute for Neuroscience, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR. Epitope mapping has revealed that the 25B6 anti-CTIP2 monoclonal antibody recognizes an antigen within the 150 amino acids located at the extreme amino terminus of the protein, CTIP2-(1–150). 4M. Beilstein and M. Leid, unpublished results. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assays were performed on transfected cells essentially as described by the Dean laboratory (36Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. HEK293 cells were co-transfected at 60% confluency (10-cm plates) with 5 μg of the (17-mer)4-tk-CAT reporter, 1.5–10 μg of Gal4-CTIP2, 0.5 μg of Myc-SIRT1, and/or the parent control vectors using the calcium phosphate method. After 48 h, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer and collected in harvesting buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.4, containing 10 mm dithiothreitol). The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, containing 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture). The sonicated lysates were then cleared by centrifugation and diluted 2.5-fold with ChIP dilution buffer (16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, containing 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 167 mm NaCl, and a protease inhibitor mixture). One-tenth of the diluted lysate was reserved as an input sample to determine the total amount of reporter plasmid in transfected cells for subsequent normalization procedures. Two equal aliquots of the remaining lysate were used for immunoprecipitation with and without the addition of antibodies against K9-, K16-di-acetylated histone H3, and K5-, K8-, K12-, K16-tetra-acetylated histone H4 (Upstate; 5 μg of each antibody per immunoprecipitation reaction). Immune complexes were recovered with Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and washed under stringent conditions. Chromatin complexes were eluted with the freshly prepared elution buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3 containing 1% SDS). The eluates and the above input samples were subjected to an overnight reversal of cross-links at 65 °C, followed by treatment with Proteinase K at 45 °C for 1 h. DNA was recovered by using a Nucleospin PCR extraction kit (Clontech) and amplified using a forward primer (5′-GGCATCAGAGCAGATTGTACT-3′) upstream of the multimerized 17-mer and a reverse primer (5′-CCTTAGCTCCTGAAAATCTCG-3′) downstream of the tk promoter but upstream of the transcriptional start site. The resulting PCR product (327 bp) was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Experiments were performed three to five times. Transfection and Reporter Assays—HEK293 cells were transfected and harvested as described above. Where indicated, TSA (100 ng/ml) and nicotinamide (10 mm) treatments were initiated 24 h after transfection, and cells were harvested 24 h later. A β-galactosidase expression vector (pCMV-Sport-βGal, Invitrogen) was cotransfected as an internal control, and β-galactosidase activity was used to normalized CAT activity as described (37Dowell P.

Coimmunoprecipitation Assays—HEK293 cells were transfected as described above with 10 μg each of expression vectors encoding FLAG-CTIP2 and/or Myc-SIRT1. Forty-eight hours after transfection the cells were lysed in NET-N buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture) by agitation at 4 °C for 30 min. After a brief sonication, lysates were cleared by centrifugation and immunoprecipitated as described previously (38Nevrivy D.J. Peterson V.J. Avram D. Ishmael J.E. Hansen S.G. Dowell P. Hruby D.E. Dawson M.I. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16827-16836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) using the antibodies described above. Nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells were prepared using standard techniques (39Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar), and immunoprecipitated (500 μg of protein per reaction) with purified anti-CTIP2 monoclonal (2 μg) or anti-Sir2α (0.5–2.5 μg) antibodies. All immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies. GST Pull-down Experiments—GST pull-down experiments were conducted as described previously (40Dowell P. Peterson V.J. Zabriskie T.M. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2013-2020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, equivalent amounts of GST or GST-SIRT1 fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled proteins (CTIP2 or CTIP2 truncation mutants) prepared using the TnT transcription-translation system (Promega). The reactions were washed five times with binding buffer (10 mm Na-HEPES containing 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40) and bound proteins were eluted and resolved on denaturing SDS-PAGE gels for analysis by autoradiography. Column Chromatography—Nuclear extracts were prepared from 30 liters of Jurkat cells (∼1.5 × 1010 cells; provided by the National Cell Culture Center, Minneapolis, MN) using the Dignam method (39Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar) with the following minor modifications: Buffer C contained 720 mm NaCl instead of 420 mm, and Buffer D was replaced with Buffer 100 (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol). CTIP2 immunoreactivity was found only in the nuclear fraction using this protocol (data not shown). Jurkat nuclear extract (100 mg protein) was applied to a 1.5 × 8-cm phosphocellulose P11 column (Whatman) that had been equilibrated in Buffer 100 and running at 80 ml/h. The column was washed with Buffer 100 until the A 280 returned to baseline and then eluted in a stepwise fashion with Buffer 100 containing 300, 600, and 1000 mm NaCl. The A 280 of the eluate was allowed to return to baseline at each step. CTIP2 and SIRT1 immunoreactivities were analyzed in the step fractions by immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies and chemiluminescence detection. The 600 mm step off the phosphocellulose column (16 mg of protein) was dialyzed against Buffer 100 and loaded onto a 2.5 ml of DEAE Bio-Gel A column (Bio-Rad) that had been equilibrated with Buffer 100. After collecting the flow-through fraction, the column was eluted with Buffer 100 containing 200, 400, and 1000 mm NaCl in a stepwise fashion, and the steps were analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. The 200 mm step off the DEAE column, which contained both CTIP2 and SIRT1 immunoreactivity, was concentrated to 1 ml (3.1 mg of protein) using a Milipore Ultrafree centrifugal filter device (30-kDa nominal molecular mass limit), and loaded onto a 1.6 × 90-cm Superose 6 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) that was running at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The Superose 6 column had been previously equilibrated with Buffer 100 and calibrated with protein standards (thyroglobulin, 669 kDa; catalase, 232 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 67 kDa; blue dextran, 2000 kDa; all from Amersham Biosciences). Fractions (5.0 min, 2.0 ml) were analyzed for the presence of CTIP2 and SIRT1 by immunoblotting. CTIP2-mediated Transcriptional Repression Is Partially Reversed by Nicotinamide, an Inhibitor of NAD + -dependent Deacetylases—Previous studies indicated that CTIP1-mediated transcriptional repression was independent of TSA-sensitive histone deacetylation (1Avram D. Fields A. Pretty On Top K. Nevrivy D. Ishmael J.E. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10315-10322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 2Avram D. Fields A. Senawong T. Topark-Ngarm A. Leid M. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the present study, transcriptional repression mediated by a Gal4-CTIP2 fusion protein was found to be similarly insensitive to reversal with TSA in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 4 and 5 with 7 and 8). Considered together, these findings suggest that neither CTIP1-nor CTIP2-mediated transcriptional repression involves recruitment of class I or class II TSA-sensitive HDACs to the template. However, nicotinamide, an inhibitor of NAD+-dependent, class III HDACs, such as the SIRT family of proteins (29Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 30Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar), was found to inhibit CTIP2-mediated transcriptional repression, at least partially (∼70% reversal of repression; Fig. 1A, compare lanes 7 and 9 with lane 4). These data indicated a possible role of a nicotinamide-sensitive HDAC(s) in the transcriptional repression mechanism of CTIP2 in mammalian cells. If true, transfection of Gal4-CTIP2 would be expected to result in recruitment of a nicotinamide-sensitive HDAC(s) to the template and deacetylation of tem"
https://openalex.org/W2031661692,"The mechanism of formation of high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles by the action of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is not defined completely. To address this issue, we monitored efflux to apoA-I of phosphatidylcholine (PC), sphingomyelin (SM), and unesterified (free) cholesterol (FC) from J774 macrophages, in which ABCA1 is up-regulated, and investigated the nature of the particles formed. The various apoA-I/lipid particles appearing in the extracellular medium were separated by gel filtration chromatography. The presence of apoA-I in the extracellular medium led to the simultaneous formation of more than one type of poorly lipidated apoA-I-containing particle: there were 9- and 12-nm diameter particles containing approximately 3:1 and 1:1 phospholipid/FC (mol/mol), respectively, which were present together with 6-nm monomeric apoA-I. Removal of the C-terminal alpha-helix (residues 223-243) of apoA-I reduced phospholipid and FC efflux and prevented formation of the 9- and 12-nm HDL particles; the apoA-I variant formed larger particles that eluted in the void volume. FC loading of the J774 cells also led to the formation of larger apoA-I-containing particles that were highly enriched in FC. Besides creating HDL particles, ABCA1 mediated release of larger (20-450-nm diameter) FC-rich particles that were not involved in HDL formation and that are probably membrane vesicles. These particles contained 1:1 PC/SM in contrast to the HDL particles, which contained 2:1 PC/SM. This is consistent with lipid raft and non-raft plasma membrane domains being involved primarily in ABCA1-mediated vesicle release and nascent HDL formation, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1984262473,"Proinsulin biosynthesis is regulated in response to nutrients, most notably glucose. In the short term (≤2h) this is due to increases in the translation of pre-existing mRNA. However, prolonging glucose stimulation (24 h) also increases preproinsulin mRNA levels. It has been proposed that secreted insulin from the pancreatic β-cell regulates its own synthesis through a positive autocrine feedback mechanism. Here the comparative contributions of translation and mRNA levels on the levels of proinsulin biosynthesis were examined in isolated pancreatic islets. Also, the autocrine role of insulin upon four β-cell functions (insulin secretion, proinsulin translation, preproinsulin mRNA levels, and total protein synthesis) was investigated in parallel. The results showed that proinsulin biosynthesis is regulated, in the short term (1 h), solely at the level of translation, through an ∼6-fold increase in response to glucose (2.8 mm versus 16.7 mm glucose). In the longer term, when preproinsulin mRNA levels have increased ∼2-fold, a corresponding increase was observed in the fold response of proinsulin translation to a stimulatory glucose concentration (≥10-fold). Importantly, neither exogenously added nor secreted insulin were found to play any role in regulating insulin secretion, proinsulin translation, preproinsulin mRNA levels, or total protein synthesis. The results presented here indicate that long term nutritional state sets the preproinsulin mRNA level in the β-cell at which translation control regulates short term changes in rates of proinsulin biosynthesis in response to glucose, but this is not mediated by any autocrine effect of insulin. Proinsulin biosynthesis is regulated in response to nutrients, most notably glucose. In the short term (≤2h) this is due to increases in the translation of pre-existing mRNA.

In the longer term, when preproinsulin mRNA levels have increased ∼2-fold, a corresponding increase was observed in the fold response of proinsulin translation to a stimulatory glucose concentration (≥10-fold). Importantly, neither exogenously added nor secreted insulin were found to play any role in regulating insulin secretion, proinsulin translation, preproinsulin mRNA levels, or total protein synthesis. The results presented here indicate that long term nutritional state sets the preproinsulin mRNA level in the β-cell at which translation control regulates short term changes in rates of proinsulin biosynthesis in response to glucose, but this is not mediated by any autocrine effect of insulin. Insulin plays an important role in the maintenance of mammalian metabolic homeostasis. Secretion of insulin, from the pancreatic β-cell, is the most efficient means whereby the organism can rapidly decrease circulating blood glucose concentrations. The primary function of the β-cell is the production, storage, and regulated secretion of insulin. Under normal circumstances, the β-cell maintains a remarkable condition where there is always a readily available pool of insulin that can be rapidly secreted in response to a stimulus, such as a rise in extracellular glucose concentration (1Rhodes C.J. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus: A Fundemental and Clinical Text. 2nd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA2000: 20-37Google Scholar). Any increase in insulin release is rapidly compensated for a corresponding increase in proinsulin biosynthesis at the translational level (1Rhodes C.J. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus: A Fundemental and Clinical Text. 2nd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA2000: 20-37Google Scholar), so that β-cell insulin stores are constantly upheld. Thus, production of insulin is a highly regulated and dynamic process.In the short term (≤2 h), proinsulin biosynthesis is predominately regulated at the translational level by many factors including certain nutrients, peptide hormones, and a few pharmacological agents, but of these glucose is the most physiologically relevant (1Rhodes C.J. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus: A Fundemental and Clinical Text. 2nd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA2000: 20-37Google Scholar, 2Itoh N. Okamoto H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22553-22558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As for glucose-induced insulin secretion, glucose metabolism is required to stimulate proinsulin biosynthesis in isolated pancreatic islets (5Ashcroft S.J.H. Diabetologia. 1980; 18: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). It is a highly specific process in the pancreatic β-cell that only applies to biosynthesis of proinsulin and a minor subset of proteins, most of which are insulin secretory granule proteins (6Guest P.C. Bailyes E.M. Rutherford N.G. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of the vast majority of β-cell proteins is subject to general translational regulation as found in other eukaryotic cells (7Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5338-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Stimulatory glucose concentrations (≥4 mm) can increase general protein synthesis in the β-cell up to 2-fold with in 60 min, perhaps via phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor-2B and/or activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (8Gilligan M. Welsh G.I. Flynn A. Bujalska I. Diggle T.A. Denton R.M. Proud C.G. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 2121-2125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9McDaniel M.L. Marshall C.A. Pappan K.L. Kwon G. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2877-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar); however, glucose can induce proinsulin biosynthesis ≥15-fold in the same time frame (10Guest P.G. Rhodes C.J. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 11Alarcón C. Lincoln B. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within this short time period (≤4 h), there is no change in total islet β-cell preproinsulin mRNA levels in response to stimulatory glucose concentrations, despite the marked specific increase in proinsulin biosynthesis (2Itoh N. Okamoto H. Nature. 1980; 283: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 3Welsh M. Scherberg N. Gilmore R. Steiner D.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 4Wicksteed B. Herbert T.P. Alarcón C. Lingohr M.L. Moss L.G. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22553-22558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, there is a change in distribution of preproinsulin mRNA within the β-cell upon glucose stimulation with a recruitment of preproinsulin mRNA from an inert cytosolic pool to translationally active membrane bound polysomes on the rough endoplasmic reticulum, the site of proinsulin biosynthesis (2Itoh N. Okamoto H. Nature. 1980; 283: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 3Welsh M. Scherberg N. Gilmore R. Steiner D.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This is consistent with translational control of proinsulin biosynthesis mediated at, or prior to, the initiation phase (1Rhodes C.J. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus: A Fundemental and Clinical Text. 2nd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA2000: 20-37Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that the specific nature of glucose-induced translational control for proinsulin biosynthesis can be conferred by sequences in the 5′-untranslated region of the preproinsulin mRNA, and that the 3′-untranslated region contains cis-elements involved in glucose-mediated regulation of preproinsulin mRNA stability (4Wicksteed B.

Res. Commun. 1982; 106: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14Giddings S.J. Chirgwin J. Permutt M.A. Diabetes. 1982; 31: 624-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), situations of refeeding after a period starvation (15Giddings S.J. Chirgwin J. Permutt M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 67: 952-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), or chronic hyperglycemia (14Giddings S.J. Chirgwin J. Permutt M.A. Diabetes. 1982; 31: 624-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), proinsulin biosynthesis is also controlled by increases in insulin gene transcription and preproinsulin mRNA stability (16Welsh M. Nielsen D.A. MacKrell A.J. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13590-13594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that this longer term regulation, based at the level of increasing preproinsulin mRNA levels, is supplementary to the glucose-induced translational control of proinsulin biosynthesis (1Rhodes C.J. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus: A Fundemental and Clinical Text. 2nd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA2000: 20-37Google Scholar). However, as long as a mRNA is relatively abundant, as is preproinsulin mRNA in the β-cell (12Tillmar L. Carlsson C. Welsh N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1099-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), the extent of the protein synthesis encoded by that mRNA template may not necessarily depend on the mRNA levels if there is specific translational control (7Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5338-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 17Rouault T. Klausner R. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1997; 35: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, this is an unresolved issue in pancreatic β-cells. In some studies, chronic glucose exposure to pancreatic islets appears to indicate that translational control of proinsulin biosynthesis is relative to preproinsulin mRNA levels (14Giddings S.J. Chirgwin J. Permutt M.A. Diabetes. 1982; 31: 624-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Leibowitz G. Uckaya G. Oprescu A.I. Cerasi E. Gross D.J. Kaiser N. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3214-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); however, in other studies there is no correlation between preproinsulin mRNA levels and the extent of proinsulin biosynthesis (2Itoh N. Okamoto H. Nature. 1980; 283: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 3Welsh M. Scherberg N. Gilmore R. Steiner D.F. Biochem.

Diabetes. 2003; 52: 998-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Here we have investigated whether a relationship exists between preproinsulin mRNA levels and the extent of glucose-induced translational control of proinsulin biosynthesis in the same primary β-cells, for both short and long term exposure glucose.It has been proposed that glucose-induced preproinsulin gene transcription and proinsulin biosynthesis are mediated via a positive feedback of secreted insulin back on the β-cell (20Leibiger B.

It has been argued that the mild glucose-intolerant phenotype of mice, where the insulin receptor gene has been deleted from β-cells (so-called βIRKO mice) (25Kulkarni R.N. Bruning J.C. Winnay J.N. Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 329-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar), is supportive of this argument (26Leibiger I.B. Leibiger B. Berggren P.O. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, it is also possible that the βIRKO mouse phenotype might be primarily due to an inadvertent additional knock-out of the insulin receptor in certain hypothalamic neurons that causes insulin resistance (27Gannon M. Shiota C. Postic C. Wright C.V. Magnuson M. Genesis. 2000; 26: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 28Obici S. Feng Z. Karkanias G. Baskin D.G. Rossetti L. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), which adversely affects β-cell function secondarily (29Rhodes C.J. White M.F. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 32: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Indeed, the idea of insulin having a direct feedback action on β-cell function is controversial. Although insulin can inhibit insulin secretion in vivo (30Elahi D. Nagulesparan M. Hershcopf R.J. Muller D.C. Tobin J.D. Blix P.M. Rubenstein A.H. Unger R.H. Andres R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1982; 306: 1196-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), it does not in denervated human pancreas (31Luzi L. Battezzati A. Perseghin G. Bianchi E. Vergani S. Secchi A. La Rocca E.

Chem. 2002; 277: 26233-26237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), suggesting that suppression of insulin secretion by insulin itself is indirect and neurally mediated (33Boden G. Chen X. DeSantis R. Kolaczynski J. Morris M. Metabolism. 1993; 42: 786-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). While insulin has been implicated to increase insulin gene expression in some studies (20Leibiger B. Moede T. Schwarz T. Brown G.R. Kohler M. Leibiger I.B. Berggren P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

James D.E. Kraegen E.W. Permutt M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or have no effect in isolated islet studies (12Tillmar L. Carlsson C. Welsh N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1099-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Moreover, the mechanism of glucose-induced insulin secretion is distinct from that of glucose-induced proinsulin biosynthesis and insulin gene transcription (1Rhodes C.J. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus: A Fundemental and Clinical Text. 2nd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA2000: 20-37Google Scholar). Somatostatin markedly inhibits glucose-induced insulin secretion but has no effect on glucose-induced proinsulin biosynthesis (35Alarcón C. Wicksteed B.L. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Rhodes C.J. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2496-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) or insulin gene transcription (36German M.S. Moss L.G. Rutter W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22063-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and insulin gene transcription are Ca2+-dependent (36German M.S. Moss L.G. Rutter W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22063-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Prentki M. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 134: 272-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), glucose-induced proinsulin biosynthesis is Ca2+-independent (10Guest P.G. Rhodes C.J. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 11Alarcón C. Lincoln B. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, whereas the KATP-channel sulfonylurea agonists stimulate insulin secretion and diazoxide antagonists inhibit insulin secretion, these reagents have no effect on proinsulin biosynthesis (1Rhodes C.J. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus: A Fundemental and Clinical Text. 2nd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA2000: 20-37Google Scholar, 38Levy J. Malaisse W.J.

As such, there are circumstances where glucose-induced proinsulin biosynthesis is independent of secreted insulin (1Rhodes C.J. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus: A Fundemental and Clinical Text. 2nd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA2000: 20-37Google Scholar). In this study, we have attempted to address the controversy of whether there are feedback effects of secreted insulin on β-cell function by directly measuring regulated insulin secretion, preproinsulin mRNA levels, and proinsulin biosynthesis in isolated rat islets in parallel experiments (and in some instances in the very same islets). No effect of either secreted or exogenously added insulin could be found on glucose-induced insulin secretion, proinsulin biosynthesis, or preproinsulin mRNA levels in either short-term (1 h) or long term (24 h) exposure to glucose.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—EasyTag™ Expre35S35S protein labeling mix from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, containing 73% of l-[35S]methionine, was used for islet metabolic radiolabeling, referred to as [35S]methionine.

Ltd. (Adelaide, Australia). Unless otherwise stated, all other reagents were from Sigma.Islet Isolation and Culture—Islets of Langerhans were isolated from 200-250-g male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories) as described previously (11Alarcón C.

Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2496-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Islets used for analysis of short term incubation conditions (1 h) were initially cultured overnight (16-20 h) in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 5.6 mm glucose, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin to allow recovery from the isolation procedure. These islets were washed and then preincubated in Krebs-Ringer HEPES-buffered saline plus 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin at a basal 2.8 mm glucose for 90 min at 37 °C and then transferred to Krebs-Ringer HEPES-buffered saline at a basal 2.8 mm glucose or stimulatory 16.7 mm glucose alone or with the additional presence of 1 μm somatostatin, 1 μm glyburide, 10 nm IGF-1, 10 or 100 nm insulin, or the absence of extracellular [Ca2+] replaced by 5 mm EGTA as indicated, then incubated for a further 1 h at 37 °C the last 20 min of which was in the additional presence of 100 μCi of [35S]methionine.Islets used for the analysis of β-cell function over the long term (24 h) were also cultured in RPMI 1640 medium but supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, either at a basal 2.8 mm glucose or stimulatory 16.7 mm glucose. These 24-h incubations were also in the presence or absence of 1 μm somatostatin, 1 μm glyburide, 10 nm IGF-1, 10 or 100 nm insulin as indicated. These islets were washed and then, in batches of 40-50 islets, continued for a 1-h incubation at 37 °C in Krebs-Ringer HEPES-buffered saline plus 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin under the same conditions at either a basal 2.8 mm glucose or a stimulatory 16.7 mm glucose ± the additional presence of 1 μm somatostatin, 1 μm glyburide, 10 nm IGF-1, or 10 or 100 nm insulin as indicated, where the last 20 min was in the additional presence of 100 μCi of [35S]methionine.After the second 1-h islet incubation period, 0.1 ml of medium was collected, centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 2 min, and the supernatant stored at -20 °C pending radioimmunoassay for insulin/C-peptide secretion. The islets were then harvested by centrifugation at 500 × g for 2 min and washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm methionine. Those islets to be analyzed for total protein and proinsulin biosynthesis were lysed in 100 μl of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6) containing 1.0% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm E64, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 μm 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, and 10 μm leupeptin with sonication (25 watts, 10 s, on ice). A 5-μl aliquot was taken from this lysate and stored at -20 °C pending radioimmunoassay for intracellular insulin/C-peptide content. Islets for analysis of mRNA levels were lysed in the lysis buffer supplied with the Direct Lysate kit (Ambion) prior to RNase protection assay.Protein Synthesis Analysis—Total protein synthesis was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation in a 5-μl aliquot of islet lysates as previously described (11Alarcón C.

Immunoprecipitated 35S-labeled proinsulin was then subjected to alkaline-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, fluorography, and quantitative densitometric scanning as described previously (4Wicksteed B.

Prior to (pro)insulin immunoprecipitation islet lysates were made equivalent for the amount of total protein synthesis as assessed by trichloroacetic acid-precipitation, so as to examine specific glucose-induced proinsulin biosynthesis.Analysis of Islet mRNA Levels—The mRNA levels in islets were analyzed by the RNase protection assay, using the direct lysis kit (Ambion) as described previously (4Wicksteed B.

Essentially, RNA was protected using [32P]uridine-labeled antisense RNA fragments corresponding to the coding region of preproinsulin or to part of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) coding region (Ambion). This yielded protected RNA fragments of 200 bp for the endogenous preproinsulin mRNA and 318 bp of the GAPDH mRNA. Samples were resolved by denaturing 5% acrylamide/TBE (Tris, boric acid, EDTA) gel electrophoresis and analyzed by autoradiography and phosphorimaging (Coulter Beckman).Radioimmunoassay—Insulin radioimmunoassay was performed using rat insulin standards and antibodies (Linco Research, Inc., St. Charles, MO). Insulin secretion was calculated as a percentage of islet insulin content. C-peptide radioimmunoassay was performed using a rat C-peptide immunoassay kit (Linco Research, Inc.). C-peptide secretion was also calculated as a percentage of islet C-peptide content.Immunoblot Analysis—Islet cell lysates were first normalized for total protein levels as determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and then subjected to immunoblot analysis as described previously (40Dickson L.M.

In many instances these β-cell functional parameters have been measured in the same islets, but the results for insulin secretion, preproinsulin mRNA levels, total proteins synthesis, and specific regulation of proinsulin biosynthesis in short term (1 h) and long term (24 h) periods of glucose stimulation are presented individually.Insulin/C-peptide Secretion—As anticipated, isolated rat pancreatic islets incubated at a stimulatory 16.7 mm glucose secreted 16-fold more insulin than those incubated at a basal 2.8 mm glucose (Fig. 1A; p ≤ 0.01) during a 1-h incubation period. After 24 h at a stimulatory 16.7 mm glucose, the rate of insulin secretion was 25-fold greater than that at a basal 2.8 mm glucose (Fig. 2A; p ≤ 0.01). Glucose-stimulated insulin release in 1-h incubations was inhibited by >90% without extracellular [Ca2+] in the incubation medium (Fig. 1A; p ≤ 0.01), as observed previously (10Guest P.G. Rhodes C.J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar experiment could not be done over a 24-h incubation period, since a prolonged absence of [Ca2+] in the extracellular incubation medium causes pancreatic islets to break up. The added presence of somatostatin inhibited glucose-induced insulin secretion by ∼60% over a 1-h incubation period (Fig. 1A; p ≤ 0.05) and by ∼70% during a 24-h period (p ≤ 0.01; Fig. 2A), as described before (35Alarcón C.

The sulfonylurea, glyburide, increased the basal rate of insulin secretion at 2.8 mm glucose 4-5-fold over1h(p ≤ 0.05; Fig. 1A) and 19-fold over 24 h (p ≤ 0.01; Fig. 2A), as expected. Likewise, glyburide significantly potentiated 16.7 mm glucose-induced insulin secretion during 1-h (p ≤ 0.05; Fig. 1A) and 24-h incubation periods (p ≤ 0.05; Fig. 2A) over that of stimulatory glucose alone. In contrast, the addition of IGF-1 had no significant affect on glucose-induced insulin secretion over 1-h (Fig. 1A) or 24-h (Fig. 2A) incubation periods. To examine whether addition of exogenous insulin can have an effect on glucose-induced insulin secretion, C-peptide secretion (which is normally secreted in equimolar qu"

Using recombinant histone complexes, we show that yNAP1 has a preference for binding the (H3-H4)2 tetramer over the (H2A-H2B) dimer. We find that the loss of the histone tails abrogates this preference for H3 and H4, and we demonstrate a direct interaction between yNAP1 and the amino-terminal tails of H3 and H4. yNAP1 binds to one histone fold domain, thus specifying the stoichiometry of the complexes formed with the histone dimer and tetramer. Finally, we provide evidence that the acidic carboxyl-terminal region of yNAP1, although dispensable for nucleosome assembly in vitro, contributes to binding via structure-independent electrostatic interactions. Our results are consistent with recent mechanistic investigations of NAP1 and expand our understanding of the histone chaperone family of assembly factors.

The organization of DNA with an equal mass of proteins to form highly organized chromatin is a hallmark of all eukaryotes. It is at this level that the majority of the processes involving the DNA substrate (such as replication, transcription, repair, and recombination) are enacted. The fundamental repeating unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which consists of 147 bp of DNA wrapped in 1.65 supercoiled turns around a core of eight histone proteins, the histone octamer (1Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar). The histone octamer is composed of two copies each of the four histone proteins; H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. At physiological salt concentrations, histones exist either as (H2A-H2B) dimers or (H3-H4)2 tetramers (2Eickbush T.H. Moudrianakis E.N. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4955-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The latter can be described as a dimer of dimers. Histones dimerize via the structurally conserved histone fold motif that is common to all four histones to form the histone fold dimer (3Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11170-11174Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 4Luger K. Richmond T.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). A single tetramer binds the central 60 bp of DNA within a nucleosome, whereas two (H2A-H2B) dimers each organize 30 bp of DNA on either side of the tetramer, with the dimers making contacts with opposing faces of the central tetramer. DNA binding is mainly afforded by the structured regions of the histones (histone fold and extensions (5Luger K. Richmond T.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar)). The amino-terminal basic tails of each histone protein are largely unstructured in solution as determined by NMR spectroscopy (6Smith R.M. Rill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10574-10581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are too disordered to be observed in electron density maps from crystals of the histone octamer and the nucleosome (1Luger K.

The regulation of their involvement in transcription via combinatorial post-translational modification of selected amino acid residues is currently a topic of intense research (16Iizuka M. Smith M.M.

Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6448) Google Scholar). The transport of histones into the nucleus and the ordered deposition of histone subcomplexes onto DNA are carried out by highly regulated assembly proteins (for review, see Refs. 19Ito T. Tyler J.K.

Cell. 1996; 87: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). In vivo, these events often involve the synchronous activity of ATP-driven and ATP-independent assembly factors to deposit histones onto the DNA and to organize regularly spaced nucleosomal arrays (20Philpott A.

The (H3-H4)2 tetramer acquires a unique set of acetyl groups on lysines in the histone tails followed by binding and deposition by the chromatin assembly factor (CAF) 1The abbreviations used are: CAF, chromatin assembly factor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NAP, nucleosome assembly protein; RCAF, replication-coupled chromatin assembly factor.1The abbreviations used are: CAF, chromatin assembly factor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NAP, nucleosome assembly protein; RCAF, replication-coupled chromatin assembly factor. 1 (21Verreault A. Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Cell. 1996; 87: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The replication-coupled assembly factor (RCAF) also catalyzes this activity (24Tyler J.K. Adams C.R. Chen S.R. Kobayashi R. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Nature. 1999; 402: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Deposition of the (H2A-H2B) dimer is facilitated by an ATP-independent nucleosome assembly protein (NAP1; for review, see Refs. 20Philpott A. Krude T. Laskey R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 23Tyler J.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2268-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, and 25Akey C.W. Luger K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 6-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). NAP1, which can be classified as a histone chaperone in the true sense of the word, was initially purified from HeLa cells (26Ishimi Y. Hirosumi J. Sato W. Sugasawa K. Yokota S. Hanaoka F. Yamada M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and has since been isolated from a diverse set of organisms, such as soybeans, yeast, Paramecium, Drosophila, and Xenopus (27Yoon H.W.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). NAP1 has been isolated from a Drosophila extract (30Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) in complex with H2A and H2B, and from human cells in complex with histone H2A (31Chang L. Loranger S.S. Mizzen C. Ernst S.G. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and it has thus been considered an (H2A-H2B) histone chaperone. However, in vitro, Drosophila NAP1 (dNAP1), human NAP1 (AP1), and yeast NAP1 (yNAP1) also bind the (H3-H4)2 tetramer (32Ishimi Y. Kojima M. Yamada M. Hanaoka F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 33McQuibban G.A. Commisso-Cappelli C.N. Lewis P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6582-6590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). NAP1 is involved not only in the assembly of nucleosomes onto DNA (34Nakagawa T. Bulger M. Muramatsu M. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27384-27391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 35Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2048-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) but also in the remodeling of nucleosomes during transcriptional activation (36Ito T. Ikehara T. Nakagawa T. Kraus W.L. Muramatsu M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1899-1907PubMed Google Scholar, 37Walter P.P. Owen-Hughes T.A. Cote J. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6178-6187Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and in the recruitment of coactivators and the activation of transcription by facilitating the interaction between coactivators and chromatin (38Shikama N. Chan H.M. Krstic-Demonacos M. Smith L. Lee C.W. Cairns W. La Thangue N.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8933-8943Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 39Asahara H. Tartare-Deckert S. Nakagawa T. Ikehara T. Hirose F. Hunter T. Ito T. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2974-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). NAP1 has been shown to be phosphorylated by cellular kinases in a cell cycle-dependent manner (40Rodriguez P. Pelletier J. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and to be associated with components of the cell cycle regulatory machinery (41Zimmerman Z.A. Kellogg D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 201-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 42Altman R. Kellogg D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, NAP1 likely plays a role in the onset and regulation of mitotic events. An unusually high content of acidic amino acids is characteristic of histone chaperones (25Akey C.W. Luger K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 6-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). yNAP1 has four highly acidic regions distributed throughout its entire length. The most prominent acidic domain is located near the carboxyl terminus (amino acids 366–403), where 28 of 38 amino acids are either aspartic or glutamic acid residues. Surprisingly, this region, as well as a portion of the amino terminus, is dispensable for chromatin assembly (43Fujii-Nakata T. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20980-20986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The basic histone amino-terminal tails are considered to be likely targets for NAP1 binding, possibly through an interaction with one or more of the acidic domains within the NAP1 protein. Consistent with this idea, a previous study reported that yNAP1 interacts exclusively with the amino-terminal tails of the histone octamer and that the tails are required for yNAP1-mediated chromatin assembly (33McQuibban G.A. Commisso-Cappelli C.N. Lewis P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6582-6590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, this same study showed that yNAP1 fails to bind mono- or polynucleosomes, even though the histone tails are likely to be accessible for such interactions in this structural context (4Luger K. Richmond T.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that in vitro chromatin assembly using the structurally and functionally homologous dNAP1 (30Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) occurs in the absence of the histone tails (44Georges S.A. Kraus W.L. Luger K. Nyborg J.K. Laybourn P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 45An W. Palhan V.B. Karymov M.A. Leuba S.H. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 811-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, the exact role of the amino-terminal histone tails in chromatin assembly by NAP1 remains to be elucidated. Here we investigate the preference and relative affinity of yNAP1 for recombinant histones and dissect the contribution of the histone fold and histone tails toward this interaction. In contrast to previous findings (32Ishimi Y. Kojima M. Yamada M. Hanaoka F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 33McQuibban G.A. Commisso-Cappelli C.N. Lewis P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6582-6590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we show that yNAP1 has a preference for the (H3-H4)2 tetramer over the (H2A-H2B) dimer. This preference is dependent on the amino-terminal tails of H3 and/or H4. We find that yNAP1 binds directly to the tails of both H3 and H4, but we do not observe yNAP1 binding to the amino-terminal tails of H2A or H2B, despite similarities in residue content. In the absence of the amino-terminal tails, yNAP1 binds the two core histone subcomplexes with nearly equal affinity. Protein-protein EMSA suggests the stoichiometry of the yNAP1/histone complexes to be 2:1 and 4:1 for the (H2A-H2B) dimer and (H3-H4)2 tetramer, respectively. Finally, we extend previous observations (43Fujii-Nakata T. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20980-20986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and examine a series of yNAP1 truncations by circular dichroism (CD), topological assembly assays, and direct binding assays. We conclude that the chromatin assembly activity of NAP1 resides solely in the central core of the protein, which also is responsible for histone fold-specific binding. The acidic carboxyl terminus of yNAP1, although dispensable for chromatin assembly, contributes to binding via structure-independent, electrostatic interactions. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Full-length yNAP1 was expressed and purified from the pTN2 expression vector (kind gift from Dr. Kikuchi) as described (43Fujii-Nakata T. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20980-20986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the following changes. The dialyzed fraction from the 35–65% ammonium sulfate cut was centrifuged, and the supernatant was applied to a 10 Q-Sepharose FF anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was then washed and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6 (4 °C), 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Fractions were assayed for yNAP1 by SDS-PAGE, and peak fractions were pooled. The peak was diluted with buffer A to a final NaCl concentration of 150 mm and applied to a 1-ml Mono Q anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). yNAP1 was eluted with 500 mm NaCl. Peak fractions were dialyzed into buffer A with 150 mm NaCl and stored in aliquots at –80 °C. All amino acid coordinates are reported using the sequence specified by accession number J05759. GST-yNAP1 deletion mutants were generated by PCR amplification from the pTN2 plasmid, with PCR primers encoding BamHI and SmaI restriction sites. His6-tagged proteins were generated by PCR amplification of the pTN2 plasmid with primers encoding NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. Restriction enzyme digested and purified PCR products were ligated into similarly digested pGEX4T2 (Amersham Biosciences) for GST fusions, or pET15b (Novagen) for His6 fusions. These constructs were transformed into DH5α cells and screened by restriction digestion and by sequencing to confirm the identity of the clones. GST fusions were purified by standard methods, dialyzed into buffer A (100 mm NaCl), and stored in aliquots at –80 °C. His6 fusions were expressed and purified over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and purified further by Mono Q chromatography. Peak fractions were dialyzed against buffer A (150 mm NaCl) and stored in aliquots at –80 °C. Insoluble His6-74–293 and His6-74–353 were extracted from inclusion bodies by solubilization of lysed, centrifuged cell pellets in 8 m urea. The solution was centrifuged and the supernatant applied to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid as described above. Full-length yNAP1, when subjected to a similar denaturation/renaturation, recovers full chromatin assembly activity (43Fujii-Nakata T. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20980-20986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as does His6-74–365. GST fusion proteins for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae amino-terminal tails (46Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gasser S.M. Grunstein M. Cell. 1995; 80: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) were expressed and purified by standard methods (see above). These expression plasmids encoded H2A (amino acids 1–35), H2B (1–35), H3 (1–46), and H4 (1–34). Recombinant yeast and Xenopus laevis histones (full-length and truncated versions) were purified and refolded to (H2A-H2B) dimer and (H3-H4)2 tetramer as described (47Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J.

The amino acid coordinates of the amino-terminally deleted histone cores have been described previously (52Bohm L. Crane-Robinson C. Biosci. Rep. 1984; 4: 365-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Histones were stored in 1 m NaCl, 50% glycerol at –20 °C. Native Drosophila histone H1 was purified as described previously (53Croston G.E. Lira L.M. Kadonaga J.T. Protein Expression Purif. 1991; 2: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). GST Pull-down Assays—Coomassie-stained GST pull-down assays were performed by incubating 100 pmol of GST or GST fusion proteins with 20 μl glutathione-agarose (Sigma) in 200 μl of TPD-25 (20 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 5 μm zinc sulfate, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 25mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 2–3 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, secondary (target) proteins were added (the amounts are indicated in the figure legends) and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. Bound proteins were washed extensively with TPD-250 (250 mm KCl) and briefly with 1× phosphate-buffered saline prior to loading on SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For GST pull-down assays using detection by Western blot (anti-His6 (H-15), Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 10 pmol of GST or GST fusion was bound to 10 μl of glutathione-agarose, and 20–50 pmol of target protein was added prior to 16-h incubation in TPD (25 mm KCl). Following washing as described above, proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Gel Filtration Chromatography—Fractionation was performed on a FPLC Purifier® using a Superdex S-200 preparation grade 13/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). Samples were prepared and run in buffer A (150 mm NaCl) at 0.5 ml/min. Fractions were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid prior to SDS-PAGE. Elution volumes were measured by peak integration using Unicorn software (Amersham Biosciences); and K av values were calculated Equation 1Kav=Vr-V0/Vc-V0(Eq. 1) where Vr is retention volume, V 0 is the void volume for the column (8.16 ml), and Vc is the column volume (24 ml). K av was plotted against the molecular masses (log) for standards (Gel Filtration Calibration Kit; Amersham Biosciences) run in buffer A (150 mm NaCl). The best fit exponential for the plot was determined in Cricket Graph III, and the, apparent molecular mass was determined by substitution of K av into the equation for the line. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—EMSAs were performed by incubating 10 μm yNAP1 in a 20-μl reaction with the indicated concentrations of histones at 4 °C for 16 h to establish equilibrium. All proteins had been previously dialyzed into EMSA buffer (20 mm Tris pH 7.6 (4 °C), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Half of the binding reactions were transferred to a chilled tube containing 5 μl of 20% sucrose, and the samples were loaded onto a 5% acrylamide, 0.2 × TBE gel (8 × 10 cm, 1.5 mm thick), electrophoresed for 60 min at 150 V (negative → positive), and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Molar ratios of histones to yNAP1 (where bound yNAP1 = 100%) were determined following digitization of the Coomassie-stained gels and quantitation using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). The stoichiometry of the yNAP1-histone primary complex was determined by extrapolation of a linear fit of the plot of unbound yNAP1 (abscissa) versus molar ratio of histone to yNAP1. The intersection on the ordinate (histone:yNAP1 ratio) represents the molar ratio at which all yNAP1 is in complex. Although all data points are shown, only the lower, most linear portion of the data was utilized in the fit. Digitization noise led to the poor fit of data points as the percent of free yNAP1 approached zero. Proteolytic Cleavage—Trypsin digestion of yNAP1 was performed at an enzyme concentration of 1 μg/mg yNAP1 protein (1:1,000 w/w), at a yNAP1 concentration of 1 mg/ml, and at 22 °C for the indicated time. The digestion products were resolved by 18% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. For amino-terminal sequencing, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) prior to sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Procise 491 protein sequencer, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was performed on a Voyager DE Pro (Perseptive Biosystems). Chromatin Assembly—In vitro assembly reactions were performed at yNAP1 to core histone mass ratios of 4:1, as described (36Ito T. Ikehara T. Nakagawa T. Kraus W.L. Muramatsu M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1899-1907PubMed Google Scholar), and assembled DNA was separated on 1.2% agarose gels and stained with SYBR-Gold (Molecular Probes). The use of mass ratios caused a progressive increase in the moles of yNAP1 utilized as construct molecular mass decreased (76 pmol of yNAP1, 88 pmol of 74–417, 102 pmol of 74–365, 108 pmol of 74–353, 136 pmol of 74–293). Thus, the relative assembly activity of smaller constructs is overestimated in this assay. Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were collected on a Jasco 720 spectrometer at 5 °C. 20 spectra were obtained and averaged for each polypeptide in 20 mm NaH2PO4 pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl. The molar ellipticity [Θ] was obtained by normalization of the measured ellipticity (in millidegrees) Θ, using Equation 2[Θ]=Θ*100/(n*l*c)(Eq. 2) where n is the number of residues, c is the total concentration in mm, and l is the cell path length in cm. Percent helix is estimated as described previously (54Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar). yNAP1 Preferentially Binds the (H3/H4)2 Tetramer over the (H2A-H2B) Dimer—Recombinant histones of both yeast and Xenopus origin were refolded to (H2A-H2B) dimers, (H3-H4)2 tetramers, and octamers (consisting of two (H2A-H2B) dimers and one (H3-H4)2 tetramer). The formation of correct histone complexes was verified by gel filtration (62Kimura H. Cook P.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1341-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), and the purified histone complexes were assayed for yNAP1 binding using a GST pull-down assay (Fig. 1A). Although yNAP1 showed robust and nearly equivalent binding to (H2A-H2B) dimers and (H3-H4)2 tetramers in separate reactions (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 6, respectively), a clear preference for the tetramer was observed when dimers and tetramers were allowed to compete directly in the form of octamers (Fig 1A, lane 8). Note that the histone octamer dissociates into two (H2A-H2B) dimers and one (H3-H4)2 tetramer under physiological and assay conditions (2Eickbush T.H. Moudrianakis E.N. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4955-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Because identical results were obtained with recombinant histone complexes from X. laevis (Fig. 1A) and yeast (data not shown), we utilized X. laevis recombinant histones in subsequent experiments. To investigate whether assembly-specific post-translational modifications affect the relative affinity of yNAP-1 for different histone pairs, we directly compared yNAP1 binding to recombinant and native Drosophila core histone octamers in the GST pull-down assay (Fig. 1B). A clear preference for the (H3-H4)2 tetramer over the (H2A-H2B) dimer was observed for both preparations, although it is not quite as pronounced as that observed for X. laevis histones. To rule out replication-dependent Drosophila core histone modifications different from those found in yeast, we performed an identical experiment with native and recombinant S. cerevisiae octamers, with identical results (data not shown). We used analytical gel filtration chromatography to compare the types of complex formed between yNAP1 and the two types of histone pairs. Consistent with previous observations for Drosophila NAP1 (dNAP1) (30Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), yNAP1 (49.15 kDa) eluted with an anomalously high apparent molecular mass of 220 kDa (Fig. 1C). Subsequent hydrodynamic measurements have identified this species as yNAP1 dimers and a fraction of larger oligomers. 2S. J. McBryant and O. B. Peersen, manuscript in preparation. Only a modest change in the elution position was observed when yNAP1 and an equimolar amount of histone dimer were preincubated. The observed apparent molecular mass of 251 kDa is consistent with a single yNAP1 dimer in complex with a single (H2A-H2B) dimer (apparent molecular mass 28.6 kDa by gel filtration, data not shown). This ratio is also apparent from visual analysis of gel filtration peak fractions by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1D). In contrast, the yNAP1·(H3-H4)2 tetramer complex eluted near the void volume for this column (>1 MDa). SDS-PAGE evaluation of peak fractions indicated a mass ratio that is inconsistent with a large excess of (H3-H4)2 (Fig. 1D). The observed elution volume for the yNAP1-tetramer complex thus suggests a substantial change in either the shape or aggregation state of yNAP1. Gel filtration of yNAP1 with the recombinant histone octamer also resulted in a significant change in the elution profile compared with yNAP1 alone, again eluting near the void volume (data not shown). When fractions were evaluated by SDS-PAGE, preferential binding of (H3-H4)2 to yNAP1 was again observed (Fig. 1D, inset). yNAP1 Forms Distinct Complexes with (H2A-H2B) and (H3-H4)2—We next determined the stoichiometry of the yNAP1/histone complexes. An EMSA was developed to visualize and quantitate yNAP1-histone complexes directly (Fig. 2). Increasing concentrations of histone pairs, in the presence of a constant amount of yNAP1, resulted in distinct bands. As the ratio of (H3-H4)2 tetramer to yNAP1 monomer approached ∼0.25: 1"
https://openalex.org/W2000596554,"The emergence of drug-resistant forms of Plasmodium falciparum emphasizes the need to develop new antimalarials. In this context, the fatty acid biosynthesis (FAS) pathway of the malarial parasite has recently received a lot of attention. Due to differences in the fatty acid biosynthesis systems of Plasmodium and man, this pathway is a good target for the development of new and selective therapeutic drugs directed against malaria. In continuation of these efforts we report cloning and overexpression of P. falciparum β-hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) dehydratase (PffabZ) gene that codes for a 17-kDa protein. The enzyme catalyzes the dehydration of β-hydroxyacyl-ACP to trans-2-acyl-ACP, the third step in the elongation phase of the FAS cycle. It has a K m of 199 μM and k cat/K m of 80.4 m-1 s-1 for the substrate analog β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA but utilizes crotonoyl-CoA, the product of the reaction, more efficiently (K m = 86 μM, k cat/K m = 220 m-1 s-1). More importantly, we also identify inhibitors (NAS-91 and NAS-21) for the enzyme. Both the inhibitors prevented the binding of crotonoyl-CoA to PfFabZ in a competitive fashion. Indeed these inhibitors compromised the growth of P. falciparum in cultures and inhibited the parasite fatty acid synthesis pathway both in cell-free extracts as well as in situ. We modeled the structure of PfFabZ using Escherichia coli β-hydroxydecanoyl thioester dehydratase (EcFabA) as a template. We also modeled the inhibitor complexes of PfFabZ to elucidate the mode of binding of these compounds to FabZ. The discovery of the inhibitors of FabZ, reported for the first time against any member of this family of enzymes, essential to the type II FAS pathway opens up new avenues for treating a number of infectious diseases including malaria.

Malaria continues to exact the highest mortality and morbidity rate next only to tuberculosis. “The scourge of the tropics,” malaria is endemic to around 100 countries in the world. Approximately 500 million cases of malaria are reported every year, and around 3000 children die of malaria every day (1World Health OrganizationWorld Health Rep. 1999; : 49-63Google Scholar). Emerging resistance to chloroquine and other currently prescribed drugs limits treatment of malaria today, in particular cerebral malaria, caused by Plasmodium falciparum (2Sherman I.W. Malaria. American Society for, Washington, D. C.logy Press1998Google Scholar, 3Asindi A.A. Ekanem E.E. Ibia E.O. Nawangawa M.A. Trop. Geogr. Med. 1993; 45: 110-113PubMed Google Scholar). The situation definitely warrants express remedial actions: extensive research on P. falciparum to identify drug targets and, ultimately, the development of a new armamentarium of antimalarials. Our recent demonstration of the occurrence of the type II fatty acid synthesis (FAS) 1The abbreviations used are: FAS, fatty acid synthesis; FabZ, β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; PfFabZ, Plasmodium falciparum β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase; PfFabI, P. falciparum enoyl-ACP reductase; FabA, β-hydroxydecanoyl thioester dehydratase; RT, reverse transcriptase; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; EcFabA, Escherichia coli β-hydroxydecanoyl thioester dehydratase.1The abbreviations used are: FAS, fatty acid synthesis; FabZ, β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; PfFabZ, Plasmodium falciparum β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase; PfFabI, P. falciparum enoyl-ACP reductase; FabA, β-hydroxydecanoyl thioester dehydratase; RT, reverse transcriptase; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; EcFabA, Escherichia coli β-hydroxydecanoyl thioester dehydratase. pathway in the malaria parasite and its inhibition by triclosan, an inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzyme of type II FAS, enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase, proved the pivotal role played by this pathway in the survival of the malarial parasite (4Surolia N. Surolia A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 5Kapoor M. Dar M.J. Surolia A. Surolia N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 832-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The essential role of fatty acids and lipids in cell growth and differentiation and the different type (type I) of fatty acid biosynthetic pathway occurring in the human host, which is distinct from type II FAS of the malaria parasite, makes this pathway an attractive drug target for treating malaria (6Surolia N. RamachandraRao S.R. Surolia A. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 7Ramya T.N.C. Surolia N. Surolia A. Curr. Sci. 2002; 83: 101-108Google Scholar). The type II fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, found in most bacteria and plants, is typified by the existence of distinct enzymes encoded by unique genes for catalyzing each of the four individual chemical reactions required to complete successive cycles of fatty acid elongation (Refs. 4Surolia N. Surolia A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 8Weeks G. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1180-1189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and 9Marrakchi H. Zhang Y.-M. Rock C.O. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 1050-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar and Scheme I). This is in contrast to the type I FAS characterized by a multifunctional enzyme catalyzing all the steps of the pathway (10Rock C.O. Cronan J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The third step of the elongation cycle, the dehydration of β-hydroxyacyl-ACP to trans-2-acyl-ACP, is carried out by FabA or FabZ (11Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27795-27801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). While FabZ only catalyzes the dehydration reaction, FabA is a bifunctional enzyme and carries out an additional isomerization reaction of trans-2-acyl-ACP to cis-3-acyl-ACP, a reaction essential to unsaturated fatty acid synthesis (12Brock D.J.H. Kass L.R. Bloch K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4432-4440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Streptococcus pneumoniae, instead of FabA, a new enzyme, FabM (trans-2,cis-3-decenoyl-ACP isomerase), catalyzes the isomerization step of trans-2-decenoyl-ACP to cis-3-decenoyl-ACP following the dehydration step by FabZ (13Marrakchi H. Choi K.-H. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44809-44816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). FabZ is the primary dehydratase that participates in the elongation cycles of saturated as well as unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, whereas FabA is more active in the dehydration of β-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP (11Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27795-27801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 14Hoang T.T. Schweizer H.P. Am. Soc. Microbiol. 1997; 179: 5326-5332Google Scholar). This dichotomy allows the synthesis of unsaturated as well as saturated fatty acids, which eventually dictate the composition of the cell membranes. Dehydratase activity is crucial for the supply of trans-2-acyl-ACP to FabI, which pulls each cycle of elongation to completion (11Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27795-27801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 15Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26538-26542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). FabZ thus presents itself as a suitable, yet unexplored target for the design of antimalarials. Here we report the cloning, expression, and characterization of P. falciparum FabZ (PfFabZ), the gene sequence of which has been deposited earlier by us in a public data base (GenBank™ accession number AY118082). FabZ was expressed as a soluble, active protein, and its purification was achieved by a single step purification protocol. We report its molecular and enzymatic properties. Further we have identified two lead compounds with inhibitory activity toward P. falciparum FabZ, which represents a significant advance in this area as no inhibitors of FabZ from any source are known to date. Crotonoyl-CoA, β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, imidazole, kanamycin, and SDS-PAGE reagents were obtained from Sigma. Cesium carbonate, 2-bromo-4-chlorophenol, N-methylpyrrolidinone, and cuprous chloride were purchased from Aldrich. Media components were obtained from Hi-media (Delhi, India). All other chemicals used were of analytical grade. [1,2-14C]Acetic acid, sodium salt (specific activity, 60 mCi/mmol), and [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (specific activity, 54.2 mCi/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Escherichia coli DH5α cells were used during the cloning of the gene. pET-28a(+) vector (Novagen) and BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) were used for the expression of FabZ. Total RNA was isolated from 10 ml of packed erythrocytes (infected with P. falciparum,10–12% parasitemia) after saponin lysis by a single step method of RNA isolation (16Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar). The isolated RNA was treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega, 1 unit/μg of RNA) for 45 min at 37 °C and repurified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. RT-PCR was performed using a one step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). PCR was performed with the primers (forward, 5′-GGAATTCCATATGAATTTAACCTTTCCTAATTATG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CGGGATCCTTATTTCGATAAGGCAAACGTCATTTC-3′ with NdeI and BamHI sites underlined, respectively). PCR conditions used were: 1 × (94 °C 5 min), 30 × (94 °C 1 min, 50 °C 1 min, 72 °C 1 min), 1 × (72 °C 10 min). The primers were designed using the GenBank™ accession number AF237572 to clone the mature protein (without the leader peptide and transit sequence, required for targeting of the protein to apicoplast). The 465-bp RT-PCR product was excised from a 1.2% agarose gel, purified using silica gel particles (QIAEX II gel extraction system, Qiagen), and cloned in pGEMT-Easy vector (Promega). Candidate plasmids containing the correct sized inserts were confirmed by digestion and dideoxy sequencing on an ABI Prism 377 semiadaptive sequencer Version 3.0. The insert present in pGEMT-Easy was reamplified using the abovementioned primers and subcloned in pET-28a(+) vector (Novagen) in-frame with the N terminus His6 tag. The constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen), and cultures were grown at 37 °C in Luria Broth (Hi-media) until A 600 of 0.6. These were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and further incubated at 12 °C for 12 h. Cells were harvested at 8000 rpm for 10 min, and the resultant pellet was stored at -70 °C until further use. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole. Cells were disrupted using a probe-type ultrasonicator (Vibra-Cell, Sonics and Materials). Cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant obtained was applied to a Ni-NTA metal affinity column (His-bind resin, Novagen) equilibrated with the lysis buffer. The column was initially washed with lysis buffer and subsequently washed with the same buffer containing 60 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted using a step gradient of 0.3–0.5 m imidazole, and fractions were tested for purity by SDS-PAGE. The protein was applied on a fast protein liquid chromatography desalting column to remove imidazole followed by concentration of the protein using Centriprep-10. Protein concentration was determined from A 280, assuming the molar extinction coefficient E280 = 9530 m-1 cm-1, which was calculated using the formula from Ref. 17Mulvey R.S. Gualtieri R.J. Beychok S. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar. We further truncated the protein by removing 10 residues from the N terminus by using primers (forward, 5′-ACGTCCATGGTGCATCATCATCATCATCATATTGATATAGAAGATATTAAGAAAATTCTTCCACATAGATATCCTTTCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CGGGATCCTTATTTCGATAAGGCAAACGTCATTTC-3′ with NcoI and BamHI sites underlined, respectively), and the PCR conditions used were as described above. The truncated gene was ligated into pET-28a(+) vector. The truncation led to an increase in the protein yield by 3-fold, i.e. from 5 to 15 mg/liter. Purified PfFabZ (2 mg/ml) was injected onto a Superdex™ 200 HR 10- × 300-mm column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl (pH 7.5) connected to an ÄKTA™ design system. The column flow rate was maintained at 0.3 ml/min. The molecular weight of PfFabZ was determined by plotting V e/V 0 versus elution volume for standard proteins. V e corresponds to the peak elution volume of the standard protein, and V 0 represents the void volume of the column determined using blue dextran (M r < 2,000,000). Dynamic light scattering studies were performed on a Brookhaven Instruments Dynamic Light Scattering setup that can measure sizes from 2 to 4000 nm. The sample of PfFabZ (1 mg/ml) in 20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl (pH 7.5) was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min and filtered through a 0.2-μ filter. The data acquisition time was 3 min. The routines used to fit the data points were cumulants, and non-negative least squares analysis was used to obtain the radius of gyration of PfFabZ. All experiments were carried out on a Jasco V-530 UV-visible spectrophotometer. FabZ was assayed at 25 °C by monitoring the forward as well as the reverse reaction, i.e. increase and decrease in A 260, respectively, due to the conversion of β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA to crotonoyl-CoA and vice versa. The standard reaction mixture in a total volume of 100 μl contained 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 8 μg of FabZ, and 100 μm β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA or crotonoyl-CoA. The K m for each substrate analog was determined by varying its concentration. The kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting initial velocity data to the Michaelis-Menten equation by non-linear regression analysis using SigmaPlot 2000 software. The forward (k forward) and reverse (k reverse) rate constants were determined by using the following first order rate equation (Equation 1), log[S]=(-kt/2.3)+log[S]0(Eq. 1) where a plot of log[S] versus t is linear with a slope of -k/2.3 and an intercept of log[S]0 on the log[S] axis. [S] is the substrate concentration at time t, and k is the first order rate constant. The reaction was performed as described above and stopped by the addition of 3% chloroform, and the compounds were separated by reverse phase HPLC as described earlier (18DeBuysere M.S. Olson M.S. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 133: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, the mixtures were loaded onto a Sephasil Peptide C18 column (4.6 mm × 25 cm; particle diameter, 5 μm; column volume, 4.155 ml; Amersham Biosciences), and the compounds were separated on a gradient of 220 mm phosphate buffer, pH 4.0 and methanol:chloroform (98:2). The retention times of β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, crotonoyl-CoA, butyryl-CoA, and NADH were 14.8, 39.61, 48.47, and 4.31 min, respectively, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. To determine the K m of PfFabZ for crotonoyl-CoA by HPLC, the peaks obtained while running different reaction mixtures were compared with the peaks of the standard run. For the FabZ-FabI coupled assay, PfFabI was purified according to published protocols (5Kapoor M. Dar M.J. Surolia A. Surolia N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 832-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The structure of FabZ is not available from any source, but P. falciparum FabZ shares 21% sequence identity with E. coli FabA. We modeled P. falciparum FabZ using E. coli FabA (Protein Data Bank code 1MKB) as the template. Modeling was done using MOE (Molecular Operating Environment) (19Inc Chemical Computing Group Molecular Operating Environment (MOE). Version 2001.07. Chemical Computing Group, Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada2001Google Scholar). Ten intermediate homology models were built as a result of the permutational selection of different loop candidates and side chain rotamers. The intermediate models were averaged to produce the final model by Cartesian average. We used Swiss-Pdb-Viewer to generate the dimeric structure with transformation matrix from the template structure (20Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9507) Google Scholar). Of the four compounds synthesized, NAS-21, NAS-75, and NAS-79 were synthesized using published procedures (21Penning T.D. Talley J.J. Bertenshaw S.R. Carter J.S. Collins P.W. Docter S. Graneto M.J.

Preparation of 4,4,4-Trifluoro-1-(4-nitrophenyl)butane-1,3-dione (NAS-21)—To a solution of ethyl trifluoroacetate (1.4 ml, 0.012 m) in methyl tert-butyl ether 25% NaOCH3 in methanol (4 ml, 1.5 eq) was added slowly. A solution of 4-nitroacetophenone (1.65 g, 0.01 m) in methyl tert-butyl ether was added to this mixture dropwise over 10 min. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 h. After the completion of the reaction the mixture was quenched with 3 n HCl. The organic layer was collected, washed with water and brine, and dried over Na2SO4, and the product (1.80 g) was crystallized from chloroform (70% yield). Preparation of 1-(4-Methoxyphenyl)ethanone [(4-Trifluoromethyl)pyrimidine-2-yl]hydrazone (NAS-75)—To 4-methoxyacetophenone (150 mg, 1 mm) in 5 ml of acetic acid and 1 ml of water 2-hydrazino-4-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidine (178 mg, 1 mm) was added. Shortly after addition, a solid formed to which acetic acid was added to maintain stirring for 16 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with 4 ml of water, and subsequently the solid mass was filtered and dried in vacuo to afford 270 mg (90% yield) of the product. Preparation of 1-(4-Methylphenyl)ethanone [(4-Trifluoromethyl)pyrimidine-2-yl]hydrazone (NAS-79)—NAS-79 was prepared as in Ref. 22Bebernitz G.R. Argentieri G. Battle B. Brennan C. Balkan B.

Preparation of 4-Chloro-2-[(5-chloroquinolin-8-yl)oxy]phenol (NAS-91)—Cesium carbonate (2 mm, 651 mg) was added to 5-chloro-8-hydroxyquinoline (2 mm, 360 mg) in 5 ml of N-methylpyrrolidinone, and the slurry was heated with stirring under regular flow of N2 at 110 °C for 45 min. After cooling the reaction mixture to room temperature, 2-bromo-4-chlorophenol (1 mm, 207 mg) and copper (I) chloride (0.5 mm, 50 mg) was added. The flask was degassed and filled with N2 four to five times. The reaction mixture was heated at 140 °C for 70 h under the continuous flow of N2. The completion of the reaction was monitored by thin layer chromatography. After completion the reaction mixture was diluted 10 times with ethyl acetate and filtered through celite. The organic layer was washed with water and brine and dried over sodium sulfate. The product in the organic layer thus obtained was purified on a silica gel (100–200 mesh) column equilibrated in petroleum ether. Adsorbed material was eluted with a gradient of 1–12% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether. NAS-91 eluted at 10% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether.

The inhibition of PfFabZ activity was monitored by the spectrophotometric assay performed as described above except that a given inhibitor was added prior to the initiation of the reaction by addition of crotonoyl-CoA. The studies were performed in the presence of 1% Me2SO used for solubilizing the inhibitors. The inhibition constant K i was determined by the Dixon plot and the Lineweaver-Burk equation. In Dixon's method (23Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (3280) Google Scholar), the enzyme activity was measured at four different concentrations of substrate (50, 75, 100, and 125 μm) as a function of the inhibitor concentration (0.1–2.5 μm). For the determination of K i by the Lineweaver-Burk equation the enzyme assays were performed in the absence and presence (1 μm) of each inhibitor at a range of substrate concentrations (10–60 μm). Fluorescence measurements were performed on a Jobin-Yvon Horiba fluorimeter under computer control. The excitation and emission monochromator slit widths were 3 and 5 nm, respectively. Measurements were performed at 25 °C in a 3-ml quartz cuvette, and the solutions were mixed continuously on a magnetic stirrer. The solutions containing PfFabZ were excited at 280 nm, and the emission was recorded from 300 to 500 nm. For inhibitor binding studies, PfFabZ (22 μm) in 20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 was titrated with different concentrations of the inhibitors (0–8.3 μm). The magnitude of fluorescence decrease (F 0 - F) upon addition of each inhibitor concentration was fitted to Equation 2 to determine the value of K i, (F0-F)=ΔFmax/{1+(Ki/[I])}(Eq. 2) Corrections for the inner filter effect were performed according to Equation 3 (24Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 44-45Google Scholar), Fc=Fantilog[(Aex+Aem)/2](Eq. 3) where F c and F are the corrected and measured fluorescence intensities, respectively. A ex and A em are the solution absorbances at the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. K i represents the dissociation constant of the inhibitor for PfFabZ. ΔG, the change in free energy upon binding of inhibitor to the protein, was calculated from Equation 4, ΔG=-RTlnKb(Eq. 4) where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and K b is the binding constant. The experiments were performed using P. falciparum FCK2 strain (chloroquine-sensitive, IC50, 18 nm), an isolate from Karnataka, India. P. falciparum was cultured using standard techniques (25Trager W. Jenson J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6121) Google Scholar) and routinely synchronized using 5% sorbitol (26Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2813) Google Scholar). Growth inhibition by the compounds of interest was assessed by [3H]hypoxanthine uptake. Typically uninfected or infected (1–2% parasitemia) red blood cells (2% hematocrit) were added to the culture medium in the wells of a 96-well plate (Nunc), and different concentrations of inhibitor in Me2SO were added such that the final concentration of Me2SO did not exceed 0.05%. The experiment was started with the synchronized parasite culture in the early trophozoite stage, and [3H]hypoxanthine was added to the culture after incubation with the inhibitors for 48 h. The culture from the 96-well plate was harvested after 31 h (27Arnot D.E. Gull K. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1998; 92: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 28Suarez J.E. Urquiza M.

The IC50 was calculated from a plot of relative percent parasitemia versus log concentration of the inhibitor by fitting it to non-linear regression analysis using SigmaPlot 2000 software. The in vitro fatty acid synthesis was performed as described earlier (4Surolia N. Surolia A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 30Bergler H. Fuchsbichler S. Hogenauer G. Turnowsky F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Trophozoites isolated from 100-ml cultures with 8–10% parasitemia were resuspended and sonicated in 0.2 ml of 70 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) for 5 s and centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was used as crude extract for determining the in vitro fatty acid synthesis. The assay mixture in 70 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) contained 1.4 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm acetyl-CoA, 3.6 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 0.14 mm EDTA, 200 μm NADH, 200 μm NADPH, 1 unit of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 250 μg of parasite protein, and 80 μm [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (4Surolia N. Surolia A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by addition of solution containing 120 μg of freshly reduced ACP. The reaction mixture was incubated for 35 min with or without 10 μm NAS-91 or NAS-21, which was added just before the addition of ACP, at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was then treated with 4 m HCl at 100 °C for 2 h. The fatty acids were extracted in chloroform and methylated at 4 °C with diazomethane in ether, and the incorporation of [2-14C]malonyl-CoA into fatty acids was monitored by thin layer chromatography on silanized silica thin layer plates (Merck) developed with a solvent system of acetone:water:methanol:acetic acid (70:50:35:1) as described previously (4Surolia N. Surolia A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 30Bergler H. Fuchsbichler S. Hogenauer G. Turnowsky F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Inhibitors (10 and 100 μm) were added to P. falciparum cultures (100 ml, 9–10% parasitemia) for 70 h after which cultures were resuspended in 7 ml of the complete medium while retaining the same concentrations of the inhibitors. To this [1,2-14C]acetic acid was added (50 μCi/ml) (4Surolia N. Surolia A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). After 2 h, parasites were isolated, washed thoroughly with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, sonicated, spotted onto a Whatman No. 3MM paper disc, and counted using the scintillation fluid (4Surolia N. Surolia A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The data reported are from an average of two independent duplicate experiments.

Platelets contain all three members of the SNAP-23/25/29 gene family, but by comparison to brain tissue, SNAP-23 is the most highly enriched of these proteins in platelets. SNAP-23 function is required for exocytosis from platelet α, dense, and lysosomal granules. SNAP-23 was phosphorylated largely on serine residues in platelets activated with thrombin. Phosphorylation kinetics paralleled or preceded granule secretion. Inhibition studies suggested that SNAP-23 phosphorylation proceeds largely through a protein kinase C (PKC) mechanism and purified PKC directly phosphorylated recombinant (r-) SNAP-23 (up to 0.3 mol of phosphate/mol of protein). Five major tryptic phosphopeptides were identified in cellular SNAP-23 isolated from activated platelets; three phosphopeptides co-migrated with those identified in PKC-phosphorylated r-SNAP-23. In contrast, only one major phosphopeptide was identified when SNAP-23, engaged in a ternary SNARE complex, was phosphorylated by PKC. Ion trap mass spectrometry revealed that platelet SNAP-23 was phosphorylated at Ser23/Thr24 and Ser161, after cell activation by thrombin; these sites were also identified in PKC-phosphorylated r-SNAP-23. SNAP-23 mutants that mimic phosphorylation at Ser23/Thr24 inhibited syntaxin 4 interactions, whereas a phosphorylation mutant of Ser161 had only minor effects. Taken together these studies show that SNAP-23 is phosphorylated in platelets during cell activation through a PKC-related mechanism at two or more sites with kinetics that parallel or precede granule secretion. Because mutants that mimic SNAP-23 phosphorylation affect syntaxin 4 interactions, we hypothesize that SNAP-23 phosphorylation may be important for modulating SNARE-complex interactions during membrane trafficking and fusion.

Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). SNAREs assemble into tight complexes that connect membranes and may induce membrane fusion. The prototypic SNARE complex contains one member from three different gene families: SNAP-25, syntaxin, and VAMP. The SNARE proteins contribute four α-helices to produce an extremely stable four-helix bundle with 16 highly conserved layers of interacting amino acid side chains (for classification of SNAREs and numbering the layers, see Refs. 3Fasshauer D.

The assembly and disassembly of the SNARE complexes are under the kinetic control of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) and soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs), as well as Rab GTPases and Sec1/Munc18 family proteins (reviewed in Ref. 5Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Regulated exocytosis or secretion from cells is a subset of intracellular membrane trafficking and fusion. In specialized secretory cells, such as neurons, neuroendocrine cells, or platelets, exocytosis from secretory vesicles is triggered by intracellular signals produced by cell activation through cell surface receptors or membrane depolarization. Phosphorylation of SNARE machinery proteins may be an important signal in regulated secretion. Phosphorylation of synaptic vesicle proteins has been implicated in the regulation of neurotransmitter release (6Greengard P. Valtorta F.C. Czernik A.J. Benfenati F. Science. 1993; 259: 780-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). SNAREs have been shown to be substrates of purified or recombinant kinases in vitro (7Nielander H.B. Onofri F. Valtorta F.

Still, a clear picture has yet to emerge about the functional significance, the cell or developmental specificity, and the control of SNARE phosphorylation. Platelets play an important role in thrombosis, arteriosclerosis, and vascular remodeling through regulated secretion of effector molecules from platelet granules. The molecular secretory machinery in platelets has important homologies to the machinery found in neurons and other cells (reviewed in Ref. 16Reed G.L. Fitzgerald M.L. Polgar J.

Platelet membranes contain syntaxins 2 and 4, and they have been shown to be required for platelet secretion (18Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Fitzgerald M.L.

Blood. 2002; 100: 1081-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Platelets also contain SNAP-23, but less is known about SNAP-25 and SNAP-29. SNAP-23 is a ubiquitously expressed non-neuronal homolog (25Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) that shares 59% identity with SNAP-25 at the amino acid level. Like SNAP-25, SNAP-23 does not possess a transmembrane domain but it is palmitoylated on one or more cysteine residues present in a central palmitoylation domain, which allows anchoring to membranes (26Vogel K. Roche P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). There is 32% identity between SNAP-29 and SNAP-25, and 26% identity between SNAP-29 and SNAP-23. It is likely that SNAP-29, like other two members of this subfamily, contributes two helical domains to the formation of a four-helix SNARE bundle (27Steegmaier M. Bin Yang B. Yoo J.S. Huang B. Shen M. Yu S. Luo Y. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34171-34179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Recent data show that the SNAREs are key players in the membrane trafficking/fusion events that accompany platelet granule secretion. It is poorly understood how platelet activation by agonists acting on cell surface receptors is linked to SNARE-mediated platelet granule secretion. We have shown that platelet Sec1/Munc18 (PSP) (8Hirling H. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11945-11949Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and syntaxin 4 (28Chung S.H. Polgar J. Reed G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25286-25291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) are phosphorylated in a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent fashion when the platelet is activated. Phosphorylation of PSP and syntaxin 4 modulates their interactions with other proteins, and thus may regulate secretion (8Hirling H. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11945-11949Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 28Chung S.H. Polgar J. Reed G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25286-25291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These recent findings establish a possible link of the SNARE machinery through PKC signaling to receptor-mediated cell activation in platelets. In this report we examine the expression of members of the SNAP-25 family in platelets. SNAP-23 is an abundantly expressed member of this family and is required for secretion from all three types of platelet granules. Inhibition studies indicate that phosphorylation of SNAP-23 is PKC-dependent. With cell activation, SNAP-23 is phosphorylated at two sites in platelets, Ser23/Thr24 and Ser161. Both of these sites were also identified as phosphorylation sites when recombinant (r-) SNAP-23 was phosphorylated by purified PKC. Thus, SNAP-23 is a target for phosphorylation in platelets when cells are activated to secrete by thrombin. SNAP-23 phosphorylation kinetics parallel or precede granule secretion, suggesting that SNARE phosphorylation may play a functional role in exocytosis. This hypothesis was supported by the finding that mutants of SNAP-23 that mimic phosphorylation at Ser23/Thr24 showed reduced binding to syntaxin 4, indicating that phosphorylation of SNAP-23 at these sites may affect SNARE interactions. Materials—Antibodies against human r-SNAP-23 were generated in rabbits and affinity-purified using immobilized antigens. Rabbit polyclonal anti-SNAP-23 peptide (amino acids 192–216) antisera were from Synaptic Systems (Gottingen, Germany). Anti-syntaxin 4 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies, 4G10, and purified PKC were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NJ); anti-P-selectin monoclonal antibodies (AK-6) were from Biodesign (Kennebunk, ME). Monoclonal antibodies against human recombinant PSP were generated in mice. All kinase inhibitors and recombinant PKC isozymes were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). 5-Hydroxy-[2-14C]tryptamine creatinine sulfate ([14C]serotonin) was from Amersham Biosciences. Preparation of Recombinant SNAREs and SNARE Complexes— SNAP-23 and the cytosolic domain of syntaxin 4 were produced as described (28Chung S.H. Polgar J. Reed G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25286-25291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). SNAP-23 Ser23 → Asp/Thr24 → Asp and Ser161 → Asp mutants were produced by overlap PCR using the following primers: for Ser23 → Asp/Thr24 → Asp, CCATGGATAATCTGTCATCAGA and CTAAACCCAGGATTCTCC, GATGAGTCTCTGGAAGATGATAGGAGAATCCTGGGTTTAG and CGATCGTTAGCTGTCAATGAGTTTC, CCATGGATAATCTGTCATCAGA and CGATCGTTAGCTGTCAATGAGTTTC; for Ser161 → Asp, CCATGGATAATCTGTCATCAGA and CTTTTAGATTTACCAGGATATCGCCCACTTGAGTCAG, CGATCGTTAGCTGTCAATGAGTTTC and GATATCCTGGGAAATCTAAAAG, CCATGGATAATCTGTCATCAGA and CGATCGTTAGCTGTCAATGAGTTTC. DNA from two clones each for Ser23 → Asp/Thr24 → Asp and Ser161 → Asp mutants with correct sequences (verified with double-stranded DNA sequencing) were ligated in-frame into the NcoI and KpnI sites of pProEX HTA expression vector (Invitrogen). Recombinant SNAP-23 proteins were produced as described for SNAP-23 (28Chung S.H. Polgar J. Reed G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25286-25291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Six recombinant GST-tagged proteins representing the native N- and C-terminal SNARE motifs of SNAP-23 as well as the Asp or Ala mutants in positions Ser23/Thr24 and Ser161 were also produced using standard protocols (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A. Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and the GST tag was cleaved with thrombin. The cytosolic domain of human VAMP 2 was produced as recombinant GST-tagged (Amersham Biosciences) protein in Escherichia coli using standard protocols (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A. Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), the GST tag was cleaved with thrombin, and VAMP 2 was further purified by FPLC as described (30Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28036-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Ternary complexes of SNAP-23, syntaxin 4, and VAMP 2 were produced and purified as described (31Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Binding Assays—The binding of SNAP-23 and SNAP-23 mutants to syntaxin 4 was studied in a solid-phase assay similar as described previously (18Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Fitzgerald M.L. Blood. 1999; 93: 2617-2626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Chung S.H. Polgar J. Reed G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25286-25291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Wells of a microtiter plate were coated with recombinant syntaxin 4 (50 μl of 10 μg/ml) for 1–2 h and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin. Coated syntaxin 4 was incubated with native or mutated SNAP-23 (using the indicated concentrations, time, and temperatures). The wells were washed to remove unbound proteins, and polyclonal anti-SNAP-23 antiserum (200-fold dilution) was added for 1 h. (Preliminary experiments confirmed that the SNAP-23 antibody bound equally well to the SNAP-23 point mutants). After washing, the bound antibody was detected by 125I-protein A (50,000 cpm/50 μl). In Vitro Phosphorylation of Recombinant Proteins—Phosphorylation of recombinant SNAP-23 and SNAP-23/syntaxin 4/VAMP 2 complexes with PKC was performed as described for the phosphorylation of syntaxin 4 (28Chung S.H. Polgar J. Reed G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25286-25291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino Acid Analysis and Phosphopeptide Fingerprinting— SNAP-23 (immunoprecipitated from 32P-labeled platelets, and r-SNAP-23 phosphorylated with PKC and [32P]ATP) was separated from other proteins by SDS-PAGE and immobilized on PVDF membranes by electroblotting. Phosphoamino acid analysis and two-dimensional (tryptic) phosphopeptide mapping (phosphopeptide fingerprinting) were performed as described by Sefton (32Sefton B.M. Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley and Sons, Edison, NJ1995: 18.3.1-18.3.8Google Scholar) and Meisenhelder et al. (33Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Taylor G. Current Protocols in Protein Science. Wiley and Sons, Edison, NJ1999: 13.9.1-13.9.27Google Scholar). For phosphopeptide fingerprinting, first dimension electrophoresis was performed at pH 1.9 and second dimension chromatography was performed in n-butyl alcohol:pyridine:glacial acetic acid:water (5:3.3:1:4). Platelet and Recombinant SNAP-23 Phosphorylation Site Determination by Ion Trap Mass Spectrometry—Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) from four healthy volunteers was prepared as described (19Polgar J. Reed G.L. Blood. 1999; 94: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets were pelleted with centrifugation and resuspended at a 10-fold concentration in a modified Tyrode's buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.4 mm Na2HPO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. The samples were kept in a 37 °C water bath; a small portion of the sample was used to measure the platelet count and P-selectin expression. P-selectin expression on non-stimulated cells was <2% of that in thrombin-stimulated cells, confirming that the platelets were not activated. The samples were combined and diluted with buffer to 1.4 × 109 platelets/ml of suspension. Half of the platelet sample was activated with 1 unit/ml thrombin, whereas the other half was treated with 1 μm prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) for 30 s. Platelets were then solubilized by adding 0.1 volume of lysis buffer (2.5% SDS, 50 mm EDTA, 100 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm NaF, 1 mg/ml leupeptin) and 0.05 volume of freshly dissolved 20 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and samples were put on ice. The samples were boiled in 1-ml aliquots for 5 min, allowed to cool to room temperature, and diluted with 4 volumes of 1.25× buffer A (buffer A: 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Anti-SNAP-23 antibodies (affinity-purified using immobilized SNAP-23) were coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma). The gel (1 ml of settled gel, 4 mg of coupled IgG/ml) was equilibrated with buffer A before adding it to the platelet lysate. After a 2-h rotation at room temperature, the gel was settled in a small column and washed first with 10 ml of buffer A followed with 40 ml of 140 ml NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Bound proteins were eluted with 5 ml of 20 mm CHAPS, 0.1 mm glycine, pH 2.9. The pH was neutralized with 50 μl of 3 m Tris, and the sample was concentrated to 100 μl using Centricon 10 (Amicon, Beverly, MA) concentrator. The concentrated sample contained ∼4 μg of SNAP-23 as determined by quantitative immunoblotting with calibration curves obtained with human r-SNAP-23. After reducing SDS-PAGE (12% gel) and visualization with traditional Coomassie staining, the band corresponding to SNAP-23 was subjected to in gel reduction, carboxyamidomethylation, and tryptic digestion (Promega). Phosphorylated peptide sequences were determined using a 75-μm reverse phase microcolumn terminating in a custom nanoelectrospray source directly coupled to a LCQ DECA XP Plus quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan). The flow rate was nominally 200 nl/min. The ion trap repetitively surveyed the range m/z 395–1600, executing data-dependent tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) for peptide sequence information on the four most abundant ions in each survey scan. MS/MS spectra were acquired with a relative collision energy of 30% and an isolation width of 2.5 daltons, and recurring ions were dynamically excluded. After data base correlation with the algorithm SEQUEST (34Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R.I. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5314) Google Scholar), phosphorylated peptides were confirmed by manual, de novo interpretation of the MS/MS spectra using FuzzyIons (35Chittum H. Lane W. Carlson B. Roller P. Lung F. Lee B. Hatfield D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10866-10870Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Measurement of the Effects of Kinase Inhibitors on Thrombin-induced SNAP-23 Phosphorylation in Platelets—Thrombin-induced SNAP-23 phosphorylation in intact (not permeabilized) platelets was measured as described for syntaxin 4 phosphorylation (28Chung S.H. Polgar J. Reed G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25286-25291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) with the modification that the 32P-loaded platelets were incubated with the kinase inhibitors at room temperature for 30 min instead of at 30 °C for 15 min. Measurement of Granule Secretion and SNAP-23 Phosphorylation in Parallel Assays—Human PRP was prepared from freshly drawn blood as described (9Foster L.J. Yeung B. Mohtashami M. Ross K. Trimble W.S. Klip A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11089-11096Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). PGI2 (0.2 μm) was added, and the PRP was incubated in a 37 °C water bath for 1 h with and without [14C]serotonin addition (3 μlof50 μCi/ml, 57 mCi/mmol [14C]serotonin per ml of PRP). Platelets were pelleted with centrifugation and resuspended in 0.33 volume of the original PRP in a buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 12 mm NaHCO3, 5.5 mm glucose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 μm PGI2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Then 0.1 volume of water or 32P-labeled inorganic phosphate (10 mCi/ml, specific activity of 285 Ci/mg) was added. The samples were incubated in a 30 °C water bath for 1 h. Then 0.01 volume of 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added, and the platelets were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in the above buffer now containing 0.1% BSA and no PGI2. Platelets loaded with [14C]serotonin or 32P were used to measure granule secretion or phosphorylation of SNAP-23, respectively. Non-stirred platelet samples were activated with various concentrations of thrombin at room temperature (22 ± 1.5 °C). For granule secretion measurements, platelet activation was terminated by adding 1 volume of 2% ice-cold paraformaldehyde and putting the samples on ice. α granule secretion was monitored by measuring P-selectin expression with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD62 antibodies AC1.2 (Becton Dickinson) and flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson) as described (36Michelson A.D. Shattil S.J. Watson S.P. Authi K.S. Platelets: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1996: 111-129Google Scholar). Typically, 2.5 μl of fixed platelets were added to 97.5 μl of antibody solution. After 15 min the samples were diluted with 1 ml of Tyrode's buffer containing 0.35% BSA and analyzed. Total or 100% P-selectin expression was defined as that induced in 10 min by 1 unit/ml thrombin. P-selectin expression on non-stimulated platelets was <2%. The remaining samples were centrifuged at 2500 × g for 1 min, and the supernatants were used for scintillation counting of [14C]serotonin to assess dense granule secretion. Total or 100% [14C]serotonin secretion was defined as the [14C]serotonin secreted from platelets activated with 1 unit/ml thrombin for 10 min. For the measurement of SNAP-23 phosphorylation (32P samples), platelet activation was terminated by adding lysis buffer and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (above) and the samples were put on ice. The samples were boiled for 5 min, cooled to room temperature, and diluted with 4 volumes of 1.25× radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer as described (28Chung S.H. Polgar J. Reed G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25286-25291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation with anti-SNAP-23 antibodies and immunoblotting was performed as described (28Chung S.H. Polgar J. Reed G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25286-25291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Phospho-SNAP-23 was detected by phosphorimaging, whereas SNAP-23 protein in the membrane was detected with chemifluorescence imaging (Storm 840, Molecular Dynamics). To allow comparison between individual experiments, the phosphorimaging pixel values for each SNAP-23 band were normalized to the corresponding chemifluorescence pixel values. Measurement of Granule Secretion in Permeabilized Platelets—Platelets were pelleted from PRP by centrifugation and resuspended to a concentration of 8 × 108/ml in a Ca2+ -buffering solution (buffer B, 20 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm glucose, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.05% BSA). Streptolysin O (Sigma) was dissolved in buffer B at a concentration of 25,000 units/ml, reduced with 2 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C for 1 h, and stored at –70 °C in aliquots. Platelets (20 μl) were mixed with buffer B (25 μl) containing 200–400 units/ml streptolysin O and 150 μg/ml anti-SNAP-23 antibodies or pre-immune rabbit IgG. The samples were incubated first at room temperature for 10 min and on ice for 30 min. Then ATP (50 mm) and magnesium diacetate (125 mm) in 5 μl of buffer B were added, and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Granule secretion was induced by increasing the free calcium ion concentration to 10 μm by adding CaCl2 in buffer B. The free calcium ion concentration was determined by the calcium ion titration curves described by Knight and Scrutton (37Knight D.E. Scrutton M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 221: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). After 5 min of incubation, 3-μl samples were used for the measurement of α granule secretion (as described below), the remaining samples were put on ice and centrifuged at 2500 × g for 1 min, and the supernatants were used for scintillation counting of [14C]serotonin to assess dense granule secretion and for the measurement of hexosaminidase activity to assess lysosomal secretion as described (21Chen D. Lemons P.P. Schraw T. Whiteheart S.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α granule secretion was monitored by measuring P-selectin expression with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD62 antibodies AC1.2 and flow cytometry as described (36Michelson A.D. Shattil S.J. Watson S.P. Authi K.S. Platelets: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1996: 111-129Google Scholar). Total (100%) P-selectin expression was defined as that induced by 1 unit/ml thrombin"
https://openalex.org/W2148385700,"We have studied Hansenula polymorpha Pex5p and Pex8p using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). Pex5p is the Peroxisomal Targeting Signal 1 (PTS1) receptor and Pex8p is an intraperoxisomal protein. Both proteins are essential for PTS1 protein import and have been shown to physically interact. We used FCS to analyze the molecular role of this interaction. FCS is a very sensitive technique that allows analysis of dynamic processes of fluorescently marked molecules at equilibrium in a very tiny volume. We used this technique to determine the oligomeric state of both peroxins and to analyze binding of Pex5p to PTS1 peptides and Pex8p. HpPex5p and HpPex8p were overproduced in Escherichia coli, purified by affinity chromatography, and, when required, labeled with the fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 488. FCS measurements revealed that the oligomeric state of HpPex5p varied, ranging from monomers at slightly acidic pH to tetramers at neutral pH. HpPex8p formed monomers at all pH values tested. Using fluorescein-labeled PTS1 peptide and unlabeled HpPex5p, we established that PTS1 peptide only bound to tetrameric HpPex5p. Upon addition of HpPex8p, a heterodimeric complex was formed consisting of one HpPex8p and one HpPex5p molecule. This process was paralleled by dissociation of PTS1 peptide from HpPex5p, indicating that Pex8p may play an important role in cargo release from the PTS1 receptor.

Our data show that FCS is a powerful technique to explore dynamic physical interactions that occur between peroxins during peroxisomal matrix protein import. Peroxisomes are single membrane-bound organelles that are present in most aerobic eukaryotic cells. They acquire their matrix proteins by uptake of newly synthesized proteins from the cytosol. This process occurs predominantly via two pathways that rely on either of two conserved peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS1 1The abbreviations used are: PTS, peroxisomal targeting signal; FCS, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy; Fl, fluorescein.1The abbreviations used are: PTS, peroxisomal targeting signal; FCS, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy; Fl, fluorescein. and PTS2). The vast majority of matrix proteins contain a PTS1 that consists of a tripeptide motif (SKL or variants thereof) located at the extreme C terminus of the protein. PEX genes are essential for peroxisome biogenesis and have been numbered 1 to 29 according to the order of description (extensively reviewed in Ref. 1Purdue P.E. Lazarow P.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 701-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Most of them encode proteins, designated peroxins, that play a role in peroxisomal matrix protein import.The PEX5 gene encodes the PTS1 receptor, Pex5p, which binds newly synthesized PTS1 proteins in the cytosol. This receptor is proposed to be translocated together with its cargo into the peroxisomal matrix (2Van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Dammai and Subramani (3Dammai V. Subramani S. Cell. 2001; 105: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) presented compelling evidence that human Pex5p, indeed, cycles between these two subcellular compartments.Pex8p is the only known intraperoxisomal peroxin involved in matrix protein import. It is not required for association of Pex5p at the receptor docking complex on the peroxisomal membrane (4Rehling P. Skaletz-Rorowski A. Girzalsky W. Voorn-Brouwer T.M. Franse M.M. Distel B. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. Erdmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3593-3602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) but is important at a later stage in the import process. Recently, Agne et al. (5Agne B. Meindl N.M. Niederhoff K. Einwachter H. Rehling P. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Girzalsky W. Kunau W.H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) showed that ScPex8p is important for the association of the receptor docking complex (comprising Pex14p and Pex17p) with another membrane-bound complex that contains the ring finger proteins Pex2p, Pex10p, Pex12p. Both membrane-bound protein complexes are involved in matrix protein import and possibly only function upon connection by Pex8p at the trans-site of the peroxisomal membrane (5Agne B. Meindl N.M. Niederhoff K. Einwachter H. Rehling P. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Girzalsky W. Kunau W.H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).Results of two-hybrid analysis and co-immune precipitations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that ScPex8p also physically interacts with ScPex5p in the organellar matrix (4Rehling P. Skaletz-Rorowski A. Girzalsky W. Voorn-Brouwer T.M. Franse M.M. Distel B. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. Erdmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3593-3602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The molecular role of this interaction is still unknown. Most known Pex8 proteins contain a PTS1. However, the PTS1 of Pex8p is not the sole potential site of interaction with Pex5p, because this interaction is still robust when the PTS1 is removed (4Rehling P. Skaletz-Rorowski A. Girzalsky W. Voorn-Brouwer T.M. Franse M.M. Distel B. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. Erdmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3593-3602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Most likely, the PTS1 of Pex8p is involved in targeting of the protein to peroxisomes instead of being important for its ultimate role in PTS1 matrix protein import.To understand the molecular role of the physical interaction between Pex5p and Pex8p in matrix protein import, we studied these peroxins using a novel approach in peroxisome research, namely fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). FCS is a very sensitive technique developed for the study of dynamic processes of fluorescently labeled molecules at equilibrium in a tiny “volume” (6Medina M.A. Schwille P. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 758-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 7Hess S.T. Huang S. Heikal A.A. Webb W.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 8Hink M.A. Borst J.W. Visser A.J.W.G. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 361: 93-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). FCS was developed in the mid-1970s but has only recently been recognized as a powerful tool in various areas of research. In FCS measurements, fluorescence intensity fluctuations are recorded only from those molecules that diffuse through an open volume element created by a focused laser beam. The time required for passage of molecules through this volume element is determined by the diffusion time, which is inversely proportional to the diffusion coefficient that is related to the size of the molecule. Thus, diffusion constants obtained from the analysis of fluorescence intensity fluctuations allow differentiation between relatively small, rapidly diffusing molecules and larger, more slowly diffusing ones.Advantages of FCS over the techniques that are generally used to study protein-protein interactions (yeast two-hybrid analysis, GST pull-down experiments, co-immune precipitations) is that the size of protein complexes can be estimated, allowing prediction of the stoichiometry of the interacting components. In addition, the fraction of free and bound molecules at equilibrium can be determined. Moreover, the proteins to be studied are not immobilized and the measurements are performed at relatively low protein concentrations (nm range), which reduces the risk of nonspecific aggregation.In this study we analyze the interactions between purified Hansenula polymorpha Pex5p (9Van der Klei I.J. Hilbrands R.E. Swaving G.J. Waterham H.R. Vrieling E.G. Titorenko V.I. Cregg J.M. Harder W. Veenhuis M. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and synthetic PTS1 peptides in vitro. In each experiment one of these components was fluorescently labeled and analyzed by FCS. Calculation of the diffusion constants of the fluorescent molecule allowed us to determine the oligomeric state of the individual proteins and the physical interactions between these molecules. Our studies indicate that FCS is a powerful technique to explore the dynamics of physical interactions that occur during peroxisomal matrix protein import.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptides and Proteins—Peptides PTS1 (ASKL-COOH) and Fl-PTS1 (ASSASKL-COOH covalently bound to fluorescein (Fl) at the N terminus) were purchased from Eurosequence (Groningen, the Netherlands). The concentration of Fl-PTS1 was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient ϵ 480 = 7.8 × 104m cm–1.For HpPex5p purification, a carboxyl-terminal His6-tagged version was overproduced in E. coli. A PEX5 PCR product, obtained using primers 5′-GCGCCATGGCATTTCTGGGAGGATCGG-3′and 5′-GCAGATCTTATGTCGTAGGTTTTTCGG-3′ was cloned as a 1.7-kb NcoI–BglII fragment (sites introduced by PCR) into vector pQE-60 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The resulting plasmid was designated pQE60-PEX-5-HIS6. For overproduction of carboxyl-terminal His6-tagged HpPex8p, a PEX8-HIS6 PCR product was obtained using primers 5′-CCTAGCATGCAGCCGTGGTACC-3′ and 5′-CGCAGATCTTAATTTTGCTTTTTCCTGACTCTC-3′ and cloned into vector pQE-70. The resulting plasmid was designated pQE70-PEX8-HIS6.Both plasmids (pQE60-PEX5-HIS6 and pQE70-PEX8-HIS6) were transformed to E. coli M15 (pREP4). Transformants were grown as detailed in the QIAexpressionist™. Overproduction was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubation for 3 h at 30 °C. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 300 mm NaCl, 1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, complete™ protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), 50 μg/ml DNase, and 100 μg/ml RNase and subsequently broken using a French Press. Cell debris and other insoluble material were removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 20 min). Supernatants were incubated for 1 h with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (500 mg protein/ml resin; Qiagen) followed by extensive washing with buffer A (50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm NaCl) with increasing concentrations of imidazole (up to 40 mm), followed by elution with buffer A containing 200 mm imidazole. Pex5p or Pex8p peak fractions, determined by Western blotting using anti-Pex5p or anti-Pex8p antibodies, were further purified by anion exchange chromatography (MonoQ; Amersham Biosciences) using a linear gradient of 0.1–1 m NaCl in 20 mm Bis-Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) for HpPex5p and in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) for HpPex8p. HpPex5p was further purified by gel filtration chromatography (Superose 12; Amersham Biosciences) in buffer A containing 300 mm NaCl. HpPex5p and HpPex8p were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 using the protein labeling kit of Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands) and dialyzed against buffer prior to the FCS measurements. Dialysis did not prevent the presence of residual free Alexa Fluor 488 in the samples.Analysis of the Functionality of HpPex5p-His6 and HpPex8p-His6— The functionality of carboxyl-terminal His6-tagged HpPex5p was tested by introducing the HpPEX5-HIS6 gene under control of the endogenous promoter (P PEX5) in a H. polymorpha PEX5 deletion strain (Δpex5) (9Van der Klei I.J. Hilbrands R.E. Swaving G.J. Waterham H.R. Vrieling E.G. Titorenko V.I. Cregg J.M. Harder W. Veenhuis M. J. Biol.

To this purpose the PEX5-HIS6 cassette was isolated as a 1.8-kb NcoI (blunted)-HindIII fragment from the pQE60-PEX5-HIS6 plasmid and ligated into the shuttle vector pHS5 together with a 0.5-kb BamHI (blunted) SacI PEX5 promoter fragment (BamHI site introduced by PCR). The resulting plasmid was transformed to H. polymorpha Δpex5.The functionality of carboxyl-terminal His6-tagged HpPex8p was determined by integrating the carboxyl-terminal part of the HpPEX8-HIS6 gene of pQE70-PEX8-HIS6 in H. polymorpha NCYC495 leu 1.1 in such a way that only HpPex8p-His6 is produced. To this purpose the carboxyl-terminal part of PEX8-HIS6 was isolated as a 1.3-kb HindIII fragment from pQE70-PEX8-HIS6 and ligated in vector pHS5 digested with HindIII. The resulting plasmid was linearized with MluI and transformed to H. polymorpha NCYC495 leu 1.1. Prototrophic transformants were selected. The synthesis of His6-tagged HpPex5p and His6-tagged HpPex8p in the two constructed strains was determined by Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibodies against the histidine tag (Dianova GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). In addition, these strains were tested for their ability to grow on methanol, which is indicative for normal peroxisome formation (9Van der Klei I.J. Hilbrands R.E. Swaving G.J. Waterham H.R.

The light intensity was adjusted by using various neutral density filters. As a sample carrier, a 96-well chamber was used. The pinhole was adjusted to 40 μm; the alignment and focusing of the setup were frequently checked by measuring the photon count traces of 10 nm Rhodamine 110. Autocorrelation traces were acquired during 30 or 60 s and repeated 10 times. All the experiments were conducted at room temperature. The autocorrelation curves were globally analyzed to a model consisting of diffusion and triplet state (12Widengren J. Mets Ü. Rigler R. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 13368-13379Crossref Scopus (640) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 1G(τ)=1+1〈N〉·1-T+Te-τ/τT(1-T)∑jαj·11+ττdif,j1+ωxyωz2ττdif,j(Eq. 1) where 〈N〉 is the average number of molecules, T is the fraction of molecules in the triplet state, and 1/τ T the corresponding triplet decay rate, τdif, j is the diffusion time of molecular species j, ω xy and ω z are the equatorial and axial radii of the confocal volume set up by the laser beam, and ω z /ω xy is the structural parameter. Equation 1 is written in a multicomponent form with α j the fraction of molecular species j. In Equation 1 it is assumed that all species have the same triplet characteristics and molecular brightness. The dimensions of the confocal detection volume and the structural parameter are obtained from global analysis of the autocorrelation curves of the standard Rhodamine 110 in water having a diffusion constant of 280 μm2s–1 (13Magde D. Elson E.L. Webb W.W. Biopolymers. 1974; 13: 29-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar).In global analysis several correlation functions are combined in one data set and simultaneously fitted with certain parameters linked over the set, ensuring more reliable parameter recovery and thus more consistent representation of the physical processes under investigation (14Beechem J.M. Gratton E. Ameloot M. Knutson J.R. Brand L. Lakowicz J.R. Topics in Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Vol. 2. Plenum Press, New York1991: 241Google Scholar). All the experimental autocorrelation curves were globally fitted by the theoretical autocorrelation function given in Equation 1 using the FCS data processor 1.3 of the Scientific Software Technologies Center of Belarusian State University, Belarus. The quality of the fits and performance of the optimization methods was improved by fixing the parameters that are known a priori from independent experiments (for instance, free Alexa Fluor 488).The relation between diffusion time and diffusion constant is shown in Equation 2. τdif=ωxy24D(Eq. 2) In Tables I and II diffusion constants D are used, because these are absolute numbers independent of the size of the confocal detection volume. The diffusion coefficient of a spherical particle scales inversely to the hydrodynamic radius rh of the particle according to the Stokes-Einstein relation as shown in Equation 3rh=kT6πηD(Eq. 3) where η is the viscosity, T the absolute temperature, and k the Boltzmann constant. Assuming that rh of the particle is proportional to the cubic root of its molecular mass M, D can be rewritten as shown in Equation 4.

Shimizu N. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 1639-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), ranging from monomers to tetramers, we initiated our studies by analyzing the oligomeric state of Pex5p. To facilitate purification, a carboxyl-terminal His6-tagged version of H. polymorpha Pex5p (HpPex5p) was overproduced in E. coli. The His6-tagged HpPex5p was fully functional because synthesis of this protein in a H. polymorpha PEX5 deletion strain fully restored the capacity of the cells to grow on methanol (data not shown).Purified HpPex5p was labeled with the fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 488, which enabled us to follow the fate of the protein in solution using FCS. In Fig. 1 examples of three autocorrelation curves (of ten) are shown together with fitted curves and residuals. The autocorrelation curves were fitted globally to a diffusion model including triplet kinetics (see “Experimental Procedures”). The best fit was achieved when a two-component diffusion model was used, where the diffusion time of free Alexa Fluor 488 was fixed to the earlier estimated value. A rigorous error analysis at a confidence interval of 67% for the diffusion time of HpPex5p was performed (14Beechem J.M. Gratton E. Ameloot M. Knutson J.R. Brand L. Lakowicz J.R. Topics in Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Vol. 2. Plenum Press, New York1991: 241Google Scholar). The diffusion constant of HpPex5p at pH 7.2 (see Fig. 1A) appeared to be 38 μm2s–1 (with confidence limits 36–41 μm2s–1). This diffusion constant corresponds to a molecular mass of ∼250 kDa (198–312 kDa), assuming that the protein has a globular shape (see Equation 4 under “Experimental Procedures”). Because the molecular mass of HpPex5p calculated from its amino acid sequence amounts to 63.9 kDa (9Van der Klei I.J. Hilbrands R.E. Swaving G.J. Waterham H.R. Vrieling E.G. Titorenko V.I. Cregg J.M. Harder W. Veenhuis M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17229-17236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we conclude that the protein formed tetramers under the prevailing experimental conditions. At pH 6.0 (Fig. 1B), the diffusion constant of HpPex5p increased to a value that corresponds to a molecular mass of 61 kDa (48–83 kDa), indicative of a monomeric conformation. These data indicate that the oligomeric state of HpPex5p is dependent on the pH and varies within a relatively small pH interval.PTS1 Peptides Predominantly Bind to Tetrameric HpPex5p— In order to study binding of a peptide containing the consensus sequence (SKL) of the PTS1, a chemically synthesized peptide (ASSASKL) was labeled with fluorescein (Fl-PTS1). Autocorrelation curves in the presence and absence of HpPex5p were collected. These experiments were conducted at two different pH values. In Fig. 2A three autocorrelation curves (of ten) are shown together with fitted curves and residuals for Fl-PTS1 at pH 7.2. A single diffusion constant of 224 μm2s–1 (206–239 μm2s–1) was obtained at pH 7.2 (Fig. 2A). At pH 6.0, a similar value was obtained (data not shown). In Fig. 2B the same set of curves is presented for Fl-PTS1 in the presence of HpPex5p at pH 7.2. The best fit was obtained when a two-component diffusion model was used in which the diffusion time of free Fl-PTS1 was fixed in the analysis. In the presence of HpPex5p the autocorrelation curve shifted to longer diffusion times, indicating binding of the peptide to a larger molecule (Fig. 2B legend and Table I). At the experimental conditions used, the two-component diffusion model revealed that 14% of the peptide was bound to HpPex5p. The diffusion constant of the bound PTS1 peptide corresponded to a molecular mass of ∼277 kDa, indicating that it was bound to tetrameric HpPex5p. In an identical experiment performed at pH 6.0 (data not shown), only the short diffusion time corresponding to free Fl-PTS1 was observed, and no additional diffusion time could be distinguished. This indicates that no significant binding of the PTS1 peptide to HpPex5p occurs at this pH.Fig. 2Examples of experimental autocorrelation curve (dots), fitted (solid line), and residuals (upper inset) of Fl-PTS1 in the absence (A) or presence (B) of HpPex5p at pH 7.2. The concentration of Fl-PTS1 was 50 nm. HpPex5p was used at a concentration of 10 nm. After global analysis of 10 experimental curves to the model of Equation 1, the following parameters were obtained. A, one-component fit: τ t = 3.1 μs, T ≈ 10%; Fl-PTS1-free τdif = 80 μs (75–86 μs). B, two-component fit: τ t = 1.7 μs, T ≈ 10%; Fl-PTS1-free τdif = 80 μs (fixed); HpPex5p τdif = 479 μs (424–521 μs).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In control experiments performed at both pH values using purified HpPex8p (see below), only the short diffusion time of the free peptide could be recovered. Hence, the PTS1 peptide specifically binds to HpPex5p but not to HpPex8p.HpPex5p Interacts with HpPex8p—So far, no data have been reported on the oligomeric state of Pex8p. To facilitate purification, His6-tagged HpPex8p was overproduced in E. coli. The functionality of the tagged protein was analyzed using a constructed strain that produces only the His6-tagged version of Pex8p under control of the endogenous promoter. Cells of this strain grew normally on methanol, indicating that the protein was fully functional (data not shown).Purified HpPex8p was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488. Experimental autocorrelation curves of labeled HpPex8p were obtained at different pH values. These curves fitted best with a two-component diffusion model, one corresponding to free Alexa Fluor 488 and the other to Alexa Fluor 488-labeled HpPex8p (data not shown). After applying the same strategy of analysis as described above, the diffusion constants presented in Table II were recovered. The molecular mass of HpPex8p, calculated from the diffusion constant, amounted to 60 (pH 8.0)-73 kDa (pH 6), which is similar to the mass calculated from its amino acid composition (77 kDa) (10Waterham H.R. Titorenko V.I. Haima P. Cregg J.M. Harder W. Veenhuis M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We therefore conclude that purified HpPex8p occurs as a monomer independent of the pH.Upon addition of excess unlabeled HpPex5p to the Alexa Fluor 488-labeled HpPex8p solution (at pH 7.2), again a good two-component fit was obtained. After fixing the diffusion time of free Alexa Fluor 488 dye, a diffusion constant of ∼49 μm2s–1 was obtained (Table II). This value corresponds to a molecular mass of ∼127 kDa and suggests the formation of heterodimeric complexes of HpPex8p and HpPex5p. Under these conditions (i.e. a 10-fold molar excess of HpPex5p), most HpPex8p was bound to HpPex5p. Similar results were obtained when the experiments were performed at pH 6.0 or 8.0 (Table II).Upon addition of excess (500 nm) unlabeled HpPex8p to the mixture, the diffusion constant increased again (data not shown), indicating that indeed the high molecular mass species represented dimers consisting of labeled HpPex8p and unlabeled HpPex5p. Addition of labeled HpPex8p (50 nm) to a mixture of HpPex5p (500 nm) and PTS1 peptide (5 μm) resulted in a similar autocorrelation curve, indicating that the presence of PTS1 peptide did not influence the HpPex5p-HpPex8p interaction (Table II).HpPex8p Causes Dissociation of the HpPex5p-PTS1 Peptide Complex—Next we tested whether HpPex8p affected binding of PTS1 peptide to HpPex5p. To test this, unlabeled HpPex8p (300 nm) was added to a mixture of unlabeled HpPex5p (10 nm) and fluorescein-labeled PTS1 peptide (50 nm) preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The experimental autocorrelation curves were best fitted with a two-component diffusion model, corresponding to free peptide and peptide bound to tetrameric HpPex5p. No significant amounts of the Fl-PTS1 peptide bound to HpPex5p-HpPex8p heterodimers could be detected. The addition of HpPex8p resulted in a decrease in the fraction of PTS1 peptide bound to tetrameric HpPex5p. At the experimental conditions used, the fraction of bound peptide decreased to 9% (compare with 14% that was bound in the absence of HpPex8p; Table I).DISCUSSIONIn this study we used FCS to study physical interactions of two peroxins, Pex5p and Pex8p, involved in peroxisomal matrix protein import. A wealth of experimental data has been reported showing peroxin-peroxin and receptor-PTS interactions (reviewed in Ref. 1Purdue P.E. Lazarow P.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 701-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). However, the techniques used (e.g. yeast two-hybrid analysis, co-immune precipitation, surface plasmon resonance analysis) do not allow determination of the stoichiometry or kinetics of these interactions. Here we show that FCS is a powerful tool to assess the dynamics of peroxin interactions. FCS is generally used to study binding of small ligands to relatively large structures (proteins, membranes). We show that FCS is also suitable to study the interactions of proteins of comparable molecular mass (e.g. HpP"

Although p21 was necessary for the G1/S block, the G1 cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) cyclin E-Cdk2 and cyclin D-Cdk4 remained active. Despite the activity of the G1 Cdks the retinoblastoma protein was hypophosphorylated due to unknown mechanisms that were dependent on the p21 protein. The resulting decrease in cyclin A mRNA and protein led to a decrease in the activity of cyclin A-Cdk2. Therefore, although p21 was required for the G1/S arrest of HCT116 colon cancer cells by mevastatin, its mode of action was more complicated than the simple formation of a physical complex with cyclin-Cdk2. This mechanism of inhibition is different from that seen in prostate cancer cells (Ukomadu, C., and Dutta, A. (2003) J. Biol.

The inhibitors of the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, have been used for more than 2 decades as first line agents for management of hypercholesterolemia (1Retterstol K.

In recent years it has become obvious that these drugs, collectively known as statins, affect additional biological processes. They have been used as anti-inflammatory molecules with potential therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and experimental encephalomyelitis (2Greenwood J. Walters C.E. Pryce G.

Lutjohann D. Moore C. Svetlik D. Arch. Neurol. 2003; 60: 510-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These drugs have also been shown to have growth-deterrent effects in a number of normal and cancer cell lines (5Rao S. Lowe M. Herliczek T.W. Keyomarsi K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2393-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 6Keyomarsi K. Sandoval L. Band V. Pardee A.B.

Investig. New Drugs. 2001; 19: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Because they block a proximal step in cholesterol synthesis, a logical explanation for the growth-altering effects was inhibition of isoprenylation of key regulatory proteins (Ras, Rap, etc.) with their subsequent defective subcellular localization. However, experiments done with lovastatin showed that inhibition of Cdk2 1The abbreviations used are: Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; Rb, retinoblastoma protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; CBP, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein.1The abbreviations used are: Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; Rb, retinoblastoma protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; CBP, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein. through a Ras-independent pathway accounted for the growth-inhibitory effects (8DeClue J.E. Vass W.C. Papageorge A.G. Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 712-717PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have focused on how statins inhibit Cdk2 activity. Because growth inhibition has been accompanied by an induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and/or p27 (9Rao S. Gray-Bablin J. Herliczek T.W. Keyomarsi K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the growth-deterrent effects are believed to result from the induction of these proteins and subsequent inhibition of Cdk2. While some experiments have suggested that the statins elevate cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor by acting as proteasome inhibitors (10Rao S. Porter D.C. Chen X. Herliczek T. Lowe M. Keyomarsi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7797-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) others have suggested that statins act by transcriptional activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (11Lee S.J. Ha M.J. Lee J. Nguyen P. Choi Y.H. Pirnia F. Kang W.K. Wang X.F. Kim S.J. Trepel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10618-10623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In a recent study on PC3 cells, mevastatin inhibited Cdk2 activity by preventing its activating phosphorylation despite depletion of p21 by siRNA transfection (12Ukomadu C. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4840-4846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting that alternative targets exist for the antiproliferative effects of these drugs. Although it is clear that this group of drugs has potent antiproliferative effects, there has not been a careful search for lineage-specific effects in the molecular mechanism of inhibition of cell proliferation.The studies reported here evaluated the molecular mechanism of inhibition of colon cancer cell proliferation by mevastatin. Mevastatin, an analog of lovastatin, led to a G1 block and lack of proliferation in HCT116 cells. We have conclusive genetic evidence that p21, but not the related cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p27 or p57, is responsible for this effect in HCT116 cells. Although p21 was absolutely required for the inhibitory effect of mevastatin, the inhibition of the kinase activity cannot be accounted for simply by the increased association of p21 with cyclin-Cdk2. In HCT116 cells suppressed by mevastatin, cyclin D-Cdk4 and cyclin E-Cdk2 activities were present in vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly retinoblastoma protein (Rb) was underphosphorylated in vivo despite the activity of cyclin D- and E-associated kinases. These results confirm the requirement for p21 in HCT116 cells but suggest that hypophosphorylation of Rb is effected by p21 without direct inhibition of G1 Cdks through complex formation. These results also underscore the different mode of action of mevastatin in the HCT116 colon cancer cells compared with that in the previously studied PC3 prostate cancer cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials, Cell Culture, and Flow Cytometry—PC3 cells were from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). The cells were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. HCT116 cells (wild type and p21-deficient) were the kind gift of Dr. Bert Vogelstein (The Johns Hopkins University). Cells were grown as described previously (13Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

All experiments described below were performed with cells harvested 48 h after mevastatin treatment except where otherwise stated.Mevastatin (compactin) and roscovitine were from Sigma and were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO).

Interestingly depletion of p21 in PC3 cells by siRNA transfection did not prevent mevastatin-induced inhibition (12Ukomadu C. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4840-4846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We evaluated the role of p21 in the statin-induced inhibition of HCT116 colon cancer cell proliferation. For these experiments, we used HCT116 cells that are either wild type for p21 (p21+/+) or deficient in p21 (p21–/–) (13Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar, 14Waldman T. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1996; 381: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 10 μm mevastatin and subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (Table I) or 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide proliferation assay (Fig. 1, A and B). By 36 h after treatment with mevastatin, a prominent G1 block was present in p21+/+ cells but not in p21–/– HCT116 cells (Table I). Furthermore the proliferation of p21-containing cells was inhibited by mevastatin, while that of p21-deficient cells was unaffected (Fig. 1, A and B). Parallel tritiated thymidine experiments also showed that thymidine incorporation was inhibited only in the p21+/+ cells (not shown). These findings suggest that, in the colon cancer cell line HCT116, p21 is required for mevastatin-induced inhibition of cell proliferation.Table Ip21 is required for the antiproliferative effects of mevastatin24 h36 hG0-G1SG2-MG0-G1SG2-M%p21 +/+aHCT116 cells wild type for p21.UNTbUNT, cells in the absence of mevastatin.46.036.517.554.934.510.6MEVcMEV, cells in the presence of mevastatin.48.631.220.272.911.615.5p21 -/-dHCT116 cells null for p21.UNT38.740.920.439.941.418.7MEV40.039.320.749.249.215.8a HCT116 cells wild type for p21.b UNT, cells in the absence of mevastatin.c MEV, cells in the presence of mevastatin.d HCT116 cells null for p21. Open table in a new tab Cdk2 Is Not Inhibited by Mevastatin in p21-deficient HCT116 Cells—We next evaluated whether Cdk2 kinase is inhibited in a p21-dependent manner. Fig. 2A shows an immunoblot of lysates from p21+/+ and p21–/– HCT116 cells. As expected, the level of Cdk2 remained constant in both cell lines with or without mevastatin treatment. p21 was induced in p21+/+ cells in the presence of mevastatin and was absent in the p21-deficient cells. Immunoprecipitation with antibodies to Cdk2 (Fig. 2B) showed a very minor increase in associated p21 along with a dramatic inhibition of kinase activity. Although both p27 and p57 were present in p21–/– cells they did not substitute for the role of p21 in the inhibition of Cdk2 or cell proliferation. At face value, these results might be interpreted as showing that the induction of p21 and association with Cdk2 is responsible for the inhibition of Cdk2 and G1/S block. As will become obvious with further exploration, this is not the case.Fig. 2Abundance of cell cycle-regulated proteins and Cdk2 complex analysis of mevastatin-treated HCT116 cells. A, immunoblot analysis of lysates from p21+/+ and p21–/– HCT116 cells. Cdk2, p27, and p57 levels remain constant in both p21-sufficient and -deficient HCT116 cells. With mevastatin treatment there is an enhanced level of p21. Note the expected absence of p21 in p21–/– cells. B, the Cdk2 complex in HCT116 cells. 200 μg of cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with an anti-Cdk2 antibody. Immunoblots with Cdk2 (top panel) show a constant level of Cdk2 precipitated in mevastatin-treated or untreated p21-sufficient or -deficient cells. In the middle panel, a small increase in p21 associated with Cdk2 is noted with mevastatin treatment. The activity of the resulting complex (bottom panel) shows the loss of kinase activity in p21+/+ cells but retained activity in p21–/– following mevastatin treatment. C, immunoblot of cell lysates treated with or without mevastatin and transfected with either control siRNA (GL2) or p21-targeted siRNA (p21-2). The top panel shows Cdk2 content as a loading control, while the middle panel shows p21 levels. Note the significant reduction of p21 in mevastatin-treated and p21-2-transfected cells (compare lanes 2 and 4). p27 content is unaffected (bottom panel). D, p21 content of Cdk2 complex following siRNA transfection. Lysates from C were immunoprecipitated with an antibody to Cdk2. The top panel is loading control (Cdk2), while the middle panel is the p21 content of the various immunoprecipitates. There is significant reduction in the p21 content of Cdk2 in mevastatin-treated, p21-2-transfected cells. The kinase activity is enhanced with p21 depletion (bottom panel).

Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4840-4846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to confirm the p21 requirement for the effect of mevastatin in HCT116 cells by acute depletion of p21 using RNA interference. Fig. 2C (middle panel) shows that the transfected oligonucleotide could decrease p21 effectively in HCT116 cells even in the presence of mevastatin. In contrast a control siRNA did not reduce p21 levels or inhibit the mevastatin-induced enhancement of p21. In addition, p21 depletion did not lead to enhancement of p27 levels (bottom panel). Quantitative Western blots suggested a 5–10-fold decrease in p21 levels in mevastatin-treated, p21 siRNA-transfected cells compared with mevastatin-treated, control siRNA-transfected cells. Immunoprecipitation of transfected cell lysates with anti-Cdk2 antibody also showed a significant decrease in associated p21 (Fig. 2D, middle panel, compare lanes 2 and 4). Kinase assays against histone H1 showed that this decrease in p21 leads to the persistence of kinase activity in the presence of mevastatin (Fig. 2D, bottom panel, compare lanes 2 and 4). Therefore, contrary to the results in PC3 cells, p21 is indeed required in HCT116 cells for the antiproliferative effect of mevastatin.The Inhibitory Effect of Mevastatin in HCT116 Cells Is Due to Enhancement of p21 mRNA Levels Not Stabilization of p21 Protein—Two mechanisms have been proposed for the increase in p21 protein levels in cultured cells following treatment with statins. In PC3 cells, mRNA levels are elevated following mevastatin. 2C. Ukomadu and A. Dutta, unpublished. In addition p21 promoter deletion experiments performed in PC3-M cells have identified a segment of the promoter responsible for the lovastatin-induced enhancement of p21 mRNA (11Lee S.J. Ha M.J. Lee J. Nguyen P. Choi Y.H. Pirnia F. Kang W.K. Wang X.F. Kim S.J. Trepel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10618-10623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Experiments in MOA-MB-157 cells, however, have suggested that p21 levels are enhanced because lovastatin acts as an inhibitor of the proteasome leading to greater protein stability (10Rao S. Porter D.C. Chen X. Herliczek T. Lowe M. Keyomarsi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7797-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). We performed experiments to evaluate which of these mechanisms accounted for the elevated levels of p21 in HCT116 cells following mevastatin treatment. As shown in Fig. 3A, treatment of p21+/+ cells with mevastatin led to an increase in p21 mRNA levels. No p21 was detected in p21-deficient cells with or without mevastatin. Fig. 3B shows pulsechase experiments of [35S]methionine-labeled p21 in the presence and absence of mevastatin. There was no detectable change in the half-life of p21 with mevastatin treatment suggesting that the mechanism of p21 enhancement in HCT116 cells is by increasing the p21 mRNA level and is not due to stabilization of the p21 protein.Fig. 3Mechanism of p21 enhancement in mevastatin treated cells. A, Northern blot of p21+/+ and p21–/– HCT116 cells. Treatment with mevastatin results in higher levels of p21 mRNA (top panel). There is no detectable signal in the p21-deficient cells. The loading control (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)) is shown in the bottom panel. B, pulse-chase of metabolically labeled p21 in p21+/+ cells (without mevastatin (left) and with mevastatin (right)). The time course of p21 in treated and untreated cells is similar.

Fig. 4A shows immunoblots of whole cell lysates at specific times following mevastatin treatment. In both cell lines (HCT116 p21–/– and p21+/+) the levels of cyclin E remained relatively constant (top panel). In contrast, the amount of cyclin A declined within 48 h in the p21-sufficient cells but not in the p21-deficient HCT116 cells (bottom panel). This would suggest either a p21-dependent effect on the cyclin A protein or cyclin A mRNA. In Northern blots performed on lysates 48 h after mevastatin addition, the level of cyclin E mRNA remained constant, while there was a suppression of cyclin A mRNA in HCT116 p21+/+ cells (Fig. 4B). In p21–/– HCT116 cells we observed continued expression of cyclin A mRNA. Therefore, cyclin A transcription is not directly suppressed by mevastatin, but a p21-dependent activity is required for the suppression. Because cyclin A transcription is dependent on E2F (17Schulze A. Zerfass K. Spitkovsky D. Middendorp S. Berges J. Helin K. Jansen-Durr P. Henglein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11264-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) we wondered whether the inhibition of cyclin E-Cdk2 and the subsequent underphosphorylation of Rb explains the decrease in cyclin A mRNA and protein levels in mevastatin-treated p21+/+ cells.Fig. 4Abundance of cyclin A and E proteins and RNAs following mevastatin treatment. A,30 μg of total cell lysate obtained at the noted times after mevastatin treatment was loaded per lane and analyzed by immunoblot with either anti-cyclin E or anti-cyclin A antibodies. While cyclin E levels remain fairly constant in both cell lines (top), cyclin A levels in the p21+/+ cells are decreased by 48 h (bottom). The levels of cyclin A in p21–/– HCT116 cells remain constant. B, Northern blot analysis for cyclin E and A in mevastatin-treated cells shows that the levels of cyclin E remain constant in both p21-containing and -deficient cells (panel 1). Cyclin A mRNA levels are only decreased in p21+/+ cells treated with mevastatin (panel 3, lane 2). The levels remain unchanged in mevastatin-treated p21–/– cells. Note that cyclin A mRNA resolves as two transcripts as reported previously (25Henglein B. Chenivesse X. Wang J. Eick D. Brechot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5490-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar).

As expected there was no decrease in cyclin E- or A-associated kinase activities in p21–/– cells following mevastatin treatment. Thus the inhibition of in vitro kinase in the Cdk2 immunoprecipitates from p21+/+ HCT116 cells (Fig. 2B) is accounted for mostly by the lack of cyclin A and is not due to inhibition of cyclin E-Cdk2 kinase.Fig. 5Discrepancy between cyclin E-Cdk2 activity from PC3 cells and HCT116 cells. A, immunoprecipitation with cyclin E and A antibodies of lysates from HCT116 cells (p21+/+ and p21–/–). While the cyclin A fraction is significantly inhibited in the p21+/+ cells, it is not in the p21–/– cells. There is only a minimal loss of cyclin E-Cdk2 activity in p21+/+ HCT116 cells treated with mevastatin (bottom panel, lane 2). B, time course of cyclin E-Cdk2 inhibition in mevastatin-treated PC3 and HCT116 cells. UNT represents activity in the absence of mevastatin, while the numbers 24, 36, and 48 represents hours of incubation in 10 μm mevastatin. Note that while there is complete lack of kinase activity at 48 h in PC3 cells, there is significant retention of kinase activity by 48 h in HCT116 cells. C, quantitation of activity of cyclin E-Cdk2 from PC3 and HCT116 cells. Immunoprecipitates of lysates from mevastatin-treated PC3 and HCT116 cells were assayed for kinase activity. After SDS-PAGE the histone H1 band was excised, and incorporated 32P was determined by scintillation counting. The bar graph presents the activity of the cyclin E-Cdk2 complex from mevastatin cells as a fraction of the activity of the kinase from untreated cells. While there is a significant decrease in the activity of cyclin E-Cdk2 from mevastatin-treated PC3 cells, there is a minimal effect on the activity of cyclin E-Cdk2 from HCT116 cells. Error bars are standard deviations of an average of three experiments. MEV, mevastatin; IP, immunoprecipitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Interestingly in PC3 cells both cyclin E- and cyclin A-associated Cdk2 activity was inhibited by mevastatin (12Ukomadu C. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4840-4846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Fig. 5B further illustrates this discrepancy between cyclin E-Cdk2 from mevastatin-treated PC3 and HCT116 cells. While there was complete loss of kinase activity in PC3 cells by 36 h after mevastatin treatment, greater than 70% of the cyclin E-Cdk2 activity remained in HCT116 cells. Fig. 5C quantitates this difference in inhibition of cyclin E-Cdk2 from PC3 or HCT116 cells following treatment with mevastatin.This difference in the histone H1 kinase activity of Cdk2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2B) versus cyclin E immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5, A–C) from mevastatin-treated HCT116 cells is intriguing. In contrast to complete loss of activity in the Cdk2 immunoprecipitates, significant activity was retained in the cyclin E immunoprecipitate. This difference was confirmed with antibodies to Cdk2 and cyclin E from different sources. We suggest that the anti-Cdk2 antibodies preferentially immunoprecipitate free Cdk2 that is not complexed with any cyclin. Since free Cdk2 was enriched in mevastatin-treated cells because of suppression of cyclin A transcripts, it appears that all the kinase activity is lost upon mevastatin treatment in Fig. 2B. The cyclin E immunoprecipitation in Fig. 5 selectively isolated only Cdk2 complexed with cyclin E and eliminates free Cdk2 and thus accurately portrays the residual activity of the cyclin E-Cdk2 complex upon mevastatin treatment.Mevastatin Treatment Leads to Underphosphorylation of Rb in Vivo Despite Retained in Vitro Cyclin E-Cdk2 Activity—We next focused on why cyclin E-Cdk2 activity in vitro was normal but the cell cycle was blocked. One possibility was that cyclin E-Cdk2 activity on a relevant substrate in vivo was inhibited despite the in vitro activity against histone H1. The state of phosphorylation of Rb was examined following mevastatin treatment (Fig. 6A). In the top panel equal amounts of lysates from mevastatin-treated and untreated cells were analyzed by immunoblots using an antibody that recognizes hyper- and hypophosphorylated forms of Rb. In p21+/+ HCT116 cells, the slowly migrating band corresponding to the hyperphosphorylated Rb was lost with mevastatin treatment. In p21–/– cells Rb remained hyperphosphorylated corresponding to a failure of mevastatin to block the cell cycle. To further illustrate this, we performed parallel immunoblots with an antibody that specifically recognizes the hyperphosphorylated form of Rb. Fig. 6A (lower panel) confirms that hyperphosphorylation of Rb was inhibited by mevastatin treatment of the p21+/+ HCT116 cell line. Thus mevastatin effectively prevents Rb phosphorylation in vivo, although cyclin E-Cdk2 is active in vitro.Fig. 6Phosphorylation of Rb and kinase activity of cyclin D-Cdk4. A, Rb is hypophosphorylated in vivo despite in vitro activity of cyclin E-Cdk2 from HCT116 cells. 30 μg of cellular lysate from p21+/+ and p21–/– cell lines was immunoblotted with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the hypo- and hyperphosphorylated forms of Rb (top panel) or with an antibody that recognizes only the hyperphosphorylated form of Rb (bottom panel). Phospho-Rb is not present in mevastatin-treated p21+/+ HCT116 cells. B, complex composition and kinase activity of cyclin D-Cdk4 in HCT116 cells. Western immunoblot of 30 μg of cellular lysate shows no difference in abundance of cyclin D1 or Cdk4 in the presence or absence of mevastatin (left).

https://openalex.org/W2074469961,"Yeast are capable of modifying their metabolism in response to environmental changes. We investigated the activity of the oxygen-dependent high-affinity iron uptake system of Saccharomyces cerevisiae under conditions of heme depletion. We found that the absence of heme, due to a deletion in the gene that encodes δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase (HEM1), resulted in decreased transcription of genes belonging to both the iron and copper regulons, but not the zinc regulon. Decreased transcription of the iron regulon was not due to decreased expression of the iron sensitive transcriptional activator Aft1p. Expression of the constitutively active allele AFT1-1up was unable to induce transcription of the high affinity iron uptake system in heme-depleted cells. We demonstrated that under heme-depleted conditions, Aft1p-GFP was able to cycle normally between the nucleus and cytosol in response to cytosolic iron. Despite the inability to induce transcription under low iron conditions, chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that Aft1p binds to the FET3 promoter in the absence of heme. Finally, we provide evidence that under heme-depleted conditions, yeast are able to regulate mitochondrial iron uptake and do not accumulate pathologic iron concentrations, as is seen when iron-sulfur cluster synthesis is disrupted.

The insolubility of Fe3+ in aqueous solution and the toxicity of iron-generated oxygen radicals has led to the assumption that the use of iron in biochemical reactions initially occurred in an anaerobic environment. While many iron-requiring biochemical reactions in bacteria occur anaerobically, most eukaryotic iron-requiring biochemical reactions involve electron-mediated oxygen binding or transfer. Examples of these reactions include nucleic acid reduction, lipid desaturation, and sterol synthesis (1Gollub E.G. Liu K.P. Dayan J. Adlersberg M. Sprinson D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2846-2854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such reactions do not occur anaerobically, and yeast have developed non iron-dependent alternatives (e.g. ribonucleic acid reduction). Other reactions, (ergosterol synthesis) do not occur in the absence of oxygen and yeast become auxotrophic for the products of those reactions (1Gollub E.G. Liu K.P. Dayan J. Adlersberg M. Sprinson D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2846-2854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast also show a reduced ability to accumulate iron anaerobically, as the activity of the high-affinity iron transport system is oxygen-dependent (2Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Many of the genes that encode iron-dependent enzymes are regulated by heme-sensing transcriptional activators (Hap1p, Hap2,3,4,5 complex) or repressors (Rox1p, Mot3p) (3Kwast K.E. Burke P.V. Poyton R.O. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 1177-1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this communication we demonstrate that in the absence of heme, transcription of the iron and copper regulons is inhibited, while the zinc regulon is unaffected. Mitochondria are the site of two critical points in iron metabolism: the iron chelation step of heme biosynthesis, and Fe-S cluster synthesis. Inhibition of Fe-S cluster synthesis or export in either yeast or mammals leads to excessive mitochondrial iron accumulation (for review, see Ref. 4Lill R. Diekert K. Kaut A. Lange H. Pelzer W. Prohl C. Kispal G. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In humans with sideroblastic anemia, inhibition of heme biosynthesis has been shown to result in pathological iron accumulation in the mitochondria of erythroid precursor cells (for review, see Ref. 5Fleming M.D. Semin. Hematol. 2002; 39: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that inhibition of heme biosynthesis in yeast prevents transcription of the high-affinity iron transport system, precluding mitochondrial iron accumulation.

(Frontier Scientific, Logan, UT). To deplete heme, cells were washed three times in an equal volume of H2O, and re-inoculated into media containing a source of unsaturated fatty acids, sterols, and methionine (TEM media). 100× Tween/ergosterol supplement was made by mixing 50:50 ethanol/Tween 80; followed by addition of ergosterol to final concentration of 1.2 mg/ml. 500× methionine stock was made at 27.8 mg/ml. Cells were grown for 10 h in TEM to deplete heme before being used in experiments. An alternative approach to deplete heme was to incubate Δhem1 cells in low (0.5 μg/ml) concentrations of ALA. β-Galactosidase Reporter Assay—A β-galactosidase reporter construct containing the promoter sequence of FET3 has been described previously (6Li L.

Subcellular Localization of Aft1p—An amino terminus GFP epitope-tagged Aft1p was constructed in the high copy pRS426 under control of the AFT1 promoter (1000 bp). This plasmid was sequence-verified and complemented a Δaft1 cell strain (data not shown). Cells were grown in CM media in the presence of either ALA or TEM. After 10 h of growth, either 50 μm FeSO4 or 80 μm BPS was added to the cell cultures. 10 μl samples of live cells in mid-log phase were mounted onto slides for microscopy.

The High-affinity Iron Transport System Is Inactive in the Absence of Heme—We examined the effect of mutations in the heme biosynthetic pathway on cellular iron uptake to define the relationship between heme synthesis and cellular iron metabolism. Yeast with a mutation in HEM1, which encodes aminolevulinic acid synthase, can be maintained through the addition of high concentrations of aminolevulinic acid (ALA). Removal of ALA results in the loss of heme, and the cells become auxotrophic for unsaturated fatty acids, ergosterol, and methionine (12Grimal D. Labbe-Bois R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 178: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In the absence of high concentrations of ALA (50 μg/ml), Δhem1 cells can be depleted of heme by incubation in media containing low ALA (0.5 μg/ml); a concentration of ALA that preserves cell viability (14Thorsness M. Schafer W. D'Ari L. Rine J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 5702-5712Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). If the products of the heme-dependent reactions are supplied, (Tween 80, a source of unsaturated fatty acids; ergosterol; and methionine, TEM), Δhem1 cells can grow fairly normally in liquid media for extended periods of time. Growth of heme-depleted cells in TEM media, however, is highly strain-dependent (13Gaisne M. Becam A.M. Verdiere J. Herbert C.J. Curr. Genet. 1999; 36: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The strains employed in this study are from a W303 background and are capable of growing in the absence of heme in TEM media. Loss of heme can be demonstrated through use of a reporter construct containing the promoter region of the HMG2 gene. HMG2 encodes a hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase that is induced under anaerobic conditions. Expression of this gene is inhibited by the presence of heme. The data in Fig. 1A confirms previous studies (14Thorsness M. Schafer W. D'Ari L. Rine J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 5702-5712Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which demonstrate that when Δhem1 cells are grown in the absence of ALA (TEM media) cellular heme concentration decreases and HMG2 is induced. Depletion of at least a regulatory pool of heme is rapid, as there is a constant rate of β-galactosidase accumulation after only 2 h of incubation in ALA-free media. Even though there is a dramatic change in HMG2 transcription under heme-depleted conditions, there is little change in cell growth. As shown in Fig. 1B, there is no difference in growth rate of Δhem1 cells grown in either ALA or TEM. When Δhem1 cells were not supplemented with either ALA or TEM, growth was significantly impaired. Wild-type and Δhem1 cells grown in high ALA showed similar induction in iron transport when media is made iron-limited (data not shown). However, when Δhem1 cells were grown in TEM media, there was minimal induction of the high-affinity iron transport system in response to iron deprivation (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained when cells were incubated in low ALA to deplete heme (data not shown). The high-affinity iron transport system is comprised of a multicopper oxidase (Fet3p), and a transmembrane permease (Ftr1p) (15Askwith C.C. de Silva D. Kaplan J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Expression of these proteins is regulated by the iron-sensing transcription factor Aft1p (17Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Analysis of FET3 mRNA by S1 ribonuclease protection assay showed that Δhem1 cells placed in low ALA and low iron demonstrate a reduced level of transcripts (Fig. 1D). In addition to a lack of FET3 mRNA, there was decreased expression of mRNA for FIT1, which encodes a GPI-linked cell wall protein that is another member of the iron regulon (18Protchenko O. Ferea T. Rashford J. Tiedeman J. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49244-49250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A similar inhibition of iron transport activity and FET3 transcription was seen using a Δhem15 strain. HEM15 encodes ferrochelatase, which catalyzes the final step in the heme biosynthetic process: the insertion of Fe2+ into the porphyrin macrocycle. Δhem15 cells can be grown in the presence of heme. Upon removal of heme, there was no induction of the high-affinity iron transport system when cells are placed in iron-free media (data not shown). The decrease in FET3 and FIT1 transcript levels in the absence of heme can be explained by either reduced transcription or decreased mRNA stability. We utilized a FET3-LacZ reporter construct to determine whether the absence of heme affects FET3 transcription. Δhem1 cells grown in high ALA-containing media, showed a robust expression of β-galactosidase when incubated in low iron media (Fig. 2A). In the absence of ALA, however, there was a significant reduction in β-galactosidase activity in iron-limited Δhem1 cells. To determine if the absence of heme affects the expression of genes involved in the metabolism of other metals, we utilized metal-sensitive reporter constructs. The absence of heme-reduced induction of genes regulated by the copper regulon, as shown by decreased β-galactosidase induction in cells containing a copper-sensitive CTR1-LacZ reporter construct (Fig. 2B). Conversely, there was little inhibition of zinc-regulated genes in heme-depleted cells, as shown through use of a zinc-sensitive ZRT1-LacZ reporter construct (Fig. 2C). Inductively coupled plasma atomic absorption spectrometry was performed to determine metal concentrations of Δhem1 cells under different growth conditions. Consistent with the lack of induction the iron and copper regulons, there was a decrease in the metal concentration of iron and copper in heme-depleted cells when compared with either wild-type cells or Δhem1 cells grown in high ALA (Fig. 3). There was no significant difference in zinc concentration between the wild-type cells and the Δhem1 cells. Synthesis and Translocation of Aft1p Is Not Affected by Heme Depletion—We considered the possibility that heme-depleted cells are functionally AFT1 null due to lack of synthesis of Aft1p. Analysis of AFT1 mRNA levels by S1 ribonuclease protection assays demonstrated that AFT1 transcripts were unaffected by heme depletion (Fig. 4A). Further, Western analysis of cells transformed with a plasmid containing an epitope-tagged Aft1p showed that in the heme-depleted cells there was no significant difference in concentration of Aft1p when compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 4B). We note that there was increased expression of Aft1p in low iron cells, which was not affected by the absence of heme. It is possible that in the absence of heme, iron can accumulate in cells and inhibit transcription of AFT1-regulated genes. This was suggested by Hassett et al. (19Hassett R.F. Romeo A.M. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7628-7636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) to explain the lack of FET3 transcription during anaerobiosis. To test this possibility, we took advantage of the dominant allele AFT1–1up , which is iron insensitive and constitutively activates transcription of the iron regulon (17Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In AFT1–1up cells, there was minimal expression of the FET3-LacZ reporter construct in the absence of heme (Fig. 4C). This result suggests that inhibition of transcription in heme-depleted cells cannot be ascribed to accumulation of cytosolic iron. The iron-sensing transcription factor Aft1p is cytosolic in the presence of iron (11Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Ueta R. Fukunaka A. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18914-18918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the absence of iron, Aft1p is translocated into the nucleus where it activates transcription of the iron regulon. It may be possible that Aft1p is synthesized but cannot translocate into the nucleus in the absence of heme. To test that possibility, we employed an AFT1-GFP fusion construct carried on a high copy plasmid. Genetic experiments confirmed that this construct could complement Δaft1 cells, permitting their growth on low iron media (data not shown). When Δhem1 cells carrying the AFT1-GFP construct were incubated in high ALA in the presence of iron, fluorescence was cytosolic (Fig. 5A), whereas when cells were incubated in iron-depleted media, fluorescence was localized to the nucleus (Fig. 5B). This result confirms previous studies that utilized an HA-tagged Aft1p (17Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). When Δhem1 cells were depleted of heme by growth in TEM media and grown in either iron-replete (Fig. 5C) or iron-limiting conditions (Fig. 5D), the cellular distribution of Aft1p-GFP was similar to that seen in either wild-type cells or in Δhem1 cells grown in high ALA. Taken together, the data in Figs. 4 and 5 suggest that the lack of transcription of the iron regulon is not the result of either the absence of Aft1p or its inability to localize to the nucleus. Translocation of Aft1p from cytosol to nucleus may be independent of DNA binding and transactivation, i.e. nuclear localized Aft1p may not necessarily bind to DNA and induce transcription. To determine whether the Aft1p binding region of the FET3 promoter is occupied by Aft1p in the absence of heme and iron, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. There was minimal FET3 promoter occupancy when Δhem1 cells were grown in high ALA in the presence of high iron. Upon iron depletion, however, Aft1p occupies the FET3 promoter (Fig. 6), resulting in transcriptional activation (Fig. 2A). When Δhem1 cells were depleted of heme by incubation in TEM media, the FET3 promoter occupancy of Aft1p was identical to that seen in Δhem1 cells grown in high ALA (Fig. 6). The ability of Aft1p to occupy the FET3 promoter in the absence of iron and heme implies that either a co-activator is absent or that a specific repressor is present. To ensure that the PCR analysis was performed within the quantitative range, several input chromatin dilutions were made and used for amplification reactions (10Aparicio O. Geisberg J.V. Struhl K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.M. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 61. John Wiley and Sons, New York2003: 21.23.21Google Scholar). Results showed that the amount of PCR product was linear with respect to the input chromatin dilution, and that the amount of immunoprecipitated chromatin PCR product was within this linear range (data not shown). Iron Does Not Accumulate in the Mitochondria of Δhem1 Cells—The low rate of iron accumulation in Δhem1 cells grown under heme-depleted conditions (Fig. 1C) can be explained by the inhibition of FET3/FTR1 transcription. We and others (4Lill R. Diekert K. Kaut A. Lange H. Pelzer W. Prohl C. Kispal G. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) reported that mutations in genes that affect Fe-S cluster formation result in excessive mitochondrial iron accumulation. Reduction of cytosolic iron prevents excessive mitochondrial iron accumulation (8Chen O.S. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7626-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Radisky D.C. Babcock M.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4497-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). A conclusion from those studies is that iron cannot accumulate in mitochondria when cytosolic iron is low. We devised a test to determine if iron could accumulate in Δhem1 mitochondria when cytosolic iron was high. A Δhem1 strain was constructed that constitutively expresses the high-affinity iron transport system. This was accomplished by integrating a construct that had FET3 and FTR1 under the control of the constitutively active PGK promoter (21Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 212: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Under both wild-type (high ALA media) and heme-depleted conditions (TEM media), uptake of 59Fe was high. Ascorbate was added as a reducing agent to bypass the requirement for the heme-dependent ferrireductase. Compared with Δhem1 cells grown in ALA and 80 μm BPS, iron uptake in the Δhem1-FET3/FTR1 strain grown in TEM and 80 μm BPS was increased 2.5-fold (Fig. 7A). This result indicates that heme depletion does not affect the activity of Fet3p/Ftr1p when the genes are transcribed from iron-independent promoters. When the Δhem1-FET3/FTR1 strain was grown in TEM media in the presence of 50 μm FeSO4, the 59Fe uptake was approximately equal to Δhem1 cells grown in ALA and 80 μm BPS. We note in Fig. 7A that there was a difference in iron uptake when the Δhem1-FET3/FTR1 strain was cultured in iron-replete or iron-limiting conditions. Elsewhere, we demonstrate that this difference is due to iron-induced post-translational degradation of cell surface Fet3p/Ftr1p. 2J. Kaplan, unpublished data. The difference in iron uptake of the Δhem1-FET3/FTR1 strain when grown in ALA compared with TEM is likely a consequence of the anaerobic response, although the exact mechanism is unknown. To investigate the subcellular distribution of 59Fe in Δhem1-FET3/FTR1 cells, cultures were incubated with 59Fe for 10 min followed by 2 h of incubation in 59Fe-free media. Cells were disrupted, and the homogenate was separated into a cytosol and membrane fraction. In Δhem1-FET3/FTR1 cells grown in TEM, most 59Fe was present in the cytosol, with only a small fraction associated with membranes (Fig. 7B). The membrane fraction was resuspended and applied to an Iodixanol gradient to separate organelles based upon density. The membrane-associated 59Fe in the Δhem-FET3/FTR1 strain was not concentrated in any particular fraction (Fig. 7C). This result indicates that even when cytosolic iron level is high heme-depleted mitochondria do not accumulate excessive amounts of iron. As shown previously, in the absence of Yfh1p, most accumulated 59Fe was membrane-associated, and when analyzed by Iodixanol gradients, was found to be associated with mitochondria (7Chen O.S. Hemenway S. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 12321-12326Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 20Radisky D.C. Babcock M.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4497-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To determine if the absence of heme prevents mitochondrial iron accumulation, cells were constructed that were Δhem1-FET3/FTR1 and which contained a regulated YFH1 (Δyfh1, pMET3YFH1). The total amount of cellular iron present in these cells was similar in both the presence and absence of Yfh1p (data not shown). However, in the absence of Yfh1p there was a greater amount of iron present in the membrane-associated fraction (Fig. 7B). When analyzed by Iodixanol gradient, much of the increased iron was found associated with mitochondria (Fig. 7C) (7Chen O.S. Hemenway S. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 12321-12326Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 20Radisky D.C. Babcock M.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4497-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The reason the percentage of radioactivity in membranes appears less in the Δhem1/Δyfh1 cells than in Δyfh1 cells is due to the significantly increased total cellular iron accumulation resulting from the expression of the constitutive FET3-FTR1. When the data is normalized to membrane-associated radioactivity, the percentage in mitochondria is similar. These results indicate that in the absence of heme, yeast still have a functional mitochondrial iron import mechanism. Yeast are facultative anaerobes, capable of modifying their metabolism as a function of oxygen tension. Yeast utilize both respiratory and fermentative carbon catabolism when oxygen is replete. Yeast satisfy their energy requirements entirely by glycolysis under anaerobic conditions. Heme, which is used in a variety of oxygen-dependent reactions, is dispensable under anaerobiosis. Under anaerobic conditions, heme synthesis is decreased and cells remodel their metabolism to dispense with the need for heme-based enzymes. A major difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is that much of eukaryotic iron-based metabolism, like heme-based metabolism, is oxygen-dependent. Many of the same oxygen-based metabolic pathways that require heme also require inorganic iron. Examples of such pathways include respiration, sterol synthesis, and lipid metabolism. In response to the lowered respiratory activity, the synthesis of many iron-containing enzymes is dramatically decreased. Similar arguments pertain to enzymes that utilize copper, another redox active transition metal. Copper enzymes that either utilize oxygen (cytochrome c, Fet3p/Fet5p) or metabolize oxygen radicals are either ineffective or unnecessary under anaerobic conditions. Decreased expression of copper and iron containing enzymes results in a decreased concentration of these redox active metals. It is not surprising that in the absence of heme there is reduced expression of the transport systems for redox metal acquisition resulting from decreased transcription of both the iron and copper regulons. Decreased expression of FET3 due to anaerobiosis has been seen previously (19Hassett R.F. Romeo A.M. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7628-7636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). That study suggested that decreased FET3 expression resulted from increased cytosolic iron, particularly Fe2+, which would repress FET3 transcription by deactivating the iron-dependent transcription factor Aft1p. Support for this hypothesis was based on reversal of the anaerobic repression of FET3 transcription by a permeable Fe2+chelator, BIP, and by expression of the iron-independent AFT1-1up allele. However, the anaerobic induction of FET3/FTR1 by Aft1-1up only leads to a fraction of the level of FET3 mRNA seen aerobically. In the absence of heme, as shown in this study, there is a dramatic reduction in both iron transport activity and FET3 mRNA; only 10–15% of message activity is recovered by the AFT1-1up allele. It is important to note that there is a methodological difference between Hasset et al. (19Hassett R.F. Romeo A.M. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7628-7636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and the study presented here. The former study incubated cells under anaerobic conditions using an argon/nitrogen blanket, while we examined the effects of heme depletion using a Δhem1 strain grown in ambient oxygen. The absence of heme is commonly considered to be an indicator of anaerobiosis. In addition to its role as an oxygen carrier in metabolic reactions, heme also plays a role in signaling. Many of the transcriptional changes required for metabolic remodeling are based on heme-dependent transcription factors. Most notable are Hap1p and Hap2/3/4/5p, well-described transcription factors that either activate or repress genes required for aerobic or anaerobic growth. In the absence of heme, many of the physiological changes seen are similar to those seen in anaerobiosis although the absence of heme may not be identical to anaerobiosis. We have explored the mechanism by which the absence of heme prevents transcription of the iron regulon. The decrease in transcriptional activity does not result from decreased expression of AFT1. In the absence of heme, Aft1p acts in an iron-responsive manner, not only in its ability to translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus in response to iron, but also to occupy the FET3 promoter site as defined by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. We conclude that in the absence of heme the behavior of Aft1p is unaffected. Our studies also determined that Hap1p and Hap2/3/4/5p do not affect heme-based transcriptional inhibition of the iron regulon. Deletion of HAP1 or HAP2 did not prevent induction of the iron regulon, nor did deletion of these genes reverse the inhibition of transcription resulting from the absence of heme (data not shown). We also found that deletion of transcriptional repressors ROX1 or MOT3 did not alter the heme-dependent repression of the iron regulon (data not shown). These latter results are supported by published microarray studies that demonstrate that while anaerobiosis had large effects on FET3 and other members of the iron regulon (22Linde J.J. Liang H. Davis R.W. van Steensma H.Y. Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7409-7413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), deletion of HAP1, ROX1, or overexpression of HAP4, had little effect on the iron regulon (22Linde J.J. Liang H.

Beyond a 2-fold change in the ability to induce FET3 reporter constructs when exposed to low iron media, heme depletion still prevented transcription of FET3 in Δrox1 cells. We conclude that there are undescribed genes that affect the transcription of the iron regulon in the absence of iron. Recent studies of oxygen-based transcription and oxygen response elements have suggested that the effects of anaerobiosis cannot be accounted for by the known transcriptional activators or repressors (27Becerra M.

In yeast, defects in mitochondrial Fe-S cluster synthesis result in excessive mitochondrial iron accumulation due to an inhibition of mitochondrial iron export. Studies using mammalian cells also suggest that defects in Fe-S cluster synthesis leads to mitochondrial iron accumulation. This conclusion is based on the observation of increased mitochondrial iron in humans and mice with defects in either frataxin (29Puccio H. Simon D. Cossee M. Criqui-Filipe P. Tiziano F. Melki J.

Heme deficiency in mammals leads to excessive mitochondrial iron accumulation in erythroid precursors but not in other tissues (35Ponka P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of heme does not, however, lead to mitochondrial iron accumulation in yeast. We initially explained this result as a consequence of the decreased transcription of the iron regulon. Deficient Fe-S cluster synthesis only results in mitochondrial iron accumulation when cytosolic iron levels are high (20Radisky D.C. Babcock M.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4497-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 36Foury F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Decreased cytosolic iron, resulting from either media iron deprivation, deletion of iron transporters or increased vacuolar iron storage, prevents excessive mitochondrial iron accumulation. Since decreased heme synthesis prevents transcription of the high-affinity iron transport system, cellular iron levels are low and may preclude mitochondrial iron accumulation. To test this possibility we expressed FET3/FTR1 independent of the iron regulon using a constitutive promoter. In the absence of heme, cells expressing Fet3p/Ftr1p accumulate high levels of iron when given reduced iron. The fact that these proteins are expressed and functional indicates that the effect of heme is directed at transcription of the transport system. Even when heme-deficient cells are iron-replete there is no excessive iron accumulation in mitochondria. Heme deficiency, however, does not prevent iron-replete Δyfh1 cells from accumulating iron within mitochondria.

The 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA)- or amiloride-sensitive fraction of 22Na+ efflux was dramatically accelerated by cytosolic acidification as opposed to thermodynamic prediction, supporting the concept that these NHE isoforms are activated by protonation of an internal binding site(s) distinct from the H+ transport site. Intracellular pH (pHi) dependence of 22 Na+ efflux roughly exhibited a bell-shaped profile; mild acidification from pHi 7.5 to 7 dramatically accelerated 22Na+ efflux, whereas acidification from pHi 6.6 gradually decreased it. Alkalinization above pHi 7.5 completely suppressed EIPA-sensitive 22Na+ efflux. Cell ATP depletion and mutation of NHE1 at Arg440 (R440D) caused a large acidic shift of the pHi profile for 22Na+ efflux, whereas mutation at Gly455 (G455Q) caused a significant alkaline shift. Because these mutations and ATP depletion cause correspondingly similar effects on the forward mode of Na+/H+ exchange, it is most likely that they alter exchange activity by modulating affinity of the internal modifier site for protons. The data provide substantial evidence that a proton modifier site(s) distinct from the transport site controls activities of at least three NHE isoforms through cooperative interaction with multiple protons.

NHEs are involved in various cellular functions such as pH homeostasis, cell volume regulation, and transepithelial Na+ absorption (1Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouysségur J. Physiol.

The activities of NHEs are controlled by various extrinsic factors including hormones, growth factors, pharmacological agents, and mechanical stimuli (1Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouysségur J.

Physiologically, NHE catalyzes an electroneutral exchange of extracellular Na+ for intracellular H+, i.e. a forward mode of exchange with the aid of a constant driving force provided by a Na+ pump. However, NHE is also able to catalyze the exchange of intracellular Na+ for extracellular H+, i.e. a reverse mode of exchange under certain conditions. In cells, NHE is inactivated usually at an intracellular pH (pHi) of ∼7.2, a value much lower than that (>8) predicted from the thermodynamic equilibrium between intracellular and extracellular Na+ and H+ ions. This “set point” behavior has been attributed to the existence of an allosteric regulatory site(s) called the “H+ modifier” site or “pH sensor” in NHE. Twenty years ago, Aronson et al. (9Aronson P.S. Nee J. Suhm M.A. Nature. 1982; 299: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 10Aronson P.S. Ann. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 545-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) elegantly presented evidence for such a site based on analysis of the kinetics of ion exchange in renal brush border membrane vesicles; they found that 22Na+ uptake into Na+-loaded vesicles (Na+/Na+ exchange) is stimulated by intravesicular H+ and that 22Na+ efflux is stimulated by intravesicular H+, a finding opposite to the expected competitive interaction of H+ with Na+. These findings led to the idea that NHE becomes active only when the internal H+ modifier site is occupied by a proton. In many subsequent studies using native or NHE-transfected cells, exchange activity was reported to exhibit a complex, cooperative dependence on the internal H+ concentration despite its hyperbolic dependence on external Na+ or H+ concentration (11Vigne P.

Chem. 1993; 268: 16369-16377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of at least two binding sites for internal H+. However, because only the forward mode of exchange was measured in these studies and because very accurate measurement of pHi is sometimes difficult, it still remains difficult to clearly distinguish the H+ modifier and H+ transport sites. Furthermore, it is not clear that the H+ modifier site exists in various NHE isoforms, because detailed analysis has not yet been performed using cells expressing each NHE isoform. To obtain insight into the modifier role of intracellular H+,in this study we measured pHi dependence of 22Na+ efflux from cells expressing NHE1, NHE2, or NHE3. We found that 22Na+ efflux is dramatically stimulated by intracellular acidification but almost completely inhibited by modest alkalinization (pHi ∼7.5), which provides a strong piece of evidence for the existence of an intracellular H+ modifier site in these NHE isoforms. We show that pHi dependence of the Na+/H+ exchange can be explained by assuming the interaction of multiple protons with the regulatory site(s) and the interaction of a single proton with the transport site.

Measurement of 22Na + Efflux—Serum-depleted cells in 24-well dishes were loaded with 22Na+ by preincubating them for 30 min at 37 °C in chloride/KCl medium comprising 20 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.4), 0.2–1.2 mm22NaCl (37 kBq/ml), 1.9–140 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 5 μm nigericin. Choline chloride was added to the medium to maintain the total concentration of KCl plus choline chloride at 140 mm. After removal of the radioactive preincubation solution, 22Na+ efflux was started by adding the same choline chloride/KCl medium except that it additionally contained 2 mm ouabain and 100 μm bumetanide but not 22Na+. For the data at zero time, this efflux solution was not added. In some wells, the efflux solution contained 0.1 mm EIPA or 5 mm amiloride. At the times indicated in Figs. 1, 3, and 5, cells were rapidly washed four times with ice-cold PBS to terminate 22Na+ efflux. pHi was calculated from the imposed [K+] gradient by assuming the equilibrium [K+]i /[K+]o and an intracellular [K+] of 120 mm.

To measure 22Na+ efflux, we first preincubated PS120 cells or their NHE transfectants for 30 min in a radioactive solution containing 1 mm22NaCl, the K+/H+ ionophore nigericin, and either 48 or 140 mm KCl. This preincubation allowed cells to be pHi-clamped at 7 or 7.5 and, at the same time, to be loaded with 22Na+. 22Na+ was rapidly taken up by cells and reached nearly to the plateau after the preincubation for 20 min under both conditions (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the radioactivity of 22Na+ was equilibrated in the extra- and intracellular medium. The intracellular 22Na+ concentration at 30 min was 1–2 mm by assuming a value of 5 μl of cell water per milligram of protein. After removal of the preincubation solution, cells were placed in a Na+-free, non-radioactive solution (pH 7.4) to start 22Na+ efflux. By this procedure, we were able to measure 22Na+ efflux in the presence of an outwardly directed H+ gradient (at pHi 7) or in almost the absence of the H+ gradient (at pHi 7.5) (Fig. 1A). We expected that NHE-independent background 22Na+ leakage would be minimal, because the efflux medium contained the Na+-pump inhibitor ouabain and the Na+/K+/Cl– cotransporter inhibitor bumetanide but not HCO3-, a substrate for both Na+/HCO3- cotransporter and Na+-dependent Cl-/HCO3- exchanger. In fact, we observed only slow 22Na+ efflux in exchanger-deficient PS120 cells and their NHE1 transfectants in the presence of the NHE-specific inhibitor EIPA (Fig. 1, C–E). As expected, EIPA-sensitive 22Na+ efflux was not detectable in exchanger-deficient PS120 cells whose pHi was maintained at 7 (Fig. 1C) or 7.5 (not shown). In NHE1 transfectants, however, rapid EIPA-sensitive 22Na+ efflux was observed at pHi 7 (Fig. 1D), although little EIPA-sensitive 22Na+ efflux was observed at pHi 7.5 (Fig. 1E). Thus, 22Na+ efflux via NHE1 is dramatically stimulated by intracellular acidification, whereas it is completely inhibited by alkalinization. If we assume that NHE1 catalyzes a counter transport reaction only involving the transport site, the outwardly directed H+ gradient should lead to inhibition of 22Na+ efflux. The data support the view that activity of NHE1 is regulated by protonation/deprotonation of the H+ modifier site(s), which is different from the H+ transport site. To examine pHi dependence of 22Na+ efflux, we clamped pHi at various values by incubating NHE1-expressing cells for 30 min in solutions containing nigericin and different concentrations of KCl. Because 22Na+ was taken up by cells via the exchanger during pHi clamping, 22Na+ loading was greater in cells clamped at lower pHi than in cells clamped at higher pHi. To minimize such differences in 22Na+ loading, we used a pHi clamp solution containing different concentrations (0.2–1.2 mm) of 22NaCl. As shown in Fig. 2A, the level of 22Na+ loading varied from 10 to 16 nmol/mg (corresponding to intracellular concentrations of 2–3 mm), indicating that the outwardly directed Na+ gradient produced under the conditions used was not very different. Fig. 2A also shows levels of 22Na+ remaining in cells 3 min after the addition of the efflux solution with or without EIPA. We plotted the EIPA-sensitive fraction of 22Na+ efflux (Fig. 2B, open circles), and the values normalized to the initial level of 22Na+ loading as a function of pHi (Fig. 2C). The 22Na+ efflux increased steeply with decreasing pHi from 7.5 to 7.2, reached the maximum at pHi 6.6, and then decreased with decreasing pHi from 6.6 to 5.6. The bell-shaped pHi profile of 22Na+ efflux suggests that there are at least two intracellular proton-binding sites, each involved in the stimulation and inhibition of NHE1 function, respectively. We examined the effect of cell ATP depletion on the pHi dependence of 22Na+ efflux. We treated cells for 30 min with metabolic inhibitors 2-deoxyglucose (5 mm) and oligomycin (2 μg/ml) during pHi clamping. Such treatment decreased cell ATP to less than 5% of that in normal cells (16Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In these cells, the initial 22Na+ loading was 6–9 nmol/mg (corresponding to intracellular concentrations of 1.2–1.8 mm) at pHi values from 6.6 to 7.5, although 22Na+ was loaded to high levels (20–30 nmol/mg) at pHi 6.2 or 5.6. EIPA-sensitive 22Na+ efflux and its normalized values were plotted against pHi. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, 22Na+ efflux was almost completely inhibited by ATP depletion at least in the pHi range from 6.6 to 7.5, consistent with the previous finding (16Wakabayashi S.

It is also noted that, similar to the forward mode, the inhibitory effect of ATP-depletion on 22Na+ efflux is alleviated by acidification. Fig. 3 shows the results of similar 22Na+ efflux measurements using cells expressing G455Q or R440D in which the pHi dependence of the forward mode of exchange markedly shifts to alkaline and acidic sides, respectively (Fig. 4B; see also Ref. 20Wakabayashi S.

As in the case with the wild type NHE1, 22Na+ efflux in G455Q-expressing cells was much faster at pHi 7 than at pHi 7.5 (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, a significant level of EIPA-sensitive 22Na+ efflux was still observed in these cells even at pHi 7.5 (Fig. 3B), unlike the case with the wild-type NHE1. In contrast, a significant level of EIPA-sensitive 22Na+ efflux was not observed in R440D-expressing cells at pHi 7 (Fig. 3C) or 7.5 (Fig. 3D), although low levels of 22Na+ efflux were observed in a more acidic range of pHi (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4 shows pHi profiles of 22Na+ efflux in cells expressing G455Q or R440D. The pHi profile was significantly shifted to an alkaline side in G455Q-expressing cells compared with cells expressing the wild-type NHE1 (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, the pHi profile was markedly shifted to an acidic side in cells expressing R440D. Finally, we examined whether intracellular acidification activates 22Na+ efflux in cells expressing NHE2 or NHE3 (Fig. 5). In these experiments, we used a high concentration (5 mm) of amiloride in place of EIPA as an inhibitor, because these isoforms are relatively less sensitive to the amiloride analogue. As in the case of NHE1, modest intracellular acidification (pHi 7) significantly accelerated amiloride-sensitive 22Na+ efflux from cells expressing NHE2 or NHE3, although 22Na+ efflux from NHE2 transfectants was relatively slow (Fig. 5). The slow efflux in NHE2 transfectants may be due to lower expression of the exchanger in the plasma membrane, because exchange activity of these transfectants was 20–30% of that of NHE1 or NHE3 transfectants. In this work we tried to kinetically dissect proton-binding sites in the Na+/H+ exchanger by measuring EIPA-sensitive 22Na+ efflux from cells expressing different NHE isoforms. We loaded cells with 22Na+ while clamping pHi at various values using a K+/nigericin technique and measured 22Na+ efflux at a constant extracellular pH (7.4) in the nominal absence of extracellular Na+. To avoid possible interaction of cytosolic Na+ with the H+ modifier site as suggested previously (14Green J. Yamaguchi D.T. Kleeman C.R. Muallem S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 239-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 25Green J. Yamaguchi D.T. Kleeman C.R. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5012-5015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we limited the extent of 22Na+ loading to low levels (2–3 mm). To our knowledge, 22Na+ efflux has never been measured using cultured cells under such defined conditions. 22Na+ efflux from cells expressing NHE1, NHE2, or NHE3 was markedly stimulated by cytoplasmic acidification, contrary to the prediction based on reduced H+ concentration gradient. As proposed previously (9Aronson P.S. Nee J. Suhm M.A. Nature. 1982; 299: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 10Aronson P.S. Ann. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 545-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the results can be interpreted as indicating that these NHE isoforms possess the H+ modifier site and that occupancy of the latter by a proton(s) results in activation of exchange activity. We observed that the NHE1-mediated 22Na+ efflux exhibited roughly bell-shaped pHi dependence. Modest cytosolic alkalinization (pHi 7.5) abolished 22Na+ efflux (Figs. 1D, 2B, and 4), whereas modest cytosolic acidification from pHi 7.5 to 7–7.2 dramatically enhanced it (Figs. 1C, 2B, and 4). The increase in 22Na+ efflux in the latter pHi range was very steep, suggesting the binding of two or more protons to the modifier site. In a near-neutral pHi range, cell ATP depletion or mutations of NHE1 (R440D and G455Q) caused marked shifts in the pHi dependence of 22Na+ efflux (Figs. 2B, 3B, and 4). Because they also caused similar large shifts in pHi dependence of the forward mode of Na+/H+ exchange under corresponding conditions (20Wakabayashi S. Hisamitsu T. Pang T. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11828-11835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), it is most likely that modulation of Na+/H+ exchange by these procedures is attributable to altered interaction of the H+ modifier site with activating protons. On the other hand, acidosis (<pHi 6.2) caused an extensive inhibition of 22Na+ efflux (Figs. 2B and 4). This inhibition appears to result from competition between Na+ and H+ for the intracellular transport site. Our measurement of the descending and ascending slopes of pHi dependence of 22Na+ efflux thus allowed us to observe the binding of protons to the H+ modifier and H+ transport sites, respectively. The effect of pHi on 22Na+ efflux from cells was measured previously using thymic lymphocytes (13Grinstein S. Goetz J.D. Rothstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1984; 84: 585-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) in which a significant difference in 22Na+ efflux was not observed at the two pHi values tested (7.2 and 6.3). A possible explanation for such data is that the two pHi values used for thymic lymphocytes may not be optimal for observing a large pHi-dependent change in 22Na+ efflux. We attempted to reproduce by simulation the pHi dependence of the forward and reverse modes of Na+/H+ exchange and their modulation by ATP depletion or the exchanger mutations using a simplified reaction model and the assumption that three protons (n = 3) cooperatively interact with the modifier site and a single proton interacts with the transport site (Fig. 6, A and B). We were able to at least qualitatively reproduce complex pHi profiles of the forward and reverse modes of exchange and their modulation (Fig. 6, C and D). For example, ATP depletion or mutation of Arg440 inhibited the uptake and efflux activities more strongly in the neutral pHi range (6.6–7.5). In addition, pHi dependence between 6.6 and 5.6 was very steep when the activity was measured as uptake but not as efflux (Figs. 2 and 4) under ATP depletion or in cells expressing R440D (compare the pHi profiles in Figs. 2, 4 and 6). Thus our measurement of pHi dependence of 22Na+ efflux permitted us to analyze kinetic properties of the H+ modifier site interacting with activating protons. The observed properties are compatible with the predicted roles of the exchanger in cell pHi regulation, i.e. protection of cells from excessive alkalosis, acceleration of recovery of cells from acidosis, and modulation of exchange activity due to alteration in H+ affinity of the modifier site, in particular in the near-neutral pHi range. Mutation of Arg440 shifts pHi dependence of the forward mode of Na+/H+ exchange toward an acidic side, whereas that of Gly455 shifts it toward an alkaline side without changing apparent affinities for extracellular substrates Na+ and H+ and the inhibitor EIPA (20Wakabayashi S. Hisamitsu T. Pang T. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11828-11835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 4B). Thus, the present data reinforce our previous conclusion that the region encompassing the intracellular loop IL5 and the transmembrane domain TM11 plays a crucial role in the proper functioning of the H+ modifier site (20Wakabayashi S. Hisamitsu T. Pang T. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11828-11835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although the structure of the H+ modifier site is not known, we suggested previously that pHi sensing of NHE1 may be controlled by a substructure consisting of intracellular loop IL5 and the juxtamembrane subdomain I of the cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 503–595) with a tightly bound calcineurin B homologous protein (20Wakabayashi S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 17367-17372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In general, a histidine residue has been thought to be a good candidate for a residue involved in pHi sensing, because its imidazole moiety is the only side chain that ionizes in solution within a physiological pH range. Indeed, His225 and His367 have been identified as important residues for pH sensing of the Na+/H+ antiporters of Escherichia coli (NhaA) (27Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Rimon A. Taglicht D. Schuldiner S.

However, little change was observed in pHi sensitivity when histidine residues at positions 76, 81, 250, 285, 325, 373, 376, 407, 408, and 473 were substituted by cysteine in NHE1, 2S.

Biol. 2003; 191: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) reported that mutations at His479 and His499 in the juxtamembrane cytoplasmic domain of rabbit NHE3 shifted the pHi profile to an acidic side. Other histidine residues of NHE1, i.e. His35, His120 and His349 in the membrane-spanning segments (32Wang D. Balkovetz D.F. Warnock D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C392-C402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and those in the histidine cluster (HYGHHH) in the cytoplasmic domain (30Wiebe C.A. Dibattista E.R. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), do not appear to directly influence exchange activity. Although the present results suggest the existence of a H+ modifier site in NHEs, it should be noted that complex kinetic effects of protons on exchanger activation have been reported as follows. (i) Transient kinetic studies of the exchanger using kidney brush border membrane vesicles revealed that the exchanger exhibits cooperativity with respect to the external Na+ concentration when vesicles are acid-loaded (33Otsu K. Kinsella J.L. Heller P. Froehlich J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3184-3193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that protonation of the modifier site may change the oligomeric interaction.

However, the structural basis for these properties of the H+ modifier site is not known. In summary, using cultured cells expressing different NHE isoforms, we obtained evidence for the existence of the H+ modifier site(s) distinguishable from the H+ transport site. Our results suggest that interaction of multiple protons with the modifier site results in a dramatic activation of Na+/H+ exchange in response to modest acidification. Clearly, further work is required to clarify the structure and function of the H+ modifier site, which is a hallmark of NHE regulation."

Immunostaining of epidermis reveals that TIG3 is expressed in the non-proliferating, suprabasal differentiated epidermal layers, but not in the proliferative basal cells (6Duvic M. Helekar B. Schulz C. Cho M. DiSepio D. Hager C. DiMao D. Hazarika P. Jackson B. Breuer-McHam J. Young J. Clayman G. Lippman S.M. Chandraratna R.A. Robinson N.A. Deucher A. Eckert R.L. Nagpal S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 3249-3259PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that TIG3 may play an important regulatory role during keratinocyte differentiation. TIG3 levels are reduced in tumor cells, consistent with the idea that the loss of TIG3 function may contribute to disease progression in cancer (1DiSepio D. Ghosn C. Eckert R.L. Deucher A.

However, the amino acid sequence of TIG3 does not reveal any particular motif that predicts a function, and no information is available regarding the TIG3 mechanism of action. Thus, identifying the mechanism of TIG3 action is an important goal that requires knowledge regarding the effects of TIG3 on cell regulatory mechanisms. In the present study, we show that TIG3 expression in cultured keratinocytes causes a cessation of cell proliferation and enhanced cornified envelope formation. Our results suggest that TIG3 associates with membranes and that the mechanism leading to reduced cell viability involves activation of type I transglutaminase. tazarotene-induced protein 3 transglutaminase type I transglutaminase type II transglutaminase multiplicity of infection benzyloxycarbonyl fluoromethyl ketone 7-aminotrifluoromethylcoumarin transactivator empty vector keratinocyte serum-free medium phosphate-buffered saline fluorescein cadaverine 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide. Adenovirus Infection—The tetracycline-regulated recombinant adenovirus, tAd5-TIG31–164, was constructed by cloning the TIG31–164 coding sequence, linked to an SV40 transcription terminator, into tAd5. This adenoviral vector contains a tetracycline-responsive element that includes the cytomegalovirus promoter and tetracycline operator. Activation of this promoter requires the presence of the tetracycline transactivator (TA) protein that is provided by co-infection with a second adenovirus, Ad5-TA. The ability of the TA protein to activate via the tetracycline operator can be reduced by addition of tetracycline. An empty recombinant adenovirus tAd5-EV was constructed for use as a control. A green fluorescent protein (GFP)-encoding adenovirus, Ad5-GFP, was used to determine keratinocyte infection efficiency. At greater than 10 plaque-forming units/cell, virtually 100% of the cells are infected (not shown). Human foreskin keratinocytes were cultured in keratinocyte serum-free media (KSFM, Invitrogen). Third passage cultures were plated at 15,000–20,000 cells/cm2. After 24 h, the cells were infected with adenovirus for 12 h in KSFM containing 2.5 ng of polybrene/ml. The cells were then washed and incubated in fresh virus-free KSFM for varying times prior to harvest. Cell Viability and Proliferation—Trypan blue exclusion and colorimetric XTT-based assays were used to measure cell viability and proliferation. For dye exclusion, cells, suspended in 200 μl of divalent cation-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), were added to 500 μl of 0.4% (w/v) trypan blue solution (Sigma catalog numberT8154) and maintained for 5 min at 37 °C prior to counting. Alternatively, cell viability and proliferation were measured using an assay based on the cleavage of the tetrazolium salt XTT. In this assay, only viable cells are able to convert the XTT to an orange product. Cells growing in 96-well plates are incubated with the XTT salt for 4–24 h, and the orange cleavage product is detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. Fluorescence Microscopy—Keratinocytes growing on coverslips were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with methanol, and incubated with rabbit anti-TIG3 (1:100) (7Deucher A. Nagpal S. Chandraratna R.A. Di Sepio D. Robinson N.A. Dashti S.R. Eckert R.L. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 17: 1195-1203PubMed Google Scholar) followed by CY3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000, Sigma). After washing, cells were treated with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 to stain nuclei. The cells were washed, placed onto slides, and sealed with N-propyl galate for microscopic visualization by epifluorescence. Immunoblot Methods—Equivalent quantities of protein were electrophoresed on 10% acrylamide gels, and separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblot as described previously (7Deucher A. Nagpal S. Chandraratna R.A. Di Sepio D. Robinson N.A. Dashti S.R. Eckert R.L. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 17: 1195-1203PubMed Google Scholar). The blots were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody. Antibody binding was detected by incubation for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and the antibody complex was visualized using chemiluminescence detection reagents. Flow Cytometry—Keratinocytes were trypsinized, washed twice with cold PBS, and resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/50 μl of PBS containing 0.05% formaldehyde (37 °C for 10 min and 4 °C for 10 min). The cells were permeabilized by addition of 450 μl of methanol and stored at –20 °C. After methanol treatment, cells were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C in 500 μl of PBS containing 50 μg/ml RNase followed by incubation for 30 min in 500 μl of PBS containing 100 μg/ml propidium iodide. The cells were then sorted. Fluorescent Detection of Transglutaminase Substrate Incorporation in Situ—Human keratinocytes, growing on coverslips, were treated with either 20 m.o.i. tAd5-TIG31–164 or 20 m.o.i. tAd5-EV with 5 m.o.i. Ad5-TA in KSFM containing 2.5 μg/ml polybrene for 12 h followed by addition of fresh virus-free medium. At 48 h after infection, fresh KSFM containing 100 μm fluorescein cadaverine (FC) (catalog number A-10466, Molecular Probes) was added for 4 h. The cells were then washed with PBS and fixed with 100% methanol at –20 °C, washed twice with cold methanol, and washed twice more with PBS prior to placing the samples onto slides using N-propyl galate for visualization by fluorescent microscopy using a Nikon Optiphot fluorescence microscope. Cell Fractionation and Transglutaminase Activity Assay—Cells (1 × 50 cm2 dish) were washed with PBS, collected by scraping, and homogenized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to yield the supernatant fraction (cytosol) containing soluble type II transglutaminase. The pellet was homogenized in lysis buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100 followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to yield membrane-associated type I transglutaminase. An equivalent amount of protein from each fraction was added to the reaction tube in a total volume of 125 μl of homogenization buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 4 mm CaCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mg casein, and 0.5 μCi of [3H]putrescine). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, precipitated, washed with trichloroacetic acid, washed with ethanol, and air-dried. [3H]Putrescine incorporation into the pellet was assayed by liquid scintillation counting. Caspase 3 Activity Assay—Human keratinocytes (one 10-cm2 dish/point) were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in 50 μl of caspase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol) (8Sitailo L.A. Tibudan S.S. Denning M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19346-19352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were centrifuged for 3 min at 15,000 × g, and the supernatant was saved for analysis. Supernatant (15 μg of protein in 50 μl of lysis buffer) was added to 50 μl of 2× assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm Ac-DEVD-AFC) and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The caspase 3 substrate, Ac-DEVD-AFC, was obtained from Enzyme Systems. Caspase 3-dependent release of fluorogenic AFC product was monitored at 360-nm excitation and 530-nm emission using a Shimadzu RF-5301 PC spectrofluorophotometer. Values were corrected for background and expressed as pmols of converted substrate/mg of protein/h. UVB Treatment—Near confluent (70%) keratinocytes (one 50-cm2 dish) were exposed to 60 mJ/cm2 of Kodacel-filtered UVB light and harvested at 20 h after treatment. Inhibition of Caspase Activity Using Z-VAD-FMK—Keratinocytes were infected with 5 m.o.i. of Ad5-TA and 20 m.o.i. of either tAd5-EV or tAd5-TIG31–164. At 5 h after infection, fresh KSFM was added containing 50 μm of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. The medium was changed every 24 h with fresh addition of Z-VAD-FMK. At 48 h, cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Parallel dishes were treated with UVB (60 mJ/cm2) in the presence or absence of 50 μm Z-VAD-FMK and then harvested and assayed for viability at 48 h. Antibodies—Rabbit anti-caspase 3 (AHZ0052, 1:2000) was obtained from Biosource International. Goat anti-caspase 8 (sc-8355, 1:2000) and rabbit anti-caspase 9 (sc-8355, 1:2000) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (55494, 1:1000) was obtained from Pharmingen. Mouse anti-human β-actin (A5441, 1:10,000) was obtained from Sigma. Rabbit anti-human involucrin (1:2000), rabbit preimmune serum, and rabbit anti-TIG3 (1:2000) were produced in our laboratory (7Deucher A. Nagpal S. Chandraratna R.A. Di Sepio D. Robinson N.A. Dashti S.R. Eckert R.L. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 17: 1195-1203PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse anti-transglutaminase type 1 was obtained from Biomedical Technologies, Inc. (BT-621, 1:50). Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (A11001, 1:1000) was from Molecular Probes. Cy3-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG (c-2306, 1:1000) was obtained from Sigma. Peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934, 1:8000) and peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (NA931, diluted 1:8000) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. TIG3 Reduces Keratinocyte Cell Number—To study the effects of TIG3 on keratinocyte function, we infected cultured normal human keratinocytes with an empty adenovirus, tAd5-EV, or an adenovirus encoding full-length TIG3, tAd5-TIG31–164. As shown in Fig. 1A, TIG31–164 expression can be detected as early as 12 h after adenovirus infection, and expression is maximal between 24 and 36 h. The appearance of TIG3 is associated with a reduction in keratinocyte cell number beginning at 24 h. At 60 h, the viable cell number is reduced to 10% of the initial density, suggesting that TIG31–164 promotes cell death. To assess the effects of TIG31–164 level on cell viability, cells were infected with tAd5-EV or tAd5-TIG31–164 in the presence of increasing concentrations of tetracycline. TIG3 expression is reduced with increasing tetracycline. As shown in Fig. 1B, reduced keratinocyte cell number is correlated with increased TIG31–164 expression. To characterize cell status, we sorted cells at various times after tAd5-EV or tAd5-TIG31–164 infection. As shown in Fig. 1C, at 24 h after infection, the sub-G1 cell population, i.e. cells with less than a full complement of DNA due to partial apoptotic degradation, is 2.4% in tAd5-EV-infected cells. This number does not increase out to 72 h (not shown). In contrast, TIG31–164 expression increases the sub-G1 cell population from 1.4% at 24 h to 7.2% at 48 h and 21% at 72 h. As a control, we show that UVB treatment of keratinocytes, which promotes apoptosis and accumulation of cells in sub-G1, increases the sub-G1 population to 6.2%. TIG3 Regulates Keratinocyte Cell Morphology—TIG3 expression is also associated with altered cell morphology. The photographs, taken 48 h after infection with empty or TIG3-encoding vector (Fig. 2A), indicate that TIG31–164-expressing cells display a cornified envelope-like morphology and retention of cell nuclei (arrows). To determine whether these structures display cornified envelope-like properties, we assessed their ability to survive boiling in detergent and reducing agent. As shown in Fig. 2B, TIG31–164 expression reduces cell number and markedly increases the percentage of cells, from 3.2 to 33%, that are resistant to boiling in detergent and reducing agent, a characteristic of cornified envelopes. To correlate time of TIG31–164 expression with morphological change, cells were infected with tAd5-TIG31–164 and harvested at various times after infection. As shown in Fig. 2C, limited morphology change is observed at 24, 30, and 40 h after infection, but marked changes are observed at 48 h. Nuclear staining (blue) reveals that TIG3 expression (red) is associated with nuclear shrinkage (arrows). TIG3 Regulates Transglutaminase Activity—Transglutaminases (TGs) are a family of enzymes that assemble differentiation- and cell death-associated structures, including the cornified envelope (9Autuori F.

To determine whether TIG3 influences TG activity, cells were treated with tAd5-EV or tAd5-TIG31–164 for 48 h. During the last 4 h of treatment, the medium was supplemented with 100 μm FC, a cell-permeable fluorescent transglutaminase substrate. Fig. 3A shows that FC incorporation (green) is greatly increased in TIG3-expressing (red) cells. As a second method of detecting TIG3-dependent transglutaminase activity, Fig. 3B shows that total transglutaminase activity, measured by monitoring [3H]putrescene incorporation, is increased 3-fold by TIG31–164. Separation of lysate into soluble and particulate fractions reveals that most of the increase in transglutaminase activity is observed in the particulate (membrane) fraction, suggesting that membrane-associated type I transglutaminase is activated. The increase in type I transglutaminase (TG1) activity could be due to increased expression of TG1. The immunoblot of total extract prepared from tAd5-EV and tAd5-TIG31–164-infected cells (inset) shows that TG1 levels are not visibly altered by TIG3 treatment. Consistent with activating a membrane-associated target, the cell fractionation study shown in Fig. 3C indicates that TIG3 is also associated with the membrane (Part, particulate) fraction. In these studies, cells were infected with TIG3 and then fractionated into cytosol and particulate fractions. As a control, we demonstrate that involucrin, a cytosolic protein, is retained in the soluble fraction. β-actin is present in both the soluble and the particulate fractions. The membrane co-localization of TIG31–164 and TG1 suggests that TIG31–164 may localize in the vicinity of TG1. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 3D, a fraction of the TIG31–164 present in the particulate fraction migrates at the stacking/separating gel interface (asterisk). This type of migration in TG-regulated systems is indicative of covalent cross-link formation to form high molecular weight species (15Robinson N.A. LaCelle P.T. Eckert R.L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 101-107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Robinson N.A. Lapic S. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2721-2728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This suggests that some of the TIG3 serves as a substrate for transglutaminase, suggesting a close juxtaposition. As expected, the high molecular weight material is also present in the total extract lane but is not present in the cytosol (Sol, soluble). The above results suggest that TIG3 and TG1 co-localize. As an additional method of monitoring this localization, cells were infected with TIG31–164 and, after 48 h, the cells were immunostained with anti-TIG3 (red) and anti-TG1 (green). The epifluorescent images (Fig. 3E) show that TIG3 and TG1 accumulate in punctate aggregates. The yellow color in the combined image shows that TIG3 and TG1 co-localize in these structures, further suggesting that the two proteins are in close proximity. TIG3 Regulation of Apoptosis—The above results suggest that TIG3 activates events associated with keratinocyte differentiation. To determine whether TIG3 also regulates apoptotic processes, untreated cells (control) and cells treated for 48 h with empty vector (EV) or TIG31–164-encoding vector were harvested and assayed for caspase 3 activity using the caspase 3-specific substrate, Ac-DEVD-AFC. Uniformly low caspase activity is observed in control, EV- or TIG3-treated cells (Fig. 4A). As a positive control, we show that UVB treatment, a treatment that causes extensive cell apoptosis and caspase activation, markedly increases apoptosis-associated caspase 3 activity. Caspase 3 has been shown to be activated by UVB treatment of keratinocytes (8Sitailo L.A. Tibudan S.S. Denning M.F. J. Biol.

Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). To confirm the caspase assay result, we assayed procaspase 3 protein level by immunoblot. Fig. 4B shows that procaspase 3 is not degraded by TIG31–164, suggesting that it is not activated. However, levels are markedly reduced by UVB treatment, consistent with the known ability to UVB light to promote caspase-associated cell death (8Sitailo L.A. Tibudan S.S. Denning M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19346-19352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 19Takahashi H. Nakamura S. Asano K. Kinouchi M. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Iizuka H. Exp.

The middle panel confirms that TIG3 is expressed in tAd5-TIG31–164 vector-infected cells, and the β-actin blot confirms appropriate protein loading. We next determined whether activity of the initiator caspases (caspase 8 and 9) and PARP are increased by TIG3. These enzymes are also expressed as pro-forms that require cleavage for activation (22Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, expression of TIG31–164 does not enhance cleavage of these enzymes. In contrast, UVB treatment does promote cleavage. We next determined whether the pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, halts the reduction in TIG3-associated cell number. As shown in Fig. 5, TIG31–164 reduces viable cell number to 30%, but the reduction is not reversed by addition of 50 μm Z-VAD-FMK. In contrast, the UVB-associated reduction in viable cell number is substantially reversed by the inhibitor.Fig. 5Inhibition of caspase activity does not prevent TIG3-mediated responses. Cells were infected with 5 m.o.i. of Ad5-TA with 20 m.o.i. of tAd5-EV or tAd5-TIG3 for 12 h. Cells were grown during and after infection in the presence or absence of 50 μm Z-VAD-FMK. Parallel cultures were treated with 50 mJ of UVB in the presence or absence of 50 μm Z-VAD-FMK. After 48 h, the cells were harvested, and viable cell number was assayed by trypan blue exclusion. The means ± S.E. of mean is presented as n = 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) TIG3 Mutant Lacking Carboxyl Hydrophobic Domain Is Inactive—To begin identifying TIG3 functional domains and to show that the cell response is not an artifact of protein overexpression, we tested the ability of TIG31–134, which lacks the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain, to reduce cell viability. The immunoblot shown in Fig. 6A confirms that TIG31–164 and TIG31–134 are expressed at comparable levels. The β-actin blot confirms that protein loading is appropriately normalized. Fig. 6B compares TIG1–164 and TIG31–134 subcellular localization. The left panel confirms that TIG31–164 is preferentially distributed in the particulate fraction and that a fraction of the particulate-localized TIG3 is present in a high molecular weight, presumably cross-linked form. In contrast, unlike TIG31–164, most TIG31–134 immunoreactivity distributes in the cytosol (right panel). We next determined whether TIG31–134 reduces cell viability. Cells were infected with TIG31–164- or TIG31–134-encoding virus. After 48 h, cells were harvested and counted. As shown in Fig. 6C, TIG31–134 does not reduce keratinocyte viability. The microscopy data presented in Fig. 3E indicate that TIG31–164 is preferentially associated with the particulates. We therefore used microscopic methods to monitor TIG31–134 subcellular localization. Cells were infected with TIG31–134 and then stained with anti-TIG3 (red) and anti-TG1 (green). As shown in Fig. 6D, in contrast to TIG31–164, TIG31–134 is diffusely distributed throughout the cell. In addition, the combined image shows only a partial and weak co-localization of TIG31–134 and TG1. TIG31–134 Does Not Activate Type I Transglutaminase—To evaluate whether the TIG3 truncation mutant can regulate biochemical responses, we expressed TIG31–134 in keratinocytes and then determined whether the cells incorporate FC in situ. The immunohistology (anti-TIG3) shown in Fig. 7 indicates that the cells produce TIG31–164 and TIG31–134. The green fluorescence, which indicates the transglutaminase-dependent incorporation of FC substrate, is absent in cells expressing TIG31–134. Thus, TIG31–134 does not cause transglutaminase activation. TIG3 is a member of a recently discovered H-rev family of proteins (1DiSepio D. Ghosn C. Eckert R.L. Deucher A. Robinson N. Duvic M.

https://openalex.org/W2127228589,"Previous studies have established that 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal is a lipid hydroperoxide-derived aldehydic bifunctional electrophile that reacts with DNA and proteins. However, it has now been recognized that 4-oxo-2-nonenal is also a major product of lipid hydroperoxide decomposition. Furthermore, 4-oxo-2-nonenal is more reactive than 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal toward the DNA-bases 2′-deoxyguanosine, 2′-deoxyadenosine, and 2′-deoxycytidine and proteins. The formation of 4-oxo-2-nonenal can be induced through vitamin C-mediated or transition metal ion-mediated homolytic decomposition of polyunsaturated ω-3 lipid hydroperoxides such as 13(S)-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid. We have discovered that synthetic 4-oxo-nonenal or 4-oxo-2-nonenal-generated from 13(S)-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid recognizes the specific amino acid motifs of His75, Ala76, and Lys77 in bovine histone H4. Reaction of the histidine and lysine residues with 4-oxo-2-nonenal results in the formation of a novel cyclic structure within the protein. The cyclic structure incorporates the histidine imidazole ring and a newly formed pyrrole derived from the lysine. The cyclic imidazole-pyrrole derivative that is formed from the small Nα-acetyl-His-Ala-Lys peptide exists as a mixture of two atropisomers that inter-convert upon heating. Such lipid hydroperoxide-derived modifications could potentially modulate transcriptional activation in vivo. Furthermore, the ability to synthesize cyclic peptides using 4-oxo-2-nonenal will facilitate the preparation of novel structural analogs with potential biological activity.

Caldwell S.E. Mills K.A. Lipids. 1995; 30: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Linoleic acid, the major ω-6 PUFA present in plasma lipids, is converted to a complex mixture of 9- and 13-HPODE isomers. There is increasing awareness that oxidative stress can also lead to the production of PUFA lipid hydroperoxides by enzymatic pathways (2Blair I.A. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 1473-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 3Lee S.H. Blair I.A. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2001; 9: 148-155Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). LOXs (4Brash A.R. J.

Biophys. 1998; 349: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) can convert linoleic acid into HPODEs but with much greater stereoselectivity than is observed in free radical reactions. Human 15-LOX produces mainly 13-HPODE (6Kamitani H. Geller M. Eling T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21569-21577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). COX-1 and COX-2 produce mainly 13-HPODE and 9-HPODE by a mechanism similar to that described for dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (7Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5336-5343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HPODEs are subsequently reduced to the corresponding 13(S)- and 9(R)-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids through the peroxidase activity of the COXs (5Hamberg M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 8Schneider C. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4743-4746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The other C-18 PUFAs, linolenic acid (ω-3) and dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (ω-6), which are minor constituents of plasma lipids, are also metabolized by 15-LOX. Linolenic acid is a poor substrate for COX-1 and COX-2 (9Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. Xu N. Huang Z.H. Gage D.A. Watson J.T. Lagarde M. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19330-19336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), but dihomo-γ-linolenic acid has not been studied in detail. C-20 PUFAs all undergo 15-LOX-mediated conversion to hydroperoxides. The major 5-LOX- and COX-derived products from C-20 PUFAs (apart from eicosadienoic acid) are prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes rather than lipid hydroperoxides. PUFA lipid hydroperoxides undergo transition metal ionand vitamin C-dependent (10Lee S.H. Oe T. Blair I.A. Science. 2001; 292: 2083-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) decomposition to the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde genotoxins, 4-oxo-2-nonenal, 4,5-epoxy-2(E)decenal, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (11Lee S.H. Oe T. Blair I.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). 4-Oxo-2-nonenal is a particularly potent lipid hydroperoxide-derived genotoxin (12Lee S.H. Blair I.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), which reacts with DNA-bases such as dGuo to form heptanoneetheno-dGuo adducts (Fig. 1) (13Rindgen D. Nakajima M. Wehrli S. Xu K. Blair I.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 1195-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We speculated that the guanidine moiety present in the amino acid arginine would react with 4-oxo-2-nonenal in a manner analogous to that observed with dGuo (Fig. 1A, box). Indeed, arginine residues have been found to react with 4-oxo-2-noneal (14Doorn J.A. Petersen D.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This finding stimulated an examination of how lipid hydroperoxide-derived 4-oxo-2-nonenal would modify arginine-containing proteins. Histones represent a class of proteins that are extremely arginine rich. Almost 14% of the histone H4 amino acids are arginine residues (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, it is known that alkylation of histone arginine residues results in transcriptional repression (15Bannister A.J. Schneider R. Kouzarides T. Cell. 2002; 109: 801-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Alkylation of arginine by lipid hydroperoxide-derived bifunctional electrophiles could potentially exert a similar epigenetic effect. Thus, up-regulation of COXs, LOXs, or other biochemical pathways involved in free radical generation could be involved in modulation of transcription through pathways that have not been considered previously.

Syntheses of Deuterated 4-Oxo-2-nonenals and [13C 18 ]13-HPODE— Authentic 2-[2H]-, 3-[2H]-, and 2,3-[2H2]-4-oxo-2-nonenals were prepared from 4-hydroxy-2-nonynal diethylacetal. The combination of LiAlH4/LiAl[2H4] and work-up with combinations of NH4Cl/H2O and N[2H4]Cl/[2H2]O allowed regio-selective deuterium incorporation. Oxidation of the products using MnO2 followed by de-protection resulted in formation of the appropriate deuterated 4-oxo-2-nonenal. The site of deuterium incorporation was established by the absence of an NMR signal from the appropriate hydrogen atoms that were present in the protium forms.

MALDI-TOF/MS—Analyses were performed using a Voyager-DE Pro biospectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in the reflector mode. External calibration was made by using three points from the following: matrix dimer (379.0930), des-Arg-bradykinin (904.4681), angiotensin I (1296.6853), Glu 1The abbreviations used are: PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acid; HPODE, hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid; LOX, lipoxygenase; COX, cyclooxygenase; 13-HPODE, 13(S)-hydroperoxy-(Z,E)-9,11-octadecadienoic acid; 9-HPODE, 9(R)-hydroperoxy-(E,Z)-10,12-octadecadienoic acid; MOPS, 3-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; ESI/MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; LC, liquid chromatography; CID, collision-induced dissociation; MRM, multiple reaction monitoring; AcHAK, Nα-acetyl-HAK; MH+, protonated molecular ion; MH2+2 , doubly charged protonated molecular ion; dGuo, 2′-deoxyguanosine; V8E, S. aureus V8 in bicarbonate buffer to cleave at Glu; V8DE, S. aureus V8 in phosphate buffer to cleave at Asp and Glu.-fibrinopeptide B (1570.6774), and neurotensin (1672.9175). Samples were purified with ZipTipC18 cartridges that were washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O (2 × 10 μl) and eluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% aqueous acetonitrile (10 μl). They were pre-mixed (1:1) with a matrix solution consisting of saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinamic acid in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% aqueous acetonitrile and air-dried. LC/ESI/MS—Analyses were performed on an LCQ Classic ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA). ESI was conducted using a needle voltage of 4.5 kV. Nitrogen was used as the sheath (60 psi), and auxiliary (5 units) gas was used with the heated capillary at 180 °C. CID experiments employed helium with a collision energy at 50% (1 V). Chromatography was performed using an Alliance 2690 HPLC system equipped with an autosampler, vacuum degasser, and column heater (Waters Co.). LC separations were performed using a Vydac C18 (100 × 1.0 mm inside diameter; 300 Å, 5 μm) column with a flow rate of 50 μl/min. Solvent A was 0.07% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and solvent B was 0.07% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. A linear gradient was employed as follows: 0 min, 1% B; 60 min, 91% B; 62 min, 100% B; 64 min, 1% B; and 90 min, 1% B. LC/ESI/MRM/MS—Analyses were conducted on a TSQ 7000 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan). ESI was conducted using a needle voltage of 4.5 kV. Nitrogen was used as the sheath (60 psi), and auxiliary (10 units) gas was used with the heated capillary at 220 °C. A collision offset energy of -30 eV and a collision cell pressure of 2.75 mT were used for CID experiments. Chromatography was also conducted using the Waters Alliance system. LC separations were performed using a Hypersil C18 column (100 × 1.0 mm inside diameter; 120 Å, 5 μm) (BD Biosciences) with a flow rate of 50 μl/min. Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water, and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. A linear gradient was employed as follows: 0 min, 1% B; 60 min, 91% B; 62 min, 100% B; 64 min, 1% B; and 90 min, 1% B. NMR— 1H spectra (500 MHz) were determined at 25 °C using a Varian UNITY 500 instrument. Samples were dissolved in 750 μl of [2H4]methanol and introduced into an NMR tube (200 × 5 mm outside diameter). The residual solvent peak (3.35 ppm) was used as the reference signal. Coupling constants were shown as Hz values. Acquisition conditions were as follows: spectral width of 6000 Hz, 30° pulse flip angle, 32,000 data points, and 32 transients. Reaction of Histone H4 and Peptides with 4-Oxo-2-nonenal—Bovine histone H4 (9 nmol, 100 μl in pH 7.0 Chelex-treated 50 mm MOPS buffer) was allowed to react with 4-oxo-2-nonenal (45 nmol, 20 μl of ethanol) at 37 °C for 24 h. The sample was desalted with a protein desalting spin column (gel permeation cartridge, cutoff of 7000 Da) divided into five aliquots. The modified histone H4 was digested separately with trypsin in 0.1 m NH4HCO3, V8E in 0.1 m NH4HCO3, V8DE in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), or 5% CNBr in 70% formic acid. Enzymes were used in the ratio of 1/20 (v/v). For the synthetic peptide experiments, each peptide (0.2 μmol, 200 μl in pH 7.0 Chelex-treated 50 mm MOPS buffer) was allowed to react with 4-oxo-2-nonenal, 2-[2H]-, 3-[2H]-, or 2,3-[2H2]-4-oxo-2-nonenal (0.16 μmol, 20 μl ethanol) at 37 °C for 24 h. Reaction of Histone H4 with 13-HPODE—Bovine histone H4 (18 nmol, 200 μl in pH 7.0 Chelex-treated 50 mm MOPS) was allowed to react with 13-HPODE or [13C18]13-HPODE (500 nmol, 20 μl ethanol) in the presence of vitamin C (10 mm) at 37 °C for 24 h. The samples were desalted with protein desalting spin columns (Pierce) followed by tryptic digestion (1/40, v/v) in 0.1 m NH4HCO3 at 37 °C for 36 h. Synthesis of Nα-Acetyl-HAK (AcHAK)/4-Oxo-2-nonenal Adduct— 4-Oxo-2-nonenal (4.6 mg, 16.3 μmol) in 200 μl of ethanol was added to the solution of AcHAK (8.0 mg, 20.2 μmol) in 2 ml of 50 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7). The mixture was kept at 37 °C for 24 h. The modified peptide was purified on a YMC basic (150 × 4.6 mm inside diameter; 120 Å, 5 μm) column. Solvent A was 0.07% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and solvent B was 0.07% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. A linear gradient was run as follows: 0 min, 25% B; 15 min, 100% B; 17 min, 25% B; 30 min, 25% B. The flow rate was 800 μl/min. The major peak (t R = 6.8 min) was collected, and the fraction was concentrated to 1 ml under nitrogen. The concentrated fraction was desalted by using the same HPLC column and the water/acetonitrile mobile phase without trifluoroacetic acid. The pure adduct was obtained as a white solid (∼2 mg). Chiral Separation of AcHAK/4-Oxo-2-nonenal Isomers—LC was performed using a Daicel Chiralcel OD-RH (tris(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamoyl)cellulose-coated silica gel) column (150 × 4.6 mm inside diameter) with UV detection at 220 nm. Solvents A and B were water and acetonitrile, respectively. A linear gradient was run as follows: 0 min, 10% B; 20 min, 40% B; 22 min, 10% B; 40 min, 10% B. The flow rate was 500 μl/min. The first isomer (t R = 13.5 min; ∼1 mg) and the second isomer (t R = 14.5 min; ∼1 mg) were collected separately, concentrated under a nitrogen stream, and obtained as white solids. LC/ESI/MS Analysis of Intact Bovine Histone H4 —The expected molecular mass of bovine H4 based on the amino acid sequence is 11,236.2. The multiply charged ion envelope was consistent with the presence of three molecular forms. Deconvolution of the signals revealed the presence of three different post-translation modifications, including dimethylation (11,265.01 ± 1.58 Da), acetylation together with dimethylation (11,307.01 ± 1.39 Da), and diacetylation together with dimethylation (11,348.01 ± 1.20 Da). The most abundant molecular form (as judged by its molecular ion envelope intensity) was acetyl-dimethyl-histone H4. LC/ESI/MS Analysis of Bovine Histone H4 Digests—It was possible to obtain 89% coverage of the bovine histone H4 protein (Table I). Structural assignments were all confirmed by CID analysis and comparison of spectra with ProteinProspector version 4.0.5 (MS-digest). LC/MS analysis of selected peptide fragments obtained on trypsin digestion is shown in Fig. 2A. LC/MS analysis of selected V8 peptide fragments is shown in Fig. 3B. These experiments identified the site of dimethyllysine modification as Lys20 and acetylation as Lys16. The other (minor) site of acetylation was tentatively assigned as Lys5 or Lys8, because peptides containing these amino acid residues were not detected either by LC/MS or MALDI-TOF/MS analysis.Table ILC/MS/MS characterization of peptide fragments from bovine histone H4 after digestion with proteases and CNBrPeptideDigestCharge nMH+n calcdaCalculatedMH+n foundObserved b and y ionsG9LGK12Tryptic1374.2403374.21y3, b3, y2, b2, y1G13GAK(Ac)R17Tryptic2244.6512265.88y4+Ac, y3+Ac, b4+Ac, y2+Ac, b3, y1, b2H18R19Tryptic1312.1784312.18y1K(Mc2)20VLR23Tryptic1515.3669543.51y3, b3+Me2, y2, b2+Me2, y1, b1+Me2D24NIQGITKPAIR35Tryptic2663.3810663.89y9, y8, y7, y6, y5, b5, y4, b3, b2R36LAR39Tryptic1515.3418515.40y3, b3, b2, y2L37AR39Tryptic1359.2407359.22y2, b2, y1R45ISGLIYEETR55Tryptic2668.8652669.10y10, y9, b10, y8, b8, b7, y5, b6, y3, y2I46SGLIYEETR55Tryptic2590.8146591.11y9, y8, y6, b7, y5, b6, y4, b5, b4, b3, b2T54RGVLKVFLE63V8E2581.3537581.60b9, b8, b7, b6, b5, b4, b3, y2, b2V60FLENVIR67Tryptic1989.5784989.62y7, y6, b6, b5, y4N64VIRD68V8DE1616.3418616.46y4, b4, y3, b3, b2N64VIRDAVTYTE74V8E2640.8283641.13b10, y9, b9, y8, b8, y7, b7, b6, y5, b4, y3, y2D68AVTYTEHAK77Tryptic2567.7755567.97b9, y8, b8, y7, y6, b6, y5, b5, b4, b3, b2H75AKRKTVTAMD85V8DE2629.3408629.78y10, y9, b7, y7, y6, b5, b2D85VVYALKRQQRTLYGTGG102CNBr21000.53981000.87y15, b10, b6, b5V86VYALKRQQRTLYGTGG102V8DE2943.0263943.63y10, b8, b6, b5, y5, b4, b3T96LYGTGG102Tryptic1714.3463714.29b6, y7, b5, y5, b4, y4, y3a Calculated Open table in a new tab Fig. 3LC/MS analysis of histone H4 after V8 digestion before (A) and after (B) treatment with 4-oxo-2-nonenal.

However, there was a substantial reduction in the amount of one tryptic peptide (D68AVTYTEHAK77), as shown in Fig. 2B. The V8 (Fig. 3B) and CNBr (data not shown) fragments were essentially identical. Reaction of D68AVTYTEHAKRKT80 with 4-Oxo-2-nonenal— MALDI/MS analysis of the reaction product revealed that the MH+ had increased from 1519.8 Da for the unmodified peptide to 1637.8 Da after reaction with 4-oxo-2-nonenal. This finding corresponded to a mass increase of 118 Da. The modified peptide was isolated and digested with trypsin. This resulted in the formation of peptide fragments with MH+ of 1408.51 Da (modified D68AVTYTEHAKR78) and 1252.42 Da (modified D68AVTYTEHAK77), respectively (Fig. 4A). Reaction of D68AVTYTEHAK77 with 4-Oxo-2-nonenal—Analysis of the modified peptide by MALDI/MS revealed the presence of a modified peptide with an MH+ of 1252.41. This finding was identical with the peptide observed in the digestion of 4-oxo-2-nonenal-modified D68AVTYTEHAKRKT80. Digestion of the modified peptide with V8E resulted in the formation of a peptide with an MH+ of 473.29 Da (Fig. 4B), as determined by MALDI/MS. This result corresponded to a modified form of H75AK77. LC/ESI/MS confirmed the MALDI data by showing the presence of a singly charged ion at m/z 473.1 (MH+). However, CID analysis provided no structurally informative ions. Major ions that were observed were at m/z 456 (MH+-NH3), 445 (MH+-CH=NH), and 428 (MH+-NH3-CH=NH). Reaction of AcHAK with 4-Oxo-2-nonenal—Analysis of the reaction by LC/MS revealed a time-dependent decrease in MH+ at m/z 397. There was a concomitant increase in the formation of a compound with a retention time of 13.9 min and an MH+ at m/z 515. After 24 h, there was one major ion detected in the LC/MS total ion chromatogram (Fig. 5a). There was a substantial reduction in the amount of AcHAK, as evidenced from the intensity of the ion chromatogram for MH+ (m/z 397) (Fig. 5b). An intense ion chromatogram was observed for MH+ of the modified peptide at m/z 515 (Fig. 5c). CID of MH+ of the major product (m/z 515) resulted in the formation of a series of product ions at m/z 487 (MH+-CH=NH), 444 (MH+-C5H11), 428 (MH+-CH3CONH2-CH=NH) (Fig. 6A). This fragmentation pattern provided no structurally significant ions, in contrast to the unmodified AcHAK peptide. CID of MH+ from AcHAK (m/z 397) resulted in the formation of ions at m/z 269 (b2+H2O), 251 (b2), 218 (y2), 180 (b1), 152 (a1), and 147 (y1) (Fig. 6B).Fig. 6LC/MS/MS analyses of AcHAK and AcHAK adduct.

The 1H NMR showed a series of signals in the aromatic region, δ (ppm) 6.01 (1H, d, J = 3.0 Hz; Ha from pyrrole): 6.10 (1H, d, J = 3.0 Hz; Ha from pyrrole); 6.58 (1H, d, J = 3.0 Hz; Hb from pyrrole), 6.62 (1H, d, J = 3.0 Hz; Hb from pyrrole); 6.68 (1H, s; Hc from imidazole), 6.74 (1H, s; Hc from imidazole); and 7.53 (1H, s; Hd from imidazole), 7.54 (1H, s; Hd from imidazole) (Fig. 7). This result suggested that there was a mixture of two isomers present. Chiral chromatography on a Daicel Chiralcel OD-RH was used to separate the two isomers (Fig. 8). NMR for the first eluting isomer (δ ppm) was as follows: 0.86 (3H, t, J = 6.5 Hz; CH3 from C5H11), 1.33 (3H, d, J = 7.0 Hz; CH3 from A), 1.0-1.8 (12H, m; α-, β-, γ-CH2 from lysine and CH2CH2CH2 from C5H11), 1.99 (3H, s; CH3CO), 2.25 (1H, m; CH from C5H11), 2.55 (1H, m; CH from C5H11), 3.00 (1H, q, J1 = 15.0 Hz, J2 = 7.5 Hz; βH-1 from H), 3.10 (1H, d, J = 15.0 Hz; βH-2 from H), 3.91 (1H, d, J = 10.5 Hz; ϵH-1 from K), 3.96 (1H, brs; ϵH-2 from K), 4.20 (1H, brs, αH from K), 4.67 (1H, brs; Hα from H), 6.10 (1H, d, J = 3.0 Hz; Ha from pyrrole), 6.62 (1H, d, J = 3.0 Hz; Hb from pyrrole), 6.74 (1H, s; Hc from imidazole), and 7.53 (1H, s; Hd from imidazole). NMR for the second eluting isomer (δ ppm) was as follows: 0.84 (3H, t, J = 7.0 Hz; CH3 from C5H11), 1.30 (3H, d, J = 7.0 Hz; CH3 from A), 1.0-1.9 (12H, m; α-, β-, γ-CH2 from lysine and CH2CH2CH2 from C5H11), 1.97 (3H, s; CH3CO), 2.54 (1H, m; CH from C5H11), 2.66 (1H, m; CH from C5H11), 2.99 (1H, d, J1 = 15.0 Hz; βH-2 from H), 3.07 (1H, q, J1 = 14.0 Hz, J2 = 8.5; βH-1 from H), 3.94 (1H, d, J = 13.7 Hz; ϵH-1 from K), 4.01 (1H, q, J1 = 13.7 Hz, J2 = 7.0 Hz, ϵH-2 from K), 4.17 (1H, t, J = 6.1 Hz; αH from K), 4.55 (1H, brs; Hα from H), 6.01 (1H, d, J = 3.0 Hz; Ha from pyrrole), 6.58 (1H, d, J = 3.0 Hz; Hb from pyrrole), 6.68 (1H, s; Hc from imidazole), and 7.54 (1H, s; Hd from imidazole).Fig. 8Separation of 4-oxo-2-nonenal-modified AcHAK isomers by chiral phase chromatography using a Daicel Chiralcel OD-RH column.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Purified isomer 1 and purified isomer 2 were heated at 50 °C in water for 150 h. Analysis by chiral chromatography showed that eventually an equilibrium was established in which there was 40% of isomer 1 and 60% of isomer 2 present. LC/MS Analysis of the Reaction of AcHAK with Deuterated 4-Oxo-2-nonenal Analogs—Treatment of AcHAK with 3-[2H]-4-oxo-2-nonenal resulted in the formation of an adduct with identical LC/ESI/MS characteristics to the adduct obtained from reaction of the protium form of 4-oxo-2-nonenal with AcHAK. The molecular ion region revealed ions at m/z 515.3 (MH+ protium form; 100%), 516.3 (24%), 517.3 (4%), and 518.3 (1%) (Fig. 9A). The product from 2-[2H]-4-oxo-2-nonenal was different in the molecular ion region. Ions were observed at m/z 515.3 (MH+ of protium form; 68%), 516.3 (MH+ of deuterium form; 100%), 517.3 (32%), and 518.3 (6%) (Fig. 9B). The molecular ion region obtained from the 2,3-[2H2]-4-oxo-2-nonenal-derived adduct was essentially identical with that obtained from 2-[2H]-4-oxo-2-nonenal. Ions were observed at m/z 515.3 (MH+ protium form; 51%), 516.3 (MH+ deuterium form; 100%), 517.3 (32%), and 518.3 (6%). LC/MS/MS Analysis of 4-Oxo-2-nonenal-modified D68AVTYTEHAKR78—The CID spectrum of MH2+2 at m/z 705 resulted in the generation of product ions at m/z 1234.5 (b10), 1123.7 (y8), 1022.6 (y7), 859.5 (y6), 758.4 (y5), 647.5 (y10+2), 629.4 (y4), 612.1 (y9+2), 562.4 (y8+2), and 511.9 (y7+2) (Fig. 10A). An identical spectrum was obtained from D68AVTYTEHAKR78 isolated from the tryptic digestion of 4-oxo-2-nonenal-modified histone H4 (Fig. 10B). An LC/MRM/MS method was developed using the transition 704.8 (MH2+2) → m/z 1123.6 (y8). Using a Hypersil reversed-phase column with a linear water/acetonitrile gradient, the major adduct eluted at 42.9 min. It was possible to separate two additional isomers with retention times of 44.0 and 46.2 min (Fig. 11A, upper). As expected, there were no signals in the channel corresponding to the 13C9 analog (709.3 → m/z 1132.6) (Fig. 11A, lower).Fig. 11LC/MRM/MS analysis of modified D68AVTYTEHAKR78.

https://openalex.org/W2077828827,"The surface of a pollen grain consists of an outermost coat and an underlying wall. In maize (Zea mays L.), the pollen coat contains two major proteins derived from the adjacent tapetum cells in the anthers. One of the proteins is a 35-kDa endoxylanase (Wu, S. S. H., Suen, D. F., Chang, H. C., and Huang, A. H. C. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 49055–49064). The other protein of 70 kDa was purified to homogeneity and shown to be a β-glucanase. Its gene sequence and the developmental pattern of its mRNA differ from those of the known β-glucanases that hydrolyze the callose wall of the microspore tetrad. Mature pollen placed in a liquid medium released about nine major proteins. These proteins were partially sequenced and identified via GenBank™ data bases, and some had not been previously reported to be in pollen. They appear to have wall-loosening, structural, and enzymatic functions. A novel pollen wall-bound protein of 17 kDa has a unique pattern of cysteine distribution in its sequence (six tandem repeats of CX 3CX 10–15) that could chelate cations and form signal-receiving finger motifs. These pollen-released proteins were synthesized in the pollen interior, and their mRNA increased during pollen maturation and germination. They were localized mainly in the pollen tube wall. The pollen shell was isolated and found to contain no detectable proteins. We suggest that the pollen-coat β-glucanase and xylanase hydrolyze the stigma wall for pollen tube entry and that the pollen secrete proteins to loosen or become new wall constituents of the tube and to break the wall of the transmitting track for tube advance.

The pollen produces a tube that penetrates the stigma and grows through the wall of adjacent cells in the transmitting track in the style to reach the ovary, where the tube delivers the male gametes to fertilize the eggs. Pollen tube penetration of the stigma and advancement in the style are critical steps in sexual reproduction; yet biochemical information on this process is limited. The surface of a pollen grain makes the initial contact with the stigma. It includes an outermost coat and an underlying wall (1Mascarenhas J.P.

The coat consists of lipids and proteins, which are initially synthesized and accumulated in the tapetum cells that enclose the pollen locule in the anthers. Upon lysis of the tapetum cells, the accumulated lipids and proteins are discharged onto the microspores (maturing pollen), forming the bulk of the pollen coat. In some species, the coat also contains minor proteins involved in self-incompatibility, which are synthesized in the pollen interior (4McCormick S. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The underlying wall consists of sporopollenin and other polymers embedded with proteins; it is derived from the tapetum and the pollen interior (3Bewley J.D. Hempel F.D. McCormick S. Zambryski P. Buchanan B.B. Gruissem W. Jones R.L. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Plants. American Society for Plant Biologists, Rockville, MD2000: 988-1043Google Scholar). The pollen coat consists of lipids and proteins, and its composition varies, depending on the species. The coat in insect- or self-pollinating species, of which Brassica and Arabidopsis are the best studied (5Wu S.S.H. Platt K.A. Ratnayake C. Wang T.W. Ting J.T.L. Huang A.H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The lipids are for waterproofing, whereas the amphipathic oleosins may act as a wick for water uptake to initiate germination. The pollen coat in wind-pollinating species is thin (3Bewley J.D.

Only the 35-kDa protein, which is the most abundant, has been characterized and shown to be an active endoxylanase. It is initially synthesized as a large, inactive precursor in the tapetum and then activated after cleavage by a serine protease at both the N and C termini. The precursor or the mature 35-kDa xylanase does not have an apparent signal sequence that could target the protein to specific organelles; the protein is presumed to be present in the cytosol and is released to the anther locule and then the pollen surface after lysis of the tapetum cells. After landing on the stigma, the pollen would release the xylanase to hydrolyze the stigma wall for the entry of the pollen tube into the transmitting track. The characteristics of the other coat proteins of 70 and 25 kDa are presented in the current report. Imbibed pollen quickly releases proteins that were present in the coat or the wall, or are secreted from the pollen interior. These proteins include expansin, extensin, polygalacturonase, trypsin inhibitors, and a few others (2Taylor L.P. Hepler P.K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 461-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 10Cosgrove D.J. Nature. 2000; 407: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar, 11Allen R.L. Lonsdale D.M.

A. 1997; 94: 6559-6564Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Most of them are also categorized as pollen allergens because of their allergenic properties (13Andersson K. Lidholm J. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 2003; 130: 87-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Some of these proteins were shown to have their mRNA present in mature pollen. The relative amounts of these individual proteins in the whole pollen are unknown. It is also unclear whether these proteins are present in the coat or the wall of the mature or germinated pollen and thus whether they will exert their functions on the stigma or inside the style. Another uncertainty is whether these proteins and their mRNA are present continuously in the pollen or pollen tube after germination. Finally, although these proteins have been individually studied in diverse species, their possible collaborative actions in one species has not been examined. All of these uncertainties are addressed in this report. We have used maize as an example of wind-pollinating species to characterize the major pollen proteins present in the coat and released from the wall or interior of mature and germinated pollen. The coat proteins include a xylanase and a β-glucanase derived from the adjacent tapetum cells. The pollen-released proteins represent about 10% of the total pollen proteins. They include many wall-reactive constituents and are synthesized in the pollen interior and secreted to the wall and the exterior. The actions of the coat and pollen-released proteins would allow the advance of the pollen tube on the stigma and through the style, respectively. Several of the proteins in the coat and released from the pollen are novel or have not been previously reported as being present in the pollen. Plant Materials—Maize (Zea mays L., B73) plants were grown in a greenhouse, and fresh pollen and anthers were collected as described (9Wu S.S.H. Suen D.F. Chang H.C. Huang A.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49055-49064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Anthers of five developmental stages were selected on the basis of the following criteria (8Bih F.Y. Wu S.S.H. Ratnayake C. Walling L.L. Nothnagel E.A. Huang A.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22884-22894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar): At stage 1, the tassel was still embedded in the shoot apex. The anthers filled up about one-third of each floret. Each microspore mother cell had undergone meiosis to produce a tetrad of microspores, which were still encased within a callose wall. At stage 2, the upper portion of the tassel had protruded from the shoot apex. The anthers filled up about one-half of the floret. Young microspores had been released from the dissolved callose wall, and the outer pollen wall (exine) had been synthesized. At stage 3, the tassel had protruded completely out of the top of the plant. The anthers filled up about two thirds of the floret. The microspores had become larger and contained multiple small vacuoles. The first mitosis had occurred, and the microspores were binucleate. At stage 4, the anthers filled up the floret completely. Second mitosis in the microspores had occurred, and the microspores were trinucleate. At stage 5, the tassel was yellow. Some of the florets on the tassel were open, and the pollen was ready to be released. Pollen Germination—A sample of 5 mg of freshly collected pollen was placed in 1.5 ml of liquid germination medium containing 100 ppm Ca(NO3)2, 10 ppm H3BO3, 37.5 ppm lysine, 5 ppm cystine, 0.05 ppm glutamic acid, and 15% (w/v) sucrose (14Saini J.P. Dube S.D. Maydica. 1986; 31: 227-232Google Scholar). More than 80% of the pollen germinated, and the length of the pollen tube was about 0.5 and 4 times the diameter of the pollen after 10 and 30 min, respectively. Preparation of an Anther Wall Fraction and a Microspore Fraction— Each anther of developmental stage 3 was placed in a drop of solution containing 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and 0.4 m sucrose on a dish and sliced open longitudinally with a scalpel under a dissecting microscope. The microspores were gently scraped from the anther wall. The microspores and the anther wall, which still retained about 10% of the original microspores, were collected separately. Each of the two fractions from 10 anthers were combined and subjected to RNA extraction. Preparation of a Total Pollen Fraction, a Pollen-released Protein Fraction, an Interior Fraction, and a Pollen Shell Fraction—Fresh pollen was homogenized rigorously in 0.01 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, with a mortar and pestle to yield a total protein fraction. A sample of 20 mg of fresh pollen was placed in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube containing 1 ml of 0.01 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2 or the germination medium described in a preceding paragraph. The preparation was shaken gently for 10, 20, or 60 min and centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 3 min. The supernatant was collected as the pollen-released protein fraction. The pellet was homogenized gently in 0.2 ml of 0.01 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2 with a small mortar and pestle, and the homogenate was referred to as the pollen interior fraction. The homogenate was put onto a sucrose gradient containing, from top to bottom, 0.5 ml each of 1, 1.5, and 1.9 m sucrose in 0.05 m HEPE-NaOH, pH 7.5, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The interface materials between the 1 and 1.5 m sucrose solution were collected. The sample was mixed with three volumes of 0.05 m HEPE-NaOH, pH 7.5, and centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 3 min. The pellet was resuspended with a small volume of 0.05 m HEPE-NaOH, pH 7.5, and was referred to as the pollen shell fraction. Extraction of a Coat Fraction by Diethyl Ether from Pollen and Partition of Its Proteins into an Aqueous Medium for Enzymatic Studies—Freshly collected pollen was mixed with diethyl ether (1 g of pollen/10 ml of ether) for 1 min in a capped tube by repeated inversions. The ether layer was collected after centrifugation for 10 min at 8,000 × g. The ether preparation was reduced to 1 ml under a stream of nitrogen and used as the coat fraction for SDS-PAGE. Also, the proteins in this coat fraction were partitioned into an equal volume of 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2 for fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). 1The abbreviations used are: FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; EST, expressed sequence tag; 4-NPG, p-nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside; RT, reverse transcriptase; UTR, untranslated region; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Cation Exchange FPLC—The procedure was as described earlier (8Bih F.Y. Wu S.S.H. Ratnayake C. Walling L.L. Nothnagel E.A. Huang A.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22884-22894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All solutions contained 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2. The aqueous pollen coat sample (∼30-μg proteins in 3 ml) described in the preceding paragraph was filtered through a 0.2-μm syringe filter and applied to a pre-equilibrated Mono S HR 5/5 FPLC column (Amersham Biosciences). Solutions of 5 ml of 0 m NaCl, 6 ml of 0.25 m NaCl, 15 ml of a linear gradient of 0.25–0.75 m NaCl, 5 ml of 1 m NaCl, and 5 ml of 2 m NaCl were applied successively to the column. Chromatographic fractions of 0.5 ml each were collected and analyzed for protein constituents by SDS-PAGE and β-glucanase and xylanase activities. The fractions containing the purified 70- and 35-kDa proteins had the peak activities of β-glucanase and xylanase, respectively and were retained for additional analyses of enzyme activities. Enzyme Activity Assay—β-glucanase activity was measured by monitoring the appearance of reducing ends from substrates at time intervals. Laminarin from Laminarin digitata (Sigma) was used as the substrate. The β-glucanase reaction mixture of 0.3 ml contained the purified 70-kDa protein fraction and 0.3 mg laminarin in a 0.05 m buffer, which included sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 5.0, and 5.5; succinate-NaOH, pH 5.5, and 6; phosphate-NaOH, pH 6, 7, 8, and 8.5; CHES-NaOH, pH 8.5, 9, and 10. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of 0.9 ml of p-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide reagent and then heating (15Lever M. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 81: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). After the mixture was cooled, the absorbance of the reaction mixture was read at 410 nm with a spectrophotometer. The enzyme activity was monitored at four time intervals within a 6-h period to ensure linearity of the reaction. The activities of the purified coat β-glucanase fraction, the purified coat xylanase fraction, and Aspergillus niger β-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.4, from Sigma) on various substrates (xylan, lichenan, carboxymethylcellulose, and polygalacturonic acid; Sigma) in 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, were assayed as described for laminarin. Activities of the various enzyme preparations on 0.15 mg of p-nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside (4-NPG; Sigma) were assayed in 0.3 ml of 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.6 ml of 4% (w/v) Na2CO3 (16Biely P. Vrsanska M. Kratky Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 108: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and the absorbance of the reaction mixture was read at 410 nm with a spectrophotometer. SDS-PAGE of Proteins for Separation, Antibody Preparation, and Peptide Microsequencing—Acrylamide (12.5%, w/v) SDS-PAGE was performed as described (5Wu S.S.H. Platt K.A. Ratnayake C. Wang T.W. Ting J.T.L. Huang A.H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12711-12716Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The proteins in the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. For antibody preparation, gel slices containing the 10- and 17-kDa proteins from the pollen-released and interior fractions, respectively, were cut from the gel and used to produce antibodies in chicken (5Wu S.S.H. Platt K.A. Ratnayake C. Wang T.W. Ting J.T.L. Huang A.H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12711-12716Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). For microsequencing, fractionated proteins in a gel were transferred to a polyvinyldene fluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) (9Wu S.S.H. Suen D.F. Chang H.C. Huang A.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49055-49064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and sequenced at their N termini at the Genomic Institute at the University of California, Riverside (Riverside, CA). Alternatively, the proteins in the gel were subjected to trypsin digestion (for the 14-, 25-, and 70-kDa proteins) and their fragments sequenced at the Iowa State University Protein Facility (Ames, IA). The obtained sequences of the 10-, 14-, 17-, 20-, 23-, 25-, 35-, 38-, 47-, and 70-kDa proteins were TTPLTFQVGKGSKPG, DFDEPGHLAP, KKKRAAESGEAAEAK, ATLAEICRGTAFPDI, FVVTGRIYCDNCRAG, LPAQSPTLK, GPPKVPPGKNITATY, RFIGGVGDDY, EKEESKGIDAKA, and YFVGSVLSGG, respectively. Analysis of Nucleotide and Amino Acid Sequences—We used the NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.gov) and TIGR (www.tigr.org) data bases to search for EST nucleotide sequences or protein sequences. The GCG Program (gcg.ucr.edu) was used to compare nucleotide sequences or amino acid sequences, to construct phylogenetic trees and to translate nucleotide sequences into amino acid sequences. Subcellular locations of proteins were analyzed by use of the PSORT Program in ExPASy (us.expasy.org). RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted (17Kim H.U. Hsieh K. Ratnayake C. Huang A.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22677-22684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) from maize anthers of different developmental stages, mature pollen and germinated (after 15–30 min) pollen. A sample of 1 μg of total RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase and then used to synthesize first-strand cDNA with an oligo(dT)15 primer (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The cDNA was used as a template for RT-PCR with a pair of primers. For the gene encoding the pollen-coat 70-kDa β-glucanase, the 5′ primer (5′-CAGATCGAGAGGGCCAACGC-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-CTTGACGAGGCGGGGGTCC-3′) were designed from the coding region of the new maize gene ZmGLA3 (AY344632), which is different from those of the two known maize β-glucanases (to be described in Fig. 3). For the gene encoding the pollen-coat xylanase, the 5′ primer (5′-GGGAGGCATGACCGCTTACT-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-CTTGGTGACCGCGTTGCCG-3′) were designed from the coding region of the maize gene ZmXYN1 (AF149016). For the gene encoding the pollen-released 10-kDa protein, the 5′ primer (5′-CACCAACAATGGCCTCCAGG-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-GCTGAGTGTGTCTATAGCGTG-3′) were designed from the coding region of a maize EST clone, AY111779. For the gene encoding the pollen-released 14-kDa protein, the 5′ primer (5′-TGATGTTGCTGGTTCCAACTT-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-TGCTTAGTAATTGGAGTCTGTT-3′) were designed from the 3′-UTR of a maize profilin gene, ZmPRO1, X73279. For the gene encoding the pollen-wall 17-kDa protein, the 5′ primer (5′-GCCCCTTGAAATGAATGAAC-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-ACATTTGCGTGACATTACATTT-3′) were designed from the 3′-UTR of a maize EST clone, TC148758. For the gene encoding the pollen-released 20-kDa protein, the 5′ primer (5′-GATCTCCTTCTCCACGGACG-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-ATTCCACCTCAATTCGCCTCC-3′) were designed from the 3′-UTR of a maize EST clone, TC132556. For the gene encoding the pollen-released 23-kDa protein, the 5′ primer (5′-ATGCGCGCATGCATGCTAGC-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-AGATGGTCAAGAATTGAATTCAC-3′) were designed from the 3′-UTR of a maize EST clone, TC130551. For the gene encoding the pollen-released 35-kDa protein, the 5′ primer (5′-GTGCTGACAATACTTTAAGCCG-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-ACAACACAACATTCATGGATCC-3′) were designed from the 3′-UTR of a maize EST clone, TC148755. For the gene encoding the pollen-released 47-kDa protein, the 5′ primer (5′-CGACTGACCCATCTCTCTA-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-GAGAGAGAGAGACAAGAGGT-3′) were designed from the 3′-UTR of a maize EST clone, X57627. The PCR product was analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel and purified with the use of the QIAGENE Gel extraction kit (Qiagene, Valencia, CA). The purified PCR product was 32P-labeled with the use of Prime-a-Gene Labeling system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The 32P-labeled fragment was used as a probe for RNA blot hybridization. RNA Blot Hybridization—Each sample of 30 μg of total RNA was fractionated with the use of a 1.2% formaldehyde gel by electrophoresis. The gel was equilibrated in 10× SSC, pH 7.0 for 20 min. After equilibration, the RNAs were blotted onto a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The RNA-blotted membrane was prehybridized at 65 °C in potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.01 m EDTA, pH 8.0 for 4 h; hybridized with 32P-labeled probes (preceding paragraph) overnight; and then washed with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min; 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min; and 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min, all at 65 °C. RT-PCR Analysis of ZmGLA1, ZmGLA2, and ZmGLA3 Transcripts in Maize Anthers, Mature Pollen, and Germinated Pollen—Total RNA from maize anthers of different developmental stages, mature pollen or germinated pollen was extracted and used to synthesize first-strand cDNA, as described in a preceding section. The cDNA was used as templates for PCR with a pair of gene-specific primers. For ZmGLA1, the 5′ primer (5′-GTGTGAGGCGCTCTGATGG-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-ACACGGCTAAATAGGGTATGG-3′) were designed from the 3′-UTR of a maize β-glucanase ExoI EST clone, AY103742 (gDNA, AF225411). For ZmGLA2, the 5′ primer (5′-AGATGTACCAGAACTAGAAGAA-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-AAGAATGAGATGGCTCATATGT-3′) were designed from the 3′-UTR of a maize β-glucanase (ExoII) EST clone, AF064707. For ZmGLA3, the 5′ primer (5′-GCCGCGAGTCACGATTAGC-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-CAATCTTTTTTTAACTACACCTAC-3′) were designed from the 3′-UTR of our newly registered maize gene (GenBank™ AY344632). For a maize actin gene, the 5′ primer (5′-GGTTACTCCTTCACCACGAC-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-CAGACACTGTACTTCCTCTCAG-3′) were designed from the coding region of a maize actin gene (GenBank™, Maz56, U60514). The PCR fragments were analyzed with 1.2% agarose gels. 5′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (5′-RACE)—It was performed with the use of a 5′-RACE system (Invitrogen) according to the provided instructions. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized with a primer, 5′-GTTGTGGGGGAAGAT-3′. Primary and nested PCR products were synthesized with the primers, 5′-GGCGTTGTAGACGTCGTTGTT-3′ and 5′-CCGTGCACGGCGTCGATGC-3′, respectively. The above three primers were designed on the basis of a maize gDNA clone, BZ402366, which is highly similar to the 5′-terminus of a rice EST clone, TC81322. The sequence of the new maize gene, termed ZmGLA3 (registered as GenBank™ AY344632), was assembled from the sequenced 5′-RACE product, maize EST TC163747 and maize gDNA BZ402366, BZ533772, BZ530441, and BZ533777. Microscopy—Samples of pollen before and after protein release were observed under a Zeiss Axiophot microscope and then photographed. For immunofluorescence microscopy, germinated pollen grains having different tube lengths in the germination medium were fixed by mixing with 1 volume of 2× fixation solution (1×: 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, 50 mm PIPES buffer, pH 6.9, 2 mm MgSO4), and 15% (w/v) sucrose). The preparation was placed at room temperature for 1 h. The pollen grains were transferred to a 1× fixation solution (omitting sucrose) at room temperature for 1 h. After fixation, the pollen grains were washed with PBS (10 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl) three times for 15 min each. The pollen grains were blocked with 3% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in PBS at room temperature for 2 h. The blocked pollen grains were allowed to react with chicken antibodies against the maize pollen 10- or 17-kDa protein (1:100 dilution) in PBS containing 1% (w/v) nonfat dry milk at 4 °C overnight. After being washed with PBST (PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100) 3 times for 10 min each, the pollen grains were incubated with Cyanine 3-conjugated donkey secondary antibodies against chicken IgG or IgY (Jackson Immuno Research Lab., West Grove, PA) at room temperature for 2–3 h. After being washed with PBST three times for 10 min each, the pollen grains were mounted in an antifade reagent from SlowFade Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and viewed under a Leica SP2 UV confocal microscope. Mature Maize Pollen Was Separated into Fractions of Distinct Structures or Origins—Mature pollen was separated into four distinct fractions, the coat, a pollen-released protein fraction, the interior, and the shell. These fractions were analyzed for their protein constituents by SDS-PAGE. A coat fraction was obtained by washing the mature pollen with diethyl ether. SDS-PAGE revealed three visible protein bands, which represented only a very small proportion of the total pollen proteins (Fig. 1A). N-terminal sequencing and FPLC revealed that the 70- and 35-kDa protein bands each represented one protein (to be described) and that the 25-kDa protein band contained at least two fragments of different proteins via a search of GenBank™ protein data bases. These fragments were not studied further. Fractions of pollen-released proteins and pollen interior proteins were obtained by the following procedure. Mature pollen was shaken gently in a liquid medium of 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2 for 20 min, during which most of the pollen (about 95%) did not burst (Fig. 1, B and C). The proteins released from and those retained in the pollen were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The released proteins in the designated pollen-released protein fraction represented about 10% of the total pollen proteins and were separated into several sharp protein bands on the gel (Fig. 1A). The proteins retained in the pollen in the designated pollen interior fraction were separated into many bands. The pollen-released and interior proteins resolved in the gel were mostly non-overlapping, which indicates the selectivity of the separation procedure. After the almost complete liberation of the pollen-released proteins, the pollen still retained its interior density as observed by light microscopy (Fig. 1, B and C). Both the pollen-released and interior fractions contained some of the coat proteins, which are not visible from the stained SDS-PAGE gel because of their relatively minute amounts (Fig. 1A) but were revealed by immunoblotting with antibodies against the 35-kDa proteins (data not shown) A pollen shell fraction, representing the pollen after the pollen-released and interior proteins had been removed, was obtained by gently grinding the interior fraction and subjecting the ground materials to sucrose gradient centrifugation. A clean fraction of individual pollen shells was ob"
https://openalex.org/W1970530506,"To further develop the mechanistic understanding of small heat-shock protein (sHSP) chaperone activity, we investigate the nature of the intermediate states recognized by α-crystallin and the conformations that are stably bound. The model substrates consist of a set of well characterized, destabilized T4 Lysozyme (T4L) mutants that have been shown to differentially bind α-crystallin in a manner that reflects their free-energy of unfolding. A new approach for the detection of complex formation is introduced based on the conformational sensitivity of the fluorescent probe bimane, site-specifically introduced in T4L. Emission spectra of bimane-labeled T4L reveal two distinct patterns of intensity changes upon binding that depend on the molar ratio of α-crystallin to T4L. This directly demonstrates the two-mode nature of the binding process by the α-crystallins. Biphasic binding isotherms, obtained and analyzed over a wide range of T4L concentrations, demonstrate a substantially quenched bimane fluorescence in the low affinity-bound T4L that is similar to the quenching level observed due to denaturant unfolding. Furthermore, the pattern of intensity changes that occur upon binding of a T4L variant, bimane-labeled at an alternative solvent-exposed site, establishes a direct correlation between the quenching level observed in binding and unfolding. The results can be interpreted in terms of a model where α-crystallin binds at least two conformationally distinct non-native states of T4L, one of which is substantially unfolded and is bound with low affinity. A high affinity binding mode to compact states may be relevant to chaperone function in the lens, where protein damage is unlikely to cause global unfolding. To further develop the mechanistic understanding of small heat-shock protein (sHSP) chaperone activity, we investigate the nature of the intermediate states recognized by α-crystallin and the conformations that are stably bound. The model substrates consist of a set of well characterized, destabilized T4 Lysozyme (T4L) mutants that have been shown to differentially bind α-crystallin in a manner that reflects their free-energy of unfolding. A new approach for the detection of complex formation is introduced based on the conformational sensitivity of the fluorescent probe bimane, site-specifically introduced in T4L. Emission spectra of bimane-labeled T4L reveal two distinct patterns of intensity changes upon binding that depend on the molar ratio of α-crystallin to T4L. This directly demonstrates the two-mode nature of the binding process by the α-crystallins.

A high affinity binding mode to compact states may be relevant to chaperone function in the lens, where protein damage is unlikely to cause global unfolding. The cellular response to increased temperature and other forms of stress involves the expression of multiple superfamilies of heat-shock proteins (HSPs) 1The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat-shock protein; sHSP, small heat-shock protein; T4L, T4 Lysozyme; SEC, size-exclusion chromatography; Mes, 2-(4-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; WT, wild type; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; αB-D3, S19D/S45D/S59D; αB-D1, S45D. (1Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 437-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar). Many HSPs are molecular chaperones that recognize and bind protein non-native states thereby suppressing aggregation and facilitating refolding and/or subsequent degradation (2Xu Z. Sigler P.B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 124: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 3Grantcharova V. Alm E.J. Baker D. Horwich A.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 70-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Because the recognition process, the mechanism of substrate release, and the downstream fate of the bound substrate seem to be distinct in each superfamily, HSPs have evolved distinct roles in the context of the life cycle of proteins as well as during stress (2Xu Z. Sigler P.B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 124: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are a ubiquitous superfamily of heat-shock proteins characterized by the relatively small mass of the polypeptide chain and the presence of a conserved protein module in their C termini, the α-crystallin domain (4Van Montfort R. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2001; 59: 105-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 5Macrae T.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 899-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). They assemble into oligomeric structures with varying degrees of order and substantial divergence in size and symmetry across the evolutionary spectrum. Ten sHSPs have been identified in the human genome (6Kappe G. Franck E. Veschuure P. Boelens W.C. Leunissen J.A. De Jong W.W. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Constitutive expression of two sHSPs, the α-crystallins of the vertebrate lens, plays a critical role in the acquisition and maintenance of lens optical properties (7Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar, 8Horwitz J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 9Cobb B.A. Petrash J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the heart, αB-crystallin and heat-shock protein 27 are involved in stress tolerance (10Verschuure P. Croes Y.

Inherited mutations in the α-crystallins have been linked to pathogenic conditions such as cataract and desmin-related myopathy (11Litt M. Kramer P. Lamorticella D.M. Murphey W. Lovrien E.W.

Recent studies have led to an outline of the mechanism of recognition and binding of non-native protein states by αA- and αB-crystallin (13Mchaourab H.S. Dodson E.K. Koteiche H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40557-40566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14Koteiche H.A. Mchaourab H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10361-10367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Both proteins are “sensors” of protein stability: they are able to distinguish between mutants of T4 lysozyme (T4L) that have similar crystal structures but different free energies of folding. A two-mode binding model has been proposed primarily on the basis of binding isotherms that do not conform to those expected from one set of independent binding sites (13Mchaourab H.S. Dodson E.K. Koteiche H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40557-40566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14Koteiche H.A. Mchaourab H.S. J. Biol.

The term “mode” was employed to high-light that the two sets of binding sites may be overlapping or identical. In this case, the change in the apparent number of binding sites reflects a shift in the equilibrium between multiple forms of the dynamic α-crystallin oligomer. One of the characteristics that distinguish sHSP chaperone function is the hypothesized role of their flexible and dynamic oligomers (15Van Montfort R.L. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 16Sobott F. Benesch J.L. Vierling E. Robinson C.V. J. Biol.

Temperature and phosphorylation-induced activation of binding have been interpreted in terms of the transient dissociation of the oligomeric structure (14Koteiche H.A. Mchaourab H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10361-10367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 19Das K.P. Surewicz W.K.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12681-12688Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Analysis of the thermodynamics of T4L binding by the α-crystallins suggests a conformational specificity for each mode, with the low affinity mode reserved for more globally unfolded states (13Mchaourab H.S. Dodson E.K. Koteiche H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40557-40566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, direct evidence of conformational heterogeneity was masked by the similar spectroscopic signatures of T4L bound through the two modes. The basis of the previously reported binding assay was the change in the motional state of a nitroxide spin label introduced in T4L. Upon binding, the state transitions from highly mobile to almost immobile on the time scale of continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). In general, the determinants of the spin label mobility include the backbone configuration at the site of attachment and details of the local structural environment (23Mchaourab H.S. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7692-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). However, steric contacts with the chaperone seem to dominate the spin label mobility in bound T4L leading to a similar motional state in the two modes. Therefore, to explore the nature of the conformational states of bound T4L and the environments in which they are bound, we have developed a fluorescence-based assay for the detection of complex formation between sHSP and their substrates. A bimane probe is attached at the non-destabilizing cysteine of T4L instead of the spin label, and the changes in its fluorescence properties are detected upon binding. The rationale for the choice of the bimane probe is based primarily on the sensitivity of its parameters, such as the quantum yield and the emission wavelength, to the local protein and solvent environments (24Mansoor S.E. Mchaourab H.S. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16383-16393Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25Mansoor S.E. Mchaourab H.S. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, the bimane group is comparatively small and is less likely than other bulkier fluorophors to significantly complicate the thermodynamics of the problem. Binding of bimane-labeled T4L mutants results in a change in the fluorescence characteristics, the nature of which depends on the molar ratio of T4L to α-crystallin. This provides direct evidence of two distinct modes of binding. Furthermore, binding through the low affinity mode results in changes in the bimane emission intensity that are similar to those observed during denaturant unfolding. This result indicates that the T4L bound with low affinity is substantially unfolded. The results of this report establish a general, high sensitivity assay that can be used for detection of binding by heat-shock proteins. Cloning and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The detailed description of the cloning and site-directed mutagenesis of both αB-crystallin and T4L were previously reported (13Mchaourab H.S. Dodson E.K.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7692-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). In this report, single-site mutants are named by specifying the original residue, the number of the residue followed by the new residue. For bimane-labeled mutants, the suffix “BI” is used. Protein Expression, Purification, and Labeling—The expression and purification of T4L mutants, αB-crystallin, and αB-crystallin phosphorylation mimics were carried out as previously described (13Mchaourab H.S. Dodson E.K. Koteiche H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40557-40566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14Koteiche H.A. Mchaourab H.S. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7692-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Briefly, T4L mutants were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain K38 using permissive induction temperatures (13Mchaourab H.S. Dodson E.K. Koteiche H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40557-40566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Sequential cation exchange and size-exclusion chromatographies were used to purify the mutants to apparent homogeneity. Following elution from the cation-exchange column, the mutants were incubated with a 10-fold molar excess of monobromobimane in a pH 7.6-buffered solution. The reaction (Scheme 1) was allowed to proceed for 2 h at room temperature and then overnight at 4 °C. The reaction mixture was then purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Superdex 75 column equilibrated with the appropriate buffer. Different pH values were obtained by varying the molar ratios of Mes and Tris while maintaining the total ionic strength constant. The labeling efficiency was determined by comparing the absorption at 280 and 380 nm. Consistently, a 280/380 ratio of 10:1 was obtained. This ratio indicates stoichiometric labeling of the introduced cysteine (24Mansoor S.E. Mchaourab H.S. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16383-16393Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using an extinction coefficient of 1.228 cm2·mg–1 for T4L and 0.947 cm2·mg–1 for αB-crystallin. αB-crystallin and its variants were purified using sequential anion exchange and SEC. For the triply phosphorylated analog, S19D/S45D/S59D, a phenyl-Sepharose affinity chromatography step was inserted prior to SEC to further purify the protein as previously described (14Koteiche H.A. Mchaourab H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10361-10367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Denaturant-unfolding Curves—To determine the free energy of unfolding, ΔG unf, of select bimane-labeled mutants, unfolding curves were constructed by monitoring tryptophan emission as a function of urea concentration. Bimane emission was also monitored to determine the effect of global unfolding on the fluorescence characteristics. The curves were then fit to a two-state unfolding model using non-linear least squares as described previously (26Pace C.N. Shaw K.L. Proteins. 2000; 4: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Six parameters were used to fit the data: a slope and an intercept for the pretransition and posttransition regions, ΔG unf, and m, the denaturant dependence of the free energy of unfolding, for the transition region. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Binding studies of fluorescence-labeled T4L mutants were carried out on a Photon Technology International L-format spectrofluorometer equipped with a sample holder controlled by a peltier heater/cooler. Samples containing a constant concentration of a T4L mutant and varying concentrations of αB-crystallin were incubated at the desired temperature for 2 h. αB-crystallin and T4L solutions were buffered by a combination of Mes and Tris and contained 50 mm NaCl. Fluorescence emission spectra of the samples were recorded between 400 and 500 nm by exciting the bimane molecule at 380 nm. Analysis of Binding Isotherms—Using the appropriate equations, both simulations and curve fitting were performed using the program Origin (OriginLab Inc.). For non-linear least-square fits, the Levenberg-Marquart method was used. Equilibrium Binding of T4L to α-Crystallin: General Methodology—The chaperone function of sHSP involves the recognition of non-native states of their substrate. Although such states become abundant following exposure to extreme physicochemical conditions, they are populated under native conditions albeit to a small extent. Presumably, the rare excursions to these partially or globally unfolded states result in transient binding to sHSP. To achieve a stable complex, i.e. a significant population of substrate-chaperone complex, the energetics of binding have to be comparable to the energetics that define the refolding from the binding-competent states to the native state. In vitro, this balance can be manipulated by reducing the stability of the native state of a given protein. For this purpose, a set of destabilized mutants of T4L, most having a crystal structure similar to that of the WT (27Matthews B.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), were constructed. Each has an introduced cysteine at a non-destabilizing site for the attachment of a spectroscopic reporter group. The properties of the reporter group have to be sensitive to the association with the chaperone thus allowing the observation and quantitation of the complex. In this report, the T4L mutants were labeled either at position 151 or at position 116 with the probe monobromobimane. Most of the binding studies were carried out using the triply phosphorylated analog of αB-crystallin, αB-D3 (S19D/S45D/S59D), to achieve the significant binding required for detailed statistical analysis of the data (14Koteiche H.A. Mchaourab H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10361-10367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Because both WT αA- and αB-crystallin use two-mode binding (13Mchaourab H.S. Dodson E.K. Koteiche H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40557-40566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14Koteiche H.A. Mchaourab H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10361-10367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the conclusions concerning the conformations of bound T4L apply to both proteins. Fig. 1 shows the emission spectra of bimane-labeled T4L-L99A/A130S in the absence and presence of αB-D3 at 23 °C, pH 8. Comparison of these spectra reveals significant changes in the fluorescence characteristics of the bimane group that depend on the molar ratio of T4L to αB-D3. In the presence of a large excess of αB-D3, corresponding to high affinity binding, there is a 14-nm shift in the maximum emission wavelength, λmax, and a drop in the fluorescence intensity. In the case of an equimolar ratio, corresponding to binding through both modes of affinities, a substantial drop in the emission intensity is observed. Irrespective of the origin of the quenching of the bimane emission, it must necessarily arise from the population of T4L bound with low affinity, because high affinity binding does not result in extensive quenching. Consequently, the variation in the emission intensity at a single wavelength (460 nm) as a function of the molar ratio between αB-D3 and T4L is biphasic, as shown in Fig. 1b. The wavelength was selected to maximize the changes in the emission intensity across the titration range. A similar biphasic curve is obtained if the wavelength is chosen to be 468 nm, the emission λmax of free T4L. It is noted that the biphasic behavior is observed in the direct binding curve and is not deduced from its reciprocal representation. Given the sensitivity of the bimane to its environment, this result indicates that either there are two physically distinct sets of binding sites and/or that T4L is binding in two distinct conformations that have altered bimane fluorescence. Minimalist Two-mode Binding Model for Analysis of the Change in the Fluorescence Intensity—The equation corresponding to two-mode binding is given by, rt=r1+r2(Eq. 1) where ri=niL/(KDi+L)(i=1or2)(Eq. 2) In Equation 2, r i is the ratio of bound T4L to total α-crystallin in a given mode of binding, L is the fraction of free, native state T4L, n i is the number of binding sites, and KD i is the apparent dissociation constant associated with each binding mode. Because α-crystallin does not bind the native state of T4L, KD i is a ratio between the intrinsic dissociation constant and the equilibrium constant that characterizes the interconversion of T4L between the native state and the state recognized by the chaperone. Binding of spin-labeled T4L to α-crystallin results in two distinct spectroscopic observables that arise from the bound and free species. This allows the direct measurement of the fractional population of free T4L as a function of added α-crystallin. In contrast, the various states of bimane-labeled T4L contribute to the same fluorescence envelope. Binding is inferred from changes in the intensity and shifts in the emission λmax. The former quantity, although proportional to the population of the various microstates, cannot be directly interpreted in terms of the bound and free T4L fractions. Therefore, to quantitatively analyze the binding curve of Fig. 1b, Equation 2 has to be rewritten such that L is numerically determined based on the known concentrations of added T4L and αB-D3, the unknown binding parameters n 1, n 2, KD 1, KD 2, and the relative fluorescent emission intensities of T4L in each mode, F 1 and F 2, as outlined previously (28Wang Z.X. Jiang R.F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The changes in the fluorescence intensity at a single wavelength expected for two-mode binding are illustrated in Fig. 2. Panel a shows the change in the binding isotherms for different values of F 2, the emission intensity in the low affinity mode. It is clear that the biphasic shape is the direct result of the different emission intensity in each binding mode. Panel b illustrates the effects of varying KD 2 on the shape of the binding isotherms. The increase in KD 2 reduces the dip and shifts its position toward higher molar ratio of chaperone to T4L. This panel demonstrates two important properties of this detection method. First, as long as the two fluorescence signals are different enough, the two-mode nature of the binding process can be detected even if KD 2 is larger than the concentration of the substrate used. The second property is best appreciated by comparing the direct binding curves to the corresponding double-reciprocal curves (1/r versus 1/L) obtained using the same thermodynamic parameters and shown in Fig. 2c. For intermediate ratios of KD 1 to KD 2, the reciprocal representation is linear, which is normally interpreted to imply a single binding mode having a larger apparent dissociation constant. In contrast, the fluorescence binding curve indicates two-mode binding. In fact, the sensitivity of the reciprocal representation to two-mode binding occurs only for KD 2 » KD 1. The ability to detect two-mode binding in the intermediate range using the double-reciprocal representation is further reduced by the limited range of L dictated by the sensitivity consideration of EPR spectroscopy (13Mchaourab H.S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 10361-10367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Single-mode, High Affinity Binding—To eliminate binding at the low affinity site, we have previously used either the more stable T4L mutants or pH values that reduce the affinity of the α-crystallins (14Koteiche H.A. Mchaourab H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10361-10367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Given the sensitivity range of fluorescence spectroscopy, an alternative approach is to use concentrations of T4L significantly below KD 2. Fig. 3a shows the binding isotherm of αB-D3 to T4L-D70N obtained at 10 μm. The super-imposed curve is a non-linear least squares fit to a single mode of binding. The resulting parameters reported in Table I indicate that the number of high affinity sites, n 1, is 0.25, which is at variance with the results reported previously using EPR detection of binding. The value of 0.5 reported by Koteiche and Mchaourab (14Koteiche H.A. Mchaourab H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10361-10367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) was based on the binding isotherms of L99A and L99A/A130S. At concentrations of T4L similar to those used in the EPR binding assay, both of these mutants have biphasic isotherms (see below).Table INumber of binding sites, n, and dissociation constants, KD, of T4L-D70N binding to αR-D3 at 23 ± 1 °CT4L mutantn 1K D1F 1μ mD70N (10 μm)0.261.140.82D70N (40 μm)0.317.240.75D70N (40 μm, EPR)0.3212 Open table in a new tab Further insight into the origin of the difference in the thermodynamic parameters between the two methods was obtained from the analysis of two binding curves constructed using either bimane-labeled or spin-labeled T4L-D70N at a concentration of 40 μm. The binding curve obtained from EPR spectroscopy 2H. A. Koteiche and H. S. Mchaourab, unpublished results. results in n 1 = 0.33 and a KD 1 of about 13 μm, both of which are close to those obtained from the corresponding 40 μm fluorescence binding isotherm, shown in Fig. 3a. However, the KD obtained at this T4L concentration is significantly larger than the one obtained at 10 μm. The origin of these variations in both n and KD must arise from a small contribution by the low affinity mode at the higher concentration, a contribution not explicitly detectable in the shape of either isotherms due to a large KD 2. A possible explanation for the difference in the KD 1 for D70N obtained by EPR and fluorescence is the marginally lower stability of D70N labeled with the bimane relative to the spin-labeled version as discussed below. Another example of the effect of undetected contribution by the low affinity mode is the binding of the T4L mutants to the singly phosphorylated mutants of αB-crystallin (14Koteiche H.A. Mchaourab H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10361-10367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). High affinity binding was reported to be the predominant mode of binding by the single-phosphorylation analogs of αB-crystallin at 23°C, pH 8. Fig. 3b shows the binding isotherm of L99A/A130S to the αB-crystallin mutant S45D (αB-D1) at 10 μm. The initial part of the curve can be fit assuming predominant binding at a single set of sites. However, the slow increase in slope, observed at the high ratios of αB-D1 to T4L, indicates a minor contribution from the low affinity mode. Consistent with this interpretation, the sloping baseline is less pronounced in the 10 μm isotherm of T4L-L99A, which has a larger ΔG unf (Fig. 3b) suggesting diminished binding through the low affinity mode. Furthermore, Fig. 3c shows that increasing the concentration of T4L-L99A/A130S to 40 μm, similar to the concentration used for EPR detection, enhances binding at the low affinity mode and results in a biphasic isotherm. It is noted that, although the shape of the isotherm indicates two-mode binding, the contribution of the low affinity mode is not enough to allow a unique fit. Taken together, these results indicate that for certain mutants the contribution by the low affinity mode persists even at low concentrations.

Activation of Two-mode Binding Detected by Bimane Fluorescence— Fig. 4 shows the binding isotherms of T4L-L99A/A130S and L99A/F153A to αB-D3 at pH 7.2, 23 °C. Both isotherms display the biphasic changes in fluorescence intensity indicative of two-mode binding. T4L-L99A/F153A is the most destabilized mutant in the set presented in this report with a ΔG unf of about 4.5 kcal/mol (14Koteiche H.A. Mchaourab H.S. J. Biol.

The results of the non-linear least square fits in Table II confirm the expected higher affinity of αB-D3 to T4L-L99A/F153A relative to T4L-L99A/A130S. To optimize the extent of binding for each mutant, the binding curve for T4L-L99A/F153A was obtained at 10 μm, whereas that for T4L-L99A/A130S was obtained at 40 μm.Table IINumber of binding sites, n, and dissoc"
https://openalex.org/W2012008110,"CD44 is the main cell surface receptor for hyaluronic acid (HA) and contains a functional HA-binding domain (HABD) composed of a Link module with N- and C-terminal extensions. The contact residues of human CD44 HABD for HA have been determined by cross-saturation experiments and mapped on the topology of CD44 HABD, which we elucidated by NMR. The contact residues are distributed in both the consensus fold for the Link module superfamily and the additional structural elements consisting of the flanking regions. Interestingly, the contact residues exhibit small changes in chemical shift upon HA binding. In contrast, the residues with large chemical shift changes are localized in the C-terminal extension and the first α-helix and are generally inconsistent with the contact residues. These results suggest that, upon ligand binding, the C-terminal extension and the first α-helix undergo significant conformational changes, which may account for the broad ligand specificity of CD44 HABD.

CD44 reportedly recognizes a variety of ligands (1Lesley J. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 271-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 2Naor D. Sionov R.V. Ish-Shalom D. Adv.

The most investigated aspect of CD44 function is its ability to bind hyaluronic acid (HA), 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronic acid; ChS, chondroitin sulfate; TSG-6, tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6; Ch4S, chondroitin 4-sulfate; Ch6S, chondroitin 6-sulfate; CS, cross-saturation; AMS, 4-acetoamide-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonate 2Na; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence.1The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronic acid; ChS, chondroitin sulfate; TSG-6, tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6; Ch4S, chondroitin 4-sulfate; Ch6S, chondroitin 6-sulfate; CS, cross-saturation; AMS, 4-acetoamide-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonate 2Na; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence. a major component of the extracellular matrix (1Lesley J.

HA is a very high molecular mass glycosaminoglycan, composed of a repeating disaccharide, d-glucuronic acid (β1→3) N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (β1→4) (4Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar). The binding of CD44 to HA has been implicated in both cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix components and cellular signaling cascades (1Lesley J. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 271-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 2Naor D. Sionov R.V. Ish-Shalom D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 241-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ponta H. Sherman L.

In addition to HA, CD44 interacts with the chondroitin sulfate (ChS) proteoglycans, serglycin (8Toyama-Sorimachi N. Miyasaka M. J.

Miyasaka M. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The CD44-binding elements on these proteoglycans are ChS side chains. These ChS proteoglycans may be involved in the adherence and activation of CD44-expressing cells.CD44 has an N-terminal functional domain that interacts with the HA and ChS chains (11Kawashima H Hirose M.

Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). This ligand recognition domain contains a homology region, termed the Link module (14Stamenkovic I. Amiot M. Pesando J.M. Seed B. Cell. 1989; 56: 1057-1062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 15Goldstein L.A. Zhou D.F.H. Picker L.J. Minty C.N. Bargatze R.F. Ding J.F. Butcher E.C.

Link modules are found in extracellular matrix molecules (link protein, aggrecan, versican, neurocan, and brevican) and the protein product of tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6). The HA-binding domains from Link module-containing proteins are divided into three subgroups as described in Ref. 16Day A.J. Prestwich G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4585-4588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar. Briefly, a single Link module, a Link module with N- and C-terminal extensions, and a pair of Link modules, which are sufficient for a high affinity interaction with HA, are classified as Types A, B, and C, respectively. In addition, a single Link module from TSG-6, belonging to Type A, interacts specifically with chondroitin 4-sulfate (Ch4S) but not with chondroitin 6-sulfate (Ch6S) (17Parkar A.A. Day A.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Bovine link protein, which contains the Type C Link module, binds to neither Ch4S nor Ch6S (18Rosenberg L. Tang L.H. Pal S. Johnson T.L. Choi H.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18071-18077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, CD44, which belongs to Type B, interacts with Ch4S, Ch6S, chondroitin, and other ChS chains (11Kawashima H Hirose M. Hirose J. Nagakubo D. Plass A.H.K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 12921-12930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), suggesting that the HA-binding domain of CD44 has a broader ChS binding specificity than those of the TSG-6 and link proteins. The three-dimensional structure and ligand-binding site of Type A, i.e. the TSG-6 Link module, have been determined by NMR (20Kohda D. Morton C.J. Parkar A.A. Hatanaka H. Inagaki F.M. Campbell I.D.

Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 763-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast, no structural information about Type B, including CD44, is available.In the present study, a combination of cross-saturation and chemical shift perturbation experiments has been applied to the CD44 HA-binding domain-HA complex to separate the direct intermolecular contacts from the effects due to ligand-induced conformational changes (22Wuthrich K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 188-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Takahashi H. Nakanishi T. Kami K. Arata Y. Shimada I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Significant conformational changes were observed in the C-terminal extension and the first α-helix, suggesting a correlation between the conformational changes and the broad ligand specificity of the CD44 HA-binding domain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCD44 HABD and HA Sample Preparation—The human CD44 HABD gene (residues 21–178) was amplified by PCR from a cDNA encoding human CD44-IgG fusion protein (3Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar, 24Banerji S. Day A.J. Kahmann J.D. Jackson D.G. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and was cloned into the pET11a vector (Novagen) (24Banerji S. Day A.J. Kahmann J.D. Jackson D.G. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). CD44 HABD was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) codon Plus RP (Stratagene) without affinity tags and then was purified as described previously (24Banerji S. Day A.J. Kahmann J.D. Jackson D.G. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For the unlabeled protein, the transformed cells were grown in Luria-Bertani broth. Uniformly 15N- and 13C/15N-labeled proteins were prepared by growing cells in M9 medium containing 15NH4Cl (1 g/liter) and unlabeled or [U-13C]glucose (2 g/liter) supplemented with Celtone-N or -CN powder (1 g/liter; Martek). Similarly, the uniformly 2H/15N-labeled protein was prepared using M9 medium in 99.9% 2H2O containing 15NH4Cl (1 g/liter) and [U-2H] glucose (98%; 2 g/liter) supplemented with Celtone-DN powder (1 g/liter). In addition, several selective 15N labelings of one type of amino acid were carried out to provide starting points for the sequential assignments (25Muchmore D.C. McIntosh L.P. Russell C.B. Anderson D.E. Dahlquist F.W. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 177: 44-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar).The purified and lyophilized protein was dissolved in 6 m guanidine, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl and was dialyzed against H2O/2H2O (9/1) buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.7, and 150 mm NaCl. In cross-saturation (CS) experiments, the proton content of the solvent was lowered to 20% to suppress the spin diffusion caused by the exchangeable amide protons in CD44 HABD. Sample concentrations were 0.3 mm (uniformly 15N-labeled protein for titration experiments), 2.0 mm (13C/15N-labeled for sequential assignments), and 1.2 mm (2H/15N-labeled for CS experiments).HA6 and HA∼34 were prepared as described previously (26Tawada A. Masa T. Oonuki Y. Watanabe A. Matsuzaki Y. Asari A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A stock solution of 60 mm HA6 or 14 mm HA∼34 was added to the CD44 HABD samples.Characterization of CD44 HABD—The redox states of the refolded CD44 HABD were analyzed by the 4-acetoamide-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonate 2Na (AMS) modification and SDS-PAGE, as described by Uchida et al. (27Uchida K. Mori H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30862-30868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed using a BIAcore 2000 instrument (Biacore AB). Biotinylated HA was prepared as described previously (28Yu Q. Toole B.P. BioTechniques. 1995; 19 (126–129): 122-124PubMed Google Scholar) and was immobilized onto the sensor chip SA (Biacore AB), resulting in a signal of 100 resonance units. The binding assay was performed in running buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 150 mm NaCl) at flow rate of 10 μl min–1, using serial dilutions of CD44 HABD in the 5–40 μm range. The dissociation constants (Kd) were obtained from the steady-state curve fitting analysis, using the BIAevaluation software, version 3.0 (Biacore AB).NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were performed at 25 °C on Bruker DRX 400, Avance 500, or Avance 600 spectrometers. The sequential assignments of the 1HN, 15N, 13Cα, and 13Cβ chemical shifts of CD44 HABD in the unbound and HA∼34 bound states were achieved by the sets of three-dimensional triple resonance experiments (HNCA, HN(CO)CA, CBCA(CO)NH, and HNCACB) (29Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). All spectra were processed by NMRPipe (30Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11379) Google Scholar), and data analysis was assisted by ANSIG (31Kraulis J. Clore G.M. Nilges M. Jones T.A. Pettersson G. Knowles J. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7241-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Gln21, Asn94, Ser95, and Asn100 in the unbound state, and Gln21, Tyr42, Ser43, Asn110, Thr111, Asp128, Thr130, and Ile143 in the HA-bound state, were not able to be assigned due to line broadening. Inter-proton NOEs were derived from three-dimensional 15N-edited and two-dimensional NOESY spectra recorded with mixing times of 60 and 100 ms, respectively. These NOESY spectra were processed by X-win NMR, and the data analysis was assisted by the Sparky software (32Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco, CA2001Google Scholar). In the HA∼34-bound state, the NOE cross-peak assignments were limited by signal broadening, due to the high molecular mass of the complex.In the measurement of the diffusion coefficients of CD44 HABD by pulsed-field gradient, the pulsed-field gradient longitudinal eddy-current delay pulse sequence was used (33Gibbs S.J. Charles S. Johnson J. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 93: 395-402Google Scholar). The magnitude of the signal from the methyl protons at ∼0.8 ppm was used for determining the signal intensities of the protein.In the CS experiments, the molar ratio of HA∼34 to CD44 HABD was set to 1.7:1. The CS experiments were performed using the pulse scheme (23Takahashi H. Nakanishi T. Kami K. Arata Y. Shimada I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), with a minor modification from the transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy-type coherence transfer to the insensitive nuclei enhanced by polarization transfer-type one (34Mori S. Abeygunawardana C. Johnson M.O. van Zijl P.C. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1995; 108: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The saturation for the HA protons was made using continuous-wave RF irradiation. The saturation frequency was set at 1.9 ppm (methyl protons) or 3.5 ppm (ring protons). The reduction ratios of the signal intensities were calculated with the average of the results from these two experiments. The results of significantly overlapped residues were excluded. Each measurement time was 48 h, with a relaxation delay of 1.5 s and a saturation time of 2.0 s.RESULTSCharacterization of CD44 HABD—The boundaries of CD44 HABD were defined by analyses using truncations and site-directed mutagenesis (13Peach R.J. Hollenbaugh D. Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). We refer to the Link module of CD44 (residues 32–124) as CD44 LM, and the minimum region required for HA binding (residues 21–178) as CD44 HABD (HA-binding domain), as shown in Fig. 1A. Recombinant CD44 HABD was prepared based on the method developed by Banerji et al. (24Banerji S. Day A.J. Kahmann J.D. Jackson D.G. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 1B, the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of CD44 HABD is well dispersed, indicating that CD44 HABD is a structural domain. Banerji et al. (24Banerji S. Day A.J. Kahmann J.D. Jackson D.G. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) reported that CD44 HABD retains its reactivity with several conformation-sensitive antibodies and has a similar HA binding activity to that of CD44 molecules expressed in eukaryotic cells. To provide further evidence for the proper folding and function of CD44 HABD, we performed additional analyses. First, to examine the redox states of the six cysteine residues with CD44 HABD, we used AMS, which binds to the sulfhydryl (SH) group (27Uchida K. Mori H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30862-30868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). CD44 HABD showed an upward shift in its position on an SDS gel when it was treated with AMS in the presence of dithiothreitol. No such shift was observed in the absence of dithiothreitol (data not shown). These results indicated that CD44 HABD contains three disulfide bonds and no free SH group. Second, to evaluate the HA binding activity of CD44 HABD, surface plasmon resonance measurements were employed. The results showed that CD44 HABD has HA binding activity, and the dissociation constant (Kd) for CD44 HABD toward the HA 250-mer is 2.7 × 10–5m (the Kd for the monomeric CD44Rg protein, expressed in ldl-D cells and deglycosylated, toward the HA 60-mer is 5 × 10–6m (35Skelton T.P. Zeng C. Nocks A. Stamenkovic I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 431-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar)). Finally, the in vitro refolding of CD44 HABD using DsbC, a disulfide isomerase with chaperone activity (36Chen J. Song J. Zhang S. Wang Y. Cui D. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19601-19605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), was achieved. By SDS-PAGE, the resultant product was shown to be identical to the protein prepared by the reported method, suggesting that CD44 HABD adopts a native fold. The details of the refolding method using DsbC will be reported elsewhere. Taken together, these results strongly support the idea that CD44 HABD retains the native fold and the proper functions.Topology of CD44 HABD—As a first step toward elucidating the molecular basis for the ligand recognition by CD44 HABD, we investigated the topology of CD44 HABD in an unbound state. By three-dimensional NMR analyses, we assigned the main chain resonance of CD44 HABD (29Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). On the basis of both the NOE connectivities observed among the main chain CαH and HN resonances and the chemical shift index analysis (37Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar), we determined the secondary structure and the topology of CD44 HABD (Fig. 1, D and E). CD44 HABD was identified as a structural domain, comprising two α-helices (α1, 46–56; α2, 63–71) and two β-sheets. Sheet I is composed of five strands: βa (residues 22–27), βb (34Mori S. Abeygunawardana C. Johnson M.O. van Zijl P.C. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1995; 108: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 35Skelton T.P. Zeng C. Nocks A. Stamenkovic I. J.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4427-4434PubMed Google Scholar), βe (116–118), βf (144–148), and βg (155–158). Sheet II is a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet: βc (79–82) and βd (85–88). A comparison of the topology with that of TSG-6 indicated that CD44 LM adopts the consensus fold for the Link module superfamily (20Kohda D. Morton C.J. Parkar A.A. Hatanaka H. Inagaki F.M. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 767-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the N- and C-terminal extensions form three additional β-strands (βa, βf, and βg) to sheet I of the consensus fold (Fig. 1E, green).Cross-saturation Experiments—To identify the residues of CD44 HABD that contact HA, CS experiments were performed (23Takahashi H. Nakanishi T. Kami K. Arata Y. Shimada I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). HA oligosaccharides of defined lengths were prepared, as reported by Tawada et al. (26Tawada A. Masa T. Oonuki Y. Watanabe A. Matsuzaki Y. Asari A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). HA with an average molecular mass of 6.9 kDa (termed HA∼34) was selected as a saturation-donating partner from several HA oligomers for the following reasons. First, HA∼34 is involved in many biological processes, such as the induction of Fas expression and the Fas-mediated apoptosis of synovial cells (38Fujii K. Fujii Y. Hubscher S. Tanaka Y. J.

Second, HA∼34 is likely to fully cover the HA-binding surface of CD44 HABD. Finally, the saturation can be transferred more effectively from HA∼34 to the labeled CD44 HABD than from short-chain HA oligosaccharides (e.g. the HA hexasaccharide, termed HA6) in the complex. Pulsed-field gradient NMR experiments (33Gibbs S.J. Charles S. Johnson J. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 93: 395-402Google Scholar) generated diffusion coefficients of CD44 HABD in complex with HA∼34 and HA6 of 0.6 × 10–10 m2/s and 1.1 × 10–10 m2/s at 25 °C, respectively, indicating that the rotational correlation time of the HA∼34 bound complex is longer than that of the HA6 bound complex. Indeed, the CS phenomena were efficiently observed for the CD44 HABD-HA∼34 complex.Fig. 2Overview and NMR spectra of cross-saturation experiments.

The rf irradiation applied to the complex resulted in selective intensity losses for the CD44 HABD resonances by the CS phenomena (Fig. 2B). On the basis of the spectra for the complex with and without irradiation, the reduction ratios of the peak intensities were calculated (Fig. 3A). The residues strongly affected by the irradiation were mapped on the topology of CD44 HABD (Fig. 3D). The affected residues are distributed on both the consensus fold and the additional structural elements consisting of the flanking regions.Fig. 3Comparison between cross-saturation and chemical shift perturbation experiments.

The residues with large chemical shift differences are also mapped on the topology of CD44 HABD. Interestingly, these residues are mostly localized on the C-terminal extension and the α1 helix, designated as the Shift region (Fig. 3D, colored in light yellow), and they are generally inconsistent with the contact residues. Significant chemical shift changes upon HA binding are observed in the 13Cα resonance of the residues in the Shift region (data not shown), supporting the idea that the conformational changes upon HA binding occur in this region.The amino acids of CD44 HABD that mediate the interactions with HA have been investigated by site directed mutagenesis (13Peach R.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 338-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Fourteen residues have been shown to be important in HA binding (Fig. 3D). Twelve residues (i.e. Arg29, Lys38, Arg41, Tyr42, Lys68, Arg78, Tyr79, Asn100, Asn101, Tyr105, Arg150, and Arg154) are located either within or in close proximity to the HA-binding site. On the other hand, Lys158 and Arg162 are apart from the binding site. We cannot completely rule out the possibility that CS effect is attenuated by the flexibility in the Shift region. Therefore, CS experiments using side chain resonances are currently under way to examine the importance of these residues in HA binding.DISCUSSIONThe HA-binding site of CD44 HABD was successfully identified by the cross-saturation experiments in the present study. The N-linked glycosylation sites of CD44 HABD, previously shown to be involved in the regulation of HA binding (41Lesley J. Hyman R. Front.

One of the best examples of the importance of these neurotransmitter transporters comes from studies of dopamine transporter knock-out mice; the decay of extracellular dopamine in brain slices of such mice is about 100 times longer than normal (3Giros B.

It should be noted, however, that there is still some dispute on this issue. In a recent report (10Loo D.D.F. Eskandari S. Boorer K.J. Sarkar H.K. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37414-37422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that during sodium-coupled GABA transport obligatory chlorideout/chloridein exchange takes place. GAT-1, as well as the other members of the family, is predicted to have twelve transmembrane domains linked by hydrophilic loops with the amino and carboxyl termini residing inside the cell (5Guastella J.

Studies on the serotonin transporter SERT indicate that the theoretical topological model is correct (11Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol.

Mutagenesis studies, in particular on GAT-1 and SERT, but also on other members of the family, suggest the importance of transmembrane domains I and III in the interaction of the transporters with the neurotransmitters, as well as with sodium and chloride (12Pantanowitz S.

Studies on the related dopamine and serotonin transporters indicate that the equivalent residues of cysteine 164 and 173 located in the second extracellular loop form a disulfide bond (17Wang J.B. Moriaki A. Uhl G.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1416-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G.

Thus cysteine 74, located in the first extracellular loop, is the only cysteine residue that reacts with impermeant MTS reagents. It appears that modification of this residue causes only modest inhibition of GABA transport in GAT-1 even when relatively high concentrations of MTSET are used (19Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The reagent (2-aminoethyl)methane thiosulfonate (MTSEA) has a definite membrane permeability and can react with cysteine 399, which is located on the intracellular loop connecting transmembrane domains VIII and IX (20Golovanevsky V. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23020-23026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The accessibility of cysteine 399 is dependent on the conformation of the transporter (20Golovanevsky V. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23020-23026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Replacement of residues in extracellular loop IV has been shown to influence the apparent affinity of GAT-1 for GABA (21Tamura S. Nelson H. Tamura A. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28712-28715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, extracellular loop IV does not tolerate deletions of single amino acid residues (22Kanner B.I. Bendahan A. Pantanowitz S. Su H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this report we have addressed the question of whether this loop may undergo conformational changes during the transport cycle. Cysteine residues have been engineered at various positions of this loop, and several positions appear to be conformationally sensitive. Interestingly, the cosubstrates sodium and chloride have opposite effects on the accessibility of the engineered cysteine residues in the extracellular loop as compared with that of the internally located cysteine 399.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration and Subcloning of Mutants—Mutations were made by site-directed mutagenesis of the wild-type GAT-1 in the vector pBluescript SK(–) (Stratagene) according to the Kunkel method as described (23Kunkel T.A.

From one of the transformants, single-stranded uracil-containing DNA was isolated upon growth in uridine-containing medium according to the standard protocol from Stratagene using helper phage R408. This yields the sense strand, and consequently mutagenic primers were designed to be antisense. Mutants A364C/S and L366C/S were subcloned into a construct containing C74A-GAT-1 in the pOG1 vector using the unique restriction enzymes NheI and PinAI. The pOG1 vector is an oocyte expression vector that contains a 5′-untranslated Xenopus β-globin sequence, the T7 RNA promoter, and a3′-poly(A) signal. The above mutants and the other mutants described in this study were also subcloned into a construct containing wild-type GAT-1 in pBluescript SK(–) using the above two restriction sites. The coding and non-coding strands were sequenced between the above two restriction sites.Cell Growth and Expression—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine.

Chem. 2000; 275: 34106-34113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Inhibition Studies with Sulfhydryl Reagents—Before the transport measurements, the cells adhering to 24-well plates were washed with the transport medium containing 150 mm choline chloride instead of NaCl. Each well was then incubated at room temperature with 200 μl of the preincubation medium (the different compositions are indicated in the figure legends). After 5 min, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of the transport solution. Subsequently they were assayed for [3H]GABA transport at 37 °C, unless indicated otherwise. The hydrophilic methanethiosulfonate reagents used during the preincubation were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. or from Anatrace, Inc. The concentration of these reagents chosen in the different experiments was optimized according to the experimental conditions or the mutants used. For instance, in Fig. 7, different concentrations were used for the different mutants, because some are more sensitive than others.cRNA Transcription, Injection, and Oocyte Preparation—Capped run-off cRNA transcripts were made from transporter constructs in pOG1, linearized with SacII, using mMessage mMachine (Ambion). Oocytes were removed from anesthetized Xenopus laevis frogs and treated with collagenase (type 1A; Sigma number C-9891) until capillaries were absent and injected with 50 nl of undiluted cRNA the same or the next day. Oocytes were maintained at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline containing the following (in mm): NaCl 88, KCl 1, MgSO4 1, NaHCO3 2.4, CaCl2 1, Ca(NO3)2 0.3, HEPES 10, pH 7.5, with freshly added sodium pyruvic acid 2 and theophylline 0.5 and supplemented with 10000 units/liter penicillin, 10 mg/liter streptomycin, 50 mg/liter gentamicin.Oocyte Electrophysiology—Oocytes were placed in the recording chamber, penetrated with two micropipettes (backfilled with 2 m KCl, resistance varied between 0.5 and 2 megohms), and voltage clamped using a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments) and digitized using Digidata 1200A (Axon Instruments), both controlled with the pClamp6 suite (Axon Instruments). Currents were acquired with clampex6.03 at 10 kHz every 0.5 ms and low pass-filtered online. Oocytes were stepped from –135 mV to +40 mV in 25-mV increments, using –25 mV as holding potential, unless stated otherwise in the figure legends. Each potential was held clamped for 500 ms. The membrane potential was measured relative to an extracellular Ag/AgCl electrode in the recording chamber. Recording solution contained 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4.In substitution experiments, sodium ions were replaced with equimolar choline or lithium (as indicated in the figure legends), and chloride was replaced by gluconate. In Cl– substitution experiments, a 2 m KCl-agar bridge connected the recording chamber to a 2 m KCl reservoir containing the Ag/AgCl electrode. Records shown in Figs. 9, 10, 11 are typical and representative of experiments done with six to thirteen independent oocytes from four to six different batches. Analysis was performed with Clampfit 6.05. In Figs. 9, 10, 11, the acquired data were filtered offline using the substituted average method with a reduction factor of four.

To screen for those positions where introduction of a cysteine residue is tolerated in terms of activity, yet renders the transporter sensitive to sulfhydryl reagents, we have initially mutated amino acids throughout the loop with intervals ranging from two to five residues. Cysteine replacement at positions 364 and 366 results in high levels of sodium-dependent [3H]GABA uptake, when expressed in HeLa cells (Fig. 1B), and this activity is very sensitive to treatment with the membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl reagent MTSET (Fig. 2). To determine whether cysteine replacement in other positions near 364 and 366 also results in transporters retaining significant activity, which is sensitive to sulfhydryl modification, the additional mutations at positions 362, 363, and 365 were made in a second round of mutagenesis. Mutants G362C and F365C have low activity (Fig. 1B), which, however, is highly sensitive to MTSET (Fig. 2). A346C, T349C, and E370C, which have high transport activity, are less sensitive than the previous group but significantly more sensitive to MTSET than the wild-type (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.05). Increased sensitivity to MTSET is also observed with S359C (Fig. 2), which has lower activity than the wild-type (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, mutant A358C is stimulated, rather than inhibited, by treatment with MTSET (Fig. 2). Thus, of the twelve mutants that show measurable activity, nine are functionally impacted by the sulfhydryl reagent.The impact of cysteine replacement is mostly because of effects on V max rather than Km (Table I). Only in two of the mutants, A358C and Q374C, the apparent affinity decreased around 2-fold as compared with that of wild-type. In mutants T349C, A354C, A364C, and E370C, the reduced V max is significantly compensated by a decreased Km. To determine whether this reduced V max is because of reduced numbers of transporters on the plasma membrane, surface biotinylation was performed on the inactive mutants G343C and L363C and on two of the mutants that had the lowest activity, G362C and F365C (Fig. 3). HeLa cells expressing wild-type and mutant transporters were treated with the impermeant biotinylation reagent sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamide) ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate. Upon solubilization of the membrane proteins with detergent, the biotinylated proteins were isolated using streptavidin beads. After SDS-PAGE of total (unfractionated) and biotinylated proteins, followed by Western blot analysis using an affinity-purified antibody against GAT-1, the transporter bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. A diffuse band of 50–55 kDa is observed in the total and biotinylated samples of the wild-type and the mutants (Fig. 3). This diffuse band represents the GAT-1 transporter, because it is absent in the biotinylated sample of cells transfected with the vector pBluescript SK(–) alone. The sharp bands observed in the total sample of cells transfected with the vector alone are nonspecific bands, documented previously (27Bennett E.R. Su H. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34106-34113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The ratio of the intensities of the specific bands from biotinylated and total samples (after subtraction of the corresponding region from the lanes containing the samples of cells expressing the vector alone) of the mutants G343C, G362C, L363C, and F365C is similar to that of the wild-type and A346C. This latter mutant has almost the same activity as the wild-type (Fig. 1B). The values are 1.17 ± 0.41, 1.18 ± 0.14, 1.25 ± 0.2, and 1.13 ± 0.19 for the mutants, respectively, and 1.42 ± 0.17 and 1.35 ± 0.17 for wild-type and A346C (n = 4; one-way ANOVA, p < 0.05). The ratios are larger than one, because only a small fraction of the total samples was run on the gel (see legend to Fig. 3). The average surface expression of the mutants as percent of that of the wild-type are 101.0 ± 42.8, 47.8 ± 30.3, 82.6 ± 31.6, 82.6 ± 31.5, and 73.9 ± 37.3 for A346C, G343C, G362C, L363C, and F365C, respectively (n = 4). According to statistical analysis using a one-way ANOVA with a post hoc Dunnett multiple comparison test of significance, the surface expression of the mutants is not significantly different from that of the wild-type (p < 0.05). Thus, even though there is a large variation experiment to experiment in surface changes, our overall impression is that not only with the inactive mutants G343C and L363C, but also with mutants G362C and F365C, which have less than 10% of the transport activity of the wild-type (Fig. 1B), these differences in transport cannot be attributed to surface changes.Table IKinetic parameters for GABA transport of mutant transporters with cysteine replacements in the fourth extracellular loopKmVmaxμ m% wild-typeWild-type3.8 ± 0.71001341C2.8 ± 0.856.5 ± 3.6A346C3.3 ± 0.872.0 ± 26.1T349C1.4 ± 0.125.3 ± 3.6A354C2.2 ± 0.336.1 ± 12.9A358C7.3 ± 2.474.3 ± 1.3S359C3.7 ± 0.316.0 ± 1.5G362C3.5 ± 0.57.3 ± 2.3A364C1.8 ± 0.640.7 ± 14.1F365C2.5 ± 0.44.9 ± 1.4L366C3.1 ± 0.452.0 ± 16.7E370C1.8 ± 0.135.5 ± 7.4Q374C7.5 ± 1.3151.9 ± 42.7 Open table in a new tab Because A364C has the highest transport activity (Fig. 1B) of the mutants potently inhibited by MTSET (Fig. 2), we have focused on the characterization of this inhibition in the presence and absence of the substrates of the transporter. Cysteine 74 has been found to be the major determinant for MTSET sensitivity in GAT-1 (19Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that the introduction of a cysteine in position 364 causes an increased accessibility of the endogenous cysteine at position 74, mutation A364C has been subcloned into the background where this cysteine is replaced by an alanine, and we have done the same with L366C. The sensitivity of the double mutants A364C/C74A (Fig. 4A) and of L366C/C74A (see Fig. 7) to MTSET indicates that it is probably the introduced cysteine that is the target for modification by the sulfhydryl reagent. Moreover, mutant A364S/C74A is not inhibited by MTSET (Fig. 4A) rendering unlikely the possibility that the introduction of a cysteine residue at position 364 exposes a previously inaccessible endogenous cysteine residue.Fig. 4Effect of sodium, chloride, and MTSET concentration on the inhibition of transport of A364C/C74A.

Cells expressing the double mutant have been treated by 0.15 mm MTSET, so that an inhibition of around 65% is achieved. Analysis of the initial rate of transport as a function of the GABA concentration shows that the Km for GABA is very little changed by the treatment: 1.7 ± 0.1 μm (n = 3) without and 1.6 ± 0.2 μm (n = 3) after treatment with the sulfhydryl reagent. On the other hand the value of V max is reduced from 8.5 ± 0.8 to 2.5 ± 0.9 pmol/min/well (n = 3). In the batch of HeLa cells used in these ex"
https://openalex.org/W2038933967,"Eukaryotic proteins containing a CAAX (A is aliphatic amino acid) C-terminal tetrapeptide sequence generally undergo a lipid modification, the addition of a prenyl group. Proteins that are modified by prenylation, such as Ras GTPases, can be subsequently modified by a proteolytic event that removes a C-terminal tripeptide (AAX). Two distinct proteases have been identified that are involved in the CAAX proteolytic step, FACE-1/Ste24 and FACE-2/Rce1. These proteases have different enzymatic properties, substrate specificities, and biological functions. However, a proposal has been made that plants lack a FACE-2/Rce1-type protease. Here, we describe the isolation of a cDNA from Arabidopsis thaliana that encodes a 311-aa protein with characteristics that are similar to the FACE-2/Rce1 group of enzymes. Northern blot analysis demonstrates widespread expression of this gene in plant tissues. Heterologous expression of the A. thaliana cDNA in yeast restores CAAX proteolytic activity to yeast lacking native CAAX proteases. The recombinant protein produced in this system displays an in vivo substrate specificity profile distinct from AtSte24 and cleaves a farnesylated CAAX tetrapeptide in vitro. These results provide evidence for the existence of a previously unsuspected plant FACE-2/Rce1 ortholog and support the evolutionary conservation of dual CAAX proteolytic systems in eukaryotes.

This modification pathway starts with the addition of a prenyl group (farnesyl or geranylgeranyl) to the side chain of the cysteine residue. The -AAX tripeptide is proteolytically removed, and finally, the carboxyl group of the prenylated cysteine is methylated. These modifications occur to many eukaryotic proteins, including proteins of great biological and pathological relevance such as the small GTPases of the Ras superfamily, the heterotrimeric G-proteins, and certain nuclear lamins. These modifications may impart membrane binding, alter activity, and/or regulate protein-protein interactions (reviewed in Refs. 1Clarke S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 355-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 2Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar, 3Choy E. Chiu V.K.

Because of the central role of oncogenic Ras proteins in human cancer and the fact that improperly modified Ras has significantly reduced activity, the enzymes responsible for each of the steps in CAAX maturation have attracted interest as potential targets of antitumoral therapies. For example, inhibitors of the farnesyltransferase that carries out the first step of this processing cascade are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer (4Reiss Y. Goldstein J.L. Seabra M.C. Casey P.J. Brown M.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 81-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 5Cox A.D. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2002; 2: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the enzymes involved in the proteolytic and methylation steps could also provide feasible points of therapeutic intervention.Two genes encoding distinct CAAX proteases have been identified in several organisms with the first set being identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (6Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In yeast, Ste24p was identified as being required for the maturation of the prenylated mating pheromone a-factor (6Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 7Fujimura-Kamada K. Nouvet F.J. Michaelis S. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 635-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Yeast Ste24p is a metalloprotease that cleaves the farnesylated a-factor precursor after the farnesyl-cysteine residue and also at a second point toward the N terminus of the polypeptide (8Tam A. Nouvet F.J. Fujimura-Kamada K. Slunt H. Sisodia S.S. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 635-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The completely unrelated Rce1p protein was also determined to cleave after the farnesylcysteine residue of a-factor (6Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In addition, Rce1p seems to be responsible for removing the C-terminal tripeptide (AAX) from other prenylated proteins including proteins of the Ras superfamily (6Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Thus, Ste24p and Rce1p appear to have partially redundant function in cleaving yeast prenylated proteins. Moreover, the yeast enzymes have been reported to have partially overlapping substrate specificity (9Trueblood C.E. Boyartchuk V.L. Picologlou E.A. Rozema D. Poulter C.D. Rine J. Mol. Cell.

Similar to the yeast enzymes, these orthologs contain several putative transmembrane domains and are likely to be localized at the cellular endomembrane system where the yeast enzymes have been localized (14Schmidt W.K. Tam A. Fujimura-Kamada K. Michaelis S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11175-11180Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).Although Rce1p and Ste24p have partially overlapping function, the relative importance of these enzymes to cellular physiology is quite distinct. Gene disruption has demonstrated the essential role of FACE-2/Rce1 in the processing and correct subcellular localization of Ras proteins (15Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Taylor B. Ashby M. Shannon K. Casey P.J. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8383-8390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, the loss of FACE-2/Rce1p is lethal in mice. FACE-2-deficient cells are also less susceptible to Ras-mediated transformation, supporting the inhibition of this enzyme as an anti-tumoral therapy (15Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Taylor B.

By contrast, targeted disruption of FACE-1/Ste24 results in more subtle effects. Mice lacking FACE-1 are apparently normal at birth, but their growth slows after a few weeks when they begin to show accelerated aging, bone alterations, and symptoms characteristic of muscular dystrophies. These effects are apparently due to the incomplete processing of lamin A, a farnesylated component of the nuclear lamina, because the lamin A precursor accumulates in FACE-1-defficient cells and tissues (17Pendás A.M. Zhou Z. Cadiñanos J. Freije J.P. Wang J. Hultenby K. Astudillo A. Wernerson A. Rodríguez F. Tryggvason K. López-Otín C. Nat.

A. 2003; 99: 13049-13054Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar).A FACE-1/Ste24 ortholog was the first CAAX protease to be identified in plants. AtSTE24 isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana has been functionally characterized and shown to have broad substrate specificity (19Bracha K. Lavy M. Yalovsky S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29856-29864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This finding and the absence of an obvious plant Rce1p ortholog has led to the proposal that plants lack FACE-2/Rce1-like enzymes. According to this hypothesis, AtSTE24 is proposed to have evolved into a broader biological role as the only CAAX protease in these organisms (19Bracha K. Lavy M. Yalovsky S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29856-29864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that A. thaliana lacks Ras GTPases (20Vernoud V. Horton A.C. Yang Z. Nielsen E. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 2003; 131: 1191-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), which have thus far been shown to be FACE-2/Rce1-specific targets in other organisms. Here, we describe the identification of a widely expressed A. thaliana gene encoding a FACE-2-type CAAX protease. This plant enzyme can substitute for the yeast enzyme in vivo and can cleave a farnesylated peptide in vitro. Together with the recent identification of two CAAX proteases belonging to FACE-1/Ste24 and FACE-2/Rce1 types from Caenorhabditis elegans (13Cadiñanos J. Schmidt W.K. Fueyo A. Varela I. López-Otín C. Freije J.P. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 1047-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these findings support the evolutionary conservation of this proteolytic system in all eukaryotes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Restriction endonucleases and other molecular cloning reagents were purchased from Roche Applies Science. [α-32P]dCTP was from Amersham Biosciences. [3H]Farnesyl pyrophosphate was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma-Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). Double-stranded DNA probes were radiolabeled using a commercial random-priming kit from Amersham Biosciences. A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia) were provided by D. García and E. Cervantes (University of Salamanca) and cultivated under standard conditions.RNA Isolation and Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from A. thaliana seeds or tissues following the procedure described by Vicient and Delseny (21Vicient C.M. Delseny M. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 268: 412-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed with the SuperScript kit (Invitrogen) using oligo(dT) as primer in the reverse transcriptase reaction. PCR reactions were carried out in a GeneAmp 2400 PCR system from PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Cetus (Boston, MA) for 40 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 15 s), annealing (64 °C, 20 s), and extension (72 °C, 2 min). The coding sequence of AtFACE-2 was amplified with primers F2At-forward (5′-CGGAGCTTCCTCAACGATTATGG-3′) and F2At-reverse (5′-TTGGAGAAGTGTCAATTCCACAAACA-3′). Nylon filters containing 20 μg of total RNA from A. thaliana seeds and tissues were prehybridized at 42 °Cfor3hin50% formamide, 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA (1 time = 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), 10× Denhardt's solution, 2% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA and then hybridized with radiolabeled AtFACE-2 cDNAs for 20 h under the same conditions. Filters were washed with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 2 h at 50 °C and exposed to autoradiography.DNA Sequencing and Sequence Analysis—PCR products were gel-purified, treated with Klenow fragment, kinased, and subcloned in the polylinker region of pBlueScript or pcDNA3. DNA sequencing was carried out using an ABI PRISM™ 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). All of the nucleotide sequences were identified in both strands. Computer analysis of DNA and protein sequences was performed with the GCG software package of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (22Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11516) Google Scholar). Data base similarity searches were performed with the BLAST algorithm (23Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69013) Google Scholar). Multiple alignments were performed with the program ClustalX (24Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F.

Transmembrane regions were predicted with the help of the programs TopPred2 (25von Heijne G. J. Mol.

Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166-171Google Scholar).Yeast Strains and Plasmids—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Yeast were grown at 30 °C in complete (YPD) or synthetic media containing appropriate supplements (SC-) as described previously (27Michaelis S Herskowitz I. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1986; 47: 413-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Plasmid-transformed strains were created according to published methods (29Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmids used in this study are listed in Table II. The plasmids encoding tagged and untagged yeast Rce1p and Ste24p have been described previously (7Fujimura-Kamada K. Nouvet F.J. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 14Schmidt W.K. Tam A. Fujimura-Kamada K. Michaelis S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11175-11180Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Low copy yeast expression vectors (CEN) encoding epitope-tagged and untagged CAAX proteases from other organisms were generated by replacing the appropriate yeast open reading frame (ORF) with the corresponding ortholog cDNAs by PCR-directed homologous recombination (30Oldenburg K.R. Vo K.T. Michaelis S. Paddon C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 451-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Thus, the expression of Rce1p and Ste24p orthologs is under control of the native promoters for yeast RCE1 and STE24, respectively. Multi-copy plasmids (2μ) encoding the CAAX protease ORFs were also created by recombinational cloning using linearized pRS426 as the recipient vector for the ortholog-containing fragments (31Sikorski R.S. Hieter P Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the high expression vector encoding AtFACE-2 was generated by subcloning this cDNA into the polylinker of pSM703, a 2μ vector containing the constitutive phosphoglycerate kinase promoter (31Sikorski R.S. Hieter P Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Zhang Y. Nijbroek G. Sullivan M.L. McCracken A.A. Watkins S.C. Michaelis S. Brodsky J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). A STE24 disruption plasmid, pWS405, was created by replacing the entire STE24 ORF of pSM1093 with the KanMX gene by homologous recombination (8Tam A. Nouvet F.J. Fujimura-Kamada K. Slunt H. Sisodia S.S. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 635-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A PvuII and NdeI digestion fragment from the resultant plasmid containing the KanMX gene flanked by ∼800 bp of sequence homologous to the STE24 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions was transformed into SM3613 to create yWS164. Transformed cells were selected on YEPD plates containing G418 (200 μg/ml). Two plasmid-encoding CAAX variants (CTLM and CASQ) of the wild type a-factor gene (CVIA) were created by PCR-directed homologous recombination using the yeast a-factor gene encoded on pWS438. All of the plasmids constructed were analyzed by restriction digest and/or sequencing analysis to verify that the proper inserts were present.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeReferenceSM1058MAT a trp1 leu2 ura3 his4 can127Michaelis S Herskowitz I.

For both tests, cells grown in selective medium were replica-plated onto a lawn of SM1086 (halo test) or SM1068 (mating test) that was previously spread onto a rich (YPD) or minimal (SD) agar plate, respectively. Halo formation and diploid production were recorded after 24 and 48 h, respectively, of incubation at 30 °C. For the specificity study, cells were grown to saturation in 100-μl cultures in microtiter plates, washed twice with H2O, and resuspended into 10 μl of sterile H2O. For each strain examined, a portion of the resuspended cells (2 μl) was spotted onto the corresponding lawn.CAAX Proteolytic Assay—CAAX proteolytic assays were performed essentially as described previously (33Georgopapadakou N.H. Hall C.C. Lambros T. Liu W. Watkins J.D. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Farnesyltransferase that was partially purified from calf brains by ammonium sulfate precipitation (30–50%), hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and cation exchange was used to farnesylate the tetrapeptide Ac-CVIS using [3H]farnesyl pyrophosphate as donor of the prenyl group. The farnesylated peptide was purified by organic extraction, lyophilized, and dissolved in Me2SO at a final concentration of 10 μm (∼7250 Ci/mmol). Membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (34Schmidt W.K. Tam A. Michaelis S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6227-6233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: cells were resuspended in 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 200 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 (FACE buffer), and the membranes were recovered by centrifugation at 16,000 × g. CAAX proteolytic assays were performed in FACE buffer in a final volume of 100 μl for 1 h at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of 0.8 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:1). After the addition of 0.8 ml of 1 m citric acid, the organic phase containing the farnesylated peptides was collected, vacuum-dried, and analyzed by thin layer chromatography in 20 × 20-cm cellulose plates using chloroform:acetone:methanol:acetic acid (60:20:10:5) as mobile phase. After chromatography, the TLC plates were dried and exposed to Biomax x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at -80 °C for 1 week.Western Blot—Yeast membrane extracts (40 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes following standard procedures. The 12CA5 anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Equal loading of the different samples was assessed by reversible staining of the membranes with Ponceau S. Detection of the immunoreactive bands was carried out with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and the PicoSignal chemiluminescent reagent from Pierce.RESULTSIdentification and Characterization of the A. thaliana AtFACE-2 Gene—Both FACE-1/Ste24 and FACE-2/Rce1 CAAX proteases have been described in yeasts, mammals, and nematodes (6Boyartchuk V.L.

However, it has been recently proposed that the plant FACE-1-type enzyme might have evolved to acquire broader substrate specificity and function as the only CAAX protease (19Bracha K. Lavy M. Yalovsky S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29856-29864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we performed a TBLASTN search of the A. thaliana genomic databases using the human FACE-2 amino acid sequence as query. This approach revealed the presence of a putative gene in A. thaliana chromosome 2 with significant similarity to the human sequence. Furthermore, two expressed sequence tags corresponding to this genomic region were identified (AV557607 and AU231387), which encoded partial amino acid sequences similar to the C-terminal portion of FACE-2-type proteases. For one of these expressed sequence tags (AU331387), the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the 5′ end of the cDNA clone from which it had been derived was also available in the data base (GenBank™ accession AU240018), allowing us to design oligonucleotides corresponding to both ends of the cDNA. These oligonucleotides were used in a reverse transcriptase-PCR experiment using total RNA from A. thaliana seeds as template, after which we obtained a 966-bp cDNA fragment containing the coding sequence for a 311-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 34,548 Da. This protein, which we have tentatively called AtFACE-2, displays a significant degree of sequence similarity to previously described enzymes of the FACE-2/Rce1 family (Fig. 1). The closest homolog of AtFACE-2 is the insect enzyme (45% similarity and 27% identity), whereas a hypothetical CAAX protease from Candida albicans is the most distantly related ortholog (33% similarity and 14% identity). As shown in Fig. 1, 21 amino acid residues are conserved across all of the FACE-2/Rce1 sequences. These invariably conserved positions include several residues previously reported to be required for the enzymatic activity of S. cerevisiae Rce1p (Glu-164, His-198, His-251, and Cys-254 in the Arabidopsis sequence) (35Dolence J.M. Steward L.E. Dolence E.K. Wong D.H. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4096-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). 18 of the 21 invariably conserved residues are located in a region corresponding roughly to the third quarter of the polypeptide chain (residues 155–260 in AtFACE-2), suggesting that this part of the protein could be the most directly involved in its function.Computer analysis of the amino acid sequence predicted several putative transmembrane helices (Fig. 2), suggesting that the plant enzyme is localized to membranes as has been"
https://openalex.org/W2060371769,"MENT is a developmentally regulated heterochromatin-associated protein that condenses chromatin in terminally differentiated avian blood cells. Its homology to the serpin protein family suggests that the conserved serpin reactive center loop (RCL) and the unique M-loop are important for its function. To examine the role of these domains, we studied the interaction of wild-type and mutant MENT with naked DNA and biochemically defined nucleosome arrays reconstituted from 12-mer repeats containing nucleosome positioning sequences. Wild-type MENT folded the naked DNA duplexes into closely juxtaposed parallel structures (“tramlines”). Deletion of the M-loop, but not inactivation of the RCL, prevented tramline formation and the cooperative interaction of MENT with DNA. Reconstitution of wild-type MENT with nucleosome arrays caused their tight folding and self-association. M-loop deletion inhibited nucleosome array folding, whereas the inactive RCL mutant was competent to fold the nucleosome arrays, but had a significantly impaired ability to cause their self-association. Bifunctional chemical cross-linking of MENT revealed oligomerization of wild-type MENT in the presence of chromatin and DNA. This oligomerization was severely reduced in the RCL mutant. We propose that the mechanism of MENT-induced heterochromatin formation involves two independent events: bringing together nucleosome linkers within a chromatin fiber and formation of protein bridges between chromatin fibers. Ordered binding of MENT to linker DNA via its unique M-loop domain promotes the folding of chromatin, whereas bridging of chromatin fibers is facilitated by MENT oligomerization mediated by the RCL.

In eukaryotic chromatin, DNA is coiled around histone octamers to form nucleosome arrays, which are further packed into compact higher order structures (for review, see Refs. 1Woodcock C.L. Dimitrov S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 2Horn P.J. Peterson C.L.

Leuba S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Two major types of chromatin are distinguished by their packing density: open, less compact euchromatin and highly condensed heterochromatin (5Hennig W. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1999; 108: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 6Richards E.J. Elgin S.C. Cell. 2002; 108: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Heterochromatin contains predominantly repressed genes and spreads to the bulk of nuclear chromatin during terminal cell differentiation when most of the genome becomes inactive (7Frenster J.H. Busch H. The Cell Nucleus. Vol. 1. Academic Press, New York1974: 565-581Crossref Google Scholar, 8Francastel C. Schubeler D. Martin D.I. Groudine M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Heterochromatin spreading in terminally differentiated cells is associated with profound remodeling of higher order chromatin structure. Linker DNA at the entry/exit site of the nucleosome becomes more condensed, and extensive lateral interactions form between chromatin fibers (reviewed in Ref. 9Grigoryev S.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Such changes are driven by developmentally regulated factors. Surprisingly, the expression of major non-histone proteins that promote heterochromatin-specific repression in proliferating cells, such as Ikaros and heterochromatin protein 1, declines in terminally differentiated cells (10Brown K.E. Baxter J. Graf D. Merkenschlager M. Fisher A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 207-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 11Istomina N.E. Shushanov S.S. Springhetti E.M.

Biol. 2003; 23: 6455-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and thus cannot account for heterochromatin spreading. As developing avian blood cells enter the final maturation stage and RNA and protein synthesis declines, few proteins capable of carrying out chromatin condensation are up-regulated. Nucleated erythrocytes in vertebrates (other than mammals) accumulate histone H5, an erythrocyte-specific member of the histone H1 family that is involved in modifying higher order chromatin structure (12Weintraub H. Cell. 1984; 38: 17-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 13Zlatanova J. van Holde K. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 889-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In other blood cells such as lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear granulocytes, the histone types and levels are not changed, suggesting that other factor(s) must participate in chromatin condensation in these types of cells. The first identified and best characterized non-histone chromatin-condensing protein is MENT (myeloid and erythroid nuclear termination stage-specific protein). This abundant nuclear protein accumulates in terminally differentiating chicken blood cells, binds to heterochromatin, and promotes its condensation during terminal cell differentiation (14Grigoryev S.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3082-3089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). MENT belongs to a structurally diverse but functionally related group of proteins, including Sir3p, Tup1p, and MeCP2, that assemble tight higher order chromatin structures in repressed chromatin (3Hansen J.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 361-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 9Grigoryev S.A. Biochem.

The mechanism(s) of chromatin compaction by these proteins and the structural features that mediate chromatin remodeling remain unknown. MENT is a member of the serpin (serine protease inhibitor) family and contains a conserved inhibitory serpin reactive center loop (RCL) 1The abbreviations used are: RCL, reactive center loop; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; DNP, deoxynucleoprotein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; EDAC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide HCl; kbp, kilobase pairs.1The abbreviations used are: RCL, reactive center loop; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; DNP, deoxynucleoprotein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; EDAC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide HCl; kbp, kilobase pairs. (17Grigoryev S.A. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5626-5636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Previous studies of MENT expressed in NIH/3T3 cells have shown that the RCL affects MENT interactions with chromatin in vivo (18Irving J.A. Shushanov S.S. Pike R.N. Popova E.Y. Bromme D. Coetzer T.H. Bottomley S.P. Boulynko I.A. Grigoryev S.A. Whisstock J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13192-13201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). MENT sequencing also reveals a putative chromatin-binding domain (the M-loop) that contains an AT-hook DNA-binding motif that is absent in other serpins (17Grigoryev S.A. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5626-5636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The goal of this work was to understand how chromatin structure is modified by MENT and specifically to determine the individual roles of the M-loop and RCL of MENT in chromatin folding and self-association. Here, we show that these two domains fulfill distinct functions in chromatin condensation. The M-loop mediates side-by-side juxtaposition of naked DNA and is necessary for tight folding of chromatin via its interaction with linker DNA. The RCL is not required for DNA folding, but is necessary for chromatin self-association and MENT oligomerization. Our findings dissect, for the first time, chromatin condensation into two independent structural transitions caused by a single factor (MENT): compaction of individual chromatin fibers and formation of protein bridges that interconnect distinct nucleosome arrays. MENT Expression and Isolation—Purification of recombinant histidine-tagged MENT was performed as described (18Irving J.A. Shushanov S.S. Pike R.N. Popova E.Y. Bromme D. Coetzer T.H. Bottomley S.P.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13192-13201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) with modifications that included using the BPER reagent (Pierce) for bacterial cell lysis. Briefly, MENT and its mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pET-15b constructs. Expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at a cell density of A 600 = 0.6, and cells were harvested 2.5 h postinduction by centrifugation. Frozen cell pellets were lysed using BPER according to the manufacturer's instructions, with the exception of the addition of 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 25 μg/ml DNase I (Worthington) to the BPER reagent before cell lysis. Lysate was purified on HisTrap affinity columns (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. MENT-containing fractions were further purified on HiTrap SP cation-exchange columns using an AKTA FPLC unit (Amersham Biosciences). MENT-containing fractions were dialyzed into 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 50 mm NaCl and were stored at +4 °C for use over a period of 30 days. Nucleosome Reconstitution—Nucleosome 12-mer arrays were reconstituted from DNA of the sea urchin 5 S rRNA gene containing 207x12 nucleosome positioning sequences (19Simpson R.T. Thoma F. Brubaker J.M. Cell. 1985; 42: 799-808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and core histones as described (20Meersseman G. Pennings S. Bradbury E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Core histones and DNA were mixed on ice to a final concentration of 0.05 mg/ml histones, 1.9 A 260 units of DNA, and 2 m NaCl and dialyzed in Slide-A-Lyzer units (M r 3500 cutoff, Pierce) stepwise into reconstitution buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 2, 1.5, or 0.75 m NaCl for 3 h at 4 °C, followed by dialysis into reconstitution buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl for 12 h and finally into buffer containing 5 mm NaCl for 6 h. Deoxynucleoprotein (DNP) Electrophoresis—Native agarose gel electrophoresis of protein-DNA complexes was performed as described (15Grigoryev S.A. Woodcock C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3082-3089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, MENT was mixed with native chicken nucleosome arrays, naked DNA (207x12 5 S nucleosome positioning sequence), or nucleosome array reconstitutes and incubated for 30 min on ice in 10-μl reactions containing 0.6 A 260 units of chromatin, 13 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 37 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 0.4–2.5 μm MENT. Samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were loaded directly onto 1% type IV agarose gels (Sigma) in 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0) and 0.2 mm EDTA and resolved at 80 V for 90 min. Gels were stained in ethidium bromide following electrophoresis. Reaction precipitates were dissolved in 1% SDS and loaded onto 1% type I agarose gel containing TAE (0.04 m Tris-acetate, pH = 7.8; 0.02 m Na-acetate; 2 mm EDTA) and ethidium bromide. All gels were visualized and digitized using EagleEye software. Precipitates were quantified using OptiQuant software to determine the percentage of total chromatin or DNA precipitated in the reaction. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—The DNA probe used in EMSAs was an 88-bp PCR product of the second intron of the chicken βA-globin gene, and the pCAβG1 plasmid (21Wood W.I. Felsenfeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7730-7736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a template. The primers used were 5′-GTG AGA AAG GAA TGA AGG GGA TGG and 5′-GCC ACC TCC TCA CTG CCT TCC. The product was purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit. DNA fragments were 5′-end-labeled with T4 kinase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Labeled DNA was purified using a Bio-Spin P-30 column (Bio-Rad), followed by ethanol precipitation. For EMSA (22Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1684) Google Scholar), 50-μl reactions containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, <1 nm labeled DNA, and 0–50 nm MENT were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were loaded directly onto 6% acrylamide gels (35:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in 25 m HEPES (pH 7.5) and 0.125 mm EDTA that had been prerun for 30 min at 20 mA. Electrophoresis was performed at 20 mA/gel for 30 min. Gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid and 10% methanol for 30 min, dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry was performed using OptiQuant software and by measuring the disappearance of unbound DNA probe. Electron Microscopy—For standard transmission electron microscopy of naked DNA and protein-DNA complexes (A 260 = 1.0), samples identical to those taken for DNP electrophoresis (see above) were fixed by the addition of 0.1% glutaraldehyde for at least 16 h at +2 °C. Fixed samples were applied to glow discharged thin carbon films and stained with ethanolic phosphotungstic acid (positive staining) or aqueous uranyl acetate (negative staining) as described (23Woodcock C.L. Horowitz R.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1998; 53: 167-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For negative staining, fixed samples on carbon films were washed with double-distilled water and then negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate and air-dried. For positive staining, samples were rinsed in 0.3% PhotoFlo 100 in distilled water that had been brought to pH 9.0 with sodium borate buffer and air-dried. Grids were then stained by immersion for 30 s in 1% sodium phosphotungstate in 75% ethanol, rinsed briefly in 95% ethanol, dehydrated in 100% ethanol, and air-dried (23Woodcock C.L. Horowitz R.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1998; 53: 167-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For electron microscopy of reconstituted nucleosome arrays contrasted by platinum shadowing, samples (A 260 = 1–1.5) in 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 25 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA were fixed by the addition of 0.1% glutaraldehyde for 4 h at +2 °C, and the unreacted glutaraldehyde was removed by dialysis against 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 25 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Samples were brought to 75% glycerol and then sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica as described (24Tyler J.M. Branton D. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1980; 71: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The mica was dried under high vacuum in a turbo-pumped evaporator (BA080, Baltec Inc., Hudson, NH) and, while under vacuum, shadowed with platinum at an angle of 6° and then coated with a thin layer of carbon. To provide both an accurate value for the size of the particles and also a view of the complete shape, the sample was kept stationary for the first one-fourth of the platinum evaporation procedure and then rotated for the remaining three-fourths. Samples were examined in a Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope (FEI Co., Hillsboro, OR) operated at 100 kV, and images were recorded on a slow-scan CCD camera (TVIPS GmbH, Gauting, Germany). Most shadowed preparations were examined using tilted beam dark-field optics. 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide HCl (EDAC) Cross-linking—Native soluble chicken chromatin and linker histone-depleted chromatin samples were isolated as described (15Grigoryev S.A. Woodcock C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3082-3089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). MENT was reassociated with the isolated chromatin in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 40 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.6 A 260 units of chromatin, and 0.9 μm MENT for 30 min at room temperature. EDAC (Pierce) was added to a final concentration of 30 mm, and the samples were incubated 2 h. β-Mercaptoethanol was added to a final concentration of 50 mm, and the samples were incubated for an additional 15 min. SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and the samples were boiled for 2 min. Samples were then separated on gradient SDS-10–18% acrylamide gels (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in 192 mm glycine and 25 mm Tris for 1 h at 100 V. Western blotting was performed with anti-MENT antibodies as described (15Grigoryev S.A. Woodcock C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3082-3089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The M-loop Domain of MENT Is Necessary for Cooperative Binding of MENT to DNA—A homology model of MENT reveals the presence of two domains that protrude from the main body of the protein; one is the serpin-like RCL, and the other is an AT-hook-containing domain, designated the M-loop (17Grigoryev S.A. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5626-5636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To examine the role of these two loops in the ability of MENT to bind to and/or bridge DNA, we constructed vectors expressing wild-type MENT (MENTWT) and three mutant proteins (Fig. 1A). In the first, we completely replaced the RCL sequence (residues 356–372 in MENT) with the one from the inactive serpin ovalbumin (MENTov); in the second, we deleted residues 61–88 to obtain the M-loop deletion (MENTMLoop–); and in the third, we made a single point mutation in the hinge region of the RCL (MENTT→R). The two RCL mutations, MENTov and MENTT→R, result in the inability of MENT to inhibit target protease. All three mutations have been shown to affect MENT interactions with nuclear chromatin after transfection into cultured cells (18Irving J.A. Shushanov S.S. Pike R.N. Popova E.Y. Bromme D. Coetzer T.H. Bottomley S.P. Boulynko I.A. Grigoryev S.A. Whisstock J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13192-13201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We expressed the recombinant, N-terminally histidine-tagged wild-type and mutant MENT proteins in E. coli and isolated the proteins by histidine trap affinity and ion-exchange chromatography (18Irving J.A. Shushanov S.S. Pike R.N. Popova E.Y. Bromme D. Coetzer T.H. Bottomley S.P. Boulynko I.A. Grigoryev S.A. Whisstock J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13192-13201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Expressed proteins were shown by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight to have the predicted molecular masses. Recombinant wild-type MENT behaved similarly to native MENT in DNP-agarose gel shift assays (15Grigoryev S.A. Woodcock C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3082-3089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and protease inhibition assays (18Irving J.A. Shushanov S.S. Pike R.N. Popova E.Y. Bromme D. Coetzer T.H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13192-13201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), indicating that neither the histidine tag nor the lack of eukaryotic post-translational modifications interfere with normal MENT function. The affinity of MENT for short naked DNA (under conditions of a vast excess of the protein over DNA) was assessed by EMSA (22Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1684) Google Scholar). We typically used an 88-bp DNA fragment isolated from a portion of the chicken βA-globin gene, which has an intermediate level of bound MENT in situ as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation with anti-MENT antibodies (11Istomina N.E. Shushanov S.S. Springhetti E.M. Karpov V.L. Krasheninnikov I.A. Stevens K. Zaret K.S. Singh P.B. Grigoryev S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6455-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Other sequences from the chicken genome with either lower or higher levels of MENT in situ did not differ in their affinity for MENT in vitro as determined by EMSA (data not shown), suggesting that MENT does not have a DNA sequence preference in vitro. 32P-End-labeled DNA was titrated with MENTWT, MENTMLoop–, or MENTT→R. MENT-DNA complexes were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide gels (data not shown), and the fraction of DNA bound was determined by the disappearance of unbound DNA (Fig. 1B). The unbound DNA fraction (V) versus MENT concentration was plotted in Hill coordinates (Fig. 1, C–E) to reveal the degree of cooperativity in protein-DNA interactions (26Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1993: 369-370Google Scholar, 27van Holde K.E. Johnson W.C. Ho P.S. Principles of Physical Biochemistry. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ1998: 613-621Google Scholar). Although MENTWT and both mutants have similar Kd values of ∼2 nm (Fig. 1B), there was a striking difference in the binding cooperativity seen in M-loop-deleted MENT. Both MENTWT and MENTT→R exhibited strong positive cooperativity (Hill coefficients of 1.32 and 1.79, respectively). MENTMLoop– exhibited strong negative cooperativity, with a Hill coefficient of 0.60. This indicates that the M-loop of MENT, but not its RCL, is necessary for cooperative binding of MENT to DNA. Interactions of wild-type MENT and its mutants with longer DNA (2.5 kilobase pairs (kbp)) were examined by agarose gel shift assays (15Grigoryev S.A. Woodcock C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3082-3089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) under conditions in which the range of MENT concentrations was close to that of DNA (1–7 molecules/100 bp). Under these stoichiometric binding conditions, the number of MENT molecules bound per DNA and the ability of MENT to fold DNA into ordered structures could be monitored. As with short DNA, both the wild-type and mutant MENT proteins bound DNA with similar affinity as determined by the disappearance of unbound DNA (Fig. 1G) and could accommodate up to 2 MENT molecules/100 bp of DNA without precipitation (Fig. 1F). Association of MENTWT and MENTov with long DNA resulted in the formation of distinct complexes with significantly lower mobility compared with free DNA upon DNP-agarose electrophoresis. These results are similar to those obtained with MeCP2, where the protein was shown to form slowly migrating complexes of condensed DNA in a similar assay (16Georgel P.T. Horowitz-Scherer R.A. Adkins N. Woodcock C.L. Wade P.A. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32181-32188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In our experiments, MENTov was significantly more efficient in the formation of the retarded complexes compared with MENTWT (Fig. 1G, compare lanes 4–6 and 11–14), apparently due to a stronger self-association of DNA complexes with MENTWT, which become insoluble. This is consistent with the significant difference in DNA self-association (as measured by DNA precipitation) between MENTWT and MENTov shown in Fig. 1F, where MENTWT was about twice as effective as MENTov in causing DNA self-association at >2 MENT molecules/100 bp of DNA. MENTMLoop– induced only a small reduction in electrophoretic mobility and a smearing of the DNP bands resulting from a heterogeneous population of nucleoprotein complexes (Fig. 1G, lanes 15–19). This confirms our previous conclusion that loss of the M-loop greatly decreases the cooperativity of MENT interaction with DNA, resulting in binding without a large concomitant change in DNA conformation. The M-loop Mediates DNA Condensation into “Tramline” Structures—The structural features of MENT-DNA complexes formed in our DNP experiments were visualized by transmission electron microscopy. Complexes of MENTWT and MENTov with 1.1 kbp of DNA (3 molecules/100 bp) appeared as thick structures (Fig. 2, E–G and K) that were never seen in samples lacking MENT (Fig. 2A). We attribute the thick complexes to MENT molecules bound to DNA. At lower MENT/DNA ratios (1 molecule/100 bp), the thick complexes occupied only a segment of the DNA strand, whereas the rest of the strand maintained its initial configuration (Fig. 2, B–D). The coexistence of fully covered and fully free patches of DNA is in excellent agreement with the positive cooperativity of MENT-DNA interactions identified in EMSAs. When we compared the length of the thick complexes with the length of the starting DNA (1.1 kbp = 375 nm), we observed that the DNA molecules containing thick patches were shorter than the starting protein-free DNA. Remarkably, the double length of a thick segment plus the length of an open segment within one particle was close to the length of a single open DNA molecule. At the higher MENT/DNA ratios (3 molecules/100 bp) at which the MENTWT-DNA complexes produce prominent supershifted bands on agarose gels (Fig. 1G, lane 4), we observed fully saturated thick MENT-DNA structures (Fig. 2, E and F). The lengths of such structures measured approximately one-half of the free DNA length, consistent with the folding of DNA in half by MENT. We also saw even thicker complexes, obviously containing more than two strands of DNA and originating from extensive self-association of DNA strands (Fig. 2G). These complexes show that DNA folding by MENT is not limited to two closely juxtaposed duplexes. We suggest that, within the thick segments, the DNA is folded back on itself by MENT, forming parallel side-by-side structures. Similar structures have been previously observed with complexes between DNA and the globular region of histone H5 or MeCP2 and are known as DNA tramlines (16Georgel P.T. Horowitz-Scherer R.A. Adkins N. Woodcock C.L. Wade P.A. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32181-32188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 28Thomas J.O. Rees C. Finch J.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Indeed, when we performed negative staining of MENT-DNA complexes with uranyl acetate, we observed closely juxtaposed DNA duplexes, confirming the formation of tramlines by MENT (Fig. 2, H–J). We also used electron microscopy to examine the protein-DNA complexes formed by two mutant MENT variants. MENTov formed DNA tramlines that were nearly identical to the ones obtained with MENTWT (Fig. 2K); however, MENTov did not bridge multiple tramlines together, as seen with MENTWT. This is consistent with the lower tendency of MENTov to precipitate chromatin at high protein/DNA ratios (Fig. 1F). With MENTMLoop–, we observed only irregular protein-DNA complexes, strikingly different from those seen with MENTWT and the inactive RCL mutant (Fig. 2L). Thus, we conclude that the M-loop, but not the RCL domain, is necessary for cooperative binding of MENT to DNA and for folding DNA molecules together in an ordered fashion, resulting in the parallel tramline structures. The M-loop Is Necessary for Folding of Linker DNA in Chromatin—MENT functions in a chromatin context in vivo. To investigate the role of the RCL and M-loop domains in chromatin remodeling by MENT, we reconstituted chicken core histones with 207x12 sea urchin 5 S DNA repeats to obtain “core arrays,” defined nucleosome arrays with positioned histone cores (19Simpson R.T.

https://openalex.org/W2083665058,"Thrombin is a potent mitogen for vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). To understand its mitogenic signaling events, we have studied the role of calcium-independent phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (iPLA<sub>2</sub>). Without affecting its levels, thrombin increased iPLA<sub>2</sub> activity in a time-dependent manner in VSMC. Thrombin also induced arachidonic acid release and DNA synthesis by about 2-fold as compared with control. Down-regulation of iPLA<sub>2</sub> activity by its specific inhibitor, bromoenol lactone, or its expression by antisense oligonucleotides, significantly reduced thrombin-induced arachidonic acid release and DNA synthesis in VSMC. To learn the mechanism of thrombin-stimulated iPLA<sub>2</sub> activity, we next tested the role of p38 MAPK. Thrombin stimulated p38 MAPK phosphorylation and activity in a time-dependent manner in VSMC. Inhibition of p38 MAPK activity by SB203580 and SB202190 resulted in decreased iPLA<sub>2</sub> activity, arachidonic acid release, and DNA synthesis induced by thrombin in VSMC. Together, these results for the first time demonstrate that iPLA<sub>2</sub> plays a role in thrombin-induced arachidonic acid release and growth in VSMC and that these responses are mediated by p38 MAPK."
https://openalex.org/W2044485209,"Activation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor by EGF, its ligand, results in receptor internalization and down-regulation, which requires receptor kinase activity, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination. In contrast, we have found here in human HaCaT keratinocytes that exposure to UVA induces EGF receptor internalization and down-regulation without receptor phosphorylation and ubiquitination. The presence of the receptor kinase activity inhibitor AG1478 increased UVA-induced receptor down-regulation, whereas it inhibited EGF-induced receptor down-regulation. These observations demonstrate that, in contrast to EGF, receptor kinase activity is not required for receptor down-regulation by UVA. Concurrent with receptor down-regulation, caspases were activated by UVA exposure. The presence of caspase inhibitors blocked receptor down-regulation in a pattern similar to poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase cleavage. Much more receptor down-regulation was observed after UVA exposure in apoptotic detached cells in which caspase is activated completely. These results indicate that UVA-induced receptor down-regulation is dependent on caspase activation. Similar to UVA, both UVB and UVC induced receptor down-regulation, in which receptor kinase activity is not required, whereas caspase activation is involved. Inhibition of EGF receptor down-regulation increased receptor activation and activation of its downstream survival signaling ERK and AKT after UVA exposure. Preventing the activation of each of these pathways enhanced apoptosis induced by UVA. These findings suggest that EGF receptor down-regulation by UVA may play an important role in the execution of the cell suicide program by attenuating its anti-apoptotic function and thereby preventing cell transformation and tumorigenesis in vivo.

The ultraviolet portion of solar radiation is divided into UVC (200-280 nm), UVB (280-315 nm), and UVA (315-400 nm). UVC is absorbed completely by the stratospheric ozone layer and thus does not reach the surface of the earth. Although some UVB does reach the surface of the earth, most of it is absorbed by the ozone layer, and the UVB portion of UV in sunlight is small. The risk of UVB-induced acute and chronic damage, mainly mediated by DNA damage like UVC, can be minimized by avoiding direct exposure during midday hours, wearing protective hat/clothes, and using sunscreens (1Gasparro F.P.

The oncogenic action of EGFR correlates with its overexpression or deregulated activation at the plasma membrane. Removal of activated receptor molecules from the cell surface by sorting for degradation in lysosomes is expected to inhibit their oncogenic potential and maintain normal cell development. Binding of growth factors to RTKs promotes receptor dimerization and subsequent activation, which enhances autophosphorylation of RTKs, phosphorylation of numerous cellular proteins, and recruitment of adaptor molecules, which initiate signaling cascades, including receptor down-regulation (14Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Wasteson A. Nature. 1979; 282: 419-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Mechanisms of receptor down-regulation have been best studied for RTKs, and especially EGFR. Interaction of EGFR with the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl leads to c-Cbl phosphorylation (12Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), which results in the activation of the ubiquitin ligase activity of c-Cbl. This promotes the recruitment of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH7 (13Yokouchi M. Kondo T. Houghton A. Bartkiewicz M. Horne W.C. Zhang H. Yoshimura A. Baron R. J. Biol.

EGFR degradation controls the strength and duration of RTK-induced signals and is critical for preventing EGFR hyperactivation, commonly associated with tumorigenesis. In this study we have found that in HaCaT cells, UVA exposure caused EGFR down-regulation without phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination. In contrast, we found that EGFR down-regulation by UVA is dependent on caspase activation and plays an important role in apoptosis after UVA exposure. Cell Culture—The spontaneously immortalized human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT (17Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J.

Fusenig (German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany), was maintained in monolayer culture in 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 31 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. For experiments, HaCaT keratinocytes were seeded in plastic Petri dishes (100 mm) and allowed to attach for 12 h. Prior to UVA treatment, subconfluent cells were given fresh DMEM containing 1% FBS and incubated overnight. For EGF experiments, cells were incubated with EGF (100 ng/ml) (Sigma) in serum-free DMEM at 37 °C. UVA Treatment—The medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with sterile PBS (PBS-CMF, calcium/magnesium-free). After the addition of sterile PBS, the cells were irradiated with fluorescent lamps (Houvalite F20T12BL-HO PUVA, National Biological Corp., Twinsburg, OH) with the dish lid on. The UVA dose was monitored with a Goldilux UV meter equipped with a UVA detector (Oriel Instruments, Stratford, CT). Control samples were kept in the dark under the same conditions. After treatment, fresh medium containing 1% FBS was added after exposure, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C. At predetermined time points, attached and floating cells were harvested and subjected to analysis. In selected experiments, cells were preincubated with inhibitors at 37 °C prior to irradiation. Inhibitors used are as follows: AG1478 and PP2 from Calbiochem; MG132 (N-Cbz-Leu-Leu-Leu-al), cycloheximide (CHX), wortmannin, and caspase inhibitors (DEVD, IETD, and LEHD) from Sigma; PD98059 from Promega (Madison, WI); bafilomycin A1 and lactacystin from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (18Bao J. Alroy I. Waterman H. Schejter E.D. Brodie C. Gruenberg J. Yarden Y. J. Biol.

After treatment, cells were extracted in solubilization buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Igepal (Sigma), protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and proteins in the lysate supernatants were immunoprecipitated by overnight incubation with the indicated antibodies at 4 °C, followed by protein G (Sigma) precipitation for 1.5 h. Precipitating antibodies used are as follows: anti-EGFR clone R-1 and anti-c-Cbl clone c-15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with HNTG buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol and were detected by immunoblotting. Western Blotting—After treatments, cells were harvested and lysed with M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Total cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and protein concentrations were determined by using the BCA assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were subjected to electrophoresis on Nu-PAGE® pre-cast gels (4-12%) (NOVEX, San Diego, CA), followed by electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in TBST (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) followed by incubation with primary antibody and secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Proteins were visualized using SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Blotting antibodies used are as follows: anti-phosphotyrosine PY20 antibody (kindly provided by Dr. S.-J. Wei, NIEHS, National Institutes of Health); anti-EGFR 1005 recognizing the C terminus of EGFR, c-Cbl C-15, caspase-3, PARP, phospho-ERK, phospho-AKT (Ser-473), and Ub antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-β-actin antibody from Sigma; and anti-EGFR (Ab-12 and Ab-14) antibodies recognizing the C/N termini and N terminus of EGFR from Neomarkers (Fremont, CA). Confocal Microscopy—HaCaT cells were plated on coverslips. After treatment, cells were washed with cold PBS and then fixed with 4% formaldehyde containing 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS followed by permeabilization with 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were blocked with 0.5% gelatin and 5% goat serum in PBS for 30 min, and then the coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies used were anti-EGFR 528 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-EGFR 1005 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-EEA1 (BD Biosciences), and anti-CD63 (BD Biosciences). Secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for the detection of EEA1, CD63, and EGFR. Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using the ProLong® Antifade kit (Molecular Probes). Confocal microscopy at ×100 was carried out by using a Zeiss 410 confocal microscope. DNA Fragmentation—The pattern of DNA cleavage was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis as described previously (10He Y.Y. Huang J.L. Ramirez D.C. Chignell C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8058-8064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, after cell pellets were lysed on ice at 4 °C overnight, cell lysates were incubated with RNase A (100 μg/ml) and then with proteinase K followed by extraction with phenol/chloroform/isopropyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v). After precipitation with ethanol, DNA samples were separated by horizontal electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light. UVA and EGF Induce EGFR Down-regulation in HaCaT Cells—To determine the UVA effect on EGFR, HaCaT cells were irradiated with 24 J/cm2 UVA and then incubated for different times after exposure. Western blotting showed that there was a marked down-regulation of EGFR at 3 h after UVA exposure (Fig. 1A). Caspase-3 was activated in a similar pattern, as was the cleavage of PARP, the substrate for the active form of caspase-3. However, phosphorylated EGFR increased slightly for 6 and 9 h. There was no significant increase in EGFR phosphorylation at 1 h. Additionally UVA-induced EGFR degradation was also seen in A431 cells and HeLa cells (data not shown). It is known that EGF binding to EGFR induces receptor down-regulation (14Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Wasteson A. Nature. 1979; 282: 419-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To investigate the difference in EGFR down-regulation between UVA and EGF treatments, HaCaT cells were incubated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for different times. UVA (24 J/cm2) and EGF (100 ng/ml) induced similar EGFR down-regulation upon incubation for 3 h (Fig. 1A). However, in contrast to UVA, EGF did not cause caspase-3 activation or PARP cleavage. Unlike UVA, EGFR phosphorylation increased dramatically upon incubation with EGF for 1 h. UVA caused more EGFR down-regulation than EGF at 6 and 9 h after exposure (Fig. 1B). To determine whether UVA-induced EGFR down-regulation involved protein synthesis, cycloheximide (CHX) (25 μg/ml) was added after UVA exposure. After 3 and 6 h the presence of CHX had no effect on EGFR levels as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 1C), indicating that UVA-induced EGFR down-regulation involves post-translational regulation initiated by UVA rather than protein synthesis. To determine whether UVB or UVC has a similar effect on EGFR levels to UVA, cells were exposed to UVB and UVC and then incubated for different times. As shown in Fig. 1D, UVB induced dramatic EGFR down-regulation and concurrent caspase-3 activation 6 h after UVB exposure (16 mJ/cm2). No EGFR degradation was observed within 2 h after UVB exposure (24 mJ/cm2). Similarly, UVC (5 and 20 mJ/cm2) also induced EGFR down-regulation and concurrent caspase-3 activation at 6 h after exposure (Fig. 1E); no EGFR degradation was detected within 2 h after UVC exposure. That UVA, UVB, and UVC caused EGFR down-regulation was also observed in A431 and HeLa cells (data not shown). UVA Does Not Induce Tyrosine Phosphorylation of EGFR as Efficiently as EGF—To determine whether UVA caused EGFR phosphorylation, HaCaT cells were irradiated with different doses of UVA and then incubated for 15 min. As shown in Fig. 2A, UVA up to 24 J/cm2 for 15 min did not cause an increase in EGFR phosphorylation as compared with the background level. However, EGF (100 ng/ml) produced a dramatic increase in EGFR phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). To investigate the mechanism of EGFR phosphorylation following UVA and EGF treatments, we compared the response to UVA and EGF in the presence of AG1478, a specific inhibitor of EGFR intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, and PP2, a selective inhibitor of Src family tyrosine kinases. Fig. 2B shows that when HaCaT cells were pretreated with 10 μm AG1478, EGFR phosphorylation was completely abolished after both UVA and EGF treatments. It is noteworthy that AG1478 even abolished the background phosphorylation of EGFR. Preincubation of cells with 10 μm PP2 resulted in inhibition of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation by EGF, but only minor inhibition was observed with UVA exposure (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR is because of the activation of both its intrinsic tyrosine kinase and the Src family tyrosine kinases, whereas only the activation of EGFR intrinsic tyrosine kinase is required for EGFR phosphorylation in UVA-treated cells. Additionally, UVA irradiation caused EGFR dimer formation at 3 and 6 h, and dimer level of EGFR decreased at 6 h as compared with that at 3 h after UVA (Fig. 2C). EGFR Intrinsic Kinase Activity and Its Activation Is Not Required for UVA-induced EGFR Down-regulation—To find out whether EGFR kinase activity is required for EGFR down-regulation, HaCaT cells were pretreated with AG1478, a specific EGFR kinase activity inhibitor. Both UVA and EGF caused increased EGFR phosphorylation (EGF was more efficient), and EGFR down-regulation at 6 h (Fig. 3A). The presence of 1 μm AG1478 decreased EGFR phosphorylation, whereas 10 μm AG1478 abolished the phosphorylation induced by both UVA and EGF (Fig. 3, A and B). However, inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation by AG1478 had different effects on EGFR down-regulation by UVA and EGF. The presence of AG1478 decreased EGF-induced EGFR down-regulation, whereas it enhanced UVA-induced EGFR down-regulation in an AG1478 concentration-dependent pattern (Fig. 3, A and C). These results indicated that EGFR kinase activity and EGFR phosphorylation are required for EGF-induced EGFR down-regulation but not for UVA-induced EGFR down-regulation. UVA Fails to Enhance EGFR Phosphorylation and Ubiquitination—Because EGF-induced EGFR down-regulation requires EGFR phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination (19Galcheva-Gargova Z. Theroux S.J. Davis R.J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2649-2655PubMed Google Scholar) mediated by c-Cbl, we carried out immunoprecipitation with EGFR antibody followed by immunoblotting to identify the underlying mechanism that resulted in the different pathways for EGF and UVA-induced EGFR down-regulation. As shown in Fig. 4A, exposure to EGF dramatically enhanced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, which reached a maximum after 30 min of incubation with EGF and then decreased. Compared with EGF, UVA resulted in little increase in EGFR phosphorylation within 60 min after exposure. In addition, tyrosine phosphorylation by EGF was observed concurrently with a dramatic increase in EGFR ubiquitination, whereas no such increase was seen within 60 min following exposure to UVA (Fig. 4A). c-Cbl is the ubiquitin ligase responsible for EGF-mediated ubiquitination of EGFR upon phosphorylation (13Yokouchi M. Kondo T. Houghton A. Bartkiewicz M. Horne W.C. Zhang H. Yoshimura A. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31707-31712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 20Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22151-22154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated activation of c-Cbl in HaCaT cells upon UVA and EGF exposure. As shown in Fig. 4B, enhanced c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation was detected after incubation with EGF, but not after UVA radiation. These findings suggest that, unlike EGF, UVA fails to induce rapid EGFR ubiquitination within 60 min after exposure, which is due to the fact that UVA is unable to enhance EGFR phosphorylation and the subsequent c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. It has been reported that ubiquitin/proteasome is involved in EGF-induced EGFR degradation (13Yokouchi M. Kondo T. Houghton A. Bartkiewicz M. Horne W.C. Zhang H. Yoshimura A. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31707-31712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 21Longva K.E. Blystad F.D. Stang E. Larsen A.M. Johannessen L.E. Madshus I.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether inhibition of proteasome would allow the accumulation of UVA-induced ubiquitination of EGFR. Cells were preincubated with or without a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, and then exposed to UVA (Fig. 4C). In the absence of MG132, no increase in EGFR ubiquitination was detected up to 6 h after UVA exposure. In contrast, in MG132-treated cells, UVA induced accumulation of EGFR ubiquitination at 3 and 6 h after exposure (Fig. 4C). No accumulation of EGFR ubiquitination at 1 h after UVA radiation was detected in the presence of MG132. Similar results were seen with lactacystin, another proteasome inhibitor (data not shown). Surprisingly, the presence of MG132 or lactacystin, the proteasome inhibitor, enhanced EGFR down-regulation at 6 h after UVA exposure (Fig. 4, D and E). Concurrently increased activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP were observed in the presence of MG132. In contrast, although caspase-3 was activated by the presence of MG132 or lactacystin, EGF-induced EGFR down-regulation was inhibited slightly by the presence of MG132 or lactacystin (Fig. 4E). This indicated that UVA-induced EGFR down-regulation is proteasome-independent. Several studies (22Authier F. Metioui M. Bell A.W. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33723-33731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23Beguinot L. Lyall R.M. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1991; 266: 21265-21273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that degradation of EGF-induced EGFR is mediated by lysosomal proteases. To investigate whether UVA-caused EGFR degradation is also mediated by lysosome, bafilomycin A1 and NH4Cl were used as lysosomal inhibitors. Bafilomycin A1 is a specific inhibitor of the proton pump V-type ATPase, which prevents the acidification of the endosomal compartments required for the maturation of lysosomal proteases. NH4Cl increases the pH in lysosomes to inhibit lysosomal degradation. As shown in Fig. 4E, the presence of bafilomycin and NH4Cl blocked EGF-induced EGFR down-regulation completely. In contrast, bafilomycin and NH4Cl did not prevent UVA-induced EGFR down-regulation. It should be noted that the presence of bafilomycin enhanced UVA-induced EGFR degradation and caspase-3 activation. These findings suggest that EGFR down-regulation after UVA exposure may not be mediated via the mechanisms of lysosome involvement in EGF treatment. UVA Induces EGFR Internalization—Because EGF-induced EGFR down-regulation involves the internalization of EGFR (25Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Lund K.A. Welsh J.B. Chang C.P. Walton G.M. Der C.J. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1989; 59: 33-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), we investigated the UVA effect on intracellular localization of EGFR by confocal microscopy using antibodies to EGFR, EEA1, and CD63 (Fig. 5). In control cells, EGFR was mainly localized to the plasma membrane. 20 min after UVA exposure, EGFR was internalized, and the presence of caspase inhibitors had no effect (Fig. 5A). However, cells incubated on ice showed EGFR staining mainly at the plasma membrane regardless of treatment with either EGF or UVA (data not shown). After incubation with EGF for 20 and 60 min at 37 °C, EGFR was internalized, showing a punctate pattern throughout the cytoplasm and colocalized with EEA1-positive early endosomes and CD63-positive late endosomes (Fig. 5, B and C). As compared with EGF, UVA radiation induced partial colocalization of EGFR and the early (EEA1) and late (CD63) endosome markers in a clustered pattern (Fig. 5, B and C). The presence of caspase inhibitors did not affect the colocalization of EGFR with EEA1-positive early endosomes and CD63-positive late endosomes (data not shown). UVA Causes Concurrent EGFR Down-regulation and Caspase-3 Activation—To elucidate the underlying regulation mechanism for EGFR down-regulation, we irradiated the HaCaT cells with 24 J/cm2 UVA and then incubated the cells for different times. As shown in Fig. 6A, EGFR was down-regulated in a time-dependent pattern. EGFR down-regulation was observed at 3 h after UVA exposure. This is consistent with the data shown in Fig. 1A. There was no change in control cells. Concurrently caspase-3 was activated in a time course that paralleled EGFR down-regulation. Similar results were observed for the cleavage of PARP, the substrate for active caspase-3. When we irradiated HaCaT cells with different doses of UVA from 4 to 32 J/cm2, a clear dose-dependent EGFR down-regulation was observed, concurrent with caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that EGFR down-regulation after UVA radiation is associated with caspase activation. EGFR Down-regulation Induced by UVA Is Dependent on Caspase Activation—To determine whether caspase activation is required for EGFR down-regulation after UVA exposure, we pretreated HaCaT cells with inhibitors DEVD, IETD, and LEHD for caspases-3, -8, and -9, respectively, and then irradiated the cells with UVA. After 6 h, UVA alone induced EGFR down-regulation as mentioned above (Fig. 7A). The presence of the caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD up to 50 μm showed an inhibitory effect but failed to block EGFR down-regulation completely (Fig. 7, A and B). In contrast, the presence of IETD or LEHD (10 μm), caspase-8 or -9 inhibitors, appeared to be more efficient in preventing UVA-induced EGFR down-regulation, whereas inhibition of both caspases-8 and -9 produced additive effects as compared with each alone. As expected, when HaCaT cells were pretreated with a combination of DEVD, IETD, and LEHD, EGFR down-regulation was blocked more than 80%. In parallel, pretreatment with these caspase inhibitors also inhibited PARP cleavage in a manner similar to that for EGFR down-regulation. Lower concentrations of these inhibitors (5 μm) showed similar protective effect on receptor down-regulation (data not shown). When we collected the attached cells and floating cells separately 24 h after UVA radiation, we found that in attached cells there was slight caspase-3 activation and EGFR down-regulation. However, in floating cells, caspase-3 was completely activated, and the remaining EGFR level was much lower than attached cells (Fig. 7C). These results indicate that EGFR down-regulation is dependent on caspase activation caused by UVA exposure, and the caspase cascade activation upon UVA exposure triggers the EGFR down-regulation. To identify whether EGFR is fully degraded or cleaved into smaller fragments, antibody recognizing both the N and C termini of EGFR Ab12 were used for Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 7D, EGFR down-regulation by either UVA or EGF was detected by immunoblotting with anti-EGFR Ab12; however, no smaller fragments were observed for"

Subunit PSST is the most likely carrier of iron-sulfur cluster N2, which has been proposed to play a crucial role in ubiquinone reduction and proton pumping. To explore the function of this subunit we have generated site-directed mutants of all eight highly conserved acidic residues in the Yarrowia lipolytica homologue, the NUKM protein. Mutants D99N and D115N had only 5 and 8% of the wild type catalytic activity, respectively. In both cases complex I was stably assembled but electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of the purified enzyme showed a reduced N2 signal (about 50%). In terms of complex I catalytic activity, almost identical results were obtained when the aspartates were individually changed to glutamates or to glycines. Mutations of other conserved acidic residues had less dramatic effects on catalytic activity and did not prevent assembly of iron-sulfur cluster N2. This excludes all conserved acidic residues in the PSST subunit as fourth ligands of this redox center. The results are discussed in the light of the structural similarities to the homologous small subunit of water-soluble [NiFe] hydrogenases.

The results are discussed in the light of the structural similarities to the homologous small subunit of water-soluble [NiFe] hydrogenases. Proton-translocating NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is the first of five complexes of oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondrial inner membrane. In complex I, two electrons are transported from NADH to ubiquinone via FMN and eight iron-sulfur clusters (1Carroll J. Fearnley I.M. Shannon R.J. Hirst J. Walker J.E. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 117-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In this process four protons are translocated across the membrane (2Wikström M.K.F. FEBS Lett. 1984; 169: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this process and the location and nature of the ubiquinone binding sites are still unclear (3Brandt U. Kerscher S. Dröse S. Zwicker K. Zickermann V. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Evidence obtained with bovine heart submitochondrial particles strongly suggests that iron-sulfur cluster N2 is directly involved in ubiquinone reduction: based on paramagnetic interaction, the distance between an ubisemiquinone radical and cluster N2 was estimated to be 8-11 Å (4Magnitsky S. Toulokhonova L. Yano T. Sled V.D. Hagerhall C. Grivennikova V.G. Burbaev D.S. Vinogradov A.D. Ohnishi T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 193-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Subunit PSST is the most likely carrier of iron-sulfur cluster N2. Site-directed mutagenesis of the homologue subunits in Escherichia coli (5Friedrich T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and Neurospora crassa (6Duarte M. Populo H. Videira A. Friedrich T. Schulte U. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) indicated that three cysteines of subunit PSST are ligands for cluster N2. These cysteines correspond to positions 86, 150, and 180 in the PSST homologous NUKM subunit of Yarrowia lipolytica. A glutamate residue (Glu-89 in Y. lipolytica) had been proposed as the fourth ligand (7Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 186-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), but this could be excluded by site-directed mutagenesis (8Ahlers P. Zwicker K. Kerscher S. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23577-23582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, the fourth ligand of cluster N2 is still not known. Albracht and co-workers (9Chevallet M. Dupuis A. Issartel J.P. Lunardi J.L. van Belzen R. Albracht S.P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1557: 51-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have proposed that complex I contains two iron-sulfur clusters N2 that have identical electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra and are bound by the two ferredoxin-like Fe4S4 binding motifs in the TYKY subunit. However, these two clusters in the TYKY subunit have been shown to be EPR-silent and designated N6a and N6b by Friedrich and coworkers (10Rasmussen T. Scheide D. Brors B. Kintscher L. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Biochem. 2001; 40: 6124-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Ubiquinone-analogous complex I inhibitors like 2-decyl-4-quinazolinyl amine (DQA), 1The abbreviations used are: DQA, 2-decyl-4-quinazolinyl amine; DBQ, n-decylubiquinone; dNADH, deamino-nicotinamide-adeninedinucleotide; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; HAR, hexa-ammine-ruthenium(III)-chloride; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. rotenone, and pyridaben are thought to prevent the terminal electron transfer step from cluster N2 to ubiquinone (7Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 186-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Using a trifluoromethyl derivative of pyridaben for photoaffinity labeling, the PSST subunit was identified as high-affinity target (11Schuler F. Yano T. Di Bernardo S. Yagi T. Yankovskaya V. Singer T.P. Casida J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4149-4153Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), suggesting that this subunit is in close vicinity to the ubiquinone binding site of complex I. It has been known for a long time that complex I is evolutionary related to [NiFe] hydrogenases (12Sauter M. Böhm R. Böck A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1523-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 13Albracht S.P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The [NiFe] hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio fructosovorans is a water soluble enzyme for which the molecular structure has been solved (24Rousset M. Montet Y. Guigliarelli B. Forget N. Asso M. Bertrand P. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Hatchikian E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11625-11630Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 26Montet Y. Amara P. Volbeda A. Vernede X. Hatchikian E.C. Field M.J. Frey M. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nature Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). This enzyme consists of a large and a small subunit. The small subunit carries three iron-sulfur clusters, and part of its sequence is homologous to subunit PSST. The large subunit contains the [NiFe] cluster, and its sequence is homologous to the 49-kDa subunit of complex I. Based on a site-directed mutagenesis study in Y. lipolytica, it has been proposed that the ubiquinone-reactive catalytic core of complex I has directly evolved from the catalytic center of [NiFe] hydrogenases and that critical parts of the structural fold have been retained during evolution (14Kashani-Poor N. Zwicker K. Kerscher S. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24082-24087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). According to this model a significant part of the ubiquinone binding site and iron-sulfur cluster N2 are predicted to reside at the interface between the 49-kDa and PSST subunits of complex I (15Kerscher S. Kashani-Poor N. Zwicker K. Zickermann V. Brandt U. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To search for the fourth ligand of iron-sulfur cluster N2 and to identify functionally important amino acids in subunit PSST, we have constructed and characterized mutants for all highly conserved acidic residues in the homologous subunit of Y. lipolytica, the NUKM protein. Substrates and Inhibitors—n-decylubiquinone (DBQ), deamino-NADH (dNADH), hexa-ammine-ruthenium(III)-chloride (HAR), and rotenone were purchased from Sigma, hygromycin B from Invitrogen, and DQA was a generous gift from Aventis CropScience, Frankfurt am Main (Germany). Strains—Y. lipolytica strains E129 (MatB, lys 11-23, ura3-302, leu2- 270, xpr2-322) and E150 (MatA, his-1, ura3-302, leu2-270, xpr2-322) were a kind gift from Prof. C. Gaillardin (Institute National de la Recherche Agronomique, Paris, France). Complex I deletion strains could be generated after redirecting the alternative NADH dehydrogenase (NDH2) to the matrix site (16Kerscher S. Eschemann A. Okun P.M. Brandt U. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3915-3921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The internal version of NDH2 (NDH2i) rescues complex I deficiency, allowing the survival of mutants lacking complex I function. The NUKM gene was deleted by homologous recombination with a LEU2-marked deletion allele (8Ahlers P. Zwicker K. Kerscher S. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23577-23582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To purify complex I by Ni2+ affinity chromatography, a six alanine spacer plus a His6 tag was attached to the C terminus of the NUGM (30 kDa) subunit (17Kashani-Poor N. Kerscher S. Zickermann V. Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and integrated at the NUGM locus by pop-in-pop-out recombination (18Kerscher S. Dröse S. Zwicker K. Zickermann V. Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The two strains were conjugated, and the resulting diploid strain was sporulated to obtain a strain with both the NUGM-tag and the nukm::LEU2 alleles. LEU2+ spores were tested for the absence of the genomic copy of NUKM using the polymerase chain reaction PCR and Southern blotting. Site-directed Mutagenesis of NUKM—Point mutations were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method from Stratagene, using as template a 2.3-kb EcoRI genomic fragment from the NUKM locus, subcloned into the replicative vector pUB4 carrying the HygB R resistance gene. Mutated plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing and used for transformation of the deletion strain nukm::LEU2-NUGM-tag. Transformants were selected by hygromycin B resistance, and the mutation was reconfirmed by sequencing of the entire open reading frame on the plasmid. The mutations were analyzed in comparison to the pUB4 complemented deletion strain nukm::LEU2-NUGM-tag as parental strain. Purification of Complex I—Unsealed mitochondrial membranes were prepared from parental and mutant haploid strains (nukm::LEU2, ura3, leu2, lys11, pUB4-nukm mut/Hyg) as described previously (17Kashani-Poor N.

Complex I was purified by extraction of mitochondrial membranes with dodecyl maltoside followed by Ni2+-agarose and size exclusion chromatography (17Kashani-Poor N. Kerscher S. Zickermann V. Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Affinity purification of His-tagged complex I, followed by gel filtration, gave pure enzyme (∼95%) with a total yield of 38% for the parental strain. Blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described in Ref. 20Schägger H. Hunte C. von Jagow G. Schägger H. Membrane Protein Purification and Crystallization: A Practical Guide. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2003: 105-130Crossref Google Scholar. EPR Spectroscopy—Low temperature EPR spectra were obtained on a Bruker ESP 300E spectrometer equipped with a liquid helium continuous flow cryostat, ESR 900 from Oxford Instruments. Samples of purified complex I were mixed with NADH in the EPR tube and frozen in liquid nitrogen after 30 s reaction time. Spectra were recorded at 12 K or at 40 K with the following instrument settings: microwave frequency 9.475 GHz, microwave power 1 mW, modulation amplitude 0.64 mT. Under these conditions spectra show contributions from clusters N1, N2, N3, and N4 (21Djafarzadeh R. Kerscher S. Zwicker K. Radermacher M. Lindahl M. Schägger H. Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Redox Titrations—For redox titrations mitochondrial membranes (∼200 mg protein) were sedimented by centrifugation for 1 h at 48,000 × g. The pellet was suspended in 30 ml of buffer containing 30 mm each of sodium-acetate, Mes, Mops, Tris, glycine, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA and centrifuged as before. After one additional washing step the resulting pellet was suspended in 4-5 ml of the above buffer yielding a final protein concentration of 25-30 mg/ml. The following redox mediators were added to a final concentration of 30 μm each: tetramethyl-phenylenediamine, phenazine-methosulfate, methylene blue, menadione, resorufin, indigotrisulfonate, 1,2-naphthoquinone, 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, phenosafranine, benzyl viologen, and methyl viologen. Redox titrations were performed anaerobically as described in Ref. 22Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; LIV: 411-435Crossref Scopus (731) Google Scholar. The membrane suspension was poised at appropriate potential values by small additions of freshly prepared 50 mm dithionite. Aliquots were anaerobically transferred into an EPR tube, frozen rapidly in cold isopentane/methylcyclohexane (5:1), and stored in liquid nitrogen. Cluster N2 reduction rate in the frozen samples was then determined by recording EPR spectra at 12 K from samples poised at redox potentials between +100 and -500 mV. After subtraction of the oxidized spectrum recorded at a redox poise between +30 and -30 mV, to eliminate signal contributions from components with higher redox potential, the intensity of the N2 EPR signal was calculated by scaling it to a simulated N2 spectrum. The resulting N2 reduction rates were fitted to the Nernst equation using PSI Plot (Poly Software International, Salt Lake City, UT). Activity Measurements—dNADH:DBQ oxidoreductase activity was assayed at 30 °C in a Shimadzu UV-300 spectrophotometer as dNADH oxidation rate (ϵ340-400 nm = 6.22 mm-1 cm-1) in the presence of 100 μm dNADH and 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and 2 mm KCN. The reaction was started by the addition of 60 μm DBQ. Inhibitors were added from stock solutions (10 mm in ethanol) prior to DBQ. Michaelis-Menten parameters were determined by varying the concentration of DBQ (2-100 μm), and data were analyzed with the Enzfitter Software-Package (Version 2.0.16.0, Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Detergent- and inhibitor-insensitive NADH:HAR activity was measured using 200 μm NADH and 2 mm HAR, 2 mm NaN3 in 20 mm Na+/Hepes, pH 8.0, at 30 °C (23Sled V.D. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and used to quantify the complex I content in the membranes. The reaction was started by the addition of 50 μg (total protein) of unsealed mitochondrial membranes. To test for temperature stability mitochondrial membranes were incubated for 5 mins at increasing temperatures (30-60 °C) before NADH:HAR activity was tested as described at 30 °C. By alignment of protein sequences of PSST homologous subunits of complex I from different species, eight highly conserved acidic amino acids could be identified (Fig. 1). We have explored their possible role in the catalytic mechanism of complex I by site-directed mutagenesis of the NUKM gene in Y. lipolytica (Y. lipolytica numbering is used throughout, but the bovine name PSST is used in most cases). The resulting mutants were characterized in terms of complex I assembly and function. Data from an earlier study in which we had reported the results from mutagenesis of four of the eight positions (8Ahlers P. Zwicker K. Kerscher S. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23577-23582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) are included here for comparison and completeness (see Table I). As a qualitative test for complex I assembly, mitochondrial membranes from each mutant were subjected to blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and complex I content was quantified by NADH:HAR activity of mitochondrial membranes. All mutants analyzed in this study were found to have fully assembled complex I (data not shown), and its content in mitochondrial membranes was within the range commonly observed with the parental strain (Table I). The catalytic activity of complex I toward quinones was measured as specific dNADH:DBQ oxidoreductase activity and normalized to complex I content in the membranes. Table I summarizes the data obtained with mitochondrial membranes from all Y. lipolytica mutants and lists the K m and V max values for dNADH:DBQ activity and the I 50 values for the complex I inhibitors DQA and rotenone.Table ICharacterization of mutants in the PSST homologous NUKM subunitStrainComplex I contentaComplex I content in mitochondrial membranes is expressed as relative specific NADH:HAR activity that is not affected by mutations in the NUKM subunit.

Open table in a new tab Codon 99 in the NUKM open reading frame translates into a fully conserved aspartic acid (Fig. 1). Changing this carboxylate into its corresponding amide asparagine resulted in almost complete loss (<5% residual activity) of dNADH:DBQ oxidoreductase activity in the presence of saturating amounts of both substrates. Due to this very low activity, determination of K m, V max, and I 50 values for complex I inhibitors was not possible. Affinity purification of complex I from mutant D99N was successful, but the yield in two independent purification experiments was only 25% as compared with the parental strain. As the content of complex I in membranes was only slightly lower that in the parental strain, the low purification yield suggested a somewhat lower stability of complex I in mutant D99N. The observation of decreased temperature stability of NADH:HAR oxidoreductase activity in D99N membranes was consistent with this interpretation (data not shown). This structural instability was also evident from the fact that in the first complex I preparation from this mutant, cluster N2 was not detectable by EPR spectroscopy whereas the spectra of all other visible clusters were unaffected. In the second batch of complex I from mutant D99N, the presence of iron-sulfur cluster N2 was clearly evident from EPR spectra recorded at 12 K and the gz value for iron-sulfur cluster N2 was not shifted, indicating that the mutation had not influenced ligand geometry (Fig. 2). To compensate for different complex I concentrations all spectra were normalized to the N1 gz signal intensity of the parental enzyme at 40 K (not shown). At this temperature cluster N1 can be measured selectively avoiding background effects from other overlapping iron-sulfur clusters, like iron-sulfur cluster S3 of complex II. At 12 K the signal of this cluster contributed significantly to the slightly shifted peak at the N1 field position, indicating that significant amounts of complex II were present as an impurity in the complex I preparation from mutant D99N. Using signal calibration at 40 K, the amplitude of the gz signal of cluster N2 in complex I from the parental strain and mutant could still be compared showing that in the second batch of complex I from mutant D99N the amount of N2 was decreased by about 50%. The lowered cluster N2 content was also evident from the gxy region of the EPR spectra, but because signals originating from all iron-sulfur clusters overlap in this field position this signal could not be used for quantitation. To test a more conservative mutation that left the carboxylic acid function at position 99 intact, we replaced the aspartic acid with glutamic acid: in terms of assembly and complex I content in mitochondrial membranes D99E did not show any significant difference compared with the parental strain or mutant D99N. Also dNADH: DBQ activities of D99E and D99N were comparable (< 5% of the wild type rate). As a more drastic mutation, we changed aspartic acid 99 into glycine. In membranes from mutant D99G, complex I was still fully assembled in normal amounts and dNADH:DBQ activity was as low as for mutants D99N and D99E. A second fully conserved aspartic acid residue in the NUKM sequence codon 115 (Fig. 1) was mutagenized to give asparagine or glutamic acid. Both mutants, D115N and D115E, contained assembled complex I, but dNADH:DBQ oxidoreductase activities were found to be only ∼8% of the wild type rate. Like for the Asp-99 mutants, this low activity made the determination of K m, V max, and I 50 values for complex I inhibitors impossible. The purification of complex I from both mutants gave a yield of 39% for D115N and 35% for D115E as compared with the parental strain. Like in the case of mutant D99N, this low yield suggested some destabilization of complex I, which was also reflected in a slight decrease in temperature stability (data not shown). EPR spectroscopy of complex I isolated from D115N (Fig. 2) showed that the gz values for clusters N1, N3, and N4 were not changed and that their relative amplitudes were comparable with complex I from the parental strain. Like in the case of D99N, the gz signal for cluster N2 was not shifted, but a reduction in signal intensity by about 50% was observed. This was also evident from the gxy region of the N2 spectrum. As for Asp-99, the aspartic acid in position 115 was also changed into glycine. Complex I content and assembly in mitochondrial membranes from mutant D115G was normal, and dNADH:DBQ oxidoreductase activity was not significantly different from D115N and D115E. Based on these results we could not fully exclude the possibility that Asp-99 and Asp-115 form a pair of hydrogen bonds to iron-sulfur cluster N2, as in this case elimination of either residue still may have allowed assembly of the [Fe4S4] center. For this scenario, the midpoint potential of the redox center is predicted to change in the mutants due to the removal of one the hydrogen bonds. Therefore, we determined the midpoint potential of cluster N2 in membranes from mutants D99N and D115N. As shown in Fig. 3, the values of 120-130 mV for both mutants were not significantly different from that obtained for the parental strain. A third fully conserved aspartate is located at position 174 (see Fig. 1). This position was changed into asparagine. Complex I content in membranes from mutant D174N was within the range commonly observed for the parental strain. V max for DBQ and I 50 values for rotenone and DQA were not significantly changed, whereas the K m value for ubiquinone was slightly increased (Table I). No significant effects on complex I had been observed previously when the fourth fully conserved aspartate, Asp-168, had been changed into asparagine (Ref. 8Ahlers P. Zwicker K. Kerscher S. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23577-23582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar and Table I). Two fully conserved glutamic acids can be identified in the sequences of complex I subunits homologous to subunit PSST (see Fig. 1), E89 and E185. Glutamate 89 has a position close to cysteine 86, and glutamate 185 is located near cysteine 180; both cysteines are possible ligands for cluster N2. Mutant E185Q exhibited a moderate 65% decrease in dNADH:DBQ activity. The K m value for DBQ was increased about 2-fold, but I 50 values for rotenone and DQA were the same as for the parental strain (Table I). The purification of complex I from mutant E185Q was successful, and the yield obtained from this mutant isolation was comparable with the parental strain. The EPR spectrum from E185Q was virtually indistinguishable from spectra of parental complex I: there were no effects on positions of the gz signals of clusters N1, N2, N3, and N4, and their intensities were also unaffected (Fig. 2). This is in contrast to mutants E89Q, E89C, and E89A that exhibited shifted gz values and decreased signal intensities for iron-sulfur cluster N2 (8Ahlers P. Zwicker K. Kerscher S. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23577-23582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and slightly lowered I 50 values for DQA (Table I). Mutant E89Q also exhibited a reduced K m value for ubiquinone. In the positions corresponding to codons 136 and 140 of the NUKM gene an acidic residue (Asp or Glu) is found in all known sequences of PSST homologous subunits. When these two amino acids were changed in their corresponding amides (8Ahlers P. Zwicker K. Kerscher S. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23577-23582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), ubiquinone reductase activity of complex I was found to be moderately decreased, and hypersensitivity to rotenone and slight resistance to DQA was observed (Table I). By changing every one of eight conserved acidic residues in the PSST-homologous NUKM subunit of Y. lipolytica complex I, we have made an initial assessment of their role in complex I function. Two aspartates, Asp-99 and Asp-115, were found to be absolutely essential for complex I function as even the two most conservative exchanges possible, introducing an additional methylene group by changing them to glutamate or removing the charge by introducing the amide asparagine, resulted in almost complete loss of ubiquinone reductase activity. We could exclude by redox titration with membranes from mutants D99N and D115N that a shift in the midpoint potential of iron-sulfur cluster N2 was blocking electron transfer. Although mitochondrial membranes from all four mutants contained virtually normal amounts of complex I, a decrease in complex I stability became evident from lower yields during protein purification and a concomitant partial loss of iron-sulfur cluster N2. Even the rather drastic exchange of each of the aspartates to glycine still allowed normal assembly of complex I; residual activity and stability of complex I was practically the same as for the more conservative exchanges. The very similar effect of rather different amino acid exchanges in these two positions makes it tempting to speculate that in all cases a similar local change of a structural configuration occurred and that the resulting collapsed configuration was incompatible with ubiquinone reductase activity of complex I. As shown in our earlier study (8Ahlers P. Zwicker K. Kerscher S. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23577-23582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the ligand field geometry of iron-sulfur cluster N2 is affected specifically when Glu-89 was exchanged with alanine, cysteine, or glutamine and mutations D136N and E140Q have significant effects on inhibitor binding (see Table I). Changing Asp-168, Asp-174, or Glu-185 to the corresponding amide had little or no effect on complex I. EPR spectra of complex I from all mutants showed normal or in one case somewhat shifted spectra of iron-sulfur cluster N2. The possibility that Asp-99 and Asp-115 form a pair of hydogen bonds to iron-sulfur cluster N2 could be excluded as the midpoint potentials in membranes from mutants D99N and D115N were unchanged. Therefore, all conserved acidic residues in the PSST subunit can be excluded as fourth ligand of this redox-center. A more detailed interpretation of the observed effects is difficult without a high-resolution structure of complex I. It has been demonstrated previously for mutants of the 49-kDa subunit, the homologue of the large hydrogenase subunit (15Kerscher S. Kashani-Poor N. Zwicker K. Zickermann V. Brandt U. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), that structural homologies to water-soluble [NiFe] hydrogenases for which x-ray structures are available (24Rousset M.

Biol. 1997; 4: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) can be very useful to understand structure/function relationships in complex I. Our results suggest that also a comparison of the small subunit of water-soluble [NiFe] hydrogenases and the PSST subunit of complex I provides important clues (Fig. 4). Subunit PSST is much smaller than the small hydrogenase subunit because the C-terminal half that forms the domain harboring two of the three iron-sulfur clusters of hydrogenase is completely missing (Fig. 4A). Sequence conservation in the remaining part of the protein is rather weak, but three of the four cysteines that ligate the third, proximal cluster in the small hydrogenase subunit are conserved in subunit PSST (see Fig. 1), allowing a reasonable alignment of the sequences. Changing the conserved acidic residues around Cys-180 had very little effect on the function of complex I; the corresponding residues in the hydrogenase structure (Fig. 4, magenta) are found at the interface to the C-terminal iron-sulfur domain that is missing in subunit PSST. In contrast, Cys-86 and adjacent Glu-89 are predicted to be near the interface between PSST and the 49-kDa subunit; this position is consistent with the observed distortions of the ligand field of iron-sulfur custer N2 observed in mutants E89Q, E89C, and E89A (8Ahlers P. Zwicker K. Kerscher S. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23577-23582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The four positions at which mutations had pronounced effects are located between Cys-86 and Cys-150. Although conservation between complex I subunits from different species was found to be very high in this part of the PSST subunit (36% identical residues between mammals and bacteria; see Fig. 1), this region has little similarity with the corresponding region of the small hydrogenase subunit (Fig. 4, blue) and is shortened by 30 amino acids (Fig 4A). This suggests that this part of the PSST subunit structure is rather different from the small subunit of hydrogenase, but it still seems reasonable to assume that the position of this domain relative to the iron-sulfur cluster ligating cysteines has remained the same. It is important to note that based on this proposal this part of the PSST subunit would be predicted to be adjacent to regions of the 49-kDa subunit (Fig. 4, green) in which mutations causing inhibitor resistance (14Kashani-Poor N.

Brandt, manuscript in preparation. Conservative mutations of acidic amino acids in the region between Cys-86 and Cys-150 caused almost complete loss of catalytic activity (Asp-99 and Asp-115) or significant hypersensitivity to rotenone and resistance to DQA (Asp-136 and Glu-140). This fits well with the observation that mutation V119M was found previously to cause a 50% decrease in activity and a moderate hypersensitivity for DQA (28Ahlers P. Garofano A. Kerscher S. Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We had reconstructed this mutation in Y. lipolytica because the homologous V122M substitution in the human NUDFS7 gene had been reported to cause Leigh-Syndrome (29Triepels R. Van den Heuvel L.P.

Wurtman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11946-11950Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Likewise, sympathetic neurons also increase phospholipid biosynthesis during axonal growth (2Vance J.E. Pan D. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). PC, the predominant phospholipid in mammalian membranes, is synthesized primarily by the Kennedy pathway in which choline is phosphorylated by choline kinase to phosphocholine, which is converted to CDP-choline and subsequently to PC (3Vance D. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes, 4th Edition. Elsevier Science B. V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands2003: 205-232Google Scholar). In this pathway, the conversion of phosphocholine to CDP-choline, catalyzed by CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT), is the rate-limiting step. To date, two murine/human genes encoding CT isoforms have been identified: Pcyt1a and Pcyt1b. CTα, the product of Pcyt1a, is expressed in all tissues. CTβ2 and CTβ3, which are splice variants of murine Pcyt1b, are both enriched in brain compared with other tissues (4Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 5Karim M. Jackson P. Jackowski S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1633: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, whereas CTβ2 is expressed in both embryonic and adult mouse brain, CTβ3 is found only in adult brain (5Karim M. Jackson P. Jackowski S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1633: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Orthologs of CTα and CTβ2 have been cloned from rat and have similar tissue distributions to those in mouse (6Xiong Y. Liu X.-I. Wang Y. Du Y.C. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 283: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in rat hippocampus, CTβ2 mRNA is upregulated by arginine vasopressin4–8, a metabolite of arginine vasopressin known to enhance memory and promote neurite growth in hippocampal neurons (6Xiong Y. Liu X.-I. Wang Y. Du Y.C. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 283: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). PC12 cells are widely used for studies on neurite growth that is induced by nerve growth factor (NGF) (7Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar). NGF elicits neurite outgrowth via activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) (8Vaudry D. Stork P.J.S. Lazarovici P. Elden L.E. Science. 2002; 296: 1648-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). MAP kinase signaling has also been implicated in ganglioside-dependent neurite outgrowth in murine Neuro2a cells (9Prinetti A. Iwabuchi K. Hakomori S.-i. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20916-20924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), which rapidly differentiate in response to retinoic acid. We hypothesized that in differentiating neuronal cells PC biosynthesis is stimulated by an increase in CT activity and/or expression. To test this hypothesis, we examined PC biosynthesis, CT activity and CT isoform expression in PC12 cells and in Neuro2a cells. The results demonstrate a role for CT in neuritogenesis. Specifically, we observed a striking induction in expression of the CTβ2 isoform during neurite outgrowth. Materials—The MAP kinase/ERK kinase1/2 inhibitor, U0126, was obtained from Promega. All trans-retinoic acid was from Sigma. All cell culture media and reagents were from Invitrogen. Cell Culture—PC12 cells were obtained from the American Type Cell Culture Collection. Cells were maintained in F12-K medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For differentiation experiments, cells were seeded on collagen-coated 35-mm dishes at a density of 1 × 105 cells/dish. Cells were incubated overnight and then 50 ng/ml 2.5 S NGF (Alomone Labs) was added. For NGF-withdrawn conditions, the cells were grown in NGF-containing medium for 5 days after which the medium was removed and replaced with control medium lacking NGF. All cells were harvested on day 9. The MAP kinase inhibitor, U0126, was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and added to the medium to give a final concentration of inhibitor of 50 μm. The control medium contained the same amount of vehicle. The murine neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro2a, was a generous gift from Dr. David Williams (State University of New York, Stonybrook). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F12 medium (1:1 ratio) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. For differentiation experiments, cells were plated on 35-mm dishes at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells per dish in DMEM containing 2% fetal bovine serum. Following an overnight incubation, cell medium was replaced with DMEM with 2% fetal bovine serum containing 20 μm retinoic acid (Sigma). After incubation for 48 h, cells were harvested in homogenization buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin) and treated as described for PC12 cells. PC Measurements and CT Assays—Cells were collected in 1 ml of homogenization buffer A. The cells were counted and then sonicated for 20sat4 °C. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 5 min to pellet nuclei and unbroken cells. Aliquots of supernatant were used for lipid extractions, CT activity assays, and immunoblotting. For fractionation of membranes and cytosol, an aliquot of the cell lysate was centrifuged at 470,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant corresponded to the cytosol fraction; the pellet (microsomal fraction) was re-suspended in homogenization buffer A. All protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin used as a standard. CT activities in the total homogenate, soluble and membrane fractions were determined in the presence of PC:oleate vesicles by monitoring the conversion of phospho[3H]choline to CDP-[3H]choline as previously described (10Pelech S.L. Prtichard P.H. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8283-8286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNA Preparation and Reverse Transcriptase-mediated PCR—Total poly(A) RNA was isolated using the TRIZOL (Invitrogen) reagent as described by the manufacturer. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Superscript II, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Aliquots of the reverse transcribed product were used for PCR amplification with the following sequence-specific primers for CTα: AGTGGAGGAGAAGAGCATCG (sense) and GGAAGTCTTGCCAGAGAAGG (antisense); choline kinase α, GTGAATGGATGGCTCCACTC (sense) and ACCTTCAAAGCCTGGTCATG (antisense); cyclophilin TCCAAAGACAGCAGAAAACTTTCG (sense) and TCTTCTTGCTGGTCTTGCCATTC (antisense); CTβ3: AAATGCAGCATGGACAAGG (sense) and TTTGCTTGCATAAGTGCCC (antisense). Two separate primer pairs were used for PCR amplification of CTβ2: pair 1, CCAAGGAGCTGAATGTCAGC (sense) and GCACTTGTTAACCAGGCACC (antisense); pair 2, GCCATGCCAGTAGTTACCACT (sense) and TTTGCTGCATAAGTGCCC (antisense). All PCR amplifications used the following program: 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1.5 min and 72 °C for 1.5 min for a total of 32 thermocycles (40 cycles for CTβ3), which was within the linear response range for each primer pair. The primers generated amplicons of the following sizes: CTα, 232 bp; CTβ2, 452 bp (pair 1) and 302 bp (pair 2); CTβ3, 218 bp; choline kinase α (200 bp); and cyclophilin, 380 bp. All amplified products were resolved on 1.5% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. The amounts of the products generated with the CTα, choline kinase α, CTβ2 and CTβ3 primer pairs were normalized to the amount of cyclophilin product. RNase Protection Assays—Ribonuclease protection assays were performed using a RPA III™ kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 5 μg of total RNA was hybridized to 32P-labeled antisense riboprobes corresponding to CTα, CTβ2, or cyclophilin. Following an overnight hybridization, the RNA was digested with a single-strand-specific RNase (Ambion) and then separated on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. Riboprobe-protected fragments were predicted to be 200bp (CTα), 200bp (CTβ2), and 250bp (cyclophilin). Immunoblots—Anti-human CTβ2 and anti-human CTα rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generous gifts from Dr. S. Jackowski (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). The CTβ2 antibody was raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 347–365 of CTβ2 (4Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The CTα antibody was raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 1–17 of CTα (4Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein in cell lysates were separated by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS and transferred onto Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore). Ponceau S stain was used to compare protein loading in all lanes of the gel. The membranes were blocked for 2 h with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and then incubated overnight with either anti-CTα (dilution 1:1,000) or anti-CTβ2 (dilution 1:1,000) antibodies. The blots were washed with TBS-T for 1 h and incubated with secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase linked to anti-rabbit IgG (1/2500 dilution) for 1 h. After incubation the blot was washed with TBS-T and visualized with Amersham Biosciences ECL reagents. NGF Increases Cellular Protein and Phosphatidylcholine Levels in PC12 Cells—PC12 cells require NGF for differentiation to a neuronal phenotype; however, this differentiation is reversible. Once NGF is removed from the culture medium, the cells retract their neurites and resume proliferation. In our experiments, PC12 cells were incubated with medium containing 50 ng/ml NGF for 9 days (NGF), incubated with 50 ng/ml NGF for 5 days then cultured in medium lacking NGF for 4 more days (NGF-Withdrawn) or incubated without NGF throughout the experiment (Control). As expected, untreated cells continued to proliferate while NGF-treated cells stopped proliferating and started to extend neurites by day 3 of NGF treatment. NGF-withdrawn cells extended neurites during NGF treatment but the neurites retracted when NGF was removed from the culture medium. Previous studies have shown that incubation of PC12 cells with NGF significantly increases cellular protein content as well as PC content (1Araki W. Wurtman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11946-11950Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We used these two parameters, along with the presence of neurites, to confirm that the PC12 cells were responding appropriately to NGF treatment. After 9 days of NGF treatment, the amount of protein per cell increased by 78% compared with that of control cells (373 pg/cell versus 209 pg/cell) (Fig. 1A). Prior to NGF withdrawal on day 5, NGF-withdrawn cells had significantly higher cellular protein compared with that in control cells; however, at day 9, when the cells had been deprived of NGF for 4 days, cellular protein was no longer significantly different from that of control cells (258 pg/cell). Fig. 1B demonstrates that treatment with NGF doubled the PC content per cell (p < 0.001). In contrast, the level of PC in the NGF-withdrawn cells was not significantly different from that in control cells. These results confirm that the increase in cellular protein and PC content is dependent on NGF and coincident with neurite outgrowth. NGF Stimulates CT Activity in PC12 Cells—Consistent with previous studies (1Araki W. Wurtman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11946-11950Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), NGF did not significantly increase CT activity in vitro when the activity was normalized to mg of protein (Fig. 2A, 3.24 nmol/min/mg protein and 3.39 nmol/min/mg protein in control and NGF-treated cells, respectively). Nor did NGF withdrawal alter CT activity. However, since NGF-dependent differentiation substantially increased the amount of protein per cell (Fig. 1A), presumably due to neurite outgrowth, we also normalized CT activity to cell number. Fig. 2B shows that NGF significantly increased CT activity per cell by greater than 100% (p < 0.001, Fig. 2B). Furthermore, in cells that were treated with NGF and in which NGF was subsequently withdrawn, CT activity returned to a level no longer significantly different from that in control cells. These results suggest that the increase in CT activity is dependent on NGF and coincides with neurite outgrowth. CT, an amphitropic enzyme, is activated by translocation from a soluble form to a membrane-associated form (11Sleight R. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10644-10650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Vance D.E. Pelech S.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1984; 9: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We assayed soluble and membrane fractions of PC12 cells to determine whether or not NGF increased CT activity by promoting CT translocation to membranes. As shown in Fig. 3A, NGF significantly increased CT activity in the membrane fraction compared with that of control cells (p < 0.01). CT activity in membranes from NGF-withdrawn cells was not significantly different from that of control membranes. NGF did not significantly alter CT activity in the soluble fraction (Fig. 3B). Together, these results suggest that NGF activates CT by increasing its activity on cellular membranes. However, since we did not observe a corresponding decrease in soluble CT activity (Fig. 3B), we hypothesized that NGF might also upregulate CT expression. NGF Induces CTβ2 mRNA Expression—To determine whether or not NGF increased expression of the different CT isoforms, we assessed the mRNA abundance of the three known rodent isoforms of CT (CTα, CTβ2, and CTβ3) by semiquantitative RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 4A, when PC12 cells were treated with NGF for 9 days, CTβ2 expression dramatically increased compared with that in cells not treated with NGF. In NGF-withdrawn cells CTβ2 mRNA was barely detectable. Furthermore, NGF increased CTβ2 expression as early as 1 day after application, and CTβ2 mRNA abundance increased with prolonged NGF exposure (Fig. 4B). In contrast, NGF did not alter CTα mRNA expression or choline kinase α mRNA expression. (Fig. 4A). Since neither the murine nor the rat cDNA encoding CDP-choline:diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase has been cloned, we could not examine if NGF affected its expression. We also used a ribonuclease protection assay to obtain a more quantitative assessment of whether or not NGF affected CTα or CTβ2 expression. As shown in Fig. 5A, CTβ2 mRNA was barely detectable in PC12 cells incubated without NGF (lane 2). However, CTβ2 mRNA was dramatically increased in cells treated with NGF for 7 days (lane 3). In contrast, and consistent with the RT-PCR results (Fig. 4A), CTα mRNA abundance was unaffected by NGF treatment. The approximately equal abundance of the 100-bp ribonuclease-protected cyclophilin mRNA fragment in all samples confirmed that equivalent amounts of RNA were used in the hybridization reactions. Recently, a novel isoform of CTβ has been identified, CTβ3, which is predicted to be a splice variant of CTβ2 (5Karim M. Jackson P. Jackowski S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1633: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Like CTβ2, CTβ3 mRNA is found in mouse brain (5Karim M. Jackson P. Jackowski S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1633: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We used RT-PCR to determine whether PC12 or Neuro2a cells expressed CTβ3 mRNA. As shown in Fig. 5B, CTβ3 mRNA was undetectable in PC12 cells after 40 PCR cycles. For this reason, we conclude that CTβ3 plays little or no role in the NGF-dependent increase in CT activity in PC12 cells. NGF Increases the Amount of CTβ2 Protein and Promotes Translocation to Membranes—Since NGF treatment dramatically increased CTβ2 mRNA abundance, we hypothesized that NGF also increases the amount of CTβ2 protein. Fig. 6A demonstrates that NGF markedly increased the amount of CTβ2 protein compared with that in control cells. The anti-CTβ2 antibody produces a characteristic doublet which corresponds to the predicted 43-kDa CTβ2 protein and a larger, phosphorylated form of CTβ2 (4Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Moreover, when NGF was removed from the culture medium, and the PC12 cells retracted their neurites, the amount of CTβ2 protein decreased to virtually undetectable levels. In contrast, NGF treatment did not alter the amount of CTα protein (Fig. 6A). These results suggest that the increase in the amount of CTβ2 protein also depends on NGF and coincides with neurite outgrowth, consistent with the observed increases in PC content and CT activity. Since CT activity increased in the membrane fraction of NGF-treated PC12 cells, we hypothesized that NGF not only up-regulates the expression of CTβ2 specifically, but also activates CTβ2 by promoting its translocation from the soluble reservoir to membranes. Immunoblot analysis (Fig. 6B) demonstrated that membranes of NGF-treated PC12 cells contained more CTβ2 than did control or NGF-withdrawn cells. In contrast, membranes of NGF-treated cells did not show an appreciable increase in CTα immunoreactivity. The anti-CTα antibody revealed a doublet of immunoreactive bands in membranes from untreated, NGF-treated, and NGF-withdrawn PC12 cells, as well as in the positive control (10 μg of protein from a lysate of McArdle 7777 rat hepatoma cells, which overexpress CTα, data not shown). The lower band corresponds to the predicted size of CTα (41kDa) but the origin of the second, larger immunoreactive band in all of the samples is not clear. We conclude that NGF increases CT activity in two specific ways. First, NGF up-regulates CTβ2, but not CTα, expression. Second, NGF specifically activates CTβ2, but not CTα, by promoting the association of CTβ2 with membranes. U0126 Inhibits the NGF-dependent Increase in CT Activity and CTβ2 Expression—NGF signals through multiple intracellular cascades to promote neuronal survival and differentiation. Among these signaling cascades, MAP kinase is essential for neurite outgrowth (8Vaudry D. Stork P.J.S. Lazarovici P. Elden L.E. Science. 2002; 296: 1648-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 13Barrie A.P. Clohessy A.M. Buensuceso C.S. Rogers M.V. Allen J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19666-19671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In this pathway, NGF activates Ras, which activates mitogen-activated kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK), which subsequently activates MAP kinase. We, therefore, hypothesized that NGF signals through the MAP kinase pathway to induce CTβ2 expression and activation. We treated PC12 cells with U0126, an inhibitor of MEK1/2, which inhibits the MEK-dependent activation of MAP kinase, and examined its effect on CT activity and CTβ2 expression in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. Previous studies have shown that when NGF-treated PC12 cells are incubated with U0126 neurite extension is impaired compared with that in cells treated with NGF alone (14Kano Y. Nohno T. Hasegawa T. Takahashi R. Hiragami F. Kawamura K. Iwama M.K. Motoda H. Miyamoto K. Neurochem. Res. 2002; 27: 1655-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We, therefore, incubated PC12 cells for 5 days with 50 ng/ml NGF (NGF), with 50 ng/ml NGF and 50 μm U0126 (NGF/U0126), with 50 μm U0126 alone (U0126) or without both NGF and U0126 (control). Control and U0126-treated cells proliferated and exhibited no discernible morphological differences. Both NGF- and NGF/U0126-treated cells differentiated. However, fewer NGF/U0126-treated cells extended neurites and the average neurite length at 5 days was shorter than in NGF-treated cells. Consistent with the 9-day differentiation experiments (Fig. 2B), cells incubated with NGF for 5 days contained a significantly higher CT activity per cell than did control cells (p < 0.01, Fig. 7A). However, when PC12 cells were incubated with NGF in the presence of U0126, CT activity was not significantly different from that of control cells. We used semi-quantitative RT-PCR to examine whether or not U0126 attenuated CTβ2 mRNA and CTα mRNA expression. In cells treated with NGF and U0126 together, CTβ2 mRNA abundance was appreciably less than in NGF-treated cells (Fig. 7B). CTα mRNA abundance was the same under all treatment conditions (data not shown). These results support our hypothesis that MAP kinase signaling mediates the NGF-dependent increase in CTβ2 expression and the subsequent increase in CT activity. Retinoic Acid Stimulates CT Activity in Neuro2a Cells— Neurite outgrowth is characteristic of all differentiating neuronal cells. We, therefore, hypothesized that CTβ2 expression and CT activity would be increased in any cells that were actively growing neurites, rather than only in cells, which differentiate upon NGF treatment. To test this hypothesis, we measured CT activity in Neuro2a cells, which do not require NGF for differentiation but instead rapidly differentiate in response to treatment with retinoic acid (15Shea T.B. Fischer I. Sapirstein V.S. Dev. Brain Res. 1985; 21: 307-314Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We plated Neuro2a cells on 35 mm dishes and treated them with 20 μm retinoic acid for 48 h. Within 12 h after retinoic acid application, virtually all cells had stopped proliferating and had extended neurites longer than the diameter of a cell body. Retinoic acid-dependent differentiation increased cellular protein in Neuro2a cells (p < 0.01, Fig. 8A), similar to the situation in NGF-dependent differentiation of PC12 cells (Fig. 1A). Also similar to PC12 cells, CT activity per mg of protein did not increase (not shown) whereas the activity per cell increased by 54% (p < 0.0025) from 3.9 fmol/min/cell in cells incubated without retinoic acid to 6.0 fmol/min/cell in cells incubated with retinoic acid (Fig. 8B). From these data, we conclude that in both Neuro2a and PC12 cells, which differentiate in response to retinoic acid and NGF, respectively, CT activity is significantly increased during neurite outgrowth. Retinoic Acid Increases the Amount of CTβ2 Protein in Neuro2a Cells—Since retinoic acid treatment significantly increased CT activity in Neuro2a cells, we immunoblotted Neuro2A cell lysates to determine whether or not retinoic acid increased the amount of CT protein. As shown in Fig. 9, the amount of CTβ2 protein was substantially higher in retinoic acid-treated cells than in control cells. The amount of CTα protein in Neuro2a cells, however, was unaffected by retinoic acid treatment. Together these results support our hypothesis that CTβ2 expression and CT activity are increased during neurite outgrowth irrespective of the method of induction of differentiation. Neurite outgrowth places a high demand on neurons for membrane biosynthesis. This is especially true for PC biosynthesis since PC is the most abundant phospholipid in mammalian membranes. We have shown that during neurite growth of PC12 cells, NGF stimulates PC biosynthesis by specifically up-regulating the expression and activity of CTβ2. Furthermore, in Neuro2a cells, retinoic acid-induced differentiation also stimulated CTβ2 expression and increased CT activity. We conclude that in both of these neuronal cell lines, the demand for PC during neurite growth is accommodated by an elevation of CTβ2 expression, with a concomitant elevation in CT activity. CT Activity and Isoform Expression in NGF-treated PC12 Cells—CT is an amphitrophic enzyme (3Vance D. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes, 4th Edition. Elsevier Science B. V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands2003: 205-232Google Scholar), existing in a soluble form with low activity, and an active, membrane-associated form. Translocation of CT from a soluble form to membranes is a major mechanism of regulation of CT activity (11Sleight R. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10644-10650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Vance D.E. Pelech S.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1984; 9: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we found that in PC12 cells NGF regulated CT activity by promoting translocation of CT to membranes. Furthermore, CTβ2, but not CTα, protein increased in the membranes of NGF-treated cells (Fig. 6B). These observations provide the first evidence that one isoform of CT can be differentially activated over another isoform. The increase in membrane-associated CTβ2 in response to NGF was not simply due to an increase in the amount of CTβ2 protein, because the cytosolic CT activity was not increased in parallel. Previous reports have shown that the incorporation of labeled choline into PC increases dramatically when PC12 cells are exposed to NGF and that this increase in PC biosynthesis coincides with neurite outgrowth (1Araki W. Wurtman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11946-11950Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Similarly, in our experiments, PC mass per cell doubled in cells treated for 9 days with NGF. Consistent with a previous report (1Araki W. Wurtman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11946-11950Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), NGF treatment did not increase CT activity when measured in vitro per mg of protein. Nevertheless, as expected, the dramatic morphological changes of neuronal differentiation were associated with significant increases in cellular protein content (Fig. 1B); thus, we normalized our CT activity measurements to cell number as well as mg of protein. CT activity per cell increased by 50%"
https://openalex.org/W2017741366,"Type-I interferons (IFNs), also called IFNs-α/β, are a family of cytokines induced by viral infection and are primarily involved in antiviral defense of the cells. IFNs-α/β were also reported to be produced constitutively at low levels in mouse and human cells. These so-called endogenous or constitutive IFNs are thought to exert important homeostatic functions in the uninfected host. By searching IFN genes that were not repressed by the leader protein of Theiler's virus, we identified three uncharacterized IFN-α genes that are constitutively expressed in uninfected mouse cells, in vitro and in vivo. Two of these genes corresponded to pseudogenes and were tentatively called IFN-α(ψ2) and IFN-α(ψ3). IFN-α(ψ2) transcripts are the most abundant IFN-α transcripts detected in several mouse organs in the absence of viral infection. The third gene codes for a new IFN-α subtype called IFN-α13, which exhibits acid-stable antiviral activity against Theiler's virus, Mengo virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus. IFN-α13 displays unusual characteristics, suggesting that it might have a particular function. Firstly, it is transcribed constitutively, independent of viral infection and of interferon regulatory factor-7 induction. Secondly, it contains two N-glycosylation sites, in contrast to other murine IFN-α subtypes that contain either one or no N-glycosylation site. In addition to the genes described here above, several other IFN-α subtype genes, including a new gene (IFN-α14), were expressed in tissues of uninfected mice. In contrast to IFN-α13, IFN-α14 was found to lack N-glycosylation and have its expression induced in response to viral infection. Type-I interferons (IFNs), also called IFNs-α/β, are a family of cytokines induced by viral infection and are primarily involved in antiviral defense of the cells.

The third gene codes for a new IFN-α subtype called IFN-α13, which exhibits acid-stable antiviral activity against Theiler's virus, Mengo virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus. IFN-α13 displays unusual characteristics, suggesting that it might have a particular function. Firstly, it is transcribed constitutively, independent of viral infection and of interferon regulatory factor-7 induction. Secondly, it contains two N-glycosylation sites, in contrast to other murine IFN-α subtypes that contain either one or no N-glycosylation site. In addition to the genes described here above, several other IFN-α subtype genes, including a new gene (IFN-α14), were expressed in tissues of uninfected mice. In contrast to IFN-α13, IFN-α14 was found to lack N-glycosylation and have its expression induced in response to viral infection.

They are encoded by an intronless multigene family clustered on murine chromosome 4. To this date, 1 IFN-β and 13 IFN-α genes have been described in the mouse, including one pseudogene (1Zwarthoff E.C. Mooren A.T. Trapman J.

Classically, IFN-α/β have been studied for their potent antiviral activity but they also exert various immunoregulatory functions such as regulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-I antigen expression, interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-15 production, and natural killer cell activation, which shape the adaptive immune response to an invading pathogen (12Biron C.A.

Rev. 2001; 14: 778-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar).However, accumulating experimental evidence shows that low levels of IFN-α and IFN-β are constitutively expressed in mouse and humans (14Tovey M.G.

This finding suggests that in addition to their role as inducible inflammatory mediators, interferons exert important homeostatic functions in the uninfected host. A variety of regulatory functions have been proposed for constitutive IFN-α/β including regulation of hematopoietic cell growth (18Resnitzky D. Yarden A. Zipori D. Kimchi A. Cell. 1986; 46: 31-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), MHC-I class-I antigens expression, dendritic cell maturation (19Lee C.K. Gimeno R. Levy D.E. J. Exp.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2002; 13: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) have investigated the antitumoral role of constitutive IFN-α/β. More recently, Takaoka and co-workers (23Hata N. Sato M. Takaoka A. Asagiri M. Tanaka N. Taniguchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 24Mitani Y. Takaoka A. Kim S.H. Kato Y. Yokochi T. Tanaka N. Taniguchi T.

Biol. 2001; 2: 378-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) have elegantly shown that low levels of constitutive IFN-α/β are essential for effective IFN-γ and IL-6 signaling and for maintaining cells ready to switch on the antiviral response. However, the precise nature of the constitutive IFN-α in murine cells has never been determined.According to current models, induction of interferon transcription occurs as a two-step mechanism. In the mouse, IFN-α4 and IFN-β, the so-called “immediate-early interferons,” can be produced by naive cells upon viral infection. Transcription of these immediate-early interferons involves phosphorylation, dimerization, and subsequent nuclear translocation of a constitutively expressed transcription factor called interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) (27Servant M.J. Tenoever B. Lin R. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In contrast to IFN-α4 and IFN-β, the other IFN subtypes can only be produced in cells that have been “primed” through the binding of IFNs-α/β on their surface receptor. Priming induces the production of IRF-7, a transcription factor which upon viral infection will participate in the transcriptional activation of late IFN genes along with IRF-3 (28Marié I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We have previously shown that in murine fibroblasts infected with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV or Theiler's virus), IFN-α was transcribed despite the inhibition of the immediate-early IFN production by the leader peptide encoded by this virus (29van Pesch V. van Eyll O. Michiels T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7811-7817Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This result suggested that contrary to the predictions of the model, certain IFN-α subtype genes could be transcribed independently of the autocrine or paracrine loop mediated by the immediate-early IFNs.We report here the identification and the characterization of such genes. Two of these genes correspond to pseudogenes. The third gene encodes a novel IFN-α subtype that we tentatively called IFN-α13. This gene appears to be constitutively transcribed in vitro as well as in several mouse tissues, suggesting that it might correspond to one of the constitutive IFN-α gene. Interestingly, IFN-α13 displayed an unusual glycosylation pattern, suggesting that it could play a particular role as a homeostatic cytokine produced at very low levels by various cell types. We also investigated the nature of other IFN-α subtypes expressed in vivo in the absence of viral infection. Among these subtypes, we identified another undescribed murine IFN-α subtype that we called IFN-α14.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESViruses and Cell Culture—Viruses used in this study were Theiler's virus DA1 and its Lcys mutant, TM598, carrying two Cys to Arg mutations, disrupting the zinc finger of the L protein (29van Pesch V. van Eyll O. Michiels T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7811-7817Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 30Michiels T. Dejong V. Rodrigus R. Shaw-Jackson C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9549-9556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The KJ6 and TM659 are the corresponding wild-type and Lcys-mutant viruses carrying a capsid adapted to infect L929 cells (29van Pesch V. van Eyll O. Michiels T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7811-7817Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 31Jnaoui K. Michiels T. Virology. 1998; 244: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These viruses were produced as described previously by transfection of BHK-21 cells with viral RNAs transcribed in vitro from the corresponding infectious cDNA clones, pTMDA1, pTM598, pKJ6, and pTM659 (29van Pesch V. van Eyll O. Michiels T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7811-7817Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). An attenuated strain of Mengo virus was produced in a similar way from the pMC16 infectious clone (32Duke G.M. Palmenberg A.C. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1822-1826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VSV (Strain Indiana) was a gift from Eliane Meurs (Pasteur Institute, Paris, France). Viruses were titrated on BHK-21 cells by a standard plaque assay. BHK-21, COS-7, BALB/3T3, and L929 cells were cultured as described previously (29van Pesch V. van Eyll O. Michiels T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7811-7817Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—For the detection of cytokine mRNA, total RNA was extracted from cells using either the technique of Chomczynski and Sacchi (33Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62975) Google Scholar) or the Microprep® kit (Stratagene). Because the interferon genes are intronless, RNA samples (5–10 μg) were additionally treated once or twice with 20 units of DNase I (fast protein liquid chromatography-pure, Amersham Biosciences) prior to RT-PCR as described previously (34Shaw-Jackson C. Michiels T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2729-2738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RT-PCR reactions were performed with and without reverse transcriptase (Superscript-II, Invitrogen) to rule out that PCR products were amplified from genomic DNA contamination. For cloning purposes, enzymes used for amplification were Pfu polymerase (Promega) or Expand high fidelity (Roche Applied Science). For analytical purposes, Taq polymerase (Promega) or Dynazyme (Finnzymes, Thermo-life Science) were used. Primers used for PCR are shown in Supplemental Tables A–C. Primers used for IRF-7 amplification were as described by Marié et al. (28Marié I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primers for total IFN-α and IFN-β were as described by Chinsangaram et al. (35Chinsangaram J. Piccone M.E. Grubman M.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9891-9898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and primers for IFN-α4 were as described by Deonarain et al. (36Deonarain R. Alcami A. Alexiou M. Dallman M.J. Gewert D.R. Porter A.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3404-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).IFN-α Subtype Expression Profiling—Total IFN-α was amplified by RT-PCR using consensus primers for IFN-α (TM235–236). The fragment amplified with Dynazyme (Finnzymes, Thermo-life Science) was gel-purified and subsequently cloned by TOPO-TA cloning (Invitrogen). A series of clones containing an insert of the expected size was then sequenced with the CEQ sequencing kit (Beckman) using a Beckman CEQ2000 8-capillary sequencer. The identity of the cloned IFN fragments was then determined by BLAST homology search.Determination of New Murine Gene Sequences and Multiple Alignments—Using the BLAST algorithm (37Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59084) Google Scholar), we identified fragments from the Whole Mouse Genome Sequence (WGS) data base that aligned perfectly with our clones. The WGS fragments were further assembled using the MULTIALIN software (38Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4255) Google Scholar) into four new IFN-α gene sequences tentatively named IFN-α(ψ2), IFN-α(ψ3), IFN-α13, and IFN-α14.Construction of Luciferase Reporter Constructs—The putative promoters of IFN-α4, IFN-α5, IFN-α13, IFN-α(ψ2), and IFN-β were cloned in the pGL3 basic reporter plasmid (Promega) to drive the transcription of the firefly luciferase gene. Fragments cloned as putative promoter sequences were the 480 nucleotides preceding the IFN gene initiation codon and comprising the putative virus-responsive elements (39Braganca J. Civas A. Biochimie (Paris). 1998; 80: 673-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These fragments were amplified by PCR from L929 cells genomic DNA using Pfu polymerase (Promega) and cloned in pGL3-basic using Asp-718 and HindIII restriction sites introduced in the sense and antisense PCR primers, respectively (see Supplemental Tables A–C). Constructed plasmids were called pVV21 (IFN-α4), pVV31 (IFN-α5), pVV33 (IFN-α13), pVV30 (IFN-α(ψ2)), and pVV19 (IFN-β). All of the cloned fragments were sequenced to confirm that no unexpected mutation occurred during the PCR amplification and cloning steps.Cloning of Constructs Expressing IFN-α Subtypes—The coding sequence of IFN-α4, IFN-α5, IFN-α6T, IFN-α13, and IFN-α14 were amplified by PCR from 129/Sv mouse genomic DNA and cloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) downstream from the immediate-early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus (CMV). Cloning was performed using BamHI and XhoI restriction sites introduced in the PCR primers. Constructs were done in such a way that all of the clones contained identical sequences upstream and downstream from the IFN-coding sequences. The sequence from the BamHI restriction site to the second codon of the IFN reading frame was 5′-GGATCCACCATGGCT-3′. In this sequence, the CCACCATGG motif and in particular the underlined nucleotides (purine at position –3 and G at position +4) match a bona fide consensus defined by Kozak for efficient translation initiation. For IFN-α13, a second construct called pcDNA3-IFN-α13or was made in which the original translation initiation context of the gene was retained. In this clone, the sequence from the BamHI site to the second codon is 5′-GGATCCTTTTTAATGGCT-3′. In that sequence, the nucleotide in position –3 is a T instead of a purine. All of the clones were sequenced to confirm that no unexpected mutation occurred in the cloned fragment during the PCR amplification and cloning steps.Metabolic Labeling and Glycosylation Analysis—COS-7 cells seeded in 6-well plates were transfected with the different IFN-α-expressing constructs using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). 24 h after transfection, cells were washed twice and incubated for 24 h in 1 ml of methionine- and cysteine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN) containing one-tenth of the normal methionine concentration (3 mg/liter) and 70 or 80 μCi/ml 35S-labeled methionine-cysteine mixture (Redivue™ Pro-mix™, Amersham Biosciences). After a 24-h incubation at 37 °C, supernatants were collected, centrifuged at 15,000 × g to remove cell debris, and stored at –70 °C.Crude or glycosidase-treated (protein deglycosylation kit, Calbiochem) supernatants were diluted in sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 3% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) and run on Tris-Tricine and SDS-11% PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed.Antiviral Assay—Interferon antiviral activity was quantified by a cytopathic effect reduction assay adapted from Meager (40Meager A. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 261: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), performed in 96-well plates on BALB/3T3 cells. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1.5 104 cells/well. After 24 h, cells were incubated for an additional 24 h with 2-fold serial dilutions of the IFN-containing supernatants to be tested. Cells were then infected with Mengo virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 pfu/cell or with VSV at 100 pfu/well. Cytopathic effect was monitored by optical microscopy, and samples were compared at the time cells incubated without IFN were lysed. The well in which cytopathic effect was the closest to 50% was used to compare the relative antiviral activities of the IFN-α subtypes. IFNs to be compared were always tested in parallel. When necessary, a commercially available IFN-β preparation (PBL Biomedical Laboratories) of known titer was added to the series to calculate IFN activity.Accession Numbers—Sequences were deposited in GenBank™ or in the third party annotation database subset of GenBank™ under the following accession numbers: IFN-α13 (AY220461), IFN-α14 (AY220462), IFN-α4 (AY220463), IFN-α5 (AY220464), IFN-α6T (AY220465), IFN-α(ψ2) (BK001229), IFN-α(ψ3) (BK001230), IFN-α4 promoter cloned in pVV21 (AY226994), IFN-α5 promoter cloned in pVV31 (AY226995), IFN-α13 promoter cloned in pVV33 (AY226996), and IFN-α(ψ2) promoter cloned in pVV30 (AY226997).RESULTSIdentification of IFN-α Genes Transcribed Independently of the Immediate-early IFNs—We observed previously that in murine L929 fibroblasts infected with Theiler's virus, total IFN-α was transcribed despite the inhibition of immediate-early IFN production by the leader protein (L protein) of this virus (29van Pesch V. van Eyll O. Michiels T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7811-7817Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This observation suggested that, contrary to the predictions of actual models, some IFN-α subtypes could be expressed in the absence of autocrine or paracrine activation by immediate-early IFNs.To identify the nature of such IFN-α subtypes, total RNA was extracted from L929 or BALB/3T3 cells infected for 7 h with Theiler's virus expressing the wild-type L protein. Total IFN-α sequences were then amplified by RT-PCR, cloned, and sequenced. To our surprise, a majority of clones did not correspond to any of the known IFN-α sequences deposited in GenBank™ but their nucleotide sequences shared approximately 90% identity with that of IFN-α1. We identified fragments from the WGS data base that aligned perfectly with our clones. The WGS fragments were further assembled into three new IFN-α gene sequences that subsequently appeared in the supercontig of chromosome 4 (GenBank™ accession NT_039262).Two of these sequences corresponded to pseudogenes and were tentatively named IFN-α(ψ2) and IFN-α(ψ3). The third gene showed a complete open reading frame coding for a new IFN-α subtype that we tentatively named IFN-α13.Structure of the IFN-α13, IFN- α(ψ2), and IFN- α(ψ3) Genes—The IFN-α(ψ2) region lacks the AUG codon and contains multiple deletions and one insertion, disrupting the potential coding sequence (Fig. 1A). The IFN-α(ψ3) sequence contains one G to A mutation at nucleotide 50 that interrupts the open reading frame at codon 17. It contains two additional point deletions that create further frameshifts.The IFN-α13 gene codes a putative 189 amino acid-long protein containing a predicted signal sequence of 23 amino acids. The amino acid sequence aligns perfectly with that of other IFN-α subtypes. It shares 87% identity with IFN-α1 (Table I).Table IIdentity of IFN-α13 and IFN-α14 to other murine IFN-α subtypesα1α2α4α5α6α6Tα7α8α9α11αAαBα12α13α14α138780808784808384848484878810084α148780788388848788828386878984100 Open table in a new tab The putative promoter sequences of the IFN-α13, IFN- α(ψ2), and IFN- α(ψ3) genes contain potential virus-responsive element (VRE) in similar positions relative to those of classical IFN-α genes. However, in the three promoters, point mutations occurred in the modules known to regulate virus inducibility (Fig. 1B). No TATA box aligning with that of other IFN-α genes was detected in the putative promoters of the two pseudogenes, and no polyadenylation signal was found in their 3′-non-coding region. In contrast, the IFN-α13 sequence contains a TATA box and a polyadenylation signal aligning with those of other IFN genes. In contrast to all of the IFN-α genes sequenced so far, the nucleotide sequence preceding the AUG codon of IFN-α13 does not match the optimal Kozak consensus. In particular, the nucleotide in position –3 is a T, whereas it would be expected to be a purine. None of the three genes possesses the consensus AU-rich elements (ARE) sequence dictating mRNA degradation that is found in some of the other IFN-α sequences (Fig. 1C) (41Bakheet T. Frevel M. Williams B.R. Greer W. Khabar K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar).Expression of IFN-α Subtypes in L929 Cells—To determine the conditions in which IFN-α13 and the two pseudogenes are expressed, we compared the proportions of the different IFN-α subtypes transcribed in infected and uninfected L929 cells (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Relative expression of IFN-α subtypes in infected and uninfected, primed or unprimed L929 cells. Histograms show the percentage of expressed IFN-α subtypes identified by the RT-PCR-cloning-sequencing procedure. A–E, L929 cells were left uninfected (C) or were infected with either the wild-type (WT) KJ6 virus (A and D) or the l-mutant TM659 virus (Lcys) (B and E). Infections were performed on naive cells (A and B) or on cells primed for 24 h with a cell culture supernatant containing IFN-α and IFN-β (D and E). RNA was extracted from cells 7 h after infection. Total IFN-α RNA was amplified by RT-PCR with consensus primers and cloned. A number (n) of individual clones were sequenced to identify the proportion of the different IFN-α subtypes expressed. Only the six IFN subtypes shown on the graph were found to be expressed in the various conditions used in this experiment. Note that the graphs do not show the level of IFN-α expression but the relative proportion of the expressed IFN subtypes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In L929 cells infected with the virus expressing the wild-type L protein (Fig. 2A), no “classical” IFN subtype transcript was detected from the 66 clones sequenced, in agreement with the reported inhibition of immediate-early IFN production by the leader protein. 87% of the transcripts corresponded to IFN-α13, and 13% corresponded to IFN-α(ψ3). In cells infected with the Lcys mutant virus (Fig. 2B), IFN-α13 and IFN-a(ψ3) transcripts were the most abundant (52.2 and 33.3%, respectively) but transcripts corresponding to IFN-α4, IFN-α5, or IFN-α6 were also detected (7.2, 2.9, and 2.9%, respectively).Interestingly, IFN-α13 and IFN-a(ψ3) transcripts were found in similar proportions in uninfected cells (Fig. 2C) and in cells infected with the wild-type virus (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the IFNs produced in the presence of the leader protein corresponded to constitutively expressed IFNs.We next analyzed the profile of IFN-α subtypes expressed in cells primed with IFN-α/β to evaluate the influence of IRF-7 activation on the transcription of these genes (Figs. 2 and 3). RT-PCR analysis confirmed transcriptional activation of IRF-7 in response to priming (Fig. 3). In unprimed cells, IFN-α4 and IFN-β but not IFN-α13 were repressed by the virus expressing the wild-type L protein. In primed cells, IFN expression with the exception of IFN-α13 was highly induced by infection with either the wild-type or the mutant virus, showing that the presence of IRF-7 overrides the inhibition of IFN production by the leader protein. The proportion of the different IFN-α subtypes expressed in primed cells was examined (Fig. 2, D and E). Following IRF-7 induction, a panel of classical IFN-α subtypes was expressed. IFN-α4 was the predominant subtype induced in primed cells following infection with both the wild-type and the l-mutant viruses. The proportion of IFN-α13 or of IFN pseudogenes transcripts strongly decreased after priming, showing that these genes are unresponsive to IRF-7 contrary to the other IFN-α subtype genes.Fig. 3IFN-α13 expression is independent of IRF-7 induction. L929 cells, either unprimed or primed for 24 h with IFN-α/β, were infected with virus KJ6 expressing the wild-type L protein (WT) with virus TM659 expressing the mutant L protein (Lcys) or were left uninfected (–). RT-PCR was performed 7 h after infection to detect IRF-7, total IFN-α, and specific IFN subtype mRNA. Viral RNA and β-actin mRNA were amplified as controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Constitutive Activity of the IFN-α13 and IFN-α(ψ2) Promoters—Promoter activity of the IFN-α13 and IFN-α(ψ2) genes was compared with that of other known type-I IFN promoters (IFN-α4, IFN-α5, and IFN-β) by using a luciferase reporter assay in BALB/3T3 fibroblasts.In uninfected cells, IFN-α13 and IFN-α(ψ2) promoters did not show any activity above base line compared with a promoterless control (data not shown), suggesting very low constitutive expression of these promoters.To evaluate virus inducibility of the promoters, luciferase activity was measured 24 h after infection with either wild-type or mutant viruses (Fig. 4A). IFN-α4 promoter activity increased at least 10-fold when the cells were infected with the Lcys virus but not with the wild-type virus, encoding a functional leader peptide. The mutant virus also induced the transcription from the IFN-α5 and the IFN-β promoters more than the wild-type virus did. However, the activation of these promoters was of lower magnitude (2–4-fold), possibly because these promoters had a higher basal transcription rate than the IFN-α4 promoter in uninfected cells.

Time-resolved phosphorescence anisotropy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer were used to investigate the organization of endogenous LHRs in porcine follicular membranes in two distinct signaling states, active and desensitized. Desensitized LHRs exhibited ∼3-fold slower rotational correlation times compared with active LHRs (59 ± 4 and 21 ± 9 μs, respectively), suggesting that with agonist-dependent desensitization the receptors are organized into larger protein complexes. Incubation of membranes with inhibitors of LHR desensitization, such as neutralizing anti-arrestin antibodies, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the third intracellular loop of the LHR but not the corresponding scrambled peptide, or catalytically inactive ARNO, resulted in faster rotational diffusion times equivalent to those of actively signaling LHRs. Furthermore, desensitized LHRs exhibited a 2.4-fold increase in fluorescence resonance energy transfer between LHRs suggesting that the larger protein aggregates formed during desensitization contain more self-associated LHRs. These results indicate that agonist-dependent LHR desensitization precedes organization of LHRs at the cells surface into larger protein aggregates.

Mills T.M. Lemaire W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 304: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Mechanisms involved in signal transduction by the LHR are of considerable interest because of the importance of the receptors in mammalian reproduction. In females, activation of the LHR regulates terminal follicular development and promotes ovulation and during pregnancy maintains progesterone production by the corpus luteum (2Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Tsuchiya M. Chang P.P. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 268: 8213-8219Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In males, LHR signaling promotes testosterone production by Leydig cells (2Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Tsuchiya M. Chang P.P. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 268: 8213-8219Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Signal transduction by the LHR to Gs can be tempered or desensitized as a consequence of arrestin2 (β-arrestin1) binding to the receptor at the third intracellular (3i) loop (3Mukherjee S. Palczewski K. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Banga J.P. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). LHR desensitization occurs in ovarian follicles in response to the mid-cycle LH surge that promotes ovulation (4Hunzicker-Dunn M. Birnbaumer L. Endocrinology. 1976; 99: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and, based on serum progesterone levels, appears to occur in human corpora lutea in response to elevated levels of hCG during pregnancy (5Yoshimi T. Strott C.A. Marshall J.R. Lipsett M.B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1969; 29: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The β2-adrenergic receptor has served as a model for desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Following agonist activation, desensitization of the β2-adrenergic receptor is triggered by receptor phosphorylation catalyzed by a G-protein receptor kinase (6Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 7Ferguson S.S.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). The G-protein receptor kinase phosphorylation sites on the β2-adrenergic receptor facilitate interaction of the receptor with non-visual arrestins (8Lohse M.J. Andexinger S. Pitcher J. Trukawinski S. Codina J. Faure J.-P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8558-8564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Arrestins sterically hinder the ability of the receptor to activate G-proteins and thus moderate signal transduction by GPCRs (9Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); therefore, LHR desensitization is expected to involve other sorts of physical interactions with arrestin molecules. Consistent with this notion, we have shown recently that both recombinant visual arrestin1 and arrestin2 but not arrestin3 (β-arrestin2) bind with high affinity to a synthetic (unphosphorylated) peptide corresponding to the 3i loop of the receptor and promote LHR desensitization (18Mukherjee S. Gurevich V.V. Preninger A. Hamm H.E. Bader M.F. Fazleabas A.T. Birnbaumer L. Hunzicker-Dunn M. J. Biol.

Our recent data, using plasma membrane models of endogenously as well as heterologously expressed LHRs (18Mukherjee S. Gurevich V.V. Preninger A. Hamm H.E. Bader M.F. Fazleabas A.T. Birnbaumer L.

ADP-ribosylation factor 6 activation results in the release from a plasma membrane docking site of a pool of arrestin2, which then binds to the active LHR, promoting receptor desensitization (19Mukherjee S. Gurevich V.V. Jones J.C.R. Casanova J.E. Frank S.R. Maizels E.T. Bader M.-F. Kahn R.A. Palczewski K. Aktories K. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Activation of this cascade by the ADP-ribosylation factor 6 activator ARNO also promotes LHR desensitization (19Mukherjee S. Gurevich V.V. Jones J.C.R. Casanova J.E. Frank S.R. Maizels E.T.

Similarly, inhibition of these reactions by catalytically inactive ARNO (21Mukherjee S. Casanova J.E. Hunzicker-Dunn M. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12984-12989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) blocks LHR desensitization. Both the extent and rate of LHR desensitization in our membrane model are facilitated by incubation of membranes with 8% ethanol (23Ekstrom R.C. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2578-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We considered that ethanol most likely encouraged LHR desensitization by increasing the fluidity of the membrane and therefore the mobility of proteins and lipids in the membrane. We therefore tested the hypothesis that LHR desensitization required the formation of protein aggregates that contained self-associated LHRs. This hypothesis was supported by abundant evidence that the LHR, upon agonist binding, can form large protein aggregates (24Luborsky J.L. Slater W.T. Beheman H.R.

Utilizing a plasma membrane model of endogenously expressed receptors present in preovulatory follicles under conditions in which LHRs are “locked” in an active conformation and do not proceed to desensitization versus conditions in which LHRs become desensitized, we compared the aggregation state of the LHR when the receptor is active versus when the receptor is desensitized. Results indicate that agonist-dependent desensitization of endogenous LHRs in a plasma membrane model precedes, and is obligatory for, organization of LHRs into larger protein aggregates and that these protein aggregates contain self-associated LHRs. Preparation of Porcine Follicle Membranes—A membrane fraction enriched in adenylyl cyclase activity was isolated from preovulatorysized porcine ovarian follicles and stored at –70 °C (14Ekstrom R.C. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Membranes (100 μg of membrane protein) were incubated, unless otherwise indicated, for 40 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 40 μl in the presence of 25 mm Bis-tris propane, pH 7.2, 0.4 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 20 mm phosphocreatine, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm cAMP, and either 1 mm ATP plus 10 μm GTP (+GTP) or 1 mm AMP-PNP (–GTP) in the presence of 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin or hCG in 8% ethanol, as indicated. Membranes were then diluted to 1 ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, and pelleted by centrifuging for 10 min at 10,000 × g. Membrane pellets were then incubated at 4 °Cin100 μl of Hank's balanced salt solution, pH 2.7, for 2 min to strip hCG off the receptor, the reaction mixture was neutralized with 2 m Tris base, and membranes were repelleted and frozen at –70 °C. Membranes were then labeled with erythrosin isothiocyanate (ErITC) or tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TrITC) as described below. The source of reagents is as described previously (3Mukherjee S. Palczewski K. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Banga J.P. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Preparation of ErITC- and TrITC-derivatized hCG—Hormones were derivatized with ErITC or TrITC using a modification of methods described by Johnson and Holborow (32Johnson G.D. Holborow E.J. Weir D.M. Handbook of Experimental Immunology. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Boston1986Google Scholar) that has been described in detail previously (28Philpott C.J. Rahman N.A. Kenny N. Barisas B.G. Roess D.A. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 53: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The molar ratios for hCG derivatized with ErITC and TrITC and the concentration of protein in solution were determined spectrophotometrically. The hormone preparations used in these experiments had 1.2 mol of ErITC and of TrITC per mol of hCG. It has been previously shown that there is no effect of fluorophore conjugation on hormone biological activity (28Philpott C.J. Rahman N.A. Kenny N. Barisas B.G. Roess D.A. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 53: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Prior to use, fluorophore-derivatized proteins were centrifuged at 130,000 × g for 5 min in a Beckman Airfuge (Beckman Instruments) to remove any protein aggregates that may have formed during storage at 4 °C. Labeling Membranes with ErITC- and TrITC-derivatized hCG—Typically, 100 μg of porcine ovarian membrane proteins were suspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and labeled with 10 nm ErITC- or TrITC-hCG at 37 °C for 30 min for each experiment. Membranes were then washed two times by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline to remove unbound ligand. To verify that there were no nonspecific interactions between the membranes and the ErITC-hCG, some membranes were left untreated whereas other membranes were preincubated with excess hCG prior to labeling with the respective ErITC-derivatized hCG in some experiments. In both cases, there was no phosphorescence signal detected using the TPA apparatus described below. TPA Measurements—After labeling with ErITC-derivatized hCG, plasma membrane preparations were deoxygenated for 15 min by purging with argon gas to eliminate phosphorescence quenching caused by O2. The sample was then placed in a 5-mm Suprasil quartz cuvette (Helma Cells, Inc., Jamaica, NY) and inserted into a thermostated cuvette holder maintained at room temperature. The frequency-doubled 532 nm output of a Spectra-Physics DCR-11 Nd:YAG laser (Spectra-Physics, Albuquerque, NM) provided the excitation pulse for each experiment. The laser was operated at 10 Hz with a vertically polarized radially symmetric Gaussian transverse electromagnetic mode output of 0.19 mJ and a beam 1/e2 radius of 3.6 mm. Beam diameter was restricted to 2.5 mm at the sample. Phosphorescence emission from the sample was collected at 90° to the excitation axis and isolated with a 1-cm path length of 1 m Na2Cr2O7 solution, a KV 550 color filter (Schott Glass Technologies, Inc., Duryea, PA), and a 3-mm-thick RG 665 filter. A rotating polarizer was placed in front of the photomultiplier tube to observe the intensity of phosphorescence with polarization parallel to and perpendicular to the exciting pulse. The phosphorescence signal was collected by a thermionically cooled EMI 9816A photomultiplier tube. A fast gating circuit was used to turn the photomultiplier tube off during the high power Nd:YAG pulses (21Mukherjee S. Casanova J.E. Hunzicker-Dunn M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6524-6528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The output signal from the photomultiplier tube was amplified by a Tektronix 476 oscilloscope. The oscilloscope was further amplified by a 35-MHz bandwidth buffer amplifier and fed to a Nicolet 12/70 signal averager equipped with a 20-MHz analog-to-digital converter. Phosphorescence decay traces from 4096 laser pulses were averaged for each polarizer orientation, the channel width being 0.5 μs. After data acquisition was complete, data were downloaded for analysis and storage. Total phosphorescence emission was analyzed according to a multi-exponential decay model, and an apparent half-time for phosphorescence decay was calculated. Analysis of anisotropy decay yielded the initial anisotropy value R 0, the limiting anisotropy value R ∞, and the rotational correlation time as well as the statistical uncertainties in these quantities (33Bevington P.R. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw Hill Book Co., New York1969Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy—Following membrane incubations to yield active or desensitized LHRs, removal of bound hCG, and binding TrITC-hCG to receptors, membranes were resuspended in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. The entire sample was placed in a quartz well slide, and the well was overlaid with a “00” glass coverslip and subjected to confocal microscopy with a Sarastro 2000 confocal microscope (standard TrITC filter set, aperture of 50 μm, laser power of 25 milliwatts, PMT voltage of 600 V, and magnification of 2000). FRET Measurements—FRET between FITC- and TrITC-derivatized hCG was evaluated based on the reduced rate of irreversible photobleaching of FITC fluorophores when TrITC fluorophores were present within less than ∼100 Å, as previously described (30Roess D.A. Horvat R.D. Munnelly H. Barisas B.G. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4518-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For each treatment, data were collected from 20 membrane smears in which receptors were labeled with 0.5 μm FITC-hCG or 1.5 μm TrITC or with 0.5 μm FITC-hCG and 1.5 μm TrITC. Each sample was photobleached for 10 s during which time fluorescence emission was collected at 0.01-s intervals. Individual data traces were analyzed to yield the energy transfer efficiency (% E) for each treatment (34Young R.M. Arnette J.K. Roess D.A. Barisas B.G. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 881-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Statistics—Results were analyzed using Student's t test to determine statistical significance (35Bender F.E. Douglass L.W. Kramer A. Statistical methods for Food and Agriculture. AVI Publishing Co., Inc., Westport, CT1982Google Scholar) between treatments. LHR Rotational Diffusion Time Slows with LHR Desensitization—We showed previously, using an adenylyl cyclase-enriched membrane fraction from porcine ovarian follicles, that LHR desensitization exhibits an absolute requirement for GTP (13Ekstrom R.C. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2470-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 14Ekstrom R.C. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, incubation of membranes with hCG but without GTP (+hCG–GTP) yields an active receptor which does not desensitize, whereas incubation with hCG plus GTP (+hCG + GTP) leads to receptor desensitization. Using the biophysical technique of time-resolved phosphorescence anisotropy (TPA), we measured the rotational diffusion of the LHR when it can actively transduce a cAMP response (membranes +hCG–GTP) versus when the receptor is desensitized (membranes + hCG + GTP). Following membrane incubations to generate active versus desensitized receptors, hCG was removed from the receptor by a low pH wash. Receptor was then bound with ErITC-derivatized hCG (in the absence of GTP) for rotational diffusion measurements of active and desensitized LHR. (Rotational diffusion of the inactive LHR could not be evaluated because LHRs were tagged with fluorescently labeled hCG.) We showed previously that once desensitized, the LHR remains stably desensitized (in the absence of GTP) for at least 40 min (36Ekstrom R.C. Carney E.M. Lamm M.L.G. Hunzicker-Dunn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22183-22189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Table I shows the initial anisotropy values R 0 and the limiting anisotropy values R ∞ of active and desensitized LHRs obtained from raw data traces for a single experiment. Analysis of the anisotropic decay yields the rotational correlation time, which is a direct measurement of the in-membrane volume of the rotating protein complex. In general, the larger the complex the slower the rotational correlation time. The average rotational correlation time over five separate experimental days, each day involving four TPA measurements per sample, is shown in Fig. 1. Taken together, these results show that active LHRs exhibit a faster anisotropic decay and rotational correlation time than desensitized receptors. Desensitized LHRs therefore occupy a larger in-membrane volume than active receptors and are rotating more slowly than active LHRs. Consistent with this conclusion, the percent mobility (% M) of desensitized LHRs, as shown in Table I, is significantly (p < 0.05) reduced as compared with active LHRs. These results suggest that desensitized LHRs are located in protein complexes that are significantly larger than those containing active LHRs. Thus, LHR desensitization appears to result in the formation of larger protein aggregates.Table IInitial and limiting anisotropy values and percent mobility of active and desensitized LHRMembrane treatmentReceptor → GsR 0aResults of R 0 versus R ∞, p < 0.05 for active versus desensitized LHR.R ∞aResults of R 0 versus R ∞, p < 0.05 for active versus desensitized LHR.% Mb% M, percent mobility of LHR.

Open table in a new tab LHR Aggregation under Desensitization Conditions Is Visible by Confocal Microscopy—To confirm that LHR aggregation increases with LHR desensitization, we visualized both active and desensitized LHR by labeling the receptor, following formation of active versus desensitized LHRs in the follicular membrane model, with fluorescent (TrITC)-hCG and monitoring the fluorescence at 560 nm by confocal microscopy. Results (Fig. 2) showed that the active LHR is organized into small fluorescent patches in porcine follicular membranes whereas larger fluorescent aggregates are visible for the desensitized LHR. LHR Rotational Diffusion Slows within 10 Min of Agonist Addition—To determine the time dependence of the reduction in rotational diffusion and formation of larger LHR aggregates, we measured the rotational diffusion of the LHR at 10-min intervals for 40 min in membranes incubated under conditions that do or do not promote LHR desensitization. We previously reported that LHRs in porcine follicle membranes are 80% desensitized within 10 min after agonist addition (23Ekstrom R.C. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2578-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore, if receptor incorporation into larger protein complexes occurs prior to or coincident with desensitization, rotational correlation times should be slowed by 10 min. Results (Fig. 3) show that rotational correlation times for the LHR are slowed to 76 ± 20 μs by 10 min after agonist addition and remain slow for the next 30 min. These data suggest that formation of LHR aggregates is occurring with the same rapid time course as LHR desensitization. It is not apparent from these studies, however, whether LHR desensitization is required for or a consequence of LHR aggregation. Complex Formation Can Be Blocked Using Antibodies, Proteins, or Peptide Sequences That Prevent LHR Desensitization—To determine whether LHR desensitization is necessary for receptor aggregation, we examined the rotational diffusion of the receptor when desensitization was inhibited. If desensitization is obligatory for LHR aggregation into larger protein complexes, we hypothesized that inhibiting desensitization should prevent LHR aggregation and result in comparatively fast rotational correlation times. Conversely, if desensitization occurs as a result of receptor aggregation, then inhibiting desensitization should not perturb the formation of LHR complexes and should produce long rotational correlation times indicative of receptor inclusion in large complexes. We have previously shown that incubating membranes with various proteins or peptides that specifically block either the binding to or availability of arrestin2 to the LHR (3Mukherjee S. Palczewski K.

These reagents which block LHR desensitization include neutralizing anti-arrestin antibodies, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 3i loop of the LHR, and catalytically inactive (E156K) ARNO. As shown in Fig. 4, pretreatment of membranes with anti-arrestin antibodies (lane 6), the synthetic 3i peptide (lane 8), or catalytically inactive E156K ARNO (lane 14) followed by treatment with hCG and GTP led to faster rotational diffusion of the LHR. Rotational correlation times of these LHRs treated with hCG and GTP (lanes 6, 8, and 14) were not significantly different (p > 0.05) from those of the active receptor (lane 1) treated with hCG in the absence of GTP. In contrast, the rotational diffusion of the LHR was slow when the LHR was desensitized (3Mukherjee S. Palczewski K. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Banga J.P. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

These results suggest that inclusion of the LHR in comparatively large complexes exhibiting slow rotational diffusion is dependent on LHR desensitization. FRET of Active and Desensitized LHRs—Although time-resolved phosphorescence anisotropy measurements of hormone-occupied LHR indicate that desensitized LHRs are present in larger, slower rotating complexes than are active LHRs, it is not possible to resolve from these measurements whether complexes exhibiting slower rotational diffusion contain LHR monomers bound to accessory proteins such as arrestin2 or receptor dimers or larger oligomers bound to accessory proteins. In the absence of a functional cytoskeleton, it is unlikely that slow rotational diffusion of the desensitized receptor is a result of interaction of the receptor with cytoskeletal components. To distinguish between LH monomers or larger aggregates of LHR, we evaluated the FRET between FITC- and TrITC-derivatized hCG bound to active or to desensitized LHRs. In samples where receptors are labeled with either FITC-hCG alone or both FITC- and TrITC-hCG, slower rates of FITC fluorescence decay between FITC-hCG- and TrITC-hCG-labeled receptors compared with only FITC-hCG-labeled receptors reflects the efficiency of energy transfer and can be quantitated"

Here, we show that PLCγ2 deficiency specifically blocks B cell maturation at the transitional type 2 (T2) to follicular (FO) B cell transition and the PLCγ2 pathway regulates survival of B cells. BCR-induced apoptosis is dramatically enhanced in all subsets of splenic PLCγ2-deficient B cells, especially in T2 and FO B cell subpopulations. We also find that all splenic PLCγ2-deficient B cell subpopulations express abnormally low levels of Bcl-2 protein. In addition, PLCγ2 deficiency disrupts BCR-mediated induction of A1 expression. Enforced expression of Bcl-2 prevents BCR-induced apoptosis in all splenic PLCγ2-deficient B cell subpopulations and partially restores the numbers of PLCγ2-deficient FO B cells. In contrast to Bcl-2, enforced expression of A1 preferentially prevents BCR-induced apoptosis in PLCγ2-deficient FO B cells and partially restores the numbers of these B cells. Therefore, the PLCγ2 pathway provides a survival signal via regulation of Bcl-2 in all splenic B cell subpopulations and via additional induction of A1 in mature FO B cells.

Immature B cells from the bone marrow emerge into the spleen as transitional B cells of type 1 (T1). 1The abbreviations used are: T1, transitional type 1; T2, transitional type 2; FO, follicular; BCR, B cell receptor; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PE, phycoerythrin; PLC, phospholipase C; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. T1 B cells develop into transitional B cells of type 2 (T2). Ultimately, T2 B cells give rise to two subsets of long lived mature B cells, called follicular (FO) B cells and marginal zone (MZ) B cells (1Loder F. Mutschler B. Ray R.J. Paige C.J. Sideras P.

In addition, the BCR provides a survival signal to maintain the long lived mature B cells in the periphery, with inducible ablation of BCR expression in mice leading to rapid loss of mature B cells (10Lam K.P. Kuhn R. Rajewsky K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1073-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). In addition to providing a survival signal, the BCR can also initiate apoptosis. In immature B cells, binding of self-antigens to surface IgM induces cell apoptosis, thus enabling negative selection to remove self-reactive cells (11Hartley S.B. Crosbie J. Brink R. Kantor A.B. Basten A. Goodnow C.C. Nature. 1991; 353: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 12Mason D.Y. Jones M. Goodnow C.C. Int.

Ultimately, BCR-bearing immature B cells that survive the negative selection process emerge into the periphery and continue the maturation process in the spleen. Moreover, hypercross-linking of the BCR triggers apoptosis in mature B cells to down-regulate the immune response and maintain homeostasis (15Pulendran B. Kannourakis G. Nouri S. Smith K.G. Nossal G.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 16Shokat K.M. Goodnow C.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 17Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6275) Google Scholar). Therefore, highly regulated B cell apoptosis plays a critical role in B cell development, in the depletion of self-reactive cells, in the down-regulation of immune responses, and in maintenance of the long lived mature B cells. The intracellular pathways from the BCR that regulate B cell survival and apoptosis are not fully understood. The BCR is associated with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing transmembrane molecules, Igα and Igβ, to transduce signals (18Kurosaki T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Three distinct types of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases, Src kinases (Lyn, Blk, and Fyn), Btk, and Syk, are involved in BCR signaling (18Kurosaki T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In addition, the adapter protein, B cell linker protein (BLNK), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) are included in the signaling cascade. Tyrosine-phosphorylated BLNK and membrane phospholipids modified by PI3K are essential for recruiting down-stream signaling molecules, including PLCγ (18Kurosaki T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The importance of these signaling molecules in BCR signaling has been illustrated by gene-targeted disruption studies. Lyn-deficient mice have an impairment in late B cell development (19Nishizumi H. Taniuchi I. Yamanashi Y. Kitamura D. Ilic D. Mori S. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T.

Immunity. 1997; 7: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Syk-deficient mice have a blockade in early B cell development at the pro-B to pre-B cell transition (21Turner M. Mee P.J. Costello P.S. Williams O. Price A.A. Duddy L.P. Furlong M.T. Geahlen R.L.

Importantly, deficiencies of these molecules all result in increased BCR-induced apoptosis (27Pogue S.L. Kurosaki T. Bolen J. Herbst R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1300-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 28Anderson J.S. Teutsch M. Dong Z. Wortis H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 20055-20063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the mechanism by which the BCR regulates B cell apoptosis via these molecules is not clear. The initial signaling cascade activated by the BCR ultimately leads to activation of several pathways, including that of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ). PLCγ has two isoforms, γ1 and γ2. In B cells, PLCγ2 is the predominant PLCγ isoform, and it is activated by BCR engagement (30Takata M. Homma Y. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 31Coggeshall K.M. McHugh J.C. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5660-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Upon activation, PLCγ2 hydrolyzes PIP2 to generate diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol phosphates including inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) (32Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC) and IP3 mediates calcium mobilization from internal calcium stores. The elevated intracellular Ca2+ concentration leads to activation of the phosphatase, calcineurin (32Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The important physiological role of PLCγ2 has been elucidated by our recent studies of PLCγ2-deficient mice (33Wang D. Feng J. Wen R. Marine J.C. Sangster M.Y. Parganas E. Hoffmeyer A. Jackson C.W. Cleveland J.L. Murray P.J. Ihle J.N. Immunity. 2000; 13: 25-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Disruption of the PLCγ2 gene leads to a number of defects in signaling through the BCR (33Wang D. Feng J. Wen R. Marine J.C. Sangster M.Y. Parganas E. Hoffmeyer A. Jackson C.W. Cleveland J.L. Murray P.J. Ihle J.N. Immunity. 2000; 13: 25-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The mutant mice have profoundly impaired late B cell development at the immature to mature B cell transition and disrupted B cell function, resulting in xid-like immunodeficiency. However, the mechanism by which the PLCγ2 pathway could regulate the B cell development is unknown. We show here that the PLCγ2 pathway provides essential signals for the T2 to FO B cell transition and regulates cell survival. PLCγ2 regulates cell survival of different splenic subpopulations via distinct anti-apoptotic molecules, Bcl-2 and A1. Flow Cytometry—Spleen and bone marrow cells were made into single cell suspensions in PBS supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin. The cells were then stained with a mixture of mAbs conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), phycoerythrin (PE), Cychrome, or biotin. The stained cells were analyzed in a BD Biosciences FACScan in three-color mode using CellQuest™ software. FITC-conjugated anti-IgD, FITC-conjugated CD21, PE-conjugated anti-CD43, PE-conjugated, or Cy-chrome-conjugated anti-B220, and biotin-conjugated CD23 were all purchased from Pharmingen, San Diego, CA. Both FITC- and PE-conjugated anti-IgM antibodies were purchased from Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL. Total Splenic B Cell Purification—Single cell suspensions of splenocytes from wild-type or mutant mice were treated with Gey's solution to lyse red blood cells and were stained with PE-conjugated anti-B220 antibodies. B220 positive B cells were purified by FACS sorting. The resulting purified B cells were suspended in medium consisting of RPMI 1640, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 5 × 10-5m 2-mercaptoethnol, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine (all from Invitrogen), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone). FACS Analyses of Bcl-2 Expression—FACS analysis of Bcl-2 expression was performed as described previously (34Wen R. Wang D. McKay C. Bunting K.D. Marine J.C. Vanin E.F. Zambetti G.P. Korsmeyer S.J. Ihle J.N. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 678-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, single cell suspensions of splenocytes were prepared and stained with FITC-conjugated anti-IgM antibody and Cychrome-conjugated anti-IgD antibody (BD PharMingen) at 4 °C for 30 min. Then, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed on ice for 15 min in 1% paraformaldehyde (Ted Pella, Inc.). Afterward, the cells were washed once with PBS and incubated with a hamster anti-Bcl-2 antibody (15021A; BD PharMingen) in PBS-5% bovine serum albumin-0.05% saponin (Sigma). The cells were washed twice, followed by incubation with PE-conjugated anti-hamster (Southern Biotechnology Inc.) on ice for 30 min. Then, the cells were washed and analyzed by FACScan (BD PharMingen). Bcl-2-null spleens have demonstrated the specificity of the anti-Bcl-2 antibody (34Wen R. Wang D. McKay C. Bunting K.D. Marine J.C. Vanin E.F. Zambetti G.P. Korsmeyer S.J. Ihle J.N. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 678-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Isotype-matched control antibodies, purified hamster IgG (BD PharMingen) served as negative controls. Western Blotting—For immunoblots of Bcl-2, purified B cells (5 × 106) were stimulated with anti-IgM antibody (10 μg/ml) for 2, 6, and 10 h. Cells were collected, washed once in PBS, and cell pellets were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen pellets were lysed on ice in RIPA buffer-containing protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin, aprotinin, leupeptin). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation and immediately boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. 40 μg of whole cell extracts were used to perform immunoblots. Antibodies used included anti-mouse Bcl-2 (15021, BD PharMingen) and anti-actin (Roche Applied Science). FACS Analysis of Apoptosis (TUNEL)—The total splenic B cells or subsets of splenic B cells, purified by FACS sorting, were stimulated with anti-IgM at 10 μg/ml. At different time points, cells were collected for TUNEL-based apoptosis analysis. Collected cells were fixed, permeabilized, and labeled according to the manufacturer's instructions (In Situ Cell Death Detection kit, Roche Applied Science). After washing, the cells were analyzed by FACScan. Semiquantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Purified total splenic B cells (5 × 106) were stimulated with anti-IgM antibody (10 μg/ml) for 2, 6, and 10 h. Total RNA was prepared from cells by RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Inc) and first-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA with the Gene Amp RT-PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed to analyze A1 and actin gene expression using the following primers: A1, forward TGCCAGGGAAGATGGCTGAG and reverse TCCGTAGTGTTACTTGAGGAG; actin, forward ACTCCTATGTGGGTGACGAG and reverse CAGGTCCAGACGCAGGATGGC. Actin was used as a RNA level control. Retroviral Transduction and Bone Marrow Transplantation—The human Bcl-2 gene or rat PLCγ2 gene were cloned into a bicistronic retrovirus MSCV-IRES-GFP (MSCV-I-GFP) vector (35Bunting K.D. Sangster M.Y. Ihle J.N. Sorrentino B.P. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The expression of the cloned gene and GFP is under control of the murine stem cell promoter (MSCV). GFP serves as a marker for the identification of retrovirally transduced cells. Conditioned media containing high titer, amphotropic retrovirus particles were derived by cotransfection of 293T cells with the retrovirus vector expressing the cloned gene and GFP and a helper plasmid, pEQPAM3, containing the required gag, pol, and env retroviral genes driven by a Moloney leukemia virus LTR. These media were filtered and used to transduce ecotropic packaging cells GP+E86 with 6 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma) a total of six times over 3 days. The highest expressing GFP cells were sorted under sterile conditions and subsequently expanded as virus-producing cells. Murine bone marrow cells were transduced by retrovirus as follows: PLCγ2-deficient mice (8–12 weeks old) were injected intraperitoneally with 150 mg/kg of 5-fluorouracil 48 h before bone marrow harvest. Bone marrow was isolated from both hind limbs and pre-stimulated with 20 ng/ml murine IL3, 50 ng/ml human IL6 and 50 ng/ml rat stem cell factor (SCF) for 48 h. Cells were then co-cultured on irradiated ecotropic producer cells (GP+E86) in the presence of IL3, IL6, SCF and polybrene (6 μg/ml). After 48 h, 2 to 5 × 106 nucleated bone marrow cells were injected via tail vein injection into sublethally irradiated recipient JAK3-deficient mice (900 rads). Four weeks later, the development of B cells was analyzed through FACS and functions of B cells from the peripheral blood and spleen in bone marrow transplanted mice were examined. PLCγ2 Deficiency Specifically Blocks B Cell Maturation at the T2 to FO B Cell Transition—One of the most prominent defects in PLCγ2-deficient B cells is failure in the development of the most mature B cell population (B220+IgMlow) (33Wang D. Feng J. Wen R. Marine J.C. Sangster M.Y. Parganas E. Hoffmeyer A. Jackson C.W. Cleveland J.L. Murray P.J. Ihle J.N. Immunity. 2000; 13: 25-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In this report, we more precisely defined the stage at which B cell maturation was blocked by PLCγ2 deficiency. Splenocytes can be stained with anti-IgM, anti-CD21, and anti-CD23 and separated into CD23+ and CD23- cells to define the different B cell subsets of newly formed immature B cells (36Oliver A.M. Martin F. Gartland G.L. Carter R.H. Kearney J.F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2366-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). CD23+ cells include CD21highIgMhigh T2 B cells and CD21intIgMlow mature FO B cells. CD23- B cells include CD21lowIgMhigh T1 B cells and CD21highIgMhigh MZ B cells. PLCγ2-deficient mice had dramatically decreased FO B cells (CD23+CD21intIgMlow) and slightly increased T2 B cells (CD23+CD21highIgMhigh) in both percentages and absolute numbers relative to wild-type mice (Fig. 1A and Table I). In contrast, PLCγ2-deficient and wild-type mice had comparable percentages and numbers of T1 (CD23-CD21lowIgMhigh) and MZ (CD23-CD21highIgMhigh) B cells (Fig. 1A and Table I). Based on expression of IgD and IgM, splenocytes can be separated into IgMhighIgD- (T1), IgMhigh IgDhigh (T2), and IgMlowIgDhigh (FO) B cells (1Loder F. Mutschler B. Ray R.J. Paige C.J. Sideras P. Torres R. Lamers M.C. Carsetti R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 75-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Splenocytes derived from PLCγ2-deficient mice had significant reduction of IgMlowIgDhigh FO mature B cells relative to those derived from wild-type mice (Fig. 1B), consistent with the CD21/CD23/IgM-staining results (Fig. 1A). Therefore, PLCγ2 deficiency specifically blocks B cell maturation at the T2 to FO B cell transition.Table IT1, T2, FO, and MZ B cells in wild-type and PLCγ2-deficient mice The B cell subsets were determined by staining with antibodies to IgM, D21, and CD23. The numbers of each subset B cells and their percentages in gated live lymphocytes were determined for each mouse, and the mean value and S.D. were calculated (n = 6).B cell subsets (number in millions and percentage of live lymphocyte gate)GenotypeT1T2FOMZNumberPercentNumberPercentNumberPercentNumberPercentWild-type0.9 ± 0.21.2 ± 0.44.3 ± 1.85.3 ± 1.923.6 ± 8.1aStudent's I-test: p < 0.0129.7 ± 6.1aStudent's I-test: p < 0.011.1 ± 0.41.4 ± 0.8PLCγ2-deficient0.9 ± 0.90.8 ± 0.66.6 ± 2.56.5 ± 3.07.5 ± 3.3aStudent's I-test: p < 0.017.2 ± 2.7aStudent's I-test: p < 0.011.4 ± 0.91.4 ± 0.8a Student's I-test: p < 0.01 Open table in a new tab BCR-mediated Apoptosis Is Dramatically Increased at All Stages, Especially at T2 and FO Stages, of PLCγ2-deficient B Cells—Apoptosis plays an essential role in B cell development (7Rothstein T.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Ligation of the BCR induces apoptosis in B cells, leading to elimination of self-reactive B cells during B cell development and of antigen-responsive B cells after induction of an immune response (11Hartley S.B. Crosbie J. Brink R. Kantor A.B. Basten A. Goodnow C.C. Nature. 1991; 353: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 12Mason D.Y. Jones M. Goodnow C.C. Int.

To determine the effect of PLCγ2 deficiency on BCR-induced apoptosis, purified splenic B cells derived from wild-type or PLCγ2-deficient mice were stimulated with anti-IgM, and subsequently analyzed for apoptosis by TUNEL assay. As expected, anti-IgM induced apoptosis in wild-type B cells (30% at 24 h) (14Hasbold J. Klaus G.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1685-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 37Tsubata T. Wu J. Honjo T. Nature. 1993; 364: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar); however, in PLCγ2-deficient B cells, BCR-induced apoptosis was dramatically enhanced (65% at 24 h) (Fig. 2A). Nonetheless, the enhanced BCR-induced apoptosis could be due to increased proportion of T2 B cells to mature FO B cells in the PLCγ2-deficient splenic B cell population. To exclude this possibility, we further examined BCR-induced apoptosis in FACS-sorted subsets of PLCγ2-deficient B cells. Although both wild-type and PLCγ2-deficient T1 B cells were prone to BCR-induced apoptosis, PLCγ2-deficient T1 B cells died faster (Fig. 2B). In addition, BCR-induced apoptosis was dramatically enhanced in PLCγ2-deficient T2 (79% at 24 h) and FO (50% at 24 h) B cells relative to wild-type T2 (28% at 24 h) and FO (20% at 24 h) B cells (Fig. 2B). Thus, PLCγ2 plays an important role in preventing BCR-mediated apoptosis at all stages, especially at the T2 and FO stages, of B cell maturation. PLCγ2-deficient B Cells Express Low Levels of Bcl-2 Protein—Bcl-2 family members play essential roles in maintaining cell survival during B cell development. Bcl-2-deficient mice have decreased mature B cells and B cell precursors due to enhanced apoptosis (38Nakayama K. Negishi I. Kuida K. Sawa H. Loh D.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3700-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 39Veis D.J. Sorenson C.M. Shutter J.R. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). The ability of Bcl-2 molecule to support cell survival is largely dependent on its level of expression. Therefore, Bcl-2 expression was compared in wild-type and PLCγ2-deficient T1 (IgMhighIgD-), T2 (IgMhighIgDhigh), and FO (IgMlowIgDhigh) B cells by intracellular staining with Bcl-2-specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3A, the level of Bcl-2 protein was significantly decreased in all three PLCγ2-deficient splenic subpopulations relative to their wild-type counterparts whereas Bcl-2 levels were similar in both wild-type and PLCγ2-deficient IgM-IgD- lymphocytes (mainly T lymphocytes) (Fig. 3A). To confirm this observation and to test whether the expression of Bcl-2 family members is dependent upon PLCγ2 activation, we assessed the level of Bcl-2 protein in wild-type and PLCγ2-deficient B cells before and after BCR engagement by Western blot analysis. The level of Bcl-2 protein was obviously decreased in PLCγ2-deficient B cells compared with wild-type B cells without BCR engagement (Fig. 3B), consistent with the intracellular-staining results (Fig. 3A). Strikingly, the level of Bcl-2 protein was further dramatically decreased following BCR engagement in PLCγ2-deficient B cells relative to wild-type B cells (Fig. 3B). Therefore, PLCγ2 deficiency leads to a reduction of Bcl-2 expression during B cell maturation. PLCγ2-deficient B Cells Fail to Induce A1 Expression Following BCR Ligation—The severely impaired B cell maturation of PLCγ2-deficient B cells and the relatively normal B cell maturation in Bcl-2-deficient B cells (38Nakayama K. Negishi I. Kuida K. Sawa H. Loh D.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3700-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 39Veis D.J. Sorenson C.M. Shutter J.R. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar) suggest that, in addition to maintaining Bcl-2 protein levels, PLCγ2 may regulate another anti-apoptotic molecule during B cell development. To identify additional downstream targets of PLCγ2 that regulate B cell apoptosis, we employed the non-biased DNA microarray-based expression profiling approach. Total RNA was isolated from wild-type and PLCγ2-deficient splenic B cells before and 1 h after anti-IgM stimulation. Affymetrix GeneChip Murine 19K arrays containing greater than 19,000 clustered murine EST transcripts were used to determine relative transcript levels in each of the RNA preparations. Each gene was represented in the array by 16 perfectly matched probes and 16 mismatched control probes that contain a single central-base mismatch. The average of the differences (perfect match minus mismatch) for each probe family was calculated to determine RNA abundance. A1, a prosurvival member of the Bcl-2 family (40Lin E.Y. Orlofsky A. Berger M.S. Prystowsky M.B. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1979-1988PubMed Google Scholar), was identified among a number of genes that were induced upon BCR ligation in wild-type, but not PLCγ2-deficient, B cells. Normally, A1 is rapidly induced following BCR engagement in T2 and FO mature B cells (41Su T.T. Rawlings D.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2101-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Failure of PLCγ2-deficient B cells to induce A1 expression following BCR ligation was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 4A). Therefore, induction of A1 expression following BCR engagement is dramatically impaired in PLCγ2-deficient relative to wild-type B cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that BCR-mediated induction of A1 is regulated by NF-κB transcription factors (42Grumont R.J. Rourke I.J. Gerondakis S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 400-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism by which the PLCγ2 pathway induces A1 expression is quite possibly via NF-κB transcription factors. Therefore, we examined activation of NF-κB in wild-type and PLCγ2-deficient B cells after BCR ligation. Anti-IgM stimulation dramatically induced NF-κB complex formation over background in wild-type B cells, whereas it failed to increase NF-κB complex formation in PLCγ2-deficient B cells, which had comparable levels of NF-κB complex before and after anti-IgM stimulation (Fig. 4B). A supershift with anti-p50 antibody demonstrated that the NF-κB complex contained the p50 component of NF-κB (Fig. 4B). In addition, BCR ligation induced the nuclear translocation of c-Rel in wild-type B cells but not in PLCγ2-deficient B cells (Fig. 4C). These data demonstrate that NF-κB transcription factors are downstream targets of PLCγ2. Enforced Bcl-2 Expression Promotes Survival of All Three PLCγ2-deficient Splenic Subpopulations and Partially Restores Numbers of PLCγ2-deficient Mature FO B Cells—To provide better evidence that the increased BCR-mediated apoptosis and impaired maturation of PLCγ2-deficient B cells is in part a consequence of low levels of Bcl-2, we assessed whether enforced expression of Bcl-2 could rescue survival, proliferation, and maturation of PLCγ2-deficient B cells. The Bcl-2 molecule was transduced into PLCγ2-deficient bone marrow cells using a retrovirus that also expresses GFP by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). In addition, PLCγ2-transduced PLCγ2-deficient bone marrow cells were used as a positive control in these experiments. We utilized bone marrow reconstitution (35Bunting K.D. Sangster M.Y. Ihle J.N. Sorrentino B.P. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) to efficiently transfer genes into PLCγ2-deficient bone marrow cells, because of technical difficulties in achieving a high-level of gene transfer into primary murine B cells. Retrovirally transduced, PLCγ2-deficient bone marrow cells were transplanted into sublethally irradiated JAK3-deficient mice, which lack B cells (43Nosaka T."

Therefore, it is important to define defense mechanisms that can be activated in response to damage to reduce neuronal loss. Here we report that cisplatin (CPDD), a neurotoxic anticancer drug that damages DNA, triggered apoptosis and activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway in cultured rat cortical neurons. Inhibition of ERK1/2 activation using either pharmacological inhibitors or a dominant-negative mutant of the ERK1/2 activator, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1, increased the toxicity of CPDD. Interestingly, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) antagonists reduced the ERK1/2 activation and exacerbated apoptosis in CPDD-treated neurons. Pre-treatment with CPDD increased ERK1/2 activation triggered by exogenous NMDA, suggesting that CPDD augmented NMDAR responsiveness. CPDD-enhanced response of NMDAR and CPDD-mediated ERK1/2 activation were both decreased by inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Interestingly, PARP activation did not produce ATP depletion, suggesting involvement of a non-energetic mechanism in NMDAR regulation by PARP. Finally, CPDD toxicity was reduced by brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and this protection required ERK1/2. In summary, our data identify a novel compensatory circuit in central nervous system neurons that couples the DNA injury, through PARP and NMDAR, to the defensive ERK1/2 activation.

In summary, our data identify a novel compensatory circuit in central nervous system neurons that couples the DNA injury, through PARP and NMDAR, to the defensive ERK1/2 activation. The central nervous system is exposed to damaging stimuli that may trigger neuronal death and cause serious neurological diseases (1Yuan J. Yankner B.A. Nature. 2000; 407: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). However, most neurons survive minor damages with which they are challenged during the life span of the organism. Therefore, one can expect the existence of defense mechanisms that help neurons to survive initial insult and resume proper functions after damage. Neurons receive multiple signals inhibiting cell death (2Miller F.D. Kaplan D.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1045-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). For example, neuronal survival during development is promoted by neurotrophins and neurotransmitters. The effects of these agents on survival are mediated through several signaling molecules, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) 1The abbreviations used are: ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid; KA, kynurenic acid; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; NMDAR, NMDA receptor; CPDD, cis-diaminodichloroplatinum; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; MKK1/2, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2; 3-ABA, 3-aminobenzamide; PHEN, 6(5H)-phenanthridinone; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; APV, dl-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid; NBQX, 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo(f)quinoxaline; CNQX, cyano-nitroquinoxaline; TPDD, trans-diaminodichloroplatinum; BAPTA/AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester); MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; Z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone; HA, hemagglutinin; MK-801, dizocilpine.1The abbreviations used are: ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid; KA, kynurenic acid; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; NMDAR, NMDA receptor; CPDD, cis-diaminodichloroplatinum; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; MKK1/2, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2; 3-ABA, 3-aminobenzamide; PHEN, 6(5H)-phenanthridinone; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; APV, dl-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid; NBQX, 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo(f)quinoxaline; CNQX, cyano-nitroquinoxaline; TPDD, trans-diaminodichloroplatinum; BAPTA/AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester); MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; Z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone; HA, hemagglutinin; MK-801, dizocilpine. and phoshpatidyloinositol 3-kinase (1Yuan J.

Consequently, survival signaling pathways are good candidates to contribute to the defense mechanisms in injured neurons. Glutamate is an important neurotransmitter that promotes survival. It acts through several types of receptors, including two families of ionotropic receptors, AMPA and NMDA (3Westbrook G.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). NMDA receptor (NMDAR) is required for neuronal survival during development (4Llado J. Caldero J. Ribera J. Tarabal O. Oppenheim R.W. Esquerda J.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10803-10812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ikonomidou C. Bosch F. Miksa M. Bittigau P. Vockler J. Dikranian K. Tenkova T.I. Stefovska V. Turski L. Olney J.W. Science. 1999; 283: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar). On the other hand, excessive activation of NMDA signaling produces excitotoxicity (6Olney J.W. Neurobiol. Aging. 1994; 15: 259-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, NMDAR inhibitors are used to improve the outcome of several neurological diseases (7Le D.A. Lipton S.A. Drugs Aging. 2001; 18: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been recently proposed that NMDAR antagonists may be active against malignant tumors and that their combination with anticancer chemotherapy would be a valuable therapeutic approach (8Rzeski W. Turski L. Ikonomidou C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6372-6377Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). It is intriguing that neurons, which are postmitotic cells, demonstrate high vulnerability to DNA damage (9Morris E.J. Geller H.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 757-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 10Park D.S. Morris E.J. Padmanabhan J. Shelanski M.L. Geller H.M. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Often, genotoxic anticancer agents including cisplatin (CPDD) produce neurological side effects that limit their usage against central nervous system tumors (11Keime-Guibert F. Napolitano M. Delattre J.Y. J. Neurol. 1998; 245: 695-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 12Stewart D.J. Rottenberg D.A. Neurological Complications of Cancer Treatment. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston1991: 143-170Google Scholar). DNA damage may also be an important trigger of neuron loss in common neurodegenerative diseases (13Alam Z.I. Jenner A. Daniel S.E. Lees A.J. Cairns N. Marsden C.D. Jenner P. Halliwell B. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1196-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). DNA damage activates both the reparative response and death signaling (14Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar). For example, DNA damage may mobilize poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which ribosylates target proteins to activate DNA repair (15Ha H.C. Snyder S.H. Neurobiol. Dis. 2000; 7: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The substrate of PARP is a highly energetic molecule, NAD+. In consequence, PARP activation may deplete cellular energy stores, resulting in neuronal membrane depolarization with enhanced NMDAR signaling and, finally, necrotic cell death (15Ha H.C. Snyder S.H. Neurobiol. Dis. 2000; 7: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Genotoxin-induced neuronal death can be suppressed by neurotrophins (16Zheng J.L. Stewart R.R. Gao W.Q. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5079-5087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hetman M. Kanning K. Smith-Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22569-22580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 18Anderson C.N. Tolkovsky A.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 664-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protection has been reported to require activation of the ERK1/2 pathway (17Hetman M. Kanning K. Smith-Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22569-22580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 18Anderson C.N. Tolkovsky A.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 664-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that DNA damage by CPDD can activate the ERK1/2 pathway as a defense response to support neuronal survival. Our results indicate that the CPDD-activated ERK1/2 pathway attenuates cortical neuron death. Interestingly, activation of ERK1/2 by CPDD depended on PARP and NMDAR activity and was not accompanied by decreased ATP levels. Our observations identify a novel protective pathway that couples DNA damage, through PARP and NMDAR, to ERK1/2. Our results also suggest the possibility of toxic interactions between NMDAR antagonists and genotoxic anticancer agents that reach the central nervous system. Materials—The following plasmids have been described elsewhere: pON260 (19Cherrington J.M. Mocarski E.S. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1435-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), HA-tagged expression vectors for wild type, constitutive active MKK1 (ΔN3-S218E/S222D), and dominant-negative MKK1 (K97M) (20Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). A polyclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody (anti-ACTIVE™ mitogen-activated protein kinase polyclonal antibody) was purchased from Promega; anti-ERK2 antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; monoclonal anti-ERK1/2 antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling; polyclonal antibody to β-galactosidase was obtained from 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc. (Boulder, CO), and anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5) was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Polyclonal antibody to poly(ADP)ribose and all secondary antibodies were obtained from Calbiochem. PD98059 and LY294002 were purchased from Calbiochem. 3-aminobenzamide (ABA), 6(5H)-phenanthridinone (PHEN), BDNF, cycloheximide, dizocilpine (MK-801), dl-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV), NBQX, CNQX, CPDD, and transplatin (TPDD) were obtained from Sigma. BAPTA/AM was purchased from Molecular Probes. Cell Culture and Transfection—Cortical neurons were prepared from newborn rats (Sprague-Dawley) and kept in basal medium Eagle supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine calf serum (HyClone), as described (17Hetman M. Kanning K. Smith-Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22569-22580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). 1-(β-d-Arabinofuranosyl)cytosine (2.5 μm) was added at day 2 in vitro to inhibit proliferation of non-neuronal cells. Cortical neurons were transiently transfected at days 3 or 4 in vitro by using a modified calcium-phosphate co-precipitation protocol (17Hetman M. Kanning K. Smith-Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22569-22580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Cortical neurons cultured on poly-d-lysine/laminin-coated (Sigma) glass coverslips in 35-mm plates were transfected with 4 μg/plate expression plasmid DNA for wild-type MKK1 (MKK1wt), dominant-negative MKK1 (MKK1dn), constitutive-active MKK1 (MKK1ca), or empty cloning vector, pCEP4. In addition, neurons were co-transfected with 2 μg/plate pON260 plasmid DNA, which contains an expression cassette for bacterial β-galactosidase. Expression of recombinant forms of MKK1 was confirmed by immunostaining for HA epitope tag attached to MKK1 proteins. In addition, cell nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 to reveal apoptotic alterations in chromatin structure. β-Galactosidase was used as a marker to identify transfected cells. Because β-galactosidase remains stable in dying cells (21Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R.J. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar), we were able to score for apoptosis in transfected neurons on the single cell level without a bias to exclude apoptotic cells. Drug Treatment—At days 5 or 6 in vitro, cortical neurons were treated with CPDD or TPDD. These drugs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). The final concentration of Me2SO in the media was 0.2%. PD98059, SL327, MK-801, NBQX, CNQX, 3-ABA, PHEN, and BAPTA/AM were also dissolved in Me2SO. When cultures were co-treated with CPDD and one of these drugs, the final concentration of Me2SO was below 0.4%. BDNF was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin before addition to the cells. SL327 or PD98059 was added 30 min before BDNF in co-treatment experiments. Quantitation of Apoptosis by Nuclear Morphological Changes—To visualize nuclear morphology, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 2.5 μg/ml of the DNA dye Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) (17Hetman M. Kanning K. Smith-Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22569-22580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was quantitated by scoring the percentage of cells with apoptotic nuclear morphology at the single cell level after Hoechst staining. Uniformly stained nuclei were scored as healthy, viable neurons. Condensed or fragmented nuclei were scored as apoptotic. To obtain unbiased counting, samples were coded, and cells were scored blind without knowledge of their prior treatment. Quantitation of Neuronal Survival by MTT Assay—The MTT assay was performed in 96-well plates as described (17Hetman M. Kanning K. Smith-Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22569-22580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). DNA Ladder Assay—To examine DNA cleavage, soluble cytoplasmic DNA was isolated from 4 × 106 cells and subjected to 1.8% agarose gel electrophoresis (17Hetman M. Kanning K. Smith-Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22569-22580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Caspase Assay—Caspase assay was performed with a colorimetric caspase assay kit purchased from Promega. For each measurement, protein lysate from 1 × 106 cells was used. To reveal the caspase-dependent activity, each sample was incubated with the caspase substrate in the absence or presence of 10 μm Z-VAD-fmk, a specific caspase inhibitor. Western Analysis and Immunostaining—Western blot analysis with anti-phospho-ERK1/2 or anti-ERK1/2 antibodies was performed as described (17Hetman M. Kanning K. Smith-Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22569-22580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of total protein was used in each lane. In addition, blots were re-probed with antibodies specific for total ERK1/2 or ERK2 to ensure equal protein loading of the blots. Quantification of phospho-ERK1/2 was performed by densitometric analysis and normalized against total ERK1/2. Western blot analysis with anti-poly(ADP-ribose) antibody was performed using 4 μg of nuclear proteins per sample. Nuclear proteins were extracted as described (22Lukasiuk K. Kaczmarek L. Condorelli D.F. Neurochem. Int. 1995; 26: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were detected by immunostaining with an antibody against β-galactosidase and Texas Red-conjugated goat antibody to rabbit immunoglobulin. Cells transfected with the HA epitope-tagged constructs were also immunostained with an antibody to HA followed by fluorescein-conjugated goat antibody to mouse immunoglobulin. Determination of Glutamate and Glycine Concentration—Amino acids were extracted from culture media with 0.6 n perchloric acid, followed by centrifugation and neutralization with potassium hydroxide. The analysis was performed as described (23Hilgier W. Zielinska M. Borkowska H.D. Gadamski R. Walski M. Oja S.S. Saransaari P. Albrecht J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 56: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). NAD+ and ATP Assays—To extract nucleotides, 2 × 106 cells were treated with 3.5% perchloric acid as described (24Komatsu N. Nakagawa M. Oda T. Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). NAD+ level was measured in a reaction catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase as described (25Williamson J.R. Corkey B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1964; 13: 481-483Google Scholar). ATP measurement was performed according to the two-step procedure of Williamson and Corkey (26Williamson J.R. Corkey B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1964; 13: 488-491Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis of the data was performed by using one- or two-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc tests. CPDD-induced Apoptosis in Cortical Neurons—To test the hypothesis that DNA damage can activate the defensive ERK1/2 pathway, we treated cortical neurons with CPDD. CPDD applied for 48 h reduced neuronal survival (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, cells exposed to 10 μg/ml CPDD showed higher survival rates than cells treated with 5 μg/ml (56.4 versus 28%, Fig. 1A). Neurons treated with CPDD showed an apoptotic pattern of DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1B) and activation of proapoptotic caspases (Fig. 1C). In addition, cells dying in response to CPDD displayed morphological features of apoptosis including fragmentation and condensation of nuclear chromatin (Fig. 1, D–J). 10 μg/ml CPDD induced significantly less apoptosis than 5 μg/ml (at 24 h, 28 versus 51.2%, respectively; p < 0.01) (Fig. 1J). A translation inhibitor, cycloheximide, protected against CPDD-induced death (Fig. 1K), suggesting that protein synthesis may be involved in this process. This finding is also consistent with the apoptotic character of CPDD-induced death in cortical neurons. In addition, TPDD, an isomer of CPDD that is unable to induce DNA strand breaks (27Trimmer E.E. Essigmann J.M. Essays Biochem. 1999; 34: 191-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), did not produce neuronal apoptosis (Fig. 1L), indicating that CPDD-induced neuronal apoptosis is triggered by DNA damage. Activation of ERK1/2 Pathway in CPDD-treated Cortical Neurons—Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 residues Thr183 and Tyr185 (position numbers as in human ERK2) by MKK1/2 controls ERK1/2 activation (28Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined the activity of the ERK1/2 pathway by immunoblotting for phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Fig. 2). In cells exposed to 10 μg/ml CPDD, activation peaked at 24 h after treatment (Fig. 2, A and B). At that time point, the extent of CPDD-mediated activation of the ERK1/2 pathway was directly proportional to the concentration of CPDD (Fig. 2 C and D), with the maximum stimulation by 10 μg/ml (5.9-fold above controls). Maximal ERK1/2 activation by 10 μg/ml CPDD correlated with the decreased toxicity of CPDD at 10 μg/ml, as compared with 5 μg/ml (Fig. 1). This finding suggests ERK1/2 involvement in the defensive reaction to damage. Importantly, TPDD (10 μg/ml) did not increase ERK1/2 activity (Fig. 2E). ERK1/2 activation by CPDD was not affected by cycloheximide (1 μg/ml) (Fig. 2F). These data suggest that the ERK1/2 response is triggered by DNA damage and does not involve protein synthesis. CPDD-mediated Activation of ERK1/2 Supports Neuronal Survival—Pharmacological inhibitors of the ERK1/2 pathway, PD98059 or SL327, effectively abolished ERK1/2 activation by CPDD (Fig. 3, A and D). Therefore, we used these compounds to determine the effect of the ERK1/2 response on CPDD-induced cell death. Consistent with our previous observations (17Hetman M. Kanning K. Smith-Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22569-22580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), neither SL327 (50 μm) nor PD98059 (40 μm) significantly affect basal apoptosis in cortical neurons (Fig. 3, B and E). By 24 h, cells exposed to either 5 or 10 μg/ml CPDD showed a significant increase of apoptosis upon co-treatment with SL327 (28.3% at 10 μg/ml CPDD versus 57.8% at SL327 + 10 μg/ml of CPDD; p < 0.001) (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the CPDD concentration dependence of the SL327 effect on apoptosis correlated with the concentration dependence of CPDD-mediated ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 2, C and D). PD98059 also increased apoptosis induced by CPDD (Fig. 3E, p < 0.001). In addition, SL327 (50 μm) or PD98059 (40 μm) further reduced neuronal viability after CPDD treatment (Fig. 3, C and F). To complement the pharmacological approach, we studied the effects of a dominantnegative mutant form of the ERK1/2 activator, MKK1 (MKK1dn) (20Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar), on CPDD-induced apoptosis. Cortical neurons were transfected with expression plasmids for either wild type MKK1 (MKK1wt), MKK1dn, or empty cloning vector, pCEP4 (Fig. 3, G and H). Forty-eight hours after transfection, neurons were treated for 24 h with either vehicle (0.2% Me2SO) or CPDD (10 μg/ml). In vehicle-treated cells, apoptosis was unaffected by any of the transfected plasmids (average of 15.5%, Fig. 3I). In contrast, CPDD caused apoptosis in more cells expressing MKK1dn (46.5 versus 31% in pCEP4 or 26% in MKK1wt-transfected neurons; p < 0.001, Fig. 3I). Therefore, inhibition of ERK1/2 increased apoptotic cell death induced by CPDD. Finally, we studied the effects of PD98059 on CPDD-mediated caspase activation, a marker of apoptotic cell death. 5 but not 10 μg/ml CPDD significantly activated caspases at 12 h (1.9-fold above control, Fig. 3J). When PD98059 was combined with 10 μg/ml CPDD, caspase activation occurred (1.7-fold above control, Fig. 3J). This result confirms that ERK1/2 activation by CPDD suppresses neuronal apoptosis. CPDD Activates ERK1/2 through NMDA Receptors—ERK1/2 can be activated in cortical neurons by the glutamate-triggered influx of Ca2+ ions through an open NMDAR channel (29Bading H. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 253: 912-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Because moderate activity of NMDAR is implicated in anti-apoptotic signaling (5Ikonomidou C. Bosch F. Miksa M. Bittigau P. Vockler J. Dikranian K. Tenkova T.I. Stefovska V. Turski L. Olney J.W. Science. 1999; 283: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar, 30Hetman M. Cavanaugh J.E. Kimelman D. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested for NMDAR involvement in the protective ERK1/2 activation by CPDD. The CPDD-mediated increase of ERK1/2 activity (6.1-fold above controls) was reduced by the NMDAR antagonists kynurenic acid plus Mg2+, MK-801, or APV (1.4-, 0.5-, or 0.6-fold above controls, respectively; Fig. 4A). Also, co-treatment with the cytosolic Ca2+ chelator BAPTA/AM significantly reduced ERK1/2 activation by CPDD (7.1-versus 3.7-fold above controls; Fig. 4A). Furthermore, NMDA receptor antagonists increased apoptosis induced by 24-h treatment with CPDD (30.3% at 10 μg/ml of CPDD versus 51.4% at 10 μg/ml CPDD plus 10 μm MK-801; p < 0.01) (Fig. 4, B and C). Inhibitors of AMPA/KA receptors, CNQX or NBQX, did not affect the ERK1/2 response to CPDD (Fig. 4D). Collectively, the data suggest that the defensive ERK1/2 activation by CPDD is mediated through NMDAR. CPDD Increases NMDAR Signaling—NMDAR can be activated by increased concentration of its ligands, glutamate or NMDA (Fig. 5A). If increased concentrations of NMDAR ligands are responsible for CPDD activation of ERK1/2, one would expect that conditioned media from cells that are exposed to CPDD would produce ERK1/2 activation in untreated neurons. However, ERK1/2 was not activated by conditioned media collected from cells treated for 24 h with 10 μg/ml CPDD (Fig. 5B). Consistently, media concentrations of the NMDAR ligand, glutamate, and its co-ligand, glycine (3Westbrook G.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), did not significantly increase after CPDD treatment (Fig. 5C). Therefore, it seems unlikely that activation of NMDAR by CPDD is caused by an elevated release of the NMDAR ligands. An alternative possibility is that CPDD increases the neuronal responses to basal levels of NMDAR stimulation. Indeed, we found that neurons that were pretreated with 5 μg/ml CPDD for 24 h demonstrated increased ERK1/2 responses to NMDA (Fig. 5, D and E). In cells that were not exposed to CPDD, a 5-min treatment with NMDA evoked a concentration-dependent ERK1/2 activation that appeared at 20 μm (6.1-fold above control) and declined at 50 or 100 μm (3.6- or 2.3-fold above control, respectively; Fig. 5, D and E). Neurons that were pretreated with 5 μg/ml CPDD for 24 h responded with significantly enhanced ERK1/2 activation (p < 0.01) which was present at 10 μm NMDA (5.3-fold above control), reached maximal levels at 50 μm (7.6-fold above control), and slightly declined at 100 μm (4.9-fold above control; Fig. 5, D and E). Therefore, it appears that CPDD decreases the threshold of NMDAR stimulation that is required to activate ERK1/2 and inhibits desensitization of the ERK1/2 response following more intense NMDAR stimulation. These data indicate that CPDD enhances intracellular signaling by NMDAR. PARP Activity Contributes to CPDD-mediated ERK1/2 Activation—ERK1/2 activation apparently was caused by CPDD-induced DNA strand breaks (Fig. 2E) and was dependent upon NMDAR (Figs. 4 and 5). Thus, augmentation of NMDAR signaling in CPDD-treated neurons may be secondary to DNA damage. It has been proposed that a DNA damage-response enzyme, PARP, may regulate NMDAR in neurons (15Ha H.C. Snyder S.H. Neurobiol. Dis. 2000; 7: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have evaluated the possibility that the CPDD-mediated increase in NMDAR signaling is mediated by PARP. Indeed, we observed increased PARP activity after CPDD treatment, indicated by the elevated polyribosylation of neuronal nuclear proteins (Fig. 6A). Also, cellular NAD+ content that is reduced during PARP activation (31D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) significantly decreased after CPDD (Fig. 6B). The NAD+ decrease preceded the CPDD-induced reduction of neuronal survival (Fig. 6C). These data indicate that CPDD activates PARP. To evaluate whether PARP activation can contribute to the protective ERK1/2 activation by CPDD, we studied the effects of the PARP inhibitors, 3-ABA (5 mm) or PHEN (50 μm), on CPDD-induced ERK1/2 activation or cell death. 3-ABA or PHEN reduced ERK1/2 activation in response to CPDD (Fig. 6D) and increased neuronal apoptosis triggered by CPDD (Fig. 6E). Neuronal apoptosis in basal conditions was not affected by either 3-ABA or PHEN (data not shown). Also, the CPDD-mediated reduction in neuronal survival was enhanced in the presence of 3-ABA (Fig. 6F). Therefore, our data suggest that PARP contributes to protective ERK1/2 activation by CPDD. To further support the idea that PARP activation contributes to the increased responsiveness of NMDAR in CPDD-treated neurons, we evaluated the effects of 3-ABA on ERK1/2 activation by NMDA in cells that were pretreated with CPDD (5 μg/ml). Interestingly, neurons pretreated with CPDD in the presence of 3-ABA did not show enhanced ERK1/2 signaling after stimulation with NMDA (Fig. 6G). PARP inhibition abolished ERK1/2 activation at 10 μm NMDA (5.9-versus 0.7-fold above control; Fig. 6G), decreased the activation level at 20 μm (10.2-versus 1.8-fold above control; Fig. 6G), and increased desensitization of ERK1/2 response at 100 μm NMDA (7.4-versus 1.3-fold above control; Fig. 6G). These data suggest that PARP enhances NMDAR-mediated ERK1/2 activation in CPDD-treated neurons. The PARP-mediated increase in NMADR signaling has been suggested to result from ATP depletion after increased NAD+ re-synthesis (31D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). However, we did not find a significant reduction of ATP levels until at least 12 h after CPDD addition (Fig. 6H). A moderate decrease of ATP content occurred at 24 h (79.1% of control values; p < 0.001). This alteration correlates with 82.4% cell survival found at 24 h after 10 μg/ml CPDD treatment (Fig. 6C). Therefore, the reduced ATP content most likely reflects cell loss rather than the energetic deprivation of living neurons. In summary, these data suggest that PARP regulates NMDAR-mediated ERK1/2 activation through an ATP depletion-independent mechanism. BDNF Reduces CPDD Toxicity by Activation of ERK1/2 Pathway—A question can be raised whether neuroprotective agents that activate ERK1/2 would be able to reduce CPDD-mediated cell death. A 6-h treatment with 10 ng/ml BDNF activated ERK1/2 pathway in the absence or presence of CPDD (5 μg/ml) (Fig. 7A). BDNF also decreased CPDD-induced apoptosis from 48.5 to 22.0% (Fig. 7B, p < 0.001). This effect was abolished by 50 μm SL327 indicating that ERK1/2 is required for BDNF-mediated protection of CPDD-treated neurons. To determine whether ERK1/2 activation is sufficient for BDNF-mediated protection, we used a constitutively active mutant form of the ERK1/2 activator, MKK1 (MKK1ca) (20Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). Cortical neurons were transfected with either MKK1ca or empty cloning vector, pCEP4. Forty-eight hours after transfection, neurons were treated for 24 h with 5 μg/ml CPDD. Neurons receiving MKK1ca were protected against CPDD-induced apoptosis (50.3% in pCEP4 versus 19.0% in MKK1ca-transfected cells; p < 0.001) (Fig. 7C). These results suggest that activation of ERK1/2 is both required and sufficient for BDNF to reduce CPDD-induced apoptosis in neurons. In this study, we tested the possibility that ERK1/2 is activated by DNA damage to support survival of stressed neurons. Indeed, we observed that CPDD-induced apoptosis in rat primary cortical neurons was accompanied by anti-apoptotic ERK1/2 activation. We also identified PARP and NMDAR as mediators of CPDD-induced ERK1/2 response (Fig. 8). Finally, we showed that ERK1/2 activation was both necessary and sufficient for BDNF-mediated protection against CPDD-induced apoptosis. In our hands, CPDD induced cortical neuron apoptosis. CPDD was also shown to induce apoptosis in peripheral nervous system neurons of sensory and auditory systems (32Gill J.S. Windebank A.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2842-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 33Liu W. Staecker H. Stupak H. Malgrange B. Lefebvre P. Van De Water T.R. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 2609-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Apoptotic death of these neuronal populations has been suggested as a mechanism of peripheral neurotoxicities of CPDD. Similarly, CPDD-induced cortical neuron apoptosis may underlie the robust central nervous system neurotoxicity observed after local delivery of CPDD to treat intracranial tumors (12Stewart D.J. Rottenberg D.A. Neurological Complications of Cancer Treatment. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston1991: 143-170Google Scholar). CPDD activated ERK1/2 by increasing NMDAR signaling. CPDD increased NMDAR sensitivity to low concentrations of NMDA and also inhibited desensitization of ERK1/2 response after intense receptor stimulation. Furthermore, our results indicate that the mechanism of enhanced NMDAR signaling involves PARP activation. It has been suggested that the PARP-mediated increase of NMADR signaling results from ATP depletion after increased NAD+ resynthesis (15Ha H.C. Snyder S.H. Neurobiol. Dis. 2000; 7: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 31D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). However, we did not find a significant reduction of ATP levels in neurons that showed robust activation of ERK1/2. Consequently, the possible mechanisms of PARP-mediated NMDAR regulation in CPDD-treated cells may include posttranscriptional modifications, differential expression of NMDAR sub-units, depolarization of the membrane through activity of other glutamate receptors, and, finally, enhanced coupling of NMDAR to ERK1/2. In hippocampus, enhancement of the NMDAR response is produced by the primary increase of AMPA/KA receptor activity (3Westbrook G.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This mechanism is unlikely to explain increased NMDAR signaling in CPDD-treated neurons because AMPA/KA receptor blockers did not affect ERK1/2 activation by CPDD. The alternative mechanism producing enhanced NMDAR signaling during development is increased expression of NMDAR subunits (34Sheng M. Cummings J. Roldan L.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 368: 144-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). However, we found no CPDD-induced increases in expression of the two NMDAR subunits, NR1 or NR2B, whose expression is detectable in cultured cortical neurons. 2A. Gozdz and M. Hetman, unpublished data. Therefore, it remains to be resolved which mechanism contributes to CPDD/PARP-mediated regulation of NMDAR. It is well established that excessive stimulation of NMDARs results in excitotoxic neuronal death (6Olney J.W. Neurobiol. Aging. 1994; 15: 259-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the toxic abilities of NMDARs are not directly proportional to their activity. In fact, some NMDAR activity is required for optimal survival of various populations of central nervous system nerve cells, including cortical neurons (5Ikonomidou C. Bosch F. Miksa M. Bittigau P. Vockler J. Dikranian K. Tenkova T.I. Stefovska V. Turski L. Olney J.W. Science. 1999; 283: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar, 30Hetman M. Cavanaugh J.E. Kimelman D. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, moderate concentrations of NMDA can protect cortical neurons from trophic deprivation-induced death (35Terro F. Esclaire F. Yardin C. Hugon J. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 278: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 36Lafon-Cazal M. Perez V. Bockaert J. Marin P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, NMDAR signaling plays an important role to support neuronal survival during development. Our results identify a new role for the anti-apoptotic activity of NMDAR in protecting neurons exposed to genotoxic stress. Our data suggest that the activation of PARP in neurons is protective against CPDD-induced cell death. Protective properties of PARP were also reported in various other cell types including cancer cells, embryonic mouse tissue, and rat hippocampal neurons (37Bowman K.J. Newell D.R. Calvert A.H. Curtin N.J. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 84: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 38Nagayama T. Simon R.P. Chen D. Henshall D.C. Pei W. Stetler R.A. Chen J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1636-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 39de Murcia J.M. Niedergang C. Trucco C. Ricoul M. Dutrillaux B. Mark M. Oliver F.J. Masson M. Dierich A. LeMeur M. Walztinger C. Chambon P. de Murcia G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7303-7307Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). For instance, in a rat global ischemia model, CA1 neuron loss was enhanced by the PARP inhibitor 3-ABA (38Nagayama T. Simon R.P. Chen D. Henshall D.C. Pei W. Stetler R.A. Chen J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1636-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). On the other hand, other reports showed that intense PARP activation depletes cellular energy stores and induces necrosis (15Ha H.C. Snyder S.H. Neurobiol. Dis. 2000; 7: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The discrepancies between observations suggesting that PARP mediated protection and those indicating that deleterious PARP effects can be attributed to the differences in the intensity of PARP activation. For example, PARP activation after CPDD resulted in a 20% reduction of NAD+ levels at 12 h after treatment and undetectable changes in ATP levels. Similarly, protective PARP activation by global ischemia did not significantly reduce NAD+ levels (38Nagayama T. Simon R.P. Chen D. Henshall D.C. Pei W. Stetler R.A. Chen J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1636-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In contrast, deleterious PARP activation after treatment with an alkylating drug, N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, decreased NAD+ levels by at least 80% within 60 min (40Yu S.W. Wang H. Poitras M.F. Coombs C. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Poirier G.G. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2002; 297: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). Therefore, PARP activation by CPDD may be insufficient to produce pro-necrotic energy depletion. In conclusion, data presented here suggest that, as in the case of NMDAR signaling, moderate PARP activation also promotes neuronal survival. Defensive activation of ERK1/2 by CPDD is not a unique stress-activated compensatory response in neurons. In fact, it has been revealed that NF-κB activated by various forms of stress protects neurons from death (41Mattson M.P. Goodman Y. Luo H. Fu W. Furukawa K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 681-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Gonzalez-Zulueta et al. (42Gonzalez-Zulueta M. Feldman A.B. Klesse L.J. Kalb R.G. Dillman J.F. Parada L.F. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) reported that transient ischemic stimulation activated ERK1/2 by NMDAR. Inhibition of this signaling increased sensitivity to a subsequent ischemic insult. Therefore, ERK1/2 activation by NMDAR may be used by neurons to resist various forms of injury. In summary, CPDD-induced genotoxic stress activated an anti-apoptotic ERK1/2 response. This effect was mediated by PARP, which enhanced NMDAR signaling in CPDD-treated neurons. Therefore, our results identify a novel compensatory circuit to defend central nervous system neurons against genotoxic apoptosis. This defensive pathway couples DNA damage through PARP and NMDAR to ERK1/2 activation. Moreover, our data suggest that PARP regulates NMDAR signaling using a novel, ATP decline-independent mechanism. Our data also indicate the possibility of potentially toxic interactions between clinically used NMDAR antagonists, including ketamine or memantine, and genotoxic therapies that target tumors.

The biophysical properties of membranes are critically dependent on the degree of desaturation of their hydrocarbon core (1Kates M. Pugh E.L. Ferrante G. Kates M. Manson L.A. Membrane Fluidity. Plenum Press, New York1984: 379-395Crossref Google Scholar). When environmental (dietary) sources are scarce, the pool of unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA precursors required for the assembly of membranes and other lipid-based structures is maintained by synthesis of oleoyl-CoA (18:1) and palmitolyl-CoA (16:1) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SCD, stearoyl-CoA desaturase; SCD Pr, stearoyl-CoA desaturase protease; Pg, plasminogen; HSWM, high salt-washed microsomes; 2-D DIGE, two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; PSD, Post-Source-Decay data; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; uPA, urokinase; tPA, tissue plasminogen activator; TX-100, Triton X-100; PrPc, cellular prion protein of sheep.1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SCD, stearoyl-CoA desaturase; SCD Pr, stearoyl-CoA desaturase protease; Pg, plasminogen; HSWM, high salt-washed microsomes; 2-D DIGE, two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; PSD, Post-Source-Decay data; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; uPA, urokinase; tPA, tissue plasminogen activator; TX-100, Triton X-100; PrPc, cellular prion protein of sheep. by Δ9 stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). The rate of unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA synthesis is directly related to the concentration of SCD in the ER (2Enoch H.G. Catala A. Strittmatter P. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5095-5103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); no allosteric mechanisms of SCD regulation have been identified. The concentration of SCD in the ER membrane is determined by the rates of SCD synthesis and degradation. Transcriptional regulation of SCD synthesis has been studied extensively (3Ntambi J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1549-1558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Heinemann F.S. Ozols J. Prostaglandins, Leukotrines, and Essential Fatty Acids (2003). 2003; 68: 123-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). SCD degradation is less well understood but is critical to the regulation of SCD, because the concentration of an enzyme can be reduced rapidly only if it is short-lived. Hepatic SCD is degraded more rapidly than most ER proteins and has a half-life of about 3–4 h (5Oshino N. Sato R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 149: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The physiological need to rapidly degrade SCD is not clear, but this property of SCD has been maintained during evolution, because yeast SCD is also rapidly degraded (6Braun S. Matuschewski M. Rape M. Thomas T. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Presumably, excessive availability of unsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs would result in the assembly of membranes that are too disordered and be detrimental.We have studied the degradation of SCD in two systems. Investigation of SCD-green fluorescent protein chimeras expressed in cultured animal cells identified a 33-amino acid segment at the amino terminus of SCD that is essential for optimal degradation of those constructs (7Mziaut H.

We have also investigated the degradation of SCD in liver using conventional methods of subcellular fractionation, protein isolation, and reconstitution (9Ozols J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2281-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10Heinemann F.S. Ozols J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3445-3453Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). When liver microsomes prepared from rats induced to express high levels of hepatic SCD are incubated at 37 °C, rapid and selective degradation of SCD occurs (9Ozols J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2281-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The microsomal protease that degrades SCD (SCD Pr) is tightly membrane-bound, because it cannot be extracted by selective release of luminal ER proteins or by high salt washing procedures that remove proteins from the cytosolic surface of microsomes (10Heinemann F.S. Ozols J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3445-3453Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). [35S]SCD synthesized in vitro is also rapidly degraded by desaturase-induced liver microsomes, whereas, under the same conditions, several other microsomal proteins synthesized in vitro are stable (11Heinemann F.S. Mziaut H. Korza G. Ozols J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6929-6937Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Using specific degradation of [35S]SCD as an assay to monitor the purification of SCD Pr, a 90-kDa protease was isolated from the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of high salt washed microsomes (11Heinemann F.S. Mziaut H. Korza G. Ozols J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6929-6937Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Upon incubation, the 90-kDa form of the protease undergoes rapid conversion to a series of smaller proteins. This conversion is associated with a marked increase in proteolytic activity. The purified protease is partially inhibited by diisopropylphosphofluoridate, dithiothreitol, and leupeptin suggesting it is a serine protease zymogen with Arg/Lys specificity and an essential disulfide bond (11Heinemann F.S. Mziaut H. Korza G. Ozols J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6929-6937Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry of its tryptic peptides indicated that the 90-kDa protein is a microsomal form of Pg. This prompted us to compare SCD Pr with Pg isolated from plasma, to study the activation of Pg in microsomes, and to examine SCD expression and degradation in mice with a genetic deficiency in Pg. In light of recent evidence that Pg is expressed in a broad range of tissues (12Zhang L. Seiffert D. Fowler B.J. Jenkins G.R. Thinnes T.C. Loskutoff D.J. Parmer R.J. Miles L.A. Thromb. Haemost. 2002; 87: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the significance of plasmin as an intracellular protease is discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Chemicals and reagents, including bdellin, were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. CHAPS was from ProChem, Inc., l-[35S]methionine was from Amersham Biosciences, and restriction and modification enzymes were from Invitrogen. The vector pGEM-11Zf(+) used for the coupled transcription/translation reactions and the coupled transcription/translation system (TnT®) were from Promega. Rat Pg was from Innovative Research, Inc. Polyclonal goat antibody against rat Pg was obtained from Accurate Chemical Scientific Corp. N-Glycosidase F was from Calbiochem. Pg-deficient (Pg–/–) mice and wild-type littermate controls were female and ∼3 weeks old and were obtained from Jackson Laboratories.Construction of Plasmids—The construction of the plasmid and the cDNA encoding the rat liver stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) were described previously (7Mziaut H. Korza G. Ozols J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8883-8888Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNAs encoding the full-length of rat liver SCD preceded by Kozak sequence and EcoRI site at 5′-end and extended at 3′-end by NotI site was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The resulting PCR product was digested with EcoRI-NotI and inserted into EcoRI-NotI digested pGEM-11Zf(+).Analysis of Protein Degradation—SCD degradation was assayed by following the disappearance of native SCD in either mouse microsomes or desaturase-induced rat microsomes by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis or the disappearance of [35S]SCD by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE. [35S]SCD was prepared by coupled transcription/translation as previously described (11Heinemann F.S. Mziaut H. Korza G. Ozols J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6929-6937Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A working solution of [35S]SCD degradation substrate was prepared by diluting 10 μl of the transcription/translation reaction product containing labeled proteins with 90 μlof20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0. Assays were initiated by adding an aliquot (1–5 μl) of the indicated fraction to 10 μl of the diluted TnT® reaction product. Assays were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. Control mixtures were maintained at –20 °C. Degradation was terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 2 min.Immunoblot Analysis—Preparation of polyclonal antisera against SCD was described previously (10Heinemann F.S. Ozols J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3445-3453Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on 6% or 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated with 3% albumin. The transblots were incubated with antibody against SCD or rat Pg overnight at 4 °C. Bound antibody was detected with an anti-IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and a phosphatase detection kit (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratory, Gaithersburg, MD).Preparation of Microsomes and Purification of the SCD Protease— Desaturase-induced rat liver microsomes were prepared as described previously (10Heinemann F.S. Ozols J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3445-3453Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Subsequent purification of the SCD protease was done at 4 °C as described previously (11Heinemann F.S. Mziaut H. Korza G. Ozols J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6929-6937Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Coomassie Blue colorimetric method (Pierce).MALDI Mass Spectrometry—For identification of the 90-kDa protein, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and protein bands were excised with a razor blade. Gel pieces were rinsed in water, and in-gel tryptic digest was performed. Peptide digests were concentrated using ZipTip C18 micropipette tips (Millipore Corp.). MALDI-TOF and Post-Source-Decay (PSD) data were obtained on an AXIMA-CFR mass spectrometer using software version 2.0.1 (Kratos Analytical, Manchester, UK). Mass spectra were obtained at a laser power near threshold with pulsed extraction optimized for 2000 Da. PSD data were obtained at a laser power about 15% higher than threshold. Samples were cocrystallized with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/ml in 1% formic acid, 50% acetonitrile). PSD fragment ions were fitted to a generated curve that was calibrated with PSD fragments from the synthetic peptide, P14R. Data base searches were performed using Protein Prospector version 3.4.1. PSD fragments were searched against the NCBI nonredundant data base using MS-Tag and 0.2 Da as the parent tolerance and 0.5 Da as the fragment ion tolerance (13Nebl T. Pestonjamasp K.N. Leszyk J.D.

Chem. 2002; 277: 43399-43409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar).Inhibition of SCD Pr by Bdellin—Inhibition of SCD proteolysis was determined by the addition of bdellin to aliquots of either the translation mixture containing [35S]Met-labeled SCD and SCD Pr or to desaturase induced rat microsomes. The samples were incubated on ice for 30 min followed by incubation at 37 °C for the indicated times.Zymography—Standard zymography was performed using 0.2% casein copolymerized in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (14Leber T.M. Balkwill F.R. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 249: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The presence of Pg activators was determined by Pg zymography using casein (0.2%) and Pg (10 μg/ml) copolymerized in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (15Heussen C. Dowdle E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar, 16Roche P.C. Campeau J.D. Shaw Jr., S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 745: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was done at 4 °C under nonreducing conditions. The gels were washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1 h and then incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 37 °C either overnight for standard zymography or 1 h for Pg zymography. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue.Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase Activity—The microsomal membrane homogenates were prepared as described above. Reactions were performed at 37 °C for 1 h with aliquots of microsomal protein suspension at 8 μg/μl and 1.5 nmol of [1-14C]stearoyl-CoA (62 μCi/μmol), 100 μm NADH, 50 μm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, in a volume of 50 μl. After the reaction, 150 μl of water was added and saponification was carried out in vacuum-sealed glass vacuoles containing 200 μl of KOH/ethanol (0.1g/1 ml) at 100 °C for 20 min. The mixture was then acidified with 200 μl of 6 n HCl, fatty acids were extracted with heptane, evaporated to dryness, and then methylated with methanol/HCl at 25 °C for 18 h. After evaporation and resuspension in 30 μl of chloroform, saturated fatty acid and monounsaturated fatty acid methyl esters were separated by 5% AgNO3-impregnated TLC using benzene as developing solution. The TLC plates were then subjected to autoradiography. The enzyme activity was determined as nanomoles·min–1·mg–1 protein.HPLC Analysis of SCD Degradation—To identify SCD cleavage sites, 20 μg of purified microsomal SCD was incubated with a 2-μl aliquot of either SCD Pr fraction or plasmin (1 μg) at 37 °C for 12 h. Rat plasmin was generated from rat Pg by urokinase (1:20 ratio) at 37 °C for 3 h. Peptides were extracted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 25% acetonitrile in water and subjected to HPLC using (A) 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and (B) 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 75% acetonitrile as solvents with a linear gradient of 0–70% B in 50 min. Isolated peptides were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 470A sequencer.Two-dimensional Difference Gel Electrophoresis—Rat Pg and SCD Pr were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 dye, respectively, followed by isoelectric focusing (24 cm, pH 3–10 immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strip) as per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). For the second-dimensional separation, the IPG strips were then loaded and run on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel. Both samples were run on the same gel, and fluorescent images were analyzed.Deglycosylation—Protein samples (2 μg) were diluted in 0.1% SDS, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Triton-X100, and 50 mm NaHPO4, pH 7.4, in 50 μl and boiled for 5 min at 100 °C. Then 2 μl of N-glycosidase F (10 units) or H2O were added to each tube and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies against Pg. Human Pg was used as a positive control.Kinetic Assays—The kinetic parameters of SCD Pr and rat plasmin were measured with the substrate d-Ile-Phe-Lys p-nitroanilide (Sigma I6886) in an assay buffer (0.05 m Tris·HCl/0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.4). The reaction was initiated by addition of enzyme (1 μg in a 2-μl aliquot) to the assay buffer containing substrate (final concentration 10–1000 μm) in a total volume of 200 μl in microtiter plates at 37 °C. The generation of amidolytic activity (at 405 nm) was monitored at 37 °C for 3 min in a microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The Km values were calculated using Prism software (GraphPad Co.).RESULTSWe previously reported the purification of a 90-kDa protein that selectively degrades microsomal SCD. To identify the 90-kDa protein, tryptic peptides obtained by in-gel digestion of SDS-PAGE gel slices were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. 1A). Eleven peptides matching the molecular weight predicted for tryptic peptides of Pg were identified (Table I). The matched peptides represented the most prominent ions present. No other proteins were matched by data base searches using the predominant ions. The identified peptides span the entire Pg sequence except for the amino-terminal 68 residues of the intact secreted form. These results demonstrate that the predominant protein in the 90-kDa gel band is closely related and possibly identical to the circulating form of Pg. A similar tryptic peptide profile was obtained when rat Pg was analyzed by the same method, although the yield of some peptides was differed (Fig. 1B).Table IMALDI-MS/PSD analysis of fragmented SCD Pr and serum plasminogen yields similar peptidesPeptideNo.Sequencem/z (Meas.)MH+ (Calc.)88-97(1)MRDVILFEKR(V)1306.7701306.730137-153(2)YSPSTHPSEGLEENYCR(N)2039.8302039.877299-306(3)WSEQTPHR(H)1040.4801040.491318-325(4)NLEENYCR(N)1111.6501111.484493-514(5)TAVTAAGTPCQEWAAQEPHSHR(I)2418.9902419.121515-523(6)IFTPQTNPR(A)1073.5601073.574659-672(7)LVLEPNDADIALLK(L)1523.8901523.889801-807(8)YVNWIER(E)979.510979.500801-810(9)YVNWIEREMR(N)1395.7401395.684411-426(10)TPANFPDAGLEMNYCR1869.8401869.826582-600(11)VVGGCVANPHSWPWQISLR2177.0802177.108 Open table in a new tab The presence of Pg in the SCD Pr preparation was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. The mobility of SCD Pr was identical to Pg isolated from rat plasma (Fig. 2A). A protein band with mobility identical to Pg was detected in microsomal fractions obtained during purification of SCD Pr by immunoblot analysis with Pg antibody, and the amount of the Pg immunoreactive band increased with progressive purification of SCD protease activity (Fig. 2B). The mobility of both Pg and SCD Pr relative to an 111-kDa protein standard was dependent on the acrylamide concentration of the gels. In 6% SDS-PAGE gels, both Pg and SCD Pr migrated slightly slower than the 111-kDa protein standard (Fig. 2), whereas in 10% SDS-PAGE gels they migrated faster than the 111-kDa protein standard (Fig. 3B). The reason for this difference relative to the standard is not clear, but under both sets of SDS-PAGE conditions, the mobility of SCD Pr was identical to the mobility of Pg. The SDS-PAGE protein profiles of SCD Pr under reducing and nonreducing conditions were compared with Pg (Fig. 3, A and B). Pg had a significantly higher mobility in nonreduced SDS-PAGE gels as compared with reduced gels presumably, because its numerous internal disulfide bonds maintain it in a compact conformation even after denaturation in SDS. SCD Pr exhibited the same SDS-PAGE mobility shift under nonreducing conditions. The SCD Pr preparation used in the experiments shown in Fig. 3 (A and B) had been stored briefly at 4 °C. We previously showed that the 90-kDa form of SCD Pr is converted to a spectrum of smaller peptides when stored at 4 °C (11Heinemann F.S. Mziaut H. Korza G. Ozols J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6929-6937Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A number of minor peptide bands were detected by reduced SDS-PAGE of the stored SCD Pr preparation that were not evident in nonreduced gels. This suggests that upon storage at 4 °C certain peptide bonds in SCD Pr are cleaved, and the resulting peptides are held together by disulfide bonds.Fig. 2Pg immunoblot and SDS-PAGE analysis of SCD protease (SCD Pr).

Only human Pg showed evidence of N-glycosylation. E, 2-D DIGE analysis of rat Pg and SCD Pr display identical mobility.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To evaluate their N-linked carbohydrate status, Pg and SCD Pr were digested with endoglycosidase F followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (Fig. 3, C and D). Endoglycosidase F digestion of rat Pg and SCD Pr did not alter their mobility upon SDS-PAGE. Human Pg was used as a positive control in these experiments, because it exists in two major glycoforms (17Pirie-Shepherd, S. R., Stevens, R. D., Andon, N. L., Enghild, J. J., and Pizzo, S. V. (l997) J. Biol. Chem., 272, 7408–7411Google Scholar). Human Pg I contains an N-linked oligosaccharide at Asn289 and an O-linked oligosaccharide at Thr345. Human Pg II contains only an O-linked oligosaccharide at Thr345. As expected, SDS-PAGE of human Pg revealed a doublet, and treatment of human Pg with N-glycosidase F resulted in depletion of the upper band (form I). Thus, it appears that, in contrast of human Pg, rat Pg and SCD Pr lack N-linked carbohydrate structures. The O-linked carbohydrate status of rat serum Pg is not known. SCD Pr was further compared with Pg by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and no significant difference in mobility was observed (Fig. 3E). The amidase parameters of SCD Pr and rat plasmin toward substrate d-Ile-Phe-Lys p-nitroanilide were similar, with Km values of 18.2 and 18.3 μm, respectively.Because SCD Pr appeared to represent a microsomal form of Pg, the ability of Pg and plasmin isolated from rat plasma to degrade SCD was investigated (Fig. 4A). There was no detectable degradation of SCD when it was incubated with 0.6 μm Pg for 2 h at 37 °C. By contrast, coincubation of SCD with 0.6 μm Pg and urokinase (uPA) or tissue Pg activator (tPA) led to extensive degradation of SCD within 2 h (Fig. 4A, lanes 4 and 5). These results indicate that plasmin is able to degrade SCD. The results obtained with Pg alone suggest the Pg preparation was not contaminated with plasmin or Pg activators. The peptides produced by plasmic cleavage of SCD were compared with degradation products produced by incubating SCD with SCD Pr (Fig. 4, B and C). As shown, the HPLC profiles of the peptides produced by SCD Pr and plasmin were nearly identical. Sequence analysis of the identified peptides showed cleavage at Lys residues and a single peptide resulting from cleavage at His residue (Fig. 4D). No cleavage at Arg residues was identified, despite the presence of 22 Arg residues and 20 Lys residues in the SCD sequence (9Ozols J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2281-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Fig. 4Rat plasmin degrades SCD and cleaves at the same sites as SCD Pr.

https://openalex.org/W2104861360,"Mammals possess membrane-associated and cytosolic forms of the puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PSA; EC 3.4.11.14). Increasing evidence suggests the membrane PSA is involved in neuromodulation within the central nervous system and in reproductive biology. The functional roles of the cytosolic PSA are less clear. The genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans encodes an aminopeptidase, F49E8.3 (PAM-1), that is orthologous to PSA, and sequence analysis predicts it to be cytosolic. We have determined the spatio/temporal gene expression pattern of pam-1 by using the promoter region of F49E8.3 to control expression in the nematode of a second exon translational fusion of the aminopeptidase to green fluorescent protein. Cytosolic fluorescence was observed throughout development in the intestine and nerve cells of the head. Neuronal expression was also observed in the tail of adult males. Recombinant PAM-1, expressed and purified from Escherichia coli, hydrolyzed the N-terminal amino acid from peptide substrates. Favored substrates had positively charged or small neutral amino acids in the N-terminal position. Peptide hydrolysis was inhibited by the metal-chelating agent 1,10-phenanthroline and by the aminopeptidase inhibitors actinonin, amastatin, and leuhistin. However, the enzyme was ∼100-fold less sensitive toward puromycin (IC50, 135 μm) than other PSA homologues. Following inactivation of the enzyme, aminopeptidase activity was recovered with Zn2+, Co2+, and Ni2+. Silencing expression of pam-1 by RNA interference resulted in 30% embryonic lethality. Surviving adult hermaphrodites deposited large numbers of oocytes throughout the self-fertile period. The overall brood size was, however, unaffected. We conclude that pam-1 encodes an aminopeptidase that clusters phylogenetically with the PSAs, despite attenuated sensitivity toward puromycin, and that it functions in embryo development and reproduction of the nematode.

Metalloaminopeptidases catalyze the removal of amino acids from the N terminus of oligopeptides. Aminopeptidases are found in a wide variety of cells; they can be membrane-associated or cytosolic, and they have been implicated in a wide variety of physiological processes, including protein processing, regulation of peptide hormone action, viral infection, and cancer cell proliferation (1Taylor A.

Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 960-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 6Osada T. Watanabe G. Sakaki Y. Takeuchi T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 882-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The cytosolic isoform of rat PSA is also predominantly found in the brain, although there is also distribution among other organs (3McLellan S. Dyer S.H. Rodriguez G. Hersh L.B. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 1552-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Neuropeptides, such as enkephalins, have been proposed as substrates for both isoforms of PSA, although the intracellular localization of the cytosolic PSA makes such activity questionable for this isoform. Interestingly, the cytosolic rat brain PSA has been shown to be developmentally regulated, leading to the proposal that the intracellular enzyme could be required for phasic processes related to the development of the central nervous system (7de Gandarias J.M. Irazusta J. Gil J. Fernandez D. Varona A. Casis L. Brain Res. Bull. 1999; 50: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The recent isolation of a Drosophila melanogaster cytosolic PSA mutant exhibiting defects in spermatogenesis indicates likely structure-function conservation of both isoforms of this aminopeptidase across evolutionary well diverged species (8Schulz C. Perezgasga L. Fuller M.T. Dev. Genes Evol. 2001; 211: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). An aminopeptidase with increased sensitivity toward puromycin, relative to PSA, and with biochemical properties distinct from the ubiquitous PSA, has been shown to localize exclusively to neurons of the central nervous system of rats (9Hui K.S. Saito M. Hui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31053-31060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The predominant intracellular localization of this enzyme and its developmental expression profile suggest a role in neuronal growth and differentiation (10Hui M. Hui K.S. Neurochem. Res. 2003; 28: 855-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The in vivo substrates and precise physiological roles of these different aminopeptidases and their isoforms in the central nervous system remain to be elucidated. Recently, human cytosolic PSA has been shown to hydrolyze cytotoxic T cell epitope precursors and hence contribute to the processing of major histocompatibility complex class I peptides (11Stoltze L. Schirle M. Schwarz G. Schroter C. Thompson M.W. Hersh L.B. Kalbacher H. Stevanovic S. Rammensee H.G. Schild H. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 12Saric T.

The cytosolic isoform has also been implicated in cell cycle regulation, because puromycin causes cell cycle arrest of murine COS cells (13Constam D.B. Tobler A.R. Rensing-Ehl A. Kemler I. Hersh L.B. Fontana A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26931-26939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Addition of a non-competitive inhibitor of PSA to a human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line also caused reduced tumor cell invasion (14Kagechika H. Komoda M. Fujimoto Y. Koiso Y. Takayama H.

The identification within murine PSA of two motifs, conserved among 26 S proteasome subunits and microtubule-binding sites, coupled with the subcellular localization of PSA to mitotic spindles in mammalian cell lines, may offer some insight into the mode(s) of action of the enzyme (13Constam D.B.

The sequencing of the entire genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (17The C. elegans Sequencing ConsortiumScience. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3548) Google Scholar), and the powerful molecular and genetic techniques applicable to this organism, make it an excellent model system for the study of biological processes. The C. elegans genome potentially encodes ∼320 peptidases, which have been classified into five families on the basis of their catalytic mechanisms (18Rawlings N.D. O'Brien E. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The metallopeptidase family contains most members, several of which have been defined by classic genetic approaches to reveal diverse roles in development, growth, and behavior (19Hishida R. Ishihara T. Kondo K. Katsura I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4111-4122Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20Wen C. Metzstein M.M. Greenwald I.

Genome-wide reverse genetics offers an alternative strategy for identifying physiological roles for C. elegans genes, although to date only a small number of metallopeptidases have been defined using such approaches (25Maeda I. Kohara Y. Yamamoto M. Sugimoto A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 171-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 26Kamath R.S. Fraser A.G. Dong Y. Poulin G. Durbin R. Gotta M.

Analysis of the C. elegans genome predicts a single aminopeptidase gene (F49E8.3) with high homology to the cytosolic human PSA. In the present study we show that the C. elegans PSA orthologue, termed PAM-1 (puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase), is expressed throughout development in intestinal and nerve cells and exhibits an RNAi phenotype consistent with roles in embryo development and reproduction. Nematode Culture and Transformation—The C. elegans Bristol strain (N2) was grown at 20 °C on NGM agar (1.7% (w/v) agar, 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 μg ml–1 peptone, 5 μg ml–1 cholesterol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2) supplemented with Escherichia coli OP50. Young adult hermaphrodites were transformed by microinjection of the syncytial gonad with plasmid pLS47 (see below) and pRF4, which encodes the dominant selectable marker rol-6 (su1006) (27Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2392) Google Scholar). Transmitting lines were established on the basis of the right-hand roller phenotype. Constructs Used to Generate the Expression Pattern—The pam-1 promoter was PCR-amplified with Expand HF Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science, Lewes, East Sussex, UK) and primers OL28 (5′-CTGCAGCATTTACCCGAGTTGCCTTCT-3′; cosmid F49E8 nucleotides 8821–8801) and OL29 (5′-GGATCCTGCATAGCGAGCATAAGTCGA3′; cosmid F49E8 nucleotides 3717–3737), using cosmid F49E8 (Sanger Centre, Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, UK) as the template (94 °C for 5 min followed by 20 cycles of 94 °C for 30s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 4 min). The resultant 5.1-kb PCR product was cloned into pCR-XL-TOPO (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) to generate pLS20. For expression pattern analysis, the PCR product was excised from pLS20 using PstI and BamHI restriction sites and subcloned into pPD95.69 (A. Fire vector kit 1995) to generate pLS47. Microscopy—Transgenic C. elegans transmitting the pLS47 construct were examined using a Leica HC inverted microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzair, Germany) at an excitation wavelength of 475 nm. Images were captured using a charge-coupled device camera and OPENLAB 3.0.4 image capture software (Improvision Inc., Lexington, MA). RNA Interference—A 426-bp fragment comprising exons 1 and 2 of pam-1 was excised from pLS22 (see below), using SalI-PstI, and subcloned into the corresponding sites of the plasmid L4440 (pPD129.36) (A. Fire vector kit 1999) to generate pLS31. E. coli HT115(DE3) harboring pLS31 was used as the food source for the C. elegans RNAi-sensitive mutant rrf-3 (28Simmer F. Tijsterman M. Parrish S. Koushika S.P. Nonet M.L. Fire A. Ahringer J. Plasterk R.H. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1317-1319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) to silence pam-1 gene expression as described previously (29Kamath, R. S., Martinez-Campos, M., Zipperlen, P., Fraser, A. G., and Ahringer, J. (2000) Genome Biology http://genomebiology.com/2000/2/1/RESEARCH/0002Google Scholar, 30Timmons L. Court D.L. Fire A. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 263: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). Briefly, expression of dsRNA was induced at 37 °C in a mid-log phase culture of E. coli HT115(DE3) harboring pLS31, by addition of 0.4 mm IPTG. After a period of 4 h of growth at 37 °C, a further 0.4 mm IPTG was added to the culture, and bacteria were aliquoted onto NGM agar plates supplemented with 1 mm IPTG. L4 stage larvae were allowed to feed on the bacteria for 3 days at 20 °C, and then individual L4 animals (F1 generation) were transferred onto plates, prepared as above. Nematodes were transferred onto fresh plates at 24-h intervals, for a period of 3 days, and scored for numbers of oocytes, eggs, and progeny. Controls, using HT115(DE3) as the food source, were carried out in parallel using an identical protocol. Constructs Used to Generate the Recombinant PAM-1—The complete cDNA encoding PAM-1 was PCR-amplified with Platinum Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and primers OL32 (5′-CTGCAGGCGGCCTGTGGAAACCCAAGC-3′) and OL33 (5′-GGTACCTTAAACGTTGCTCTGTTTAAGA-3′), using λZAP II yk348g1 as the template (94 °C for 2 min followed by 20 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 2.5 min). The 2.7-kb PCR product was cloned into pCR-XL-TOPO (Invitrogen) to generate pLS22. The construct was sequenced to confirm integrity and then excised and subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pBAD/His C (Invitrogen), using PstI and KpnI restriction sites, to generate pLS28. Trial expression and purification, as detailed below, revealed that recombinant PAM-1 interacted weakly with the Ni-NTA resin. To improve binding of the recombinant protein to the Ni-NTA resin the N-terminal hexahistidine tag was engineered by mutagenesis to contain 10 histidine residues. Briefly, two independent single-cycle (94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 13 min and 20 s) primer extension reactions were performed, using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and oligonucleotides OL44 (5′-GGGGTTCTCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATGG-3′) and OL45 (5′CCATGATGATGATGATGATGATGATGATGATGAGAACCC-3′) (nucleotides in boldface encode the additional 4 histidine residues), with pLS28 as the template. Equal volumes of each primer extension reaction were mixed, and mutagenesis was carried out by thermocycling (18 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 13 min and 20 s) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as described by the manufacturer. Subsequent DNA sequence analysis confirmed the integrity of the mutated plasmid, designated pLS35. Expression and Purification of Recombinant PAM-1—E. coli TOP10 harboring pLS35 was grown at 37 °C to mid-log phase, and expression of PAM-1 was induced by addition of 0.2% (w/v) arabinose. Four hours post-induction, cells were harvested and recombinant PAM-1 was purified from the soluble fraction by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Crawley, West Sussex, UK). The recombinant enzyme was eluted from the Ni-NTA column with 50 mm imidazole, and 4 × 1-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The eluate containing purified PAM-1 was passed through a 30K microsep concentrator (Flowgen, Lichfield, Staffordshire, UK) to allow buffer exchange with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. The recombinant enzyme was stored at –20 °C in 50% (v/v) glycerol. Protein quantification was carried out using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and bovine serum albumin as the standard. Immunoelectrophoretic Blot Analysis—Samples were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocked using TBS/0.1% (v/v) Tween 20/5% (w/v) milk powder. Detection utilized goat antimouse His tag primary antibody (1:3000 in TBS/0.1% (v/v) Tween 20/0.5% (w/v) milk powder) (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, Dorset, UK) and anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1 in 10,000 in TBS/0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus) as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). Biochemical Assays—Amino acid methyl coumarin (AMC) substrates were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Assays were performed at ambient temperature in a Wallac Victor2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, UK) microplate reader adapted with emission and excitation filters of 380 and 460 nm, respectively. Each assay was performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and comprised 10 ng of recombinant PAM-1 and a range of substrate concentrations between 1 μm and 0.8 mm in the presence of 1 mg ml–1 bovine serum albumin and 1 mm glutathione. Inhibitors were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and preincubated for 15 min at varying concentrations with enzyme in the assay buffer. Inhibitor assays were initiated by addition of 10 μm Arg-AMC. Enzyme kinetics was determined using WorkOut (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and EnzPack (Biosoft) software. The IC50 values were calculated from semi-log plots with a minimum of nine different concentrations of inhibitor. Sequence Analysis of the C. elegans Gene Encoding PAM-1—A full-length expressed sequence tag (yk348g1), derived from a him-8 (high incidence of males) mixed-stage cDNA library, was completely sequenced by primer walking, confirming the 884-amino acid PAM-1 sequence prediction (CE10790) in the C. elegans data base (www.wormbase.org). Examination using SignalP (version 1.1, www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP) of the genomic sequence upstream of the designated start methionine codon did not reveal the presence of a potential signal peptide sequence, and hence PAM-1 is predicted to be an intracellular aminopeptidase. The amino acid sequence contained the active site residues HEXXH(X)18E and GAMEN, as expected for a member of the M1 family of aminopeptidases (Fig. 1A). Residues 227–251 of PAM-1 show 46% identity, 71% similarity, to the putative α-type proteasome subunit motif identified in the murine PSA (13Constam D.B. Tobler A.R. Rensing-Ehl A. Kemler I. Hersh L.B. Fontana A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26931-26939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The microtubule-binding site motif identified in mouse PSA (13Constam D.B. Tobler A.R. Rensing-Ehl A. Kemler I. Hersh L.B. Fontana A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26931-26939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) is poorly conserved in PAM-1 (data not shown). Overall, PAM-1 is 36% identical to human membrane PSA, 37% identical to human cytosolic PSA, and 38% identical to the Drosophila melanogaster PSA. Cluster analysis confirmed PAM-1 to be the C. elegans PSA orthologue (Fig. 1B). Expression Pattern Analysis of PAM-1—The spatio/temporal expression pattern of PAM-1 was studied by generation of transgenic C. elegans expressing extrachromosomal arrays of the pPD95.69 plasmid engineered to comprise 4.6 kb of sequence immediately 5′ of pam-1 and an additional 0.5 kb of pam-1 sequence, generating a second exon translational fusion to GFP (pLS47). Independent lines of transgenic C. elegans expressing the reporter transgene showed fluorescence in embryo, larval, and adult stages (Fig. 2). Embryonic reporter gene activity was observed around the time of gastrulation and continued throughout development (Fig. 2, A–D). Strong fluorescence was observed in the intestinal cells of larvae and adults, and this was particularly enhanced in the cells of the posterior gut (Fig. 2E). Larval and adult fluorescence was also observed in neuronal cell bodies around the nerve ring and in processes extending toward the tip of the nose, indicative of them being the amphid sensory neurons (Fig. 2F). The expression pattern in males was determined by mating males (N2, Bristol strain) with hermaphrodites expressing the pam-1::gfp transgene. In addition to the components described above, adult males showed transgene neuronal expression in the developing and mature male tail (Fig. 2, G and H). pam-1 Has Roles in Embryogenesis and Reproduction—RNA interference was carried out by allowing the RNAi-sensitive mutant rrf-3 to feed on bacteria expressing dsRNA targeting exons 1 and 2 of the pam-1 gene. The F1 larvae appeared to develop normally to adulthood. During the initial 24-h time period of self-fertility, a small number of oocytes were laid by RNAi-treated nematodes, whereas oocytes were never observed on control plates during this time period (data not shown). During the second and third 24-h time periods of self-fertility, the frequency of oocytes laid by RNAi-treated animals was significantly greater (Student's t test, p < 0.0001) than by nematodes fed on E. coli not expressing dsRNA (Fig. 3A). The penetrance of the phenotype was ∼60%, and overall, ∼10-fold more oocytes were laid by animals subjected to dsRNA (243 ± 7, n = 20) than controls (24 ± 3, n = 7). The brood size for the group of nematodes exposed to dsRNA (79 ± 3, mean ± S.E.; n = 20) was not significantly different when compared to that of the control group (79 ± 6, mean ± S.E.; n = 7) (Fig. 3B). In addition to the high numbers of oocytes laid by RNAi-treated hermaphrodites, it was also noted that embryonic lethality occurred (penetrance of ∼30%, n = 40). On closer inspection, embryogenesis appeared to arrest during gastrulation, generating a mass of undifferentiated cells (Fig. 3C). Expression and Purification of Recombinant PAM-1—The cDNA encoding PAM-1 was subcloned into pBAD/His C to allow induced expression in E. coli TOP10 of a 6× His tag/Xpress leader/F49E8.3 fusion protein. The recombinant protein was overexpressed into the bacterial insoluble fraction and to a lesser extent the soluble fraction, but it could not be purified by affinity chromatography due to weak interaction with the Ni-NTA resin. Manipulation of the construct by mutagenesis generated a plasmid (pLS35) for the inducible expression of a 105-kDa 10× His tag/Xpress leader/PAM-1 fusion protein. The solubility characteristics were not altered by the additional His residues (Fig. 4A), and Ni-NTA affinity chromatography utilizing native purification conditions allowed ∼0.6 mg of recombinant protein to be purified from 1 liter of bacterial culture (Fig. 4B). A single species of 105 kDa, corresponding to the predicted size of the fusion protein, was detected by Western blotting with the anti-6× His tag antibody (Fig. 4C). Biochemical Characterization of PAM-1—The substrate specificity of the recombinant PAM-1 was studied using amino acid methyl coumarins. Of the substrates tested, those with the highest hydrolytic efficiency (k cat /Km) were Arg-AMC and Lys-AMC, followed by Leu-AMC, Ala-AMC, Met-AMC, Tyr-AMC, Phe-AMC, Gly-AMC, and Ser-AMC (Table I). Hydrolysis of Pro-, Glu-, and Asp-AMC substrates was not detected. The optimal pH for hydrolysis of Leu-AMC was between 7.2 and 7.6.Table IKinetic constants for the hydrolysis of amino acid AMC substrates by PAM-1AMC substrateKmKcatK cat/Kmμ ms-1s-1m-1 × 103Arg340.26.7Lys780.56.2Leu630.46.1Ala970.44.2Met590.23.1Tyr730.11.8Phe1600.21.1Gly3900.40.9Ser8400.30.3 Open table in a new tab Effect of Inhibitors—The inhibitor profile of PAM-1 was determined by measuring the rate of hydrolysis of Arg-AMC in the presence of different inhibitors (Table II). The recombinant PAM-1 was insensitive to inhibition by the serine protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the cysteine protease inhibitor, E-64. In contrast, the enzyme was sensitive to the chelating agent, 1,10-phenanthroline, as would be expected for a metallopeptidase. The aminopeptidase inhibitors actinonin, amastatin, and leuhistin were the most potent inhibitors of PAM-1 (IC50 values 0.1–0.6 μm). Puromycin inhibited the enzyme with an IC50 value of 135 μm (Fig. 5).Table IIEffect of inhibitors on the activity of PAM-1 toward Arg-AMCInhibitorIC50μ mActinonin0.1Amastatin0.2Leuhistin0.6Apstatin22Bestatin25Puromycin135Arphamenine131Phenanthroline155 Open table in a new tab Metal Ion Reactivation of PAM-1—Following complete inactivation of PAM-1 in 4 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, enzyme activity was recovered by addition of Zn2+, Ni2+, and Co2+ (Fig. 6). Zn2+ was the most effective ion, restoring the greatest enzyme activity at all concentrations between 1 and 180 μm. No restoration of enzyme activity was obtained using Cu2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, and Hg2+ at concentrations between 0.001 and 2 mm. The present study describes the role of the puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase, PAM-1, in the biology of the free-living nematode C. elegans. The expression pattern analysis shows that PAM-1 is expressed throughout development, and the neuronal component is consistent with PSA localization reported for other organisms (4Osada T. Ikegami S.

This may reflect an evolutionary conserved role for PSA in the processing of neuropeptides. The precise nature of such a role remains controversial, although studies with mammalian brain thimet oligopeptidase, and neurolysin, demonstrate that cytosolic metallopeptidases are able to function in neuropeptide metabolism (32Shrimpton C.N. Smith A.I. Lew R.A. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 647-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). One possibility is that PAM-1, which appears to lack a signal sequence, may enter the secretory pathway by a non-classic mechanism, as described for thimet oligopeptidase (33Ferro E.S. Tullai J.W. Glucksman M.J. Roberts J.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and neurolysin (34Vincent B. Beaudet A. Dauch P. Vincent J.P. Checler F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5049-5059Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The alternative possibility is that neuropeptides are internalized into neuronal cells by surface receptors, as demonstrated for neurotensin (35Nguyen H.M. Cahill C.M. McPherson P.S. Beaudet A.

https://openalex.org/W2003995467,"Erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) activation is crucial for mature red blood cell production. The murine EpoR can also be activated by the envelope protein of the polycythemic (P) spleen focus forming virus (SFFV), gp55-P. Due to differences in the TM sequence, gp55 of the anemic (A) strain SFFV, gp55-A, cannot efficiently activate the EpoR. Using antibody-mediated immunofluorescence co-patching, we show that the majority of EpoR forms hetero-oligomers at the cell surface with gp55-P and, surprisingly, with gp55-A. The EpoR TM domain is targeted by gp55-P and -A, as only chimeric receptors containing EpoR TM sequences oligomerized with gp55 proteins. Both gp55-P and gp55-A are homodimers on the cell surface, as shown by co-patching. However, when the homomeric interactions of the isolated TM domains were assayed by TOXCAT bacterial reporter system, only the TM sequence of gp55-P was dimerized. Thus, homo-oligomerization of gp55 proteins is insufficient for full EpoR activation, and a correct conformation of the dimer in the TM region is required. This is supported by the failure of gp55-A→P, a mutant protein whose TM domain can homo-oligomerize, to fully activate EpoR. As unliganded EpoR forms TM-dependent but inactive homodimers, we propose that the EpoR can be activated to different extents by homodimeric gp55 proteins, depending on the conformation of the gp55 protein dimer in the TM region.

EpoR belongs to the homodimerizing subclass of the cytokine receptor superfamily. These receptors function as ligand-induced or ligand-stabilized homodimers (1Watowich S.S. Wu H. Socolovsky M. Klingmuller U. Constantinescu S.N. Lodish H.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 91-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Epo binding triggers auto- or trans-phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) bound to the receptor cytosolic (CT) domain (2Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Yi T. Tang B. Miura O. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1993; 74: 227-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar), activating JAK kinase activity toward a variety of substrates, such as the receptors themselves, signal transducers and activators of transcription proteins, and a variety of cytosolic signaling molecules (3Constantinescu S.N. Ghaffari S. Lodish H.F. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 18-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). A number of studies have pointed to the possibility that the EpoR may form dimers prior to Epo binding (4Livnah O. Stura E.A. Middleton S.A. Johnson D.L. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1999; 283: 987-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 5Remy I. Wilson I.A. Michnick S.W. Science. 1999; 283: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 6Constantinescu S.N.

We have shown recently that in transfected HEK293-derived cells the majority of the EpoRs is present at the plasma membrane as preformed homo-oligomers (most likely dimers) that do not signal in the absence of Epo; this homodimerization was mediated by the EpoR transmembrane (TM) domain (6Constantinescu S.N. Keren T. Socolovsky M. Nam H. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4379-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that Epo binding to the extracellular (EC) domain is transmitted to pre-bound JAK2 via key juxtamembrane (JM) residues, some of which are responsible for binding JAK2 and others for its switching on (7Huang L.J. Constantinescu S.N. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1327-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 8Constantinescu S.N. Huang L.J. Nam H. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the JM domain contains a conserved hydrophobic motif that is α-helically oriented by the TM α-helix (8Constantinescu S.N. Huang L.J. Nam H. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Therefore, the EpoR TM domain, shown to homodimerize in a sequence-specific manner (9Gurezka R. Laage R. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9265-9270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 10Kubatzky K.F. Ruan W. Gurezka R. Cohen J. Ketteler R. Watowich S.S. Neumann D. Langosch D. Klingmuller U. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 110-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), seems to be involved in assembling ligand-independent homodimers, in keeping those inactive, and in orienting the JM domain of the ligand-bound EpoR properly for transmitting the signal to JAK2. Strikingly, the EpoR TM domain seems also to be required for pathologic activation of the EpoR by co-expression of the gp55 envelope protein of the polycythemic strain of the spleen focus forming virus (SFFV) (11Zon L.I.

Henis Y.I. Smith S.O. Lodish H.F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3334-3347Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Two different strains of SFFV have been identified, the polycythemic (P) and the anemic (A) (13Mirand E.A. Steeves R.A. Lange R.D. Grace Jr., J.T. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1968; 128: 844-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14Ben-David Y. Bernstein A. Cell. 1991; 66: 831-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Both P and A strains trigger erythroleukemia (EL) (15Friend C. J. Exp. Med. 1957; 105: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 16Moreau-Gachelin F. Ray D. de Both N.J. van der Feltz M.J. Tambourin P. Tavitian A. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1990; 4: 20-23PubMed Google Scholar) via expression of their envelope proteins, gp55-P and -A, respectively (17Wolff L. Ruscetti S. Science. 1985; 228: 1549-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Ruscetti S.K. Baillieres Clin. Haematol. 1995; 8: 225-247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19Kabat D. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1989; 148: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A major player in triggering erythroid expansion by Friend virus infection is represented by a truncated form of the stem cell kinase receptor (sf-Stk) (20Persons D.A. Paulson R.F. Loyd M.R. Herley M.T. Bodner S.M. Bernstein A. Correll P.H. Ney P.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). SFFV-P induces EL and polycythemia (massive increase in the number of mature red cells), whereas SFFV-A induces EL and anemia, due to hemodilution (21Tambourin P.E. Wendling F. Jasmin C. Smadja-Joffe F. Leuk. Res. 1979; 3: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because co-expression of gp55-P and EpoR in cytokine-dependent Ba/F3 cells, which lack sf-Stk, results in factor independence (22Li J.-P. D'Andrea A.D. Lodish H.F. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 343: 762-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 23Ruscetti S.K. Janesch N.J. Chakraborti A. Sawyer S.T. Hankins W.D. J.

Virol. 2001; 75: 7893-7903Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), it was proposed that induction of polycythemia associated with EL can occur through an alternative mechanism, involving EpoR activation by gp55-P. The close proximity of gp55-P to the EpoR was initially demonstrated by cross-linking of 125I-Epo to gp55-P (26Casadevall N. Lacombe C. Muller O. Gisselbrecht S. Mayeux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16015-16020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). gp55-P must be at the cell surface in order to activate the EpoR (27Ferro Jr., F. Kozak S.L. Hoatlin M.E. Kabat D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5741-5747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Tarr K. Watowich S.S. Longmore G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9099-9107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, the putative cell-surface complex between EpoR and gp55-P has not yet been visualized. The polycythemic effects of gp55-P are due to sequences at the 3′ end of the gp55 gene, which encode the TM domain (29Chung S.W. Wolff L. Ruscetti S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7957-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Studies employing chimeric receptors showed that the TM domain of the EpoR is required for the polycythemic effects of gp55-P (11Zon L.I. Moreau J.F. Koo J.W. Mathey-Prevot B. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2949-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The TM domains of gp55-P and -A differ by several point mutations and an insertion of two extra Leu residues (Leu396 and Leu397) in gp55-P (29Chung S.W. Wolff L. Ruscetti S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7957-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). gp55-P loses its ability to induce a polycythemic phenotype if Met390 is mutated to Ile (the corresponding sequence in gp55-A) or if Leu397 or Leu396 and Leu397 are deleted from its TM sequence (12Constantinescu S.N. Liu X. Beyer W. Fallon A. Shekar S. Henis Y.I. Smith S.O. Lodish H.F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3334-3347Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 30Fang C. Choi E. Nie L. Li J.P. Virology. 1998; 252: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Such mutants whose phenotypes are altered from P to A are designated gp55-P→A mutants. The activation of murine EpoR by gp55-P requires Ser238 of the EpoR TM domain (12Constantinescu S.N. Liu X. Beyer W. Fallon A. Shekar S. Henis Y.I. Smith S.O. Lodish H.F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3334-3347Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Based on molecular dynamics simulations, we propose that a specific interaction between the TM domains requires an interface containing Ser238 of the EpoR TM domain and Met390 of the gp55-P TM domain (12Constantinescu S.N. Liu X. Beyer W. Fallon A. Shekar S. Henis Y.I. Smith S.O. Lodish H.F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3334-3347Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which expression of gp55-A induces EL has remained unclear, because gp55-A does not render the proliferation of EpoR-expressing cells factor-independent (31Showers M.O. De Martino J.C. Saito Y. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and only infection with SFFV-P, but not with SFFV-A, induces the formation of erythroid bursts from bone marrow (32Hankins W.D. Troxler D. Cell. 1980; 22: 693-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We have shown recently that gp55-A induces fetal liver colony-forming unit-erythroid progenitors to differentiate into red cell colonies in the absence of Epo and that this effect requires expression of the EpoR (33Constantinescu S.N. Wu H. Liu X. Beyer W. Fallon A. Lodish H.F. Blood. 1998; 91: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike gp55-P, gp55-A cannot stimulate earlier progenitors, burst-forming unit-erythroid, to survive, proliferate, and differentiate into mature red cell colonies (33Constantinescu S.N. Wu H. Liu X. Beyer W. Fallon A. Lodish H.F. Blood. 1998; 91: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We proposed that the polycythemic phenotype may be related to the ability of gp55-P to expand early burst-forming unit-erythroid progenitors. Here we show that complexes between EpoR and gp55-P can be visualized on the surface of live transfected cells by antibody-mediated immunofluorescence co-patching. The interaction between EpoR and gp55-P is specific because gp55-P did not oligomerize with other related receptors, such as thrombopoietin (TpoR) or prolactin (PrlR) receptors. By using chimeric EpoR-PrlR constructs containing either the EC, TM, or CT EpoR segments, we show that the EpoR TM domain is the target of gp55-P. Unexpectedly, gp55-A also formed heteromeric complexes with the cell-surface EpoRs, and the target of the gp55-A interactions was also the EpoR TM domain. By using TOXCAT genetic assays we show that the isolated TM sequence of gp55-P but not of gp55-A has homodimerizing ability, although both full-length gp55 proteins are present at the cell surface as homo-oligomers. Thus, gp55 homodimerization is not sufficient for full EpoR activation, as suggested also by the finding that insertion of two extra Leu residues in the TM sequence of gp55-A to resemble gp55-P (the mutant is designated gp55-A Ins Leu396, Leu397) resulted in a TM sequence which homo-oligomerized, but still failed to fully activate the EpoR. These results show that the dimeric EpoR TM domain, which normally maintains the unliganded EpoR in an inactive dimeric state, is the target of both oncogenic gp55-P and -A protein dimers. Generation of EpoR Mutant Plasmids—The cDNA encoding SFFV gp55 proteins, all cloned into SFFV cDNA, was kindly provided by Dr. Sandra K. Ruscetti, NCI, Frederick, MD. SFFVAP-L, which exerts effects identical to SFFV-P, was denoted gp55-P and is in fact gp55-APP, as described (33Constantinescu S.N. Wu H. Liu X. Beyer W. Fallon A. Lodish H.F. Blood. 1998; 91: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant gp55-P M390I, in the same vector, was described (12Constantinescu S.N. Liu X. Beyer W. Fallon A. Shekar S. Henis Y.I. Smith S.O. Lodish H.F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3334-3347Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The cDNAs coding for mutant gp55 proteins have been cloned in SFFV as described (12Constantinescu S.N. Liu X. Beyer W. Fallon A. Shekar S. Henis Y.I. Smith S.O. Lodish H.F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3334-3347Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For epitope-tagging gp55-P and gp55-A, DNA sequences encoding the HA (YPYDVPDY) or Myc (EQKLISEEDL) tags were inserted by PCR just downstream of the signal peptidase cleavage site predicted by the SignalP program (34Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar). The murine EpoR cDNA was cloned in the pMX-IRES-GFP 1.1 bicistronic retroviral vector upstream of the IRES as described (12Constantinescu S.N. Liu X. Beyer W. Fallon A. Shekar S. Henis Y.I. Smith S.O. Lodish H.F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3334-3347Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The level of GFP expression from these vectors is proportional over a 50-fold range to the level of expression of the protein encoded by the cDNA placed upstream of IRES (35Liu X. Constantinescu S.N. Sun Y. Bogan J.S. Hirsch D. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The rabbit PrlR cDNA and the cDNA coding the CHI PrlR-EpoR chimeric construct (the EC domain of PrlR fused to the TM and CT domains of the murine EpoR) cloned in MSCV (36Dusanter-Fourt I. Muller O. Ziemiecki A. Mayeux P. Drucker B. Djiane J. Wilks A. Harpur A.G. Fischer S. Gisselbrecht S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2583-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Isabelle Dusanter-Fourt, Hôpital Cochin, Paris, France. They were tagged by replacing the signal peptide with a signal peptide from pFLAG-CMV-1 (Eastman Kodak Co.) followed by the sequence encoding two FLAG epitopes. The tagged receptors were cloned in pMX-IRES-GFP 1.1. In the resulting FLAG-tagged CHI PrlR-EpoR construct, the PrlR EC domain, ending in 206FT-MKD210, is followed by the EpoR TM (starting with Leu226) and CT segments, as described for the original PrlR-EpoR chimeric construct (36Dusanter-Fourt I. Muller O. Ziemiecki A. Mayeux P. Drucker B. Djiane J. Wilks A. Harpur A.G. Fischer S. Gisselbrecht S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2583-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We designate this construct FLAG-PEE, following nomenclature relating to the receptors (P, PrlR; E, EpoR) from which the EC, TM and CT segments, in that order, were derived (see Fig. 2). The precise junctions in the different chimeric receptors (FLAG-PEP, FLAG-PPE, and untagged EPP) have been described (6Constantinescu S.N. Keren T. Socolovsky M. Nam H. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4379-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The cDNA of FLAG-tagged murine TpoR (also known as c-mpl), cloned in pcDNA3, was a gift from Amgen. Antibodies—Rat monoclonal 7C10 IgG against gp55 was a generous gift from Dr. Sandra Ruscetti. Goat anti-gp55 polyclonal antibodies (National Cancer Institute repository) were kindly made available by Quality Biotech Inc. Rabbit C-189 antibodies against the EC domain of murine EpoR (anti-EpoR) were described previously (37Yoshimura A. D'Andrea A.D. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4139-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Rabbit antibodies against the murine TpoR (anti-TpoR) were from Amgen. Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 IgG (anti-FLAG) was from Sigma. Rabbit HA.11 against the HA tag (anti-HA) and mouse monoclonal 9E10 anti-Myc tag were from Covance. Biotinylated goat anti-rat IgG (GαRat) minimized for cross-reactivity against mouse serum proteins, FITC-coupled donkey anti-mouse IgG minimized against rat serum proteins, FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (GαR), Cy3-goat anti-mouse IgG (GαM), and Cy3-streptavidin were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Rabbit antibodies to maltose-binding protein (anti-MBP) were from New England Biolabs. Immunofluorescence Co-patching of Cell-surface Proteins—To measure heteromeric complex formation between EpoR and gp55 proteins, or homomeric complex formation of gp55 proteins directly at the cell surface, we employed antibody-mediated immunofluorescence co-patching of antigenically distinct membrane proteins, as we described recently (38Henis Y.I. Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 39Gilboa L. Wells R.G. Lodish H.F. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 40Gilboa L. Nohe A. Geissendorfer T. Sebald W. Henis Y.I. Knaus P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). BOSC23 cells grown on glass coverslips were transiently co-transfected using calcium phosphate with gp55-P and gp55-A or mutants together with either EpoR, FLAG-PrlR, chimeric constructs of the two receptors, differently tagged gp55 constructs, or other control cDNAs in mammalian expression vectors. After 48–72 h, live cells were incubated with normal goat IgG (200 μg/ml, 45 min, 4 °C, in HBSS containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 1% bovine serum albumin) to block nonspecific IgG binding. In experiments on heterocomplex formation between a gp55 protein and a receptor (for antibody labeling in gp55 homo-oligomerization studies, see Fig. 4), this was followed by successive incubations (4 °C, 45 min each, with 3 washes between incubations, all carried out in the cold to avoid internalization and enable exclusive cell surface labeling) with the following: (a) rat anti-gp55 7C10 IgG (50 μg/ml) together with a primary antibody against the co-transfected receptor (rabbit anti-EpoR, 50 μg/ml; mouse anti-FLAG, 20 μg/ml; or rabbit anti-TpoR, 5 μg/ml); (b) biotinylated GαRat (20 μg/ml, to enhance patching of gp55) together with FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (30 μg/ml) to label and patch the co-transfected receptor (FITC-GαR for primary rabbit antibodies or FITC-donkey anti-mouse IgG for the mouse anti-FLAG to label FLAG-tagged proteins); (c) Cy3-streptavidin (1.3 μg/ml) to label and further patch the biotinylated GαRat bound to the 7C10 IgG, whose patching capability is lower. The protocol results in red-labeled gp55, whereas the co-expressed receptors are labeled with green fluorescence. After washing, the cells were fixed in methanol (5 min, -20 °C) and acetone (2 min, -20 °C), thereby denaturing GFP and eliminating its fluorescence, and mounted in Slow-Fade (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence digital images were recorded using a CCD camera as described (40Gilboa L. Nohe A. Geissendorfer T. Sebald W. Henis Y.I. Knaus P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The FITC and Cy3 images were exported in TIFF format to Photoshop (Adobe) and superimposed. The numbers of red, green, and yellow (superimposed red and green) patches were counted on the computer screen, in each case counting at least 100 patches per cell on 10–15 cells. Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—BOSC23 cells grown in 10-cm dishes were transiently co-transfected with vectors encoding gp55-A or gp55-P together with either FLAG-PrlR, FLAG-PEP, Myc-EpoR, or Myc-EPP using the Profection kit (Promega). After 48 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice (1 h) in lysis buffer containing 1% Brij97 (Sigma). Immunoprecipitation of gp55 proteins was carried out using anti-gp55 antibodies bound to protein G-Sepharose (Sigma). Samples were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with anti-FLAG or anti-Myc IgG (5 μg/ml) followed by peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences); detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Infection of Ba/F3 Cells and Epo-dependent Proliferation Assays— For infection of Ba/F3 cells with retroviruses, high titer replication-defective retroviral supernatants were generated as described (35Liu X. Constantinescu S.N. Sun Y. Bogan J.S. Hirsch D. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). First, Ba/F3 cell pools expressing the murine EpoR (Ba/F3-EpoR) were isolated by infecting interleukin 3 (IL3)-dependent Ba/F3 cells with retroviruses encoding EpoR in the pMX-IRES-GFP1.1 vector. Infection was on cells growing in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, antibiotics (100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin), and 5% supernatant of WEHI cell line as a source of IL3. EpoR-expressing cells were isolated after washing the cells 4 times in RPMI 1640 and selection by growing (7–9 days) in medium without IL3 but with 1 unit/ml Epo. The EpoR-expressing cells were subjected to a second round of retroviral infection as above, this time with retroviruses generated using gp55 constructs cloned into SFFV cDNA. After washing 4 times with RPMI 1640, they were assayed for growth factor independence by growing 4 days in the absence of both IL3 and Epo in RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum, as described (33Constantinescu S.N. Wu H. Liu X. Beyer W. Fallon A. Lodish H.F. Blood. 1998; 91: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). High expression of gp55 proteins was demonstrated by Western blotting of cell lysates using a goat anti-gp55 antibody, as described (12Constantinescu S.N. Liu X. Beyer W. Fallon A. Shekar S. Henis Y.I. Smith S.O. Lodish H.F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3334-3347Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 33Constantinescu S.N. Wu H. Liu X. Beyer W. Fallon A. Lodish H.F. Blood. 1998; 91: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TOXCAT Assays—TOXCAT chimeras containing TM sequences corresponding to the gp55-P TM residues Leu385–Leu403 (LISTIMGSLIILLLLLILL), the gp55-A TM residues Leu385–Leu401 (LVSTIIGSLIILILILL), or the TM residues of the gp55-A Ins Leu396, Leu397 mutant, which is gp55-A with an insertion of two extra Leu residues to resemble gp55-P (Leu385–Leu403; LVSTIIGSLIILLLILILL), were generated by PCR amplification of oligonucleotides encoding the TM regions. The PCR products were cloned into pccKAN (41Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) as NheI/DpnII fragments. The resulting plasmids were transformed into NT326 cells (42Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar) and grown as described previously. TOXCAT chimeras with TM sequences derived from glycophorin A or its G83I mutant (41Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) were used as controls. Expression levels of the chimeras were assayed using anti-MBP immunoblotting. Membrane insertion of the chimeras was verified by survival on M9-maltose medium (not shown), indicating periplasmic localization of the MBP domain. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays of cell extracts were performed using the Quan-T-CAT kit (Amersham Biosciences). Cell-surface EpoR and gp55-P Form Heteromeric Complexes—In order to detect the formation of heteromeric complexes between the murine EpoR and gp55-P at the surface of live cells, we co-expressed these proteins in HEK293-derived BOSC23 cells and employed the immunofluorescence co-patching method. In this method (detailed in Ref. 40Gilboa L. Nohe A. Geissendorfer T. Sebald W. Henis Y.I. Knaus P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), two membrane proteins recognized by different primary antibodies from different animal species are co-expressed at the surface of live cells. One protein is forced into micropatches by a double layer of bivalent IgGs using a fluorescent secondary antibody. The co-expressed protein, which is antigenically distinct and recognized by a different antibody, is patched and labeled by primary antibodies from another species and secondary antibodies coupled to another fluorophore, or by biotinylated secondary IgG followed by a fluorescent streptavidin derivative. Membrane proteins residing in mutual oligomers will be swept into the same micropatches. If one uses red (e.g. Cy3) and green (FITC) fluorophores, mutual patches appear yellow when the two images are overlapped. Fig. 1 shows typical results of co-patching experiments aimed at analyzing the oligomerization state of the EpoR and gp55-P; the average data from many such experiments are depicted in Fig. 3. Fig. 1A demonstrates that the majority (∼80%; see Fig. 3) of cell-surface EpoR and gp55-P are present in mutual (yellow) patches. This co-patching is specific because gp55-P did not co-patch effectively with the related TpoR or PrlR, with most patches being either red or green (Fig. 1, B and C). These low levels of co-patching (25–30%; see Fig. 3) presumably represent the basal level of copatching due to the cumulative contribution of factors other than specific oligomeric interactions (e.g. accidental overlap of patches, co-localization due to mutual association within specialized subcellular or membrane domains, or nonspecific interactions). As shown in Fig. 1A and quantified in Fig. 3, about 80% of the patches contain both EpoR and gp55-P. This high percentage suggests that the majority of the EpoR and gp55-P proteins present at the cell surface reside in mutual complexes. This interaction is also validated by co-immunoprecipitation of EpoR with gp55-P (see Fig. 7).Fig"
https://openalex.org/W2075624085,"Kv channel-interacting proteins (KChIPs) and neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) have been shown to interact with Kv4 channel α-subunits to regulate the expression and/or gating of these channels. Here we examine the specificity and sites of these proteins for interaction with Kv channel proteins. Immunoprecipitation and green fluorescent protein imaging show that KChIPs (but not NCS-1) effectively bind to Kv4.3 protein and localize at the plasma membrane when channel proteins are coexpressed. Analysis with chimeric proteins between KChIP2 and NCS-1 reveals that the three regions of KChIP2 (the linker between the first and second EF hands, the one between the third and fourth EF hands, and the C-terminal peptide after the fourth EF hand) are necessary and sufficient for its effective binding to Kv4.3 protein. The chimera with these three KChIP2 portions slowed inactivation and facilitated recovery from inactivation of Kv4.3 current. These results indicate that the sequence difference in these three regions between KChIPs and NCS-1 determines the specificity and affinity for interaction with Kv4 protein. Because the three identified regions surround the large hydrophobic crevice based on the NCS-1 crystal structure, this crevice may be the association site of KChIPs for the channel protein."
https://openalex.org/W1981018868,"The RNA polymerase III initiation factor TFIIIB is assembled onto DNA through interactions involving the Tfc4 subunit of the assembly factor TFIIIC and two subunits of TFIIIB, Brf1 and Bdp1. Tfc4 contains two arrays of tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), each of which provides a binding site for Brf1. Dominant mutations in the ligand binding channel of the first TPR array, TPRs1–5, and on the back side of this array, increase Brf1 binding by Tfc4. Here we examine the biological importance of the second TPR array, TPRs6 –9. Radical mutations at phylogenetically conserved residues in the ligand binding channel of TPRs6 –9 impair pol III reporter gene transcription. Biochemical studies on one such mutation, L469K in TPR7, revealed a defect in the recruitment of Brf1 into TFIIIB-TFIIIC-DNA complexes and diminished the direct interaction between Tfc4 and Brf1. Multicopy suppression analysis implicates TPR9 in Brf1 binding and TPRs7 and 8 in binding to more than one ligand. Indeed, the L469K mutation also decreased the binding affinity for Bdp1 incorporation into TFIIIB-TFIIIC-DNA complexes and inhibited binary interactions between Bdp1 and Tfc4. The Bdp1 binding domain in Tfc4 was mapped to TPRs1–9, a domain that contains both TPR arrays and thus overlaps two of the known binding sites for Brf1. The properties of the L469K mutation identify both Brf1 and Bdp1 as ligands for the second TPR array. The RNA polymerase III initiation factor TFIIIB is assembled onto DNA through interactions involving the Tfc4 subunit of the assembly factor TFIIIC and two subunits of TFIIIB, Brf1 and Bdp1.

Biochemical and genetic studies in yeast indicate that the recruitment of Brf1 by TFIIIC is a major limiting step in preinitiation complex assembly (5Lopez-de-Leon A. Librizzi M. Puglia K.

Subsequent binding of the TBP and Bdp1 subunits of TFIIIB generates a series of structural changes in Tfc4, Brf1 and DNA that leads to progressively increased accessibility of Brf1 to DNA (8Kassavetis G.A.

The protein-protein interactions between TFIIIB subunits, together with DNA bending, generate a highly stable TFIIIB complex, a structure that surrounds and kinetically traps the DNA (9Kassavetis G.A.

TPR motifs, as the name implies, are typically 34 amino acids in length and fold into two antiparallel α-helices (designated A and B, Ref. 15Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Although no position within the motif is invariant, a pattern of small and large hydrophobic residues defines the loose TPR consensus and provides stacking interactions between adjacent repeats (15Das A.K.

Multiple adjacent repeats form a right-handed superhelix in which the inner channel (formed by the A-helices) provides a ligand binding interface (18Gatto Jr., G.J. Geisbrecht B.V. Gould S.J.

The TPRs in Tfc4 are organized into two arrays in the N terminus, TPR1–5 and TPR6 –9 (with five and four repeats, respectively) that are separated by a region of minimal sequence conservation, and two solo repeats in the C terminus (depicted in Fig. 1 and Refs. 13Marck C.

Conservation of the number of TPRs and their organization in Tfc4 orthologues suggests that the function of the protein is based on the preservation of a common TPR-based tertiary structure (21Dumay-Odelot H. Acker J. Arrebola R. Sentenac A. Marck C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 298-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The TPR motifs of Tfc4 contain multiple independent binding sites for Brf1 (3Hsieh Y.J. Wang Z. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell.

The N-terminal region of Tfc4 in combination with the first repeat (Nt-TPR1) can support Brf1 binding, as detected by a two-hybrid interaction (1Chaussivert N. Conesa C. Shaaban S. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15353-15358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), although the first array (TPRs1–5) is minimally sufficient in the absence of the Nt-region (23Moir R.D. Puglia K.V. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The second TPR array (TPRs6 –9) contributes an additional binding site for Brf1 (3Hsieh Y.J. Wang Z. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell.

The ligand binding activity of TPRs10 and 11 is unclear since the C-terminal region is neither required for nor independently binds Brf1 in a two-hybrid assay (1Chaussivert N. Conesa C. Shaaban S. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15353-15358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) yet binds Brf1 in a pull-down assay (22Khoo B. Brophy B. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2879-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The N-terminal half of Tfc4 (Nt-TPR9) forms a structure that is largely stable to limited proteolysis and binds Brf1 in solution, in Far-Western and two-hybrid assays (1Chaussivert N. Conesa C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26591-26598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Yet the apparent Brf1-binding affinity of the Nt-TPR9 region is lower than that of either smaller Brf1-binding region (Nt-TPR5 and TPR6 –9) (23Moir R.D. Puglia K.V. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the Brf1 binding sites are masked in the context of the Nt-TPR9 region (23Moir R.D. Puglia K.V. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and indeed the entire Tfc4 protein (1Chaussivert N. Conesa C. Shaaban S. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15353-15358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A study of the human homolog of Tfc4 (hT-FIIIC102) (3Hsieh Y.J. Wang Z. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4944-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) showed that repeats in each TPR array bind to both HsBrf1 and hTFIIIC63 (the homolog of S. cerevisiae Tfc1 that together with Tfc4 and Tfc7 form the τA domain of TFIIIC) (25Schultz P. Marzouki N. Marck C. Ruet A. Oudet P. Sentenac A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3815-3824Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The TPRs also contribute to the interaction between Tfc4 and the TFIIIB subunit Bdp1. Although the Bdp1-binding site(s) in Tfc4 has not yet been defined, analysis of deletion mutants of Tfc4 (21Dumay-Odelot H. Acker J. Arrebola R. Sentenac A. Marck C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 298-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 26Ruth J. Conesa C. Dieci G. Lefebvre O. Dusterhoft A. Ottonello S. Sentenac A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1941-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and the effect of amino acid substitutions in both TPR2 (27Ishiguro A Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3264-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and TPR7 (28Rozenfeld S. Thuriaux P. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; : 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) suggest that the TPR arrays are involved in the association between Tfc4 and Bdp1. The TPRs in Tfc4 may therefore provide binding sites for multiple ligands. A phylogenetic analysis of the first array in Tfc4, TPRs1–5, found that the conserved non-structural TPR residues are distributed between the A and B helices and loop regions of the repeats (23Moir R.D. Puglia K.V. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Dominant gain of function mutations in Tfc4 map in and around TPR2 and increase the recruitment of Brf1 to TFIIIC-DNA (6Moir R.D. Sethy-Coraci I. Puglia K. Librizzi M.D. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7119-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A structural model of TPRs1–3 showed that the conserved residues and sites of the gain of function mutations cluster into two potential binding sites: one that traverses the ligand binding channel and another that lies across the back side of the array (29Moir R.D. Willis I.M. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. The Assembly of the Initiation Factor TFIIIB. Academic Press, New York2004Google Scholar). Biochemical studies of the T167I (PCF1–2) gain of function mutation show that the channel formed by TPRs1–3 binds Brf1 directly. 2R. Moir, K. Puglia, Y. Liao, and I. Willis, manuscript in preparation.2R. Moir, K. Puglia, Y. Liao, and I. Willis, manuscript in preparation. In contrast, characterization of the H190Y(PCF1-1) mutation shows that Brf1 does not interact on the back side of the TPR1–5 array. This latter mutation is proposed to affect an intramolecular interaction that indirectly influences Brf1 binding, leading to relief of autoinhibition (23Moir R.D. Puglia K.V. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Unlike the first TPR array, the conserved non-structural residues in TPRs6 –9 map predominantly to the A-helices (23Moir R.D. Puglia K.V. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of TPRs6 –9 to bind Brf1 in vitro suggests that these conserved residues form a binding site for Brf1. This was confirmed in the current study by in vivo and in vitro analysis of mutations at specific sites in the second TPR array. We show that conserved residues in TPRs6 –9 cluster into two groups; one in TPR9 that affects Brf1 binding and the other in TPRs7 and 8 that generates a more complex effect on ligand binding. Biochemical studies on one mutant, L469K in TPR7, reveals effects on two steps in complex assembly; Brf1 and Bdp1 incorporation into TFIIIB-TFIIIC-DNA complexes. The minimal region of Tfc4 required for detectable Bdp1 binding in our assays was mapped to TPRs1–9, a region previously defined as containing two binding sites for Brf1. We discuss the implications of two ligands, Brf1 and Bdp1, apparently competing for binding to Tfc4, in TFIIIC-directed TFIIIB complex assembly. Mutagenesis of Tfc4 —The Transformer™ Mutagenesis kit (Clonetech) was used to introduce amino acid substitutions at selected positions in TPR7–9 in Tfc4. The following mutagenic primers were used to introduce mutations in the plasmid pRS313/PCF1+ 16E (the underlined nucleotides mark the mutation site(s): L469K, 5′-GACGTTGCGGATAAATATTTTGAGGCTGC-3′; E472K, 5′GTTGCGGATTTATATTTTAAGGCTGCAAC-3′; E498K, 5′GCCGTTGTTATCCCTTAAGGAATGGC-3′; V504K, 5′-GTACCACTGACAAGTTCAAACCACTAGC-3′; C511A, 5′-CCACTAGCAAGAGCCTACAAGGAAATCG-3′; I515K, 5′-GCTACAAGGAAAAGGAAAGTTATGAAACG-3′; D537K, 5′-CCAGATGATTTAAAGATTCGTGTATC-3′; S541I, 5′-GATATTCGTGTAATTTTGGCAGAAGTTTAC-3′; L542G, 5′-GATATTCGTGTATCTGGGGCAGAAGTTTAC-3′ and E564K, 5′-GTTGCGTTGTAAAGATGAGGGAAACACC-3′. The selection primer 5′-GATACCGTCGACGGATCCGGGGGGCCCGGTAC was used to identify successfully mutated plasmids through loss of XhoI and gain of BamH1 (underlined) restriction sites in vector sequence. Candidate clones were retransformed into DH5α and sequenced to confirm the identity of the amino acid substitution. Mutant PCF1 alleles on pRS313 were transformed into the yeast strain supAC1+ that contained a wild-type PCF1+ gene and the pol III reporter gene sup9-e A19-supS1 (14Rameau G. Puglia K. Crowe A.

Single colonies were obtained and assayed for growth and suppression phenotypes at 16, 30 or 37 °C. Strains were grown to early log phase (OD 1.0) in synthetic complete medium before dilution and spotting onto minimally complete or selective media. Each suppressor defective strain was transformed with plasmids that overexpressed either Brf1 (YEp24TDS4, Ref. 30Buratowski S. Zhou H.

TFIIIC-DNA complexes were assembled, with Brf1, TBP and Bdp1 as required in specific experiments, at 20 °C for 60 min before native gel electrophoresis. TPR6 –9 fragments were added to preformed TFIIIC-DNA complexes prior to the addition of Brf1. Protein-Protein Interactions—Recombinant His-tagged Brf1 or Bdp1 was immobilized on NiNTA-resin (Qiagen) in buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 150 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol with protease inhibitors (protein refolding buffer supplemented with 150 mm NaCl, Ref. 31Librizzi M.D. Moir R.D.

Subclones of Tfc4 that encoded untagged versions of the following regions; Nt-TPR9, TPR1–9, TPR6 –9, and TPR1–5, were individually transcribed and translated in vitro (SMLnT®-coupled reticulocyte lysate system, Promega) to generate 35S-labeled proteins. In each 40-μl pull-down reaction, 5 μl of Brf1-(50 pmol) or Bdp1 (12.5 pmol)-bound resin was pre-equilibrated in binding buffer that contained 10 mm imidazole, 3 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30–60 min, before incubation with 5 μl of labeled Tfc4 fragment at 4 °C for 2 h. Resins were then washed three times in binding buffer that contained 15–20 mm imidazole. Control resins, that lacked Brf1 or Bdp1, were processed in parallel. Samples were boiled, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and Tfc4 protein detected by direct autoradiography. Two-hybrid interactions were assayed using Brf1 or Bdp1 in pASCYH2 and wild-type or mutant Tfc4, or the respective subfragments, in pACTII. The resulting β-galactosidase activity in strain Y190, was measured and normalized to protein concentration and expressed as Miller units (units of β-galactosidase activity per mg of protein, Ref. 32Ausubel F.M.

Amino Acid Substitutions at Phylogenetically Conserved Positions in TPRs6 –9 of Tfc4 Generate Defects in pol III Transcription—A phylogenetic analysis of TPRs6 –9 from four yeast and three metazoan species identified four absolutely conserved amino acids, one located in each A-helix of the array at positions that were not predicted to contribute to the TPR-fold (15Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 33Moir R.D. Puglia K.V. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6131-6141Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, a number of highly conserved acidic, basic, and hydrophobic residues were identified. The majority of these residues also mapped to the A-helices in this array (summarized in Fig. 1, adapted from Ref. 23Moir R.D. Puglia K.V. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To examine the functional importance of TPRs6 –9, a subset of ten conserved A- and B-helix residues in the array were chosen for radical site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting mutant genes were plasmid shuffled into S. cerevisiae (strain supAC1+, Ref. 14Rameau G. Puglia K. Crowe A. Sethy I. Willis I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and evaluated for growth at several temperatures on synthetic complete medium and for their ability to express the pol III reporter gene, sup9-e A19-supS1 (34Willis I. Schmidt P. Soll D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4281-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). None of the mutations were lethal at 30 °C since the URA3-marked wild-type rescuing plasmid could be successfully evicted on 5-FOA-containing medium. Moreover, the mutants exhibited growth phenotypes that were indistinguishable from wild-type at 30 °C and 37 °C on nutritionally complete medium (Fig. 2A and data not shown). Several mutants (L469K, E472K, V504K, S541I, and L542G) exhibited reduced growth at 16 °C relative to wild type (Fig. 2A, right panel, labeled in bold). This cold-sensitive slow growth phenotype was most pronounced for the mutation, L469K at position 3 in TPR7. Expression of the sup9-e A19-supS1 reporter gene was monitored at 30 °C by the suppression of auxotrophies in tryptophan and methionine biosynthesis. Since growth differences were not apparent under non-selective conditions at this temperature, differences observed on Trp-Met-medium reflect changes in sup9-e A19-supS1 transcription (34Willis I. Schmidt P. Soll D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4281-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). One mutation, I515K at position 14 in TPR8, conferred a modest increase in suppressor activity implying either the loss of an inhibitory interaction or the acquisition of a positive interaction. However, 5 of 10 mutations (including the L469K mutation) exhibited significantly lower suppressor activity than wild-type (Fig. 2A, middle panel). Whereas wild-type growth was apparent on selective medium after 5 days, the five defective strains did not show significant growth even after 14 days. Consistent with the idea that ligand binding in the second TPR array is important for Tfc4 function in vivo, all of the defective mutations mapped to residues in the A-helices of the repeat (Fig. 1). Previous work has established that transcription of the sup9-e A19-supS1 reporter gene in vivo is sensitive to the level of Brf1 as well as to the Brf1 binding activity of Tfc4 (5Lopez-de-Leon A. Librizzi M. Puglia K. Willis I.M. Cell. 1992; 71: 211-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 6Moir R.D. Sethy-Coraci I. Puglia K. Librizzi M.D. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7119-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 7Sethy-Coraci I. Moir R.D. Lopez-de-Leon A. Willis I.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2344-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 33Moir R.D. Puglia K.V. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6131-6141Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, it was interesting to find that only two of the mutations (S541I and L542G in TPR9, Fig. 2B) showed increased sup9-e A19-supS1 activity in the presence of a multicopy plasmid containing Brf1. The interpretation of multicopy suppression data for presumed loss of function mutations in TFIIIC subunits is not unambiguous in the absence of supporting biochemical studies. The increase in reporter gene expression could indicate that these two mutations have a defect in Brf1 binding that is rescued by elevated Brf1 protein levels. Alternatively, these mutations may cause a defect in a step that precedes Brf1-binding (e.g. TFIIIC-DNA binding). In contrast, sup9-e A19-supS1 expression conferred by the mutations L469K, E472K, and V504K was not increased by overexpression of Brf1 (Fig. 2B) or either of the other two TFIIIB components (see Fig. 2C for L469K and data not shown). The different pattern of multicopy suppression seen for the S541I and L542G mutations in TPR9 versus the L469K, E472K, and V504K mutations, suggests that TPR9 is functionally distinct from TPRs7 and 8 in its ligand interactions. The latter group is most likely affected at more than a single step in transcription complex assembly or function. The presence of non-conserved proline residues in the B-helix of TPR7 and in the A-helix of TPR8 in S. cerevisiae Tfc4 (23Moir R.D. Puglia K.V. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) complicates the construction of a molecular model for the entire TPR6 –9 array. However, the structures of TPRs6 and 7A and TPRs8B and 9 have been successfully modeled and show that residues Leu469 and Glu472 in TPR7, Val504 in TPR8 and Ser541 in TPR9 project into the ligand-binding groove formed by the repeats (29Moir R.D. Willis I.M. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. The Assembly of the Initiation Factor TFIIIB. Academic Press, New York2004Google Scholar). The predicted surface accessibility of Leu469 in the TPR channel together with the cold-sensitive growth phenotype and the pol III transcription defect of the L469K mutation led us to choose this mutant for biochemical analysis. The L469K Mutation in Tfc4 Affects Brf1 Binding in Vitro— The specific activity of TFIIIC fractions prepared from wild-type and L469K extracts were analyzed in parallel for DNA binding and transcription activity (see “Experimental Procedures”). TFIIIC preparations from L469K and wild-type strains were indistinguishable in protein composition (as determined by the abundance of TFIIIC subunits; Tfc4, Tfc1, and Tfc3, data not shown) and yielded comparable TFIIIC-DNA binding activity (data not shown). TFIIIC-DNA complexes were assembled based on the empirically determined DNA binding activity and assayed for the ability to support transcription in a reconstituted system. These transcription reactions contain TFIIIC, RNA polymerase III, and the TFIIIB factors (recombinant TBP and Brf1 and yeast-purified Bdp1). Transcription of the tRNALeu template (shown in Fig. 3) is dependent on TFIIIC (Fig. 3, lane 1) and generates highly reproducible amounts of transcript (duplicate reactions generate standard deviations of less than 10%, data not shown). Quantitation of the transcription products showed a linear dependence on Brf1 levels as reported previously (6Moir R.D. Sethy-Coraci I. Puglia K. Librizzi M.D. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7119-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and regression analysis of the data in Fig. 3 yielded r 2 values of >0.99 (data not shown). Under the conditions employed, the L469K mutant TFIIIC supported a 2-fold lower level of transcription than did wild-type TFIIIC (Fig. 3, compare lanes 2–4 to 5–7). The previously documented interaction between the TPR6 –9 array and Brf1 (23Moir R.D. Puglia K.V. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) suggested that the L469K mutation likely affected the interaction between Tfc4 and Brf1 and generated a defect in the assembly of TFIIIB complexes."

TNF-R1 activates both caspase-mediated apoptosis and NF-κB transcription of anti-apoptotic factors. We now report a link between the TNF-R1 and inositol phosphate signaling pathways. We observed that overexpression of inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase (5/6-kinase) inhibited apoptosis induced by TNFα. The anti-apoptotic effect by 5/6-kinase is not attributable to NF-κB activation, as no changes were detected in the levels of NF-κB DNA binding, IκBα degradation, or anti-apoptotic factors, such as x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein. Decreased expression of 5/6-kinase by RNA interference rendered HeLa cells more susceptible to TNFα-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of 5/6-kinase in human embryonic kidney 293 cells inhibited TNFα-induced activation of caspases-8, -3, and -9, BID, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. However, 5/6-kinase did not protect against Fas-, etoposide-, or cycloheximide-induced apoptosis. Further, 5/6-kinase protected against apoptosis induced by the overexpression of TNF-R1-associated death domain but not Fas-associated death domain. Therefore, we suggest that 5/6-kinase modifies TNFα-induced apoptosis by interfering with the activation of TNF-R1-associated death domain.

Inositol phosphate signaling is involved in many different cellular processes, ranging from intracellular calcium regulation to mRNA export from the nucleus (for review see Refs. 1Majerus P.W.

Initially purified from calf brain, 5/6-kinase was identified by its inositol phosphate kinase activity. Using inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate as a substrate, 5/6-kinase generates two different products, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate. The latter product is then further phosphorylated to produce inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate and inositol hexakisphosphate (4Verbsky J.W. Wilson M.P. Kisseleva M.V. Majerus P.W. Wente S.R. J.

To elucidate the physiological consequence of 5/6-kinase-mediated IκBα phosphorylation, we examined TNFα signaling in vivo.TNFα, a member of a large class of cytokines, elicits a wide spectrum of cellular responses including differentiation, proliferation, inflammation, and cell death. TNFα signaling simultaneously triggers apoptotic and anti-apoptotic pathways (for review see Ref. 14Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2433) Google Scholar). Although caspase activation results in apoptosis, NF-κB mediates transcription of anti-apoptotic factors that can block the caspase cascade; integration of these events determines the cellular response to TNFα stimulation.Upon TNFα binding to TNF-R1, interaction of the receptor with the TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD), a central adaptor protein for TNF-R1, leads to the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) (15Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). TNFα stimulates both the mitochondrial-dependent (intrinsic) and -independent (extrinsic) apoptotic pathways. In response to extracellular stimuli, the extrinsic pathway of TNFα signaling induces the TRADD-dependent recruitment of Fas-associated death domain (FADD), which recruits and activates procaspase-8 leading to activation of the caspase cascade (16Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2148) Google Scholar). Caspase-8 also stimulates the intrinsic pathway through the cleavage and activation of BID, resulting in cytochrome c release from mitochondria (17Kuida K. Haydar T.F. Kuan C.Y. Gu Y. Taya C.

Penninger J.M. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar).Binding of TRADD to TNF-R1 is also crucial for anti-apoptotic signaling events. Receptor-interacting protein and TNF receptor-associated factor-2 are recruited to the receptor, and this complex activates the IκB-kinase (IKK) signalosome, which phosphorylates IκBα (for review see Refs. 19Rothwarf D.M. Karin M. Science's STKE. 1999; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/sull/oc_sigtrans;1999/5/re1)PubMed Google Scholar and 20Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: 81-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3272) Google Scholar). In resting cells, IκBα inhibits NF-κB by preventing translocation of NF-κB subunits into the nucleus. However, upon TNFα stimulation, phosphorylation of IκBα by the IKK signalosome, and subsequent ubiquitination, causes its degradation by the 26 S proteasome. As a result, NF-κB translocates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of many anti-apoptotic factors, such as inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1, x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and Bcl family members, which can inhibit the TNFα-induced apoptotic pathway (21Wang C.Y.

We show that 5/6-kinase inhibits TNFα-induced apoptosis. In 5/6-kinase-overexpressing HEK 293 cells, activation of PARP, BID, caspases-8, -3, and -9 are inhibited in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Surprisingly, the protective effect of 5/6-kinase is not because of enhanced NF-κB activation. In addition, 5/6-kinase does not protect against Fas-, etoposide-, or cycloheximide-induced cell death. Therefore, we conclude that 5/6-kinase inhibits apoptosis by blocking the TNFα-induced activation of the caspase cascade.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—All chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma, unless otherwise specified.

The antibody was affinity purified on a peptide affinity column and eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, then neutralized with 1 m Tris, pH 8.0.Cell Lines—293T-Rex cells (Clontech) stably expressing 5/6-kinase or pcDNA4.0 vector-transfected cells were described previously (9Wilson M.P. Sun Y. Cao L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40998-41004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Tetracycline (0.1 μg/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) was added to cells 48 h prior to treatments.Apoptosis Assays—Trypan blue staining and APOPercentage Apoptosis Assay (Biocolor, Belfast, Northern Ireland) were used to measure the effect of 5/6-kinase overexpression on apoptosis. For APOPercentage assay, HEK 293 cells (2 × 104 cells) stably transfected with expression plasmids encoding either 5/6-kinase or vector alone were plated into 24-well plates. After 48 h of tetracycline induction (0.1 μg/ml), cell death was induced with either TNFα/CHX (1 ng/ml and 0.5 μg/ml, respectively) or CHX (0.5 μg/ml) alone in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Apoptotic cells were analyzed using APOPercentage Apoptosis Assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. For trypan blue staining, HEK 293 cells overexpressing 5/6-kinase or vector control cells were plated in triplicate in 48-well plates, and protein expression was induced with tetracycline for 48 h. After treatment with either TNFα/CHX (1 ng/ml and 0.5 μg/ml, respectively) or CHX (0.5 μg/ml) alone, cells were trypsinized and counted with a hemocytometer. An average of three independent counts for each sample point was performed.Apoptosis Induction and Detection—HEK 293 cells overexpressing either 5/6-kinase or vector control cells were plated in 12-well plates (5 × 105 cells/well) and induced with tetracycline (0.1 μg/ml) for 48 h. Apoptosis was induced by the addition of TNFα/CHX (1 ng/ml and 0.5 μg/ml, respectively), CHX (0.5 μg/ml), anti-Fas antibody/protein G (10 μg/ml and 2.5 mg/ml, respectively), or etoposide (25 μm) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After incubation for various times, cells were harvested and washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.6, and lysed in buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 μm microcystin (Sigma), and Complete™ protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science)). Total lysates were prepared by one freeze-thaw cycle on dry ice followed by brief sonication (3 × 10 s). The insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation at 15,800 × g, and protein in the supernatant was measured with a Bio-Rad assay. Equal amounts of protein were then separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. Data from multiple experiments were compared by densitometry of Western blots using an Eastman Kodak Co. Image Station 440 CF, and the data were analyzed using Kodak 1D V.3.5.4 (Scientific Imaging System). The averages ± S.D. are compared for statistical significance using a student t test.Northern Blot Analysis—For Northern analysis, total RNA extracts were prepared from HEK 293 cells (1 × 108) using RNeasy Mini kits (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Agarose gel (1% w/v) was prepared with 0.6 m formaldehyde in 1× MOPS buffer (40 mm MOPS, 10 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2). Ten μg of total RNA was denatured in loading buffer (18.5% formaldehyde, 50% formamide, 4% Ficoll400, and bromphenol blue in 1× MOPS buffer) at 55 °C for 15 min. Samples were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis at 50 mA for 3.5 h and transferred to GeneScreen Plus™ hybridization transfer membrane (Nylon; DuPont) overnight at room temperature. Upon completion of the transfer, membranes were cross-linked using Stratalinker (auto cross-link setting, 254 nm; Stratagene). Hybridization was performed using ExpressHyb™ hybridization solution (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions.DNA probes for IκBα were generated from pEGFP-IκBα-FH (XhoI/SacI digest) (kindly provided by Dr. Yunfeng Feng) and labeled in the presence of 100 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol; ICN Pharmaceuticals) using Rediprime II random prime labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). 5/6-Kinase probes were prepared from pBAKPAK-5/6-kinase (EcoRI/SmaI). Probes for NF-κB2 and RelA were kindly provided by Arthur Young. β-Actin probes (Clontech) were used as a loading control.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—NF-κB/c-Rel binding oligonucleotides (NF-κB-GS1, TTTAGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC; NF-κB-GS2, TTTGCCTGGGAAAGTCCCCTCAACT) were annealed overnight, purified by polyacrylamide gel (12%) electrophoresis, and labeled with 10 μCi of [32P]dATP (ICN Pharmaceuticals) in the presence of 10 units of Klenow DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.To prepare nuclear extracts, cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.6, and lysed in hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 15 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete™ protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)). Cells were broken by 20 passages through a 23-gauge needle, and the nuclear fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min. To ensure complete lysis of cells, nuclear fractions were washed again in hypotonic buffer and examined by light microscopy to confirm lysis. Nuclear extracts were prepared in high salt extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and Complete™ protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)) and passed through QiaThredders (Qiagen) at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad assay. For EMSA, 4–8 μg of nuclear protein was incubated in the presence of 0.2 ng of NF-κB probe (10,000 cpm), 0.3 μg of bovine serum albumin, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA in binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmEDTA) for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were applied to polyacrylamide gel (6%) in TGE buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 400 mmglycine, and 2 mm EDTA) and electrophoresed at 8 mA for 2 h, dried, and subjected to autoradiography.RESULTS5/6-Kinase Overexpression Protects against TNFα-induced Apoptosis—Previously, we reported that 5/6-kinase phosphorylated IκBα in vitro (10Sun Y. Wilson M.P. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45759-45764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). IκBα is a key regulator of the NF-κB response to TNFα stimulation (for review see Ref. 19Rothwarf D.M. Karin M. Science's STKE. 1999; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/sull/oc_sigtrans;1999/5/re1)PubMed Google Scholar); therefore we examined the effect of 5/6-kinase overexpression on TNFα signaling. TNFα can induce activation of NF-κB and transcription of target genes that feed back to protect against TNFα-induced cell death. However, if the NF-κB pathway is blocked, cells become susceptible to TNFα-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of 5/6-kinase protected cells against TNFα-induced cell death, as shown by APOPercentage staining (Fig. 1A). Treatment with TNFα alone (without CHX) did not increase cell death in either 5/6-kinase-overexpressing or vector control cells (data not shown). The anti-apoptotic effect of 5/6-kinase was further analyzed using trypan blue staining of cells treated with either TNFα/CHX or CHX alone. Although 80% of vector-transfected cells died within 20 h of TNFα/CHX stimulation, cells expressing 5/6-kinase exhibited 50% cell death. Treatment by CHX alone caused only 20% cell death in either vector or 5/6-kinase-expressing cells (Fig. 1B). Similar results were observed in HeLa cells transiently transfected with an expression plasmid containing 5/6-kinase (data not shown). These results indicate that overexpression of 5/6-kinase inhibits TNFα-induced apoptosis.5/6-kinase Does Not Enhance NF-κB Activation as a Mechanism for Protection—Signaling triggered by TNF-R1 can also cause activation of NF-κB signaling that leads to the expression of anti-apoptotic genes. To determine whether 5/6-kinase mediates its anti-apoptotic effect(s) by inhibiting the TNFα-induced apoptotic pathway and/or by promoting the TNFα-induced anti-apoptotic pathway, the stability of IκBα was measured after TNFα stimulation. Both vector control cells and 5/6-kinase-expressing cells showed IκBα degradation within 10 min (Fig. 2A). Although IκBα stability in response to TNFα signaling is not increased with the overexpression of 5/6-kinase, this does not directly show whether NF-κB activity is modulated in response to 5/6-kinase and TNFα. To determine whether 5/6-kinase directly affects NF-κB activity, the DNA binding activity of NF-κB was measured by EMSA as described under “Materials and Methods.” Treatment with TNFα for 30 min resulted in similar DNA binding activity of NF-κB in both vector control cells and 5/6-kinase-expressing cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, no significant differences were detected upon supershifting with an anti-p50 (NF-κB) antibody in 5/6-kinase or vector-expressing cells. Therefore, the ability of NF-κB to bind DNA does not seem to be increased by 5/6-kinase in response to TNFα.Fig. 2Effects of 5/6-kinase overexpression on NF-κB activation. A, HEK 293 cells stably transfected with expression plasmids of vector or 5/6-kinase were treated with TNFα (1 ng/ml) for the indicated times. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-IκBα antibody. B, HEK 293 cells overexpressing 5/6-kinase or vector control cells were stimulated with TNFα (1 ng/ml) for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared, and EMSA was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” C, HEK 293 cells overexpressing 5/6-kinase or vector control cells were treated with TNFα for 6 h, and total mRNA extracts were prepared. Northern blot analysis was performed using 32P-labeled probes for IκBα, NF-κB2, RelA, 5/6-kinase, and actin. D, HEK 293 cells overexpressing 5/6-kinase or vector control cells were stimulated with TNFα/CHX (1 ng/ml and 0.5 μg/ml, respectively) for the indicated times. Total lysate (20 μg) was applied to SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis was performed using antibodies against XIAP. The results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that TNFα-induced NF-κB activity is not affected by 5/6-kinase, the expression of NF-κB anti-apoptotic target genes were measured in mRNA extracts from 5/6-kinase- or vector-transfected cells treated with TNFα for 6 h. As shown in Fig. 2C, in the absence of TNFα, mRNA levels of IκBα and NF-κB2 are low, and RelA is undetectable. After TNFα treatment, IκBα, RelA, and NF-κB2 mRNA levels increase significantly and to similar levels in both vector control cells and 5/6-kinase-overexpressing cells. The mRNA levels of β-actin and 5/6-kinase are shown as controls. Activation of NF-κB increases the synthesis of many anti-apoptotic proteins, such as inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 and XIAP (21Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). However, the levels of XIAP are unchanged in cells expressing 5/6-kinase treated with TNFα/CHX (Fig. 2D). The mRNA levels of other NF-κB targets genes including TNF receptor-associated factor-2 and TNF receptor-associated factor-6 and Bcl family members, such as Bax, Bcl-2, and Bim were also not changed by the overexpression of 5/6-kinase (data not shown). Consistent with the lack of NF-κB up-regulation in response to 5/6-kinase overexpression, we have observed that 5/6-kinase continues to exert a protective effect against TNFα-induced apoptosis in the presence of inhibitors of NF-κB pathway, such as MG132, BAF (28Deshmukh M. Vasilakos J. Deckwerth T.L. Lampe P.A. Shivers B.D. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1341-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and BAY 11–7082 (data not shown). Therefore, these results argue that 5/6-kinase protects against TNFα-induced apoptosis through inhibition of the protease pathway and not through enhanced NF-κB activation and expression of anti-apoptotic genes.5/6-Kinase RNA Interference Renders HeLa Cells More Susceptible to TNFα-induced Cell Death—To further confirm the protective effect(s) of 5/6-kinase against TNFα-induced apoptosis, endogenous levels of 5/6-kinase were reduced using RNA interference (RNAi). HeLa cells stably transfected with an RNA interference plasmid for 5/6-kinase (5/6-kinase RNAi) or a control vector (pSuper) were treated with TNFα/CHX. Two stable cell lines (KD1 and KD2) were isolated that exhibit marked decreases in 5/6-kinase expression as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3A). The activity of 5/6-kinase was reduced by 90–95% in these cell lines (Fig. 3B). To determine the effect of decreased 5/6-kinase expression on TNFα-induced apoptosis, 5/6-kinase RNAi cells (KD1) and control cells were treated with TNFα/CHX. As shown in Fig. 3C, the control cells exhibited proteolysis of apoptotic substrate PARP within 4 h of TNFα treatment but not of BID. In comparison, 5/6-kinase RNAi cells demonstrated decreased levels of full-length BID and increased levels of cleaved PARP in response to TNFα. Similar results were obtained using the KD2 cell line. We also showed that RNAi of 5/6-kinase increased apoptosis as measured by APOPrecentage stain and trypan blue exclusion as shown (Fig. 3, D and E). These results support the hypothesis that 5/6-kinase affects TNFα-induced cell death as the 5/6-kinase RNAi cells are more susceptible to TNFα-induced apoptosis.Fig. 3Effects of 5/6-kinase RNA interference on TNFα-induced apoptosis. A, HeLa RNAi cells from two clones of either vector (pSuper) or 5/6-kinase were analyzed by Western blotting analysis for 5/6-kinase expression with β"

We report here that, in PC12 cells, cellugyrin is localized in synaptic-like microvesicles (SLMVs), along with synaptogyrin and synaptophysin. Upon overexpression of synaptophysin in PC12 cells, it is localized in rapidly sedimenting membranes and practically is not delivered to the SLMVs. On the contrary, the efficiency of the SLMV targeting of exogenously expressed cellugyrin and synaptogyrin is high. Moreover, expression of cellugyrin (or synaptogyrin) in PC12 cells dramatically and specifically increases SLMV targeting of endogenous synaptophysin. Finally, we utilized the SLMV purification scheme on a series of non-neuroendocrine cell types including the mouse fibroblast cell line 3T3-L1, the Chinese hamster ovary cell line CHO-K1, and the monkey kidney epithelial cell line COS7 and found that a cellugyrin-positive microvesicular compartment was present in all cell types tested. We suggest that synaptic vesicles have evolved from cellugyrin-positive ubiquitous microvesicles and that neuroendocrine SLMVs represent a step along that pathway of evolution.

Elucidating the mechanisms that determine the localization of proteins in specific sub-cellular compartments is critical to understanding how the cell organizes functionally distinct organelles. Because of their small size (∼50 nm), synaptic vesicles (SVs) 1The abbreviations used are: SVsynaptic vesicleSLMVsynaptic-like microvesicleCHOChinese hamster ovaryGFPgreen fluorescent proteinDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPBSphosphate-buffered salinePNSpostnuclear supernatantS2second supernatantPVDFpolyvinylidene difluoride.1The abbreviations used are: SVsynaptic vesicleSLMVsynaptic-like microvesicleCHOChinese hamster ovaryGFPgreen fluorescent proteinDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPBSphosphate-buffered salinePNSpostnuclear supernatantS2second supernatantPVDFpolyvinylidene difluoride. and their neuroendocrine counterpart, synaptic-like microvesicles (SLMVs), present an opportunity for studying a compartment with a relatively small number of proteins (1Fernandez-Chacon R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 753-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The neuroendocrine cell line, PC12, has been shown to generate SLMVs that are similar to SVs in size, density, and many marker proteins (2Navone F. Jahn R. Di Gioia G. Stukenbrok H. Greengard P.

Using this cell type, targeting signals have been identified in the amino acid sequence of the synaptic vesicle proteins VAMPII/synaptobrevin (6Grote E. Hao J.C. Bennet M.K. Kelly R.B.

In addition to the work done with PC12 cells, several groups have studied the sub-cellular localization of synaptic vesicle proteins exogenously expressed in non-neuroendocrine cell lines. Transfection of cDNA encoding the four-transmembrane protein, synaptophysin, into CHO cells leads to the expression of intact protein. However, whether synaptophysin is segregated away from early endosomal markers in a microvesicular compartment, as is the case in PC12 cells, has been the subject of much debate. Several groups have presented data that indicate that synaptophysin is co-localized in endosomes with the transferrin and low density lipoprotein receptors, both of which are excluded from PC12 SLMV (4Cameron P.L.

Targeting of ectopically expressed synaptophysin to microvesicles has been demonstrated in other non-neuronal cell types, including human breast (MCF-7) and liver (PLC) carcinoma cell lines, as well as rat smooth muscle (RVF-SMC) and bovine mammary gland cell lines (11Leube R.E.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have shown that overexpressed pantophysin, a non-neuronal paralog of synaptophysin, was localized to microvesicles in PLC cells. These latter studies contain strong electron microscopic evidence suggesting the presence of a microvesicular compartment in non-neuronal cells. However, definitive biochemical studies using an endogenous marker for this compartment have so far been lacking. Synaptophysin and pantophysin belong to the family of tetraspan vesicle membrane proteins. In addition to the physins, this family includes the gyrins and the secretory carrier-associated membrane proteins (14Hubner K. Windoffer R. Hutter H. Leube R.E. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 214: 103-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cellugyrin/synaptogyrin 2 is a non-neuronal four-transmembrane paralog of the synaptic vesicle protein, synaptogyrin 1 (15Janz R.

Synaptogyrin 1 has been shown to participate in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis and synaptic plasticity (17Janz R. Sudhof T.C. Hammer R.E. Unni V. Siegelbaum S.A. Bolshakov V.Y.

Despite these findings it is generally agreed that a function for the large family of tetraspan vesicle membrane proteins has yet to be elucidated (14Hubner K. Windoffer R. Hutter H. Leube R.E. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 214: 103-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Previously, our laboratory has shown that cellugyrin participates in the trafficking of the insulin responsive glucose transporter (Glut4) in adipose cells (19Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36263-36268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Specifically, cellugyrin populates those vesicles shuttling Glut4 between sorting and recycling endosomes but is excluded from the larger Glut4 vesicles that translocate to the plasma membrane in response to insulin (20Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror V. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9133-9138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cellugyrin-positive vesicles are present in nonhomogenized adipocytes and are formed in vitro in a cytosol-, ATP-, and time-dependent manner, suggesting that these vesicles are not a product of homogenization (21Xu Z. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47972-47975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined the sub-cellular localization of cellugyrin in diverse cell types. We show that cellugyrin is a marker of ubiquitous microvesicles present in all species tested indistinguishable based on velocity sedimentation properties from the SLMVs in PC12 cells. Furthermore, initiation of these studies led to the observation that cellugyrin, and its neuronal paralog, synaptogyrin, enhances the efficiency of synaptophysin targeting to SLMVs in PC12 cells in a robust and specific fashion. At the same time, ectopically expressed synaptophysin did not alter targeting of cellugyrin to SLMVs. These findings may shed light on the mechanism of SV biogenesis from a ubiquitous vesicular carrier. We suggest that the production of microvesicles is an evolutionarily ancient mechanism that is co-opted by neurons for the production of synaptic vesicles. Thus, microvesicle targeting of exogenously expressed synaptic vesicle proteins in non-neuronal systems represents an interaction between the neuronal paralog and the ubiquitous system of sorting such proteins. According to this model cellugyrin, and probably other tetraspan vesicle membrane proteins, may provide a core set of component proteins required for a minimal vesicle that can serve as a matrix for assembly of specialized vesicular carriers in differentiated cells.

Cell Culture—PC12 cells, a pheochromocytoma cell line, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 40 μg/ml proline, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Monkey kidney cells (COS7) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Mouse fibroblasts (3T3-L1) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 10% CO2 at 37 °C. Isolation and Fractionation Procedures—Confluent 15- or 10-cm plates were rinsed once with PBS. Cells were lifted with cell dissociation media (Sigma) for PC12 cells, trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen) for COS7 and CHO-K1 cells, or by scraping for 3T3-L1 cells. Cells were then pelleted at 400 × g for 7 min. Cells were resuspended in Buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm MgCl2) with protease inhibitors (1 μm aprotinin, 5 μm benzamidine, 2 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Resuspended cells were homogenized with 11 strokes through a ball bearing cell cracker (European Molecular Biology Laboratory) and centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min to generate a postnuclear supernatant (PNS). A second supernatant (S2) that contains only microvesicles was generated by centrifugation of the PNS at 27,000 × g (15,000 rpm) for 35 min in a Ti42.2 rotor (Beckman) (5Clift-O'Grady L. Linstedt A.D. Lowe A.W. Grote E. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Velocity gradient fractionation was performed by layering 500–1000 μg of PNS or S2 onto one of two types of gradients; the majority of experiments were performed using 4.6 ml of 10–25% glycerol in Buffer A (v/v) gradients centrifuged for 55 min. Also used was a 4.2-ml 5–25% glycerol in Buffer A (v/v) gradient with a 400-μl 50% sucrose in Buffer A (w/v) pad centrifuged for 1 h (5Clift-O'Grady L. Linstedt A.D. Lowe A.W. Grote E. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). All velocity gradients were centrifuged in an SW55 rotor (Beckman) at 280,000 × g (48,000 rpm). Fractionation was from the bottom via a peristaltic pump. Density gradient fractionation was performed by layering 500–1000 μg of S2 onto a 4.6-ml 10–50% sucrose in Buffer A (w/v) gradient. These gradients were centrifuged at 280,000 × g (48,000 rpm) in an SW55 rotor (Beckman) for 16 h. Fractionation was from the bottom via a peristaltic pump. Vesicle decoration/shift analysis was performed by incubating 1 mg of S2 with 2.5 μg of purified nonspecific mouse IgG, anti-cellugyrin monoclonal, or anti-synaptophysin monoclonal antibodies, together with 2 μg of nanogold conjugated goat anti-mouse Fab fragments (Nanoprobes). The mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. The total volume of decorated vesicles was then loaded on 4.6-ml linear 10–30% sucrose in Buffer A (w/v). Gradients were centrifuged at 280,000 × g (48,000 rpm) in an SW55 rotor (Beckman) for 1 h 15 min. Fractionation was from the bottom via a peristaltic pump. Immunofluorescence—PC12 cells transfected with pBJ1-Cg-GFP were lifted and grown on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine over night. Next, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, then washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, blocked with 4% donkey serum, and stained with monoclonal anti-synaptophysin or anti-synaptogyrin antibodies followed by Rhodamine RedX-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Each incubation with antibody lasted for 60 min at room temperature and was followed by six quick rinses with PBS. A SlowFade-Light Antifade kit (Molecular Probes) was used for mounting cells on slides. Staining was examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM510; Carl Zeiss Inc.). Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) and transferred to a PVDF membrane in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine. Following transfer, the membrane was blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk in PBS for 1 h at 25 °C and probed with specific antibodies overnight. The membranes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After three more washes the membranes were incubated in ECL reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 min and then exposed to an Eastman Kodak Co. 440 image station. Data analysis was performed with Kodak 1D image analysis software. Statistical Analysis—The student's unpaired two-tailed t test was used to evaluate the statistical significance of the differences in targeting efficiencies. Targeting efficiency is defined as the amount of a specific protein in the S2 fraction normalized by the total amount of the same protein in the PNS. Cellugyrin Is Localized in Synaptic-like Microvesicles in PC12 Cells—We have examined cellugyrin compartmentalization in PC12 cells. After homogenization, a PNS was obtained by centrifugation for 5 min at 300 × g. Separation of the PNS on two different types of glycerol velocity gradient followed by Western blot analysis of gradient fractions revealed a peak of synaptic-like microvesicles marked by synaptophysin and synaptogyrin in fractions 7–13 (Fig. 1, A and B) (4Cameron P.L. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. DeCamilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 5Clift-O'Grady L. Linstedt A.D. Lowe A.W. Grote E. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Probing of these membranes with anti-cellugyrin antibodies showed that cellugyrin co-localizes with the synaptic vesicle markers in this gradient. In addition, exogenously expressed mouse cellugyrin with a C-terminal green fluorescent protein tag (mouse cellugyrin-GFP) co-localized with the synaptic vesicle markers. It is important to note that the peak of small vesicles is clearly distinct from the endosomal marker the transferrin receptor and the insulin responsive amino peptidase, the latter having been characterized as a marker of a larger vesicular carrier (23Thoidis G. Kandror K.V. Traffic. 2001; 2: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the following experiments, PC12 SLMVs were separated from heavier membrane compartments recovered at the bottom of the glycerol velocity gradient (Fig. 1A) by centrifugation for 35 min at 27,000 × g as described previously (4Cameron P.L. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. DeCamilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 5Clift-O'Grady L. Linstedt A.D. Lowe A.W. Grote E. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This high speed supernatant (S2) was layered onto a 10–50% sucrose density gradient, and the gradient fractions were analyzed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2). Again, cellugyrin co-localized with synaptic vesicle markers (SV2, synaptophysin, and synaptobrevin) in the SLMV. Immunoadsorptions of intact vesicles from S2 were carried out to determine whether cellugyrin is localized in the same compartment with synaptic vesicle markers (Fig. 3). S2 was incubated with magnetic beads coated with monoclonal antibodies and the postabsorptive supernatants and SDS elutions were subjected to Western blot analysis. Immunoadsorption with cellugyrin antibodies precipitated all of the synaptophysin, synaptogyrin, and VAMPII signal from S2. Furthermore, immunoadsorption with synaptophysin antibodies precipitated the entire endogenous cellugyrin signal from S2. Control immunoadsorption with nonspecific mouse IgG did not precipitate any of the cellugyrin or synaptic vesicle markers signals from S2. Thus immunoadsorption experiments confirm the results from velocity and density gradient fractionation and directly suggest co-localization of cellugyrin and synaptic vesicle markers in small vesicles. Despite the results obtained from immunoadsorption, it is still possible that different vesicular compartments exist in PC12 cells. For example, two putative vesicular populations may have similar velocity and density gradient characteristics but contain different sets of component proteins. If one imagined the protein content of hypothetical vesicle A to be composed of 99% synaptophysin and 1% cellugyrin and the protein content of hypothetical vesicle B to be composed of 99% cellugyrin and 1% synaptophysin, then these populations would remain indistinguishable by immunoadsorption, because both vesicle populations do contain both proteins and would likely be precipitated by either antibody. To determine the presence of different vesicle populations, we turned to a method known as vesicle decoration/shift analysis (20Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror V. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9133-9138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, vesicles were decorated by a monoclonal antibody against a cytoplasmic epitope of one of the vesicle proteins. Additional mass is added to the monoclonal antibody by the co-incubation of nanogold conjugated anti-mouse Fab fragments. The decorated vesicles were layered onto a 10–30% sucrose velocity gradient, and the gradient fractions were analyzed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4). In Fig. 4A, the baseline sedimentation of this vesicular population is determined after incubation with nonspecific IgG. In Fig. 4B, decoration with anti-cellugyrin antibody has resulted in a shift of the peak of vesicular markers by four fractions toward the bottom of the gradient. Most significantly the alignment of cellugyrin with the rest of synaptic vesicle markers is maintained. In Fig. 4C, decoration with anti-synaptophysin antibody has resulted in a shift of the peak of vesicular markers by eight fractions toward the bottom of the gradient suggesting that synaptophysin is more abundant in the SLMVs than cellugyrin. In this case, the peak of cellugyrin also co-localizes with the synaptic vesicle markers. Results of this experiment directly demonstrate that synaptophysin and cellugyrin are present, although in different amounts, in a single type of vesicle population. Immunofluorescence staining of PC12 cells was used as an independent method for examining the sub-cellular distribution of cellugyrin and synaptophysin (Fig. 5). PC12 cells transfected with mouse cellugyrin-GFP were fixed, permeabilized, and probed with rat-specific anti-cellugyrin antibody. This showed co-localization of the endogenous (rat) and the exogenous (mouse) proteins (data not shown). Next, we probed similarly transfected cells with antibodies against synaptophysin and synaptogyrin. The staining in Fig. 4 shows that transfected cellugyrin co-localizes with these synaptic markers in PC12 cells. Cellugyrin and Synaptogyrin Specifically Increase the Targeting Efficiency of Synaptophysin to SLMV—To examine the contribution of cellugyrin to the biogenesis of microvesicles, we decided to test the effects of increased cellugyrin expression. Varying doses of either His- or Myc/His-tagged cellugyrin were transfected into PC12 cells, followed by isolation of PNS and S2, which were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (Fig. 6, A and B). Based on Figs. 1 and 2, as well as previously published reports, the expression level of the construct in the PNS was taken as a measure of total exogenous protein, whereas the expression level in S2 was taken as a measure of protein in microvesicles (6Grote E. Hao J.C. Bennet M.K. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Note that PNS and S2 differ only very slightly (5–10%) in protein concentration, and thus loading equal protein in these experiments is tantamount to loading equal starting material. This experiment led to the discovery that transfection of cellugyrin leads to a dose-dependent increase of synaptophysin in the microvesicle fraction (S2) (p < 0.0005) without changing its total expression level. To ensure that the increased synaptophysin levels found in S2 were in fact in SLMV, we subjected S2 fractions from empty vector and His-cellugyrin-transfected cells to glycerol gradient centrifugation (Fig. 7). This experiment revealed that the increased levels of synaptophysin seen in the S2 fraction of cellugyrin cells are in a vesicular compartment with the same sedimentation characteristics as SLMV. Next, we compared the levels of synaptophysin in S2 from cells transfected with His-cellugyrin or His-synaptophysin (Fig. 8, top panel). The transfection efficiency of His-synaptophysin and His-cellugyrin was similar as their signals in the PNS are equivalent. In agreement with data shown in Figs. 6 and 7, we found that transfection of cellugyrin dramatically increases the amount of endogenous synaptophysin in S2, whereas transfection of synaptophysin does not dramatically change the level of cellugyrin in this fraction. A high level of expression of His-synaptophysin only leads to a moderate increase of this protein in S2, so that the total synaptophysin signal in S2 was much lower than in cells transfected with His-cellugyrin. In other words, synaptophysin SLMV targeting efficiency is increased more by cellugyrin expression than by expression of synaptophysin itself. This is consistent with data that show that the majority of synaptophysin in non-transfected PC12 cells is located in compartments that are larger than the SLMV (Fig. 1, A and B) and may represent donor membranes from which SLMVs originate (24Desnos C. Clift-O'Grady L. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1041-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25Faundez V. Horng J.T. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 26Shi G. Faundez V. Roos J. Dell'Angelica E.C. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Next we wanted to know whether the effect of cellugyrin on synaptophysin is a general function of the gyrin class of proteins or if it is specific to cellugyrin. To test this, rat synaptogyrin was transfected into PC12 cells after which PNS and S2 were subjected to Western blot analysis (Fig. 9). This figure demonstrates that increased targeting efficiency of synaptophysin is equally inducible by cellugyrin or synaptogyrin. We suggest, therefore, that targeting of synaptophysin to SLMV requires the presence of cellugyrin or synaptogyrin that radically increases the efficiency of synaptophysin targeting into SLMV. Cellugyrin Is Present in a Synaptic Vesicle-sized Compartment in All Cell Types Tested—Because cellugyrin is expressed in all tissues (15Janz R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2851-2857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we explored the compartmentalization of cellugyrin in diverse cell types (Fig. 10). Sub-cellular fractionation was performed on the mouse fibroblast cell line 3T3-L1, the Chinese hamster ovary cell line CHO-K1, and the monkey kidney epithelial cell line COS7. A high speed supernatant (S2) from each cell type, prepared in the same way as for PC12 cells, was separated in a 10–25% glycerol gradient. Fractions from these gradients were subjected to Western blot analysis. A clear cellugyrin peak is present in the same location as the SLMV of PC12. Furthermore, His-cellugyrin transfected into COS7 cells also sedimented to the same location on the glycerol gradient. Together, these data suggest that cellugyrin is present in microvesicles in all cell types. Synaptic vesicles were once considered to be the smallest type of vesicular carrier and an adaptation unique to the nervous system. However, Johnston et al. (8Johnston P.A. Cameron P.L. Stukenbrok H. Jahn R. De Camilli P. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2863-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) reported that exogenously expressed synaptophysin targets to microvesicles in CHO cells. The fact that a non-neuronal cell type was capable of sorting a synaptic vesicle protein to a sub-cellular compartment similar in size to synaptic vesicles suggested that synaptic vesicles evolved from this ubiquitous microvesicle (8Johnston P.A. Cameron P.L. Stukenbrok H. Jahn R. De Camilli P. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2863-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Subsequently, studies using the electron microscope have identified pantophysin, a non-neuronal paralog of synaptophysin, as a marker of ubiquitous microvesicles of similar size (<90 nm) (13Haass N.K. Kartenbeck M.A. Leube R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, ubiquitous microvesicles have never been isolated and characterized biochemically using a non-overexpressed endogenous marker protein. Moreover, it is not clear if these vesicles are present in non-transfected cells or represent an artifact of protein overexpression. The data presented in this paper provide the first biochemical evidence for the existence of a ubiquitous microvesicle compartment using cellugyrin as an endogenous marker protein. Furthermore, the suggested evolutionary relationship between ubiquitous microvesicles and synaptic vesicles (8Johnston P.A. Cameron P.L. Stukenbrok H. Jahn R. De Camilli P. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2863-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) gains weight from the observation that the expression level of cellugyrin, a non-neuronal protein, has functional effects on the synaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin. Specifically, the expression level of cellugyrin has a direct effect on the targeting efficiency of synaptophysin to SLMVs. The use of PC12 cell SLMVs as a model system for the biosynthesis of synaptic vesicles has been a matter of some controversy. On the one hand, this model has been useful for elucidating SLMV targeting sequences for synaptic vesicle proteins, such as synaptobrevin and synaptotagmin (6Grote E. Hao J.C. Bennet M.K. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 7Blagoveshchenskaya A.D. Hewitt E.W. Cutler D.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3979-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is assumed that SLMV targeting sequences in PC12 cells would correspond to synaptic vesicle targeting sequences in neurons. On the other hand, two classes of non-neuronal proteins also target to SLMVs, the first being non-neuronal paralogs of synaptic vesicle proteins, like cellubrevin/VAMPIII (6Grote E. Hao J.C. Bennet M.K. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 27Chilcote T.J. Galli T. Mundigl O. Edelmann L. McPherson P.S. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and cellugyrin as reported here. The second class of non-neuronal proteins that target to PC12 SLMVs have no neuronal counterpart. Examples of this class of protein are tyrosinase and p-selectin, which are recognized by the AP3 adaptor, part of the SLMV budding machinery (7Blagoveshchenskaya A.D. Hewitt E.W. Cutler D.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3979-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Blagoveshchenskaya A.D. Hewitt E.W. Cutler D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1419-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Blagoveshchenskaya A.D. Cutler D.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1801-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A possibility exists that the SLMVs in PC12 cells represents a mixture of real synaptic vesicles and ubiquitous microvesicles. To address this question we performed velocity and density gradient centrifugation in an attempt to identify two distinct vesicular pools based on physical characteristics. The results of these experiments indicate that if two pools exist, they are inseparable based on physical parameters (Figs. 1 and 2). Next, we used immunoadsorption to examine whether cellugyrin is co-localized in PC12 SLMVs with the synaptic vesicle marker proteins. Immunoadsorption of cellugyrin containing membranes precipitated all of the synaptic vesicle markers and immunoadsorption of synaptophysin containing membranes precipitated all of the cellugyrin (Fig. 3). Finally, vesicle decoration/shift analysis provides a method for directly determining whether there are distinguishable populations of vesicles. Co-localization of cellugyrin with the synaptic vesicle markers, synaptophysin, synaptogyrin, and synaptobrevin (Fig. 4) in these experiments strongly suggest that that there is only one pool of microvesicles in PC12 cells, namely SLMVs, that contain both neuronal and non-neuronal proteins. We then turned to examine the targeting of different proteins into this compartment. Targeting efficiency in this paper was defined as the ratio of a given protein in microvesicles (S2) to the total protein (PNS). We believe that it is more accurate to normalize data by the total amount of starting material because of reported interactions among the various proteins that might be exaggerated or alternatively bypassed by manipulation of the system (30Edelmann L. Hanson P.I. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The “targeting index” used for VAMP-TAg constructs (6Grote E. Hao J.C. Bennet M.K. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), which normalizes all VAMP-TAg values by dividing by synaptophysin content (as a measure of vesicle number), cannot be used for cellugyrin, because cellugyrin directly affects the amount of synaptophysin in small vesicles. We do not yet know whether the increase in synaptophysin represents increased copy number per vesicle or whether the transfection of cellugyrin increases the number of vesicles. Irrespectively, it is clear that the amount of cellugyrin and/or synaptogyrin in a cell can have an effect on the targeting of synaptophysin to microvesicles. This observation may shed light on the longstanding controversy regarding synaptophysin targeting in non-neuronal cells. Although some groups claim that ectopically expressed synaptophysin in CHO cells is found in larger endosomal vesicles (4Cameron P.L. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. DeCamilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 9Linstedt A.D. Kelly R.B. Neuron. 1991; 7: 309-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), others have argued that the same protein can be found in microvesicles in the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line PLC cells (11Leube R.E. Wiedenmann B. Franke W.W. Cell. 1989; 59: 433-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 12Leube R.E. Leimer U. Grund C. Franke W.W. Harth N. Wiedenmann B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1589-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We suggest that these two cell lines express different levels of cellugyrin and thus have different capacities for packaging synaptophysin into microvesicles. In other words, the high level of exogenous synaptophysin targeting to microvesicles in PLC cells may be a direct result of the high level of cellugyrin expression in hepatocytes. Finally, we examined the sub-cellular distribution of cellugyrin in a series of non-neuroendocrine cells. Using the same isolation technique used for PC12 SLMVs microvesicles from mouse fibroblasts (3T3-L1), hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1), and monkey kidney cells (COS7) were isolated. Western analysis of fractions from glycerol velocity gradient centrifugation of these diverse samples indicates that there is a microvesicular pool with the same sedimentation characteristics as PC12 SLMVs in all of these cell types with cellugyrin as a marker protein. Given that all cell types tested contain a cellugyrin-positive microvesicular compartment and that cellugyrin expression levels have a direct impact on synaptophysin targeting efficiency to PC12 cell SLMVs, we propose that cellugyrin-positive small vesicles represent an evolutionary predecessor to synaptic vesicles. One can further speculate that PC12 SLMVs represent an intermediate stage on the evolution from ubiquitous microvesicles to synaptic vesicles. From this perspective, the targeting of non-neuronal proteins to this compartment represents an ancient mechanism, whereas the targeting of neuronal proteins represents the evolutionarily more recent utilization and adaptation of those ancient mechanisms. We thank Dr. T. Südhof (University of Texas at South Western) and Dr. P. Reay (Oxford, United Kingdom) for providing critical reagents."
https://openalex.org/W1983816221,"Previous studies have identified an enhancer 3′ of the scl gene that can direct transgene expression to hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells. Here we use this enhancer to restrict expression of the avian leukosis virus receptor, TVA, to hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors in bone marrow and fetal liver and demonstrate that retroviral infection can be used to specifically introduce exogenous sequences. We show that a majority of CFU-S12 multipotential progenitor cells can be transduced in vitro. Uniquely, transduction of TVA+ progenitors with a retrovirus encoding a puromycin resistance gene allows selection and expansion of a multipotential hematopoietic progenitor population that can be superinfected with high efficiency. Using this system we show for the first time that v-Myb oncoproteins expressed from avian viruses can induce a leukemic transformation in the mouse. The phenotype of the transformed cells is similar to that which is seen in the chicken and is likewise dependent on the particular structure of v-Myb. This implies that the basic mechanisms of action of mutated transcription factors in the etiology of leukemia are conserved between birds and mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2056074790,"Glutamate receptors are not only abundant and important mediators of fast excitatory synaptic transmission in vertebrates, but they also serve a similar function in invertebrates such as Drosophila and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In C. elegans, an animal with only 302 neurons, 10 different glutamate receptor subunits have been identified and cloned. To study the ion channel properties of these receptor subunits, we recorded glutamate-gated currents from Xenopus oocytes that expressed either C. elegans glutamate receptor subunits or chimeric rat/C. elegans glutamate receptor subunits. The chimeras were constructed between the C. elegans glutamate receptor pore domains and either the rat kainate receptor subunit GluR6, the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) receptor subunit GluR1, or the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit NMDAR1-1a. Although native subunits were nonfunctional, 9 of 10 ion pores were found to conduct current upon transplantation into rat receptor subunits. A provisional classification of the C. elegans glutamate receptor subunits was attempted based on functionality of the chimeras. C. elegans glutamate receptor ion pores, at a position homologous to a highly conserved site critical for ion permeation properties in vertebrate glutamate receptor pores, contain amino acids not found in vertebrate glutamate receptors. We show that the pore-constricting Q/R site, which in vertebrate receptors determines calcium permeability and rectification properties of the ion channel, in C. elegans can be occupied by other amino acids, including, surprisingly, lysine and proline, without loss of these properties.

Glutamate serves as an important neurotransmitter mediating rapid excitatory synaptic transmission via a large and diverse number of postsynaptic ionotropic glutamate receptors in both vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems. In vertebrates, distinct receptor subunits contribute to mature heteromeric receptors, which have properties that depend on the particular combination of receptor subunits (1Hollmann M. Jonas P. Monyer H. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology: Iononotropic Glutamate Receptors in the CNS. Springer Verlag, Berlin1999: 3-98Google Scholar). Functional receptors are classified according to their response to selective agonists. Thus, glutamate receptors are grouped into two major categories: non-NMDA receptors, which include α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) 1The abbreviations used are: AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate; CaR, calcium Ringer; ConA, concanavalin A; GLR, C. elegans glutamate receptor; GluR, glutamate receptor; MgR, magnesium Ringer; NFR solution, normal frog Ringer's solution; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; NMR, C. elegans NMDA receptor; PCS, pore cassette small; TMD, transmembrane domain.1The abbreviations used are: AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate; CaR, calcium Ringer; ConA, concanavalin A; GLR, C. elegans glutamate receptor; GluR, glutamate receptor; MgR, magnesium Ringer; NFR solution, normal frog Ringer's solution; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; NMR, C. elegans NMDA receptor; PCS, pore cassette small; TMD, transmembrane domain. receptors and kainate (KA) receptors, and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (1Hollmann M.

This pharmacological classification is supported by the analysis of amino acid sequence identities of receptor subunits (1Hollmann M. Jonas P. Monyer H. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology: Iononotropic Glutamate Receptors in the CNS. Springer Verlag, Berlin1999: 3-98Google Scholar). Invertebrate nervous systems utilize multiple subtypes of glutamate receptor subunits. Analysis of the genomes of both Drosophila melanogaster (3Littleton J.T. Ganetzky B. Neuron. 2000; 26: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) and Caenorhabditis elegans (4Brockie P.J. Madsen D.M. Zheng Y. Mellem J.E. Maricq A.V. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1510-1522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by sequence similarity searches (BLAST) has revealed large families of genes comprising at least 10 genes encoding putative ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits. Three of these genes from C. elegans, glr-1 (5Hart A.C. Sims S. Kaplan J.M. Nature. 1995; 378: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 6Maricq A.V. Peckol E. Driscoll M. Bargmann C.I.

Neuron. 2002; 36: 933-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), have been characterized in detail. glr-1 and glr-2 encode subunits most similar to mammalian non-NMDA receptor subunits, whereas nmr-1 encodes a subunit most similar to mammalian NMDA receptor subunits. Glutamate-gated, kainate-gated, and NMDA-gated currents could be recorded in vivo from a defined interneuron, and mutations in receptor subunits had specific effects on glutamate-gated currents (7Brockie P.J. Mellem J.E. Hills T. Madsen D.M. Maricq A.V. Neuron. 2001; 31: 617-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 8Mellem J.E. Brockie P.J. Zheng Y. Madsen D.M. Maricq A.V. Neuron. 2002; 36: 933-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For the remaining seven receptor subunits, partial cDNAs have been cloned (4Brockie P.J. Madsen D.M. Zheng Y. Mellem J.E. Maricq A.V. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1510-1522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All vertebrate ionotropic glutamate receptors presumably have the same topology, namely three transmembrane domains (TMD) A, B, and C (also called M1, M3, and M4, respectively), a pore-forming region (P-loop, also called M2) located between TMDs A and B, an extracellular N terminus, and an intracellular C terminus (Fig. 1). The ligand binding sites are made up of two interacting domains, S1 and S2, that flank the pore-forming region (9Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.Q. Gouaux E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Short stretches of amino acids (linkers A, B, and C) connect the S1 domain to TMD A and the S2 domain to TMDs B and C (Fig. 1). On the basis of sequence conservation, the C. elegans glutamate receptor subunits appear to have the same topological organization as vertebrate receptors (4Brockie P.J. Madsen D.M. Zheng Y. Mellem J.E. Maricq A.V. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1510-1522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we show that the pore-forming domains of C. elegans glutamate receptors have conserved features and behave as functional ion permeation modules. Although the rules for receptor assembly and function are complex, the rules for pore function are more straightforward. We have cloned full-length cDNAs of the 7 remaining C. elegans glutamate receptors and expressed individual receptor subunits in Xenopus oocytes. We also constructed chimeras between three rat glutamate receptor subunits (GluR) (the kainate receptor subunit GluR6, the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1, and the NMDA receptor subunit NMDAR1-1a) and the ion pore domains of all 10 C. elegans receptor subunits. These studies demonstrated a remarkable conservation of pore function and revealed unexpected insights into determinants of ion permeation. Mutagenesis—The rat kainate receptor subunit GluR6(Q) and a non-desensitizing mutant of the rat AMPA receptor GluR1 (GluR1(L479F) (10Stern-Bach Y. Russo S. Neuman M. Rosenmund C. Neuron. 1998; 21: 907-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar)), as well as C. elegans subunits GLR1 to GLR8 and NMR1 to NMR2 (4Brockie P.J. Madsen D.M. Zheng Y. Mellem J.E. Maricq A.V. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1510-1522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were used for construction of glutamate receptor subunit chimeras. To enable transplantation of domains, identical restriction sites were introduced at homologous positions in all cDNAs by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis using mutagenic primers as described previously (11Villmann C. Strutz N. Morth T. Hollmann M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1765-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). All mutated clones were sequenced across the PCR-amplified regions. We used two introduced restriction sites at homologous positions in C. elegans, GluR6, GluR1(L479F), and NMDAR1-1a to construct chimeras between these receptors: NruI C-terminally of TMD A at amino acids 149–151 FLV (GLR1), 148–150 FLV (GLR2), 137–139 WII (GLR3), 139–141 HIL (GLR4), 145–147 YFV (GLR5), 143–145 TVA (GLR6), 139–141 WIF (GLR7), 144–146 FLV (GLR8), 186–188 YCL (NMR1), and 171–173 FLF (NMR2), respectively; furthermore, EcoRI N-terminally of TMD B at amino acids 204–206 RIA (GLR1), 202–204 RIA (GLR2), 192–194 RLL (GLR3), 198–200 RLI (GLR4), 215–217 RLL (GLR5), 186–188 TVA (GLR6), 193–195 RLV (GLR7), 188–190 RVL (GLR8), 253–255 RVL (NMR1), and 222–224 RLM (NMR2), respectively. For the C. elegans proteins, numbering is according to the amino acid sequences published in Brockie et al. (4Brockie P.J. Madsen D.M. Zheng Y. Mellem J.E. Maricq A.V. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1510-1522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length sequences are not shown here and will be published elsewhere. The construction of GluR6-PCS, GluR1-PCS, and NMDAR1-1a-PCS has been described previously (11Villmann C. Strutz N. Morth T. Hollmann M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1765-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Villmann C. Bull L. Hollmann M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7634-7643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The introduced restriction sites NruI and EcoRI engineered to flank the pore domains to be transplanted resulted in so-called “PCS” (= pore cassette small) constructs of the recipient subunits (Fig. 1). The introduction of those restriction sites in the cDNAs of wild type GluR6, GluR1(L479F), and NMDAR1 (splice variant NR1–1a) in some cases caused alterations of amino acids (see Fig. 1). The resulting constructs were named GluR6-PGLR1, GluR6-PGLR2, GluR6-PGLR3, GluR6-PGLR4, GluR6-PGLR5, GluR6-PGLR6, GluR6-PGLR7, GluR6-PGLR8, GluR6-PNMR1, GluR6-PNMR2, GluR1 (L479F)-PGLR1, GluR1(L479F)-PGLR2, GluR1(L479F)-PGLR3, GluR1(L479F)-PGLR4, GluR1(L479F)-PGLR5, GluR1(L479F)-PGLR6, GluR1(L479F)-PGLR7, GluR1(L479F)-PGLR8, GluR1(L479F)-PNMR1, GluR1(L479F)-PNMR2, and NMDAR1-PNMR1, respectively, where P stands for pore. cRNA Synthesis—cRNA synthesis was performed as described earlier (11Villmann C. Strutz N. Morth T. Hollmann M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1765-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, template DNA was linearized with a suitable restriction enzyme. cRNA was synthesized from 1 μg of linearized DNA using an in vitro transcription kit (Stratagene) with a modified protocol that employs 800 μmm7GpppG (Pharmacia) for capping and an extended reaction time of 3 h with T7 polymerase. Trace labeling was performed with [32P]UTP to allow calculation of yields and evaluation of transcript quality by agarose gel electrophoresis. Electrophysiological Measurements in Xenopus Oocytes—Oocytes of stages V–VI were surgically removed from the ovaries of Xenopus laevis as described elsewhere (13Everts I. Villmann C. Hollmann M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 861-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 10 ng of cRNA using a 10-μl Drummond (Broomall, PA) microdispenser. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed 4–8 days after cRNA injection with a TurboTec 10CD amplifier (npi, Tamm, Germany). Glutamatergic agonists (300 μm) were prepared in normal frog Ringer's solution (NFR, in mm, 115 NaCl, 1.5 CaCl2, 2.5 KCl, and 10 HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2). Current electrodes were filled with 3 m CsCl and had resistances of ≈ 0.5–1.5 megohms. Voltage electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances of ≈ 4 megohms. Oocytes were held at –70 mV, and agonists (kainate, glutamate, and AMPA) were applied by superfusion for 10 s at a flow rate of 10–14 ml/min. To minimize receptor desensitization, bath pretreatment of oocytes with concanavalin A (ConA, 10 μm for 8 min) preceded agonist application when recording from GluR6 mutants (13Everts I. Villmann C. Hollmann M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 861-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Current-voltage relationships (I/V curves) were recorded in magnesium Ringer (MgR) (in mm, 115 NaCl, 1.5 MgCl2, 2.5 KCl, and 10 HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2), employing 2-s ramps from –150 mV to +50 mV. Calcium permeability was analyzed in CaR (calcium Ringer, in mm, CaCl2, 80; HEPES-Ca(OH)2, 10, pH 7.2). All agonists were prepared in the particular Ringer solution used in the experiment: measurements in NFR had agonists prepared in NFR, measurements in MgR had agonists prepared in MgR, and measurements in CaR had agonists prepared in CaR. To exclude contributions to the maximal amplitudes of endogenous calcium-activated chloride channels triggered by calcium influx through glutamate receptors, we did a series of control experiments and preinjected oocytes with 50 nl of 200 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 20 min prior to recording agonist-activated currents. This injection achieves an estimated intracellular concentration of ∼20 mm EGTA, which assures efficient complexation of any incoming calcium before endogenous chloride channels can be activated (14Soto F. Garcia-Guzman M. Gomez-Hernandez J.M. Hollmann M. Karschin C. Stühmer W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3684-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Labeling of Cell Surface Proteins Using Biotinylated ConA—To identify the fraction of receptor protein inserted in the plasma membrane, surface proteins were tagged with biotinylated ConA and isolated by streptavidin-Sepharose-mediated precipitation of the biotinyl-ConA-protein complex. Briefly, intact oocytes were incubated in 10 μm biotinyl-ConA (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. After five 10-min washes in NFR, intact oocytes were homogenized with a Teflon pestle in H buffer (20 μl/oocyte; 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride plus a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (Complete™ tablets, Roche Applied Science)) and were kept at 4 °C for 1 h on a rotator. After centrifugation for 60 s at 16 000 × g, the supernatants were supplemented with 20 μl of washed streptavidin-Sepharose beads (Sigma) and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h on the rotator. The streptavidin-Sepharose beads were then pelleted by a 120-s spin at 1,600 × g and washed three times in H-buffer. The final pellets were boiled in 40 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer (0.8 m β-mercaptoethanol, 6% SDS, 20% glycerol, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1% bromphenol blue). Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Proteins were separated on 20-cm SDS-polyacrylamide gels (11Villmann C. Strutz N. Morth T. Hollmann M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1765-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Gels were blotted (11Villmann C. Strutz N. Morth T. Hollmann M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1765-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) onto Hybond enhanced chemoluminescence (ECL) nitrocellulose membranes (Advantec MFS, Inc.). Following an established protocol (Bio-Rad, semidry electrophoretic transfer), an affinity-purified polyclonal GLR1 antibody (dilution 1:200) directed against a 22-amino acid fragment of an extracellular domain of GLR1 (4Brockie P.J. Madsen D.M. Zheng Y. Mellem J.E. Maricq A.V. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1510-1522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used along with a goat anti-rabbit antibody (dilution 1:5,000) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase to detect GLR1. Molecular Modeling—The KcsA channel structure (15Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5649) Google Scholar) was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (1BL8). Three-dimensional structural models of the pore domains of glutamate receptors were constructed based on the crystal structure of the corresponding domains of KcsA. The glutamate receptor models GLR7 and GLR8 were generated by virtual mutagenesis of the individual residues leaving the backbone structures intact. The subunits of GluR6(Q), GluR6(R), GLR2, and GLR5 could not be modeled by direct homology to KcsA because of a deletion within the selectivity filter (see Fig. 6A, alignment). In these cases, the position and direction of the α-helical segment of the pore domain were fixed. The hydrogen bond between a nitrogen of Trp (67 in KcsA) of the pore helix and a side chain oxygen of Asp/Glu (80 in KcsA) were kept by maintaining these residues in almost identical position. This resulted in different conformations of the flexible selectivity filter in the models for GluR6(Q) and GluR6(R) compared with GLR2 and GLR5, which have a deletion in the selectivity filter. The ψ/ϕ angles of these selectivity filters were adapted to favorable positions using Swiss PDB Viewer 3.7 (b2) (16Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9398) Google Scholar). A 4-fold symmetry was then built, and the individual subunits were moved ≈ 0.2 nm away from the central axis of the selectivity filter to increase the pore diameter to around 0.75–8 nm (the largest ion conducted by AMPA receptors is 0.75 nm in diameter (17Burnashev N. Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B. Neuron. 1992; 8: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar)). All models were energy-optimized (Gromos96). Manipulations were performed using Swiss PDB Viewer 3.7 (b2) (16Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9398) Google Scholar). The set of assumptions of an increased pore diameter, a maintained pore helix angle, and a fixed position of residues homologous to Asp-80 in KcsA was used previously for modeling of GluR1 (18Tikhonov D.B. Mellor J.R. Usherwood P.N.R. Magazanik L.G. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1884-1893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because this approach neglects ion-water interactions, the remaining parts of the receptor and the lipids of the membrane, the proposed models have known limitations (18Tikhonov D.B. Mellor J.R. Usherwood P.N.R. Magazanik L.G. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1884-1893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We individually expressed each of the ten native C. elegans glutamate receptor subunits (GLR1 through GLR8, and NMR1 to NMR2) in Xenopus oocytes and tested for GLU-, kainate-, or AMPA-evoked currents while voltage clamping the oocyte at –70 mV. NMR1 and NMR2 were additionally tested for GLU + glycine-activated currents. Surprisingly, we were unable to record any agonist-evoked currents from any of the C. elegans subunits. We also tested for one subunit, GLR1, in human embryonic kidney cells rather than Xenopus oocytes, to determine whether currents could be recorded. Again, we could not evoke currents, either from GLR1 alone or from GLR1 coinjected with GLR2 in human embryonic kidney cells (data not shown). To test whether the apparent lack of agonist-evoked currents was simply the result of rapid desensitization kinetics, we applied agonist after preincubation with ConA (10 μm), or we coapplied agonist with cyclothiazide (100 μm). ConA and cyclothiazide are inhibitors of desensitization for kainate and AMPA receptors, respectively (19Partin K.M. Patneau D.K. Winters C.A. Mayer M.L. Buonanno A. Neuron. 1993; 11: 1069-1082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). We also varied the holding potential from –150 mV to +50 mV and applied agonists at a range of different membrane potentials. None of these manipulations produced any agonist-evoked currents, suggesting that either homomeric receptors are not functional or that we cannot detect rapid desensitization that is not blocked by standard pharmacological agents. Also, several coexpression experiments of GLR subunits (GLR1 + GLR2, GLR2 + GLR3, GLR6 + GLR8, GLR1 through GLR8 combined) failed to produce any currents (data not shown). It is possible that C. elegans glutamate receptor proteins are not expressed in Xenopus oocytes. However, the availability of antibodies directed against one subunit, GLR1, enabled us to show by Western blot that GLR1 was indeed expressed and incorporated into the oocyte plasma membrane (Fig. 2), and we assume that the other subunits, for which no antibodies are available, are expressed as well. For vertebrate glutamate receptors, expression of all subunits in oocytes has been demonstrated (13Everts I. Villmann C. Hollmann M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 861-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The lack of currents at C. elegans glutamate receptor subunits might reflect ion pores that are nonfunctional, or of extremely low conductance, or it might reflect dependence on other receptor subunits, defective folding, assembly, or trafficking of receptor subunits, altered ligand binding, or modified gating of the receptor subunit. Most of these possibilities are difficult to test because a functional C. elegans glutamate receptor complex may have a complicated subunit stoichiometry, may depend on C. elegans-specific assembly machinery that is poorly conserved in vertebrate cells, and/or may also require other gene products. To circumvent these difficulties, we determined the ion permeation properties of the predicted pore-forming regions by transplanting the ion pore domains of C. elegans receptor subunits into rat glutamate receptor subunits GluR1, GluR6, and NMDAR1-1a. We have shown previously that ion pore transplantation between vertebrate receptor subunits is a powerful method to study the properties of individual pore domains from subunits that do not form functional homomeric channels (11Villmann C. Strutz N. Morth T. Hollmann M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1765-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Villmann C. Bull L. Hollmann M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7634-7643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Strutz N. Villmann C. Breitinger H.-G. Werner M. Wenthold R.J. Kizelsztein P. Teichberg V.I. Hollmann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48035-48042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We now extend this method to invertebrate receptor subunits. We transplanted the C. elegans pores into the rat kainate receptor subunit GluR6, the rat AMPA subunit GluR1, and the rat NMDA receptor subunit NMDAR1-1a. These wild type mammalian receptors, when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, are functional, and currents can be recorded in the presence of glutamate receptor agonists. In addition, the ion pores of these receptor subunits share appreciable amino acid identity with the pores of C. elegans glutamate receptor subunits (Fig. 1). We recorded agonist-gated currents under conditions designed to reduce the extent of desensitization. Thus, for GluR6 chimeras, currents were recorded in the presence of concanavalin A (see “Experimental Procedures”). For GluR1 chimeras, a point mutation (L479F) was introduced into all constructs. This mutation has previously been shown to reduce desensitization dramatically (10Stern-Bach Y. Russo S. Neuman M. Rosenmund C. Neuron. 1998; 21: 907-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).

All eight non-NMDA receptor subunit pores, GLR1 through GLR8, were functional in either the GluR6 or the GluR1(L479F) sequence background, or in both. The current amplitudes observed varied from 5 nA (GluR6-PGLR6) to 10 μA (GluR6-PGLR4) (Table I and Fig. 3). The pore-forming regions of glutamate receptor subunits are stretches of mostly hydrophobic amino acids that form hairpin loops (P-loops) that do not traverse the membrane (21Hollmann M. Maron C. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1331-1343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). These regions contain amino acids that have been shown to control channel properties tightly in mammalian ionotropic glutamate receptors (1Hollmann M. Jonas P. Monyer H. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology: Iononotropic Glutamate Receptors in the CNS. Springer Verlag, Berlin1999: 3-98Google Scholar). In mammalian non-NMDA receptors, a conserved glutamine in the P-loop is a key determinant of permeation of calcium ions, single channel conductance, blockade by intracellular polyamines causing inward rectification, and permeation of anions (17Burnashev N. Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B. Neuron. 1992; 8: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar, 22Hume R.I. Dingledine R. Heinemann S.F.

Villarroel A. Sakmann B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 496: 165-173Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In a subset of subunits, this conserved glutamine can be transcriptionally post-converted to an arginine by a process called RNA editing (25Sommer B. Kohler M. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H.

Receptors that contain a subunit with an arginine at this position, named the Q/R site, have a significantly reduced calcium permeability (17Burnashev N. Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B.

Transgenic mice that express the nonedited form in place of the edited form develop seizures and die at a young age (26Higuchi M. Maas S. Single F.N. Hartner J. Rozov A. Burnashev N. Feldmeyer D. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 2000; 406: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). In C. elegans, there is no evidence for RNA editing at the Q/R sites. However, five of the eight subunits predicted to represent non-NMDA receptor subunits contain the conserved glutamine in the P-loop. Three of the receptors have a basic amino acid (GLR5: lysine; GLR6: arginine, genome-encoded, not edited) or a proline (GLR7) substituted for the conserved glutamine. A proline does not occur naturally in any other glutamate receptor and, to our knowledge, has not been experimentally introduced into a glutamate receptor. We expected that the proline in GLR7 would disrupt channel conductance because most mutations at the Q/R site rendered the receptors nonfunctional (27Dingeldine R. Hume R.I. Heinemann S.F. J.
