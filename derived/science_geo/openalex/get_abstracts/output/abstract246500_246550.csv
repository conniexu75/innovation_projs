Its zeotype cubic structure has a giant cell volume (∼702,000 cubic angstroms), a hierarchy of extra-large pore sizes (∼30 to 34 angstroms), and a Langmuir surface area for N 2 of ∼5900 ± 300 square meters per gram. Beside the usual properties of porous compounds, this solid has potential as a nanomold for monodisperse nanomaterials, as illustrated here by the incorporation of Keggin polyanions within the cages."

Here we demonstrate that NF-κB signaling in microglia is critically involved in neuronal death induced by amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, which are widely presumed to cause Alzheimer disease. Constitutive inhibition of NF-κB signaling in microglia by expression of the nondegradable IκBα superrepressor blocked neurotoxicity, indicating a pivotal role for microglial NF-κB signaling in mediating Aβ toxicity. Stimulation of microglia with Aβ increased acetylation of RelA/p65 at lysine 310, which regulates the NF-κB pathway. Overexpression of SIRT1 deacetylase and the addition of the SIRT1 agonist resveratrol markedly reduced NF-κB signaling stimulated by Aβ and had strong neuroprotective effects. Our results support a glial loop hypothesis by demonstrating a critical role for microglial NF-κB signaling in Aβ-dependent neurodegeneration. They also implicate SIRT1 in this pathway and highlight the therapeutic potential of resveratrol and other sirtuin-activating compounds in Alzheimer disease.

Neurodegenerative diseases appear to be caused by pathogenic proteins that affect neurons directly or contribute to neuronal death by engaging neurotoxic pathways in surrounding glia (1Walker L.C.

High concentrations of fibrillar Aβ can activate microglia, resulting in tumor necrosis factor-α-dependent expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) and neuronal apoptosis (6Combs C.K. Karlo J.C. Kao S.C. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1179-1188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonfibrillar Aβ, which may be the major pathogenic form of Aβ in the early stages of AD, also stimulates microglia to induce neurodegeneration. Dimeric and trimeric assemblies of Aβ-(1-42) isolated from amyloid deposits elicited profound neurotoxicity in hippocampal neurons but only in the presence of microglia (7Roher A.E. Chaney M.O.

Stimulation with soluble Aβ caused microglia to secrete toxic factors, including cathepsin B, and mediated neurodegeneration (8Gan L. Ye S. Chu A. Anton K.E. Yi S. Vincent V.A. von Schack D. Chin D.

We hypothesized that the pathogenic engagement of microglia by Aβ involves activation of NF-κB, a transcription factor that mediates immune and inflammatory responses (10May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar) and controls the expression of both iNOS and cathepsin B (11Bien S. Ritter C.A. Gratz M. Sperker B.

In AD brains, RelA/p65 immunoreactivity is greater in neurons and astrocytes surrounding amyloid plaques, raising the possibility of a role for NF-κB in AD pathogenesis (13Kaltschmidt B. Uherek M. Volk B. Baeuerle P.A. Kaltschmidt C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2642-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). In cultured neurons and glia, Aβ stimulation led to NF-κB activation (12Akama K.T. Albanese C. Pestell R.G. Van Eldik L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, it remains unclear whether NF-κB signaling actually contributes to AD-related neurodegeneration. To test our hypothesis, we took advantage of the fact that NF-κB activation is tightly regulated by inhibitory proteins, such as IκBα (16Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). In response to stimuli, IκBα is degraded to release the NF-κB p50/RelA heterodimer, which rapidly translocates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of NF-κB-inducible target genes (17Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 18Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Kronke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Replacing two critical N-terminal serines (Ser32 and Ser36) with alanines results in the IκBα superrepressor (IκBα-SR), which effectively suppresses NF-κB signaling (19Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). We used this superrepressor to suppress NF-κB signaling specifically in microglia. NF-κB signaling is also modulated by post-translational modifications, including reversible acetylation of the RelA/p65 subunit (20Chen L. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). For example, full transcriptional activity of RelA/p65 requires acetylation of Lys310, which can be deacetylated by SIRT1, a class III histone deacetyltransferase (21Yeung F. Hoberg J.E. Ramsey C.S. Keller M.D. Jones D.R. Frye R.A. Mayo M.W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2369-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). Activation of SIRT1 by resveratrol, a potent small molecule agonist (22Howitz K.T. Bitterman K.J. Cohen H.Y. Lamming D.W. Lavu S. Wood J.G. Zipkin R.E. Chung P. Kisielewski A. Zhang L.L. Scherer B. Sinclair D.A. Nature. 2003; 425: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (3202) Google Scholar), inhibits NF-κB signaling by promoting deacetylation of Lys310 of RelA/p65 (21Yeung F. Hoberg J.E. Ramsey C.S. Keller M.D. Jones D.R. Frye R.A. Mayo M.W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2369-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). In this study, we assessed the role of NF-κB signaling in microglia-mediated Aβ toxicity in mixed cortical neuronal/glial cultures. We also determined whether agents that enhance RelA/p65 deacetylation protect against Aβ-dependent neurodegeneration. Primary Neuronal Culture—Cortices were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rat pups (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) on postnatal day 0 or 1. To establish mixed cortical cultures, cells were plated at 160,000 cells/ml in plating medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 mm Glutamax, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. After 6 days, the medium was replaced with Neurobasal A medium supplemented with N2 (NBA/N2). All treatments were conducted on day 7 in NBA/N2. Tissue culture supplies were purchased from Invitrogen unless stated otherwise. Aβ and Other Treatments—Aβ-(1-42) and control reverse Aβ-(42-1) peptides lyophilized in hydroxyfluroisopropanol were obtained from California Peptide (Napa, CA) or rPeptide (Athens, GA). Lyophilized Aβ powder was reconstituted immediately before use in dry dimethyl sulfoxide at 2.2 μm and diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium at 40 μm. The nonfibrillar Aβ solutions were further diluted in NBA/N2 medium to 10-20 μm. Atomic force microscopy revealed no fibrillar structures in this type of Aβ preparation (data not shown). To eliminate microglia in mixed cortical cultures, cultures were treated with either Ac-LDL-SAP (Advanced Targeting Systems, San Diego, CA) at 3 μg/ml for 18 h or 5 mm leucine methyl ester (LME) (Sigma) for 12 h. These agents selectively kill microglia in mixed cultures. To assess the effects of resveratrol (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA)onNF-κB activation and Aβ toxicity, primary cultures were treated initially with resveratrol for 60 min and then with resveratrol-containing Aβ solution (final concentrations: resveratrol, 30-50 μm; Aβ, 10 μm). Lentiviral Vectors—To generate the Lenti-κB-dEGFP reporter construct for detecting induction of transcriptionally active NF-κB, an intermediary plasmid (5× κB d1EGFP/pGL3 Basic) was constructed by ligation of three fragments: a BamHI/EcoRI fragment from pNF-κB luc (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) that contains 5× NF-κB binding sites followed by a TATA box, a d1EGFP cDNA (EcoRI/XbaI) from pd1EGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences), and a BglII/XbaI fragment containing S40 late poly(A) signal/ampicillin-resistant gene/f1 ori from pGL3 Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). The fragment containing 5× NF-κB/TATA/d1EGFP was then isolated from the intermediary plasmid and cloned into the pRRLsin.hPGK.MCS.Wpre (46Follenzi A. Ailles L.E. Bakovic S. Geuna M. Naldini L. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar) by replacing the EGFP. The resulting NF-κB lentiviral reporter construct (Lenti-κB-dEGFP) was verified by sequencing the fragment containing 5× NF-κB/TATA/d1EGFP. To inhibit NF-κB signaling, we generated lentiviral vectors expressing an IκBα-SR-EGFP fusion protein under the control of the ubiquitin-C promoter (Lenti-IκBα-SR) or IκBα-SR-His under the control of the promoter of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF) gene (Lenti-MCSF-IκBα-SR). The IκBα-SR-EGFP construct (47Sun S. Elwood J. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1058-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was generated by cloning IκBα (SS/AA) cDNA (HindIII/XbaI) into pEGFP-C3 (HindIII/XbaI). After isolation by PCR using a high fidelity polymerase (Roche Applied Science), the IκBα-SR-EGFP construct was inserted into the AscI and BstEII sites of the modified Lenti-EGFP vector, also known as FUGW (48Lois C. Hong E.J. Pease S. Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 295: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar), to generate Lenti-IκBα-SR. To generate Lenti-MCSF-EGFP, the MCSF promoter was isolated from pSK-cFms (a gift from Dr. Toru Miyazaki, Friedrich Miescher Institute, Basel, Switzerland, and Dr. Stella E. Tsirka, SUNY, Stony Brook, NY) (49Siao C.-J. Fernandez S.R. Tsirka S.E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3234-3242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to replace the ubiquitin promoter of Lenti-EGFP. To generate Lenti-MCSF-IκBα-SR, IκBα-SR-His cDNA was isolated by PCR with high fidelity polymerase to replace the EGFP gene (BamHI/EcoRI) of Lenti-MCSF-EGFP. Appropriate construction was verified by sequencing the ligation junctions. The expression of the fusion protein was confirmed by Western blots with anti-IκBα and anti-EGFP antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The FUGW vector was a kind gift from Dr. David Baltimore (California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA). For expression of SIRT1, a lentiviral vector expressing human SIRT1 was generated (Lenti-SIRT1). The human SIRT1 cDNA (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was isolated by PCR using a high fidelity polymerase (Roche Applied Science) and cloned into the AscI and BstEII sites of the modified FUGW vector to generate Lenti-SIRT1. Recombinant lentivirus was generated by cotransfecting the transfer vector with two helper plasmids, delta8.9 (packaging vector) and VSV-G (envelope vector), into 293T cells (American Type Culture Collection) and purified by ultracentrifugation. Viral titers were determined with p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA) at the Gladstone-UCSF Laboratory of Clinical Virology. Immunocytochemistry and Cell Death Quantification—Cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (135 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 43 mm Na2HPO4,14mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) for 30 min at room temperature. After permeabilization in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton for 10 min, cells were placed in blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.01% Triton) for 30 min. The primary antibodies to MAP2 (1:500; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and GFAP (1:1000; DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) were applied in this blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C and visualized with anti-mouse (MAP2) or anti-rabbit (GFAP) conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate or Texas Red (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). For immunostaining of microglia with CD11b, similar procedures were conducted under nonpermeabilizing conditions by omitting Triton in all solutions. In some cases, microglia were labeled with tomato lectin (1:500; Vector Laboratories) in blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 5% normal goat serum) overnight at 4 °C and visualized with Texas Red NeutrAvidin (1:400; Molecular Probes, Inc., Carlsbad, CA). To measure neuronal loss in mixed cultures, MAP2-positive neurons were counted in 15-40 random fields under a fluorescence microscope (×400 magnification). Quantification of NF-κB Signaling in Microglial Cells and Cortical Cultures—Microglial BV2 cells infected with Lenti-κB-dEGFP were pretreated with 10 μm BAY11-7082 (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) for 2 h before being treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (10 ng/ml) for additional 4-6 h. The destabilized enhanced green fluorescent protein (dEGFP) expression was quantified with a plate reader at 485-nm excitation and 530-nm emission (Wallac 1420 Victor; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Mixed cortical cultures were infected with Lenti-κB-dEGFP alone or in combination with Lenti-IκBα-SR or Lenti-SIRT1 after 3-5 days in vitro. Cells were then treated with Aβ-(1-42) (10-20 μm)in the presence or absence of resveratrol after 5-6 days. Cells with strong EGFP expression were counted in 15-20 random fields under a fluorescence microscope (×200 magnification). BrdUrd Incorporation—Cell proliferation was measured with Cell Proliferation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Roche Applied Science) as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, cells were prelabeled with 10 μm BrdUrd for 12-18 h, fixed, and incubated with anti-BrdUrd-POD. Substrate was added, and proliferation was quantified with an automated plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Real Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Expression of iNOS in BV2 microglial cells was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA in BV2 cells or mixed primary cortical cultures was isolated with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) or with an RNA shredder and RNeasy Mini kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After treatment with RNase-free DNase (Ambion) for 30 min at 37 °C, total RNA (60 ng/μl) was reverse transcribed with random hexamers and oligo(dT) primers. The expression level of iNOS relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was determined by SYBR green dye chemistry and the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), as recommended by the manufacturer. Primer quality was verified by dissociation curve analysis, the slopes of standard curves, and reactions without RT. The following primers were used: mouse iNOS (forward, 5′-AACTGTAGCACAGCACAGGA-3′; reverse, 5′-CCAGAGCCTGAAGTATGTT-3′), mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (forward, 5′-GGGAAGCCCATCACCATCTT-3′; reverse, 5′-GCCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAA-3′), rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (forward, 5′-CTCAAGATTGTCAGCAATGC-3′; reverse, 5′-ACAACTTTGGCATCGTGGAA-3′), rat iNOS (forward, 5′-A-GCTGTAGCACTGCATCAGA-3′; reverse, 5′-ATCAGGTCGGCCATTACTGT-3′), and rat IκBα (forward, 5′-ATGGTGAAGGAGCTGCGGGAGA-3′; reverse, 5′-AGACTCGTTCCTGCACTTGGCA-3′). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were carried out with Graphpad Prism (San Diego, CA). Unless otherwise indicated, differences among means were evaluated by analysis of variance, followed by the Tukey-Kramer post hoc test, as indicated. Unpaired two-tailed Student's t test was used to evaluate differences between two means, as indicated. The null hypothesis was rejected at the 0.05 level. Microglia Mediate Aβ Toxicity in Mixed Primary Cortical Cultures—Mixed neuronal-glial cultures (Fig. 1A) were established from rat neonatal cortices containing MAP2-positive neurons (38 ± 4%), GFAP-positive astrocytes (51 ± 11%), and CD11b-positive microglia (13 ± 3%) and treated with freshly solubilized nonfibrillar Aβ-(1-42) or the control reverse Aβ-(42-1) peptide. As shown by Western blot, the nonfibrillar Aβ-(1-42) solutions contained monomers and small amounts of high molecular mass species (Fig. 1B). Atomic force microscopy and electron microscopy revealed no fibril structures in the preparations (data not shown). After 24 and 48 h in culture, the fraction of high molecular mass Aβ increased slightly (Fig. 1B, arrow). The addition of Aβ-(1-42) (10 μm), but not the reverse control peptide Aβ-(42-1), elicited a profound loss of MAP2-positive neurons in mixed cortical cultures, and the surviving MAP2-positive neurons exhibited shorter dendritic processes (Fig. 1C). No significant loss of GFAP-positive astrocytes was observed (Fig. 1C). On average, only about 20% of MAP2-positive neurons survived treatment with Aβ-(1-42); the reverse peptide Aβ-(42-1) elicited much less toxicity (Fig. 1, C and D). In Aβ-(1-42)-treated cultures, the marked loss of MAP2-positive neurons was associated with a dose-dependent increase in cell proliferation, quantified by BrdUrd incorporation; Aβ-(42-1) had no significant effect on cell proliferation (Fig. 1E). Immunocytochemical studies revealed that Aβ-(1-42) significantly increased the number of CD11b-positive microglia (Fig. 1F) but not GFAP-positive astrocytes (data not shown). These findings show that nonfibrillar Aβ-(1-42) induces neurotoxic effects associated with an increase in microglial cell numbers. To assess whether microglia are required for Aβ-(1-42)-induced neurotoxicity, we first eliminated microglia by treating the mixed cultures with 3 μg/ml acetylated low density lipoprotein saporin (Ac-LDL-SAP), a toxin conjugated to a ligand (Ac-LDL) targeting a microglia-specific scavenger receptor. This treatment eliminated over 80% of CD11b-positive microglia and had little effect on the viability of neurons and astrocytes in the absence of Aβ (data not shown), consistent with previous studies (7Roher A.E. Chaney M.O. Kuo Y.M. Webster S.D. Stine W.B. Haverkamp L.J. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Tuohy J.M. Krafft G.A. Bonnell B.S. Emmerling M.R. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6021-6037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this reduction in the number of microglia markedly attenuated neuronal death after exposure to Aβ-(1-42) (Fig. 1G). In addition, microglia were depleted by treatment with 5 mm LME, a compound that causes lysosome-mediated cell death primarily of microglia (24Hewett J.A. Hewett S.J. Winkler S. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 56: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 25Sawada T. Hashimoto S. Tohma S. Nishioka Y. Nagai T. Sato T. Ito K. Inoue T. Iwata M. Yamamoto K. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 49: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Incubation with LME for 12 h eliminated about 50% of CD11b-positive microglia without affecting other cell types (data not shown). This treatment also significantly decreased Aβ-induced neurotoxicity (Fig. 1G). Therefore, the marked neurotoxicity induced by nonfibrillar Aβ in mixed cortical cultures is dependent on the presence of microglia. Aβ Activates NF-κB Signaling in Glia—To investigate the role of NF-κB signaling in microglia-dependent Aβ toxicity, we first determined whether nonfibrillar Aβ activates NF-κB signaling in primary microglia. A lentiviral vector expressing dEGFP under the control of the 5× κB enhancer element (Lenti-κB-dEGFP; Fig. 2A) was used to assess NF-κB signaling in specific cell types. With its short half-life (1-2 h), the dEGFP gene is suitable for detecting the inducible activation of NF-κB (26Li X. Zhao X. Fang Y. Jiang X. Duong T. Fan C. Huang C.C. Kain S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34970-34975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). BAY11-7082, a specific inhibitor of NF-κB signaling, inhibited LPS-induced dEGFP expression in microglial BV2 cells infected with Lenti-κB-dEGFP, confirming that the dEGFP expression under the control of κB enhancer elements was NF-κB-dependent (Fig. 2B). In primary microglia infected with Lenti-κB-dEGFP, low levels of EGFP expression were detected in the absence of stimuli. Exposure to Aβ-(1-42) significantly increased EGFP expression, indicating activation of NF-κB signaling by Aβ in primary microglia (Fig. 2C). Aβ-(1-42) also activated NF-κB signaling in mixed cortical cultures infected with Lenti-κB-dEGFP. In the absence of Aβ treatment, these cultures showed low levels of dEGFP expression and intact neurons with normal MAP2 immunostaining (Fig. 2D). Treatment with Aβ markedly increased EGFP expression in nonneuronal cells and significantly decreased the survival of MAP2-positive neurons (Fig. 2D). EGFP expression was colocalized with CD11b and GFAP immunoreactivity but not with MAP2 (Fig. 2, D and E), suggesting that nonfibrillar Aβ stimulates NF-κB activation in both microglia and astrocytes but not in neurons. Aβ-stimulated NF-κB activation was further confirmed with the increased expression of NF-κB target genes, iNOS (Fig. 2F) and IκBα (Fig. 2G), quantified with real time RT-PCR. Inhibition of NF-κB Signaling Protects against Microglia-dependent Aβ Toxicity—To determine whether NF-κB activation plays an important role in microglia-dependent Aβ toxicity, we inhibited NF-κB signaling in cortical cultures by infecting them with lentiviral vectors expressing the IκBα superrepressor (IκBα-SR) fused to the C terminus of EGFP under the control of the ubiquitin promoter (Lenti-IκBα-SR). Immunostaining with anti-EGFP and anti-MAP2 (Fig. 3A) revealed expression of the IκBα-SR-EGFP fusion protein in both neuronal (arrow) and nonneuronal cells. Compared with cultures infected with Lenti-κB-dEGFP alone, cultures doubly infected with Lenti-κB-dEGFP and Lenti-IκBα-SR had markedly suppressed Aβ-stimulated dEGFP expression (Fig. 3, B and D). In addition, more MAP2-positive neurons survived Aβ-(1-42) treatment in cultures expressing IκBα-SR (Fig. 3, C and E). These results indicate that NF-κB activation plays a critical role in mediating Aβ toxicity in mixed cortical cultures. To determine whether NF-κB signaling specifically in microglia is responsible for the toxicity of nonfibrillar Aβ in those cultures, we restricted expression of IκBα-SR to microglia with the microglia-specific MCSF promoter (Lenti-MCSF-IκBα-SR). In cultures infected with the control lentiviral vector expressing EGFP (Lenti-MCSF-EGFP), the MCSF promoter-directed EGFP expression was localized primarily in tomato lectin-labeled microglia and not in MAP2-positive neurons or GFAP-positive astrocytes (Fig. 4A). Expression of IκBα-SR in microglia significantly increased the survival of MAP2-positive neurons (Fig. 4B) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that NF-κB signaling in microglia plays a pivotal role in Aβ-dependent neurodegeneration in mixed cortical cultures. SIRT1 Overexpression and Resveratrol Inhibit Aβ-stimulated NF-κB Signaling and Protect against Aβ Toxicity—Regulation of NF-κB signaling involves modulation of the acetylation status of its RelA subunit by p300 and CREB-binding protein acetyltransferases or by HDAC3 and SIRT1 deacetylase (20Chen L. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar, 21Yeung F. Hoberg J.E. Ramsey C.S. Keller M.D. Jones D.R. Frye R.A. Mayo M.W.

To further probe the molecular mechanisms underlying NF-κB activation in Aβ-stimulated mixed cortical cultures, agents promoting deacetylation of RelA/p65 were used to modulate NF-κB signaling. The effects of SIRT1 overexpression on NF-κB signaling were assessed by counting EGFP-expressing cells in cultures infected with Lenti-κB-dEGFP in the presence or absence of Lenti-SIRT1. Western blots confirmed that infection of Lenti-SIRT1 resulted in elevated levels of SIRT1 (supplemental Fig. 1). In cultures infected with Lenti-κB-dEGFP alone (control), Aβ induced a significant increase in the number of dEGFP-expressing cells, most of which were glia (Fig. 5, A and B). Overexpression of SIRT1, however, markedly reduced Aβ-stimulated EGFP expression, suggesting that SIRT1 deacetylase blocked the up-regulation of NF-κB signaling by Aβ-(1-42) (Fig. 5, A and B). The addition of resveratrol, a polyphenol compound that activates SIRT1, also blocked Aβ-induced dEGFP expression, indicating that resveratrol strongly attenuates Aβ-stimulated NF-κB signaling in glial cells (Fig. 5, A and B). We further explored this effect in microglial BV2 cells; treatment with LPS for 3 or 6 h drastically increased the levels of iNOS mRNA, a well established NF-κB target gene. In the presence of 30 μm resveratrol, the levels of LPS-induced iNOS mRNA were markedly lower (Fig. 5C). This result confirms the inhibitory effect of resveratrol on NF-κB signaling in microglia. Full transcriptional activity of RelA/p65 requires acetylation of Lys310 (20Chen L. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C.

Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar), we found that Aβ-(1-42)-induced NF-κB activation was associated with increased levels of acetylated Lys310 (Fig. 5D). Treatment with resveratrol diminished the levels of RelA/p65 with acetylated Lys310, but not of total RelA/p65 (Fig. 5D). Consistent with a previous study (21Yeung F. Hoberg J.E. Ramsey C.S.

Klotho protein was recently demonstrated to function as a hormone that inhibits insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling. Here we show that Klotho protein increases resistance to oxidative stress at the cellular and organismal level in mammals. Klotho protein activates the FoxO forkhead transcription factors that are negatively regulated by insulin/IGF-1 signaling, thereby inducing expression of manganese superoxide dismutase. This in turn facilitates removal of reactive oxygen species and confers oxidative stress resistance. Thus, Klotho-induced inhibition of insulin/IGF-1 signaling is associated with increased resistance to oxidative stress, which potentially contributes to the anti-aging properties of klotho."

The protein unfolds in a two-state manner and refolds through an intermediate that correlates with the transient molten globule-like intermediate observed in bulk studies. This intermediate displays unusual mechanical compliance and unfolds at substantially lower forces than the native state. In a narrow range of forces, the molecule hops between the unfolded and intermediate states in real time. Occasionally, hopping was observed to stop as the molecule crossed the folding barrier directly from the intermediate, demonstrating that the intermediate is on-pathway. These studies allow us to map the energy landscape of RNase H."

https://openalex.org/W2033552170,"Voyager 1 (V1) began measuring precursor energetic ions and electrons from the heliospheric termination shock (TS) in July 2002. During the ensuing 2.5 years, average particle intensities rose as V1 penetrated deeper into the energetic particle foreshock of the TS. Throughout 2004, V1 observed even larger, fluctuating intensities of ions from 40 kiloelectron volts (keV) to ≥50 megaelectron volts per nucleon and of electrons from &gt;26 keV to ≥350 keV. On day 350 of 2004 (2004/350), V1 observed an intensity spike of ions and electrons that was followed by a sustained factor of 10 increase at the lowest energies and lesser increases at higher energies, larger than any intensities since V1 was at 15 astronomical units in 1982. The estimated solar wind radial flow speed was positive (outward) at ∼+100 kilometers per second (km s –1 ) from 2004/352 until 2005/018, when the radial flows became predominantly negative (sunward) and fluctuated between ∼–50 and 0 km s –1 until about 2005/110; they then became more positive, with recent values (2005/179) of ∼+50 km s –1 . The energetic proton spectrum averaged over the postshock period is apparently dominated by strongly heated interstellar pickup ions. We interpret these observations as evidence that V1 was crossed by the TS on 2004/351 (during a tracking gap) at 94.0 astronomical units, evidently as the shock was moving radially inward in response to decreasing solar wind ram pressure, and that V1 has remained in the heliosheath until at least mid-2005."

It is not yet known how this results in liver injury in a subgroup of deficient individuals and how the remainder of deficient individuals escapes liver disease. One possible explanation is that the susceptible subgroup is unable to mount the appropriate protective cellular responses. Here we examined the effect of mutant alpha1ATZ on several potential protective signaling pathways by using cell lines with inducible expression of mutant alpha1AT as well as liver from transgenic mice with liver-specific inducible expression of mutant alpha1AT. The results show that ER retention of polymerogenic mutant alpha1ATZ does not result in an unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR can be induced in the presence of alpha1ATZ by tunicamycin excluding the possibility that the pathway has been disabled. In striking contrast, ER retention of nonpolymerogenic alpha1AT mutants does induce the UPR. These results indicate that the machinery responsible for activation of the UPR can distinguish the physical characteristics of proteins that accumulate in the ER in such a way that it can respond to misfolded but not relatively ordered polymeric structures. Accumulation of mutant alpha1ATZ does activate specific signaling pathways, including caspase-12 in mouse, caspase-4 in human, NFkappaB, and BAP31, a profile that was distinct from that activated by nonpolymerogenic alpha1AT mutants."

After indicated treatments cells were rinsed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice for 20 min in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 10 mm glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, and EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)) containing 0.3% CHAPS. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min, 4 μg of the mTOR antibody was added to the cleared supernatant and incubated under rotation for 90 min. 20 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose was then added, and the incubation continued for 1 h. Captured immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer and once with wash buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 40 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA). Cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and visualized by immunoblotting as described. In vitro mTOR kinase assays were performed as described (8Kim D.-H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M.

Because of the dominant role of nutrients and cellular metabolism in the regulation of the raptor-mTOR pathway, we hypothesized the involvement of a redox-sensitive mechanism in the regulation of the raptor-mTOR complex. This idea predicts a dependence of the raptor-mTOR pathway on oxidizing/reducing reactions of thiol-containing groups within a regulatory component of the pathway. To address this hypothesis, we perturbed the cellular redox state by treating cells with either of two oxidizing compounds, diamide or PAO. Both compounds are commonly used as cell-permeable oxidizing reagents that induce disulfide bonds between the thiol groups of cysteines in proteins (22Kosower E.M. Kosower N.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 23Hoffman R.D. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14005-14011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kalef E. Gitler C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We assessed the effect of these structurally distinct oxidizing compounds on the mTOR pathway by analyzing the rapamycin- and nutrient-sensitive phosphorylation of threonine 389 of the raptor-mTOR substrate S6K1. Treatment of HEK293T cells with diamide or PAO induced the phosphorylation of S6K1 in a concentration-dependent manner with PAO causing a more robust increase in phosphorylation than diamide (Fig. 1A). PAO induced maximal S6K1 phosphorylation at 5 μm whereas a higher concentration of diamide (250 μm) was required to activate S6K1. PAO is known to react simultaneously with the sulfhydryl groups of two closely spaced cysteines (so-called vicinal thiols) (24Kalef E. Gitler C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The more potent stimulatory effect of PAO on S6K1 compared with diamide suggests the involvement of vicinal thiol-reactive groups in the regulation of the raptor-mTOR pathway. Diamide and PAO do not induce the hyperphosphorylation of all kinases because neither oxidant increased the basal phosphorylation state of PKCα (Fig. 1A, lower panel), although S6K1 and PKCα are structurally related AGC (protein kinases A, G, and C) family kinases. Leucine deprivation inhibits the nutrient-sensitive raptor-mTOR pathway, and the readdition of leucine to deprived cells reactivates the phosphorylation of S6K1. Similar to leucine stimulation, incubation of leucine-deprived cells with the oxidizing reagents caused the hyperphosphorylation of S6K1. As above, PAO consistently caused a more robust effect than diamide (Fig. 1B). Thus, the oxidants activate the raptor-mTOR pathway even under nutrient-deprived conditions suggesting that the redox-sensitive mechanism acts downstream of the nutrient sensor. The raptor-mTOR pathway is sensitive to a variety factors besides nutrients, including antimycin (an inhibitor of mitochondrial function), BAPTA (a calcium chelator), 2-deoxyglucose (an inhibitor of glycolysis), TLCK (a protease inhibitor), rapamycin (a raptor-mTOR inhibitor), and LY294002 (inhibitor of kinases with phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-like domains) (8Kim D.-H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1920-1928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To determine the generality of the effect of PAO, we assessed its capacity to increase S6K1 phosphorylation in cells treated with these inhibitors. PAO prevented the decrease in S6K1 phosphorylation caused by antimycin, BAPTA, 2-deoxyglucose, or TLCK treatment of cells (Fig. 1C). In contrast, direct inhibitors of raptor-mTOR, rapamycin and LY294002, prevented the stimulatory effect of PAO on S6K1 phosphorylation, indicating the dependence of the effect of PAO on mTOR kinase activity. The dominant stimulatory effect on S6K1 phosphorylation of PAO over a variety of raptor-mTOR pathway inhibitors suggests that PAO may act at the level of the raptor-mTOR complex instead of interfering with a distinct signaling cascade that also regulates S6K1. Consistent with this, siRNA-induced knock-downs in the expression of either mTOR or raptor diminished the increase in S6K1 phosphorylation caused by diamide and PAO (Fig. 1D). We have previously shown that siRNA-mediated reductions in the expression of raptor also lead to a small decrease in the expression of mTOR and vice versa (8Kim D.-H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). This likely reflects a decreased stability of the proteins in the absence of their partners. We next asked if the raptor-mTOR complex itself is sensitive to diamide or PAO. As we had previously shown that the strength of the interaction between raptor and mTOR is regulated by nutrients and mitochondrial function (8Kim D.-H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar), we analyzed the amount of raptor in mTOR complexes immunopurified from the cells treated with diamide or PAO. The amount of raptor recovered in the mTOR complexes decreased significantly in cells treated with diamide or PAO (Fig. 2A). Moreover, antimycin normally increases the amount of raptor that is recovered bound to mTOR, and the oxidizing reagents prevented this increase. The oxidants do not affect the interaction of mTOR with all proteins, as they do not perturb the interaction between mTOR and rictor or GβL (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the activating effects of the oxidants on the raptor-mTOR pathway in cells, mTOR immunoprecipitates isolated from diamide- or PAO-treated cells exhibited an increase in mTOR kinase activity in vitro toward S6K1 without affecting the levels of mTOR. The raptor-mTOR complex may be the direct target of the oxidizing reagents because incubation of the purified complex with PAO induced disassociation of the complex and increased mTOR kinase activity (Fig. 2B). The effects of the oxidizing reagents on the raptor-mTOR complex suggest a mechanism whereby they could induce the nutrient-independent phosphorylation of S6K1. Thus, the raptor and mTOR interaction may be destabilized by the thiol oxidants, resulting in activation of the raptor-mTOR kinase activity and phosphorylation of its substrate S6K1. The destabilizing effect of the oxidizing reagents on the raptor-mTOR interaction is similar to but stronger than those caused by nutrient stimulation of cells. If PAO acts by forming disulfide bonds between the vicinal thiol groups of proteins, its effects should be reversed by a reducing agent. For this study we selected the cell-permeable reducing reagent BAL because of its known high efficiency in reversing the oxidation reactions induced by PAO (29Bogumil R. Ullrich V. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 30Frost S.C. Schwalbe M.S. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In cells treated with antimycin or in leucine-deprived cells, PAO caused a strong hyperphosphorylation of S6K1 that correlated with a decreased association of the raptor-mTOR interaction (Fig. 3A). The effects of PAO were completely reversed by treating the cells with BAL (Fig. 3A). The addition of BAL resulted in a significant dephosphorylation of S6K1 and was associated with an increase in the amount of raptor recovered with mTOR as is seen in cells in nutrient-deprived conditions (Fig. 3A). If the oxidizing compounds are mimicking an endogenous oxidant that normally activates the raptor-mTOR pathway, the reducing reagent should inhibit pathway activation caused by nutrients. Incubation with BAL of HEK-293T cells growing in nutrient-rich media caused a decrease in S6K1 phosphorylation that correlated with an increase in the amount of raptor recovered with mTOR (Fig. 3B). We also observed similar effects of BAL on the raptor-mTOR complex and S6K1 phosphorylation in leucine-deprived cells simulated with leucine. Thus, the normal nutrient-sensing mechanism that activates raptor-mTOR signaling is susceptible to a reducing environment just as is the artificial activation caused by the diamide and PAO oxidizing reagents. In this study we found that the raptor-mTOR complex can be regulated by a redox-sensitive mechanism. Thiol oxidants induce activation of the raptor-mTOR pathway that correlates with a destabilization of the raptor-mTOR interaction, whereas a reducing reagent inhibits the pathway, and this correlates with a stabilization of the interaction. Our finding suggests that a redox-sensitive switch may contribute to the regulatory mechanism that controls the raptor-mTOR pathway. In this model, mitochondrial metabolism fueled by nutrients would alter the redox environment of the cell and activate the nutrient-sensing raptor-mTOR pathway by modifying a redox-sensitive mechanism on raptor or mTOR. Interestingly, recent work reveals that in yeast TOR the FATC domain may contain a redox sensor (31Dames S.A. Mulet J.M. Rathgeb-Szabo K. Hall M.N. Grzesiek S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20558-20564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), suggesting that mTOR itself may contain the redox-sensitive mechanism. The identification of the thiol-reactive groups involved in regulating the raptor-mTOR complex is an important future goal to test this hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2081580735,"Despite advances in understanding the role of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in tumorigenesis, the mechanism by which HDAC inhibitors mediate antineoplastic effects remains elusive. Modifications of the histone code alone are not sufficient to account for the antitumor effect of HDAC inhibitors. The present study demonstrates a novel histone acetylation-independent mechanism by which HDAC inhibitors cause Akt dephosphorylation in U87MG glioblastoma and PC-3 prostate cancer cells by disrupting HDAC-protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) complexes. Of four HDAC inhibitors examined, trichostatin A (TSA) and HDAC42 exhibit the highest activity in down-regulating phospho-Akt, followed by suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, whereas MS-275 shows only a marginal effect at 5 μm. This differential potency parallels the respective activities in inducing tubulin acetylation, a non-histone substrate for HDAC6. Evidence indicates that this Akt dephosphorylation is not mediated through deactivation of upstream kinases or activation of downstream phosphatases. However, the effect of TSA on phospho-Akt can be rescued by PP1 inhibition but not that of protein phosphatase 2A. Immunochemical analyses reveal that TSA blocks specific interactions of PP1 with HDACs 1 and 6, resulting in increased PP1-Akt association. Moreover, we used isozyme-specific small interfering RNAs to confirm the role of HDACs 1 and 6 as key mediators in facilitating Akt dephosphorylation. The selective action of HDAC inhibitors on HDAC-PP1 complexes represents the first example of modulating specific PP1 interactions by small molecule agents. From a clinical perspective, identification of this PP1-facilitated dephosphorylation mechanism underscores the potential use of HDAC inhibitors in lowering the apoptosis threshold for other therapeutic agents through Akt down-regulation.

Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying the antiproliferative effects of HDAC inhibitors remain elusive. Although they have been shown to activate the transcription of a defined set of genes through chromatin remodeling (4.Thiagalingam S. Cheng K.H. Lee H.J. Mineva N. Thiagalingam A. Ponte J.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 983: 84-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), increasing evidence suggests that modifications of the epigenetic histone code may not represent the primary cause for HDAC inhibitor-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis in cancer cells (5.Brinkmann H. Dahler A.L. Popa C. Serewko M.M. Parsons P.G. Gabrielli B.G. Burgess A.J. Saunders N.A. J. Biol.

To date, at least two distinct histone acetylation-independent mechanisms have been described for the action of HDAC inhibitors on cellular targets. First, because certain HDAC members can mediate the deacetylation of non-histone proteins, their inhibition interferes with signaling processes in which these proteins are involved independently of the activity of HDAC inhibitors in transcriptional activation. For example, HDAC3 regulates NFκB signaling in the nucleus by deacetylation the Rel-A subunit (7.Chen L. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar), and HDAC6 modulates microtubule acetylation and chemotactic cell motility by acting as a tubulin deacetylase (8.Hubbert C.

In this report, we used TSA to demonstrate that HDAC inhibitors facilitate dephosphorylation of Akt by altering the dynamics of HDAC-PP1 complexes. We provide evidence that HDAC inhibitors selectively target HDACs 1 and 6 to disrupt the respective HDAC-PP1 complexes, resulting in increased association of PP1 with Akt. This PP1-facilitated kinase dephosphorylation underscores the diverse functions of HDAC inhibitors in mediating antineoplastic activities at different cellular levels. Cell Culture—U87MG human glioblastoma cells were kindly provided by Dr. Ing-Ming Chiu (The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH), and PC-3 prostate cancer cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Because both U87MG and PC-3 cells are PTEN-null, they exhibit constitutively active Akt.

Protein concentrations of the lysates were determined by using a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Equivalent amounts of proteins from each lysate were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto Immobilon-nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Bellerica, MA) in a semidry transfer cell. The transblotted membrane was washed twice with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). After blocking with TBST containing 5% nonfat milk for 40 min, the membrane was incubated with the appropriate primary antibody in TBST containing 1% nonfat milk at 4 °C overnight. All of the primary antibodies were diluted 1: 2000 in 1% nonfat milk-containing TBST. After treatment with the primary antibody, the membrane was washed two times with TBST for a total of 20 min, followed by goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugates (diluted 1:3000) for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with TBST for a total of 1 h. The immunoblots were visualized by ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Viability Assay—The effect of the HDAC inhibitors on cell viability was assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay in 6-12 replicates. U87MG and PC-3 cells were seeded and incubated in 96-well, flat-bottomed plates in 10% FBS-supplemented RPMI 1640 medium 24 h before drug treatment. The cells were exposed to individual HDAC inhibitors at the indicated concentrations in 10% FBS-supplemented RPMI 1640 medium at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 48 h. The medium was removed and replaced by 200 μl of 0.5 mg/ml of MTT in RPMI 1640 medium, and the cells were incubated in the CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 2 h. Supernatants were removed from the wells, and the reduced MTT dye was solubilized with 200 μl/well Me2SO. Absorbance was determined on a plate reader at 570 nm. Flow Cytometry/Apoptosis Assays—After drug treatment as described above, floating cells were collected, and adherent cells were harvested by scraping. The combined cells were fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol and storage at -20 °C. The cells were centrifuged, washed with PBS, and incubated in 0.2 m phosphate citrate buffer, pH 7.8 at 37 °C to extract low molecular weight DNA. The samples were stained with propidium iodide solution (10 mg/ml) in the presence of RNase A (100 mg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. Cell cycle phase distributions were determined on a FACScort flow cytometer and analyzed by the ModFitLT V3.0 program. Affinity Purification of HDAC-PP1 Complexes—U87MG cells were treated with TSA at the indicated concentrations in 10% FBS-supplemented RPMI 1640 medium for 48 h. Control cells received the vehicle treatment of 0.1% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. The cells were washed by phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by the aforementioned Nonidet P-40 isotonic lysis buffer. Cell extract was incubated with microcystin-LR-Sepharose (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) at 4 °C overnight on a rotator. After a brief centrifugation, Sepharose beads were collected and washed with the lysis buffer four times. The bound proteins were eluted by 50 μl of SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies. Co-immunoprecipitation of PP1-Akt Complexes—U87MG cells were treated with various concentrations of TSA for 48 h and lysed by the aforementioned Nonidet P-40 isotonic lysis buffer with a mixture of protease inhibitors. After centrifugation at 13000 × g for 15 min, the supernatants were collected and incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 15 min to eliminate nonspecific binding. The mixture was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were exposed to Akt or PP1 antibodies in the presence of protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. After a brief centrifugation, protein A-Sepharose beads were collected, washed with the aforementioned lysis buffer four times, suspended in 2× SDS sample buffer, and subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies against PP1 or Akt. Subcellular Fractionation—The nuclear and cytosolic fractions of U87MG cells were prepared by using a nuclear/cytosol fraction kit (MBL Co., Watertown, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, the cells were cultured to 50% confluency in T-75 flasks, treated with TSA for 48 h, and collected by centrifugation. The pelleted cells were resuspended in 0.2 ml of cytosol extraction buffer A mix containing dithiothreitol and a mixture of protease inhibitors and were mixed vigorously on a vortex mixer. The suspension was then incubated on ice for 10 min, mixed with 11 μl of cytosol extraction buffer B, and incubated on ice for 1 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant, representing the cytoplasmic fraction, was transferred to a prechilled tube, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of nuclear extraction buffer mix. The suspension was mixed vigorously on a vortex mixer for 15 s, incubated on ice for 40 min, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min to collect the nuclear extract in the supernatant fraction. Ser/Thr Phosphatase Activity—The Ser/Thr phosphatase activity was determined by using a nonradioactive, malachite green-based Ser/Thr phosphatase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 5 μg of U87MG cell extracts in the aforementioned lysis buffer were incubated with 175 μm of the phosphopeptide substrate (K-R-pT-I-R-R) in the phosphatase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH7.5, 60 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.1 mg/ml serum albumin) with a total volume of 25 μl. The reaction was incubated in a 96-well plate at room temperature for 10 min, terminated by adding the malachite green solution, and allowed to stand for 15 min to permit color development. Absorption at 650 nm was measured in a microplate reader, and the serine/threonine phosphatase activity was calculated using a standard curve based on free phosphate generated by a standard solution. All of the experiments were performed in triplicate. Immunoprecipitated Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase (PI3K) Kinase Assay—PI3K activity was determined by the use of a PI3K enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from Echelon Biosciences Inc. (Salt Lake City, UT) according to the manufacturer's instruction. U87MG cells were cultured to 50% confluency in 10-cm culture dishes, and the medium was removed after TSA treatment. The drug-treated cells were washed with 10 ml/dish of ice-cold buffer A (137 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate) three times, incubated with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (buffer A plus 1% Nonidet P-40 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice for 20 min, scraped from the dish, transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and centrifuged. The supernatant was collected, and the protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (BioRad). Equal amounts of proteins were treated with 5 μl of anti-PI3K antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) at 4 °C for 1 h, to which was added 60 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-agarose beads in PBS, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h with mixing. The immunocomplex was collected by brief centrifugation, washed with lysis buffer three times, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 10 μl of 10 μm l-α-phosphatidyl-d-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate, 5 μl of 10× reaction buffer (40 mm MgCl2, 200 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 250 μm ATP), and 35 μl of distilled water. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2.5 μl of 100 mm EDTA. After brief centrifugation, 50 μl of each reaction mixture was transferred to a 96-well plate, and 50 μl of diluted l-α-phosphatidyl-d-myo-inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) detector was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. 100 μl of reaction mixture from each well was transferred to the corresponding well in the detection plate and incubated at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. After three washes with 300 μl of TBS with Tween 20 (0.05% v/v), 100 μl of the secondary detection reagent was added to each well followed by incubation for 1 h in the dark and three more washes with 300 μl of TBS with Tween 20 (0.05% v/v). 100 μl of tetramethyl benzidine solution was added to each well and incubated for ∼20-30 min to allow color development. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of stop solution (0.5 m H2SO4) to each well. Absorbance at 450 nm was read, and the PI3K activity in each sample was calculated using a standard curve generated by using a PIP3 standard solution. All of the experiments were performed in triplicate. Autoradiographic Determination of Phosphoinositide Formation—U87MG cells, cultured in T25 flasks, were labeled with 1 mCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphate (HCl-free; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's phosphate-free and serum-free medium (Invitrogen) for 4 h, washed three times with buffer A (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 110 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm glucose), and treated with various concentrations of TSA in 10% FBS-supplemented RMPI 1640 medium for 48 h. The cells were extracted with 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v), followed by 4 ml of chloroform, 2.4 m HCl (1:1, v/v), and 1 ml of chloroform four times. The combined organic phase was dried under a stream of nitrogen and resuspended in 90 μl of chloroform for TLC analysis by using a 20 × 20-cm silica gel 60 TLC plate (EM Science) impregnated with 1% potassium oxalate in 50% ethanol. The TLC plate was developed in chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (80:30:26:24:14, v/v/v/v/v) (23.Ching T.T. Lin H.P. Yang C.C. Oliveira M. Lu P.J. Chen C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43932-43938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Radioactive spots were detected by autoradiography using Kodak X-Omat film, and total PIP3 was quantified by both densitometry and an AMBIS B scanning system (San Diego, CA), both of which showed comparable results. Kinase Assay for Phosphoinositide-dependent Kinase-1 (PDK-1)—The PDK-1 kinase activity was performed using a PDK-1 kinase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) according to a described procedure (24.Kulp S.K. Yang Y.T. Hung C.C. Chen K.F. Lai J.P. Tseng P.H. Fowble J.W. Ward P.J. Chen C.S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1444-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This cell-free assay is based on the ability of recombinant PDK-1 to activate its downstream kinase serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase, which in turn phosphorylates the Akt/serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase-specific peptide substrate RPRAATF with [γ-32P]ATP. The 32P-phosphorylated peptide was then separated from residual [γ-32P]ATP by P81 phosphocellulose paper and quantitated by a scintillation counter after three washes with 0.75% phosphoric acid. Isozyme-specific Knockdown of HDACs with siRNA—Isozyme-specific siRNAs were used to attenuate the expression of HDACs 1 and 6 in U87MG cells using reagents obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Transfection of U87MG cells with these siRNA was carried out according to the vendor's instructions. In brief, the cells were cultured to 40-50% confluency in 10% FBS-supplemented antibiotic-free RPMI 1640 medium. The HDAC1 and HDAC6 siRNAs were transfected to the cells by the siRNA transfection reagent (Santa Cruz, CA) to the final concentration of 200 nm. A scramble siRNA was used in parallel experiments as a control. The transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C, and the extents of siRNA-mediated down-regulation of HDAC1 and HDAC6 expression were monitored by immunoblotting analysis at different time intervals. It was found that 30-h exposure to siRNA caused more than 80% repression of HDAC expression, and thus it was used through this study. Immunocytochemical Analysis of TSA-mediated Co-localization of PP1 and Akt—U87MG cells were treated with 0.5 μm TSA in 10% FBS-supplemented RPMI 1640 medium for different time intervals, washed with Dulbecco's PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, and then washed with PBS. For double staining of phospho-Akt and PP1, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1% FBS-containing PBS, treated with rabbit anti-phospho-Ser473-Akt (1:500 dilution) at 4 °C for 24 h, and washed with PBS. Subsequently, the cells were treated with mouse anti-PP1 (1:100 dilution) for 8 h at room temperature and washed with PBS. For fluorescent microscopy, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc.) were used for conjugating PP1 and phospho-Akt, respectively. The nuclear counterstaining was performed using a 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole-containing mounting medium (Vector, CA) prior to examination. Images of immunocytochemically labeled samples were observed using a Zeiss confocal microscope (LSM510) with an argon laser and a helium-neon laser and appropriate filters (excitation wavelength, 488 nm for PP1, 633 nm for p-Akt, and 543 nm for 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole). Differential Effects of HDAC Inhibitors on Akt Dephosphorylation—To shed light onto the causative relationship between HDAC inhibition and Akt deactivation, we assessed the effects of four different HDAC inhibitors, including HDAC42, SAHA, MS-275, and TSA, on various HDAC-related biomarkers (histone H3 acetylation, p21 expression, and tubulin acetylation) vis à vis Akt phosphorylation state in U87MG glioblastoma and PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Of the four HDAC inhibitors examined, HDAC42 belongs to a novel class of phenylbutyrate-based HDAC inhibitors (21.Lu Q. Yang Y.T. Chen C.S. Davis M. Byrd J.C. Etherton M.R. Umar A. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and has an IC50 of 30 nm in inhibiting HDAC activity in nuclear extracts. The reported IC50 values for TSA, SAHA, and MS-275 are 5-15 nm, 120 nm, and 4.8 μm, respectively (2.Miller T.A. Witter D.J. Belvedere S. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 5097-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis shows that exposure of U87MG and PC-3 cells to these inhibitors led to substantial increases in histone H3 acetylation and p21WAF/CIP1 expression (Fig. 1A). However, these four inhibitors behaved differently with regard to α-tubulin acetylation, indicating differences in the respective activities in inhibiting the α-tubulin deacetylase HDAC6 (8.Hubbert C. Guardiola A. Shao R. Kawaguchi Y. Ito A. Nixon A. Yoshida M. Wang X.F. Yao T.P. Nature. 2002; 417: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). Although HDAC42 and TSA produced robust hyperacetylation of α-tubulin at submicromolar concentrations, SAHA was effective at low micromolar concentrations, and MS-275 was totally ineffective, even at 5 μm, in inhibiting tubulin deacetylation. Moreover, examination of Akt phosphorylation at both Thr308 and Ser473 indicates that HDAC42 and TSA at submicromolar concentrations were able to substantially reduce phospho-Akt levels. A similar effect on phospho-Akt was not achieved with SAHA until the concentration reached 5 μm. In contrast, the repressing effect of MS-275 on Akt phosphorylation, even at 5 μm, was marginal. It is noteworthy that there existed an inverse relationship between the levels of acetylated α-tubulin and phospho-Akt, providing a potential link between HDAC6 inhibition and Akt dephosphorylation. This premise was further supported by the differential effect of selective siRNA-mediated knockdown of individual HDAC isozymes on phospho-Akt levels (see"

The average B in the heliosheath from day 1 through day 110 of 2005 was 0.136 +/- 0.035 nanoteslas, approximately 4.2 times that predicted by Parker's model for B. The magnetic field in the heliosheath from day 361 of 2004 through day 110 of 2005 was pointing away from the Sun along the Parker spiral. The probability distribution of hourly averages of B in the heliosheath is a Gaussian distribution. The cosmic ray intensity increased when B was relatively large in the heliosheath."
https://openalex.org/W2093043664,"Although HEF1 has a well-defined role in integrin-dependent attachment signalling at focal adhesions, it relocalizes to the spindle asters at mitosis. We report here that overexpression of HEF1 causes an increase in centrosome numbers and multipolar spindles, resembling defects induced by manipulation of the mitotic regulatory kinase Aurora-A (AurA). We show that HEF1 associates with and controls activation of AurA. We also show that HEF1 depletion causes centrosomal splitting, mono-astral spindles and hyperactivation of Nek2, implying additional action earlier in the cell cycle. These results provide new insight into the role of an adhesion protein in coordination of cell attachment and division."

We used fluorescent probe molecules, pyrene butyric acid (PBA), as guests in C -hexylpyrogallol[4]arene capsules to relay information about the chemical environment on the interior of the assemblies. Spectroscopic and single-crystal x-ray diffraction studies show that, in both solution and the solid state, the host can encapsulate two PBA guests and keep them well separated through specific interactions with the capsule walls."
https://openalex.org/W2164838292,"TRPM4 is a Ca2+-activated nonselective cation channel that regulates membrane potential in response to intracellular Ca2+ signaling. In lymphocytes it plays an essential role in shaping the pattern of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations that lead to cytokine secretion. To better understand its role in this and other physiological processes, we investigated mechanisms by which TRPM4 is regulated. TRPM4 was expressed in ChoK1 cells, and currents were measured in excised patches. Under these conditions, TRPM4 currents were activated by micromolar concentrations of cytoplasmic Ca2+ and progressively desensitized. Here we show that desensitization can be explained by a loss of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) from the channels. Poly-l-lysine, a PI(4,5)P2 scavenger, caused rapid desensitization, whereas MgATP, at concentrations that activate lipid kinases, promoted recovery of TRPM4 currents. Application of exogenous PI(4,5)P2 to the intracellular surface of the patch restored the properties of TRPM4 currents. Our results suggest that PI(4,5)P2 acts to uncouple channel opening from changes in the transmembrane potential, allowing current activation at physiological voltages. These data argue that hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 underlies desensitization of TRPM4 and support the idea that PI(4,5)P2 is a general regulator for the gating of TRPM ion channels.

TRPM4, a member of the melastatin-related branch of the TRP channels, is a monovalent selective ion channel that is activated by cytoplasmic Ca2+ (3Launay P. Fleig A. Perraud A.L. Scharenberg A.M.

TRPM4 is widely expressed, and its primary role appears to be to regulate membrane potential in response to intracellular Ca2+ signaling (3Launay P. Fleig A. Perraud A.L. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Cell. 2002; 109: 397-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). In lymphocytes it is an essential component of the feedback network that generates intracellular Ca2+ oscillations that lead to cytokine secretion (9Launay P. Cheng H. Srivatsan S. Penner R. Fleig A.

Brayden J.E. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 922-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Both TRPM4 and TRPM5 appear to be activated downstream of phospholipase C (PLC) signaling, most likely through the direct effects of store-released Ca2+ on channel gating (3Launay P. Fleig A.

Feng S. Nasuhoglu C. Sci. STKE. 2001; 2001: RE19PubMed Google Scholar, 12Suh B.C. Hille B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar). PI(4,5)P2 serves as the substrate for PLC, which generates the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol. However, in an increasing number of cases it has become apparent that a decrease in PI(4,5)P2, and not the increase in IP3 or diacylglycerol, is the physiologically relevant signal. For instance, KCNQ2/3 channels, which comprise the M current, close in response to the decrease in resting PI(4,5)P2 levels following activation of PLC by Gq-linked membrane receptors (13Suh B.C. Hille B. Neuron. 2002; 35: 507-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 14Zhang H. Craciun L.C. Mirshahi T. Rohacs T. Lopes C.M. Jin T. Logothetis D.E. Neuron. 2003; 37: 963-975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). PI(4,5)P2 has also been shown to be an important regulator of several TRP channels. TRPV1 becomes hypersensitive to heat and capsaicin following hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2, and this underlies the regulation of TRPV1 by inflammatory neurochemicals such as bradykinin (15Chuang H.H.

Neurosci. 2005; 8: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar).The sensitivity of TRPM4 channels to Ca2+ changes subsequent to activation (22Nilius B. Prenen J. Tang J. Wang C. Owsianik G. Janssens A. Voets T. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6423-6433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), which may serve a physiologically important role in allowing the channels to respond over a greater stimulus range. In previous work, we found that TRPM5 channels also desensitize to Ca2+ and that sensitivity could be recovered by exogenous PI(4,5)P2 (6Liu D. Liman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15160-15165Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Similarly it was shown recently that PI(4,5)P2 restores sensitivity of TRPM8 channels to cold and menthol following desensitization (20Liu B. Qin F. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1674-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 21Rohacs T. Lopes C.M. Michailidis I. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). PI(4,5)P2 regulation of TRPM4 thus seems likely. Here we show that TRPM4 currents exhibit pronounced rundown following initial exposure to Ca2+ and that exposure to PI(4,5)P2 leads to full recovery of the currents. Moreover we find that manipulations that are expected to change endogenous PI(4,5)P2 levels predictably enhance or diminish desensitization of TRPM4. Together these data indicate that hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 underlies desensitization of TRPM4.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstructs and Expression in Heterologous Cells—For most experiments we used TRPM4b fused to the C terminus of cyan fluorescent protein under a cytomegalovirus promoter (eGFPC2 vector, Clontech) as described previously (23Liu D. Zhang Z. Liman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20691-20699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For experiments in Fig. 2, D, E, and F, we used human TRPM4b (hTRPM4b) fused to the C terminus of enhanced green fluorescent protein in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) as described previously (23Liu D. Zhang Z. Liman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20691-20699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). ChoK1 cells were plated on glass coverslips and transfected using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) or Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Recordings were performed 48-72 h after transfection at room temperature.Electrophysiology—ChoK1 cells on coverslips were transferred to the recording chamber, and cells expressing CFP-mTRPM4 were identified under epifluorescence. After formation of a gigaohm seal, the patch was excised into zero Ca2+-containing solution (see below) and placed in front of a linear array of microperfusion pipes from which test solutions were delivered (Warner Instruments). For all experiments, the membrane potential was held at -80 mV.The pipette solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.4 with NaOH). Bath (cytosolic) solutions were as follows. Zero Ca2+ solution was 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm HEDTA (pH 7.4 with NaOH). Solutions with micromolar concentrations of free Ca2+ were obtained by adding Ca2+ to this HEDTA-based solution as follows. 1.9 mm CaCl2 was added for 50 μm free Ca2+. Solutions containing 100 μm to 5 mm Ca2+ were made by adding the appropriate concentration of Ca2Cl without buffer to a solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). All Ca2+ concentrations are reported as calculated with MaxChelator (www.stanford.edu/~cpatton/maxc.html) and were confirmed by direct measurement with a Ca2+-sensitive electroprobe (Microelectrodes, Inc., Bedford, NH). Biochemicals used were as follows: diC8-PI(4,5)P2, diC8-PI(3,4)P2, diC8-PI(3,5)P2, diC8-PI(3,4,5)P3, diC8-PI(4)P (Echelon Bioscience, Salt Lake City, UT), MgATP, Na2ATP, poly-l-lysine (4-15 kDa), MgGTP, MgADP, arachidonic acid, LY-294002 hydrochloride (Sigma), 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), and wortmannin (Calbiochem).All recordings were made with an Axopatch 200B amplifier, digitized with a Digidata 1322a, acquired with pClamp 8.2, and analyzed with Clampfit 8.2 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Records were sampled at 5 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. Representative data shown in figures were further decimated 10-fold before exporting into the graphics programs Origin (Microcal, Northampton, MA) and Coreldraw (Corel Corp.). Patch pipettes (1.5-3 megaohms) were fabricated from borosilicate glass.Data Analysis—All data were analyzed by Clampfit (Axon Instruments), and curve fitting and statistical analyses were done in Origin (Microcal). Dose-response curves were fitted according to Equation 1, y=Vmax×[x]nEC50n+[x]n(Eq. 1) where EC50 is the concentration for half-maximal effect, [x] is the concentration of the substance being tested, and n is the Hill coefficient.Determination of conductance as a function of voltage g(V) was obtained by measuring isochronal tail currents (4 ms after the return to the test potential of -120 mV), normalizing the data to the peak current and fitting it with the Boltzmann equation (Equation 2), ggmax=1−1−f1+evm−v1/2dx(Eq. 2) where Vm is the membrane potential, V1/2 is the membrane potential at which the current is half-activated, and f is the fraction of current that is not voltage-sensitive. Data were obtained from excised patches where series resistance was measured to be 4-6 megaohms, and series resistance errors (uncorrected) were less than 25 mV at a test potential of +160 mV.Time constants for deactivation of TRPM4 currents were obtained by fitting the data to Equation 3, I=I∞+Aet/τ1(Eq. 3) where I is the current amplitude, I∞ is the current amplitude at time = ∞, t is time, and τ1 is the time constant. The fraction of current that was voltage-insensitive was calculated as I∞/(I∞ +A).All data are presented as mean ± S.E. In some cases error was small, and error bars are within the symbols. Statistical significance was tested by two-tailed Student's t test.RESULTSRecovery of TRPM4 Currents from Rundown by MgATP—To study second messenger regulation of TRPM4 channels, we expressed mouse TRPM4 fused to cyan fluorescent protein in ChoK1 cells, which otherwise show little endogenous TRPM4-like channel activity. Consistent with previous reports (e.g. Ref. 24Nilius B. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Voets T. Vennekens R. Freichel M. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30813-30820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), in excised inside-out patches, TRPM4 currents could be evoked in response to 100 μm cytosolic Ca2+, and this Ca2+-evoked current ran down over several seconds (Fig. 1A). We will show later that this rundown is associated with a change in Ca2+ sensitivity of the channels, and thus can be formally considered desensitization. The two terms are therefore used interchangeably here. Although the rate of rundown was variable, overall it appeared to be faster at higher cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations (data not shown) as observed for TRPM5 (6Liu D. Liman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15160-15165Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). We also measured TRPM4b currents in whole cell recording from ChoK1 cells. Upon intracellular dialysis of 50 μm Ca2+ large outwardly rectifying currents were activated that decayed at a rate similar to the currents evoked in excised patch recording (see supplemental Fig. 1). All remaining experiments were done in excised patch mode where the intracellular milieu could be rapidly and reproducibly controlled.FIGURE 1MgATP restores TRPM4 currents following desensitization. Inward currents evoked in response to 100 μm cytoplasmic Ca2+ were recorded from inside-out patches from TRPM4-expressing ChoK1 cells (Vm = -80 mV). A, 100 μm Ca2+ evokes a large current that decays to base line in 20 s. Following desensitization, TRPM4 currents can be recovered by a 40-s exposure to MgATP (2 mm MgATP and 2 mm free ATP) but not by free ATP (4 mm). Arrows indicate times at which measurements were made for summary data in B. B, summary data for the recovery of TRPM4 currents by the nucleotides indicated measured as in A. MgATP was tested on all patches and served as a positive control. A subset of patches was tested with each of the other nucleotides: NaATP (4 mm free ATP), MgADP (2 mm MgADP and 2 mm free ATP), and MgGTP (2 mm MgGTP and 2 mm free GTP). To reduce artifacts due to the rundown of the recovery response, the efficacy of MgATP was assessed after that of the test nucleotide (as in A) in the majority of the patches. The number of patches tested is indicated on the graphs in parentheses. Statistical significance was determined by comparing the magnitude of the Ca2+-activated current immediately after desensitization to the magnitude of the Ca2+-activated current after exposure to each nucleotide. **, p < 0.005; ***, p < 0.0005 (Student's two-tailed t test). Note that currents evoked after exposure to MgGTP were not statistically different in magnitude from those after desensitization (p = 0.05), although there was a trend toward great current magnitudes after MgGTP exposure. C, wortmannin but not LY294002 significantly attenuated the ability of MgATP to restore TRPM4 currents following rundown. The experimental protocol was similar to that in A except that experimental cells were preincubated with either wortmannin (50 μm for 5 min) or LY294002 (100 μm for 1 h). Each blocker was also included in the solution that contained MgATP. Untreated control cells were from the same transfection as experimental cells and were tested alternately with experimental cells on the same day. *, p < 0.05 (Student's two-tailed t test). ns, not significant; Ctrl, control; Wort., wortmannin; LY, LY294002.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Previous work has shown that in excised patch recoding mode addition of MgATP to the cytoplasmic/bath solution leads to recovery of TRPM4 currents from rundown (22Nilius B.

Likewise we found that a 40-s exposure of the cytosolic surface of the patch to a Ca2+-free solution containing 2 mm MgATP and 2 mm free ATP produced complete recovery of TRPM4 currents that had been evoked in response to 100 μm cytoplasmic Ca2+ (Fig. 1, A and B). Free adenine nucleotides, including ATP, block TRPM4 and native TRPM4-like channels (25Liman E.R. J. Physiol. 2003; 548: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 26Nilius B. Prenen J. Voets T. Droogmans G. Pfluegers Arch. 2004; 448: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and thus it is possible that the recovery of the currents is related to this blocking effect of ATP. However, free ATP did not promote recovery of TRPM4 currents indicating that these processes are not linked (22Nilius B. Prenen J. Tang J. Wang C. Owsianik G. Janssens A. Voets T. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6423-6433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). Moreover the effect of MgATP lasted tens of seconds after its washout, making it unlikely that this effect was due to direct binding of MgATP to the channel (22Nilius B. Prenen J. Tang J. Wang C. Owsianik G. Janssens A. Voets T. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6423-6433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). MgADP and MgGTP were ineffectual at restoring the TRPM4 current, indicating that this effect is not due to Mg2+ itself (Fig. 1B). Together these data are consistent with the involvement of a kinase in restoration of the current.Cytosolic MgATP has been demonstrated to induce recovery of PI(4,5)P2-sensitive ion channels from rundown (11Hilgemann D.W. Feng S. Nasuhoglu C. Sci. STKE. 2001; 2001: RE19PubMed Google Scholar, 12Suh B.C. Hille B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hilgemann D.W. Ball R. Science. 1996; 273: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) most likely by activating phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases, thereby promoting regeneration of PI(4,5)P2 (28Balla T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 69-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 29Balla T. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2001; 7: 475-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For example, Kir6.2 currents can be recovered by MgATP, and this effect is blocked by the lipid kinase inhibitor wortmannin (27Hilgemann D.W. Ball R. Science. 1996; 273: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 30Xie L.H. Takano M. Kakei M. Okamura M. Noma A. J. Physiol. 1999; 514: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determined whether the ability of MgATP to restore TRPM4 currents could be attributed to activation of a lipid kinase, we tested whether wortmannin, at concentrations that block phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4-kinase (PI4K) and PI 3-kinase (PI3K) (31Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), interfered with MgATP-induced recovery of TRPM4. Preincubation of cells for 5 min with 50 μm wortmannin significantly attenuated the recovery of TRPM4 currents by MgATP (Fig. 1C) supporting a role for PI4K or PI3K in this process. In contrast, we found no effect of the PI3K-specific blocker LY294002 (32Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (100 μm for 1 h) on recovery of TRPM4 currents by MgATP (Fig. 1C), suggesting that this process is not mediated by PI3K.PI(4,5)P2 Recovers TRPM4 Currents from Rundown—These data suggest that the recovery of the TRPM4 current by MgATP might be attributed to an increase in PI(4,5)P2 in the membrane and conversely that the initial rundown of TRPM4 currents might be attributed to a loss of PI(4,5)P2 from the patch. According to this hypothesis, manipulations that deplete PI(4,5)P2 should accelerate decay of the TRPM4 currents. Poly-l-lysine is a PI(4,5)P2 scavenger, and it has been widely used to demonstrate regulation of channels and transporters by endogenous PI(4,5)P2 (11Hilgemann D.W. Feng S. Nasuhoglu C. Sci. STKE. 2001; 2001: RE19PubMed Google Scholar, 12Suh B.C. Hille B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar). In excised patches where TRPM4 currents showed slow rates of rundown, exposure to poly-l-lysine accelerated rundown, supporting a role for PI(4,5)P2 in regulating TRPM4 channel activity (Fig. 2A).If hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 underlies rundown of TRPM4 currents, then application of exogenous PI(4,5)P2 should lead to recovery of the currents. To test this, we waited until TRPM4 currents evoked in response to 100 μm cytoplasmic Ca2+ had run down to less than 50% of their initial level and then applied the diC8, water-soluble form of PI(4,5)P2 (33Lupu V.D. Kaznacheyeva E. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Bezprozvanny I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14067-14070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) to the intracellular surface of excised patches. PI(4,5)P2 (10 μm) in the presence of 100 μm Ca2+ induced a dramatic recovery of the current within ∼30 s (Fig. 2B), and following PI(4,5)P2 washout, currents returned to the desensitized level within ∼30 s. On average we were able to fully recover the TRPM4 currents under these conditions (Fig. 2C). No current was elicited by PI(4,5)P2 (10 μm) in the absence of Ca2+ in patches that displayed robust activation of TRPM4 currents by Ca2+ (n = 9; data not shown). We also tested hTRPM4, which is only 82% identical in amino acid sequence to mouse TRPM4 (mTRPM4). Rundown of hTRPM4 currents in excised patches was accelerated by exposure to poly-l-lysine, and 10 μm PI(4,5)P2 promoted full recovery of hTRPM4 currents (Fig. 2, D, E, and F).These data are consistent with the possibility that PI(4,5)P2 is initially bound to the channel (or a subunit of the channel complex) and unbinding of PI(4,5)P2 underlies rundown. If this is the case, then PI(4,5)P2 should modulate the currents most effectively when they have run down. To test whether this is the case, we took advantage of the fact that in some patches, rundown was slow and incomplete. For example, we found that 30 s after exposure to 100 μm Ca2+, the current had run down less than 50% in seven of 26 patches (Fig. 2G), and in three of these patches it had run down less than 2%. Representative data shown in Fig. 2, G and H, show that PI(4,5)P2 produces a more robust enhancement of the current in patches where the current has run down. To quantify this result, for each recording of TRPM4 currents, we measured the -fold rundown after Ca2+ exposure and the -fold enhancement of the current by PI(4,5)P2. As seen in Fig. 2I, we found a direct correlation between these two processes indicating that PI(4,5)P2 is most effective at enhancing the currents when they have undergone rundown (r = 0.89, p < 0.001, n = 26).Specificity and Sensitivity of Recovery of TRPM4 Currents by PI(4,5)P2— The observed effects of PI(4,5)P2 could be due to the products of its hydrolysis. PI(4,5)P2 can be hydrolyzed by PLC into diacylglycerol and IP3 and by phospholipase A2 into arachidonic acid, and all three of these second messengers have been shown to regulate one or more types of TRP channels (34Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar, 35Chyb S. Raghu P. Hardie R.C.

Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Moreover IP3, along with PI(4,5)P2, binds to some pleckstrin homology domains (38Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus we tested the ability of each of these second messengers to restore TRPM4 currents following rundown. No restoration of the TRPM4 current was observed in response to application of either arachidonic acid (50 μm), 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (the diC8 analog of diacylglycerol; 50 μm), or IP3 (10 μm) in the same patches in which robust restoration of the current by PI(4,5)P2 was observed (Fig. 3, A and B). We conclude that the ability of PI(4,5)P2 to restore TRPM4 currents following rundown is not due to effects of products of its hydrolysis.FIGURE 3Specificity and sensitivity of TRPM4 currents for PI(4,5)P2. mTRPM4 currents were evoked in inside-out patches (Vm = -80 mV) by exposure to 100 μm cytoplasmic Ca2+. A, TRPM4 current is recovered following rundown by PI(4,5)P2 but not by 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (DOG) or arachidonic acid (AA). B, summary of experiments testing the ability of a range of second messengers and phosphatidylinositols to recover the TRPM4 current. Data were obtained from experiments as in A and were normalized to the response to PI(4,5)P2 using the equation: relative I = (I[x] - I(Ca2+))/(I[10 μm PI(4,5)P2] - I(Ca2+)) where I(Ca2+) is the current that was evoked in response to Ca2+ after desensitization. All phosphatidylinositols were present at a concentration of 10 μm, and the responses were normalized to the response to 10 μm PI(4,5)P2.

Only patches in which the TRPM4 current decayed nearly completely were used in this analysis. Relative I was calculated as (I[x] - I(Ca2+))/(I[20 μm PI(4,5)P2] - I(Ca2+)) where I(Ca2+) is the current that was evoked in response to Ca2+ after desensitization.

The storage of information for behavioral purposes requires that changes in synaptic strength be maintained for periods that greatly exceed the half-life of activation or even the lifetime of the proteins that participate in this process. Several positive feedback mechanisms have been proposed to account for this long lasting effect, involving mainly kinases, phosphatases, and the protein synthesis machinery (1.Lisman J. Schulman H.

The regulation of dendritic protein synthesis seems to be largely independent of the cell soma, inasmuch as isolated synaptoneurosomes respond to short pulses of a mixture of glutamate and NMDA with an increase in general protein synthesis, which is accompanied by an increase in the levels of the CaMKII protein (3.Scheetz A.J.

Furthermore, BDNF as well as a D1/D5 dopaminergic agonist induce the expression in dendrites of a green fluorescent protein reporter whose coding sequence is flanked by the sequences encoding the 5′- and 3′-untranslated region of CaMKII mRNA, sequences known to control CaMKII mRNA translation (4.Aakalu G.

Neuron. 2005; 45: 765-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays an important role in the late phase of LTP; thus rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of TOR complex 1, prevents late phase LTP when applied during the induction phase (6.Cammallieri M. Lutjens R. Berton F. King A.R. Simpson C. Francesconi W. Sanna P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14368-14373Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). BDNF increases protein synthesis in neurons through activation of the mTOR/S6K pathway (7.Takei N. Kawamura M. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Nawa H. J. Biol.

Rev. 2003; 84: 87-136Crossref Scopus (1458) Google Scholar), responses that are inhibited by rapamycin (6.Cammallieri M. Lutjens R. Berton F. King A.R. Simpson C. Francesconi W. Sanna P.P. Proc.

Neurosc. 2002; 22: 3359-3365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TOR complex 1 controls the component of mRNA translation necessary for cell growth, presumably through the phosphorylation of its substrates, which include eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein and the p70S6 kinase (S6K). Thus, interference or deletion of S6K results in a marked decrease in cell size during development and in response to mitogen stimulation in culture (reviewed in Ref. 12.Hay N.A. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3484) Google Scholar). mTOR can regulate both translational initiation and elongation, the latter by promoting the inactivation of elongation factor 2 kinase (EF2 kinase, also known as CaMKIII). EF2 kinase phosphorylates EF2 at Thr52 in the GTP-binding domain and inhibits EF2-catalyzed mRNA transit through the ribosome (13.Browne G.J. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5360-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Whereas intracellular Ca2+ activates EF2 kinase (14.Marin P. Nastiuk K.L. Daniel N. Girault J.A. Czernik A.J. Glowinski J. Nairn A.C. Premont J. J. Neurosc. 1997; 17: 3445-3454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), activation of the mTOR/S6K as well as ERK/Rsk pathways phosphorylate and inhibit EF2 kinase, thereby promoting the elongation activity of EF2 (15.Wang X. Li W. Williams M. Terada N. Alessi D.R. Proud C.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4370-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Glutamatergic receptors are central to several activity-dependent alterations in synaptic strength that play a role in memory and learning. These receptors are also involved in the neuronal death that occurs in many chronic neurodegenerative disorders (16.Hardingham G.E. Bading H. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 81-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The factors that promote the physiological and pathological functions of the NMDA receptors are incompletely defined, but the intensity and duration of stimulation (17.Sutton G. Chandler L.J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) together with the synaptic versus extrasynaptic localization of the receptor (18.Hardingham G.E. Fukunaga Y. Bading H. Nat. Neurosc. 2002; 5: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar) are suggested as factors that can direct the response to one or the other outcome. Herein we characterize the effect of glutamatergic activation on the mTOR/S6K pathway in cultured mouse neurons and demonstrate that physiologic stimulation promotes mTOR activation independently of the NMDA receptor through a calcium/calmodulin signal controlled by voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels; by contrast, excitotoxic glutamatergic stimulation inhibits mTOR signaling. The “Materials and Methods” are provided in the supplemental material. A Short Glutamatergic Stimulus Induces the Activation of the S6K Pathway, whereas a Sustained Stimulus Is Inhibitory—Mimicking the physiological glutamatergic stimulus that occurs at a synapse is not a simple task, inasmuch as neurons in culture are very sensitive to supra-physiologic concentrations of, and/or inappropriately prolonged exposure to, glutamatergic agonists. For example, NMDA at 25 μm activates, whereas 100 μm inhibits, ERK signaling (19.Chandler L.J. Sutton G. Dorairaj N. Norwood D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2627-2636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and continuous exposure to glutamate for periods needed to study protein synthesis regulation, i.e. 30 min or more, leads to massive cell death (20.McDonald J.W. Silverstein F.S. Johnston M.V. Brain Res. 1988; 459: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In an effort to achieve a glutamatergic stimulation that mimics, as closely as possible, a physiologic stimulus, we employed a very short glutamatergic treatment protocol; this was accomplished by adding a mixture of glutamate (10 μm) and NMDA (50 μm) followed 5 s later by the addition of the NMDA receptor antagonist APV (120 μm). This treatment protocol is hereafter referred to as GNA. Whereas the GNA protocol resulted in an increase in the phosphorylation of S6K, S6, Akt, and ERK in cortical neurons when analyzed 30 min after application of the stimulus, the same concentrations of glutamate and NMDA applied without the addition of APV 5 s later led to a reduction in the phosphorylation of these proteins below the initial levels (Fig. 1A). The magnitude of the increase in the phosphorylation of S6K, Akt, and ERK induced by GNA (estimated by immunoblot) is comparable but slightly less than that elicited by BDNF (Fig. 1, B and C); however, the GNA-induced increase in S6 phosphorylation is only about half that elicited by BDNF (Fig. 1C). The very brief nature of the GNA stimulus biases toward underestimation and makes a quantitative comparison to BDNF unreliable. Stimulation of Synaptic Activity in Culture Activates the S6K Pathway— Neuronal cultures contain inhibitory interneurons that control basal neuronal activity through the activation of the GABAA receptor. Therefore, the inhibition of this receptor with bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist, together with 4-AP, a weak potassium channel blocker, is able to produce a selective increase in basal synaptic activity, i.e. activating receptors localized at synapses, without activating extrasynaptic receptors (18.Hardingham G.E. Fukunaga Y. Bading H. Nat. Neurosc. 2002; 5: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). The elaboration of these inhibitory GABAergic interneurons requires considerable maturation of primary neuronal cultures (21.Kato-Negishi M. Muramoto K. Kawahara M. Kuroda Y. Ichikawa M. Brain Res. 2004; 152: 99-108Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus whereas a vigorous response to GNA is evident in cultures stimulated 6 days after plating/attachment, the response to GNA is fully attenuated by 12 days in culture. In contrast, bicuculline (50 μm) plus 4-aminopyridine (2.5 μm) (hereafter called BAP), which elicits little or no response in 6-day cultures, produces a robust activation of p70S6 kinase and ERK when applied to neurons after twelve days in culture. These results reflect the maturation of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons and/or glutamatergic synapses (22.Lesuisse C. Martin L.J. J. Neurobiol. 2002; 51: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and indicate that synaptic stimulation is a very strong activator of signaling pathways leading to the S6K and ERK (Fig. 1, D and E). In contrast to BAP, which selectively disinhibits receptors localized at synapses, bath application of glutamate activates both synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors. Activation of extrasynaptic glutamatergic receptors was shown previously to block the induction of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation by BAP (18.Hardingham G.E. Fukunaga Y. Bading H. Nat. Neurosc. 2002; 5: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). Herein we show that when neurons, 12 days in culture, are treated with glutamate (100 μm) after a 30-min pretreatment with BAP, the BAP-induced phosphorylation of S6 is reduced by 10 min and abolished after 30min. Thus activation of extrasynaptic glutamate receptors, in a dominant fashion, blocks the activation of the mTOR/S6K pathway induced by synaptic activation (Fig. 1F). Glutamtergic Stimulation of the mTOR Pathway Requires Calcium Entry through L-type Voltage-dependent Calcium Channels—We sought to characterize the pathway responsible for glutamatergic activation of mTOR signaling. Activation of p70S6 kinase by receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g. BDNF/TrkB) requires the activation of Type 1 PI3K and is ultimately mediated by the sequential phosphorylation of S6 kinase by the rapamycin-sensitive TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and the kinase PDK1; thus BDNF activation of the mTOR pathway to p70S6K is inhibited by the PI3K inhibitors, Ly294002 or wortmannin, and by the TORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin (7.Takei N. Kawamura M. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Nawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42818-42825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 8.Takei N. Inamura N. Kawamura M. Namba H. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Nawa H. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9760-9769Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Similarly, GNA- and BAP-stimulated phosphorylation of p70S6K and S6 is strongly inhibited by Ly294002 or wortmannin and by rapamycin (Fig. 2, A and B). The PI3K inhibitor also prevents the GNA phosphorylation of Akt (Thr473) and of the Akt substrate, GSK3β(Ser9) (Fig. 2A); the latter are, however, resistant to rapamycin. Neither Ly294002 nor rapamycin has any significant effect on BAP (Fig. 2A) or GNA (data not shown) activation of ERK (Fig. 2B). Thus, as with BDNF, PI3K is necessary for GNA/BAP activation of Akt and p70S6 kinase, and the latter also requires the TORC1, whereas activation of ERK is presumably driven by Ras-GTP through a PI3K-independent mechanism. As regards the GNA/BAP responsive elements further upstream, APV, a potent and selective inhibitor of the ionotropic NMDA receptor, strongly suppresses BAP (Fig. 2B) and GNA (data not shown) activation of ERK. Surprisingly, however, APV does not alter GNA or BAP activation of the mTOR pathway (Fig. 2, B–D). Glutamatergic stimulation of the mTOR pathway does require Ca2+/calmodulin, inasmuch as blockade of calmodulin with calmidazolium (Fig. 2, A–C) or inhibition of CaMKII with KN93 (Fig. 2, B and C) each completely inhibits the activation of S6K and the phosphorylation of S6. BDNF-stimulated phosphorylation of S6K is also inhibited by both KN93 and by calmidozolium (Fig. 2C). Nifedipine, an inhibitor of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (L-VDCC), strongly inhibits both S6 and ERK phosphorylation induced by GNA or BAP (Fig. 2, B and D) but not by BDNF (Fig. 2D), which can mobilize intracellular calcium stores by activation of phospholipase C. Direct activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, achieved by depolarization of neurons with KCl (60 mm for 30 min), induces a strong increase in the phosphorylation of S6, in a mechanism blocked by calmidazolium, the L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blockers nifedipine and nimodipine as well as by KN93 (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that the GNA and BAP glutamatergic stimulation protocols promote activation of the mTOR/S6K pathway by an NMDA receptor-independent activation of L-VDCC; in contrast, BDNF signaling to CaMKII is completely independent of both NMDA receptor as well as L-VDCC. Elongation Factor 2 Phosphorylation Is Inhibited by Depolarization or Synaptic Stimulation but Increased by Extrasynaptic Glutamatergic Stimulation—EF2 facilitates peptide chain elongation and can be negatively regulated by EF2 kinase (EF2K). The latter is activated by Ca2+/calmodulin and inhibited by both the ERK and the mTOR pathways, through direct phosphorylation of EF2K in its calmodulin-binding domain by either Rsk or p70S6 kinase, respectively. Treatment of neurons with calmidazolium completely abolishes phosphorylation of EF2 (Fig. 3A), presumably by direct inhibition of EF2K, whereas the relatively selective CaMKII inhibitor KN93 increases the phosphorylation of EF2 in the presence of GNA and BDNF (Fig. 3A), presumably reflecting the ability of KN93 to abolish activation of ERK and mTOR signaling (Fig. 2, B, C, and E); inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin also increases the phosphorylation of EF2 (data not shown). Neurotropic and physiological glutamatergic stimulation leads to the increase in intracellular Ca2+ but also results in an increase in protein synthesis; this suggests that the activation of ERK and S6K accompanying such stimuli is dominant in the regulation of EF2. Consistent with this view, BDNF gives a very robust activation of ERK paralleled by a profound inhibition of EF2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). BAP- and KCl-induced depolarization each cause a progressive decrease in the phosphorylation of EF2, which, compared with BDNF, is relatively slow in onset, perhaps due to the less robust activation of ERK. In contrast to BAP and KCl, the continuous presence of glutamate plus NMDA without the addition of APV (GluNMDA), which suppresses ERK and mTOR signaling, results in a progressive increase in EF2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Thus, despite the ability of all these stimuli to incease intracellular Ca2+, the Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of EF2 is inhibited if there is concomitant activation of ERK/Rsk and/or mTOR/p70S6 kinase. Catecholamines Enhance GNA-stimulated S6 Phosphorylation—Activation of D1/D5 dopaminergic receptors was recently shown to increase protein synthesis in dendrites of hippocampal neurons (5.Smith W.B. Starck S.R. Roberts R.W. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 2005; 45: 765-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Dopaminergic and NMDA receptors interact directly and dopaminergic receptor activation protects neurons from NMDA-induced excitotoxicity; this protection is prevented by a PI3K inhibitor (23.Lee F.J.S. Xue S. Pei L. Vukusic B. Chery N. Wang Y. Wang Y.T. Niznik H.B. Yu X. Liu F. Cell. 2002; 111: 219-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). To assess whether there is an interaction between the glutamatergic and dopaminergic activated pathways in the regulation of the mTOR/S6K pathway, neurons were treated with dopamine, resulting in a small, statistically insignificant increase in the phosphorylation of S6. In contrast to the borderline stimulation by dopamine alone, the concomitant presence of dopamine and GNA produces a further increase in the phosphorylation of S6 when compared with that elicited by GNA alone (Fig. 4, A and B). An augmentation of GNA-stimulated S6 phosphorylation is even more clear-cut with another catecholamine, norepinephrine (NE) (Fig. 4, A and B), which significantly stimulates S6 phosphorylation by itself and when present with GNA promotes a further increase in S6 phosphorylation that is significantly greater than that elicited by GNA alone. The response of ERK to dopamine and NE alone is similar to that seen with S6 phosphorylation; however, ERK activation in response to GNA is not further increased by the presence of NE or dopamine (Fig. 4C). The mTOR/S6K pathway controls the component of protein synthesis that is particularly important for cell growth as well as for neuronal plasticity, inasmuch as the late phase of LTP is inhibited comparably by inhibitors of overall protein synthesis and by rapamycin. Because the glutamatergic system is a fundamental player in synaptic plasticity, we investigated the regulation of the mTOR/S6K pathway using stimulation protocols designed to mimic the plasticity-inducing stimulation that occurs in the intact brain. Previous studies using hippocampal slices (24.English J.D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24329-24332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) showed that ERK is activated by LTP-inducing stimulation, whereas excessive NMDA receptor stimulation inactivates this kinase (19.Chandler L.J. Sutton G. Dorairaj N. Norwood D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2627-2636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Similarly, we find that short and long exposures to glutamatergic stimulation produce, respectively, stimulatory and inhibitory effects on S6K, S6, Akt, and ERK phosphorylation, reinforcing the importance of a short pulse of glutamatergic stimulation for the activation of these pathways. Thus, despite the short duration between agonist and antagonist addition, GNA appears to provide a bona fide physiologic glutamatergic stimulation. The slow development in culture of inhibitory postsynaptic GABAergic interneurons enables the selective stimulation of endogenous synapses, through inhibition of GABAA receptor; such a maneuver (i.e. BAP) also activates the S6K and ERK pathways (Fig. 1D). As with GNA, sustained and generalized glutamatergic stimulation generates a dominant inhibition over BAP stimulation. A third illustration of this difference between physiologic and excitotoxic stimulation is seen in the phosphorylation of EF2; as shown previously (14.Marin P. Nastiuk K.L. Daniel N. Girault J.A. Czernik A.J. Glowinski J. Nairn A.C. Premont J. J. Neurosc. 1997; 17: 3445-3454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), supraphysiologic glutamatergic stimulation, which suppresses ERK and S6K activity, increases EF2 phosphorylation. In contrast, physiologic glutamatergic stimulation by BAP and GNA results in a decrease in phosphorylation of EF2. Thus although all require a Ca2+ signal, the mTOR/S6K and/or ERK/Rsk pathways are dominant to the EF2K pathway. The dependence of glutamatergic S6K activation on PI3k and the rapamycin-sensitive TORC1, as seen with BDNF stimulation of neurons (7.Takei N. Kawamura M. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Nawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42818-42825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), is not surprising. More unexpected is the finding that activation of the S6K pathway by GNA and BAP is strongly inhibited by L-VDCC blockers but is unaffected by the NMDA receptor antagonist APV (Fig. 2, B–D) or by the PLC inhibitor U73122 (data not shown). Thus the L-VDCC are indispensable for activation of the mTOR/S6K pathway in neurons by glutamatergic stimulation, by endogenous synaptic stimulation as well as by KCl-induced depolarization. Glutamatergic or synaptic stimulation can cause depolarization through activation of AMPA receptors and thereby activate the L-VDCC (25.Malinow R. Malenka R.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 103-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (2078) Google Scholar). Synaptic NMDA receptors, although critical for BAP-induced ERK activation, do not participate in BAP activation of the mTOR/S6K pathway. These results illustrate that Ca2+ entry through postsynaptic NMDA receptors and l-type VDCC contributes to different postsynaptic pools of Ca2+, in that the signal transduction pathways engaged by these two Ca2+ entry pathways differ, at least in part. Although both components are engaged during most protocols productive of LTP, earlier work has indicated that the two pathways can be recruited differentially by different patterns of electrical stimulation (26.Morgan S.L. Coussens C.M. Teyler T.J. Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2001; 76: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Moreover, the selective activation of Ca2+ entry by one or the other of these two pathways can each generate LTP responses in vitro that are distinct in their sensitivity to various protein kinase inhibitors (27.Cavus I. Teyler T. J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 76: 3038-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and when engaged selectively in vivo, these two pathways have distinguishable effects in a test of spatial memory, with inhibition of L-VDCC impairing the retention but not the acquisition of a learned task (28.Woodside B.L. Borroni A.M. Hammonds M.D. Teyler T.J. Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2004; 81: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Catecholaminergic neurons are concentrated in specific brain areas, such as substantia nigra in the case of dopaminergic neurons and locus coeruleus for norepinephrine neurons. Axons sprouting from these structures irrigate virtually all brain areas modulating the activity in these regions (29.Goridis C. Rohrer H. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 531-541Crossref Scopus (292) Google Scholar). It is believed that catecholamines are key regulators of mood and thus are responsible for the emotional background of memories (30.McGaugh J.L. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 456-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The ability of concomitant glutamatergic and catecholaminergic stimulation to enhance glutamatergic S6 phosphorylation is consistent with a variety of previous reports describing mutual reinforcement between these two synaptic inputs. Dopamine and NE affect synaptic potentiation, with dopamine alone or agonists of D1/D5 dopamine receptors inducing a slow, protein synthesis-dependent, synaptic potentiation in hippocampal slice that requires glutamatergic activation of NMDA receptors (31.Huang Y.Y. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2446-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Norepinephrine is also known to modulate LTP, restoring the LTP-inducing potency of high frequency stimulation in older animals (32.Izumi Y. Zorumski C.R. Synapse. 1999; 31: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Activation of D1/D5 receptors lead to an increase in protein synthesis, in an mTOR-dependent way. Moreover, NMDA receptor activity is required for the dopamine agonist-induced increase in surface GluR and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (5.Smith W.B. Starck S.R. Roberts R.W. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 2005; 45: 765-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), indicating the importance of the signaling of the glutamatergic and dopaminergic receptors toward protein synthesis. Thus, the additive effect of GNA with dopamine/norepinephrine on activation of the mTOR/S6K pathway suggests that this phenomenon may account in part for the synergistic regulation of protein-synthesis dependent synaptic plasticity. In conclusion, glutamatergic or synaptic stimulations designed to mimic physiological stimuli increase the activation of S6K and the phosphorylation of S6 in a VDCC-, Ca2+-calmodulin-, CaMKII-, and PI3K-dependent mechanism, and this increase is further augmented by co-stimulation with catecholamines. In contrast, excitotoxic glutamatergic stimulation dominantly inhibits the mTOR/S6K pathway. Download .pdf (.02 MB) Help with pdf files"

Autophagy is a process that involves the bulk degradation of cytoplasmic components by the lysosomal/vacuolar system (1Baba M. Takeshige K. Baba N. Ohsumi Y. J.

Science. 2004; 306: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). In the process of autophagy, a double-membrane structure called an autophagosome sequesters a portion of the cytoplasm and fuses with the lysosome/vacuole to deliver its contents into the organelle lumen. Genetic approaches in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (4Klionsky D.J. Cregg J.M. Dunn Jr., W.A. Emr S.D. Sakai Y. Sandoval I.V. Sibirny A. Subramani S. Thumm M. Veenhuis M. Ohsumi Y. Dev.

Although the conjugation mechanism adopted by the Atg8 system is similar to those of other ubiquitin-like conjugation systems, the Atg8 system has several unique features. The most outstanding feature is that the target for Atg8 is a lipid, not a protein. Therefore, in contrast to other deconjugating enzymes, which function to deconjugate soluble proteins, Atg4 has to deconjugate Atg8-PE, which is localized in the membranes. Another unique feature is that in addition to the ubiquitin-fold region, Atg8 has two α-helices at its N terminus. These helices have been elucidated by structural studies of mammalian homologs (7Sugawara K. Suzuki N.N. Fujioka Y. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F.

Recent investigations have suggested that the molecular machinery of autophagosome formation is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to higher eukaryotes (4Klionsky D.J. Cregg J.M. Dunn Jr., W.A.

In mammals, an Atg8-like conjugation system, called the LC3 (microtubule-associated protein light chain 3) system, has been shown to exist (11Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T.

LC3, the first identified mammalian homolog of Atg8, was originally found as a light chain of microtubule-associated proteins 1A and 1B in the rat brain (14Mann S.S. Hammarback J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11492-11497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like the Atg8 system in yeast, the C-terminal region of LC3 is cleaved by mammalian Atg4 (mAtg4) homologs (11Kabeya Y.

After activation by mammalian Atg7 (mAtg7) and Atg3 (mAtg3) homologs (12Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol.

Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Oshitani-Okamoto S. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2805-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar), as in the Atg8 system. Because LC3-II is localized in the autophagosomal membrane, it is now widely used as a probe to monitor autophagosomes and autophagy activity in mammalian systems (11Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5510) Google Scholar). In addition to LC3, three mammalian Atg8 homologs are identified: Golgi-associated ATPase enhancer of 16 kDa (GATE-16) (18Legesse-Miller A. Sagiv Y. Porat A. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3105-3109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), GABAA receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) (19Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W.

However, among these homologs LC3 is most abundant in autophagosomal membranes, indicating the crucial role of LC3 in mammalian autophagy. Thus far, four human homologs of yeast Atg4 have been reported: HsAtg4A/autophagin-2, HsAtg4B/autophagin-1, autophagin-3, and autophagin-4 (6Kirisako T. Ichimura Y. Okada H. Kabeya Y. Mizushima N.

Chem. 2003; 278: 14053-14058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), whereas HsAtg4B has a broad specificity for mammalian Atg8 homologs (GATE-16, GABARAP, and LC3) (15Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Oshitani-Okamoto S. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2805-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 17Tanida I. Sou Y.S. Ezaki J. Minematsu-Ikeguchi N. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36268-36276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Among human Atg4 homologs, HsAtg4B is the sole enzyme reported to efficiently cleave LC3 (15Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Oshitani-Okamoto S. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2805-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Thus HsAtg4B is considered to play an important role in mammalian autophagy by processing and deconjugating LC3. Herein, we report the crystal structure of HsAtg4B at 1.9-Å resolution. The structure and structure-based mutagenesis studies provide the molecular basis for the specificity and catalysis of HsAtg4B. Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—The region coding the full length of HsAtg4B was inserted into the pGEX6p vector (Amersham Biosciences), and HsAtg4B was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 cells. The GST-fused protein was first purified using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences) followed by excision of GST from the protein with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences). Further purification was performed using Resource Q followed by Superdex 75 columns (Amersham Biosciences). The purified protein was concentrated to 7 mg ml-1 in 0.15 m NaCl with 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4 and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Crystallization trials were performed with the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method at 293 K. HsAtg4B was crystallized with a reservoir solution consisting of 0.2 m NaH2PO4, 0.8 m K2HPO4, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.1 m appropriate buffer at a broad range of pH 5.6 to 10.0. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group C2221, with unit cell parameters of a = 51.9, b = 88.3, c = 160.1 Å. The selenomethionine derivative was expressed in E. coli, B834 (DE3) using an amino acid medium (23LeMaster D.M. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7263-7268Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) containing selenomethionine instead of methionine and was crystallized under the same conditions as those for native crystals. Data Collection—Crystals were immersed in a reservoir solution supplemented with 16% glycerol for several seconds and then flash-cooled and maintained under nitrogen gas at 90 K during data collection. All diffraction data were collected on the ADSC Quantum 315 charge-coupled device detector using the SPring-8 beamline BL41XU. Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) data were collected from a single crystal of selenomethionine-substituted HsAtg4B at three wavelengths. Each data set was independently integrated, scaled, and processed using the HKL2000 program suite (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

All selenium sites with the exception of the N-terminal Met were found and refined, and the initial phases were calculated using the programs SOLVE and RESOLVE (25Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). About 60% of the residues were automatically modeled as a polyalanine chain by RESOLVE. Further model construction was performed manually using the molecular modeling program O (26Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar), and the refinement was performed using the crystallography and NMR system program (27Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The refinement statistics are summarized in TABLE ONE. The coordinates and structure factors of HsAtg4B have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code 2CY7). In Vitro Cleavage Assay—For the in vitro cleavage assay, two kinds of rat LC3 (homolog of human LC3B) were constructed with different tags fused to the C-terminal Gly-120. One consisted of a 15-amino acid sequence, GSPEFPGRLHHHHHH, which originated from the pGEX vector and a hexahistidine tag (this construct is called LC3-His); the other was the GST tag (this construct is called LC3-GST). Single mutant LC3s (Q116A and F119A) were prepared by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis and sequenced to confirm their identities. LC3-His and LC3-(1–115) were inserted into the pGEX6p vector, whereas LC3-GST was inserted into the pET11a vector (Novagen). They were expressed in E. coli and purified on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. Each construct was concentrated to 1 mg/ml (LC3-His and LC3-GST) or 3 mg/ml (LC3-(1–115)) in the reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The 9-mer peptide QETFGTALA, which corresponds to amino acids 116–124 of unprocessed LC3, was purchased from Sigma Genosys. Constructs of various mutant HsAtg4Bs were also prepared by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis and sequenced to confirm their identities. The mutant HsAtg4Bs were expressed and purified according to the same procedure described for wild-type HsAtg4B above. LC3-His, LC3-GST, and mutant LC3s (1 mg/ml) fused to GST were mixed with 0.3, 0.03, or 0.003 mg/ml HsAtg4B at a volume ratio of 1:1 and incubated at 293 K for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The 9-mer peptide (1 mg/ml) was mixed with 3 mg/ml HsAtg4B or its deletion mutant Δ(259–262) with or without 3 mg/ml LC3 (1–115) and incubated at 293 K for 6 h. The reaction solutions were applied to a Resource RPC column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid solution and eluted using a gradient of 0–80% CH3CN with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid solution. For mutational analyses using mutant HsAtg4Bs, wild-type and mutant HsAtg4Bs (0.1 mg/ml) in reaction buffer were mixed with LC3-GST (1 mg/ml) at a volume ratio of 1:1. After 10 min at 293 K, the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Overall Structure of HsAtg4B—The crystal structure of HsAtg4B was refined against 1.9-Å data to an R-factor of 0.215 and a free R-factor of 0.247. The region corresponding to amino acids 5–377 was modeled along with 202 water molecules. All non-glycine residues are within the most favored or additional allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (28Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The four N-terminal residues, 16 C-terminal residues, and four loop regions corresponding to residues 190–216, 288–290, 343–346, and 356–361 lacked defined electron density and were omitted from the model (Fig. 1). The overall structure of HsAtg4B consists of an α/β-fold with nine α-helices and 13 β-strands. It is organized around a central antiparallel β-sheet composed of strands β6, β7, β8, β9, β11, and β12. In addition to the six strands, strand β4 forms a parallel sheet with β6, and strands β1 and β2 form an antiparallel β-sheet with β8. Four α-helices (F–I) and two β-strands (β5 and β13) are located on one side of the central β-sheet, whereas five α-helices (A–E) and two β-strands (β3 and β10) are located on the other side. HsAtg4B Has a Papain-like Fold—Comparison of the HsAtg4B structure with the Protein Data Bank data base using the DALI search engine (29Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar) revealed that HsAtg4B has high structural similarity to papain family cysteine proteases as well as deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B shows the topology of the proteins shown in Fig. 2A. α-Helices and β-strands of HsAtg4B observed in common with those of papain are colored red and cyan, respectively. These conserved secondary elements are designated after the nomenclature used for those of HsAtg4B. Among these proteins, HsAtg4B shows the highest structural similarity to papain and its homologous proteases. The root mean square deviation between HsAtg4B and papain (Protein Data Bank code 1PE6) is 3.4 Å for 156 Cα atoms. Both HsAtg4B and papain have six antiparallel central strands (β6, β12, β7, β8, β9, and β11 of HsAtg4B) and four α-helices (B, C, E, G of HsAtg4B) in the same order. Among the deconjugating enzymes, HsAtg4B shows the most structural similarity to herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP) (Protein Data Bank code 1NBF), a UBP (ubiquitin-specific processing protease) family protease with a root mean square deviation of 4.0 Å for 148 Cα atoms. HAUSP also has six antiparallel central strands and α-helices B and E in the same order. However, the other helices are not superimposed. HsAtg4B lacks a detectable sequence homology with either papain or HAUSP (10 and 7% identity for 156 and 148 superimposed residues, respectively). Nevertheless, the topologies are very similar. The topology of other deconjugating enzymes differs more significantly. For ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs), helix B (containing the catalytic cysteine) is inserted between β7 and β8 (30Johnston S.C. Larsen C.N. Cook W.J. Wilkinson K.D. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3787-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). For ubiquitin-like proteases (ULPs), the topology, including the central β-sheet, differs significantly (31Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Deconjugating enzymes have functional differences. UBP family proteases deconjugate ubiquitin from proteins, whereas UCH family proteases deconjugate ubiquitin from small adducts, and ULP family proteases deconjugate ubiquitin-like proteins, such as SUMO or NEDD8, from proteins (32Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the Atg4 family proteases deconjugate Atg8 family proteins from a small adduct, PE. Based on these facts and no sequence homology with other deconjugating enzymes, Atg4 family proteases have been considered the most distinct member among deconjugating enzymes. However, the structure of HsAtg4B is significantly similar to that of the UBP family protease, and surprisingly, the structural similarity between HsAtg4B and the UBP family protease is higher than that between the two DUB families, UBPs and UCHs, or UBPs and ULPs. A Small Domain Unique to HsAtg4B—Compared with papain, HsAtg4B has an inserted region composed of the α-helices F, H, and I and the β-strands 5 and 13 (enclosed by broken lines in Fig. 2A). HAUSP also has an inserted region, positionally similar to that of HsAtg4B, although its shape and size are different (Fig. 2). The inserted region of HAUSP, designated as the fingers domain (33Hu M. Li P. Li M. Li W. Yao T. Wu J.W. Gu W. Cohen R.E. Shi Y. Cell. 2002; 11: 1041-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (493) Google Scholar), consists of a large β-sheet and protrudes from the papain fold region as far as 30 Å. The fingers domain is unique to UBP family proteases and is responsible for the recognition of ubiquitin (33Hu M. Li P. Li M. Li W. Yao T. Wu J.W. Gu W. Cohen R.E. Shi Y. Cell. 2002; 11: 1041-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Compared with the fingers domain of HAUSP, the inserted region of HsAtg4B is appreciably shorter; therefore, it is called the short fingers domain. UCHs and ULPs do not have an inserted domain (Fig. 2). In addition to the domain insertion, HsAtg4B and HAUSP have an insertion of strand β4 in common, near the inserted domain that is parallel to β6 of the central sheet (Fig. 2B). Catalytic Residues—Fig. 3A shows the active site structure of HsAtg4B. The Nϵ2 atom of His-280 is 3.4 Å from the Sγ atom of Cys-74, and the Nδ1 atom of His-280 is 2.6 Å from the Oδ1 atom of Asp-278. This is the geometry observed in the canonical catalytic triad of cysteine proteases. These three residues are strictly conserved among Atg4 homologs (22Marino G. Uria J.A. Puente X.S. Quesada V. Bordallo J. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3671-3678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), suggesting that these are the catalytic triad of HsAtg4B. Fig. 3B shows the superimposition of the catalytic residues of HAUSP (PDB code 1NBF), papain (PDB code 1PE6), UCH-L3 (PDB code 1UCH), and Ulp1 (PDB code 1EUV) on those of HsAtg4B. Here, the structure of the HAUSP-ubiquitin aldehyde complex was used for superimposition because the catalytic triad of HAUSP is properly aligned only when it forms a complex with its substrate (33Hu M. Li P. Li M. Li W. Yao T. Wu J.W. Gu W. Cohen R.E. Shi Y. Cell. 2002; 11: 1041-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Cys-74 and Asp-278 of HsAtg4B are superimposed on the nucleophilic cysteine and the Asp/Asn residue comprising the catalytic triad of cysteine proteases, respectively (Fig. 3B). Cys-74 is located at the N terminus of helix B, and Asp-278 is located at the C terminus of β9. Both of these positions are conserved among papain and DUBs (Fig. 2B). In contrast, although the side chain of His-280 of HsAtg4B can be superimposed on that of the general base histidine of papain and DUBs, its main-chain location is different. His-280 of HsAtg4B is located at a loop between β9 and β11, whereas the general base histidine of papain and DUBs is located at the N terminus of the strand equivalent to β8 of HsAtg4B (Figs. 2B and 3B). Although ULP family proteases have a different topology, their catalytic triad residues are located in the same geometry as those of both papain and DUBs (Figs. 2B and 3B). Thus the different location of the histidine residue is a unique feature of Atg4 family proteases. In addition to the catalytic triad, cysteine proteases have a conserved Asn/Gln residue that participates in the formation of the oxianion hole crucial for catalysis: Gln-19 for papain, Asn-218 for HAUSP, Gln-89 for UCH-L3, and Gln-574 for Ulp1. Atg4 family proteases also have a conserved Gln residue near the nucleophilic cysteine sequence (Gln-80 for HsAtg4B) that was suggested to be a component of the oxianion hole (22Marino G. Uria J.A. Puente X.S. Quesada V. Bordallo J. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3671-3678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, a conserved Tyr residue (Tyr-54), not Gln-80, is superimposed on these Asn/Gln residues (Figs. 2B and 3B), and Gln-80 is located distally. This is another unique feature of Atg4 family proteases. Conformational Changes Prerequisite for Catalysis—Fig. 3C shows the surface representation of HsAtg4B. Residues conserved among four human Atg4 homologs and yeast Atg4 are colored green, whereas catalytic triad residues are colored red. The green region is localized near the catalytic triad (Fig. 3C), suggesting the importance of the region for substrate recognition. There is a concave surface at the left side of the green region. This surface consists of the short fingers domain, strand β4, and helix E and its N-terminal loop (Fig. 3D). HAUSP also has a similar concave surface consisting of the fingers domain, strand β4, helix E, and other regions (Fig. 2), where the core region of ubiquitin aldehyde binds (33Hu M. Li P. Li M. Li W. Yao T. Wu J.W. Gu W. Cohen R.E. Shi Y. Cell. 2002; 11: 1041-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Therefore, the concave surface of HsAtg4B is the putative binding site for the LC3 core. In contrast,"

Although it has been shown that both Rio1 and Rio2 have the enzymatic activity of kinases and are capable of autophosphorylation, the biological substrates of RIO proteins and their full biological role still remain to be discovered. The RIO family of proteins was first characterized only 8 years ago, based on the studies of a RIO1 (right open reading frame) gene, expressed constitutively at a low level in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1Angermayr M. Bandlow W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31630-31635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Subsequent detailed analyses of sequence data bases identified many genes that contain homologs of a kinase-like domain found in yeast Rio1 (2Leonard C.J. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 1038-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 3Angermayr M. Roidl A. Bandlow W. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 4Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6240) Google Scholar). A distinct Rio2 protein was subsequently identified in yeast (5Geerlings T.H. Faber A.W. Bister M.D. Vos J.C. Raue H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22537-22545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although the RIO domain contains a kinase signature motif, it otherwise exhibits little sequence similarity with eukaryotic protein kinases (ePKs) 2The abbreviations used are: ePKeukaryotic protein kinaseMBPmyelin basic proteinPKAcAMP-dependent protein kinaseAMPPNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate 2The abbreviations used are: ePKeukaryotic protein kinaseMBPmyelin basic proteinPKAcAMP-dependent protein kinaseAMPPNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate (3Angermayr M. Roidl A. Bandlow W. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and thus was classified as an atypical protein kinase (4Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6240) Google Scholar). Representatives of the RIO family are present in organisms varying from Archaea to humans. All such organisms contain at least two such proteins, one that is more similar to yeast Rio1 and another with a slightly different RIO domain and a conserved N-terminal domain, homologous to yeast Rio2. Eventually, a third group named Rio3 was described, which is more similar to Rio1 but also contains a conserved N-terminal domain different than that of Rio2 (4Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6240) Google Scholar). Members of the Rio3 subfamily have been found thus far only in multicellular eukaryotes. As shown in Fig. 1 each RIO subfamily is distinguished by specific sequence variations in the RIO kinase domains as well as by the presence of subfamily-specific, conserved N-terminal sequences. It was also reported that RIO kinases are present in a number of species of eubacteria with only a single representative per organism (2Leonard C.J. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 1038-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 6Krupa A. Srinivasan N. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1580-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Examination of their sequences reveals that the bacterial RIO kinases are most similar to Rio1 in the N-terminal half and more similar to Rio2 in the C-terminal half of the kinase domain (Fig. 1). Thus it appears that the bacterial RIO kinases are related to both Rio1 and Rio2 enzymes and may represent the remnants of a common progenitor of the two subfamilies. This is interesting in view of the report that the Kdo lipid kinases bear significant homology to the bacterial RIO kinases (6Krupa A. Srinivasan N. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1580-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and thus the RIO kinases may represent the evolutionary link between bacterial lipid kinases and ePKs. eukaryotic protein kinase myelin basic protein cAMP-dependent protein kinase adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate eukaryotic protein kinase myelin basic protein cAMP-dependent protein kinase adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate The founding member of the RIO family, Rio1 (sometimes also called Rrp10p for ribosomal RNA processing number 10 (7Vanrobays E.

In yeast cells deprived of Rio1, cell cycle arrest occurs in G1 or mitosis, indicating that Rio1 activity is required for entry into S phase and exit from mitosis (3Angermayr M. Roidl A. Bandlow W. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition, both yeast Rio1 and Rio2 were identified as non-ribosomal factors necessary for late 18 S rRNA processing (5Geerlings T.H. Faber A.W. Bister M.D. Vos J.C. Raue H.A. J. Biol.

It has been demonstrated that the yeast RIO proteins are capable of serine phosphorylation in vitro, and conserved kinase catalytic residues are required for their in vivo function (5Geerlings T.H.

The cellular localization of Rio1 and Rio2 in yeast was investigated using green fluorescent protein-labeled proteins. Both Rio1 and Rio2 shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm. The presence of green fluorescent protein-tagged Rio2 was detected in both compartments (9Vanrobays E. Gelugne J.P. Gleizes P.E. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2083-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), but TAP-Rio2 was seen only in the nucleus (5Geerlings T.H. Faber A.W. Bister M.D. Vos J.C. Raue H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22537-22545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). By contrast, Rio1 was seen solely in the cytoplasmic fraction (7Vanrobays E. Gleizes P.E.

Caizergues-Ferrer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2083-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The biological activities of the two proteins do not complement each other and they do not co-purify although both are associating with the same fractions that contain 20 S pre-RNA (9Vanrobays E. Gelugne J.P. Gleizes P.E. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2083-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It was also shown that Rio2 is a component of the 43 S pre-ribosomal subunit (10Schafer T. Strauss D. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Hurt E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1370-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Several RIO proteins have been expressed in Escherichia coli, and their enzymatic properties were characterized. Yeast Rio1 was cloned and expressed with a N-terminal His6 tag (11Angermayr M. Bandlow W. FEBS Lett. 2002; 524: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The protein was shown to be an active kinase, although the established substrates such as α-casein, histones H1 and H2A, enolase, or myelin basic protein (MBP) were found to be phosphorylated very poorly. However, purified Rio1 showed strong ATP-dependent autophosphorylation, although the dephosphorylated enzyme was reported to be nearly inactive (11Angermayr M. Bandlow W. FEBS Lett. 2002; 524: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A. fulgidus Rio1 was expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein containing the N-terminal His6 tag followed by a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site; the tag was subsequently removed during protein purification. The enzyme is capable of autophosphorylation on Ser-108 and can also phosphorylate MBP and histone H1. However, neither the absolute levels of enzymatic activity nor reaction kinetics of A. fulgidus Rio1 were investigated in detail. A mutant in which the putative catalytic residue Asp-196 was changed to alanine was only marginally active, whereas the S108A mutant that lacked the autophosphorylation site retained its enzymatic activity (12LaRonde-LeBlanc N. Guszczynski T. Copeland T. Wlodawer A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3698-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Yeast Rio2 was expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase at its N terminus, and its activity was assayed in this form. The enzyme was capable of autophosphorylation in the presence of both Mg2+ and Mn2+ ions, although the latter ion was necessary for phosphorylation of MBP and increased the efficiency of autophosphorylation. A D229A mutant was shown to be marginally active, whereas the H227F mutant retained full activity (5Geerlings T.H. Faber A.W. Bister M.D. Vos J.C. Raue H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22537-22545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A. fulgidus Rio2 with its native N terminus was expressed in the same way as Rio1 from that organism (13LaRonde-LeBlanc N. Wlodawer A. Structure. 2004; 12: 1585-1594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and it was also shown to be active in an autophosphorylation assay, although at a level much lower than that of Rio1. The level of autophosphorylation was similar in the presence of either Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions. The site of autophosphorylation was determined to be Ser-128. No mutants of this protein have been studied to date. A Rio1 homolog from Nicotiana tabacum (NtRIO) has been expressed in E. coli as a cleavable glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (14Yoshioka K. Matsushita Y. Kasahara M. Konagaya K. Nyunoya H. Mol. Cells. 2004; 17: 223-229PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length protein contained 562 amino acids, and its RIO domain (residues 144–380) exhibited 33% identity with S. cerevisiae Rio1. NtRIO is also capable of autophosphorylation, although the level of activity was 100-fold higher in the presence of the recombinant tobacco casein kinase CK2, either due to enhanced autophosphorylation or (more likely) through phosphorylation by CK2. The site(s) of autophosphorylation was not determined. Determination of the crystal structures of A. fulgidus Rio2 and Rio1 made detailed structural characterization of each subfamily possible (12LaRonde-LeBlanc N. Guszczynski T. Copeland T. Wlodawer A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3698-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13LaRonde-LeBlanc N. Wlodawer A. Structure. 2004; 12: 1585-1594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The overall fold of the kinase domain of these two enzymes is very similar (Fig. 2, A and B), although some significant local differences between the two proteins result in a root mean square deviation of 1.4 Å. As seen in both structures, the consensus RIO domain consists of an N-lobe comprised of a twisted β-sheet (β1–β6) and a long α-helix (αC) that closes the back of the ATP-binding pocket, a hinge region, and a C-lobe, which forms the platform for the metal-binding loop and the catalytic loop. However, the RIO kinase domain contains only three of the canonical ePK α-helices (αE, αF, and αI) in the C-lobe. In both Rio1 and Rio2, an additional α-helix (αR) located N-terminal to the canonical N-lobe β-sheet extends the RIO domain (Fig. 2, A and B). Unlike ePKs, all RIO domains contain an insertion of 18–27 amino acids between αC and β3. That region was named the “flexible loop” because it was largely disordered in the structure of Rio2. An equivalent chain was partially disordered in the structure of Rio1 complexed with ATP but was generally ordered, although with some side chains not visible in the enzyme without ATP. Comparison of the RIO structures with that of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) showed that the RIO kinase domains lack the activation or “APE” loop (subdomain VIII), as well as subdomains X and XI of canonical ePKs. In addition to the N-terminal α-helix specific to the RIO domain, Rio1 contains another two α-helices N-terminal to the RIO domain, as opposed to the complete winged helix domain present in Rio2. The structures of Rio1 and Rio2 have been solved in complexes with ATP, ADP, and AMPPNP. The mode of binding of the nucleotides is similar in the two subfamilies, although some differences exist. The nucleotides are bound between the N-lobe and the C-lobe and are in contact with the hinge region, the P-loop, the metal-binding loop, and the catalytic loop (Fig. 2). In Rio1, the adenosine base participates in two hydrogen bonds with the hinge region, one from the peptide carbonyl oxygen of conserved Glu-148 to the amino group N6 and one from the peptide amine of Ile-150 to the indole nitrogen N1. The ribose moiety is contacted through water-mediated hydrogen bonds from the 2′-hydroxyl to Glu-162 and 3′-hydroxyl to the backbone carbonyl oxygen of conserved Tyr-200. The triphosphate group is held in place by several contacts with conserved residues (Fig. 2C). The P-loop interacts through three water-mediated hydrogen bonds: between the hydroxyl side chain of conserved Ser-56 and one of the β-phosphate oxygens, between the backbone amine of conserved Lys-59 to the oxygen bridging the β- and γ-phosphate, and between the side chain carboxylate of conserved Glu-81 to one of the γ-phosphate oxygens. The single Mn2+ ion seen in the ATP complex coordinates oxygens from the β- and α-phosphates, the carbonyl oxygen of the catalytic loop residue Asn-201, and a carboxyl oxygen from the metal-binding loop residue Asp-212 along with two water molecules. Additional contacts with the triphosphates are made through the side chain amino group of Lys-80 (conserved in all protein kinases) to α- and γ-phosphate oxygens, through a direct hydrogen bond between a carboxyl oxygen of the side chain of Asp-212 and a γ-phosphate oxygen, and interestingly, through a water-mediated interaction between the indole nitrogen of Trp-116 from the end of helix αC and a γ-phosphate oxygen. In the ADP complex, a water molecule replaces the γ-phosphate, but no significant conformational changes are observed in the active site. Although the adenosine ring is buried deeper in Rio1 than in Rio2 proteins, the γ-phosphate is significantly more accessible in the former (Fig. 2D). In the structure of Rio2 bound to ATP and Mn2+, the γ-phosphate is buried through the ordering and binding of three residues of the N-terminal end of the flexible loop (15LaRonde-LeBlanc N. Guszczynski T. Copeland T.D. Wlodawer A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2800-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The P-loops of Rio1 and Rio2 are in different positions relative to the γ-phosphate, closer in the latter than in the former. The γ-phosphate is also more tightly bound in Rio2, where a second metal ion is seen which coordinates the γ-phosphate, and each γ-phosphate oxygen participates in two interactions with the protein. In the case of Rio1, no metal ion is seen contacting the γ-phosphate, and one of the phosphate oxygens makes no interactions with the protein. It is therefore conceivable that release of the γ-phosphate may be more difficult in Rio2 than Rio1 or may require further rearrangement of the Rio2 molecule. The absence of a metal ion contact between the γ-phosphate and the metal ion in the Rio1 complex is curious since the metal ion is required for catalysis of phosphoryl transfer. Therefore, it is conceivable that in the presence of substrate a second metal ion binding site may be occupied to participate in the enzymatic reaction. The conformation of the nucleotides in the RIO kinases is unique when compared with ePKs, such as serine/threonine kinases PKA and CK1 (casein kinase) or the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase IRK (12LaRonde-LeBlanc N. Guszczynski T. Copeland T. Wlodawer A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3698-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 15LaRonde-LeBlanc N. Guszczynski T. Copeland T.D. Wlodawer A.

The difference in position of the γ-phosphate results in a difference in the distance between the catalytic aspartate residue and the γ-phosphate. In PKA, this distance is 3.8 Å, whereas in Rio2 an equivalent distance is 5.8 Å and in Rio1, 5.1 Å. It should be noted that in IRK this distance is also 5.8 Å for a complex with AMPPNP. Combined, these data suggest that the detailed mechanism by which the catalytic aspartate of RIO kinases participates in phosphoryl transfer may not be identical to that employed in known serine/threonine ePKs. It has been shown that mutation of the putative catalytic aspartate to alanine in phosphorylase kinase results in an enzyme that still retains about 0.1% of its catalytic efficiency (19Skamnaki V.T.

Whereas no detailed kinetic data have been collected for RIO proteins, equivalent mutants of yeast Rio2 and A. fulgidus Rio1 retain a low level of activity (5Geerlings T.H. Faber A.W.

FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3698-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Analysis of the sequence alignments of the RIO proteins shows the presence of additional domains specific for each subfamily (Fig. 1). Only one such domain has been characterized structurally to date. The N-terminal domain of Rio2, conserved in different members of this subfamily and not present in the Rio1 subfamily, is structurally homologous to the winged helix (wHTH) domain (Fig. 2B). In AfRio2, the N-terminal domain contains four α-helices followed by two β-strands and a fifth α-helix. A strand that connects the second and third α-helices combines with the other two β-strands to form a β-sheet, and the loop between the second and third β-strands is called a “wing,” which gives the wHTH its name. No analogous combination of a wHTH domain and a kinase domain has been previously reported. The nearest structural neighbors to the AfRio2 wHTH domain include transcription factors MarR and SlyA and histone linker protein GH5. The most commonly reported function of such domains is DNA binding, and they have been shown to bind DNA in two different ways (20Gajiwala K.S. Burley S.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 21Wolberger C. Campbell R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 261-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The most common DNA-binding mode, first reported in the crystal structure of transcription factor HNF-3 bound to DNA, is through site-specific interactions in the major grooves with residues on α-helix 3 (22Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). The second mode, characterized by the crystal structure of hRFX1 bound to DNA, involves specific interactions of W1, β2, and β3 with the major groove of the DNA (23Gajiwala K.S. Chen H. Cornille F. Roques B.P. Reith W. Mach B. Burley S.K. Nature. 2000; 403: 916-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Initial experiments have indicated that Rio2 may bind nonspecifically to single-stranded oligonucleotides. 3N. LaRonde-LeBlanc and A. Wlodawer, unpublished data. The structure and function of other domains that are part of the RIO proteins are not known at this time. They include a lysine-rich domain at the C terminus of the Rio1 proteins from yeast to humans and a N-terminal domain for which no homology was detected in the Rio3 subfamily. In yeast, deletion of the last 80 residues of the C-terminal domain results in loss of Rio1 function with an increase in in vitro kinase activity, suggesting a separate function for this domain (3Angermayr M. Roidl A. Bandlow W. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). At this time, no reports of purification of human RIO kinases can be found, but some of these enzymes have been characterized at the DNA/RNA level. The levels of Rio1 mRNA expressed in human tumor tissues were investigated, indicating that this gene is overexpressed in comparison with the adjacent non-cancerous tissue and exhibits differential tissue distribution (24Line A. Slucka Z. Stengrevics A. Silina K. Li G. Rees R.C. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2002; 51: 574-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The principal transcript of its gene, designated AD034 (NM_031480), is a protein consisting of 569 amino acids. A splice variant that encodes a truncated protein consisting of the C-terminal 328 amino acids (NM_153005) was also reported. The DNA sequence of human Rio2 (NM_018343), also designated FLJ11159, encodes a protein consisting of 553 amino acids. Human Rio3 was also characterized at the DNA level only, in two splice variants, and was identified as a protein up-regulated in the core of malignant melanomas (25Anaya P. Evans S.C. Dai C. Lozano G. May G.S. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 211: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 26Roesch A. Vogt T. Stolz W. Dugas M. Landthaler M. Becker B. Melanoma Res. 2003; 13: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The longer variant (NM_003831) consists of 520 amino acids and was characterized to be a homolog of Aspergillus nidulans sudD (25Anaya P. Evans S.C. Dai C. Lozano G. May G.S. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 211: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The shorter variant (NM_145906) contains the N-terminal 425 amino acids only. It is not clear if the shorter variants of Rio1 and Rio3 are ever translated into proteins. No mutations in any of the human RIO proteins were found in a screen of the complete protein kinase gene family aimed at identifying somatic mutations in human breast cancer (27Stephens P. Edkins S. Davies H. Greenman C. Cox C. Hunter C. Bignell G. Teague J. Smith R. Stevens C. O'Meara S. Parker A. Tarpey P. Avis T. Barthorpe A. Brackenbury L. Buck G. Butler A. Clements J. Cole J. Dicks E.

This result might be interpreted as indicating that functional RIO proteins are necessary for survival of the cells in humans, as they are in yeast. The ubiquitous presence of RIO kinases in a variety of organisms, the requirement that the enzymatic activity be present for cell survival, and the involvement in ribosome biogenesis, one of the fundamental processes in all living cells, all suggest that this family of atypical kinases should be further investigated with the aim of establishing if it might present a novel target for drug design. The difficulty in designing specific kinase inhibitors lies in the similarity of their target sites, which usually are limited to the nucleotide-binding regions. Although considerable progress in creating very specific inhibitors of ePKs has been recently reported (28Cohen M.S. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Taunton J. Science. 2005; 308: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), the advantage of atypical kinases such as RIOs might be in their differences from the better known counterparts. The lack of the peptide substrate binding loop in RIO kinases, for example, suggests a potentially very different binding mode of the protein substrates. No structural data on peptide binding are available at this time, but such information should become available if the present rapid pace of investigations of this novel kinase family continues into the future."
https://openalex.org/W2062608511,"Plakoglobin (PG) is a member of the Armadillo family of adhesion/signaling proteins that can be incorporated into both adherens junctions and desmosomes. Loss of PG results in defects in the mechanical integrity of heart and skin and decreased adhesive strength in keratinocyte cultures established from the skin of PG knock-out (PG-/-) mice, the latter of which cannot be compensated for by overexpressing the closely related β-catenin. In this study, we examined the mechanisms of PG-regulated adhesion in murine keratinocytes. Biochemical and morphological analyses indicated that junctional incorporation of desmosomal, but not adherens junction, components was impaired in PG-/- cells compared with PG+/- controls. Re-expression of PG, but not β-catenin, in PG-/- cells largely reversed these effects, indicating a key role for PG in desmosome assembly. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor activation resulted in Tyr phosphorylation of PG, which was accompanied by a loss of desmoplakin from desmosomes and decreased adhesive strength following 18-h EGF treatment. Importantly, introduction of a phosphorylation-deficient PG mutant into PG null cells prevented the EGF receptor-dependent loss of desmoplakin from junctions, attenuating the effects of long term EGF treatment on cell adhesion. Therefore, PG is essential for maintaining and regulating adhesive strength in keratinocytes largely through its contributions to desmosome assembly and structure. As a target for modulation by EGF, regulation of PG-dependent adhesion may play an important role during wound healing and tumor metastasis.

As a target for modulation by EGF, regulation of PG-dependent adhesion may play an important role during wound healing and tumor metastasis. Adherens junctions and desmosomes are intercellular junctions that link the actin and intermediate filament (IF) 2The abbreviations used are: IFintermediate filamentPGplakoglobinDPdesmoplakinDsgdesmogleinEGFepidermal growth factorWTwild typeEGFREGF receptorPKIprotein kinase inhibitorGFPgreen fluorescent protein. cytoskeleton to sites of cadherin-based adhesion, respectively. These junctions both utilize members of the Armadillo family of signaling/adhesion molecules to connect the cadherin cytoplasmic domains to cytoskeleton linker proteins, α-catenin/vinculin in adherens junction and the plakin family member desmoplakin (DP) in desmosomes, as well as to regulate the stability and strength of these junctions (1Garrod D.R.

Gaudry C.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Two important Armadillo adapters are β-catenin and plakoglobin. β-Catenin normally binds exclusively to classic cadherins and is restricted to adherens junctions. However, plakoglobin (PG) is able to associate with classic and desmosomal cadherins and can be found in both adherens junctions and desmosomes (5Cowin P. Kapprell H.P. Franke W.W. Tamkun J. Hynes R.O. Cell. 1986; 46: 1063-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In light of the interdependence of adherens junctions and desmosomes during their formation and maturation (6Lewis J.E. Wahl III, J.K. Sass K.M. Jensen P.J. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 919-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 7Vasioukhin V. Bowers E. Bauer C. Degenstein L. Fuchs E. Nat.

Bannon L.J. Amargo E.V. Hudson T.Y. Mongiu A.K. Leigh I.M. Kelsell D.P. Gumbiner B.M. Green K.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1005-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), it is possible that PG strengthens adhesion through its incorporation into both organelles. However, the molecular mechanism of PG-regulated adhesion remains poorly understood. intermediate filament plakoglobin desmoplakin desmoglein epidermal growth factor wild type EGF receptor protein kinase inhibitor green fluorescent protein. Intercellular adhesion is also constantly subject to modulation, especially during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions that occur during development and wound healing (9Gumbiner B.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). During tumor metastasis, down-regulation of cell adhesion is a critical step, since it has been observed that tumor cells migrate from the tumor mass as single cells (10Condeelis J. Segall J.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Receptor tyrosine kinases, including members of the EGFR family, are critical participants in the process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (11Thiery J.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 740-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). In addition to its mitogenic activity, epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been shown to promote motility in epithelial cells including keratinocytes (12Boyer B. Roche S. Denoyelle M. Thiery J.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5904-5913Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 13Cha D. O'Brien P. O'Toole E.A. Woodley D.T. Hudson L.G. J. Invest.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Both β-catenin and PG have been identified as targets for EGFR-dependent phosphorylation, and it is thought that modulation of intercellular adhesion contributes to the acquisition of motility during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (15Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5531) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, EGF treatment of HSC-1 squamous carcinoma cells and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells resulted in tyrosine (Tyr) phosphorylation of β-catenin and dissociation of adherens junction molecules from the adhesion complex (16Fujii K. Furukawa F. Matsuyoshi N. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 50-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Hazan R.B. Norton L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9078-9084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In vitro assays confirmed that EGFR specifically phosphorylates β-catenin at Tyr654, and this phosphorylation leads to significantly decreased binding to E-cadherin (18Miravet S. Piedra J. Castano J. Raurell I. Franci C. Dunach M. Garcia De Herreros A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7391-7402Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Less attention has been paid to the effects of EGF stimulation on the stability and assembly state of desmosomes. These adhesive organelles are crucially important in maintaining the mechanical integrity of epithelial and other stress-bearing tissues by tethering IF to the membrane through protein adhesion complexes containing DP and PG (19Getsios S. Huen A.C. Green K.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The important role of PG in tissue integrity and function is demonstrated by skin and heart defects in PG knock-out mice (20Bierkamp C. McLaughlin K.J. Schwarz H. Huber O. Kemler R. Dev.

Loss of PG leads to decreased number and altered structure of desmosomes in the epidermis of mouse skin (20Bierkamp C. McLaughlin K.J. Schwarz H. Huber O. Kemler R. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 780-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and PG null keratinocytes exhibited weakened intercellular adhesion (24Caldelari R. de Bruin A. Baumann D. Suter M.M. Bierkamp C. Balmer V. Muller E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 25Yin T. Getsios S. Caldelari R. Kowalczyk A.P. Muller E.J. Jones J.C. Green K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5420-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Likewise, the proper recruitment and distribution of the PG-associated protein DP to desmosomal plaques is required for IF attachment as well as strong intercellular adhesion and epithelial integrity in vitro and in vivo (7Vasioukhin V. Bowers E. Bauer C. Degenstein L. Fuchs E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1076-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 8Huen A.C. Park J.K. Godsel L.M. Chen X. Bannon L.J. Amargo E.V. Hudson T.Y.

Modulation of these junctions by altering desmosome protein-protein interactions is thus likely to make an important contribution to remodeling of tissues during wound healing and metastasis. This idea is supported by the observation that blocking EGFR signaling promoted desmosome assembly and increased cell-cell adhesion in oral squamous carcinoma cells (26Lorch J.H. Klessner J. Park J.K. Getsios S. Wu Y.L. Stack M.S. Green K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37191-37200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A variety of Tyr kinases have been found to phosphorylate PG at specific sites and induce distinct effects on its association with adhesion partners (27Solanas G. Miravet S. Casagolda D. Castano J. Raurell I. Corrionero A. de Herreros A.G. Dunach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49849-49856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). EGFR activation results in PG phosphorylation at a three-Tyr cluster in its C-terminal domain (Tyr693, Tyr724, and Tyr729). This phosphorylation leads to the dissociation of PG from the N-terminal domain of DP (18Miravet S. Piedra J. Castano J. Raurell I. Franci C. Dunach M. Garcia De Herreros A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7391-7402Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 28Gaudry C.A. Palka H.L. Dusek R.L. Huen A.C. Khandekar M.J. Hudson L.G. Green K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24871-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, a direct connection between EGFR-dependent phosphorylation of PG and potential alterations in adhesive strength between cells has not been demonstrated. To determine the underlying mechanism by which PG strengthens adhesion and to examine how PG-dependent adhesion is regulated, we employed keratinocyte cultures established from the skin of PG knockout mice and an EGFR-dependent phosphorylation deficient PG mutant (24Caldelari R. de Bruin A. Baumann D. Suter M.M. Bierkamp C. Balmer V. Muller E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 28Gaudry C.A. Palka H.L. Dusek R.L. Huen A.C. Khandekar M.J. Hudson L.G. Green K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24871-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We show that the previously demonstrated decreased adhesive strength in PG-/- cells is accompanied by reduced steady state protein levels and junction incorporation of desmosomal components, whereas adherens junction assembly remains largely unaffected. Long-term EGF treatment decreased junction localization of DP as well as adhesive strength in control PG+/- cells and PG-/- cells expressing ectopic PG. These alterations were both attenuated in PG null cells expressing a PG mutant deficient in EGFR-dependent phosphorylation. Therefore, PG is not only an integral component of the desmosomal adhesive complex but also provides a mechanism for regulating desmosomal adhesion in response to growth factor stimulation. Cell Culture—Keratinocyte cultures established from the skin of PG+/- or PG-/- mice (24Caldelari R. de Bruin A. Baumann D. Suter M.M. Bierkamp C. Balmer V. Muller E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) were cultured in defined keratinocyte SFM (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10 ng/ml EGF and 10-10 m cholera toxin. In experiments where calcium concentration was varied, cells were incubated in calcium-free keratinocyte SFM (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10 ng/ml EGF and 10-10 m cholera toxin, with calcium level achieved by adding CaCl2. For starvation, cells were switched to unsupplemented defined keratinocyte SFM (Invitrogen) with calcium concentration adjusted to the appropriate level using 1 m CaCl2. In experiments examining the effects of EGF stimulation, cells were starved in 0.3 mm calcium (starvation medium) for 8 h and then rinsed and incubated in starvation medium containing Me2SO for 18 h as control or in Me2SO-containing starvation medium for 17 h and then treated with 10 nm EGF for 1 h or in starvation medium plus 10 nm EGF for 18 h. In some experiments, cells were treated with 10 μm PKI166 (Novartis), a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks EGFR/ErbB2 activation (29Janmaat M.L. Giaccone G. Drugs Today (Barc.). 2003; 39: 61-80PubMed Google Scholar). For these experiments, cultures were either incubated in starvation medium for 17 h in PKI prior to 1-h EGF treatment (PKI 18hrs EGF 1h) or in 10 μm PKI166 plus 10 nm of EGF for 18 h (PKI + EGF 18hrs). Generation of Adenoviruses—The pAdeasy adenovirus-packaging system was kindly provided by Dr. W. G. Tourtellotte (Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine). Previously characterized Myc-tagged, full-length PG (PG) and PG mutants with Tyr693, Tyr724, and Tyr729 mutated to Phe (3YF) (28Gaudry C.A. Palka H.L. Dusek R.L. Huen A.C. Khandekar M.J. Hudson L.G.

Infection rates were monitored using the GFP expressed in tandem with the construct of interest, and ∼90% infection was achieved for all constructs in all experiments. The recombinant adenoviruses carrying the Myc-tagged human β-catenin were characterized previously (31Xiao K. Allison D.F. Kottke M.D. Summers S. Sorescu G.P. Faundez V. Kowalczyk A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19199-19208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Full-length PG was detected with 1407 (28Gaudry C.A. Palka H.L. Dusek R.L. Huen A.C.

For PG immunoprecipitation, a mouse monoclonal antibody γ-catenin was used (BD Biosciences). DP was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody NW6 (32Angst B.D. Nilles L.A. Green K.J. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 247-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A mouse monoclonal antibody 4B2 cross-reacting with the cytoplasmic domain of desmoglein (Dsg) 1 and Dsg 2 (Dsg1/2) was characterized by Dusek et al. 3R. L. Dusek, S. Getsios, F. Chen, J. K. Park, E. V. Amargo, V. L. Cryns, and K. J. Green, submitted for publication. The rabbit polyclonal Dsg3 antibody 3067 was a gift from Dr. J. R. Stanley (University of Pennsylvania). The rabbit polyclonal β-catenin antibody c-2206 and rat polyclonal E-cadherin antibody DECMA were purchased from Sigma. The Myc-tagged proteins were detected with a rabbit polyclonal Myc antibody purchased from Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX). The anti-phosphotyrosine mouse monoclonal antibody clone 4G10 was from Upstate USA, Inc. The mouse monoclonal GFP antibody JL-8 was from BD Biosciences. The following dilutions were used for the above antibodies in Western blots: 1407 (1:5000), NW6 (1:2500), 4B2 (1:100), 3067 (1:5000), c-2206 (1:5000), DECMA (1:500), Myc (1:10,000), 4G10 (1:500), and JL-8 (1:2000). For immunoprecipitation, 3 μl of γ-catenin antibody was used per 500 μl of lysate. Immunofluorescence, Western Blot, and Triton Solubility Assay—Western blot and immunofluorescence were performed as described previously (8Huen A.C. Park J.K. Godsel L.M. Chen X. Bannon L.J. Amargo E.V. Hudson T.Y. Mongiu A.K. Leigh I.M. Kelsell D.P. Gumbiner B.M. Green K.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1005-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For analysis of the Triton X-100-insoluble pool, cells were lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100 buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 145 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 10 min). Triton X-100-insoluble pellets were solubilized in urea sample buffer (33Kowalczyk A.P. Bornslaeger E.A. Borgwardt J.E. Palka H.L. Dhaliwal A.S. Corcoran C.M. Denning M.F. Green K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and then subjected to Western blot analysis. Densitometry analysis was performed using Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). Mechanical Cell Dissociation Assay—Confluent keratinocyte cultures were incubated in dispase (1 unit/ml; Roche Applied Science) until detached from the culture dishes as previously described (8Huen A.C. Park J.K. Godsel L.M. Chen X. Bannon L.J. Amargo E.V. Hudson T.Y. Mongiu A.K. Leigh I.M. Kelsell D.P. Gumbiner B.M. Green K.J. J.

Released intact monolayers were carefully washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and transferred to 15-ml conical tubes. Enough Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline was added for a final volume of 5 ml. Tubes were subjected to 30 inversion cycles. Fragments of the cell monolayers generated by shear stress were counted, and statistical analysis was performed on the average of three separate experiments. An increased number of fragments reflected weakened intercellular adhesion. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitations were performed using appropriate antibodies as described previously (28Gaudry C.A. Palka H.L. Dusek R.L. Huen A.C. Khandekar M.J. Hudson L.G. Green K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24871-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For immune complex retrieval, 40 μl of Gamma Bind Plus Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were used per reaction. Immune complexes were released by incubation in Laemmli sample buffer at 95 °C and were subjected to Western blot analysis. PG-/- Cells Exhibit Decreased Expression and Membrane Incorporation of Desmosomal Proteins—To determine the mechanism by which PG strengthens adhesion, we utilized keratinocyte cultures established from the skin of PG-/- mice, which we previously showed exhibit weakened intercellular adhesion (24Caldelari R. de Bruin A. Baumann D. Suter M.M. Bierkamp C. Balmer V. Muller E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We first examined whether the protein levels of desmosomal adhesion molecules were altered in PG-/- cells cultured at varying calcium concentrations. PG+/- and PG-/- cells were switched to medium containing 0.05, 0.07, 0.2, 0.65, or 1.2 mm calcium for 3 days and then lysed and subjected to Western blot analysis using appropriate antibodies. Consistent with previous observations (24Caldelari R. de Bruin A. Baumann D. Suter M.M. Bierkamp C. Balmer V. Muller E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), PG-/- keratinocytes did not express PG. An antibody (4B2) cross-reacting with both Dsg1 and Dsg2 (Dsg1/2) detected a marked decrease in steady state levels in PG-/- cells compared with PG+/- cells at all calcium concentrations tested. Dsgs appeared as doublets that were most pronounced in the PG-/- cells. DP I/II (34Mueller H. Franke W.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 163: 647-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and Dsg3 were also down-regulated at lower calcium concentrations in PG-/- cells. Furthermore, Dsg1/2, and to a lesser extent DP I/II, levels were still somewhat depressed at 1.2 mm calcium in PG-/- cells compared with PG+/- cells (Fig. 1A). To test whether loss of PG affects the proper junction incorporation of desmosomal proteins, we first examined the Triton solubility of adhesion proteins in these two cell lines. PG+/- and PG-/- cells cultured at different calcium levels were lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100 buffer and divided into Triton-soluble and Triton-insoluble pools, with the Triton-insoluble pool, most likely representing the protein that is associated with the IF network (35Pasdar M. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 36Pasdar M. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 163-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The ratios of Triton-insoluble/Triton-soluble pool of Dsg1/2, Dsg3, and DP were decreased in PG-/- cells compared with PG+/- cells at all calcium concentrations tested (Fig. 1B), with the most striking change exhibited by DP. These data suggest that desmosomal proteins are not as stably associated with the cytoskeleton and/or junctions in PG-/- cells. We then examined the membrane localization of desmosomal proteins in response to increased calcium concentration in PG+/- and PG-/- cells using immunofluorescence. PG+/- and PG-/- cells were switched to medium containing the indicated concentration of calcium for 24 h prior to fixation and immunofluorescence analysis. At 0.05 mm calcium, neither DP nor Dsg1/2 was localized at cell-cell borders in either cell line. When the calcium level was increased to 0.2 mm, Dsg1/2 and DP readily co-localized at junctions in a dotty desmosomal staining pattern in PG+/- cells. On the other hand, although DP began to appear at PG-/- cell-cell borders in 0.2 mm calcium, Dsg1/2 was not detected at the plasma membrane until the calcium level was raised to 1.2 mm. In addition, DP staining often appeared more continuous in PG-/- cells in contrast with the dotty staining pattern in PG+/- cells (Fig. 1C). Taken together, PG-/- cells exhibited defects in both protein levels and membrane recruitment of desmosomal proteins. Adherens Junctions Are Not Comparably Affected in PG-/- Cells—Because PG can be incorporated into adherens junctions, we also examined the protein levels and membrane association of E-cadherin and β-catenin. Although some studies suggested that PG may regulate the levels of β-catenin by competing for the binding of degradation machinery (37Miller J.R. Hocking A.M. Brown J.D. Moon R.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7860-7872Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 38Simcha I. Shtutman M. Salomon D. Zhurinsky J. Sadot E. Geiger B. BenZe'ev A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1433-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), we did not observe changes in β-catenin levels in PG-/- cells (Fig. 2A). The detergent solubility of β-catenin was also comparable in both cell lines (Fig. 2B). The steady state level of the classical cadherin, E-cadherin, was moderately decreased in PG-/- cells compared with PG+/- cells (Fig. 2A). Nevertheless, the Triton solubility profiles for E-cadherin were comparable in both cell lines especially at the high calcium concentrations (Fig. 2B). We then examined the localization of E-cadherin and β-catenin in PG-/- and PG+/- cells at different calcium concentrations. In contrast to DP and Dsg1/2 staining, the localization of E-cadherin and β-catenin as well as their recruitment to the borders in response increased calcium level were comparable in PG+/- and PG-/- to cells (Fig. 2C). Reintroduction of PG into PG Null Cells Leads to an Accumulation of Junction-associated Desmosomal Proteins—We demonstrated previously that re-expression of PG, but not the closely related β-catenin in PG-/- cells, restored adhesive strength (25Yin T. Getsios S. Caldelari R. Kowalczyk A.P. Muller E.J. Jones J.C. Green K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5420-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To test whether PG strengthens adhesion through the regulation of protein levels and/or junction incorporation of desmosomal proteins, we infected PG-/- cells with adenoviruses encoding Myc-tagged PG, β-catenin, or GFP control. The cells were incubated in medium containing 0.65 mm calcium for 3 days and then lysed and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Note that infection of PG-/- cells with adenoviruses frequently resulted in a modest decrease in the expression level of DP and Dsg1/2 compared with uninfected PG-/- cells. However, compared with GFP or β-catenin, expression of PG resulted in varying degrees of recovery of DP and Dsg1/2, bringing levels closer to those of the endogenous proteins in the PG+/- cells. Moreover, expression of PG in PG-/- cells altered the banding pattern of Dsg1/2 to that resembling PG+/- cells. The steady state levels of adherens junction proteins E-cadherin and β-catenin were largely unaffected by expressing PG (Fig. 3A). We then examined the effect of PG expression on solubility status of junctional proteins. PG-/- cells infected with adenoviruses encoding PG or β-catenin or GFP were switched to medium containing 0.65 mm calcium for 3 days and then subjected to fractionation into Triton-soluble and -insoluble pools. The protein level of DP and Dsg1/2, but not E-cadherin, was increased in the Triton-insoluble pool of vPG versus vGFP cells (Fig. 3B), whereas the soluble pool was relatively unchanged. β-Catenin expression also led to a somewhat more modest increase in the insoluble pool of DP but not Dsg1/2. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that virally expressed PG efficiently recruited Dsg1/2 to the junctions in PG-/- cells, whereas β-catenin and GFP failed to do so (Fig. 3C). These results demonstrate that PG primarily increases the steady state level and assembly of desmosome components without detectably affecting adherens junction status. EGF Treatment Results in Tyr Phosphorylation of PG and Decreases Intercellular Adhesion in Keratinocytes—Toward addressing whether EGF treatment regulates desmosomal adhesion in normal keratinocytes, we examined desmosome protein distribution in PG+/- cells after growth factor treatment. We focused primarily on the protein interaction partners DP and PG, based on previous work demonstrating that tyrosine phosphorylation of PG compromised its interaction with DP without altering its association with Dsg (28Gaudry C.A. Palka H.L. Dusek R.L. Huen A.C. Khandekar M.J. Hudson L.G. Green K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24871-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because high calcium promotes the maturation of desmosomes, which may become resistant to destabilizing stimuli (39Mattey D.L. Garrod D.R. J. Cell Sci. 1986; 85: 113-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we performed experiments at a calcium concentration of 0.3 mm, which allows desmosome formation while enhancing the effects of EGF stimulation. PG+/- cells were starved in 0.3 mm calcium for 8 h and then treated with 10 nm EGF for 1 or 18 h. The cells were then fixed, and the localization of DP and PG was examined by immunofluorescence. DP and PG localized at cell-cell borders in a dotty pattern in starved PG+/- cells. Upon1hofEGF treatment, DP staining was reduced at the borders and increased in the cytoplasm. Whereas intercellular PG staining was retained, the fluorescence pattern was less regular, and the borders appeared ruffled. After 18 h of EGF treatment, DP staining was largely absent from cell-cell borders, whereas PG staining remained (Fig. 4A). To confirm that the changes in DP and PG staining patterns in EGF-treated cells were the result of EGFR activation, we treated cells with 10 μm PKI166, a small molec"

This family of signaling kinases comprises the classical (α, βI, βII, and γ), novel (δ, ϵ, η, and θ), and atypical (ζ and λ/i) PKCs, which have differential patterns of cell and tissue distribution and unique modes of regulation (1Dempsey E.C.

Phorbol esters, natural compounds that potently activate the classical and novel PKCs, trigger a plethora of cellular responses that vary depending on the cell type and the relative expression of individual PKC isozymes. Whereas phorbol esters are capable of promoting mitogenic or survival responses, many cell types undergo growth arrest or apoptosis in response to PKC activation. A major reason for such heterogeneity is the diversity of pathways activated by each PKC isozyme, their distinct relocalization, and their differential access to substrates upon activation (2Yang C. Kazanietz M.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 602-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Such functional diversity is exemplified by the novel PKCs: whereas in most cases PKCϵ acts as a mitogenic or anti-apoptotic kinase, PKCδ generally inhibits proliferation, or in some cell types it triggers an apoptotic response and is required for drug-induced apoptosis (3Brodie C. Blumberg P.M. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Dissecting the signaling events regulated by individual PKCs still represents a major challenge and will certainly help to understand the functional roles of PKC isozymes in normal and cancer cells. protein kinase C Fas-associated protein with a death domain TNFα-converting enzyme mitogen-activated protein kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate tumor necrosis factor α conditioned medium 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole RNA interference double-stranded enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tumor necrosis factor receptor tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand Androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells, such as LNCaP cells, represents one of the most studied models for phorbol ester-induced apoptosis via PKC activation (4Powell C.T.

Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulates apoptosis in LNCaP cells and xenografts, and it sensitizes LNCaP tumors in mice to the apoptotic effects of ionizing radiation (6Garzotto M.

We and others have assigned a key role to PKCδ as a mediator of phorbol ester-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells (8Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Bernabo J.L. Caamano J. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Li L.

Unlike observed in other cell types, activation of PKCδ in prostate cancer cells is independent of its cleavage to a catalytically active form, but it rather depends on allosteric mechanisms upon translocation to membranes (8Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Bernabo J.L. Caamano J. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Li L. Yuspa S.H. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7574-7582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). PKCϵ, on the other hand, was shown to stimulate proliferation in LNCaP cells and cause progression to an androgen-independent state (11Wu D. Foreman T.L. Gregory C.W. McJilton M.A. Wescott G.G. Ford O.H. Alvey R.F. Mohler J.L. Terrian D.M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2423-2429PubMed Google Scholar). Signaling studies have determined an essential role for p38 MAPK and ceramide as mediators of phorbol ester-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells (6Garzotto M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Liao W.C.

Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and in addition, a modulatory role for the JNK interacting protein 1 (JIP-1, an inhibitor of JNK) has been recently postulated (13Ikezoe T. Yang Y. Taguchi H. Koeffler H.P. Br. J. Cancer. 2004; 90: 2017-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), suggesting complex modes of regulation downstream of PKC in prostate cancer cells. The relative contribution of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic cascades in this context remains to be determined. However, as many of the aforementioned pathways are known effectors of death receptor ligands, such as TNFα, TRAIL, or FasL, it is reasonable to speculate that phorbol ester-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells might involve the activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. It has been known for years that phorbol esters are capable of stimulating the release of autocrine or paracrine factors that modulate PKC cellular responses. For example, conditioned medium (CM) collected from PKCϵ-overexpressing R6 fibroblasts stimulates DNA synthesis and causes morphologic transformation. Transforming growth factor-β release has been associated, at least in part, to the growth abnormalities caused by PKCϵ overexpression (14Cacace A.M. Ueffing M. Han E.K. Marme D. Weinstein I.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Limited information, however, is available on the potential contribution of autocrine factors to apoptotic responses caused by PKC activation. One attractive, yet unexplored hypothesis, is that prostate cancer cell death upon phorbol ester stimulation involves the activation of an apoptotic autocrine loop that stimulates death receptors and the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. In the present study we demonstrate that the induction of apoptosis in LNCaP prostate cancer cells by PKC involves the secretion of death ligands. Moreover, by means of a series of pharmacological and molecular approaches, we have established that the novel PKCδ is crucial in this autocrine regulation, playing roles both in autocrine factor release as well as downstream of death receptor activation. The identification of this novel autocrine mechanism highlights the complexities of PKC signaling and may have great implications in the identification of novel targets for prostate cancer therapy.

Cell Culture—LNCaP human prostate cancer cells were purchased from ATCC. Cells (passages 2-10) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin (100 units/ml)-streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Collection of CM—Cells (∼70% confluence) were treated with PMA (100 nm) or vehicle (ethanol) for 1 h, and then washed twice with medium to remove the phorbol ester or vehicle. After incubation for different times, CM was collected, filtered, and added to fresh LNCaP cells (∼70% confluence). When indicated, CM was dialyzed using 12-14-kDa cut-off membranes for 36 h at 4 °C against RPMI medium, which was changed each 12 h. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested into lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and then lysed by sonication. Equal amounts of protein (20 μg/lane) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk or 5% bovine serum albumin in 0.05% Tween 20/phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h. After washing three times with 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, membranes were incubated for 1 h with either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:3000, Bio-Rad). Bands were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection system. Densitometric analysis was performed using Image software (National Institutes of Health) under conditions that yielded a linear response. Apoptosis Assays—Cells were trypsinized, mounted on glass slides, and then fixed in 70% ethanol. Morphological changes in chromatin structure were assessed after staining with DAPI, as described previously (8Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Bernabo J.L. Caamano J. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Li L. Yuspa S.H.

Apoptosis was characterized by chromatin condensation and fragmentation when examined by fluorescence microscopy. The incidence of apoptosis was analyzed by counting 500 cells followed by the determination of apoptotic cells in each preparation.

RNA Interference (RNAi)—Twenty-one bp dsRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The following target sequences were used: AAGUGCCACAAAGGAACCUAC (TNFR1), AACAGAGUGAGACCCUGUCUC (TNFR2), AAGCAGAAGAUUGAGGACCAC (DR5), AAGUGCAUGGACAGGGUGUGU (DR4); AAGUGCCACAAAGGAACCUAC (Fas), CCAUGAGUUUAUCGCCACC (PK-Cδ), and AACAUCGCUGUAGCAUCGUCU (control RNAi). TACE RNAi (AAACGAAAGCGAGTACACUGC) was purchased from Qiagen-Xeragon (Germantown, MD). DsRNAs (100 nm) were transfected into LNCaP cells using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. In each case, the optimal time for protein/RNA depletion after transfection was determined. Unless when indicated, experiments were carried out 48 h after transfection. Retroviral Infection of LNCaP Cells—Retroviral vectors encoding for short hairpin RNAi sequences to knock-down FADD or caspase-8, or encoding a mutated sequence for caspase-8 were kind gifts from Dr. Wafik el-Deiry (University of Pennsylvania). Empty vector p-SUPER Retro was used as a control. Retroviruses were obtained after transfection of Phoenix-Ampho packaging cells with the corresponding retroviral constructs by using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and collection of the supernatant. Subconfluent LNCaP cells in 6- or 12-well plates were infected with the different retroviruses for 14 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and Polybrene. After removal of the retrovirus by extensive washing, cells were incubated for 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Selection was carried out with 1 mg/ml puromycin. RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis—LNCaP cells were treated for 1 h with either PMA or vehicle. At different time points, cells were lysed and RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Five micrograms of RNA per sample were reverse transcribed using the First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Amersham Biosciences). Each reverse transcription reaction was performed in a total volume of 50 μl. Real-time PCR—PCR primers and fluorogenic probes for human TNFα were purchased from Applied Biosystems. The probes were 5′ end-labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM). Each PCR amplification was performed in a total volume of 12.5 μl, containing 6.25 μl of 2× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), commercial target primers (300 nm), the fluorescent probe (200 nm), and 1 μl of cDNA. PCR were performed with an ABI PRISM 7700 Detection System (TaqMan; Applied Biosystems) using the following conditions: 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 94 °C, followed by a total of 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The PCR product formation was continuously monitored during the PCR using Sequence Detection System software version 1.7 (Applied Biosystems). The FAM signal was normalized to the endogenous glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Results were expressed as -fold increase relative to those in untreated cells. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—TNFα levels were determined by ELISA using 2 μg/well of coating anti-TNFα antibody. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum in phosphate-buffered saline. CM (50 μl) was added in each well and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, 100 μl of a biotin-labeled anti-TNFα antibody (0.3 μg/ml) was added for 2 h at room temperature. Bound antibody was detected by incubation with peroxidase-labeled streptavidine and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzyazoline)-6-sulfonic acid, and absorbance was measured at 405 nm. TRAIL levels were determined using a Quantikine M kit from R&D Systems. PKC Translocation—Translocation was determined by Western blot using a subcellular fractionation technique, as previously reported (8Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Bernabo J.L. Caamano J. Ohba M.

To determine whether autocrine mechanisms could be involved in this effect, we first compared the activity of conditioned CM collected from PMA-treated cells (CM-PMA) and vehicle-treated cells (CM-vehicle). LNCaP cells were treated with PMA (100 nm, 1 h), and then washed extensively to remove the phorbol ester. When added to fresh LNCaP cells, CM-PMA caused a significant apoptotic response, as determined by apoptotic cell counting after DAPI staining. On the other hand, CM-vehicle did not cause cell death (Fig. 1, A and B). Flow cytometry analysis revealed a significant increase in the population of cells in sub-G0/G1 24 h after treatment either with PMA or CM-PMA (Fig. 1C). To determine that the effect was not because of PMA remaining in the CM despite the extensive washings, CM-PMA was dialyzed using 12-14-kDa cut-off dialysis membranes (molecular mass of PMA is 617). The apoptogenic activity of the CM-PMA was indeed retained after dialysis (Fig. 1D). CM-PMA collected from androgen-independent DU-145 and PC3 cells, as well as from Tsu-Pr1 cells (originally classified as a prostate cancer cell line but later re-classified as a bladder cancer cell line) also triggered an apoptotic response when added to fresh LNCaP cells. On the other hand, CM collected from NIH-3T3 cells treated with PMA in a manner similar to the prostate cancer cells was unable to cause apoptosis when added to fresh LNCaP cells (Fig. 1E). This experiment suggests that the effect is cell type-specific, and it also serves as a control for the absence of PMA in the CM after the washings. To determine whether the apoptotic effect of PMA was entirely dependent on the release of apoptotic factors, we performed consecutive washings every 15 min during the first 6 h after PMA treatment. We reasoned that this would prevent the accumulation of released autocrine factors in the CM. Remarkably, cells did not undergo apoptosis under this experimental condition (Fig. 1F), suggesting that the apoptotic effect of the phorbol ester was entirely dependent on the autocrine loop. Apoptotic activity was detected with CM from LNCaP cells collected shortly (1 h) after PMA treatment (data not shown), suggesting that the effect was probably independent of the synthesis of apoptotic factors. To further explore this issue, we collected CM from LNCaP cells treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (50 mm). A significant fraction of the apoptogenic effect of CM-PMA (∼70%) was retained after “de novo” protein synthesis inhibition (Fig. 1G), suggesting that the effect was largely caused by the release of pre-formed factors. PKCδ Has a Dual Role Both in Apoptotic Factor Release and as an Effector of CM-induced Apoptosis—PKCδ has been established as a key mediator of PMA-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells (8Fujii T.

Chem. 2005; 280: 5533-5541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To determine whether PKCδ is involved in the release of apoptotic factors, we collected CM from LNCaP cells treated with either the pan-PKC inhibitor GF109203X or the PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin (Fig. 2A). We found that CM collected after pharmacological inhibition of PKCδ had a significantly lower apoptotic effect when added to fresh LNCaP cells. GF109203X totally blocked the PMA effect. Because rottlerin is known to cause nonspecific effects unrelated to PKCδ inhibition (15Tillman D.M. Izeradjene K. Szucs K.S. Douglas L. Houghton J.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5118-5125PubMed Google Scholar), we used a RNAi approach, as we have previously described (9Tanaka Y. Gavrielides M.V. Mitsuuchi Y. Fujii T. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33753-33762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). PKCδ levels were reduced by ∼90% in LNCaP cells upon delivery of a specific dsRNA. This dsRNA specifically reduces the levels of PKCδ without affecting the expression of other PMA-responsive PKC isozymes present in LNCaP cells (Fig. 2C). Remarkably, CM-PMA collected from PKCδ-depleted cells has remarkably less apoptotic activity (Fig. 2A), arguing that PKCδ is required for the release of apoptogenic factors in response to PMA. PKCδ also plays a role as an effector of the apoptotic effect of CM-PMA. Indeed, when CM-PMA was added to PKCδ-depleted LNCaP cells, apoptosis was basically undetected. GF109203X and rottlerin also impaired the apoptotic effect of the CM-PMA. The inhibitory effect of rottlerin was not complete, probably because of its ability to cause apoptosis through nonspecific mechanisms (9Tanaka Y. Gavrielides M.V. Mitsuuchi Y. Fujii T. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33753-33762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 15Tillman D.M. Izeradjene K. Szucs K.S. Douglas L. Houghton J.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5118-5125PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the CM-PMA caused translocation of PKCδ in LNCaP cells (Fig. 2D). Thus, PKCδ appears to have a dual role, both in the release of apoptogenic factors as well as an effector. A Role for TNFα in the PKC-induced Autocrine Loop—As TNFα is known to cause cell death in LNCaP cells (12Kimura K. Markowski M. Edsall L.C. Spiegel S. Gelmann E.P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Chopra D.P. Menard R.E. Januszewski J. Mattingly R.R. Cancer Lett. 2004; 203: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we sought to investigate whether this cytokine was involved in the PKC-mediated autocrine effect. As a first approach we used TAPI-2, an inhibitor of TACE/ADAM17 (TNFα-converting enzyme), a metalloprotease responsible for TNFα shedding (17Crowe P.D. Walter B.N. Mohler K.M. Otten-Evans C. Black R.A. Ware C.F. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). CM was collected from LNCaP cells treated with PMA in the presence of increasing concentrations of TAPI-2, and then added to fresh LNCaP cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, pretreatment with the TACE inhibitor significantly impaired the apoptotic activity of the CM-PMA. The involvement of TACE was further confirmed using RNAi. We could achieve a 63 ± 8% reduction (n = 3) in TACE expression in LNCaP cells upon delivery of a specific TACE dsRNA (Fig. 3B). CM-PMA collected from TACE-depleted cells has indeed significantly lower apoptogenic activity (∼60% inhibition) when added to fresh LNCaP cells (Fig. 3C). To assess the involvement of TNFα we used a specific anti-TNFα neutralizing antibody, which dose-dependently impaired the ability of the CM-PMA to cause apoptosis. At a concentration of 10 mg/ml, a 48 ± 3% inhibition (n = 3) was observed (Fig. 4A). Real-time PCR assays showed that PMA treatment caused a marked increase in TNFα mRNA levels (357 ± 92-fold after 3 h, and 1992 ± 146-fold after 6 h). Because our results using cycloheximide (Fig. 1G) suggest that the effect is largely independent of protein synthesis, we believe that the contribution of newly generated TNFα is probably less important than the released of a pre-formed pool of the cytokine.FIGURE 4Involvement of TNFα in PMA-induced apoptosis.Panel A, LNCaP cells were treated with CM-PMA, either in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of a TNFα blocking antibody or a normal mouse IgG. The CM was incubated with the antibodies for 30 min and then added to the cells. The incidence of apoptosis was determined 24 h later. Data are expressed as percentage of apoptosis induced by CM-PMA in the absence of antibodies. Results are presented as mean ± S.E. (n = 3). Panel B, LNCaP cells were transfected with specific RNAi duplexes for TACE, PKCδ, or a control RNAi (48 h). Alternatively, cells were pretreated with tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor-2 (10 μm) or GF109203X (10 μm), 40 min before and during 100 nm PMA-treatment. CM-PMA or CM-vehicle were collected 24 h later, and TNFα levels were determined by ELISA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PKCδ Is Required for PMA-induced Secretion of TNFα—In the next series of experiments we explored whether PKC activation could promote the secretion of TNFα from LNCaP cells. TNFα levels in CM-PMA (as determined by ELISA) were remarkably higher compared with those in CM-vehicle (Fig. 4B). As expected, TNFα levels were significantly reduced by preincubation with the TACE inhibitor TAPI-2 as well as by TACE RNAi. The PKC inhibitor GF109703X completely blocked the secretion of TNFα caused by PMA. In LNCaP cells subject to PKCδ RNAi, there was also a marked reduction in TNFα levels in the CM upon PMA treatment. Taken together, these results support a critical role for PKCδ in phorbol ester-induced secretion of TNFα. TRAIL Is Also Involved in the PKC-mediated Autocrine Effect—Other cytokines in addition to TNFα are pro-apoptogenic in prostate cancer cells, including TRAIL and FasL (18Yu R. Mandlekar S. Ruben S.

However, whether specific targeting of glutathione biosynthesis in neurons is sufficient to trigger neurodegeneration remains undetermined. To address this issue, we used a vector-based small hairpin RNA (shRNA) strategy to knock down each subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL; γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase), the heterodimeric enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step of glutathione biosynthesis. Independent targeting of the catalytic and modulatory subunits by shRNA caused disruption of GCL as assessed by Northern and Western blotting, enzyme activity, and glutathione concentrations. Silencing each subunit in primary cortical neurons spontaneously elicited time-dependent apoptotic death, an effect that was synergistic with glutamate or nitric oxide treatment. Moreover, neuronal apoptosis by GCL knockdown was rescued by expressing the corresponding subunit full-length cDNA carrying silent mutations within the shRNA target cDNA sequence and by incubating neurons with γ-glutamylcysteine or glutathione ethyl ester. In contrast, supplying glutathione precursors to neurons from co-cultured astrocytes did not prevent the apoptotic death triggered by GCL knockdown. Finally, overexpressing the catalytic (but not modulatory) GCL subunit full-length cDNA increased enzyme activity and glutathione concentrations, yielding neurons more resistant to glutamate- or nitric oxide-mediated apoptosis. Thus, specific and independent disruption of each subunit of GCL in neurons can be said to cause a primary decrease in glutathione that is sufficient to promote neurodegeneration.

Glutathione is a critical non-protein thiol involved in antioxidant defense (1Dringen R. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 62: 649-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar) and whose loss has been associated with neurodegeneration (2Liu H. Wang H. Shenvi S. Hagen T.M. Liu R.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1019: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Thus, glutathione deficiency is the earliest known biochemical indicator of nigrostriatal degeneration in Parkinson disease (3Perry T.L. Godin D.V. Hansen S. Neurosci. Lett. 1982; 33: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), an observation suggesting that oxidative stress may be a cause of the apoptotic neuronal death associated with neurodegenerative processes and aging (2Liu H.

Unfortunately, to date, no unambiguous demonstration that the specific loss of glutathione is sufficient to trigger neurodegeneration has been reported. Glutathione is a tripeptide (γ-glutamylcysteinylglycine) synthesized by two consecutive ATP-dependent reactions.

Meister A. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This is followed by the glutathione synthetase (EC 6.3.2.3)-catalyzed reaction, which binds glycine to γ-glutamylcysteine, forming glutathione (8Huang C.S. He W. Meister A. Anderson M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1232-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). GCL is a heterodimeric enzyme composed of a catalytic subunit (heavy; 73 kDa) (9Huang C.S. Chang L.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a modulatory subunit (light; 27.7 kDa) (10Huang C.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20578-20583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies performed with purified GCL suggest that the active site resides at the catalytic subunit, whereas the modulatory subunit increases the affinity of the catalytic subunit for glutamate and decreases the sensitivity to feedback inhibition by glutathione (9Huang C.S. Chang L.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Homozygous embryonic mice with targeted disruption of the catalytic GCL subunit (Cat) have been obtained, but they are not viable beyond the 8th gestational day (11Dalton T.P. Dieter M.Z. Yang Y.

On the other hand, initial characterizations of homozygous knockout mice for the modulatory GCL subunit (Mod) revealed that they are viable and fertile, hence providing an interesting model for the in vivo study of mild and chronic glutathione deficiency (13Yang Y.

However, the biochemical, molecular, and cellular phenotypes of the brains of these mice have not yet been investigated.

J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13704-13712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, l-buthionine sulfoximine also inhibits the glutamyl amino acid transporter (15Griffith O.W. Bridges R.J. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6319-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and hence may affect other unknown biochemical pathways. An elegantly designed inducible vector-based full-length antisense cDNA approach has been described to induce a concomitant depletion of both GCL subunits in PC12 cells (16Jha N. Jurma O. Lalli G.

Such an approach requires cell lines constitutively expressing the tetracycline repressor, but is unsuitable for primary cells such as cortical neurons. In addition, this system does not afford any information about the impact of each GCL subunit on glutathione biosynthesis. With the aim of elucidating the specific contribution of each GCL subunit to glutathione biosynthesis and neuronal survival by overcoming these potential drawbacks, in this work, we used the small interfering RNA (siRNA) strategy. This system, which has been proven to be more specific and efficient than the full-length antisense cDNA strategy (18Meister G. Tuschl T. Nature. 2004; 431: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar), allowed us to identify siRNAs (delivered from a plasmid expression vector) that triggered highly specific and efficient GCL subunit protein disruption and the inhibition of enzyme activity, leading to glutathione depletion and neuronal death. We believe that these results unambiguously confirm that both GCL subunits are essential for glutathione biosynthesis and neuronal survival. Reagents—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), poly-d-lysine, horse serum, cytosine arabinoside, and glutathione ethyl ester were obtained from Sigma. DMEM was always supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (0.25 μg/ml) (Sigma). Fetal calf serum (FCS) was purchased from Roche Diagnostics (Heidelberg, Germany). The apoptosis assay kit was purchased from BD Biosciences. Lipofectamine 2000 was purchased from Invitrogen (Groningen, The Netherlands). γ-Glutamylcysteine was purchased from Bachem (Weil am Rhein, Germany). Other substrates, enzymes, and coenzymes were purchased from Sigma, Roche Diagnostics, Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), and Promega Biotech (Madrid, Spain). Plastic tissue culture flasks were purchased from Nunc (Roskilde, Denmark). Design of Small Hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) for GCL—GCL subunit knockdown was achieved by RNA interference (RNAi) using a vector-based shRNA approach (19Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). Five shRNA target cDNA sequences were selected for each GCL subunit according to a previously reported rational design protocol (see TABLE ONE) (20Reynolds A. Leake D. Boese Q. Scaringe S. Marshall W.S. Khvorova A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). As a control, we used the firefly luciferase-targeted oligonucleotide 5′-CTGACGCGGAATACTTCGA-3′ as reported previously (21Ohtsuka T. Ryu H. Minamishima Y.A. Macip S. Sagara J. Nakayama K.I. Aaronson S.A. Lee S.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). All sequences were BLAST-confirmed for specificity. Synthetic forward and reverse 64-nucleotide oligonucleotides (Isogen Life Science, Maarsen, The Netherlands) were designed, annealed, and inserted into the BglII/HindIII sites of the pSUPER-neo/GFP vector (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA) following the manufacturer's instructions. These constructions express 19-bp 9-nucleotide stem-loop shRNAs targeted against GCL, the catalytic (Cat shRNA) or modulatory (Mod shRNA) GCL subunit, or luciferase (control shRNA) mRNAs. The concomitant expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) from this vector allowed the identification of transfected cells by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry.TABLE ONEOligonucleotides (19 nucleotides) selected for siRNA against Homo sapiens GCL ORF, open reading frame.NamesiRNA target sequenceStartCriterionaSatisfies (+) or not (–) the corresponding criteria reported previously (20) for the rational design of siRNA for RNA interference12345678Catalytic subunit (accession no.

The oligonucleotides used were 5′-CCGGAATTCGCCATGGGGCTGCTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGCCAGAAGGTGATCGATGCCTT-3′ (antisense) for the 5′-end fragment and 5′-AAGGCATCGATCACCTTCTGGCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGGAATTCCAACTGGAACACTGTAG-3′ (antisense) for the 3′-end fragment (with EcoRI sites underlined). The Mod full-length cDNA (905 bp; GenBank™ accession number NM_017305) was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR of total RNA from rat astrocytes as template. The oligonucleotides used were 5′-CGCGGATCCTCCCCTCGGGCGGCAGCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGCGGATCCTAAATACAAGGCCCCTGAG-3′ (antisense) (with BamHI sites underlined). The reverse transcription-PCR conditions were as follows: 50 min at 48 °C for reverse transcription; 3 min at 94 °C; 40 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 53 °C for Cat and at 55 °C for Mod, and 2.5 min for Cat and 1 min for Mod at 68 °C; and a final extension for 10 min at 68 °C. The cDNA products were purified, digested, and subcloned into the corresponding EcoRI or BamHI site of the pIRES2-EGFP mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) (pIRES-Cat or pIRES-Mod) and sequenced. The concomitant expression of GFP from this vector allowed the identification of transfected cells by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Site-directed Mutagenesis—To assess whether the shRNA procedure was specific, wild-type (Cat or Mod) or mutant (Cat-mut or Mod-mut) forms of the rat catalytic or modulatory GCL subunit full-length cDNA were used. Cat-mut and Mod-mut were obtained by PCR site-directed mutagenesis using pIRES-Cat and pIRES-Mod, respectively, as template, followed by DpnI digestion (QuikChange XL, Stratagene). The selected PCR forward and reverse 50-nt oligonucleotides carried silent third codon base point mutations within the rat cDNA-corresponding Cat-d and Mod-c shRNA target sequences (5′-GAAAGAAGCCACGTCAGTT-3′ for Cat and 5′-GGCATCGCCACCTATCGAG-3′ for Mod; with mutated nucleotides underlined). Antibodies against the Catalytic and Modulatory GCL Subunits— Polyclonal antibodies against the catalytic and modulatory subunits of rat GCL were obtained by rabbit immunization with synthetic peptides (Mimotopes Pty. Ltd., Clayton, Victoria, Australia). The peptides were 16QRHADHVRRHGILQ29 for the catalytic subunit and 229EALQESIPDIEAQE242 for the modulatory subunit. Rabbits were immunized with 100 ng of the peptides coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin according to the procedure described by Sambrook et al. (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To improve the detection of the proteins, antibodies were purified from the antisera by affinity chromatography using columns of cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose coupled to the peptides. Neurons in Primary Culture—Cerebral cortex neurons in primary culture were prepared from fetal Wistar rats at 16 days of gestation (23Almeida A. Moncada S. Bolaños J.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Dissociated cell suspensions were plated at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/cm2 in 6- or 12-well plates previously coated with poly-d-lysine (15 μg/ml) in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air. Forty-eight hours after plating, the medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 5% horse serum, 20 mm d-glucose, and 10 μm cytosine arabinoside to prevent non-neuronal proliferation. Neurons were transfected on day 5, when ∼99% of the cells were microtubule-associated protein-2-positive. Astrocytes in Primary Culture—Astrocytes in primary culture were prepared from the forebrains of neonatal rats (24 h old). Cell suspensions were seeded at a density of 1.2 × 105 cells/cm2 in 175-cm2 flasks in culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS). Cells were incubated at 37 °C under a humidified 5% CO2-containing atmosphere for 12 days, after which time >85% of the cells were astrocytes and the remaining proportion was microglia and progenitor cells as assessed by immunocytochemistry (23Almeida A. Moncada S. Bolaños J.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Neuron-Astrocyte Co-culture—Twenty-four h before the co-culture experiments, astrocytes were trypsinized and reseeded at 1.2 × 105 cells/cm2 in Millicell-PCF cell culture inserts (4.2 cm2 of effective membrane area, 0.4-μm membrane pore size; Millipore Corp. Bedford, MA). To co-incubate astrocytes with neurons, astrocytes previously seeded in the cell culture inserts were placed on top of the neuronal cultures and bathed in DMEM (24Bolaños J.P. Heales S.J. Peuchen S. Barker J.E. Land J.M. Clark J.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). After 24 h of incubation, the inserts were removed, and the neurons were washed and used for the determination of either glutathione concentrations or apoptotic cell death. When necessary, neurons were transfected with the appropriate plasmid vectors 6 h before co-incubation. Human Embryonic Kidney 293T (HEK293T) Cells—HEK293T cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS. Cells were reseeded at 105 cells/cm2 1 day before transfections, after which FCS was reduced to 0.5% (v/v). Cell Treatments—Cell transfections were performed with pSUPER-neo/GFP- or pIRES2-EGFP-derived plasmid constructions using Lipofectamine 2000 following the manufacturer's instructions. After 6 h, the medium was removed, and cells were further incubated for the indicated time periods in the presence of culture medium. To activate glutamate receptors, 24 h after transfections, neurons were incubated with 100 μm glutamate (plus 10 μm glycine) in buffered Hanks' solution (5.26 mm KCl, 0.43 mm KH2H2PO4, 132.4 mm NaCl, 4.09 mm NaHCO3, 0.33 mm Na2HPO4,20mm glucose, 2 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). After 5 min, when glutamate receptors were activated (25Almeida A. Bolaños J.P. J.

To expose the transfected cells to nitric oxide, they were incubated in buffered Hanks' solution containing (Z)-1-[2-aminoethyl-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (DETA/NO; Alexis Biochemicals) at 0.5 mm, a concentration seen to release continuously ∼1.4 μm nitric oxide at 37 °C, as measured using a nitric oxide-sensitive electrode (World Precision Instruments), for the indicated time periods. To ensure immediate exposure of the cells to nitric oxide, all DETA/NO-containing solutions were always preincubated in buffered Hanks' solution at 37 °C for 20 min before addition to the cells (23Almeida A. Moncada S. Bolaños J.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 26Almeida A. Almeida J. Bolaños J.P. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15294-15299Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Northern Blotting—Total RNA samples were purified (GenElute mammalian total RNA miniprep kit, Sigma) and electrophoresed (10 μg of RNA/line) on a formaldehyde-containing 1% (w/v) agarose gel. After transfer to a GeneScreen Plus membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and cross-linking by ultraviolet irradiation, membranes were hybridized for 18 h at 65 °C in the presence of the appropriate random-primed [α-32P]dCTP-radiolabeled cDNA probe (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film. We used the cDNA probes against rat Cat or Mod. A 0.7-kb cDNA fragment of the rat cyclophilin gene (generously donated by Dr. Dionisio Martín-Zanca, University of Salamanca) was used as a control of the amount of total RNA loaded onto each lane. Autoradiograms were scanned and quantified using NIH Image software. The scanned mRNA autoradiograms were expressed as a ratio versus cyclophilin mRNA. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed for 20 min at 4 °C in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml antipapain, 50 μg/ml pepstatin, 50 μg/ml amastatin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml bestatin, 1 mmo-vanadate, 50 mm NaF, and 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and aliquots containing 100 μg of protein from each sample, as determined extemporarily with the BCA™ protein assay kit (Pierce) using albumin as a standard and the BenchMark™ prestained protein ladder (Invitrogen), were subjected to SDS-PAGE on an 8% (catalytic subunit) or 12% (modulatory subunit) acrylamide gel (Mini-PROTEAN®, Bio-Rad). The resolved proteins were transferred electro-phoretically to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-ECL, Amersham Bioscience Europe GmbH, Barcelona, Spain). Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) low-fat milk in 20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20, pH 7.5, for 1 h. GCL immunoblotting was performed using the anti-catalytic and anti-modulatory subunit antibodies that we raised (see above) at dilutions of 1:20 and 1:5, respectively. Anti-phosphofructokinase-1 antibody (1:500 dilution) was used as a loading control (23Almeida A. Moncada S. Bolaños J.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and immediately incubated with SuperSignal West Dura (Pierce) for 5 min before exposure to Kodak XAR-5 film for 1-3 min. Autoradiograms were scanned, quantified using NIH Image software, and expressed as a ratio versus phosphofructokinase-1. GCL Activity—For the determination of GCL activity, we followed the method of Gegg et al. (27Gegg M.E. Clark J.B. Heales S.J. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 304: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In brief, 24 h after transfections, cells were washed, harvested by mild trypsinization, pelleted, and resuspended in isolation medium (320 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Cell suspensions were freeze-thawed three times, and the lysates were filtered through 10-kDa molecular mass cutoff devices (Amicon, Inc., and Millipore Corp.) at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The retained protein fraction was immediately assayed for GCL activity in 0.1 m Tris-HCl containing 0.15 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2,2mm EDTA, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm l-cysteine, 40 mm l-glutamate, and 220 μm acivicin, pH 8.2, at 37 °C for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of ice-cold orthophosphoric acid (15 mm), and the reaction product was immediately used for γ-glutamylcysteine determination by high pressure liquid chromatography (Beckman Instruments) with electrochemical detection (ESA Biosciences, Inc., Chelmsford, MA) using a Techsphere ODS column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5-μm particle size) and 15 mm orthophosphoric acid as the mobile phase (27Gegg M.E. Clark J.B. Heales S.J. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 304: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). An external standard of γ-glutamylcysteine (2.5-10 μm) was used for the calculations. Preliminary experiments showed that, under these conditions, γ-glutamylcysteine synthesis was linear with the incubation time at least up to 20 min. Glutathione Concentrations—Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and immediately scraped off the plastic with 1% (w/v) sulfosalicylic acid. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were used for the determination of total glutathione concentrations (GSH + 2× GSSG) on the same day using GSSG as a standard (0-50 μm) as described previously (28Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5556) Google Scholar, 29Dringen R. Hamprecht B. J.

Flow Cytometric Analysis of Apoptotic Cell Death—Allophycocyanin-conjugated annexin V and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) (BD Biosciences) were used to quantitatively determine the percentage of apoptotic cells by flow cytometry. Cells were stained with allophycocyanin-conjugated annexin V and 7-AAD following the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (15-milliwatt argon ion laser tuned at 488 nm; CellQuest software, BD Biosciences). Both GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells were analyzed separately, and the allophycocyanin-conjugated annexin V-stained cells that were 7-AAD-negative were considered apoptotic (23Almeida A. Moncada S. Bolaños J.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Measurements from individual cultures were always performed in triplicate. The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. for three different culture preparations. Statistical analysis of the results was performed by one-way analysis of variance, followed by the least significant difference multiple range test. In all cases, p < 0.05 was considered significant. Design, Expression, and Efficacy of shRNAs against the Catalytic and Modulatory GCL Subunits—To promote the specific silencing of GCL, five 19-nucleotide sequences were designed for each subunit according to a recently reported rational criterion for RNAi design for siRNA (20Reynolds A. Leake D. Boese Q. Scaringe S. Marshall W.S. Khvorova A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). These sequences were selected using the human GCL cDNA template within regions that were best conserved in rat (GenBank™ accession numbers NM_012815 (Cat) and NM_017305 (Mod)) and mouse (accession numbers NM_010295 (Cat) and NM_008129 (Mod)). Only those sequences that fulfilled at least six criteria were selected; these are shown in TABLE ONE. These sequences were subcloned into a GFP cDNA-coexpressing pSUPER-neo/GFP mammalian expression vector (19Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar) to promote the expression of the corresponding shRNA molecules. The use of such an expression vector allows the specific and independent siRNA-mediated silencing of GCL subunits via the Dicer-triggered cleavage of shRNAs (18Meister G. Tuschl T. Nature. 2004; 431: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar). To investigate the efficacy of the shRNA procedure, we obtained antibodies raised against the rat catalytic and modulatory GCL subunits. These antibodies proved to be highly specific, as revealed by the appearance of a single band of the expected size in rat kidney extracts by Western blotting (Fig. 1A). Because the endogenous GCL (Cat and Mod) protein levels were too low to be detectable by Western blotting in cultured cells (data not shown), we estimated the efficacy of the selected shRNAs by assaying their ability to interfere with the respective expressed proteins. To accomplish this, we first obtained the full-length cDNAs for both the catalytic and modulatory GCL subunits by reverse transcription-PCR, and these were subcloned into the GFP cDNA-coexpressing pIRES mammalian expression vector. The expression of these plasmids in HEK293T cells afforded proteins with the expected corresponding catalytic or modulatory GCL subunit sizes (Fig. 2B). The expression of five different shRNAs for each GCL subunit in HEK293T cells differentially disrupted the expression of the corresponding"

In addition to providing a physical barrier against invasion, fibrillar collagen also restricts cell proliferation. It has been assumed that the growth regulatory activity of fibrillar collagen is the result of an indirect restrictive effect on cell spreading and cytoskeletal organization. Here we provide evidence for a direct inhibitory effect of fibrillar collagen on proliferation of human melanoma and fibrosarcoma cells that involves activation of the tyrosine kinase discoidin domain receptor 2 and is independent of effects on cell spreading. Cells plated in the presence of fibrillar collagen were growth arrested in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. However treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, down-regulation of discoidin domain receptor 2, or collagen deglycosylation that prevents discoidin domain receptor 2 activation allowed cells to enter the cell cycle in the presence of fibrillar collagen without a requirement for spreading and actin organization. Our data provide evidence for a novel direct mechanism by which cell contact with fibrillar collagen restricts proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W1986912066,"Kinetic adaptation of muscle and non-muscle myosins plays a central role in defining the unique cellular functions of these molecular motor enzymes. The unconventional vertebrate class VII myosin, myosin VIIb, is highly expressed in polarized cells and localizes to highly ordered actin filament bundles such as those found in the microvilli of the intestinal brush border and kidney. We have cloned mouse myosin VIIb from a cDNA library, expressed and purified the catalytic motor domain, and characterized its actin-activated ATPase cycle using quantitative equilibrium and kinetic methods. The myosin VIIb steady-state ATPase activity is slow (∼1 s-1), activated by very low actin filament concentrations (KATPase ∼ 0.7 μm), and limited by ADP release from actomyosin. The slow ADP dissociation rate constant generates a long lifetime of the strong binding actomyosin·ADP states. ADP and actin binding is uncoupled, which enables myosin VIIb to remain strongly bound to actin and ADP at very low actin concentrations. In the presence of 2 mm ATP and 2 μm actin, the duty ratio of myosin VIIb is ∼0.8. The enzymatic properties of actomyosin VIIb are suited for generating and maintaining tension and favor a role for myosin VIIb in anchoring membrane surface receptors to the actin cytoskeleton. Given the high conservation of vertebrate class VII myosins, deafness phenotypes arising from disruption of normal myosin VIIa function are likely to reflect a loss of tension in the stereocilia of inner ear hair cells.

Given the high conservation of vertebrate class VII myosins, deafness phenotypes arising from disruption of normal myosin VIIa function are likely to reflect a loss of tension in the stereocilia of inner ear hair cells. Members of the myosin family of molecular motors use the chemical energy from ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product release to generate mechanical force, tension, and motility (work output) along actin filaments (1Geeves M.A. Fedorov R. Manstein D.J. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 1462-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The myosin family consists of at least 18 classes that share a highly homologous catalytic motor domain that binds actin filaments, hydrolyzes ATP, and generates force.Although all myosins examined to date share a similar ATPase cycle mechanism, variations in the overall cycling rate, the degree of coupling between the nucleotide- and actin-binding sites, and the lifetimes and distribution of populated biochemical intermediates introduce unique properties to the motor and contribute to the diversity of myosin family members (2De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Slow cycling myosins have adapted for slow contractions and tension generation and maintenance, whereas fast cycling myosins are capable of generating rapid contractions and transport (2De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Myosins IIb, V, and VI spend a significant fraction (40 to >90%) of their cycle time bound strongly to actin at physiological nucleotide concentrations due to a high ADP binding affinity and, in some cases, slow rate-limiting ADP release (3De La Cruz E.M.

A high duty ratio enables myosins to maintain tension (5Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Chen L.Q. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol.

In this study, we provide the complete kinetic mechanism of the mouse myosin VIIb catalytic motor domain. This is the first complete kinetic characterization of a vertebrate class VII myosin. Our results demonstrate that myosin VIIb is a high duty ratio motor with weak thermodynamic coupling between ADP and actin binding, favoring a role for class VII myosins in anchoring cellular structures and membrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—All chemicals and reagents were the highest purity commercially available.

The following primers were used to clone myosin VIIb-1IQ (subfragment 1-like) by PCR: primer 1 (MyoVIIb-5′), 5′-ATGTCCGTGTTCCGGCTGGG; and primer 2 (MyoVIIb-1IQ-3′), 5′-CCTGTACTTGTGTCCCCGGAG. DNA sequencing confirmed the identity of the PCR product as the mouse myosin VIIb gene product (GenBank™ accession number NM_032394). The purified fragment encoding residues 1-773 of myosin VIIb was cloned into the pFastBac Dual vector (Invitrogen) carrying calmodulin cDNA in the p10 promoter, and the myosin VIIb-1IQ cDNA, with a FLAG sequence at its C terminus, was cloned into the polyhedrin promoter region.Protein Expression and Purification—Single-headed mouse myosin VIIb with bound calmodulin (referred to as myosin VIIb) was purified from Sf9 cells by FLAG affinity chromatography (7Robblee J.P.

Biol. 2004; 11: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar).Steady-state ATPase Activity—The actin-activated steady-state ATPase activity of myosin VIIb was measured at 25 ± 0.1 °C in KMg50 buffer supplemented with 2 mm MgATP using the NADH coupled assay (12De La Cruz E.M. Sweeney H.L. Ostap E.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1524-1529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The myosin VIIb concentration was 50-150 nm. Essentially identical results were obtained by monitoring changes in absorption (λ = 340 nm) or fluorescence through a 400-nm colored glass emission filter. Time courses of single turnover ATPase activity in the absence of actin were measured using ATP and mant-ATP.Stopped-flow Measurements—All experiments were performed in KMg50 buffer with an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV-R stopped-flow apparatus thermostatted at 25 ± 0.1 °C. The concentrations stated are final concentrations after mixing. Pyrene (λex = 366 nm) and mant-nucleotide (λex = 280, 297, or 366 nm) fluorescence was monitored at 90° through a 400-nm long-pass colored glass filter. Long time courses were corrected for minor contributions from photobleaching (7Robblee J.P. Olivares A.O. De La Cruz E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38608-38617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (λex = 280 or 297 nm) was measured through a Schott 320WG filter. Light scattering was measured at 90° with excitation at 313 nm. Most time courses shown are of individual, unaveraged, 1000-point transients collected with the instrument in oversampling mode, where the intrinsic time constant for data acquisition is ∼30 μs. Typically, multiple (four to eight) time courses were averaged before analysis. Time courses displayed fast and slow phases were collected on a logarithmic or split time scale.Using Pro-K software provided with the instrument or with Kaleida-Graph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA), time courses of fluorescence change were fitted to a sum of exponentials (Equation 1), F(t)=F∞+∑i=1nAie−kit(Eq. 1) where F(t) is the fluorescence at time t, F∞ is the final fluorescence intensity, Ai is the amplitude, ki is the observed rate constant characterizing the ith relaxation process, and n is the total number of observed relaxations. The value of n was either one (single exponential) or two (double exponential). The dead time of the instrument determined from the reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol with ascorbic acid in absorbance mode was <2 ms. Fitting was limited to data beyond 3 ms to account for the instrument dead time and to exclude data acquired during the continuous flow phase of mixing as recommended by the manufacturer.Uncertainties are reported as standard errors in the fits unless stated otherwise and were propagated using the general formula (Equation 2), da=(∂a∂x1dx1)2+…+(∂a∂xndxn)2(Eq. 2) where the experimental measurements x1, x2... xn have uncertainties dx1, dx2... dxn and a is a function of x1, x2... xn.Nucleotide Binding Kinetics—Time courses of nucleotide binding were acquired under pseudo first-order conditions with [nucleotide] ≫ [myosin or actomyosin]. Actomyosin samples were prepared by mixing myosin VIIb with 1 molar eq of actin filaments or, where specified, with [actin] ≫ [myosin VIIb]. Concentrated myosin and actomyosin samples were treated with apyrase (0.2 unit/ml, potato grade VII) and equilibrated on ice for 5 min before >100-fold dilution to the experimental concentrations. The final apyrase concentration after mixing was ≤0.001 unit/ml.Apyrase has been used to deplete ATP and ADP from actin monomers (30De La Cruz E.M. Mandinova A. Steinmetz M.O. Stoffler D. Aebi U. Pollard T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which bind ADP with a ≫100-fold affinity (Kd = 0.1-1 nm) (31De La Cruz E.M. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5452-5461Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) compared with myosin VIIb and actomyosin VIIb. In addition, the observation that time courses of ATP binding follow single exponentials (data presented below) indicates that all myosin and actomyosin samples were free of bound nucleotides. If some fraction of the myosin had ADP bound, time courses would follow double exponentials, with a fast phase for ATP binding and a slow phase limited by ADP release.Actin Binding Kinetics—Time courses of myosin VIIb and myosin VIIb·ADP binding to pyrene-labeled actin filaments were measured under pseudo first-order conditions with [actin] ∼10 times greater than [myosin]. To ensure rigor (no nucleotide) conditions, concentrated myosin and actomyosin samples were treated with apyrase. Apyrase was omitted when ADP was present.Transient Phosphate Release—Transient Pi release was measured using a fluorescently labeled mutant (32Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) of the PiBiP with the instrument in sequential mixing mode (33White H.D. Belknap B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11828-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Myosin VIIb was mixed with ATP under multiple turnover conditions (final concentrations of 2 μm myosin and 30 μm MgATP), aged for 200 ms to 10 s to allow ATP binding and hydrolysis to occur, and then rapidly mixed with a range of actin filament concentrations. PiBiP (10 μm) was included in the myosin, nucleotide, and actin solutions. Background Pi was removed from all solutions, syringes, and the instrument by incubation with 7-methylguanosine (0.2 mm) and purine-nucleoside phosphorylase (0.1 unit/ml).There was an ∼5-fold enhancement of the fluorescence of PiBiP with Pi binding (λex = 430 nm, 455-nm long-pass emission filter). The rate and equilibrium constants of Pi binding to 7-diethylamino-3-((((2-maleimidyl)ethyl)amino)carbonyl)coumarin-labeled PiBiP under our experimental conditions (KMg50 buffer and 25 °C) are as follows: k+ = 117 ± 8 μm-1 s-1, k- = 24 s-1, and Kd = 0.20 μm (data not shown).Equilibrium Constant for ATP Hydrolysis—We measured the equilibrium constant for ATP hydrolysis in the absence of actin using [γ-32P]ATP (4De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 33White H.D. Belknap B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11828-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Measurements were done under multiple (250 μm ATP and 4 μm myosin VIIb) and single (3 μm ATP and 4 μm myosin) turnover conditions. The reaction was terminated after ∼3-5 s with quench solution (2 n HCl and 0.35 m NaH2PO4), and [γ-32Pi] was extracted with activated charcoal and measured by scintillation counting.Kinetic Modeling—Simulations of reaction time courses were performed with Tenua (provided by Dr. D. Wachsstock; available at www.geocities.com/tenua4java/), which is based on the kinetic simulation program KINSIM developed by Frieden and co-workers (34Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar).RESULTSActin-activated Steady-state ATPase Activity—Actin enhanced the steady-state ATPase activity of myosin VIIb (Fig. 2) by ∼60-fold from ∼0.02 s-1 (νo) to 1.17 ± 0.03 s-1 (kcat). Single turnover measurements with ATP and mant-ATP yielded a turnover rate in the absence of actin of 0.03 s-1 and confirmed that ≥90% of the myosin VIIb in our preparations was active. Actin activation of the steady-state ATPase rate follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The Km for actin (KATPase) calculated from the fit to a hyperbola is 0.66 ± 0.08 μm. Parameters varied <20% between different preparations.FIGURE 2Steady-state ATPase activity of myosin VIIb. Shown is the actin filament concentration dependence of the myosin VIIb steady-state turnover velocity. The solid line through the data points is the best fit to a rectangular hyperbola (velocity = νo + (kcat[actin])/(Km + [actin])). Error bars are within the symbols. Inset, same data shown over a shorter range.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ATP Binding to Myosin VIIb—ATP binding to myosin VIIb was measured by the enhancement of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and by energy transfer from bound mant-nucleotide to myosin VIIb tryptophan(s). Time courses of fluorescence change after mixing myosin VIIb with ATP follow single exponentials (Fig. 3), with observed rate constants (kobs) that depend hyperbolically on [ATP]. ATP binding to myosin VIIb was therefore modeled as a two-step reaction mechanism (Scheme 1), with formation of a collision complex (M(ATP)) in rapid equilibrium (K1T) with free myosin and ATP, followed by isomerization to a high fluorescence complex (M*ATP).

The intercept is indistinguishable from the origin, so ATP binding is essentially irreversible (k+2T ≫ k-2T ∼ 0). The second-order association rate constant for ATP binding (K1Tk+2T) is 4.1 ± 0.9 μm s-1. The observed rate constants of 2′-deoxy-mant-ATP binding (Fig. 3B, inset) are linear over the range examined (5-20 μm) and yield K1mTk+2mT = 1.8 ± 0.1 μm-1 s-1 (Fig. 3B). The intercept is indistinguishable from the origin, confirming that, like ATP binding, mant-ATP binding is essentially irreversible. Because we were interested primarily in defining the intercept value, low mant-ATP concentrations were examined.Myosin VIIb has a tryptophan at position 484, analogous to Dictyostelium myosin II tryptophan 501, which increases fluorescence at the conformational change preceding ATP hydrolysis (35Zeng W. Conibear P.B. Dickens J.L. Cowie R.A. Wakelin S. Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Bagshaw C.R. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2004; 359: 1843-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that the observed rate constant for maximum fluorescence change reports the conformational change in myosin VIIb that precedes and limits ATP hydrolysis.Equilibrium Constant for ATP Hydrolysis—Myosin VIIb (in the absence of actin) mixed with [γ-32P]ATP yields a Pi burst amplitude (B) of 0.48 Pi/myosin. The equilibrium constant for ATP hydrolysis in the absence of actin (KH) estimated from B = KH/(1 + KH) is 0.94 (TABLE ONE and Scheme 2). A comparable KH was obtained when [myosin] > [ATP].TABLE ONESummary of actomyosin VIIb ATPase cycle rate and equilibrium constantsParameterValueSignalATP binding and hydrolysis 1/K1T (μm)77 ± 16Tryptophan fluorescence k+2T (s−1)318 ± 23Tryptophan fluorescence K1Tk+2T (μm−1 s−1)4.1 ± 0.9Tryptophan fluorescence1.8 ± 0.1mant-ATP 1/K1T′ (μm)657 ± 61Pyrene-actin646 ± 100Light scattering k+2T′ (s−1)942 ± 35Pyrene-actin729 ± 46Light-scattering K1T′k+2T′ (μm−1 s−1)1.4 ± 0.1Pyrene-actin1.1 ± 0.2Light-scattering KH0.94[γ-32P]ATP k+H + k−H (s−1)318 ± 23Tryptophan fluorescence k+H (s−1)164Calc from KH and k+H + k−H k−H (s−1)154Calc from KH and k+H + k−HADP binding 1/K1D′ (μm)62.8 ± 8.1Pyrene-actin k+2D′ (s−1)326 ± 8Pyrene-actin k−2D′ (s−1)1.52 ± 0.02Pyrene-actin K2D′ = k+2D′/k−2D′214 ± 2Pyrene-actin K1D′k+2D′ (μm−1 s−1)5.2 ± 0.7Pyrene-actin 1/K1D′ K2D′ = KD,overall′ (μm)0.30 ± 0.037Pyrene-actinPi release k−Pi (s−1)0.02PiBiP k−Pi′ (s−1)>100PiBiPActin binding 1/K1A (μm)3.8 ± 0.8Pyrene-actin k+2A (s−1)45.8 ± 3.8Pyrene-actin k−2A (s−1)0.054 ± 0.0002Pyrene-actin K2A = k+2A/k−2A848 ± 67Pyrene-actin K1Ak+2A (μm−1 s−1)12.1 ± 2.7Pyrene-actin 1/K1AK2A (nm)4.5 ± 1.0Pyrene-actin 1/K1AD (μm)2.8 ± 1.0Pyrene-actin k+2AD (s−1)45.6 ± 6.0Pyrene-actin k−2AD (s−1)0.043 ± 0.0001Pyrene-actin K2AD = k+2AD/k−2AD1060 ± 158Pyrene-actin K1ADk+2AD (μm−1 s−1)16.3 ± 6.0Pyrene-actin 1/K1ADK2AD (nm)2.6 ± 1.0Pyrene-actin k+APi′ (μm−1 s−1)5.9 ± 0.2PiBiP Open table in a new tab SCHEME 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Binding to Actin Filaments—By equilibrium titration, myosin VIIb binds actin strongly and quenches the pyrene fluorescence by ∼50% in the absence of nucleotides or with bound ADP.

In exploring the role of nucleolar protein MCRS1 (microspherule protein1)/MSP58 (58-kDa microspherule protein), we found that Mi-2β, a component of a nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, RET finger protein (RFP), and upstream binding factor (UBF) were associated with MCRS1. Yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that MCRS1 bound to the ATPase/helicase region of Mi-2β and the coiled-coil region of RFP. Interestingly, confocal microscopic analyses revealed the co-localization of MCRS1, Mi-2β, RFP, and the rRNA transcription factor UBF in the nucleoli. We also found that MCRS1, Mi-2β, and RFP were associated with rDNA using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Finally, we showed that MCRS1, Mi-2β, and RFP up-regulated transcriptional activity of the rDNA promoter and that ribosomal RNA transcription was repressed when MCRS1, Mi-2β, and RFP expression was reduced using siRNA. These results indicated that Mi-2β and RFP, known to be involved in transcriptional repression in the nucleus, co-localize with MCRS1 in the nucleolus and appear to activate the rRNA transcription.

The nucleolus is a subnuclear compartment in eukaryotic cells responsible for rRNA synthesis and ribosome biogenesis. In actively growing animal and plant cells, rRNA synthesis accounts for about 50-80% of total cellular RNA production (1Raska I. Koberna K. Malinsky J. Fidlerova H. Masata M. Biol. Cell. 2004; 96: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Human diploid cells contain about 400 ribosomal genes organized as tandem repeats at nucleolus organizer regions encoded on chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22 (1Raska I. Koberna K. Malinsky J.

In addition, growing evidence indicates roles for different histone modification and chromatin remodeling complexes in the coordinated regulation of rRNA gene transcription. Nucleolar remodeling complex (NoRC) is a well recognized chromatin remodeling complex involved in rRNA gene silencing and is known to cooperate with DNA methyltransferases, histone deacetylases, histone methyltransferases, and TTF-I (transcription terminator factor) (11Strohner R.

The transcriptional repressive activity of Mi-2 is mediated by NuRD complex components, such as methyl CpG-binding protein MBD 2/3, histone deacetylases HDAC1/2, metastasis-associated protein MTA2/3, and RbAp46/48. NuRD complex and Mi-2 have been associated with the transcriptional repressive activities of KAP-1, RET finger protein (RFP), Trk69 (Tram-track69), and RORγ (21Schultz D.C. Friedman J.R.

In addition, MTA-3, another component of the NuRD complex, was reported to repress Snail expression, and the estrogen-dependent transcriptional control of MTA3, Snail, and E-cadherin was associated with breast cancer progression (25Fujita N.

However, Mi-2 also plays roles in transactivation outside the NuRD complex. A transactivating role of dMi-2 was suggested in studies of Drosophila salivary glands that showed the localization of dMi-2 to chromatin puffs (26Hirose F. Ohshima N. Kwon E.J. Yoshida H. Yamaguchi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5182-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We recently reported that Mi-2β possessed both transactivating and repressing subdomains (24Shimono Y.

Furthermore, the study, based on a conditional Mi-2β knock-out mouse line, clearly showed that Mi-2β activated CD4 transcription in T cells by forming a complex with p300 histone acetyltransferase and the E box-binding protein HEB (27Williams C.J.

RFP contains a tripartite motif consisting of a RING finger, a B-box zinc finger, a coiled-coil domain that is involved in protein-protein associations, and an RFP domain. RFP is a nuclear protein and was reported to partially co-localize with promyelocytic leukemia protein and int-6 in the nucleus (30Morris-Desbois C. Bochard V. Reynaud C. Jalinot P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3331-3342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Cao T. Duprez E. Borden K.L. Freemont P.S. Etkin L.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1319-1329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that RFP exhibited transcriptional repressive activity and that it was associated and co-localized with Enhancer of Polycomb 1 and Mi-2β in the nucleus (24Shimono Y. Murakami H. Kawai K.

We also showed that the subnuclear distribution of RFP was altered by small ubiquitin-like modifier modification by protein inhibitor of activated STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) (PIAS) proteins (33Matsuura T. Shimono Y. Kawai K. Murakami H. Urano T. Niwa Y. Goto H. Takahashi M. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 308: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). MCRS1 (microspherule protein 1)/MSP58 (58-kDa microspherule protein) and the related protein p78 were originally identified as proteins that interacted with nucleolar protein p120 and herpes simplex virus 1-infected cell protein 22 (ICP22) (34Ren Y. Busch R.K. Perlaky L. Busch H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 734-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 35Bruni R. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8525-8531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MCRS1 is a nucleolar protein that contains a bipartite nuclear localization motif, a nucleolar localization motif, a coiled-coil domain, and a forkhead associated domain. Several functions for MCRS1 and its splice variant MCRS2 have been reported, including a transforming activity, nucleolar sequestration activity, and telomerase inhibition (36Bader A.G.

MCRS1 and TOJ3, a protein with high structural similarity to MCRS1, exhibit transforming activity, whereas phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) suppresses the transforming activity of MCRS1 (36Bader A.G. Schneider M.L. Bister K. Hartl M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7524-7535Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 38Okumura K. Zhao M. Depinho R.A. Furnari F.B. Cavenee W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2703-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that MCRS1 can relieve the repressor activity of Daxx, an adaptor protein that links Fas signaling to the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase pathway via a nucleolar sequestration mechanism (39Lin D.Y. Shih H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25446-25456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). MCRS2 is involved in telomere shortening by associating with telomerase (37Song H. Li Y. Chen G. Xing Z. Zhao J. Yokoyama K.K. Li T. Zhao M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 1116-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, binding and stabilization of MSP58 by transcription factor STRA13 has been observed (40Ivanova A.V. Ivanov S.V. Lerman M.L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 471-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although these findings suggest that MCRS1 may have several distinct functions, its transcriptional role in the nucleolus has not yet been fully characterized. In this report we investigated the role of MCRS1 in ribosomal gene transcription and its association and co-localization with Mi-2β and RFP in the nucleolus. Our results indicated that Mi-2β, RFP, and nucleolar protein MCRS1 were involved in ribosomal gene transcription and suggested that Mi-2 may be a candidate for the unidentified chromatin remodeling protein that establishes the euchromatin structure of ribosomal genes. Plasmids—MCRS1/MSP58 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_006337) was obtained by PCR using a human testis cDNA library as a template and sequenced. The same product was obtained using a human placenta cDNA library as a template. The full-length MCRS1 was cloned in-frame into pEGFP-C1 plasmid (Clontech). Human ribosomal DNA promoter spanning -483 to +377 bp with respect to the transcription initiation site (GenBank™ accession number U13369) (41Miesfeld R. Arnheim N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 3933-3949Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) was amplified from genomic DNA isolated from human embryo kidney (HEK) 293 cells and checked by sequencing. The internal ribosome entry site (IRES) from the encephalomyocarditis virus was amplified from pIRES2-EGFP vector (Clontech) and checked by sequencing. The Kozak sequence of the pGL3-basic vector was removed by digestion with NcoI and HindIII and replaced with the IRES sequence to generate the pGL3-IRES-Luc plasmid (42Ghoshal K. Majumder S. Datta J.

The pGL3-GAL4-hrDNAP-IRES-Luc plasmid was generated by cloning the GAL4 DNA binding region (GAL4BD) fragment of pAS2-1 vector (Clontech) and the human ribosomal DNA promoter (-483 to +377) into the pGL3-IRES-Luc plasmid. The pcDNA3-GAL4BD plasmid was described previously (32Shimono Y. Murakami H. Hasegawa Y. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39411-39419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and the nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) of MCRS1 (32-57 amino acids) was inserted right after the GAL4BD sequence to generate the pcDNA3-GAL4BD-NoLS plasmid. Antibodies—Anti-RFP polyclonal antibody was described previously (24Shimono Y. Murakami H. Kawai K. Wade P.A. Shimokata K. Takahashi M. J. Biol.

Gegonne A. Jones P.L. Ballestar E. Aubry F. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Anti-MCRS1 polyclonal antibody was developed against the 19 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of MCRS1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_006337). Anti-FLAG (M2) monoclonal antibody was obtained from Sigma. Anti-upstream binding factor (UBF) monoclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-GFP polyclonal antibody was purchased from MBL (Japan). Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes. Anti-MCRS1 polyclonal antibody was labeled with Alexa 594 using the Alexa Fluor 594 protein labeling kit (Molecular Probes). Western Blotting and Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—HEK 293 cells plated in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 4 μg of pFLAG-CMV2 expression vector or pEGFP-C1-MCRS1 expression vector using Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h of incubation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)) containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). The suspension was briefly sonicated and mixed with 160 μl of 2.5 m sucrose solution. After centrifugation at 1200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the pellet was lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm PMSF) containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture and centrifuged again at 12,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatants were incubated with specific polyclonal antibodies or mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody coupled with protein A-Sepharose or protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) for 5 h at 4°C. Co-immunoprecipitation, electrophoretic separation, and Western blotting were performed as previously described (24Shimono Y. Murakami H. Kawai K. Wade P.A. Shimokata K. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51638-51645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The nuclear/cytosol fractionation kit (Bio Vision) was used to prepare nuclear extracts to check the specificity of anti-MCRS1 antibody. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The SfiI/PmeI fragment of the pcDNAV5-HisC-HA Mi-2β full was cloned in-flame into the SfiI/SmaI site of the pAS2-1 vector (Clontech), and fragments of Mi-2β were cloned into the SfiI/SalI site of the pAS2-1 vector (24Shimono Y.

J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39411-39419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Fragments of MCRS1 were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pACT2 vector (Clontech). To characterize regions of Mi-2β and RFP that mediated binding to MCRS1, pAS2-1-Mi-2β or pAS2-1RFP constructs were co-transfected with the pACT2-MCRS1 vector into S. cerevisiae strain Y190 (Clontech). Positive interactions were determined by two criteria, expression of β-galactosidase and growth on the triple drop-out medium without tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. Measurements were performed on at least three independent colonies. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—SW480 cells were grown on coverslips and washed twice with PBS (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). To express FLAG-MCRS1, pCMV FLAG-MCRS1 vector was transfected into SW480 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were fixed with methanol (5 min, -20 °C) and acetone (30 s, -20 °C), washed 3 times with PBS, and incubated in nuclease digestion buffer (66 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.66 mm MgCl2, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/liter deoxyribonuclease I) for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing 3 times with PBS, cells were blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS and incubated with primary antibodies (1:100 dilution for anti-MCRS1 polyclonal antibody, 1:1000 for anti-RFP polyclonal antibody, 1:2500 for anti-Mi-2 antibody, 1:200 for anti-UBF antibody, and 20 μg/ml for anti-FLAG antibody), again washed 3 times in PBS, and then stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody and an Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. The Alexa 594-conjugated anti-MCRS1 antibody was diluted to 1:100 and used. To enhance the signal of the anti-MCRS1 antibody, Can Get Signal solution (Toyobo) was used. Slides were mounted in PermaFluor (Shandon) and observed using a confocal microscope (Olympus). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—After 48 h of incubation, HEK 293 cells plated in 100-mm dishes were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C and incubated with ice-cold glycine/PBS (125 mm glycine, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin in PBS) for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). After scraping and collecting cells by centrifugation at 500 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, cell pellets were resuspended in 300 μl of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) and incubated for 10 min on ice. Cell lysates were sonicated briefly 4 times on ice to shear the DNA and diluted with 2700 μl of ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Diluted cell suspensions were precleared with 80 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose (Upstate) for 1 h at 4 °C. After a brief centrifugation, supernatant fractions were immunoprecipitated overnight with specific antibodies or control normal rabbit immunoglobulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After washing with low salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), high salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), and LiCl buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxy-cholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) and twice with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA), pellets were eluted twice with 150 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). Cross-links were then reversed by adding 12 μl of 5 m NaCl and incubated overnight at 65 °C, after which 10% of the purified DNA was amplified by PCR (30 cycles of 30 s at 96 °C, 30 s at 55 °C for 28 S ribosomal DNA, 57 °C for rDNA non-coding region, 60 °C for rDNA promoter, or 65 °C for GAPDH, and 30 s at 72 °C). PCR primer sets used were: rDNA promoter 1 (forward primer, 5′-GAGCGGTCCCTCTGCCGCGAT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AGGCGCGACCTCTCGGGCC-3′), rDNA promoter 2 (forward primer, 5′-CCCTGCGTGTGGCACGGGC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AGGAGCGCGGCCGGCTAGCC-3′), 28 S RNA (forward primer, 5′-GCGACCTCAGATCAGACGTG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CTTAACGGTTTCACGCCCTC-3′), rDNA non-coding region 1 (forward primer, 5′-TGAACGTTTCTCTTGCCGTCTCCCG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AGCAGCATCAACGCGGTTCCCCT-3′), rDNA non-coding region 2 (forward primer, 5′-GAGCCACACCTCATTCCGTGCCA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CGTCTGTTCAGCTATTTTGCAGGAGTCG-3′), and GAPDH (forward primer, 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GAGATGATGACCCTTTTGGCTC-3′). GAL4-fused Ribosomal DNA Promoter-targeted Transcription Assay—Mouse L cells were kindly provided by Dr. Kaibuchi at Nagoya University. HEK 293 cells and mouse L cells were cultured in 24-well tissue culture plates and co-transfected with 40 ng of GAL4-hrDNA promoter-IRES luciferase reporter plasmid, 40 ng of pRL-TK plasmid (Promega), and 320 ng of pcDNA3-GAL4BD Mi-2β, RFP, or MCRS1 expression plasmids with or without NoLS using Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase assays were performed as previously described (32Shimono Y. Murakami H. Hasegawa Y. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39411-39419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Co-transfection with the pRL-TK plasmid was used to normalize luciferase values. Values were expressed as the means ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments. RNA-mediated Interference—MCRS1 and Mi-2β siRNA and control siRNA (siControl non-targeting siRNA) were purchased from Dhamacon, and RFP siRNA was purchased from Qiagen. The siRNAs were transfected using X-tremeGENE siRNA transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ribosomal RNA Expression Analysis—Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), and residual DNA was digested using RNase-free DNase (Qiagen). RNA was reverse-transcribed with MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems) for 30 min at 48 °C. The resultant cDNA was amplified by PCR for 12-40 cycles of 30 s at 96 °C, 30 s at 55 °C for 28 S ribosomal RNA and 47 S/45 S ribosomal RNA or 65 °C for GAPDH, and 30 s at 72 °C. PCR primer sets used for 47 S/45 S ribosomal RNA were forward primer, 5′-CGAAGAAGCGTCGCGGGTCT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CCAAGTAGGAGAGGAGCGAGC-3′, and primer sets for 28 S ribosomal RNA and GAPDH were the same as those used for the ChIP assay. MCRS1 Interacts with Mi-2 and RFP—MCRS1 is a nucleolar protein that contains a bipartite nuclear localization motif, a nucleolar localization motif, a coiled-coil domain, and a forkhead-associated domain. MCRS1 is involved in the nucleolar sequestration of Daxx and was recently reported to have transforming activity (38Okumura K. Zhao M. Depinho R.A. Furnari F.B. Cavenee W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

In a survey of MCRS1-interacting proteins by immunoprecipitation of lysates from HEK 293 cells transfected with FLAG-MCRS1 (Fig. 1A), we repeatedly identified a 220-kDa protein that co-precipitated with FLAG-MCRS1. Because 220 kDa was consistent with the molecular mass of Mi-2 and mass spectrometric analysis of nucleolar proteins suggested the presence of Mi-2β (CHD4) in the nucleolus (44Staub E. Fiziev P. Rosenthal A. Hinzmann B. Bioessays. 2004; 26: 567-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we investigated whether Mi-2 is associated with FLAG-MCRS1. As shown in Fig. 1B, we found that Mi-2 co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-MCRS1. We then examined the possibility that RFP also interacts with MCRS1, as we had previously reported an association between Mi-2 and RFP (24Shimono Y. Murakami H. Kawai K. Wade P.A. Shimokata K. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51638-51645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed an association between RFP and MCRS1 (Fig."
https://openalex.org/W2072470959,"DDR2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase whose activating ligands are various collagens. DDR2-mediated cellular signaling has been shown to require Src activity. However, the precise mechanism underlying the Src dependence of DDR2 signaling is unknown. Here, using baculoviral co-expression of the DDR2 cytosolic domain and Src, we show that Src targets three tyrosine residues (Tyr-736, Tyr-740, and Tyr-741) in the activation loop of DDR2 for phosphorylation. This phosphorylation by Src stimulates DDR2 cis-autophosphorylation of additional tyrosine residues. In vitro Shc binding assays demonstrate that phosphotyrosines resulting from DDR2 autophosphorylation are involved in Shc binding to the DDR2 cytosolic domain. Mutating tyrosine 740 of DDR2 to phenylalanine stimulates autophosphorylation of DDR2 to an extent similar to that resulting from Src phosphorylation of DDR2. In addition, the DDR2 Y740F mutant protein displays collagen-independent, constitutively activated signaling. These findings suggest that tyrosine 740 inhibits DDR2 autophosphorylation. Collectively, our findings are consistent with the following mechanism for Src-dependent DDR2 activation and signaling: 1) ligand binding promotes phosphorylation of Tyr-740 in the DDR2 activation loop by Src; 2) Tyr-740 phosphorylation stimulates intramolecular autophosphorylation of DDR2; 3) DDR2 autophosphorylation generates cytosolic domain phosphotyrosines that promote the formation of DDR2 cytosolic domain-Shc signaling complexes.

In addition, the induction of DDR proteins is implicated in breast and ovarian cancer, and is correlated with metastasis (15Heinzelmann-Schwarz V.A. Gardiner-Garden M. Henshall S.M. Scurry J.

For the insulin and fibroblast growth factor receptors, ligand binding triggers the trans-autophosphorylation of two or three tyrosine residues in a so-called activation loop between subdomain VII and VIII of the kinase catalytic core. This phosphorylation causes a considerable change in the three-dimensional structure of the activation loop and stimulates RTK activity by providing ATP and peptide substrate unrestricted access to the active site pocket (17Hubbard S.R. Till J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar, 19Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Further autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the juxtamembrane and C-terminal region occurs by the stimulated kinase activity of these receptors (17Hubbard S.R. Till J.H. Annu. Rev.

Potential phosphatase activity notwithstanding, the appearance of tyrosine phosphorylation in DDR proteins upon ligand treatment requires hours. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of most other RTKs occurs on the order of minutes after ligand binding. The reason for this apparent kinetic difference is unclear. In addition it has been suggested that DDR2-mediated signaling requires Src tyrosine kinase activity (23Ikeda K. Wang L.H. Torres R. Zhao H. Olaso E. Eng F.J. Labrador P. Klein R. Lovett D.

In this study, we explore the precise mechanism for activation of DDR2 cytosolic signaling using in vitro analysis. Plasmid Construction—All baculoviral expression vectors were constructed using pBacPAK8 vector (Clontech). For convenient glutathione S-transferase (GST) tagging of expressed proteins, the pBacPAK8 vector was modified to contain the GST gene by subcloning a PCR-amplified cDNA fragment of GST, from pGEX4T1 plasmid having a BglII restriction site at the 5′ position and BamHI or XhoI sites at the 3′ position, into BamHI or BamHI-XhoI cutting sites in pBacPAK8 plasmid (pBacPAK 8-GST-BamHI or pBacPak 8-GST-XhoI). For the baculoviral expression vector of GST-tagged DDR2 cytosolic kinase domain (GST-DDR2 CKD), a PCR-amplified cDNA fragment covering human DDR2 from amino acids 441–815 was subcloned into the XhoI-NotI site of pBacPAK8-GST-XhoI vector. Baculoviral expression vectors of GST-tagged full-length human CDK4 (GST-CDK4), DDR1 cytosolic kinase domain (amino acids from 454–914, GST-DDR1 CKD), and full-length mouse Akt1 (GST-Akt1) were made by subcloning each PCR-amplified cDNA into a BamHI-NotI site of pBacPAK 8-GST-BamHI vector. Full-length human c-Src gene and kinase-inactive c-Src gene were PCR-amplified from the vector of pUSE human c-Src wild-type or pUSE human c-Src-negative (Upstate Biotechnology) and were subcloned into the XhoI-EcoRI site of pBacPAK 8, respectively, to obtain their baculoviral expression vectors. Mammalian expression vector bearing human full-length DDR2 under the control of the CMV promoter (CMV-DDR2) was constructed by ligating two DNA fragments of NcoI/BsrDI-digested N-terminal half and BsrDI/EcoRI-digested C-terminal half of human DDR2 cDNA amplified by PCR along with NotI/EcoRI-digested CMV-sport 6 vector DNA. The human MMP-1 promoter region from -152 to +3 was PCR-amplified from human genomic DNA prepared from HepG2 cells and subcloned into the KpnI-HindIII site of pGL2 basic vector (Promega) to generate MMP-1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter vector. The sequence of all PCR-amplified DNAs was verified by extensive sequencing. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis in GST-DDR2 CKD was performed by PCR. Briefly, to generate a baculoviral expression vector of GST-tagged kinase-defective DDR2 kinase domain (GST-DDR2 CKD-K608A), lysine 608 to alanine 608 mutation was introduced into a GST-DDR2 cytosolic domain by replacing NcoI-BamHI fragment within DDR2 cytosolic domain gene with a PCR-amplified fragment to contain the mutation of K608A from overlapping PCR technique using four primers of gccgtcaccatggacctg (forward primer containing an NcoI site), gcccggccctggatccgg (reverse primer containing a BamHI site), gtggctgtggcaatgctccga (forward primer containing a K608A mutation), and tcggagcattgccacagccac (reverse primer containing a K608A mutation). To introduce site-directed mutations to the three tyrosine residues (Tyr-736/Tyr-740 and Tyr-741) in the activation segment region of wild-type DDR2 tyrosine kinase domain or kinase-defective DDR2 tyrosine kinase domain, we PCR-amplified fourteen NcoI/BamHI fragments, seven from DDR2 CKD and seven from kinase-defective DDR2 CKD-K608A cDNA, using seven sets of primer pairs consisting of 5′-primer (actcagtgcctgccgtcacc) containing NcoI site and each of seven different 3′-primers containing each mutation as well as a BamHI site such as Y740F primer (cccggccctggatccggtaatagtcaccactgaacaggttc), Y736F primer (cccggccctggatccggtaaaagtcacc), Y471F primer (cccggccctggatccggaaatagtc), Y736/740F primer (cccggccctggatccggtaaaagtcaccactgaacaggttg), Y736F/Y741F primer (cccggccctggatccggaaatagtcaccactgaacaggtc), Y740F/Y741F primer (cccggccctggatccggaaaaagtcacc), and Y736F/Y740F/Y741F primer (cccggccctggatccggaaaaagtcaccactgaacaggttcc), respectively. Each of fourteen PCR fragments was subcloned into the NcoI/BamHI site in pBacPAK8-GST-DDR2 CKD. The K608A and Y740F mutations were introduced into the full-length DDR2 mammalian expression vector (CMV-DDR2) to generate CMV-DDR2-K608A and CMV-DDR2-Y740F expression vector by replacing the wild-type sequence with the cDNA fragment containing each corresponding mutation from the mutated GST-DDR2 CKD baculoviral expression vector. Cell Lines and Culture—Spodoptera frugiperda SF9 insect cells (Clontech) were maintained in TNM-FH insect medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml gentamycin (Sigma), and 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen) at 27 °C. HSC T6 and NIH 3T3 cells were cultured using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and SK-N-SH cells were maintained using RPMI in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum, 150 μg/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. HSC T6 and SK-N-SH cells were kindly provided by Dr. S. L. Friedman (Mount Sinai School of Medicine) and Dr. Y.-H. Seo (Medical College of Seoul National University, Korea) respectively. Baculoviral Expression and Purification of Proteins—Each generated baculoviral expression vector plasmid DNA was transfected into sf9 cells along with viral genomic DNA from a baculovirus generation kit purchased from Clontech, according to the manufacturer's manual. The viral stock was amplified to a titer of ∼108 plaque-forming units/ml. sf9 cells were infected with multiplicity of infection 10 and left for 48 h before harvest. GST-tagged DDR2 kinase domain proteins were purified using a glutathione-agarose bead affinity column and subsequent Superdex 200 prep grade gel filtration (Amersham Biosciences) by fast-protein liquid chromatography system. Infected sf9 cells from 400-ml cultures were suspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m sodium vanadate, 0.02% IGE-PAL (Sigma), a proteinase inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science) and lysed by sonication for 1 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min using a Sorval SS34 rotor (Beckmann), and the supernatant was applied to 1-ml bed volume of a glutathione-agarose bead column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.15 m NaCl buffer and washed with the column equilibration buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with 10 ml of washing buffer containing 20 mm reduced glutathione and subsequently concentrated to 1 ml using Vivaspin concentrator (Vivascience, Germany). The concentrated sample was applied to a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade column pre-equilibrated with a buffer of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, and 0.1 mm EDTA and separated with the flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using a fast-protein liquid chromatography system. The eluted GST-DDR2 kinase domain protein fractions were combined and concentrated using Vivaspin concentrator. For a brief purification of GST-tagged proteins bound to glutathione beads, infected sf9 cells were lysed in 500 μl of the lysis buffer described above by sonication and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm using microcentrifuge for 10 min. 50 μl of 50% slurry of glutathione bead was added to the supernatant, and the mixture was slowly rotated for 10 min at 4 °C. Finally the GST-tagged protein-bound bead was obtained by washing with 1× TBS for three times. Autophosphorylation and Tyrosine Kinase Activity of DDR2—To measure the autophosphorylation activity of DDR2, the reaction was performed using 200 ng of DDR2 kinase domain protein in 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01 mm ATP, and 0.2 μCi of [32P]ATP. After 15-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding a half volume of 3× Laemmli buffer with subsequent boiling for 2 min. The stopped mixture was run in 10% SDS-PAGE gel, the portion of gel containing unreacted free ATP was removed, and the remaining gel was stained using Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Sigma) and dried. The 32P radioactivity in the stained DDR2 kinase protein band was visualized by autoradiography and quantitated using a BAS 32P-image analyzer. For measuring the autophosphorylation rate (the phosphate transfer rate from ATP to DDR2 cytosolic domain), the radioactivities in the total reaction mixture and DDR2 band stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue in the SDS-PAGE gel were measured, respectively, by scintillation counting, and the transferred mole number of phosphate was calculated from the ratio of the two radioactivity values as described previously (24Kim D.-M. Yang K. Yang B.-S. Exp. Mol. Med. 2003; 35: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Measurement of DDR2 tyrosine kinase activity toward heterologous peptide substrates was performed using 100 ng of the purified kinase in 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01 mm ATP, 4 μg of peptide substrate such as histone H2B (Sigma) or poly(D4Y)n (Promega) and 0.2 μCi of [32P]ATP. After 15-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding a half volume of 30% phosphoric acid. When H2B was used as a peptide substrate, the reaction mixture was spotted onto p81 paper (Millipore). For poly(D4Y)n as a substrate, reactions were spotted on avidin-coated membrane (Promega). The spotted filter was washed with 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) five times for 10 min each, and the radioactivity of each spot was visualized and quantitated using a BAS image analyzer (Fuji). Antibodies and Immunoblotting—Phosphotyrosine-specific antibody and antibody against human DDR2 were purchased from Cell Signaling Biotechnology and abcam (UK), respectively. Human c-Src specific antibody and monoclonal antibody against Shc were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. Samples were boiled for 2 min in 1× Laemmli sample buffer and loaded in 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) and blocked by 5% skim milk in TBS for 1 h. The membrane was immunoblotted with antibodies for 2 h and subsequently washed with 1× TBS five times. Membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h, and protein bands were detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Shc Binding Assay—As a source of Shc protein, total lysate of HSC T6 cells was used. For the preparation of the lysate, 2 × 107 HSC T6 cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in 5 ml of lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 m orthovanadate, 0.02% IGE-PAL (Sigma) and a proteinase inhibitor mixture pellet (Roche Applied Science). The supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and used for Shc binding assays as follows. Various GST-DDR2 CKD proteins bound to glutathione beads were obtained as described above. For the preparation of autophosphorylated GST-DDR2 CKD bound to beads, kinase reaction mixtures containing Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm of ATP were added to the protein-bound glutathione beads, incubated at 30 °C for 15 min, and washed three times with cold 1× TBS. Mock autophosphorylation was carried using γ-S-ATP instead of ATP. For Shc binding, HSC T6 cell lysate was added to the protein-bound beads, and the mixture was slowly rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. Next, the beads were washed with cold 1× TBS for three times, and the bound proteins on the bead were eluted by boiling in 1× Laemmli buffer for 2 min. The eluted proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Western blotting using Shc-specific antibody was carried out to detect Shc protein. Transfections, MMP-1 Promoter Assay, and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay of MMP-2—1 × 105 NIH 3T3 cells were plated into 24-well dishes and left overnight. Cells were transfected with plasmid DNAs of 0.2 μg of MMP-1 promoter-Luciferase vector along with 1 μg of CMV-DDR2 (wild-type) or CMV-DDR2-Y740F or CMV-DDR2-K608A, respectively, per well using CytoPure transfection reagent (Q Biogene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h, cells were treated with 20 μg/ml type I collagen (BD Biosciences). 12 h later, cells were harvested and luciferase activity was measured (Promega). To construct stable cell lines expressing wild-type DDR2 or DDR2-Y740F, 10 μg of each expression plasmid was transfected into 106 SK-N-SH cells in a 6-well plate along with 1 μg of hygromycin resistance gene plasmid using CytoPure transfection reagent. After 48 h, transfected cells were transferred to 10-cm diameter culture dish and subject to selection with a gradual increase of hygromycin B (Invitrogen) from 200 to 600 μg/ml until visible colonies appeared. Isolated stable cell colonies were tested for the expression of transfected DDR2 by Western blotting using the antibody specific to DDR2. For measuring MMP-2 expression, 1 × 105 cells of each clone as well as parental SK-N-SH cells were plated into both of pre-collagen coated and non-coated 24-well dishes in serum-free RPMI medium and further incubated for 36 h. The culture medium from each well was harvested and tested for the level of MMP-2 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit purchased from R&D Systems according to the manufacturer's protocol. Src Phosphorylates the DDR2 Tyrosine Kinase Domain—When we expressed the human DDR2 tyrosine kinase domain (amino acids 441–815) as a GST fusion in sf9 cells by baculoviral infection, the expressed GST-DDR2 CKD did not undergo detectable tyrosine phosphorylation in sf9 cells as shown by Western blotting using phosphotyrosine-specific antibody. However, when GST-DDR2 CKD was co-expressed with human c-Src tyrosine kinase in sf9 cells, significant induction of GST-DDR2 CKD tyrosine phosphorylation was detected (Fig. 1A). Control GST-tagged proteins, including GST-CDK4, did not display detectable tyrosine phosphorylation in the same experiment (Fig. 1B), indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation occurred within the DDR2 tyrosine kinase domain. In contrast, co-expression of GST-DDR2 CKD with a kinase-negative Src did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of GST-DDR2 CKD (Fig. 1A). These data indicate that Src can specifically phosphorylate the kinase domain of DDR2. Note that, in all of these experiments, similar amounts of purified GST-DDR2 CKD were used as shown by Coomassie staining, and the expression of co-transfected Src proteins in sf9 cells was confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown). Tyrosine phosphorylation by Src shows some specificity toward the DDR2 kinase domain among other tested kinases, including the human DDR1b kinase domain (amino acids 454–913), human CDK4, and murine Akt1 (Fig. 1B). When GST-tagged forms of each of these kinases were co-expressed with Src in sf9 cells, Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of GST-CDK4 and GST-Akt1 was undetectable, and such phosphorylation of GST-DDR1b CKD was much weaker than Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of GST-DDR2 CKD (Fig. 1B). Similar amounts of each GST-tagged kinase were used in these experiments, and the identity of each purified protein was confirmed by Western blotting with specific antibodies (data not shown). To determine whether the GST-DDR2 CKD tyrosine phosphorylation we detected upon Src co-expression was due to Src activity, GST-DDR2 CKD autophosphorylation, or both, a parallel experiment was performed with a GST-tagged kinase-defective mutant of the DDR2 kinase domain (kd-GST-DDR2 CKD). This kinase-defective mutant was generated by converting lysine 608, a conserved catalytic amino acid in the active site, to alanine. This point mutation completely abolished the tyrosine kinase activity of the purified protein (data not shown). After co-expression with Src in sf9 cells, the kd-GST-DDR2 CKD protein displayed considerably lesser tyrosine phosphorylation than GST-DDR2 CKD, but tyrosine phosphorylation of kd-GST-DDR2 CKD was not abolished (Fig. 1C). This finding suggested that initial tyrosine phosphorylation of the DDR2 tyrosine kinase domain by Src occurs, and this in turn stimulates autophosphorylation of the DDR2 tyrosine kinase domain. The purified c-Src could phosphorylate the purified kd-GST-DDR2 CKD protein in an in vitro phosphorylation reaction as well (data not shown). This is consistent with the idea that Src directly phosphorylates the DDR2 tyrosine kinase domain in our sf9 co-expression experiments. Tyrosine Phosphorylation by Src Stimulates the Autophosphorylation Activity of DDR2 and Its Tyrosine Kinase Activity toward Exogenous Substrates—To explore the functional significance of the observed DDR2 CKD phosphorylation by Src, we tested whether this modification stimulates the autophosphorylation activity of DDR2. To obtain tyrosine-phosphorylated GST-DDR2 CKD by Src (GST-DDR2 CKD-pY), sf9 cells were co-infected with baculoviruses encoding Src and GST-DDR2 CKD. In preliminary experiments, when the ratio of Src to GST-DDR2 CKD baculoviral titers was 1:3 or greater, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation in a specific amount of co-expressed GST-DDR2 CKD remained constant (data not shown). Therefore, we reasoned that saturation of GST-DDR2 CKD tyrosine phosphorylation by Src could be achieved by co-infecting the viruses in a ratio of 1:1 with a multiplicity of infection of 10. Expressed GST-DDR2 CKD was purified in to excess of 90% using glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography and a subsequent Superdex 200 fast-protein liquid chromatography. Src protein was undetectable in the purified GST-DDR2 CKD-pY, as judged by Western blotting (data not shown). Unphosphorylated GST-DDR2 CKD was purified from sf9 cells in the same manner after 2 days of baculovirus infection with only GST-DDR2 CKD. Following the purifications outlined above, the autophosphorylation activities of Src phosphorylated DDR2 (GST-DDR2 CKD-pY) and non-Src phosphorylated DDR2 (GST-DDR2 CKD) were assayed in kinase reactions containing [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were carried out at 4 °C for 4 h or at 30 °C for 30 min. Non-Src-phosphorylated GST-DDR2 CKD displayed negligible autophosphorylation at 4 °C and weak autophosphorylation at 30 °C. In contrast, the autophosphorylation activity of Src-phosphorylated GST-DDR2 CKD-pY was increased ∼3-fold at 4 °C and 7-fold at 30 °C relative to that of GST-DDR2 CKD (Fig. 2A). These data suggest that phosphorylation by Src reduces a thermodynam"

Although Slp4-a has been suggested to control insulin secretion through interaction with syntaxin-1a and/or Munc18-1, nothing is known about the binding partner(s) of Slp4-a during amylase release from parotid acinar cells, which do not endogenously express either syntaxin-1a or Munc18-1. In this study we systematically investigated the interaction between syntaxin-1-5 and Munc18-1-3 by co-immunoprecipitation assay using COS-7 cells and discovered that Slp4-a interacts with a closed conformation of syntaxin-2/3 in a Munc18-2-dependent manner, whereas Munc18-2 itself hardly interacts with Slp4-a at all. By contrast, Slp4-a was found to strongly interact with Munc18-1 regardless of the presence of syntaxin-2/3, and syntaxin-2/3 co-immunoprecipitated with Slp4-a only in the presence of Munc18-1/2. Deletion analysis showed that the syntaxin-2/3 (or Munc18-1/2)-binding site is a linker domain of Slp4-a (amino acid residues 144-354), a previously uncharacterized region located between the N-terminal Rab27A binding domain and the C2A domain. We also found that the Slp4-a·syntaxin-2 complex is actually present in rat parotid glands and that introduction of the antibody against Slp4-a linker domain into streptolysin O-permeabilized parotid acinar cells severely attenuates isoproterenol-stimulated amylase release, possibly by disrupting the interaction between Slp4-a and syntaxin-2/3 (or Munc18-2).

We have recently found that Slp4-a and Slac2-c are localized on amylase-containing granules in rat parotid acinar cells and that the latter protein is involved in amylase release from acinar cells through interaction with Rab27B, a closely related isoform of Rab27A, and actin filaments (32Imai A.

Because other syntaxin isoforms (e.g. syntaxin-2-4) and other Munc18 isoforms (e.g. Munc18-2-3) are expressed in the rat parotid gland and have been suggested to control amylase release (34Imai A. Nashida T. Shimomura H. Arch. Oral Biol. 2001; 46: 955-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 35Imai A. Nashida T. Shimomura H. Arch. Biochem.

Oral Biol. 2000; 45: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), Slp4-a may regulate amylase release through interaction with these syntaxins and/or Munc18s. However, these possibilities have never even been investigated in vitro. In this study we systematically investigated the interaction between syntaxin-1-5 and Munc18-1-3 in vitro and found that Slp4-a interacts with syntaxin-2/3 (specifically the closed conformation of syntaxin-2/3) only in the presence of Munc18-2 and not with syntaxin-2/3 alone or Munc18-2 alone. By contrast, Slp4-a interacts with Munc18-1 regardless of the presence of syntaxin-1a (29Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15390-15396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or syntaxin-2/3. Systematic deletion analysis further showed that syntaxin-2/3 (or Munc18-1/2) binds the linker domain of Slp4-a (amino acid residues 144-354) located between the SHD and the C2A domain. We also found that Slp4-a·syntaxin-2 complex is actually present in rat parotid glands and that introduction of the recombinant linker domain of Slp4-a or the antibody against the Slp4-a linker domain (i.e. anti-Slp4-a-linker antibody) into streptolysin O (SLO)-permeabilized parotid acinar cells severely attenuates isoproterenol (IPR)-stimulated amylase release. Based on these results, we propose that Slp4-a is a novel regulator of the closed conformation of syntaxin-2/3 in amylase release from parotid acinar cells.

After washing the beads 5 times with 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors, the proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by 10% (or 7.5%) SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-syntaxin-2 (1/500 dilution), anti-syntaxin-3 (1/250 dilution), anti-Munc18 (1/250 dilution), anti-Rab27B (6 μg/ml), and anti-Slp4-a-SHD rabbit polyclonal antibodies (2.6 μg/ml).

GST Pull-down Assay—T7-GST-Slp4-a-linker was expressed in COS-7 cells as described above, and the expressed GST fusion proteins were affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (wet volume 20 μl) as described previously (44Fukuda M. Kanno E. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 403: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The GST-Slp4-a-linker beads or beads coupled with GST alone as a control were incubated with ∼100 μl of total lysates of rat parotid glands (10 mg/ml; see above). After washing the beads 3 times with 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors, proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-syntaxin-2, anti-syntaxin-3, anti-Munc18, anti-Rab27B rabbit polyclonal antibody, and HRP-conjugated anti-GST antibody (1/10,000 dilution) as described above. Inhibition of the Slp4-a·Syntaxin-2 Interaction by Anti-Slp4-a Linker IgG in Vitro—GST-Slp4-a-linker was expressed in bacteria and affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads as described previously (44Fukuda M.

CENP-A is the centromere-specific histone H3 variant, and CENP-B specifically binds a 17-base pair sequence (the CENP-B box), which appears within every other α-satellite DNA repeat. In the present study, we demonstrated centromere-specific nucleosome formation in vitro with recombinant proteins, including histones H2A, H2B, H4, CENP-A, and the DNA-binding domain of CENP-B. The CENP-A nucleosome wraps 147 base pairs of the α-satellite sequence within its nucleosome core particle, like the canonical H3 nucleosome. Surprisingly, CENP-B binds to nucleosomal DNA when the CENP-B box is wrapped within the nucleosome core particle and induces translational positioning of the nucleosome without affecting its rotational setting. This CENP-B-induced translational positioning only occurs when the CENP-B box sequence is settled in the proper rotational setting with respect to the histone octamer surface. Therefore, CENP-B may be a determinant for translational positioning of the centromere-specific nucleosomes through its binding to the nucleosomal CENP-B box.

The centromere is a chromosomal locus that plays an essential role in chromosome segregation at mitosis and meiosis. These specific loci are located in the primary constriction of each chromosome and are organized into a specialized chromatin structure composed of α-satellite DNA repeats and their associated proteins (reviewed in Refs. 1Pluta A.F.

Interspersed CENP-A-containing nucleosomes (CENP-A nucleosomes) and histone H3-containing nucleosomes (H3 nucleosomes) in the centromere have been observed in stretched chromatin fibers (22Blower M.D. Sullivan B.A. Karpen G.H.

Consistent with this idea, the depletion of CENP-A causes significant dispersions of CENP-B and CENP-C, which are fundamental components of the centromere, in mouse cells (28Howman E.V. Fowler K.J.

We previously determined the crystal structures of the CENP-B N-terminal DNA-binding domain (amino acid residues 1-129) complexed with the CENP-B box DNA and the C-terminal dimerization domain (amino acid residues 540-599). The C-terminal dimerization domain consists of two α-helices, which are folded into an antiparallel configuration, and forms a dimer with a symmetrical, antiparallel, four-helix bundle structure (36Tawaramoto M.S. Park S.Y. Tanaka Y. Nureki O. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51454-51461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the N-terminal DNA-binding domain forms two helix-turn-helix motifs, which are bound to adjacent major grooves of the CENP-B box DNA (37Tanaka Y. Nureki O. Kurumizaka H. Fukai S. Kawaguchi S. Ikuta M. Iwahara J. Okazaki T. Yokoyama S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6612-6618Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The existence of the CENP-B box sequence within the α-satellite sequence is required for the formation of a functional centromere in vivo (38Ikeno M. Grimes B. Okazaki T. Nakano M. Saitoh K.

A nucleosome reconstitution experiment with canonical histones and CENP-B suggested that CENP-B has the potential to modulate nucleosome formation in the vicinity of the CENP-B box (45Yoda K. Ando S. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Okazaki T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 533-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, CENP-B may function as a trans-acting factor that regulates the formation of centromere-specific chromatin on the α-satellite DNA repeat at the nucleosome assembly level. In the present study, we reconstituted the centromere-specific nucleosome containing histones H2A, H2B, H4, and CENP-A and studied the role of CENP-B binding in nucleosome formation on α-satellite DNA in vitro. Recombinant Proteins—The recombinant human histones H2A, H2B, H3, H4, and CENP-A were purified as described previously (20Tanaka Y. Tawaramoto M.S. Kawaguchi S. Ohta T. Yoda K. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. Methods. 2004; 33: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The DNA fragments encoding histones H2A, H2B, H3, and CENP-A were inserted into the pHCE vector (BioLeaders) (46Poo H. Song J.J. Hong S.P. Choi Y.H. Yun S.W. Kim J.H. Lee S.C. Lee S.G. Sung M.H. Biotechnol. Lett. 2002; 24: 1185-1189Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and that encoding histone H4 was inserted into the pET15b vector (Novagen). The codons of the histone H4 and CENP-A genes were optimized for expression in Escherichia coli cells (20Tanaka Y. Tawaramoto M.S. Kawaguchi S. Ohta T. Yoda K. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. Methods. 2004; 33: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These recombinant proteins were expressed as N-terminal hexahistidine (His6)-tagged proteins. The His6-tagged histones and CENP-A were recovered in the insoluble fraction. The pellets were dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 6 m urea. The recombinant histones and CENP-A were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni2+-NTA)-agarose (Qiagen) chromatography under denaturing conditions. The H2A/H2B dimer, the H3/H4 tetramer, and the CENP-A/H4 tetramer were reconstituted by dialysis against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 2 m NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% glycerol. After the NaCl concentration was reduced, the His6 tags of these recombinant histones and CENP-A were removed by a treatment with thrombin protease. The recombinant human CENP-B-(1-129) was expressed in E. coli cells and was purified in the presence of 6 m urea, as described previously (37Tanaka Y. Nureki O. Kurumizaka H. Fukai S. Kawaguchi S.

The α-Satellite DNA Fragments—The human α-satellite DNA fragment (satellite-4) (20Tanaka Y. Tawaramoto M.S. Kawaguchi S. Ohta T. Yoda K. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. Methods. 2004; 33: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) was amplified from HeLa genomic DNA by the PCR, and was ligated into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega). The 186-base pair fragment was prepared by HindIII digestion of the plasmid containing the satellite-4 sequence, and its sequence is as follows: 5′-CTTGCTAGCAATCTGCAAGTGGATATTTGGACCGCATTGAGGCCTTCGTTGGAAACGGGATTTCTTCATTTCATGCTAGACAGAAGAATTCTCAGTAACTTCTTTGTGCTGTGTGTATTCAACTCACAGAGTGGAACGTCCCTTTGCACAGAGCAGATTTGAAACACTCTTTTTGTAGTCGACAAG-3′. The CENP-B box sequence is underlined. The 192-base pair fragment was amplified by PCR with the following primers (Fw, 5′-AGC TTG CTA GCA ATC TGC AAG T-3′; Rv, 5′-AAG CTT GTC GAC TAC AAA AAG AGT G-3′). This 192-base pair fragment contains three extra bases at both ends of the 186-base pair fragment. These α-satellite DNA fragments were purified by the electroelution method from an agarose gel. The 12 mutant α-satellite DNA fragments were constructed by the PCR mutagenesis method, and were ligated into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega). The Nucleosome Reconstitution Assay—The nucleosome-reconstitution assay was performed as described previously (20Tanaka Y. Tawaramoto M.S. Kawaguchi S. Ohta T. Yoda K. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. Methods. 2004; 33: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The H2A/H2B dimer (6 μg) and the H3/H4 tetramer or the CENP-A/H4 tetramer (6 μg) were mixed with the α-satellite DNA fragment (10 μg) at 4 °C in the presence of 6 m urea, 2 m NaCl, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The mixtures were first dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 m NaCl, and 5 m urea, for 4 h at room temperature and then for 4 h at 4 °C. Then the NaCl concentration was reduced from 2 to 0.6 m by adding 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 m NaCl, and 5 m urea, with a peristaltic pump (0.8 ml/min flow rate). After this gradient dialysis step, the urea was removed by dialysis against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.6 m NaCl. The sample was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 1 mm EDTA (or 0.1 mm EDTA), 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 m NaCl for 16 h at 4 °C. When the nucleosomes were reconstituted in the presence of CENP-B-(1-129), CENP-B-(1-129) (3.5 μg) was mixed with the H2A/H2B dimer (6 μg) and the H3/H4 tetramer or the CENP-A/H4 tetramer (6 μg), along with the α-satellite DNA fragment (10 μg), at 4 °C in the presence of 6 m urea, 2 m NaCl, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The mixtures were first dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 m NaCl, and 5 m urea, for 4 h at room temperature and then for 4 h at 4 °C. Then the NaCl concentration was reduced from 2 to 0.6 m by adding 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 m NaCl, and 5 m urea, with a peristaltic pump (0.8 ml/min flow rate). After this gradient dialysis step, the urea and NaCl concentrations were reduced by dialysis against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 m NaCl. The sample was dialyzed again against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 1 mm EDTA (or 0.1 mm EDTA), 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 m NaCl, for 16 h at 4 °C. The nucleosomes reconstituted with the recombinant histones and CENP-A were analyzed by nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mm Tris base, 45 mm boric acid, and 1.25 mm EDTA). The gel (20 × 20 × 0.1 cm) was run at 10 V/cm for 90 min. Bands were visualized by autoradiography and were quantitated with a BAS2500 image analyzer (Fuji). DNase I Footprinting—The α-satellite DNA was labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP at the NheI end (Fig. 1B). The reconstituted nucleosomes containing the 32P-labeled α-satellite DNA were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 m NaCl, for 16 h at 4 °C. After the dialysis, the Mg2+ concentration was adjusted to 3 mm, concomitantly with the addition of DNase I. Naked DNA and the CENP-B-(1-129)-DNA complex were treated with 0.2 units of DNase I (Takara, Japan)/μg of DNA. Nucleosomes were treated with 0.5 units of DNase I/μg of DNA. DNase I reactions were carried out at room temperature for 2 min and were terminated by the addition of EDTA to 25 mm. For the footprinting by the gel-purified method, the nucleosomes and the CENP-B-(1-129)-nucleosome complexes were separated by nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mm Tris base, 45 mm boric acid, and 1.25 mm EDTA), and the DNA fragments were isolated from the gel (47Lee D.Y. Hayes J.J. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 73-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). DNA fragments from these complexes were isolated and analyzed by denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase) Protection and Translational Positioning Assays—Reconstituted nucleosomes, containing 10 μg of DNA, were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 m NaCl, for 16 h at 4 °C. After the dialysis, the Ca2+ concentration was adjusted to 1 mm, concomitantly with the addition of MNase. Naked DNA was digested with 2.5 and 1.25 units/ml MNase (Worthington) for 5 min at 22 °C. The nucleosomes were digested with 1.5, 0.75, and 0.25 units/ml MNase, and the reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA to 25 mm. Then the DNA fragments were extracted with phenol/chloroform and were precipitated by ethanol. The purified DNA fragments were resuspended in 100 μl of TE buffer, and a 10-μl aliquot was used for the labeling reaction by T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Then the 32P-labeled DNA fragments were analyzed by nondenaturing 8% polyacrylamide gel (20 × 20 cm) electrophoresis. In the translational positioning assay, a 90-μl aliquot of the MNase-treated DNA fragments was subjected to nondenaturing 8% polyacrylamide gel (20 × 40 cm) electrophoresis, and the 147-base pair DNA fragments were extracted from the gel. The extracted 147-base pair fragments were labeled at both ends and were cleaved with EcoRI and DraIII. The resulting 32P-labeled DNA fragments were analyzed by denaturing 8% gel electrophoresis. The Ni2+-NTA Bead Pull-down Assay—Nucleosomes were reconstituted in 150 μl of a mixture, containing His6-tagged histones (H2A, H2B, H4, and CENP-A) (5 μg each), the wild-type or mutant α-satellite DNAs (192 bp, 10 μg), and CENP-B-(1-129) (7 μg), by the salt dialysis method described above. Then the reconstituted nucleosomes (150 μl) containing His6-tagged histones were precipitated with 4 μl of Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen), and the beads were washed twice with 500 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 1 mm2+ EDTA, and 0.2% Tween 20. The proteins precipitated with the Ni-NTA beads were analyzed by SDS-16% PAGE. The bands were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. CENP-A Is Properly Incorporated into the Nucleosome Core Particle with the Human α-Satellite Sequence—The nucleosome core particle is composed of a histone octamer (containing two H2A/H2B dimers and an H3/H4 tetramer) and a 147-base pair DNA fragment, which is tightly wrapped around the histone octamer (48Davey C.A. Sargent D.F. Luger K. Maeder A.W. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1097-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar, 49Richmond T.J. Davey C.A. Nature. 2003; 423: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). This 147-base pair fragment is protected from MNase digestion, and therefore, it can be detected after MNase digestion if the α-satellite DNA is properly wrapped around the histone octamer (MNase assay). To test whether CENP-A properly forms nucleosomes, we reconstituted the CENP-A nucleosome with recombinant histones H2A, H2B, H4, and CENP-A in the presence of a 186-base pair human α-satellite DNA fragment (Fig. 1, A-C). As shown in Fig. 1D, when the CENP-A nucleosomes, formed with the 186-base pair human α-satellite DNA fragment, were digested with MNase, a 147-base pair DNA fragment was detected by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (lanes 10 and 11). As controls, a 147-base pair DNA fragment was also detected when H3 nucleosomes were digested with MNase (Fig. 1D, lanes 5 and 6), but it was not obvious when the naked DNA fragment was used as a template for this assay (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 3). Therefore, these results indicate that the CENP-A nucleosome wraps 147 base pairs of the α-satellite sequence within its nucleosome core particle, like the canonical H3 nucleosome. CENP-B Can Bind to Nucleosomal DNA—Next, we performed the nucleosome reconstitution assay in the presence of the DNA-binding domain of human CENP-B (CENP-B-(1-129)) (32Kitagawa K. Masumoto H. Ikeda M. Okazaki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1602-1612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Tanaka Y. Nureki O. Kurumizaka H. Fukai S. Kawaguchi S. Ikuta M. Iwahara J. Okazaki T. Yokoyama S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6612-6618Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 50Tanaka Y. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). CENP-B specifically binds the CENP-B box (a 17-base pair DNA sequence) with this DNA-binding domain. The 186-base pair α-satellite DNA fragment used in this experiment contains a CENP-B box, and it is located in the region from base pair 44 to 60 (Fig. 1B). Since the nucleosome core particle contained 147 base pairs of DNA (Fig. 1D), the CENP-B box sequence could be located within the nucleosome core particle, even if the nucleosome was formed on an edge of this α-satellite DNA fragment (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 2A, CENP-B-(1-129) bound to the H3 and CENP-A nucleosomes. The nucleosome-CENP-B-(1-129) complexes migrated more slowly than the nucleosomes without CENP-B-(1-129) on a non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2A). A footprint of CENP-B-(1-129) binding to the CENP-B box sequence was detected in both the H3 and CENP-A nucleosomes by DNase I probing (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 7, respectively). However, the CENP-B footprint of the nucleosomal DNA was very weak as compared with that of the naked DNA (Fig. 2B, lanes 3, 5, and 7). To ensure that the histones and CENP-B-(1-129) did not dissociate during the DNase I treatment and to confirm that the foot-print did not result from two distinct complexes with or without CENP-B-(1-129), we gel-purified the CENP-B-(1-129)-nucleosome complexes and the nucleosomes after DNase I treatment, but the intensity of the CENP-B footprint did not change (Fig. 2C). Therefore, CENP-B-(1-129) specifically binds to the CENP-B box sequence within the nucleosomal DNA, although the footprint of the nucleosomal CENP-B box was not clear, as compared with that of the naked CENP-B box DNA. The CENP-B binding to the nucleosomal DNA may make the CENP-B box susceptible to DNase I, or the binding may not be stable, as compared with that with the naked CENP-B box DNA. CENP-B Binding Does Not Alter the Rotational Setting of the Nucleosomal DNA—When the nucleosomal DNA is rotationally phased on the histone octamer surface, a 10-base pair periodicity of DNase I-hypersensitive sites is observed (51Hayes J.J. Clark D.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6829-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In both H3 and CENP-A nucleosomes without CENP-B-(1-129), the 10-base pair periodicity was observed by DNase I probing (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 6, respectively), indicating that the α-satellite DNA was rotationally phased in both H3 and CENP-A nucleosomes. When the nucleosome-CENP-B-(1-129) complexes were probed by DNase I, the 10-base pair periodicity of the DNase I-hypersensitive sites was not different in the H3 and CENP-A nucleosomes, except around the CENP-B box (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 7, respectively). These results indicate that the rotational setting of the α-satellite nucleosomal DNA is not affected by the CENP-B binding. CENP-B-(1-129) Binding Induces Translational Positioning of Nucleosomes—Next, we tested whether CENP-B binding affects the translational position of the histone octamer along the α-satellite DNA. The H3 and CENP-A nucleosomes were reconstituted with or without CENP-B-(1-129) on the 186-base pair α-satellite DNA fragment, and the nucleosomal DNAs were treated with MNase. As shown in Fig. 3A, a 147-base pair protected DNA fragment was still observed when CENP-B-(1-129) bound to the nucleosomal DNA. To map the translational positioning of these nucleosomes, the resulting 147-base pair DNA fragments were excised from nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Then the extracted 147-base pair fragments were cleaved by a restriction enzyme, such as EcoRI, and were analyzed by 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, in the absence of CENP-B-(1-129), two major translational positions (positions A and B) were identified in both the H3 and CENP-A nucleosomes on the 186-base pair α-satellite DNA; position A is located on the distal edge of the DNA with respect to the CENP-B box, and position B is 11 base pairs away from position A. The bands corresponding to the DNA fragments protected from the MNase digestion were doublets, probably due to slippage of the nucleosome position (Fig. 3B). The ratios of the A:B positions were about 1:1 in both the H3 and CENP-A nucleosomes in the absence of CENP-B-(1-129) (Fig. 3B, lane 2 for H3 nucleosomes and lane 4 for CENP-A nucleosomes), suggesting that the histone octamer may be mobile between positions A and B. However, in the presence of CENP-B-(1-129), the amount of the position B nucleosomes drastically decreased, but the bands corresponding to the position A nucleosomes were still clearly observed (Fig. 3B, lane 3 for H3 nucleosomes, and lane 5 for CENP-A nucleosomes). Accordingly, CENP-B binding to the nucleosomal CENP-B box sequence induces the preferential formation of the position A nucleosome, suggesting that the translational positioning of nucleosomes is induced by CENP-B binding on α-satellite DNA. CENP-B binding to the nucleosomal CENP-B box may restrict the mobility of the histone octamer along the DNA fragment, like linker histones (52Ura K. Nightingale K. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4959-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Design of the Mutant α-Satellite DNA—To test whether the location of the CENP-B box sequence in the α-satellite DNA affects CENP-B binding to nucleosomal DNA, we constructed 12 mutant α-satellite DNAs (Fig. 4A). These mutant α-satellite DNAs were named -CB, -20, -10, -9, -6, -3, +3, +6, +9, +10, +20, and dyad. In the -CB α-satellite DNA, the 17-base pair CENP-B box was replaced by the sequence (5′-TAT CGT CTG CAG CGC CA-3′), which is inactive for CENP-B binding. In the -20, -10, -9, -6, and -3α-satellite DNAs, the CENP-B box was moved 20, 10, 9, 6, and 3 base pairs, respectively, toward the proximal edge of the α-satellite DNA fragment. On the other hand, in the +3, +6, +9, +10, and +20 α-satellite DNAs, the CENP-B box was moved 3, 6, 9, 10, and 20 base pairs, respectively, toward the distal edge of the α-satellite DNA fragment. In the dyad α-satellite DNA, the CENP-B box was moved to a location close to the dyad axis of the nucleosome. These mutant α-satellite DNA fragments (192 base pairs) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 4B, CENP-B-(1-129) bound to all of these mutant α-satellite DNAs, except for the -CB α-satellite DNA. The CENP-B-(1-129)-DNA complexes showed different mobilities on a nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 4B), probably due to the intrinsic curvature of the α-satellite sequence and the local DNA kinks (about 60°) induced by the CENP-B binding (37Tanaka Y. Nureki O. Kurumizaka H. Fukai S. Kawaguchi S. Ikuta M. Iwahara J. Okazaki T. Yokoyama S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6612-6618Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 53Crothers D.M. Gartenberg M.R. Shrader T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 118-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). CENP-B Binds to CENP-A Nucleosomes Containing Mutant α-Satellite DNAs—We tested CENP-B binding to the centromere-specific nucleosome, the CENP-A nucleosome, containing these mutant α-satellite DNAs. To do so, the CENP-A nucleosomes were reconstituted with the mutant α-satellite DNAs (192 base pairs, Fig. 4A) in the presence or absence of CENP-B-(1-129), and the resulting nucleosomes were analyzed by gel mobility shift assays. Surprisingly, CENP-B-(1-129) bound to all of the mutant α-satellite nucleosomes containing the CENP-B box sequence, as judged by the retarded mobilities of the CENP-B-(1-129)-nucleosome complexes (Fig. 5A). CENP-B-(1-129) bound neither naked nor nucleosomal -CB α-satellite DNA (Figs. 4B and 5A, lanes 1 and 3, respectively), indicating that CENP-B-(1-129) binding to these mutant α-satellite nucleosomal DNAs depends on the presence of the CENP-B box sequence. In order to confirm the CENP-B-(1-129) binding to the mutant α-satellite nucleosomes, we performed a Ni2+-NTA pull-down assay (Fig. 6A). In this assay, the mutant α-satellite nucleosomes containing His6-tagged histones and CENP-A were reconstituted in the presence of CENP-B-(1-129). CENP-B-(1-129) bound to the nucleosomal CENP-B box DNA was co-precipitated with His6-tagged histones and CENP-A by the Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) and was detected on an SDS-16% polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue as a band just above the histone H4 band. CENP-B-(1-129) was successfully co-precipitated with the histones in the presence of the wild-type α-satellite DNA (Fig. 6C, lane 2), but was not co-precipitated in the presence of the -CB α-satellite DNA (Fig. 6B, lane 2). These results indicate that CENP-B-(1-129) bound to the CENP-B box DNA but not to histones and nonspecific DNA. No proteins were detected in control experiments without His6-tagged histones (Fig. 6, B and C), indicating that the CENP-B-(1-129) bound to the nucleosome-free CENP-B box DNA was not precipitated. Consistent with the gel shift analysis, the CENP-B-(1-129) binding was detected with the -20, -10, -9, -6, -3, +3, +9, and +10 nucleosomes (Fig. 6, B (lanes 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12) and C (lanes 4, 8, and 10)). However, the CENP-B-(1-129) binding could not be detected with the +6, +20, and dyad nucleosomes (Fig. 6C, lanes 6, 12, and 14), although their interactions with CENP-B-(1-129) were detected in the gel shift analysis (Fig. 5A, lanes 19, 25, and 27). We repeated this entire experiment twice and confirmed that the results were consistent. Therefore, CENP-B may bind to the nucleosomes containing the +6, +20, and dyad mutant α-satellite, but its affinity for them could be very low. The Rotational Setting of the CENP-B Box Sequence Is Important for the Translational Positioning Induced by CENP-B—Next, we tested whether CENP-B induces the translational positioning of these CENP-A nucleosomes containing the mutant α-satellite DNA, like the case of the wild-type α-satellite DNA. As shown in Fig. 5B, multiple translational positions of the CENP-A nucleosomes containing the mutant α-satellite DNAs were observed without CENP-B-(1-129) (lanes 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, 27, and 29), although two major translational positions were observed with the wild-type α-satellite DNA (Fig. 3B). Surprisingly, upon CENP-B-(1-129) binding, single translational positioning (position A) of the CENP-A nucleosome was induced in the -20, -10, +9, and +10 nucleosomes (Fig. 5B, lanes 6, 8, 23, and 25, respectively). Therefore, the mobility of the histone octamer may be restricted in the -20, -10, +9, and +10 nucleosomes. In contrast, like the -CB nucleosome, the induction of translational positioning by CENP-B-(1-129) binding was not observed in the -9, -6, -3, +3, +6, +20, and dyad nucleosomes (Fig. 5B), although these nucleosomes have the ability to bind CENP-B-(1-129) (Fig. 5A). The -20 nucleosome may contain the CENP-B box in a linker region, not in the nucleosome core particle, if the nucleosome was located at the distal edge of the DNA (position A). However, part of the CENP-B box of the -10 nucleosome could be located within the nucleosome core particle, if the nucleosome formed at position A. Furthermore, the entire CENP-B box could be located within the nucleosome core particle in the +9 and +10 nucleosomes (Fig. 4A). Since the average pitch of nucleosomal DNA is about 10 base pairs/turn (48Davey C.A. Sargent D.F. Luger K. Maeder A.W. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1097-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar, 54Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar), the CENP-B box sequences in the -20, -10, +9, and +10 nucleosomes may have similar rotational settings to that of the wild-type α-satellite DNA with respect to the histone octamer surface. Therefore, the restriction of the nucleosome mobility by CENP-B may occur only when the CENP-B box is located with the proper rotational setting, with respect to the surface of the histone octamer within the nucleosome. CENP-B may be a determinant for the translational positioning of centromere-specific nucleosomes by its functional binding to the nucleosomal CENP-B box sequence. In the present study, we showed that CENP-B has the ability to bind to the CENP-B box sequence located within the nucleosome core particle. This suggests that CENP-B binds to nucleosomal DNA without seriously disrupting the contacts between the histone octamer and DNA. Actually, CENP-B binding did not disrupt the nucleosome. We tested two types of nucleosomes: a centromere-specific CENP-A nucleosome containing histones H2A, H2B, H4, and CENP-A and a canonical H3 nucleosome containing histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Genetic analyses with CENP-A-depleted mouse cells revealed that the absence of CENP-A caused significant dispersion of CENP-B (28Howman E.V. Fowler K.J. Newson A.J. Redward S. MacDonald A.C. Kalitsis P. Choo K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1148-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), suggesting that CENP-B binding to the centromere may depend on the presence of CENP-A. However, our in vitro analyses did not show any preference for CENP-B binding to the CENP-A nucleosome rather than the H3 nucleosome. Additional factor(s) or an unrevealed mechanism may be involved in the functional links between CENP-A and CENP-B. According to the crystal structure of CENP-B-(1-129) complexed with CENP-B box DNA, CENP-B-(1-129) directly contacts three essential sites (sites 1-3) within the 17-base pair CENP-B box sequence (37Tanaka Y. Nureki O. Kurumizaka H. Fukai S. Kawaguchi S. Ikuta M. Iwahara J. Okazaki T. Yokoyama S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6612-6618Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). All of these direct interactions between CENP-B-(1-129) and DNA are formed on only one side of the DNA helix and induce local DNA kinks of about 60° (Fig. 7A). Therefore, we constructed a docking model between the nucleosome core particle and the CENP-B-(1-129) structures (Fig. 7B). In this model, we supposed that the nucleosome is formed at position A, because CENP-B binding induced preferential nucleosome formation at position A. As shown in Fig. 7B, CENP-B-(1-129) could bind to the nucleosomal DNA without serious steric hindrance in this model. This model structure does not contain the DNA kinks induced by CENP-B binding. No significant difference in MNase susceptibility was observed between the nucleosome and the nucleosome-CENP-B-(1-129) complex, indicating that the nucleosome core particle somehow accommodates the CENP-B-induced DNA kinks and maintains nucleosome stability upon CENP-B binding. Further structural studies of the nucleosome-CENP-B complex are required to understand the functional accommodation of CENP-B within the nucleosome core particle. The CENP-B box sequence reportedly functions as a cis-element for nucleosome assembly on α-satellite DNA (45Yoda K. Ando S. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Okazaki T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 533-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, in the present study, we directly showed that CENP-B binding to the nucleosomal CENP-B box induced translational positioning of the nucleosome core particles. Nucleosome reconstitution experiments with the mutant α-satellite DNAs showed that inappropriate localization of the CENP-B box within the nucleosomal α-satellite DNA still allowed CENP-B binding to the nucleosomal CENP-B box sequence but did not induce translational positioning of the nucleosome core particle. These facts indicate that the proper rotational setting of the CENP-B box within the nucleosome is essential for the CENP-B-induced translational positioning, which may function in the centromere-specific chromatin formation. The DNase I footprinting experiment showed that the α-satellite DNA sequence was rotationally phased in both the H3 and CENP-A nucleosomes, probably due to its intrinsic curvature (55Martinez-Balbas A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4811-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This intrinsic rotational setting ability of the α-satellite sequence is important to determine the CENP-B box rotational setting, which regulates the CENP-B-induced translational positioning of the nucleosome. Therefore, the rotational setting and translational positioning of the centromere-specific nucleosomes are tightly linked in the presence of CENP-B and may be important for the formation of a functional centromere-specific chromatin structure. It has been reported that demethylation of centromeric satellite DNA sequences, accomplished by growing cells in the presence of a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, resulted in the redistribution of CENP-B (58Mitchell A.R. Jeppesen P. Nicol L. Morrison H. Kipling D. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the CENP-B box sequence contains two CpG dinucleotides within its essential sites for CENP-B binding (37Tanaka Y. Nureki O. Kurumizaka H. Fukai S. Kawaguchi S. Ikuta M. Iwahara J. Okazaki T. Yokoyama S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6612-6618Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We previously found that CENP-B preferentially binds to an unmethylated CENP-B box, and the DNA-binding ability of CENP-B is reduced nearly to the level of nonspecific binding by CpG methylation at both sites (50Tanaka Y. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed that CENP-B binding to the nucleosomal CENP-B box induces the translational positioning of nucleosomes on the α-satellite sequence. Therefore, CpG methylation at the CENP-B box may be an important regulator of centromere-specific chromatin formation, through the CENP-B-induced nucleosome positioning on the α-satellite DNA repeats.

https://openalex.org/W2139270713,"The assembly of bacterial membrane proteins with large periplasmic loops is an intrinsically complex process because the SecY translocon has to coordinate the signal recognition particle-dependent targeting and integration of transmembrane domains with the SecA-dependent translocation of the periplasmic loop. The current model suggests that the ATP hydrolysis by SecA is required only if periplasmic loops larger than 30 amino acids have to be translocated. In agreement with this model, our data demonstrate that the signal recognition particle- and SecA-dependent multiple spanning membrane protein YidC becomes SecA-independent if the large periplasmic loop connecting transmembrane domains 1 and 2 is reduced to less than 30 amino acids. Strikingly, however, we were unable to render single spanning membrane proteins SecA-independent by reducing the length of their periplasmic loops. For these proteins, the complete assembly was always SecA-dependent even if the periplasmic loop was reduced to 13 amino acids. If, however, the 13-amino acid-long periplasmic loop was fused to a downstream transmembrane domain, SecA was no longer required for complete translocation. Although these data support the current model on the SecA dependence of multiple spanning membrane proteins, they indicate a novel function of SecA for the assembly of single spanning membrane proteins.

The subsequent transfer of the RNC to the Sec translocon is probably favored by the proposed close vicinity of the SR to the Sec translocon (3Alder N. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22787-22790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A direct interaction between FtsY, the bacterial SR, and SecY has recently been demonstrated in Escherichia coli (4Angelini S. Deitermann S. Koch H.G. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 476-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast to the eukaryotic SRP, which targets both membrane and secretory proteins, the bacterial SRP is predominantly engaged in membrane protein targeting. The vast majority of bacterial secretory proteins, i.e. proteins that are destined to reach the periplasmic space or the outer membrane, are post-translationally targeted by the bacteria-specific SecA/SecB pathway (5Driessen A.J.M. Manting E. van der Does C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In this pathway, SecB functions as a secretion-specific chaperone for most secretory proteins, whereas SecA is proposed to translocate the preprotein in a stepwise translocation of stretches of about 30 amino acids (6Economou A.

Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22787-22790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This is different for bacterial membrane proteins with large periplasmic domains, which are cotranslationally targeted to the membrane by SRP/SR but are fully assembled only in the presence of SecA (9Neumann-Haefelin C. Schäfer U. Müller M. Koch H.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 10Scotti P. Valent Q. Manting E. Urbanus M. Driessen A. Oudega B. Luirink J. J. Biol.

For these proteins, the ATP hydrolysis by SecA is thought to provide the energy for the translocation of the large periplasmic loops (12Dalbey R.E. Chen M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 37-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Additionally the proton motive force appears to be required for complete translocation (13van der Laan M. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1659-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast, neither SecA nor the proton motive force is required for the complete assembly of bacterial membrane proteins without extended periplasmic domains. This has been shown for the multiple spanning membrane proteins mannitol permease and SecY (14Koch H.G. Hengelage T. Neumann-Haefelin C. MacFarlane J. Hoffschulte H.K. Schimz K.L. Mechler B.

In this study we analyzed the SRP- and SecA-dependent steps during the assembly of two SRP- and SecA-dependent membrane proteins: the single spanning type II model protein Momp2 (9Neumann-Haefelin C. Schäfer U. Müller M. Koch H.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and the multiple spanning membrane protein YidC (16Koch H.G. Moser M. Müller M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5715-5718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17Urbanus M.L. Froderberg L. Drew D. Bjork P. de Gier J.W. Brunner J. Oudega B. Luirink J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12718-12723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In agreement with the proposed model we demonstrate that the assembly of YidC requires SecA only if periplasmic loops larger than 30 amino acids have to be translocated. Unexpectedly, however, the single spanning Momp2 was, like single spanning YidC derivatives, always SecA-dependent irrespective of the length of the periplasmic loop. If, however, small periplasmic loops were fused to a downstream transmembrane (TM) domain, their translocation became SecA-independent. These data indicate that the SecA dependence of a bacterial membrane protein is not solely determined by the length of the periplasmic loop but also by the presence of a downstream TM domain. Strains—The following E. coli strains were used: BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen, Bad Soden, Germany), MRE600 (18Müller M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1996; 85: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Plasmids and Plasmid Construction—For in vitro protein synthesis, the following plasmids were used: pMomp2 (Momp2) (9Neumann-Haefelin C. Schäfer U. Müller M. Koch H.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), p717-MtlA (mannitol permease) (9Neumann-Haefelin C. Schäfer U. Müller M. Koch H.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and pDMB (pOmpA) (23Behrmann M. Koch H.G. Hengelage T. Wieseler B. Hoffschulte H.K. Müller M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13898-13904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For in vitro expression of YidC we used pKSM717-YidC, which was constructed by ligating the NcoI/EcoRI fragment of plasmid pROEX-HTB-yidC (24Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) into pKSM717 (25Maneewannakul S. Maneewannakul K. Ippen-Ihler K. Plasmid. 1994; 31: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). YidC deletion plasmids were constructed by PCR introducing a first BglII site at codon 336 of YidC. A second BglII site was then introduced at either codons 30, 51, 61, 71, or 173, respectively. Digestion with BglII and religation yielded the plasmids pKSM717-YidC-Δ307, pKSM717-YidC-Δ286, pKSM717-YidC-Δ276, pKSM717-YidC-Δ266, and pKSM717-YidC-Δ164, respectively. To obtain YidC deletion mutants containing only one or two TM domains, TGA stop codons were introduced at codon 39 or codon 81 of YidC in plasmid pKSM717-YidC-Δ307, resulting in the plasmids pKSM717-YidCΔ307TM1 and pKSM717-YidCΔ307TM1-2, respectively. Preparation of Membranes—Inverted inner membrane vesicles (INVs) from wild type E. coli (MRE600), TY1, EK414, and KN553 were prepared as described previously (18Müller M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7421-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). SecE-depleted membranes were prepared from E. coli strain CM124 carrying a chromosomal secE deletion and an arabinose-inducible secE copy on the plasmid pCM22. CM124 cells were grown at 37 °C in the presence of 0.4% arabinose up to midlog phase, harvested by centrifugation, and washed twice in INV medium (18Müller M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7421-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cells were diluted 1:500 in fresh INV medium containing either 0.4% arabinose (SecYE+) or 0.4% glucose (SecYE-). The bacterial cultures were grown at 37 °C up to an A600 of 1.5 and harvested. Urea treatment of INVs (generating U-INVs) was performed as described previously (14Koch H.G. Hengelage T. Neumann-Haefelin C. MacFarlane J. Hoffschulte H.K. Schimz K.L. Mechler B. Müller M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2163-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) using a final urea concentration of 4 m. In Vitro Synthesis—In vitro protein synthesis and the composition of the reconstituted transcription/translation system of E. coli, purification of its components, and protease protection assay used in this study have been described previously (14Koch H.G. Hengelage T. Neumann-Haefelin C. MacFarlane J. Hoffschulte H.K. Schimz K.L. Mechler B. Müller M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2163-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 9Neumann-Haefelin C. Schäfer U. Müller M. Koch H.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Synthesis of RNCs was achieved as described in Beck et al. (26Beck K. Wu L.F. Brunner J. Müller M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 134-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) by the addition of the following oligodeoxynucleotides: Momp2-60, 5′-GTTGATGAAACCAGTATCATG-3′ (4 μg/25 μl); Momp2-65, 5′-TCGGGCCATTGTTGTTGATG-3′, (4 μg/25 μl); Momp2-70, 5′-CCAGTTGGTTTTCATGGGTCG-3′ (2.5 μg/25 μl); Momp2-86, 5′-CAAAGCCAACATACGGGTTAAC-3′ (3 μg/25 μl); Momp2-146, 5′-TAAACGTTGGATTTAGTGTC-3′ (3 μg/25 μl); Momp2-301, 5′-GGAGATCAGGTAATCAACAAC-3′ (4 μg/25 μl); Momp2-329, 5′-CTGTTTCACGTTGTCACAGGTG-3′ (4 μg/25 μl); YidC-330, 5′-AGAGATGAACCACAACCAACC-3′ (3 μg/25 μl); YidC-422, 5′-GATCAGCAGCGGGAAGCAGCC-3′ (3 μg/25 μl); and YidC-447, 5′-CACAGTGCAAACGGTGCCTG-3′ (3 μg/25 μl). RNase H (1 unit/25 μl) and 10Sa RNA antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (5′-TTAAGCTGCTAAAGCGTAGTTTTCGTCGTTTGCGACTA-3′; 0.25 μg/25 μl) were added routinely. To release the RNCs from the ribosome, puromycin was added to the reaction mixture at a final concentration of 0.8 mm with a further incubation for 15 min at 37 °C. For carbonate extraction of membrane-bound RNCs, samples were treated with freshly prepared 0.2 m Na2CO3, pH 11.3 (27Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar) for 30 min on ice. Membranes were then recovered by centrifugation in a Beckman TLA-100.2 rotor at 70,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. For flotation gradient analyses, the reaction mixture was adjusted to 1.6 m sucrose (final volume, 100 μl) and overlaid with 200 μl of 1.25 m sucrose and 100 μl of 0.25 m sucrose, each prepared in 40 mm triethanolamine acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, and 70 mm potassium acetate. After centrifugation for 90 min at 100,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA-100.2 rotor, four fractions of 100 μl each were withdrawn from the top of the gradient and trichloroacetic acid-precipitated (5% final concentration). The pellet was directly dissolved in SDS loading buffer. For subsequent translocation assays of membrane-bound RNCs, fractions 2 and 3 of the gradient, representing the vesicle fractions, were withdrawn and incubated further for 20 min at 37 °C in the presence of 0.8 mm puromycin and an ATP-regenerating system (2.5 mm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 8 mm creatine phosphate, and 40 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase). SecA36 (20Matsumoto G. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6384-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was present at concentrations of 300 ng/25 μl during this incubation where indicated; wild type SecA was added at a concentration of 900 ng/25 μl. These concentrations, like those of Ffh (150 ng/25 μl) and FtsY (500 ng/25 μl), were shown to efficiently stimulate protein transport into U-INVs (14Koch H.G. Hengelage T. Neumann-Haefelin C.

The purifications of SecA, SecA36, Ffh, and FtsY have been described previously (14Koch H.G. Hengelage T. Neumann-Haefelin C. MacFarlane J. Hoffschulte H.K. Schimz K.L. Mechler B. Müller M. Mol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 22161-22167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Sample Analysis and Quantification—SDS-PAGE (15 and 17%) was carried out according to Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). For Momp2-60, Momp2-65, and Momp2-70, a Tris-Tricine (6-16.5%) SDS-PAGE system was performed as described previously (30Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). YidCΔ307 and its derivatives were separated by 22% urea-SDS-PAGE. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by phosphorimaging using an Amersham Biosciences Phosphor-Imager and quantified using ImageQuant software from Amersham Biosciences. Reagents—Growth media components and chemicals were obtained from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany), Sigma, and Promega (Mannheim, Germany). Oligodeoxynucleotides were from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). The [35S]Met/Cys labeling mixture was from Amersham Biosciences. SRP and SecA Are Involved in Distinct Steps during the Transport of Bacterial Membrane Proteins—For analyzing the SRP- and SecA-dependent steps of membrane protein assembly individually we used the secY205 mutant in which the SecA-SecY interaction is impaired (21Traxler B. Murphy C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12394-12400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). SecA-dependent proteins are not translocated into INVs derived form the secY205 mutant as shown in Fig. 1A for the SecA-dependent secretory protein OmpA. In the presence of wild type INVs, almost 50% of the in vitro synthesized material was translocated into the lumen of these vesicles as deduced from its proteinase K resistance. In the presence of secY205 INVs, however, translocation was reduced to 3%, which is consistent with the SecA-dependent translocation of OmpA. SecA36, a highly active SecA derivative, has been shown to specifically suppress the secY205 defect (21Traxler B. Murphy C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12394-12400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 28Beha D. Deitermann S. Müller M. Koch H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22161-22167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, the translocation of OmpA into secY205 INVs was completely restored by the addition of purified SecA36 (Fig. 1A) but not by the addition of wild type SecA. The SecA dependence of membrane proteins like Momp2 and YidC also can be disclosed by use of the secY205 mutant. In the presence of wild type INVs (Fig. 1A), a membrane-protected fragment of Momp2 (Momp2-MPF) was observed that corresponds to the TM domain and the 320-amino acid-long periplasmic domain translocated into the lumen of the INVs. The reduction in size is due to proteinase K cleavage of the major part of the N-terminal amphiphilic helix (9Neumann-Haefelin C. Schäfer U. Müller M. Koch H.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The occurrence of the Momp2-MPF was significantly reduced in the presence of secY205 INVs unless SecA36 was added. Similar results were also observed for YidC in which TM domains 1 and 2 are connected by a 320-amino acid-long periplasmic loop. The 42-kDa protease-protected fragment of YidC, observed in the presence of wild type INVs (Fig. 1A), was only barely detectable in the presence of secY205 INVs. This fragment corresponds to the first two TM domains and the connecting periplasmic loop (16Koch H.G. Moser M. Müller M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5715-5718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 31Serek J. Bauer-Manz G. Struhalla G. van den Berg L. Kiefer D. Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 294-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Only by adding SecA36 to secY205 INVs was a significant translocation of the periplasmic loop observed (Fig. 1A). In contrast to Momp2 and YidC, the SecA-independent membrane protein mannitol permease (MtlA) (14Koch H.G. Hengelage T. Neumann-Haefelin C. MacFarlane J. Hoffschulte H.K. Schimz K.L. Mechler B. Müller M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2163-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), which lacks extended periplasmic loops, was not affected by the secY205 mutation, and its integration was not stimulated by the addition of SecA36 (Fig. 1A). SecA-dependent membrane proteins are, like SecA-independent membrane proteins, cotranslationally targeted to the SecY translocon by SRP. We therefore analyzed whether the secY205 mutation would affect the membrane targeting of Momp2 and YidC. As shown previously (9Neumann-Haefelin C. Schäfer U. Müller M. Koch H.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the cotranslational binding of RNCs to the membrane can be analyzed by flotation gradient centrifugation. If Momp2-329, a nascent chain of 329 amino acids, was subjected to flotation gradient centrifugation in the absence of INVs (Fig. 1B), about 90% of the nascent chains were recovered from the bottom fractions (fractions 4 and 5) of the gradient. In contrast, in the presence of wild type INVs more than 80% of the material was found in the membrane-containing fractions 2 and 3 of the gradient. The same partitioning into the membrane fractions of the gradient was observed when Momp2-RNCs were synthesized in the presence of secY205. This reflects a SecA-independent targeting of Momp2-RNCs to the SecY205 translocon. To directly demonstrate that the binding of Momp2-RNCs to the secY205 INVs was due to cotranslational targeting mediated by SRP, the secY205 INVs were extracted with 4 m urea. This treatment has been shown to remove the membrane-bound SRP, SR, and SecA (14Koch H.G. Hengelage T. Neumann-Haefelin C. MacFarlane J. Hoffschulte H.K. Schimz K.L. Mechler B. Müller M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2163-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Membrane binding of Momp2-RNCs to urea-treated secY205 INVs was drastically reduced but could be completely restored if purified Ffh, the protein component of the bacterial SRP, and purified FtsY, the bacterial SR, were added (Fig. 1B). The addition of 4.5 S RNA, which together with Ffh forms the bacterial SRP, was not necessary in these experiments due to sufficient amounts of 4.5 S RNA in the in vitro system used (14Koch H.G. Hengelage T. Neumann-Haefelin C. MacFarlane J. Hoffschulte H.K. Schimz K.L. Mechler B. Müller M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2163-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The same SRP- and FtsY-dependent cotranslational targeting to secY205 INVs was observed for YidC-447-RNCs, a nascent chain of 447 amino acids (Fig. 1B). Thus, although the impaired SecA-SecY interaction in the secY205 INVs blocks the complete assembly of SecA-dependent membrane proteins, it does not reduce their SRP-dependent membrane targeting. To examine whether the SRP-dependent targeting of SecA-dependent membrane proteins to secY205 INVs resulted in lipid anchorage of the TM domain, we used alkaline extraction as a suitable method to differentiate between lipid-inserted proteins and peripherally bound E. coli proteins (10Scotti P. Valent Q. Manting E. Urbanus M. Driessen A. Oudega B. Luirink J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29883-29888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Momp2-329-RNCs were synthesized in the absence or presence of wild type and mutant INVs and were subsequently extracted with sodium carbonate followed by an ultracentrifugation step. The supernatant, containing the carbonate extracted material, and the pellet, containing the carbonate-resistant material, were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In the absence of INVs more than 70% of the radioactive material was recovered from the supernatant after centrifugation (Fig. 2). In the presence of wild type INVs, however, more than 80% of the Momp2-RNCs became carbonate-resistant suggesting lipid insertion of the single TM domain of Momp2, which must have occurred while the ribosome was still attached. Consistent with this notion, the addition of puromycin to release the ribosome did not further increase the amount of carbonate-resistant material. 4S. Deitermann, G. S. Sprie, and H.-G. Koch, unpublished data. The same carbonate resistance (<80%) was also observed when Momp2-RNCs were synthesized in the presence of secY205 INVs (Fig. 2). Thus, the inability of SecA to functionally interact with SecY in the secY205 INVs does not interfere with the lipid insertion of the TM domain of Momp2. Membrane integration of Momp2-RNCs leading to carbonate resistance did, however, require the Sec translocon. This was shown by analyzing carbonate extraction with INVs derived from the E. coli strain CM124. In this strain the expression of the essential secE gene is induced by arabinose (21Traxler B. Murphy C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12394-12400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Under SecE-depleting conditions, SecY is rapidly degraded by the membrane-bound protease FtsH (32Akiyama Y. Ito K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 711-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and only barely detectable by Western blotting with α-SecY antibodies (Fig. 2). Whereas in SecE containing CM124 INVs 81% of the Momp2-RNCs were carbonate-resistant (Fig. 2); only 25% of the Momp2-RNCs were carbonate-resistant in the presence of SecE-depleted CM124 INVs. The residual carbonate resistance of RNCs in SecE-depleted INVs is expected partly because complete depletion of the essential SecE is difficult to achieve and partly because of the formation of carbonate-resistant aggregates. Collectively our data demonstrate that the SRP-dependent cotranslational targeting of bacterial membrane proteins with extended periplasmic loops leads to a stable binding of the RNCs to the membrane. Importantly during this step the signal anchor sequence gains access to the lipid phase in the absence of a functional SecA-SecY interaction. The subsequent translocation of the periplasmic loop then requires a functional interaction between the Sec translocon and SecA. Ribosome Release Is Required for Complete Translocation of the Periplasmic Loop in Single but Not in Multiple Spanning Membrane Proteins—The release of the ribosome was not required for lipid insertion of the TM domain of Momp2 (Fig. 2). To address the question whether also the SecA-dependent translocation of the periplasmic loop would occur while the ribosome was still attached, we analyzed protease protection of Momp2-RNCs prior to or after ribosome release by puromycin. In the presence of wild type INVs about 50% of Momp2-329-RNCs were protease-protected after puromycin treatment, but only 17% were protease-protected in the absence of puromycin (Fig. 3B, upper panel, lanes 5 and 6). These remaining 17% most likely result from a puromycin-independent detachment of the ribosome during handling of the RNCs. Consistent with the SecA-dependent translocation of the periplasmic loop, significant protease protection of Momp2-329 in the presence of secY205 INVs was only observed if puromycin and SecA36 were added (Fig. 3B, upper panel, lanes 11 and 12). These results indicate that the release of the ribosome is a prerequisite for the SecA-dependent translocation of the periplasmic loop in Momp2 presumably because SecA does not have sufficient access to even long hydrophilic loops that are still bound to the ribosome. Surprisingly, however, if YidC-447-RNCs, consisting of three TM domains (Fig. 3A), were analyzed in the same experimental setup, protease protection of the 320-amino acid-long periplasmic loop was independent of the addition of puromycin (Fig. 3B, middle panel, lanes 5 and 6). To confirm that the translocation of YidC-447-RNCs in the presence of the ribosome was still SecA-dependent, protease protection in secY205 INVs was analyzed in the presence or absence of SecA36. The periplasmic loop of YidC-447 was translocated into secY205 INVs only when SecA36 was present, but the release of the ribosome was not required to obtain a stable translocation product (Fig. 3B, middle panel, lanes 11 and 12). We next tested the effect of puromycin on the translocation of YidC-330-RNCs, which like the Momp2-RNCs consist of a single TM domain, connected to a 307-amino acid-long periplasmic loop (Fig. 3A). As for Momp2-329-RNCs, efficient protease protection of YidC-330-RNCs was observed only after the ribosome had been released by the addition of puromycin (Fig. 3B, lower panel, lanes 5 and 6) and was clearly SecA-dependent (Fig. 3B, lower panel, lanes 9 and 12). In summary, for single spanning membrane proteins like Momp2-329 or YidC-330, complete SecA-dependent translocation is observed only after the release of the ribosome, i.e. after protein synthesis is terminated. In contrast, if the periplasmic domain is followed by a downstream TM domain, its SecA-dependent translocation occurs before protein synthesis is terminated, i.e. in the presence of the ribosome.

https://openalex.org/W2033687515,"Until recently, the only facilitated hexose transporter GLUT proteins (SLC2A) known to transport fructose were GLUTs 2 and 5. However, the recently cloned GLUT7 can also transport fructose as well as glucose. Comparison of sequence alignments indicated that GLUTs 2, 5, and 7 all had an isoleucine residue at position “314” (GLUT7), whereas the non-fructose-transporting isoforms, GLUTs 1, 3, and 4, had a valine at this position. Mutation of Ile-314 to a valine in GLUT7 resulted in a loss of fructose transport, whereas glucose transport remained completely unaffected. Similar results were obtained with GLUTs 2 and 5. Energy minimization modeling of GLUT7 indicated that Ile-314 projects from transmembrane domain 7 (TM7) into the lumen of the aqueous pore, where it could form a hydrophobic interaction with tryptophan 89 from TM2. A valine residue at 314 appeared to produce a narrowing of the vestibule when compared with the isoleucine. It is proposed that this hydrophobic interaction across the pore forms a selectivity filter restricting the access of some hexoses to the substrate binding site(s) within the aqueous channel. The presence of a selectivity filter in the extracellular vestibule of GLUT proteins would allow for subtle changes in substrate specificity without changing the kinetic parameters of the protein.

The facilitative glucose transporters (SLC2a) belong to the facilitated transporter super gene family, which all appear to have a core structure of 12 transmembrane helices clustered in two sets of six between which there is a central aqueous pore (1Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The recent crystal structures solved for LacY and GlpT suggest that during the transport cycle, these two clusters undergo an alteration in their tilt such that their binding site moves from an outward- to an inward-facing conformation (2Abramson J.

What is less clear is the shape of the outer- or inner-facing vestibules allowing entry of the substrates into the pore and access to the proposed substrate binding site. Mueckler et al. (7Mueckler M. Kruse M. Strube M. Riggs A.C. Chiu K.C. Permutt M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17765-17767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) initially reported that a naturally occurring conservative mutation of valine 197 to isoleucine (V197I) in GLUT2 resulted in a greatly reduced transport capacity when the protein was expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Subsequently, they also reported that a comparable mutation in GLUT1 (valine 165 to isoleucine) abolished glucose transport (8Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Valine is a smaller residue than isoleucine, and this raised the possibility that, if these residues in TM5 faced into the pore, the larger isoleucine might hinder the passage of substrate. These results did not explain why such a conservative substitution could have such a profound effect on the function of these proteins. However, it has been proposed that one or more hydrophobic residues projecting into the pore can influence substrate access to the binding site through steric hindrance (8Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). facilitated glucose transporter proteins transmembrane domain human. GLUTs 1, 3, and 4 can transport glucose and galactose but not fructose, whereas GLUT2 can transport all three, and GLUT5 can only recognize fructose and possibly 2-deoxyglucose. Sequence alignments using this limited number of isoforms revealed the QLS motif in TM7 as a likely substrate selectivity filter (9Seatter M.J. De la Rue S.A. Porter L.M. Gould G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, recently, the SLC2a family has been expanded to 14 possible members (10Joost H.G. Bell G.I. Best J.D. Birnbaum M.J. Charron M.J. Chen Y.T. Doege H. James D.E. Lodish H.F. Moley K.H. Moley J.F. Mueckler M. Rogers S. Schurmann A. Seino S. Thorens B. Am. J.

Genomics. 2002; 80: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), of which we have shown that GLUT7 is another glucose/fructose transporter (12Li Q. Manolescu A. Ritzel M. Yao S. Slugoski M. Young J.D. Chen X.Z. Cheeseman C.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: G236-G242Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Comparison of the sequence alignments of the full family showed another possible hydrophobic residue, which might be related to fructose specificity, namely Ile-314 found in TM7 of GLUT7. GLUTs 2 and 5, which recognize fructose, also express Ile at the equivalent position. In contrast, the non-fructose-transporting proteins, GLUTs 1, 3, and 4, have a valine at the equivalent position. This led us to hypothesize that this hydrophobic residue might play a role in the recognition of fructose. We have employed site-directed mutagenesis to investigate this possibility by changing this isoleucine residue to valine in GLUTs 7, 2, and 5. Our results indicated that Ile-314 is critical for the transport of fructose by GLUT7 but has no influence on the recognition of glucose. Computer modeling of the docking of glucose and fructose in GLUT7 indicated that Ile-314 projects into the lumen of the vestibule directly above the putative initial substrate binding site. Our results provided clear evidence that this residue in TM7 plays a key role in determining the ability of fructose to be transported by GLUT proteins. Site-directed Mutagenesis—A 4597-bp human wild type GLUT7-pGEM-HE construct was used as a template for creating a GLUT7 mutant in which we substituted isoleucine for valine 314 (I314V). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The forward and reverse primers were 5′-CGG GCA TCA ATG CGT TCA ACT ACT ATG CGG AC-3′ and 5′-GTC CGC ATA GTA GTT GAA CGC ATT GAT GCC CG-3′. A second mutant was created using the same strategy but replacing Val with Ser. These primers were: forward, 5′-TCG GGC ATC AAT GCC AGC AAC TAC TAT GCG GAC ACC-3′, and reverse, 5′GGT GTC CGC ATA GTA GTT GCT GGC ATT GAT GCC CGA-3′. To create the homolog mutant for GLUT2, we used the forward and reverse primers 5′-CCG GAA TCA ATG GCG TTT TTT ACT ACT CAA CCA GC-3′ and 5′-GCT GGT TGA GTA GTA AAA AAC GCC ATT GAT TCC GG-3′. For the corresponding GLUT5 mutant, we used the forward primer 5′-CGG GCG TCA ACG CTG TCT ACT ACT ACG C-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GCG TAG TAG TAG ACA GCG TTG ACG CCC G-3′. The resulting plasmids were transformed in Escherichia coli DH-α5 electro-competent cells, which were incubated for 16-18 h on agar plates enriched with ampicillin. cRNA Preparation and Xenopus laevis Oocyte Microinjection—Plasmids containing each of the wild type and mutant GLUT isoforms (hGLUT7/GLUT7 I314V, GLUT7/I314S, hGLUT2/GLUT2 I322V, hGLUT5/GLUT5 I296V) were linearized with NheI and transcribed in vitro with T7 polymerase mMESSAGE mMACHINE™ (Ambion). Adult female X. laevis oocytes (prepared as described previously (13Yao S. Cass C. Young J. Baldwin S.A. Membrane Transport: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, London2000: 47-77Google Scholar)) were injected with 10-50 nl (∼20 ng) of cRNA (wild type or mutant GLUT7) and incubated for 3-5 days at 16-18 °C prior to functional uptake assays. The concentration of RNA was determined using a Bio-Rad SmartSpec™ 3000 machine. Determination of the Functional Activity by Radiotracer Flux Assays—The influx experiments were performed at 20 °C using 10-12 oocytes for each condition and 14C- or 3H-labeled hexose at a specific activity of 4 μCi/ml. Oocytes were washed with ice-cold modified Barth's medium to stop the incubation, and then individual oocytes were placed in vials and dissolved in 0.5 ml of 5% SDS for 30 min. Finally, scintillation fluid (5 ml) was added to each vial, and radioactivity was measured using a Beckman LS6500 liquid scintillation counter. All experiments were performed 3-7 times, and the results were compared with the influx values obtained with water-injected oocytes. Kinetic Analysis—Hexose uptake into oocytes expressing GLUT7 or its mutants was measured over a range of concentrations from 0.05 to 6 mm using 30-min incubations, which had been determined to be within the linear slope of uptake. Uptake was corrected for nonspecific entry using water-injected eggs from the same batch in each experiment. ENZFIT (Elsevier, Cambridge, UK) software was used to determine the transport kinetics for the GLUT7- and mutant-mediated hexose uptake by non-linear regression analysis Western Blotting and Immunohistochemistry—Two polyclonal antibodies were raised against the unique 10-amino acid sequence of the C-terminal tail of GLUT7 (PTASPAKETSF) by Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX. Testing of the affinity-purified product in Western blots indicated that antibody 7440 recognized the expression of GLUT7 protein in plasma membranes of cRNA-injected oocytes but was negative for water-injected oocytes. Oocytes were embedded in OCT™ (10% polyvinyl alcohol, 4% polyethylene glycol) embedding medium (Shandon) and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Ten-micrometer-thick sections were cut on a cryostat (Leica cryostat, Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada), mounted on slides, and stored at -20 °C. On the day of use, sections were brought to room temperature and fixed with methanol for 90 s. Following a 5-min wash with PBS, the sections were treated with 1% SDS for 5 min to increase antigen exposure and then washed with PBS for 5 min three times. The sections were then treated with 10% goat serum (0.1% Tween 20) to decrease nonspecific binding of the secondary antibody followed by a rapid rinse with PBS and incubation with primary antibody. The primary anti-GLUT7 antibody was diluted 1:200 in a 25% w/v milk solution (25 g of powdered milk in 100 ml of PBS with 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with the slides for 24 h at 4 °C followed by washes with high salt (three times normal NaCl) PBS and then PBS. The slides were then incubated with 1 mg/ml biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Chemicon) diluted 1:200 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were washed in high salt PBS followed by normal PBS and then treated with streptavidin-conjugated fluorescein isothiocyanate (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min in the dark. After three 5-min washes with PBS in the dark, the slides were mounted and sealed with nail polish. They were then viewed and photographed under a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM510). Multiple Alignments of GLUT Sequences and Docking Analysis—The sequences of GLUTs 1-5 and 7 were analyzed using CLUSTALX (14Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55766) Google Scholar) software, and the conserved residues of interest were identified. The comparison between the GLUTs 1 and 7 structures around the exofacial vestibule of the aqueous pore were made using the coordinates from the GLUT1 model assigned the name 1SUK 41SUK refers to a GLUT1 homology model deposited in the Protein Data Bank (Ref. 15Salas-Burgos A.

This template structure was subject to a 10-ns molecular dynamics simulation in water/octane and ions, using the force field OPLS (16Jorgensen W.L. Tirado-Rives J. J. Am. Chem.

This run was at a constant number of molecules, pressure, and temperature (Langevin dynamics) with Berendsen coupling for temperature and pressure. All bonds were constrained using the LINCS (17Hess B. Bekker H. Berendsen H.J.C Fraaije J.G.E.M. J. Comput.

The resulting structure was then utilized as template for models of GLUTs 1 and 7, built, and refined with Modeler 7 (20Fiser A. Sali A. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 461-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar) for each structure including the template, following the approach used in reference (15Salas-Burgos A. Iserovich P.

The resulting GLUTs 1 and 7 structures were deposited in the Protein Data Bank, codes 1YG1 and 1YG7, respectively. Docking of β-d-glucose and β-d-fructose (Fig. 1) was explored using Autodock and Autodock tools (21Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9209) Google Scholar) with the GLUTs 1 and 7 structures as the receptors and the hexose structures as predicted by the PRODRG server. Statistical Analysis—Uptake data were analyzed for statistical significance using the two-tailed, unpaired Student t test. Kinetic data and associated errors were analyzed by non-linear regression analysis using ENZFIT, Elsevier. We have shown previously that human GLUT7 can transport both glucose and fructose with high affinity (km of ∼0.2 mm) (12Li Q. Manolescu A. Ritzel M. Yao S. Slugoski M. Young J.D. Chen X.Z. Cheeseman C.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: G236-G242Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Comparison of the sequence alignments of GLUTs 1, 2, 5, and 7 revealed that at the homologous position of the Val-290 in GLUT1, GLUTs 2, 5, and 7 contain an Ile (Ile-306, Ile-321, and Ile-314, respectively) (Fig. 1A). Given that GLUTs 2, 5, and 7 transport fructose and all have this conserved Ile, whereas the GLUTs, which transport glucose, but not fructose, have a Val at the equivalent site, we focused on the possible role of this residue in relation to the substrate specificity of GLUT7. Comparing the previously modeled GLUT1 (assigned as 1SUK, Protein Data Base) (15Salas-Burgos A. Iserovich P. Zuniga F. Vera J.C. Fischbarg J. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2990-2999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) with GLUT7 (1GY7), also obtained using the glycerol phosphate transporter GlpT (1PW4, Protein Data Bank) as a template, it was found that Val-290 and Ile-314 appear to face the aqueous pore (Fig. 1, B and C). Two mutants of human GLUT7 cDNA encoding a point mutation in position 314 were constructed in which the native Ile was replaced with either Val or Ser. After injection of the cRNA into oocytes, the subsequent expression of the mutants in the oocyte plasma membrane was assessed by immunohistochemistry and semiquantitative Western blot analysis of isolated oocyte plasma membranes. Both methods employed a commercially prepared antibody raised against the 10 C-terminal amino acids of the wild type human GLUT7. In all cases, these conservative single amino acid substitutions did not affect expression of the proteins in the oocytes, and all of the mutants were present at levels similar to or even higher than the wild type protein (Fig. 2). To identify any alterations of substrate specificity for mutant proteins, we performed a comparison between the uptake of a series of hexoses by wild type GLUT7 and I314V mutant. There was a striking difference between the wild type GLUT7 and the I314V mutant functional activity, with the mutant being effectively unable to transport fructose, whereas glucose uptake was normal (see Fig. 4). Also, wild type GLUT7 does not transport d-galactose or 2-deoxy-d-glucose, and in this regard, the I314V mutant was no different (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Hexose fluxes in X. laevis oocytes expressing GLUT7 wild type and I314V mutant.

We reported previously that hGLUT7 has a high affinity for glucose and fructose (12Li Q. Manolescu A. Ritzel M. Yao S. Slugoski M. Young J.D. Chen X.Z. Cheeseman C.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: G236-G242Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This was based upon the kinetic analysis of glucose uptake (km ≈ 300 μm) and the ability of fructose to competitively inhibit glucose transport (IC50 60.3 ± 25.8 μm). Therefore, to complete this analysis, we measured the kinetics of fructose uptake by wild type GLUT7 and determined the IC50 for glucose inhibition of fructose uptake. Both sets of experiments confirmed that hGLUT7 has a high affinity for these two hexoses. The km for fructose uptake was 113.9 ± 40.1 μm, n = 3 (Fig. 4), and the IC50 for glucose inhibition of 100 μm fructose transport was found to be 121.8 ± 56.0 μm. Kinetic analysis of glucose transport in the GLUT7 I314V mutant confirmed the initial uptake measurements, using a single glucose concentration, that this point mutation had no effect on glucose transport (Fig. 5). Uptake of glucose over the concentration range 0.05-3.0 mm was curvilinear and, when corrected for uptake into water-injected oocytes, exhibited Michaelis-Menten type kinetics with a Km of 32.7 ± 26.5 μm. Interestingly, glucose (100 μm) transport by this mutant was completely unaffected by the presence of excess cold fructose (10 mm) (Fig. 6), suggesting that fructose either was unable to access the hexose binding site or was no longer recognized.FIGURE 6Effect of the addition of 10 mm fructose upon I314V GLUT7-mediated d-glucose uptake. Uptake of 100 μm [14C]d-glucose (30 min at 22 °C) was determined in the absence or presence of 10 mm unlabeled d-fructose in 10-12 oocytes injected with I314V GLUT7 cRNA.

Substitution of valine for isoleucine in both proteins resulted in a loss of fructose transport (Figs. 7 and 8), and in GLUT2, just as for GLUT7, had no effect on 100 μm glucose uptake (Fig. 7).FIGURE 8d-Fructose transport mediated by wild type hGLUT5 and the I321V mutant.

Therefore, the effect of a substitution of isoleucine with serine at position 314 in GLUT7 was also tested. This was found to have no effect on the specificity of the transporter, with glucose and fructose transport both being retained (Fig. 9). Our simulation of the GLUT7 structure appeared to confirm the overall structural organization of the TMs in this protein as proposed previously for GLUT1, with TM7 forming part of the lining of the aqueous pore (15Salas-Burgos A. Iserovich P. Zuniga F. Vera J.C. Fischbarg J. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2990-2999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). (Note: This recent model has made obsolete all prior GLUT1 models advanced by the same group (22Fischbarg J. Cheung M. Czegledy F. Li J. Iserovich P. Kuang K. Hubbard J. Garner M. Rosen O.M.

Comparison of the sequence alignment of GLUTs 1-7 in the TM7 region showed that, in the position equivalent to Val-290 of GLUT1, GLUTs 2, 5, and 7 have an Ile residue, whereas, in contrast, the other class I GLUTs (1Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 3Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N.

Chem. 2004; 279: 26540-26545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which transport glucose but not fructose, have a Val at this position. This indicated a possible role for the residue at this position in the permeation process and led us to hypothesize that the replacement of Ile with Val would alter the transport properties of GLUTs 7 and 5 and GLUT2. Substitution of Val for Ile in GLUT7 dramatically altered the substrate specificity of the protein, almost completely eliminating the ability to transport fructose, whereas having no effect on the recognition or capacity to move glucose. The other transport characteristics were also identical to the wild type behavior, GLUT7 I314V showing no affinity for 2-deoxyglucose or galactose. Expression of the mutant in the oocyte membrane was also unaffected by this single amino acid substitution, as determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. These results indicated that the recognition, binding, and translocation of the glucose through GLUT7 do not depend on the presence of the Ile at the 314 position. Wild type GLUT7 has the same affinity for glucose and fructose, and these substrates can competitively inhibit each other's transport equally effectively. The simplest interpretation of these observations would be that there is a single binding site that recognizes both hexoses. However, we now have to add another feature that appears to play a role in substrate access and that is the hydrophobic residue found at position 314. Clearly, it cannot form a hydrogen bond with the substrate, and yet it appears to be critical for the transport of fructose, but not glucose. The uptake of glucose by the I314V mutant was unaffected by the presence of 10 mm fructose, suggesting that in some way, this point mutation prevents fructose from accessing the binding site. At the same time, this indicated that this substitution cannot have any major effect on the overall structure or function of the protein. The differences in the size for Val and Ile are minor, with molecular volumes of 140 and 166.7 Å3; consequently, the global protein energy of GLUT7 is expected to vary very little when Val is substituted by Ile, about 10 kB·T (the Boltzmann constant times temperature). Using molecular dynamics and energy minimization algorithms in a system already used to model GLUT1 (15Salas-Burgos A. Iserovich P. Zuniga F. Vera J.C. Fischbarg J. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2990-2999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), we have produced a putative three-dimensional structure for GLUT7. The model was created using fixed coordinates of the already crystallized E. coli protein GlpT and adjusted using homology modeling from the template after 10 ns of simulations. The position of isoleucine 314 is shown (Fig. 1C) as facing the aqueous pore and within the outer-facing vestibule. There also appears to be a tryptophan residue on the other side of the vestibule, contributed by TM2 (Trp-89), which could form a hydrophobic interaction with Ile-314, producing a narrowing of the pore (Fig. 1C). The docking model further suggested that for the hexose substrates to move forward into the channel and reach the binding site, they first have to pass through this narrow passage. This hypothesis would indicate that a very specific orientation of fructose or glucose is required to allow them to access the binding site(s) within the channel. Interestingly, when we compare the GLUT7 structure with that of GLUT1, in which valine (Val-290) can also interact with the same conserved tryptophan residue, we see an even narrower passage (4.4 versus 5.2 Å, Fig. 1, B and C). Finally, the docking simulation also predicts a quite different orientation for fructose (Fig. 1C) when compared with glucose (Fig. 1B) as they bind below the vestibule, suggesting that fructose needs a wider opening to be able to enter the pore and complete the transport cycle. To further test this hypothesis, we replaced Ile-314 with Ser, which has a smaller size and length of the side chain (residual volume 89 and surface area of 115) and is a hydrophilic residue. Our data showed an increase in both glucose and fructose transport in the GLUT7 I314S mutant. Ser is shorter than Ile and will not be able interact hydrophobically with Trp-89, allowing TMs 7 and 2 to “relax.” Thus, the vestibule would be opened up, allowing easier entry of both substrates. We also extended our study to GLUTs 2 and 5, which are also known to be able to transport fructose (24Cheeseman C.I. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 1050-1056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 25Burant C.F. Takeda J. Brot-Laroche E. Bell G.I. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14523-14526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and which have Ile at the position equivalent to 314. Both proteins lost the ability to recognize fructose when Val was substituted for Ile, whereas the ability of GLUT2 to transport glucose was again unaffected by this substitution. These observations confirmed that Ile-314 is critical for fructose transport by the GLUTs tested to date. There are many examples of significant effects on the functionality of SLC2A proteins when hydrophobic residues are mutated (4Alisio A. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26540-26545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26Kusari J. Verma U.S. Buse J.B. Henry R.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Clin.

One of the most frequent missense mutations encountered in De Vivo syndrome (a GLUT1 deficiency syndrome hypoglycorrhachia, and reduced erythrocyte glucose transport) is where the hydrophilic residue Thr-310 is replaced by an Ile (28Iserovich P. Wang D. Ma L. Yang H. Zuniga F.A. Pascual J.M. Kuang K. De Vivo D.C. Fischbarg J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30991-30997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thr-310 is conserved in human GLUTs 1-9 and also across many other species (29Bell G.I. Kayano T. Buse J.B. Burant C.F. Takeda J. Lin D. Fukumoto H. Seino S. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), suggesting that this residue may play an important role in glucose permeation. Also, when an experimental substitution of V197I was made in GLUT2, a severe reduction in glucose transport resulted (7Mueckler M. Kruse M. Strube M. Riggs A.C. Chiu K.C. Permutt M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17765-17767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From these examples, it is clear that the role of the hydrophobic residues in the biologically active conformation of the SLC2A membrane proteins is more complex than just creating a hydrophobic well inside the pore, but their structural importance is not yet fully understood. It could involve subtle changes in helix packing, changing the shape of the pore, and/or provide more direct interactions of the amino acid side chain with the substrate giving rise to steric hindrance. Our data indicated that isoleucine 314 in GLUT7 may form part of a substrate selectivity filter within the exofacial vestibule proximal to the binding site(s) and prior to translocation.

https://openalex.org/W2039608261,"Riboflavin kinases catalyze synthesis of FMN from riboflavin and ATP. These enzymes have to date been cloned from bacteria, yeast, and mammals, but not from plants. Bioinformatic approaches suggested that diverse plant species, including many angiosperms, two gymnosperms, a moss (Physcomitrella patens), and a unicellular green alga (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), encode proteins that are homologous to riboflavin kinases of yeast and mammals, but contain an N-terminal domain that belongs to the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily of enzymes. The Arabidopsis homolog of these proteins was cloned by RT-PCR, and was shown to have riboflavin kinase and FMN hydrolase activities by characterizing the recombinant enzyme produced in Escherichia coli. Both activities of the purified recombinant Arabidopsis enzyme (AtFMN/FHy) increased when the enzyme assays contained 0.02% Tween 20. The FMN hydrolase activity of AtFMN/FHy greatly decreased when EDTA replaced Mg2+ in the assays, as expected for a member of the Mg2+-dependent haloacid dehalogenase family. The functional overexpression of the individual domains in E. coli establishes that the riboflavin kinase and FMN hydrolase activities reside, respectively, in the C-terminal (AtFMN) and N-terminal (AtFHy) domains of AtFMN/FHy. Biochemical characterization of AtFMN/FHy, AtFMN, and AtFHy shows that the riboflavin kinase and FMN hydrolase domains of AtFMN/FHy can be physically separated, with little change in their kinetic properties."
https://openalex.org/W2072765240,"Excessive accumulation of the extracellular matrix is a hallmark of many inflammatory and fibrotic diseases, including those of the kidney. This study addresses the question whether NO, in addition to inhibiting the expression of MMP-9, a prominent metalloprotease expressed by mesangial cells, additionally modulates expression of its endogenous inhibitor TIMP-1. We demonstrate that exogenous NO has no modulatory effect on the extracellular TIMP-1 content but strongly amplifies the early increase in cytokine-induced TIMP-1 mRNA and protein levels. We examined whether transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta), a potent profibrotic cytokine, is involved in the regulation of NO-dependent TIMP-1 expression. Experiments utilizing a pan-specific neutralizing TGFbeta antibody demonstrate that the NO-induced amplification of TIMP-1 is mediated by extracellular TGFbeta. Mechanistically, NO causes a rapid increase in Smad-2 phosphorylation, which is abrogated by the addition of neutralizing TGFbeta antisera. Similarly, the NO-dependent increase in Smad-2 phosphorylation is prevented in the presence of an inhibitor of TGFbeta-RI kinase, indicating that the NO-dependent activation of Smad-2 occurs via the TGFbeta-type I receptor. Furthermore, activation of the Smad signaling cascade by NO is corroborated by the NO-dependent increase in nuclear Smad-4 level and is paralleled by increased DNA binding of Smad-2/3 containing complexes to a TIMP-1-specific Smad-binding element (SBE). Reporter gene assays revealed that NO activates a 0.6-kb TIMP-1 gene promoter fragment as well as a TGFbeta-inducible and SBE-driven control promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis also demonstrated DNA binding activity of Smad-3 and Smad-4 proteins to the TIMP-1-specific SBE. Finally, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we demonstrated that NO causes a rapid increase in TGFbeta(1) levels in cell supernatants. Together, these experiments demonstrate that NO by induction of the Smad signaling pathway modulates TIMP-1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W1968027136,"MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) are negative regulators of MAPKs. Previously, we identified NtMKP1 as a novel calmodulin (CaM)-binding protein (Yamakawa, H., Katou, S., Seo, S., Mitsuhara, I., Kamada, H., and Ohashi, Y. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 928-936). In this study, we characterized the interaction of NtMKP1 with substrate MAPKs and CaM. NtMKP1 (produced by in vitro transcription/translation) inactivated salicylic acid-induced protein kinase (SIPK) through dephosphorylation of the TEY motif of SIPK. CaM bound but unexpectedly did not activate the phosphatase activity of NtMKP1. NtMKP1 has four characteristic domains, viz. a dual-specificity phosphatase catalytic domain, a gelsolin homology domain, a CaM-binding domain, and C-terminal domain. Deletion analysis revealed that the N-terminal non-catalytic region of NtMKP1 bound SIPK and was essential for inactivating SIPK, whereas the CaM-binding and C-terminal domains were dispensable. Moreover, the phosphatase activity of NtMKP1 was increased strongly by the binding of SIPK, but weakly by another MAPK, wound-induced protein kinase. Swapping and site-directed mutagenesis of SIPK and wound-induced protein kinase revealed that the strong activation of NtMKP1 phosphatase activity by SIPK partially depended on the putative common docking domain of SIPK. On the other hand, conversion of Lys41 and Arg43 of NtMKP1 to Ala (K41A/R43A) abolished the interaction with SIPK. Expression of constitutively active MAPK kinase in Nicotiana benthamiana induced activation of SIPK and cell death. Simultaneous expression of either NtMKP1 or NtMKP1 L443R, which was unable to bind CaM, compromised the constitutively active MAPK kinase-induced responses, whereas that of NtMKP1 K41A/R43A did not. These results indicate that the regulation of NtMKP1 activity by SIPK binding, but not by CaM binding, is important for the function of NtMKP1.

The activity of MAPKs is strictly regulated via phosphorylation of the conserved TXY motif by an upstream MAPK kinase (MAPKK) (1Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar, 2Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar). Conversely, MAPKs are dephosphorylated and inactivated by protein phosphatases, including tyrosine-specific phosphatases; serine/threonine-specific phosphatases; and dual-specificity MAPK phosphatases (MKPs), which are highly specific to MAPKs (3Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 4Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin.

In mammals, the 14 members of the MAPK family represent three major subfamilies, viz. ERK, JNK, and p38 (1Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar, 2Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the mammalian MKP family has 10 members, which share sequence homology, but differ in substrate specificity and subcellular localization (3Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 4Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 5Theodosiou A. Ashworth A. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 1-10Crossref Google Scholar). Mammalian MKPs interact with their substrate MAPKs via a substrate-binding domain at their N termini, and such an interaction increases the catalytic activity of some MKPs. This “substrate-triggered activation” of MKP phosphatase activity has been shown to play an important role in determining substrate specificity at the subfamily level (6Camps M. Nichols A.

However, no obvious JNK or p38 type of MAPK has been identified in plants. The Arabidopsis genome contains 20 MAPKs, 12 of which are the ERK type, and the others are the plant-specific type (10MAPK GroupTrends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 301-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). In contrast to many members of the MAPK family, plant MKPs likely form a small gene family. Only five MKPs are predicted in the Arabidopsis genome, including the previously reported AtMKP1, IBR5, PHS1, and DsPTP1 (11Kerk D. Bulgrien J. Smith D.W. Barsam B. Veretnik S. Gribskov M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 908-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This disproportionate ratio of MAPK to MKP may suggest that one MKP regulates multiple MAPKs in plants and that other types of protein phosphatases such as protein phosphatase 2C (12Meskiene I. Baudouin E. Schweighofer A. Liwosz A. Jonak C. Rodriguez P.L. Jelinek H. Hirt H. J. Biol.

Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) also play an important role in the regulation of plant MAPKs. Mutation of the AtMKP1, IBR5, and PHS1 genes causes sensitivity to genotoxic stress, reduced responses to the phytohormones auxin and abscisic acid, and compromised cortical microtubule functions, respectively (14Ulm R. Revenkova E. di Sansebastiano G.-P. Bechtold N. Paszkowski J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 15Monroe-Augustus M. Zolman B.K. Bartel B.

This genetic evidence clearly reveals the important biological role of plant MKPs. However, the biochemical characteristics of plant MKPs are not well understood. Although yeast two-hybrid analysis showed that AtMKP1 specifically interacts with AtMPK3, AtMPK4, and AtMPK6 among AtMPK1-9 (17Ulm R. Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Peck S.C. Zhu T. Wang X. Shinozaki K. Paszkowski J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6483-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), the phosphatase activity of AtMKP1 and IBR5 has not been proven. PHS1 has general phosphatase activity as shown by the hydrolysis of an artificial substrate, but its target MAPK is unclear (16Naoi K. Hashimoto T. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1841-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). DsPTP1 dephosphorylates and inactivates AtMPK4 in vitro; however, it has been suggested that DsPTP1 is unlikely to inactivate AtMPK4 in vivo (13Huang Y. Li H. Gupta R. Morris P.C. Luan S. Kieber J.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 18Gupta R. Huang Y. Kieber J. Luan S. Plant J. 1998; 16: 581-589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we identified a putative tobacco ortholog of AtMKP1 (NtMKP1) as a calmodulin (CaM)-binding protein (19Yamakawa H. Katou S. Seo S. Mitsuhara I. Kamada H. Ohashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 928-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that CaM binds two different sites of DsPTP1 (20Yoo J.H. Cheong M.S. Park C.Y. Moon B.C. Kim M.C. Kang Y.H. Park H.C. Choi M.S. Lee J.H. Jung W.Y. Yoon H.W. Chung W.S. Lim C.O. Lee S.Y. Cho M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 848-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To date, no MKP from organisms other than plants has been shown to bind CaM. Therefore, interaction with CaM seems to be a unique feature of plant MKPs. Compared with mammalian MKPs, NtMKP1 and AtMKP1 are large proteins carrying several characteristic domains, viz. a dual-specificity phosphatase domain, a gelsolin homology (GH) domain, a CaM-binding domain, and a long C-terminal domain containing a serine-rich region (see Fig. 4A). In tobacco, two MAPKs, salicylic acid-induced protein kinase (SIPK) and wound-induced protein kinase (WIPK), are activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli, including wounding (21Seo S. Sano H. Ohashi Y. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 22Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 2000; 27: 65-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We showed previously that overexpression of NtMKP1 compromises wound-induced activation of SIPK and WIPK, suggesting a role for NtMKP1 in regulating these MAPKs in vivo (19Yamakawa H. Katou S. Seo S. Mitsuhara I. Kamada H. Ohashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 928-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In fact, the activity of AtMPK6, the Arabidopsis ortholog of SIPK, is stronger in an atmkp1 loss-of-function mutant than in the wild type (17Ulm R. Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Peck S.C. Zhu T. Wang X. Shinozaki K. Paszkowski J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6483-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These results indicate that SIPK is a physiological substrate of NtMKP1. Previously, we failed to detect the phosphatase activity of NtMKP1 (19Yamakawa H. Katou S. Seo S. Mitsuhara I. Kamada H. Ohashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 928-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that NtMKP1 is an active MAPK phosphatase, we produced the NtMKP1 protein by in vitro transcription/translation. We also prepared phosphorylated SIPK as a substrate of NtMKP1. Here, we show that NtMKP1 is an active phosphatase that dephosphorylates the conserved TEY motif of SIPK in vitro. The N-terminal non-catalytic region of NtMKP1 interacted with SIPK and was essential for inactivating SIPK. Moreover, the phosphatase activity of NtMKP1 was significantly increased by the binding of SIPK. We show that the catalytic activation of NtMKP1 by SIPK, but not by CaM, is important for the function of NtMKP1 both in vitro and in vivo. Plant Materials—Nicotiana benthamiana was grown in a temperature-controlled growth room maintained at 25 °C with a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle. Four- to five-week-old plants were used for experiments. Production of Recombinant Proteins of MAPKs and Constitutively Active MAPKKs—The open reading frames of SIPK and WIPK were amplified by PCR with MscI and XhoI sites attached to the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, and cloned into the corresponding sites of the pET32a vector (Novagen), allowing the production of each MAPK with a thioredoxin tag at the N terminus and a His6 tag at the C terminus. The open reading frame of MEKDD, a constitutively active form of StMEK1 (23Katou S. Yamamoto A. Yoshioka H. Kawakita K. Doke N. J. Gen. Plant Pathol. 2003; 69: 161-168Google Scholar), was amplified by PCR with NcoI and HindIII sites attached to the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, and cloned into the corresponding sites of pET32a (Novagen), allowing the production of MEKDD with a thioredoxin tag, a His6 tag, and an S·tag at the N terminus. The resulting constructs were used to transform Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen). The conditions used to induce expression of recombinant proteins were as follows: SIPK, (S/W)IPK, SIPKN, and SIPKNN, 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 26 °C for 3 h; WIPK, 0.05 mm IPTG at 20 °C for 20 h; (W/S)IPK, 0.01 mm IPTG at 20 °C for 20 h; and MEKDD, 0.5 mm IPTG at 26 °C for 3 h. Purification of His6-tagged proteins with a nickel-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Purified proteins were desalted on a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl and concentrated using a Microcon YM-30 concentrator (Amicon, Inc.). The autophosphorylation and myelin basic protein (MBP) phosphorylation activities of SIPK and WIPK were assayed as follows. Purified recombinant SIPK and WIPK (0.4 μg each) were incubated at 25 °C for 15 min in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mg/ml MBP, 50 μm ATP, and 50 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Phosphorylated SIPK, WIPK, and MBP were visualized by autoradiography after separation on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Phosphorylation of SIPK by MEKDD—Purified SIPK (50 μg/ml) and MEKDD (10 μg/ml) were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 500 μm ATP. Two-hundred microliters of 50% S protein-agarose (Novagen) was added to the reaction mixture to remove MEKDD. The mixture was rotated at room temperature for 30 min, and the agarose beads were removed by brief centrifugation. The resulting supernatant containing phosphorylated SIPK was concentrated using a Microcon YM-30 concentrator, mixed with an equal volume of glycerol, and stored at -80 °C. Inactivation of SIPK by NtMKP1 Produced by in Vitro Transcription/Translation—The open reading frame of NtMKP1 was fused at its N terminus to a FLAG epitope (FLAG-MKP1) and cloned into the in vitro translation vector pTnT (Promega). In vitro transcription/translation was performed using a TnT wheat germ extract kit (Promega) at 30 °C for 2 h according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In vitro translated products were diluted with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100) containing 1 mm EGTA and 1× Complete (Roche Applied Science); 2 μl of anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma) was added; and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Then, 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added, and the reaction mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. Note that anti-FLAG antibody M2 is isotype 1 of mouse immunoglobulin G and binds protein G stronger than protein A. However, protein G-Sepharose had greater nonspecific binding in our assay system. Therefore, we used protein A-Sepharose to precipitate anti-FLAG antibody M2. The beads were collected by brief centrifugation and washed three times with 1 ml of buffer A containing 1 mm EGTA and twice with buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Then, the beads were suspended in buffer B containing 5 μg/ml phosphorylated SIPK and incubated at ambient temperature with continuous agitation. At specific times, reaction mixtures were flash-centrifuged, and supernatants containing SIPK were removed. The kinase activities of SIPK were assayed at ambient temperature for 10 min with 0.25 mg/ml MBP, 50 μm ATP, and 5 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer. The phosphorylation of MBP was analyzed by autoradiography after separation on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. To investigate the effect of CaM, 1 μm NtCaM1, NtCaM3, or NtCaM13 was added to the reaction mixture in the presence (100 μm CaCl2) or absence (5 mm EGTA) of Ca2+. Interaction of FLAG-MKP1 with NtCaM1—FLAG-MKP1 was produced by in vitro transcription/translation and purified. FLAG-MKP1 bound to Sepharose was suspended in 0.5 μm NtCaM1 in buffer A containing 100 μm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA and rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were collected by brief centrifugation and washed three times with 1 ml of buffer A containing 100 μm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA. The beads were suspended in SDS sample buffer and used for immunoblot analyses with anti-NtCaM1 or anti-NtMKP1 antibody, respectively. The CaM overlay assay was performed as described previously (19Yamakawa H. Katou S. Seo S. Mitsuhara I. Kamada H. Ohashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 928-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), but 1 μg/ml alkaline phosphatase-labeled NtCaM1 was used. Production of Recombinant NtMKP1 Proteins in E. coli—The cDNA fragments corresponding to residues 1-114 and 115-361 of NtMKP1 were amplified by PCR with BamHI and XhoI sites attached to the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, and cloned into the corresponding sites of pGEX-4T-1, resulting in glutathione S-transferase (GST)-MKP1-(1-114) and GST-MKP1-(115-361), respectively. GST-MKP1-(1-114) and GST-MKP1-(115-361) were expressed in E. coli strain RosettaT-M(DE3) (Novagen) and purified with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. GST-MKP1, GST-MKP1-(1-276), GST-MKP1-(1-361), GST-MKP1-(362-467), and GST-MKP1-(468-862) were expressed and purified as described previously (19Yamakawa H. Katou S. Seo S. Mitsuhara I. Kamada H. Ohashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 928-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The inactivation of SIPK by GST-MKP1 derivatives bound to glutathione-Sepharose was performed similarly to the inactivation by FLAG-MKP1. Production and Purification of Antibody and Immunoblot Analyses—Polyclonal antiserum was raised in rabbits using GST-MKP1-(1-114) as an antigen. Purification of anti-NtMKP1 antibody was performed as follows. The cDNA fragment corresponding to residues 1-114 of NtMKP1 was amplified by PCR with XhoI sites attached to the 5′- and 3′-ends and cloned into the corresponding sites of the pET15b vector, allowing the production of N-terminally His6-tagged NtMKP1-(1-114). The resulting construct was used to transform E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen). The recombinant protein was induced to express with 1 mm IPTG at 37 °C for 3 h and purified with a nickel-Sepharose column according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Purified His6-tagged NtMKP1-(1-114) protein (1-2 mg) was coupled to an N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-NtMKP1 antiserum was applied to the column and washed extensively with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 m NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100. Bound antibodies were eluted with 0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 3) and immediately neutralized. For immunoblot analyses, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.). After blocking with nonfat milk, membranes were probed with 1 μg/ml affinity-purified anti-NtMKP1 antibody, 1 μg/ml anti-FLAG antibody M2, 5000-1 anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), anti-SIPK antiserum (24Seo S. Okamoto M. Iwai T. Iwano M. Fukui K. Isogai A. Nakajima N. Ohashi Y. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 917-932PubMed Google Scholar), or anti-NtCaM1 antiserum (25Yamakawa H. Mitsuhara I. Ito N. Seo S. Kamada H. Ohashi Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3916-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). After washing, membranes were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-labeled secondary antibody. The antigen-antibody complexes were detected by hydrolysis of nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as the substrate. Phosphatase Assay Using 3-O-Methylfluorescein Phosphate (OMFP) as a Substrate—The phosphatase activity of GST-MKP1 was assayed at 30 °C in 100 μl of reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 500 μm OMFP. The amount of 3-O-methylfluorescein was determined from the absorbance at 477 nm. The non-enzymatic hydrolysis of OMFP was corrected by measuring the control reaction without enzyme. To investigate the effect of CaM, EDTA was omitted from the reaction, and recombinant NtCaM1, NtCaM3, or NtCaM13 was added to the reaction in the presence (100 μm CaCl2) or absence (5 mm EGTA) of Ca2+. Agroinfiltration—For agroinfiltration experiments, the open reading frames of SIPK, FLAG-MEKDD, and FLAG-MKP1 derivatives were cloned into the multiple cloning sites of the binary vector pEl2Ω (26Ohtsubo N. Mitsuhara I. Koga M. Seo S. Ohashi Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 808-817Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Various mutations were generated using a Mutan-Super Express Km kit (Takara) and confirmed by sequencing. The constructs were used to transform Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1 by electroporation. Agrobacterium cells were cultured; harvested by centrifugation; suspended in 10 mm MES-NaOH (pH 5.6), 10 mm MgCl2, and 150 μm acetosyringone to A600 = 1.0; incubated at room temperature for 2 h; and infiltrated into leaves of N. benthamiana (4-5 weeks old) using a syringe without a needle. For simultaneous expression, Agrobacterium cells carrying the vector control or FLAG-MKP1 derivatives were mixed with 0.0526 volume of Agrobacterium cells carrying FLAG-MEKDD immediately before infiltration. Under this condition, accumulation of MEKDD was still three to four times higher than that of MKP1 as judged by immunoblot analysis with anti-FLAG antibody. The activity of SIPK was measured 2 days after infiltration by immunocomplex kinase assay as described previously (21Seo S. Sano H. Ohashi Y. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Precipitation of SIPK by GST-fused NtMKP1 Derivatives—Total protein was extracted from N. benthamiana leaves infiltrated with Agrobacterium cells carrying SIPK 2 days after infiltration as described previously (21Seo S. Sano H. Ohashi Y. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Total protein was mixed with GST alone or GST-MKP1 derivatives bound to glutathione-Sepharose and rotated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Triton X-100. Precipitated proteins were denatured with SDS sample buffer and used for immunoblotting. Construction of (S/W)IPK, (W/S)IPK, SIPKN, and SIPKNN—(S/W)IPK and (W/S)IPK were constructed as reported by Zhang and Liu (27Zhang S. Liu Y. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1877-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). A PstI site introduced into the WIPK gene does not change the amino acid sequence. Various mutations were generated using the Mutan-Super Express Km kit and confirmed by sequencing. NtMKP1 Inactivates SIPK via Dephosphorylation of the Conserved TEY Motif in Vitro—To determine the phosphatase activity of NtMKP1, we prepared phosphorylated SIPK as a substrate of NtMKP1. Recombinant SIPK and MEKDD, a constitutively active form of StMEK1 MAPKK that activates SIPK in N. benthamiana (23Katou S. Yamamoto A. Yoshioka H. Kawakita K. Doke N. J. Gen. Plant Pathol. 2003; 69: 161-168Google Scholar, 28Kanzaki H. Saitoh H. Ito A. Fujisawa S. Kamoun S. Katou S. Yoshioka H. Terauchi R. Mol.

G.): 706-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), were expressed in E. coli and purified by nickel affinity column chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of purified fractions detected a single band on the gels (Fig. 1A). Phosphorylation of SIPK by MEKDD enhanced the activity of SIPK for MBP by ∼50-100-fold. After the reaction, MEKDD was removed by S protein-Sepharose. Recombinant NtMKP1 was produced as an N-terminal FLAG fusion protein (FLAG-MKP1) by in vitro transcription/translation using wheat germ extract. The production of FLAG-MKP1 was confirmed by immunoblot analyses using antibodies against NtMKP1 and FLAG. Both antibodies recognized a protein of ∼100 kDa, which corresponds to the predicted molecular mass of FLAG-MKP1 (96.6 kDa) (Fig. 1B). FLAG-MKP1 was purified from wheat germ extract by immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibody and protein A-Sepharose, and the beads were washed with buffer containing EGTA to remove wheat germ CaM. The Sepharose beads attached to FLAG-MKP1 were suspended in buffer containing phosphorylated SIPK and incubated with gentle agitation. At specific times, FLAG-MKP1 bound to the beads was removed by brief centrifugation, and the kinase activity of the supernatant containing SIPK was measured using MBP as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 1C, SIPK activity was decreased by incubation with FLAG-MKP1 within 15 min, whereas the amount of SIPK protein was constant, demonstrating that NtMKP1 inactivates SIPK in vitro. The activity of MAPK is strictly correlated with the phosphorylation of the conserved TXY motif. SIPK activity is also regulated by the phosphorylation of the TEY motif (27Zhang S. Liu Y. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1877-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We investigated whether NtMKP1 inactivates SIPK via dephosphorylation of the conserved TEY motif by conducting an immunoblot analysis using anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody, which specifically recognizes the phosphorylated form of the TEY motif of mammalian ERK MAPK. Although this antibody has been used to monitor the phosphorylation of SIPK (30Lebrun-Garcia A. Ouaked F. Chiltz A. Pugin A. Plant J. 1998; 15: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 31Samuel M.A. Miles G.P. Ellis B.E. Plant J. 2000; 22: 367-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Samuel M.A. Ellis B.E. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2059-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we first confirmed the specificity of the antibody in an immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A, anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody recognized SIPK phosphorylated by MEKDD, but not non-phosphorylated SIPK. We then investigated whether FLAG-MKP1 dephosphorylates the TEY motif of SIPK in vitro. The phosphorylation of the conserved TEY motif of SIPK decreased upon incubation with FLAG-MKP1, whereas the amount of SIPK protein was constant (Fig. 2B). Collectively, these results indicate that NtMKP1 inactivates SIPK via dephosphorylation of its TEY motif. Calmodulin Binds but Does Not Activate FLAG-MKP1—In a previous study, we identified NtMKP1 as a CaM-binding protein (19Yamakawa H. Katou S. Seo S. Mitsuhara I. Kamada H. Ohashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 928-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We first confirmed the interaction of FLAG-MKP1 with NtCaM1. NtCaM1 was mixed with FLAG-MKP1 bound to Sepharose beads in the presence or absence of Ca2+. Precipitated NtCaM1 was detected by immunoblot analysis using antibody against NtCaM1. As shown in Fig. 3A, NtCaM1 was precipitated by FLAG-MKP1 in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Previously, we showed that Trp440 and Leu443, but not Gly450, are essential for the GST-fused CaM-binding domain of NtMKP1 to bind CaM (19Yamakawa H. Katou S. Seo S. Mitsuhara I. Kamada H. Ohashi Y.

Using patch clamp electrophysiological techniques, we assayed pore formation by PA in real time on the surface of cultured cells. The membranes of CHO-K1 cells treated with activated PA had little to no electrical conductivity at neutral pH (7.3) but exhibited robust mixed ionic currents in response to voltage stimuli at pH 5.3. Pore formation depended on specific cellular receptors and exhibited voltage-dependent inactivation at large potentials (>60 mV). The pH requirement for pore formation was receptor-specific as membrane insertion occurs at significantly different pH values when measured in cells specifically expressing tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8) or capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2), the two known cellular receptors for anthrax toxin.

PA is an 83-kDa protein that binds either of two known cellular receptors, capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2) (4Scobie H.M. Rainey G.J. Bradley K.A. Young J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 2001; 414: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Cleavage of PA at a furin-sensitive site follows receptor binding and releases an N-terminal 20-kDa fragment, leaving a mature 63-kDa protein bound to the receptor (6Klimpel K.R. Molloy S.S. Thomas G. Leppla S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). This allows interaction with other cleaved PA molecules and leads to the formation of ring-shaped, heptameric “prepore” structures on the cell surface (7Milne J.C. Furlong D. Hanna P.C. Wall J.S. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20607-20612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LF and EF bind competitively to the prepore, and the resulting complexes are internalized by endocytosis (8Gordon V.M. Leppla S.H. Hewlett E.L. Infect.

Endosome acidification by a vesicular membrane proton pump induces a conformational change in the prepore that allows it to form a membrane-spanning pore (10Milne J.C. Collier R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). LF and EF are believed to translocate through this pore to the cytosol.

Nassi S. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8371-8376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and from experiments in planar lipid bilayers (12Zhang S. Udho E. Wu Z.

Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. Science. 2005; 309: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The biophysical properties of PA pores have been partially characterized in planar lipid bilayers (14Blaustein R.O. Koehler T.M. Collier R.J. Finkelstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pore formation is dependent on pretreatment of PA with trypsin to yield the active 63-kDa species and also on acidic pH on the side of the membrane (cis) to which the protein is added. The observed membrane currents show relatively nonselective, large-conductance pores that are blocked especially well by tetraalkylammonium ions. Planar lipid bilayers have also been used to study translocation of LF and EF (12Zhang S. Udho E. Wu Z. Collier R.J. Finkelstein A. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 3842-3849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 13Krantz B.A. Melnyk R.A Zhang S. Juris S.J. Lacy D.B. Wu Z. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. Science. 2005; 309: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). A real-time cellular assay for translocation would complement planar lipid bilayer studies. Importantly, PA monomer addition to artificial membranes results in pore formation in the absence of cellular receptors, but receptor-deficient cells are unaffected by anthrax toxin (5Bradley K.A. Mogridge J. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Young J.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Because the cellular receptors for PA may form some structural component of the pore in vivo (18Lacy D.B. Wigelsworth D.J. Melnyk R.A. Harrison S.C. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 2004; 430: 905-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and because of differences in lipid composition, it is reasonable to ask whether the overall structure of the pores formed in artificial membranes accurately reflects that found in plasma or endosomal membranes. A second consideration is the possibility that in vivo translocation involves additional cellular factors. Translocation of the related Pseudomonas exotoxin A (20Taupiac M.P. Alami M. Beaumelle B. J.

Naturally, if additional and unknown cellular factors are necessary, reconstitution of the translocation process in vitro becomes more difficult. Our ultimate goal was to develop a patch clamp-based assay to measure LF or EF translocation in real time. Here we used whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology to characterize PA pores in cell membranes. We showed that pore formation in plasma membranes requires cellular receptors, and we measured basic biophysical properties of these pores, comparing our recordings with those made in artificial bilayers. We found that the pores are effectively blocked by tetrabutylammonium ions and the N-terminal, PA-binding domain of LF. Lastly, using engineered cell lines, we found that pore formation is pH-dependent but that the dependence ultimately resides in the receptor for PA. Materials—Proteins were produced and purified as described previously (23Christensen K.A. Krantz B.A. Melnyk R.A. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1047-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Highly concentrated, trypsin-activated PA was diluted to 1 μm in 20 Tris/150 NaCl solution, pH 8.5, and added to cultured cells to a final concentration of 10 nm, at 4 °C for 1 h prior to experiments. Cell Culture—CHO-R1.1 cells stably expressing either human CMG2 or human TEM8 (24Rainey G.J.A. Wigelsworth D.J. Ryan P.L. Scobie H.M. Collier R.J. Young J.A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) were maintained under G418 selection (600 μg/ml; Invitrogen) and cultured in carbonate-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, under 7% CO2. Cells were seeded onto round coverslips 12-36 h before recording. Solutions—Solutions were designed to mimic physiological conditions and allow pH manipulation. Extracellular (bath) solutions contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 MES, and 10 dextrose. In HEPES-free externals, Bis-Tris was substituted for HEPES. Solutions were adjusted to pH values between 4.9 and 7.3 with NaOH. Internal (pipette) solution contained (in mm): 110 KCl, 10 EGTA, 5 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES. HEPES-free internal was 145 KCl, 2 sodium citrate, 1 EGTA. Internals were adjusted to pH 7.2 with HCl. Calculated free calcium was 195 nm in the HEPES-containing solution using Maxchelator's WEBMAXC standard. A stock solution of 1 m 2-deoxy-d-glucose, 200 mm sodium azide, and 4 μm bafilomycin A1 (all from Sigma) was diluted into cell cultures (1:20) 45 min prior to incubation with PA. Electrophysiology—Whole-cell recordings were made using an EPC-9 (HEKA Electronics) amplifier, and data were acquired using Pulse software (HEKA Electronics). Current traces were acquired between 0.5 and 20 kHz, depending on the protocol, and filtered at 2.9 kHz. The holding potential was 0 mV. The intersweep interval was 5 s. Pipettes were pulled from filamented glass capillary tubes (1B150F-4; World Precision Instruments) with resistances that ranged from 2.2 to 4.0 m. Toxin-treated cells were transferred to a recording chamber. All experiments were performed at room temperature (22-24 °C). Bath solution changes were accomplished by gravity perfusion, and LFN was added directly by pipette. Planar lipid bilayers were painted onto a 200-μm aperture of a 1-ml Delrin cup, using 3% 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine in n-decane. The cis (side to which PA and tetrabutylammonium (TBA) were added) chamber contained extracellular solution, pH 5.3. The trans chamber contained pipette solution, pH 7.2. Trypsin-activated PA was added to a concentration of 90 pm. Macroscopic currents were recorded using a Warner bilayer clamp BC-525C (Warner Instruments) and an ITC-16 interface (Instrutech) at 50 Hz in response to voltage commands using an Axograph 4.0 (Axon Instruments). Indicated voltages refer to the trans chamber. Data Analysis—Analysis was performed using Pulse software and Microsoft Excel. Current amplitudes at -100 mV were averaged over a 100-ms period preceding the voltage-ramp. For I-V plots showing inactivation, amplitudes were averaged over a 60-ms period at the beginning and end of the voltage step. The periods were chosen to avoid capacitative transients. To calculate the percentage of inactivation, current at 0 mV was subtracted from both data sets. Data for TBA inhibition and the pH dependence of pore insertion were fit using the Sigmoidal Dose Response fitting tool in Origin (OriginLab Corp.) with upper and lower asymptotes fixed at 1 and 0, respectively. We chose CHO-K1 cells for these studies because of their demonstrated susceptibility to anthrax toxin and because they exhibit few endogenous membrane conductances. Nonetheless, because we expected pore formation by PA to be pH-dependent, we characterized the properties of CHO-K1 cell membranes at acidic pH. Fig. 1A shows that at neutral (7.3) pH, these membranes are electrically silent when subjected to a 2-s voltage-ramp from -100 to +100 mV. When the cell chamber was perfused with the same solution at pH 5.0, however, a large, outwardly rectifying current appeared. This current, which varied in amplitude from cell to cell, is similar to a proton-activated chloride current previously observed in CHO-K1 cells (25Xu H. Jin J. DeFelice L.J. Andrews N.C. Clapham D.E. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E50Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To determine whether PA forms ion-conducting pores in CHO-K1 cell membranes under similar conditions, we incubated the cells with trypsin-activated PA monomers (10 nm) prior to recording and repeated the experiment. Fig. 1B shows that when the bath pH was lowered to 5.0 in the presence of PA, a new conductance emerged. In the presence of extracellular chloride ions, both inward and outward current developed as pH was lowered. When sulfate was substituted for chloride in the extracellular solution, the outward current decreased at the most positive potentials, and the resulting steady-state current was S-shaped. Offline subtraction of the current recorded in the absence of chloride from the initial current, recorded in the presence of chloride, yielded a current almost identical to that shown in Fig. 1A. The current that persisted in the absence of chloride at acidic pH (PA current) was only observed after prior incubation with PA, and its reversal potential was around -12 mV, consistent with conductance of mixed cations. The peculiar shape of the I-V relation shown in Fig. 1B resembles that initially observed for PA in planar lipid bilayers (14Blaustein R.O. Koehler T.M. Collier R.J. Finkelstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2209-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Inward conductance is not linear, probably due to voltage-dependent blockade by HEPES present in our recording solutions (15Blaustein R.O. Finkelstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 96: 905-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Outward conductance is similarly nonlinear, due to a noticeable voltage-dependent inactivation that occurs at membrane potentials +60 mV and higher. From this, we concluded that PA forms ion-conducting pores in CHO-K1 cell membranes at acidic pH and that a contaminating chloride current is also present at pH 5.0. Anthrax toxin action depends on the presence of cellular receptors for PA. Because the formation of heptameric receptor-PA complexes on the cell surface triggers their endocytosis, we treated cells with 2-deoxy-d-glucose, sodium azide, and bafilomycin A prior to incubation with PA. This mixture reduces endocytosis and receptor degradation and boosts the number of receptor-PA complexes at the plasma membrane available for recording in the whole-cell configuration (24Rainey G.J.A. Wigelsworth D.J. Ryan P.L. Scobie H.M. Collier R.J. Young J.A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 26Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7504-7513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This treatment, and the use of recording solutions of pH 5.3, rather than 5.0, greatly reduced the chloride current in subsequent recordings (see Figs. 1, C and D, and 3A for example), perhaps because the chloride current depends on cellular ATP production. To determine whether pore formation depends on receptors in cell membranes, we tested CHO-R1.1 cells, in which both of the known receptors for anthrax toxin are absent (5Bradley K.A. Mogridge J. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Young J.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Fig. 1C shows currents recorded from a CHO-R1.1 cell in the absence of PA. At both pH 7.3 and pH 5.3, the CHO-R1.1 membranes are largely electrically silent at potentials between -100 and 100 mV, and the proton-activated chloride current is largely absent. PA-treated cells (10 nm) gave identical results (Fig. 1D). From this, we concluded that pore formation by PA depends on the presence of cellular receptors for PA. To characterize the basic biophysical properties of PA pores in the plasma membrane, we used HEPES-free recording solutions and a stable CHO-R1.1 cell line that overexpresses CMG2, the higher affinity cellular receptor for anthrax toxin. After incubation with PA and establishment of the whole-cell configuration, cells were subjected to a voltage-step protocol at pH 5.3. Holding the cell membranes at potentials from -100 to 100 mV at 20-mV intervals elicited steady-state currents (Fig. 2A). We plotted mean current amplitudes from three cells as a function of membrane potential (Fig. 2B) and found linear (ohmic) pore conductance over this potential range. We used tetrabutylammonium ions (>1 mm), a known inhibitor of PA pore conductance, to block this mostly linear current, thus distinguishing it from a simple leak in the whole-cell voltage-clamp configuration (not shown, see Fig. 3B for examples). When the duration of each step in the protocol was lengthened to 3 s, we observed current inactivation at potentials greater than +40 and below -60 mV (Fig. 2C). We then plotted current-voltage relationships for initial and steady-state current to show the effects of inactivation (Fig. 2D). In three cells, current amplitude declined by an average of 34% ± 8.6% after 3 s at 100 mV. Inactivation at potentials greater than 75 mV was still apparent, even when the length of the voltage-ramp protocol used in Fig. 1 decreased to 500 ms (not shown). Large positive potentials in the trans chamber of planar lipid bilayer experiments were reported to eliminate conductance through PA pores almost completely (14Blaustein R.O. Koehler T.M. Collier R.J. Finkelstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2209-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). This discrepancy with our measurements could result from differences in the recording solutions, and we therefore tested for inactivation in planar lipid bilayers using the same solutions. Fig. 2, E and F, show currents recorded through PA pores in an artificial bilayer, in response to the same voltage commands used in Fig. 2C and the I-V plots for initial and steady-state currents. Under these conditions, inactivation was much more pronounced at positive (trans) potentials and largely absent at negative potentials. In five membranes, current amplitude declined by an average of 94% ± 2.9% after 3 s at 100 mV. Based on these measurements, the PA formed simple ion-conducting pores in plasma membranes. The pores formed in these membranes only in the presence of cellular receptors and as a result of a conformational change that occurs at acidic pH, converting from membrane-bound prepore to membrane-spanning pore that includes a 14-strand β-barrel (27Petosa C. Collier R.J. Klimpel K.R. Leppla S.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 385: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 28Miller C.J. Elliott J.L. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10432-10441Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Since they are not “gated” like conventional voltage- or ligand-gated channels (once inserted in the membrane, they apparently do not “close”), we could not employ any online leak subtraction strategy. For this reason, in all subsequent recordings, we used solutions containing 10 mm HEPES (internal and external) and 2-s voltage-ramps from -100 to +100 mV. The characteristic S-shaped I-V relation that results from these conditions allowed us to distinguish current flowing through PA pores more easily from the leak current that occasionally contaminates whole-cell recordings. Previous studies indicate that PA pore conductance is inhibited both by LF (29Zhao J. Milne J.C. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18626-18630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 30Zhang S. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16756-16761Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and by the tetraalkylammonium ions (15Blaustein R.O. Finkelstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 96: 905-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we tested the blocking ability of the N-terminal domain of LF (LFN, residues 1-263) and TBA on plasma membrane PA pores. Fig. 3A shows the block (gray) of initial current at pH 5.3 (black) by 30 nm LFN in CMG2-expressing cells. Inhibition was rapid and asymmetric, with pores becoming partially unblocked at positive potentials. Similarly, we characterized the inhibition of PA pores at pH 5.3 by TBA. Fig. 3B shows an example of TBA block at 30 μm. Bath pH was lowered to 5.3, and TBA-containing solution was perfused into the recording chamber until the current amplitude reached steady state (gray). At micromolar concentrations, TBA block was also asymmetric. For this reason, percentage inhibition was always calculated using current amplitudes at -100 mV. Much higher concentrations of TBA (1-10 mm, added directly by pipette) blocked conductance of PA at all potentials. Fig. 3C shows an inhibition curve for TBA under these conditions (squares). Inhibition was almost complete at 300 μm and minimal at 10 μm. The calculated IC50 for TBA from these data is 67 ± 9.5 μm (n = 4 cells). In artificial membranes, the KD for TBA binding to PA pores was reported as 8 μm. Because this discrepancy could arise from differences in recording solutions (chiefly pH and the presence of HEPES), we used our patch clamp solutions to determine the KD of TBA for PA pores in a planar lipid bilayer. Fig. 3C shows the inhibition curve for TBA under these conditions (triangles). The calculated IC50 for TBA from these data is 150 ± 8.9 μm (three membranes). Planar bilayer studies indicate that TBA inhibition of PA pores results from binding to a ring of phenylalanine side chains that protrude into the barrel of the three-dimensional pore structure (13Krantz B.A. Melnyk R.A Zhang S. Juris S.J. Lacy D.B. Wu Z. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. Science. 2005; 309: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). These phenylalanines prove critical to LF translocation through the pore. Mutation of the phenylalanine residue in PA (Phe-427) that serves as the binding site for TBA should abolish the blocking ability of this cation. Fig. 3D shows that this is in fact the case. Substitution of an alanine at this site (F427A) yielded a protein that was similar to wild-type PA in its pH dependence for pore formation and voltage-dependent inactivation at positive potentials, but its conductance at negative potentials was markedly different, remaining linear from 0 to -100 mV (black). As expected, 300 μm TBA had no effect on pores formed by F427A (gray). The absence of voltage-dependent inhibition of the mutant pores by HEPES present in the normal recording solutions (10 mm), combined with the lack of inhibition by TBA, suggested that the voltage-dependent block by these two compounds occurs by a similar mechanism. Biochemical characterization of the PA prepore in complex with either CMG2 or TEM8 receptors suggests that the pH dependence of prepore-to-pore conversion in solution and in cells depends on the specific receptor (24Rainey G.J.A. Wigelsworth D.J. Ryan P.L. Scobie H.M. Collier R.J. Young J.A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We used current as a read-out to measure pore formation directly in cells engineered to express CMG2 or TEM8 receptors in a receptor-null background. We measured inward current amplitude at -100 mV to avoid contaminating chloride currents. CMG2-expressing cells were treated with PA and exposed to a series of increasingly acidic bath solutions following establishment of whole-cell configuration. Pore formation began at pH 5.5, reaching a maximum at pH 5.1. Fig. 4, A and B, show inward currents from one cell and the time course of current development. Pore current was not observed in solutions of pH greater than 5.5, and decreasing the pH below 5.1 did not result in additional current. Fig. 4C shows fractional current amplitude as a function of bath pH. The half-maximal pH for pore insertion into CMG2-expressing cell membranes is 5.3 ± 0.01 (n = 5 cells). Fig. 4, D and E, show inward currents and the time course of pore formation in TEM8-expressing cells. Pore formation occurred at higher pH values and over a narrower pH range, when PA was bound to TEM8. Current was not observed at pH greater than 6.3, and pH values below 6.1 did not result in additional current. The half-maximal pH for pore insertion in TEM8-expressing cells is 6.2 ± 0.02 (Fig. 4F; n = 6 cells). We have used patch clamp electrophysiology to record ionic currents through pores formed by anthrax toxin protective antigen in CHO-K1 and CHO-R1.1 cell plasma membranes. Pore currents showed a linear, mixed cation conductance, with some voltage-dependent inactivation, and inhibition by TBA and LFN. In general, currents recorded in plasma membranes resembled those recorded in artificial planar lipid bilayers but with some key differences. Most importantly, pore formation on cell membranes depended on cellular receptors, whereas pore formation in artificial membranes does not. This was despite the 100-fold higher concentrations of activated PA used in cell experiments. The high affinity binding of PA to its receptors suggested that the receptor might remain a structural component of the heptameric pore through the membrane penetration and possibly the protein translocation processes. The crystal structure of CMG2 bound to the prepore indicates that the receptor serves to prevent the conversion from prepore to pore at neutral pH (18Lacy D.B. Wigelsworth D.J. Melnyk R.A. Harrison S.C. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13147-13151Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 19Santelli E. Bankston L.A. Leppla S.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 2004; 430: 905-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). One result that may illustrate the importance of the receptor to pore structure is the observed difference in voltage-dependent inactivation measured in cells when compared with that measured in artificial bilayers. In plasma membranes, the phenomenon was noticeable, reducing amplitude at 100 mV by less than 40%. In contrast, trans membrane potentials of 60 mV and above essentially shut off conductance through the pore in planar bilayers within 3 s. This could be either due to a voltage-dependent conformational change inside the lumen of the pore or simply due to the pore complex exiting the membrane, in the absence of an anchoring receptor. Although the mechanism for voltage-dependent inactivation is not known, it is unlikely to play an important role in anthrax toxin physiology as potentials of high magnitude are unlikely to occur across endosomal membranes. At the same time, the difference in degree of inactivation, as well as the 2-fold difference in IC50 for TBA in plasma membranes when compared with artificial membranes, suggested at least some difference in pore structure and/or behavior in these two microenvironments. Pore formation depended on cellular receptors and on acidic pH, but the pH range depended on the receptor involved. The biological importance of this receptor effect on prepore-pore conversion may lie in the location along the endosomal-sorting pathway at which LF or EF is delivered to the cytoplasm. Our work confirms the findings of Rainey et al. (24Rainey G.J.A. Wigelsworth D.J. Ryan P.L. Scobie H.M. Collier R.J. Young J.A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), who showed by other means that the pH dependence for pore insertion resides in the receptor. Their work also suggests a reduced affinity between the membrane-spanning pore and its cognate receptors. The extent and kinetics of any dissociation between the pore and its receptors, however, remain to be determined in vivo. In these experiments, the number of receptors present in a given cell seemed to determine the amount of pore current recorded. We recorded less current from “native” CHO-K1 cells than from those overexpressing CMG2 or TEM8. (Over 10-15 cell passages, the amount of current recorded from the stable cell lines gradually declined, to nearly zero, most likely due to gradual loss of stable receptor expression.) Because the interaction between PA and CMG2 is extremely tight, with a reported KD of 170 pm (31Wigelsworth D.J. Krantz B.A. Christensen K.A. Lacy D.B. Juris S.J. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23349-23356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to assume near total receptor occupancy at the working concentration of 10 nm PA. Interestingly, this concentration seemed high enough to saturate the receptors in both the CMG2- and the TEM8-expressing cell lines because the currents measured in the two cell lines were similar in amplitude. This suggests that the effective receptor affinities for PA are similar despite their apparent differences in affinity for monomeric PA (31Wigelsworth D.J. Krantz B.A. Christensen K.A. Lacy D.B.

Collier R.J. Young J.A. Manchester M. J. Infect. Dis. 2005; 192: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). If PA binding and pore formation were simply a function of receptor affinity for monomeric PA, measured currents would presumably have been much smaller in TEM8-expressing cells treated with 10 nm PA. The similarity of effective receptor affinities may reflect predicted high avidity values of the heptameric PA63 prepore when bound to either CMG2 or TEM8. The experiments described here provided a biophysical characterization of receptor-bound PA pores as ion-permeable complexes at the cell surface. The basic protocol for measuring current in these experiments represents a sensitive assay for pore formation in plasma membranes by PA and could probably be adapted for other pore-forming bacterial toxins (33Eriksen S. Olsnes S. Sandvig K. Sand O. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4433-4439Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 34Beise J. Hahnen J. Andersen-Beckh B. Dreyer F. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmakol. 1994; 349: 66-73Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This whole-cell technique may ultimately prove suitable for the study of catalytic factor translocation. However, because the membrane integrity of the recorded cell often deteriorates several minutes after pore insertion, further refinement of these methods will likely be required for translocation measurements, and single-pore measurements may be more appropriate."

The class IB catalytic subunit p110γ forms a heterodimer with a p101 regulatory subunit (5Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J.

In general, p110α is activated upon stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases, and p110γ is activated in response to stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors. p110β is thought to be activated by both G protein-coupled and tyrosine kinase receptors (7Kurosu H.

J., Zuckerman, J. M., Ballou, L. M., Cohen, I. S., and Lin, R. Z. (October 6, 2005) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M506810200. A second line of transgenic mice expressing an inducible GαqQ209L-AA protein showed a similar inhibition of the ICa,L, suggesting a role for PI3K but not PLCβ in this response. 4Fan, G., Jiang, Y.-P., Lu, D., Martin, D. W., Kelly, D. J., Zuckerman, J. M., Ballou, L. M., Cohen, I. S., and Lin, R. Z. (October 6, 2005) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M506810200. In this study, we used whole-cell patch clamping to further investigate the role of PI3K in mediating Gαq inhibition of the ICa,L in myocytes isolated from these transgenic animals. We found that PI(3,4,5)P3 and some PI3K isoforms can reverse the inhibitory effect of Gαq on the cardiac LTCC. Materials—Tamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT) were from Sigma. Recombinant p110β/p85α, p110γ, and PTEN were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). PI(4,5)P2 di-C8, PI(3,5)P2 di-C8, PI(3,4,5)P3 di-C8 and glutathione S-transferase fused to the pleckstrin homology domain of Grp1 (PH-Grp1) were from Echelon Biosciences, Inc. (Salt Lake City, UT). Akt1/2 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Phospho-Erk1/2 antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Recombinant p110α/p85α purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells was described previously (9Ballou L.M. Lin H.Y. Fan G. Jiang Y.P. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23472-23479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). GαqQ209L-hbER Transgenic Mice—C57BL/6 transgenic mice expressing either GαqQ209L-hbER or GαqQ209L-AA-hbER in cardiac myocytes under the control of the α myosin heavy chain promoter were described previously. 4Fan, G., Jiang, Y.-P., Lu, D., Martin, D. W., Kelly, D. J., Zuckerman, J. M., Ballou, L. M., Cohen, I. S., and Lin, R. Z. (October 6, 2005) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M506810200. Starting at 8 weeks of age, GαqQ209L-hbER animals were injected intraperitoneally with 1 mg of tamoxifen daily for 14 days, and GαqQ209L-AA-hbER mice were injected for 28 days. Matching wild-type (WT) littermates that were injected with tamoxifen for an equivalent number of days serve as controls; the WT data shown are pooled from these animals, except where otherwise indicated. All animal-related experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Ventricular Myocyte Isolation—Mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital, and ventricular myocytes were isolated as previously described. 4Fan, G., Jiang, Y.-P., Lu, D., Martin, D. W., Kelly, D. J., Zuckerman, J. M., Ballou, L. M., Cohen, I. S., and Lin, R. Z. (October 6, 2005) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M506810200. Electrophysiology—Only clearly rod-shaped myocytes were studied. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings used 2-3 mΩ borosilicate glass pipettes measured prior to sealing (Sutter Instrument), pCLAMP 8 software, the DigiData 1350 interface, and the Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments). For the recording of ICa,L, pipettes contained internal solution (111 mm CsCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mm glucose, 14 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mm MgATP, pH 7.2, adjusted with CsOH) and cells were perfused in a Na+-free bath solution (137 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4, adjusted with tetraethylammonium hydroxide). Except where otherwise noted, the bath solution also contained 1 μm 4-HT. The membrane capacity was measured in response to a voltage step from the holding potential, and the current amplitude was divided by cell capacitance to give ICa,L density in pA/pF. Membrane capacitance is an indirect measure of cell membrane area. This commonly used approach assumes a specific capacitance of 1 μF/cm2, which could vary slightly depending on physiologic conditions. This variation is expected to be extremely small and well below the detection limit of this technique. Phosphoinositides, PI3K isozymes, PH-Grp1, and PTEN were diluted 100-500-fold in the internal solution and infused through the patch pipette. PTEN buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 81 mm imidazole, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm glutathione, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 267 mm sucrose, and 10% glycerol. Akt Kinase Assays and Western Blots—Frozen mouse organs were homogenized with a PRO250 (Pro Scientific, Inc., Monroe, CT) in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovandate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, pH 7.5). Homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Akt activity was assayed in immunoprecipitates starting with 0.5 mg of tissue lysate protein following a method described earlier (12Ballou L.M. Cross M.E. Huang S. McReynolds E.M. Zhang B.X. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4803-4809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Western blot signals were visualized and quantitated using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System with version 1.2 software (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). IRDye800-conjugated second antibodies were from Rockland Immunochemicals (Gilbertsville, PA). Data Analysis—Values are means ± S.E., and Student's t tests were performed to estimate the significance of the differences between mean values. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Effects of PI(3,4,5)P3 on ICa,L in Cardiac Myocytes—In this study we employed myocytes isolated from two transgenic mouse lines that selectively express silent Gαq proteins in the heart. These proteins, GαqQ209L-hbER and GαqQ209L-AA-hbER, are inactive until they bind to 4-HT. Both of them can inhibit PI3K signaling, but the latter cannot activate PLCβ. Activation of these Gαq proteins in response to injection with tamoxifen, which is converted to 4-HT in animals, causes a large reduction in ICa,L density in cardiac myocytes from both transgenic animals. 4Fan, G., Jiang, Y.-P., Lu, D., Martin, D. W., Kelly, D. J., Zuckerman, J. M., Ballou, L. M., Cohen, I. S., and Lin, R. Z. (October 6, 2005) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M506810200. This result suggests that inhibition of the cardiac LTCC by Gαq occurs independently of PLCβ and may be due to reduced PI3K signaling. This idea is supported by studies showing that PI3Ks stimulate ICa,L in isolated portal vein myocytes (2Macrez N. Mironneau C. Carricaburu V. Quignard J.F. Babich A. Czupalla C. Nurnberg B. Mironneau J. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 3Le Blanc C. Mironneau C. Barbot C. Henaff M. Bondeva T. Wetzker R. Macrez N. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As a first test of this hypothesis, we asked if PI(3,4,5)P3, the lipid product of PI3K, reverses the depressed ICa,L in GαqQ209L-hbER and GαqQ209L-AA-hbER cells. Myocytes were isolated from tamoxifen-treated WT and transgenic mice, and internal solution with or without 1 μm PI(3,4,5)P3 was infused into the cells through the patch pipette. The peak ICa,L density was measured by whole-cell patch clamping at +10 mV following a single depolarizing step of 300 ms duration from a holding potential of -50 mV. PI(3,4,5)P3 did not have a significant effect on ICa,L density in WT myocytes (Fig. 1). However, PI(3,4,5)P3 significantly increased the ICa,L density by 2.4-fold in GαqQ209L-hbER myocytes and 2.2-fold in the GαqQ209L-AA-hbER cells (Fig. 1). The values for PI(3,4,5)P3-treated transgenic myocytes were statistically indistinguishable from those observed in WT myocytes treated with or without PI(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 1). We performed additional control experiments in GαqQ209L-AA-hbER myocytes using other phosphoinositides. Infusion with PI(3,5)P2, which is generated from PI 3-phosphate by a PI 5-kinase, had no effect (Fig. 1). Similarly, PI(4,5)P2, which is converted to PI(3,4,5)P3 by PI3K, did not alter the peak ICa,L density (Fig. 1). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that decreased ICa,L density in the transgenic myocytes is due to Gαq-dependent inhibition of PI3K. We also constructed current density-voltage (I-V) relationships for WT and transgenic myocytes infused with or without PI(3,4,5)P3. Activation of ICa,L was elicited by depolarizing voltage pulses from -50 mV to +50 mV in 10 mV increments (300 ms duration) from a holding potential of -50 mV. Fig. 2A shows typical recordings of ICa,L activation from WT cells in the absence (top panel) or presence (middle panel)of PI(3,4,5)P3. The peak I-V curves for both conditions are plotted in the bottom panel (Fig. 2A). There was no significant difference in ICa,L density between the two conditions at any of the voltages tested. In contrast, infusion with PI(3,4,5)P3 resulted in a large enhancement of ICa,L activation in both the GαqQ209L-hbER (Fig. 2B) and GαqQ209L-AA-hbER (Fig. 2C) myocytes. The I-V relationships (bottom panels of Fig. 2, B and C) show that ICa,L density was increased at nearly all of the voltages tested in both groups of myocytes. To further characterize the action of PI(3,4,5)P3 in transgenic myocytes, we investigated its time-dependent effect on ICa,L activation in single cells. In this protocol, the myocyte was infused with or without PI(3,4,5)P3 and repeatedly depolarized with voltage steps to +10 mV from a holding potential of -50 mV (300 ms duration). The ICa,L densities were normalized to the value obtained from the first voltage step following opening of the patch and initiation of whole-cell recording. As shown in the left panel of Fig. 3, the typical “run-down” of ICa,L density was observed in GαqQ209L-hbER myocytes when the patch pipette contained the control internal solution without PI(3,4,5)P3. Within 180 s, the normalized ICa,L density in these cells decreased by about 20%. In contrast, in the presence of PI(3,4,5)P3 we observed a “run-up” of ICa,L density in both the GαqQ209L-hbER (Fig. 3, middle panel) and GαqQ209L-AA-hbER (Fig. 3, right panel) myocytes. ICa,L density started to decrease after reaching a maximum after ∼120 s and the rate of decline was similar to that seen in cells infused with the control solution. Interestingly, even the first voltage step elicited a significantly larger ICa,L in cells infused with PI(3,4,5)P3 as compared with the control internal solution. Modulation of ICa,L by PI3K Isozymes in GαqQ209L-AA-hbER Myocytes—We next asked if infusion of purified PI3K proteins into GαqQ209L-AA-hbER myocytes has the same effect as PI(3,4,5)P3 in increasing ICa,L density. Multiple isoforms of PI3K have been identified in the adult heart of different species (6Oudit G.Y. Sun H. Kerfant B.G. Crackower M.A. Penninger J.M. Backx P.H. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2004; 37: 449-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), and we tested three of them: p110α/p85α, p110β/p85α, and p110γ. The effects of these PI3K isozymes on the peak ICa,L density at +10 mV are shown in Fig. 4. In the absence of PI(4,5)P2, none of the three PI3K isozymes had an effect on ICa,L density. However, in the presence of PI(4,5)P2, both p110β/p85α and p110γ induced a significant increase in ICa,L density (2.6- and 2.2-fold, respectively). These increased ICa,L density values were similar to those observed in WT myocytes (see Fig. 1). Interestingly, infusion with p110α/p85α plus PI(4,5)P2 had no effect on ICa,L density (Fig. 4). These results suggest that ICa,L in the Gαq transgenic myocytes is modulated by specific PI3K isoforms. Fig. 5 shows typical traces of ICa,L activation in the presence of PI3K isozymes without (A) or with (B) PI(4,5)P2 that were used to construct I-V relationships (Fig. 5, C and D). The I-V curves show that infusion of the PI3K isozymes alone did not change ICa,L density across the entire voltage range examined as compared with the control cells infused with internal solution only (Fig. 5C). In the presence of PI(4,5)P2, both p110β/p85α and p110γ stimulated ICa,L at nearly all the voltages tested (Fig. 5D). The I-V curve for myocytes infused with p110α/p85α plus PI(4,5)P2 is nearly identical to the curve obtained from cells infused with PI(4,5)P2 alone (Fig. 5D). We also examined the time-dependent effect of PI3K isozymes plus PI(4,5)P2 on ICa,L in GαqQ209L-AA-hbER myocytes subjected to repeated depolarizing voltage steps. Infusion of p110α/p85α plus PI(4,5)P2 did not prevent the typical run-down (Fig. 6, left panel). In contrast, a run-up of ICa,L followed by a slow decrease was observed when either p110β/p85α or p110γ plus PI(4,5)P2 were infused into the cells (Fig. 6, middle and right panels). Reduction of ICa,L by Decreasing Endogenous PI(3,4,5)P3 in WT Myocytes—Since the reduction of ICa,L density in Gαq transgenic myocytes can be reversed by infusing exogenous PI(3,4,5)P3 or some PI3Ks, we hypothesized that depletion of endogenous PI(3,4,5)P3 in WT myocytes would lower ICa,L density. Two approaches were used to test this hypothesis. In the first approach, we infused myocytes isolated from WT mice (not treated with tamoxifen) with purified PH-Grp1 protein to sequester intracellular PI(3,4,5)P3. PH-Grp1 has been shown to bind specifically to PI(3,4,5)P3 (13Gray A. Van Der Kaay J. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and has been used to block PI3K signaling (4Viard P. Butcher A.J. Halet G. Davies A. Nurnberg B. Heblich F. Dolphin A.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In the presence of 20 nm PH-Grp1, the peak ICa,L density measured after a 300 ms pulse at +10 mV from a holding potential of -50 mV was 6.6 ± 0.6 pA/pF (n = 7) as compared with 9.6 ± 0.4 pA/pF (n = 7) for cells infused with the control solution. This 31% decrease is statistically significant (t test, p < 0.01). Shown in Fig. 7A (top two panels) are representative current traces that were used to construct the I-V relationships. The I-V curves show that PH-Grp1 reduced ICa,L density at nearly all of the voltages tested (Fig. 7A, bottom panel). In the second approach, we infused myocytes from untreated WT mice with the lipid phosphatase PTEN, which specifically dephosphorylates the D3 position on the inositol ring of PI(3,4,5)P3 to form PI(4,5)P2. When 20 nm purified PTEN protein was infused through the patch pipette, the peak ICa,L density at +10 mV measured after a 300 ms pulse from a holding potential of -50 mV was reduced by 28% to 6.5 ± 0.4 pA/pF (n = 20) versus 9.0 ± 0.6 pA/pF (n = 5) for control cells infused with an equivalent volume of PTEN buffer diluted into internal solution. The difference between the two conditions is statistically significant (t test, p < 0.01). The top two panels in Fig. 7B show sample current traces that were used to construct the I-V relationships for these two conditions (Fig. 7B, bottom panel). The ICa,L densities were reduced at nearly all of the voltages tested when PTEN was infused into the cells as compared with the control solution. Taken together, these results demonstrate that reduction of endogenous PI(3,4,5)P3 levels negatively modulates ICa,L activation in mouse cardiac myocytes. Reduced PI3K/Akt Signaling in GαqQ209L-AA-hbER Hearts—We previously demonstrated using an Akt activity assay that activation of GαqQ209L-AA-hbER in human embryonic kidney 293 cells inhibits PI3K signaling. 4Fan, G., Jiang, Y.-P., Lu, D., Martin, D. W., Kelly, D. J., Zuckerman, J. M., Ballou, L. M., Cohen, I. S., and Lin, R. Z. (October 6, 2005) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M506810200. The protein kinase Akt is a downstream effector of PI3K that is activated by PI(3,4,5)P3. Here, we used Akt assays to confirm that PI3K signaling is reduced in hearts of GαqQ209L-AA-hbER mice as compared with WT mice. Both groups of animals were injected with tamoxifen for 28 days. Since food intake can affect PI3K signaling in some tissues due to changes in circulating insulin levels, the animals were fasted overnight and then injected with either insulin or saline as a control. Even though cardiac Akt activities were very low in mice injected with saline, we detected a consistent decrease in basal Akt activity in the GαqQ209L-AA-hbER hearts as compared with WT (Fig. 8A). GαqQ209L-AA-hbER inhibition of PI3K signaling was more obvious in animals treated with insulin. Insulin treatment induced large increases in Akt activity in both WT and GαqQ209L-AA-hbER hearts. However, total Akt activity was 33% less in the GαqQ209L-AA-hbER hearts as compared with WT (Fig. 8A). The difference in Akt activity is statistically significant (t test, p < 0.01). In contrast, GαqQ209L-AA-hbER did not reduce insulin-induced phosphorylation of Erk1/2 as measured by Western blotting using a phospho-specific antibody (Fig. 8B, bottom panel). Insulin stimulates a modest increase in Erk1/2 phosphorylation in the heart (data not shown). Expression of Akt protein was not reduced in GαqQ209L-AA-hbER hearts, as demonstrated by Western blotting of tissue lysates (Fig. 8B, top panel). These results indicate that activation of GαqQ209L-AA-hbER results in reduced PI3K/Akt signaling in the heart. Our initial study showing that ICa,L in GαqQ209L-hbER and GαqQ209L-AA-hbER transgenic myocytes is similarly depressed as compared with WT myocytes 4Fan, G., Jiang, Y.-P., Lu, D., Martin, D. W., Kelly, D. J., Zuckerman, J. M., Ballou, L. M., Cohen, I. S., and Lin, R. Z. (October 6, 2005) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M506810200. suggested that PLCβ was not involved in this response. The ability of both of these fusion proteins to inhibit PI3K signaling led us to examine this pathway as a possible mediator of Gαq inhibition of the LTCC. In this study, we demonstrate that infusion of exogenous PI(3,4,5)P3 into GαqQ209L-hbER and GαqQ209L-AA-hbER myocytes completely reverses the inhibition of ICa,L. ICa,L is also fully restored in GαqQ209L-AA-hbER myocytes infused with certain PI3K isozymes in the presence of their phospholipid substrate. Together, these results support the idea that Gαq inhibits certain PI3Ks to cause a reduction in ICa,L. Furthermore, since reduction of endogenous PI(3,4,5)P3 levels in WT myocytes depresses ICa,L density, it appears that constitutive PI3K signaling is required for normal LTCC function. It is well established that activation of Gαs and subsequent activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase stimulates cardiac LTCC function. On the other hand, activation of pertussis toxin-insensitive Gα proteins such as Gαq/11 inhibits neuronal L-type (14Shapiro M.S. Loose M.D. Hamilton S.E. Nathanson N.M. Gomeza J. Wess J. Hille B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10899-10904Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and N- and P/Q-type (15Dolphin A.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 607-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) Ca2+ channels. Gβγ subunits released from pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins also inhibit N- and P/Q-type channels through direct protein-protein interactions, but they do not bind to or inhibit the LTCC (15Dolphin A.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 607-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). It is not known how activation of Gαq leads to inhibition of neuronal Ca2+ channels, but our results here using myocytes suggest that it could be due to inhibition of PI3K. Interestingly, a recent study indicates that inhibition of the neuronal LTCC by the M1 muscarinic receptor is mediated by Gαq/11 but does not appear to involve PLCβ (16Bannister R.A. Melliti K. Adams B.A. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3256-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our studies consistently support the concept that Gαq can inhibit PI3K independently of PLCβ activation. We initially showed that Gαq/ 11-coupled α1A adrenergic receptors inhibit growth factor and insulin activation of PI3K (12Ballou L.M. Cross M.E. Huang S. McReynolds E.M. Zhang B.X. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4803-4809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Ballou L.M. Tian P.Y. Lin H.Y. Jiang Y.P. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40910-40916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we demonstrated that activated Gαq directly binds to and inhibits the p110α/p85α PI3K 4Fan, G., Jiang, Y.-P., Lu, D., Martin, D. W., Kelly, D. J., Zuckerman, J. M., Ballou, L. M., Cohen, I. S., and Lin, R. Z. (October 6, 2005) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M506810200. (9Ballou L.M. Lin H.Y. Fan G. Jiang Y.P. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23472-23479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). By contrast, transfected GαqQ209L did not inhibit p110β immunoprecipitated from cotransfected cells (9Ballou L.M. Lin H.Y. Fan G. Jiang Y.P. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23472-23479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We have also reported that activated Gαq does not bind to p110γ, 4Fan, G., Jiang, Y.-P., Lu, D., Martin, D. W., Kelly, D. J., Zuckerman, J. M., Ballou, L. M., Cohen, I. S., and Lin, R. Z. (October 6, 2005) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M506810200. and studies are ongoing in our laboratory to determine whether GTP-bound Gαq interacts with other isoforms of PI3K. Results in this study show that p110β/p85α or p110γ, but not p110α/p85α, reversed Gαq inhibition of ICa,L (Figs. 4 and 5). One explanation for this result is that activated Gαq inhibits only p110α, and the transgenic myocytes express enough activated Gαq proteins to neutralize the infused p110α/p85α. Activation of PI3K potentiates ICa,L in rat portal vein myocytes and rat cerebellar granule neurons (1Blair L.A. Marshall J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 421-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 2Macrez N. Mironneau C. Carricaburu V. Quignard J.F. Babich A. Czupalla C. Nurnberg B. Mironneau J. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that exogenous PI(3,4,5)P3 had no effect on ICa,L activation in WT mouse cardiac myocytes (Figs. 1 and 2). We have also found that infusion of canine cardiac myocytes with PI(3,4,5)P3 does not potentiate ICa,L activation (data not shown). One possible explanation for these differences between cell types could be that cardiac forms of the LTCC are highly sensitive to the level PI(3,4,5)P3 and are maximally active at the level found in these cells. Alternatively, PI3K signaling might be maximally activated in cardiac myocytes, so addition of exogenous lipid second messenger would not have an effect. This possibility seems remote because basal Akt activity in the mouse heart is very low but can be strongly increased by insulin treatment (Fig. 8). We have also measured PI3K activity in p110α, p110β, or p110γ immunoprecipitates from freshly prepared heart lysates and found the activities to be very low (data not shown). We believe that LTCC function or localization at the plasma membrane is near maximal in cardiac myocytes, despite the low PI3K activity. Therefore, increasing PI3K signaling does not further stimulate ICa,L, but inhibition of this signaling pathway by activated Gαq, PH-Grp1, or PTEN can lead to a reduction in ICa,L. Activation of Gq-coupled receptors might have complex effects on the modulation of the LTCC. G protein-coupled receptors can activate more than one type of Gα subunit, and these could modulate LTCC function in diverse ways. Furthermore, some of the released βγ subunits could activate p110γ or p110β. In addition, p110α can complex with different p85 isoforms, and these heterodimers may be differentially affected by Gαq. Interestingly, Macrez and co-workers (18Quignard J.F. Mironneau J. Carricaburu V. Fournier B. Babich A. Nurnberg B. Mironneau C. Macrez N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32545-32551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) found that angiotensin II stimulation of the portal vein myocyte LTCC is mediated by Gβγ activation of p110γ. The Gβγ dimer in question appears to be released from Gα13 rather than Gαq (19Macrez N. Morel J.L. Kalkbrenner F. Viard P. Schultz G. Mironneau J. J. Biol.

Gβγ dimers containing β5 are least able to activate p110γ and p110β, while those containing γ11 are least able to activate p110γ (8Kerchner K.R. Clay R.L. McCleery G. Watson N. McIntire W.E.

We predict that stimulation of a Gq-coupled receptor will negatively modulate the LTCC if (a) the activated Gαq inhibits p110α and (b) its released Gβγ dimer is a weak activator of p110β and p110γ. More studies are needed to determine how cells integrate these competing signals to mount an appropriate Ca2+ channel response. LTCCs are composed of α1, β, and δ/α2 subunits and, in some forms, an additional γ subunit. There are also multiple isoforms of each subunit. The α1 subunit forms the pore of the channel and the intracellular β subunit regulates cellular localization. Cardiac LTCCs are mostly composed of α1C and β2a isoforms, although other β variants are also present in the heart (21Striessnig J. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 1999; 9: 242-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In a heterologous expression system, PI3K signaling stimulated ICa,L through Akt-mediated phosphorylation of β2a subunits, leading to increased trafficking of the LTCC to the plasma membrane (4Viard P. Butcher A.J. Halet G. Davies A. Nurnberg B. Heblich F. Dolphin A.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Akt specifically phosphorylates the β2a subunit on a consensus sequence that is not present in β1b, β3, or β4 (4Viard P. Butcher A.J. Halet G. Davies A. Nurnberg B. Heblich F. Dolphin A.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Akt by Gαq may reduce trafficking of the cardiac LTCC to the plasma membrane. Additional studies are planned to determine whether infusion of purified activated Akt proteins reverses the inhibition of ICa,L in our transgenic myocytes and if these cells show a decreased amount of LTCC proteins in the plasma membrane. Finally, it would be of interest to explore whether G protein-coupled receptors, Gαq, and p110α PI3K form a macromolecular signaling complex with the LTCC at the myocyte plasma membrane so that the current through these channels can be specifically regulated. In conclusion, results from this study indicate that negative modulation of the LTCC by activated Gαq in cardiac myocytes is mediated by inhibition of PI3K, perhaps specifically by the p110α isoform. Further studies are needed to determine whether L-type and other types of Ca2+ channels present in other excitable cell types are also inhibited by Gαq through a similar mechanism."

Instead, the helical protrusion at the tip of the apical domain forms a built-in lid of the central cavity. Although many studies on the lid's conformation have been carried out, the conformation in each step of the ATPase cycle remains obscure. To clarify this issue, we examined the effects of ADP-aluminum fluoride (AlFx) and ADP-beryllium fluoride (BeFx) complexes on α-chaperonin from the hyperthermophilic archaeum, Thermococcus sp. strain KS-1. Biochemical assays, electron microscopic observations, and small angle x-ray scattering measurements demonstrate that α-chaperonin incubated with ADP and BeFx exists in an asymmetric conformation; one ring is open, and the other is closed. The result indicates that α-chaperonin also shares the inherent functional asymmetry of bacterial and eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonins. Most interestingly, addition of ADP and BeFx induced α-chaperonin to encapsulate unfolded proteins in the closed ring but did not trigger their folding. Moreover, α-chaperonin incubated with ATP and AlFx or BeFx adopted a symmetric closed conformation, and its functional turnover was inhibited.

Chaperonins, one of the most well studied molecular chaperones, are ubiquitous and indispensable proteins that are involved in protein folding in the cell. They assist in protein folding reactions both in vivo and in vitro by binding unfolded proteins within the central cavity of the double ring structure (1Bukau B. Horwich A.L.

The most extensively characterized member is the Escherichia coli chaperonin GroEL and its partner GroES. GroEL-mediated protein folding requires GroES as a lid of the GroEL cavity. GroEL is functionally asymmetrical and is referred to as a “two-stroke engine,” with one ring binding ATP and GroES, and simultaneously acting as the place where protein folding occurs, followed by an identical reaction on the opposite ring (6Lorimer G.

In contrast, group II chaperonins, found in Archaea (called thermosome) and the eukaryotic cytosol (known as CCT or TCP-1 ring complex), work without the cofactor corresponding to GroES. The helical protrusion at the tip of the apical domain substitutes for the cofactor as a built-in lid of the central cavity. Many studies on the change of the lid's conformation coupled to the binding and hydrolysis of nucleotides have been carried out. It was found that ATP drives the conformational change of group II chaperonins from the open lid, substrate binding conformation to the closed lid conformation to encapsulate unfolded protein in the central cavity (9Ditzel L.

Generation of Chaperonin-ADP-Metal Fluoride Complexes—α-Chaperonin-ADP-metal fluoride complexes were prepared by the incubation of 1 mm ATP/ADP, 30 mm NaF, and 5 mm Al(NO3)3/BeSO4 for 60 min at 60 °C in HKM buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2), with exceptions specially described. The presence of sulfate ion (5 mm) did not affect the conformation of the chaperonins (data not shown). Quantitation of Bound Nucleotide—αWT (1 μm) was incubated with nucleotides (1 mm) in the absence and presence of metal fluoride for 60 min at 60 °C, and the mixtures were applied to a NAP-5 column equilibrated with HKM buffer to remove unbound nucleotides. Isolated αWT-nucleotide complexes were treated with ice-cold perchloric acid at a final concentration of 2.5% and then were centrifuged. Aliquots of the supernatant were analyzed by a reverse-phase column (TSKgel ODS-80Ts, Tosoh, Japan) with 30 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 2% (v/v) methanol at the flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using an Alliance HPLC System (Waters, Milford, MA). The eluate was monitored with an on-line UV spectrophotometer (Waters 996 photodiode array detector) at 259 nm, and the amount of nucleotide was calculated using peak area. Protease Sensitivity Assay—αWT (100 nm) was incubated with or without nucleotide (1 mm) and metal fluorides at 60 °C in HKM buffer under continuous mixing. Digestion with proteinase K (0.25 ng/μl) was carried out for 5 min at 60 °C. Proteins in the reaction mixture were precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid and then analyzed on 15% SDS gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Band intensities were quantitated using Scion Image software (Scion Corp., Fredrick, MD). Fluorescence Measurements—The tryptophan fluorescence spectra of αL265W (14Iizuka R. Yoshida T. Shomura Y.

The excitation wavelength was set at 295 nm, and the emission was recorded from 310 to 450 nm (band-width = 3 nm for excitation and 5 nm for emission). αL265W (0.2 μm) was preincubated with or without nucleotide (1 mm) and metal fluorides at 60 °C, and the mixture was stirred throughout the measurement. Fluorescence intensity (I) was calculated from Icorrected = Isample - Iblank where the blank contained all other components of the assay mixture except αL265W. All spectra obtained were the average of five scans. Electron Microscopy and Image Processing—αWT (100 nm) was incubated with nucleotides (1 mm) and BeFx at 60 °C, and the aliquots were negatively stained in 1% uranyl acetate for 30 s on thin carbon support film, which was hydrophilized by a hydrophilic treatment device (JEOL Datum HDT-400). The specimen grids were scanned at low magnification under dark illumination to reduce radiation damage. After adjusting the astigmatism and focus at adjacent areas, images of target area were recorded by making use of a slow scan CCD camera (Gatan Retractable Multiscan Camera) under low electron dose conditions at a magnification of ×50,000 in a Philips Tecnai F20 electron microscope operated at 120 kV. The images were processed with a digital micrograph (Gatan Inc.) followed by the SPIDER image processing system (Health Research Inc., New York) for single particle analysis (30Frank J. Shimkin B. Dowse H. Ultramicroscopy. 1981; 6: 343-358Crossref Google Scholar). For each data set with the desired experimental condition, appropriate images of monodispersed particles were selected and rotated to maximize correlation. Normalized cross-correlation function between any two pictures was calculated successively by using Fourier transform relationship. Finally, the pictures derived from the monodispersed particles were averaged after rejecting the particles that correlated poorly by using SPIDER/WEB system on an SGI UNIX cluster (31Frank J.

SAXS Measurements—The SAXS experiments were performed with beamline 15A at the Photon Factory of the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, Tsukuba, Japan. The measurements were made with protein concentrations of 7 mg/ml in HKM buffer at 60 °C. Before data collection, the protein solutions were incubated with or without nucleotides (1 mm) and BeFx at 60 °C. Scattering patterns were recorded by a CCD-based x-ray detector, which consisted of a beryllium-windowed x-ray image intensifier (Be-XRII) (Hamamatsu, V5445P-MOD), an optical lens, a CCD image sensor, and a data acquisition system (Hamamatsu C7300), as described (32Arai M.

Pair distribution (P(r)) functions were calculated by using the GNOM program (34Semenyuk A.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallog. 1991; 24: 537-540Crossref Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The Q range used for the calculation was from 0.0156 to 0.170 Å-1. The values of radius of gyration (Rg) and maximum particle distance (Dmax) were derived from the P(r) function. Thermal Aggregation Measurements—The thermal aggregation of CS was monitored by measuring light scattering at 500 nm with a spectrofluorometer (FP-6500) for 30 min at 50 °C. Native CS was diluted to a final concentration of 100 nm (as a monomer) in HKM buffer with or without αWT (50 nm). The reaction mixtures were preincubated for 10 min at 50 °C and continuously stirred throughout the measurement. GFP Refolding Assays—GFP (5 μm) was denatured in the folding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 100 mm HCl at room temperature, and diluted 100-fold in the folding buffer with or without αWT (100 nm). αWT was complexed with ADP and BeFx by incubation with 1 mm ADP, 30 mm NaF, and 5 mm BeSO4 for 60 min at 60 °C in the folding buffer. Nucleotides were added to a final concentration of 1 mm in the mixture 5 min after the dilution of denatured GFP. The fluorescence of GFP at 510 nm with excitation at 396 nm was continuously monitored for 30 min with a Jasco FP-6500 spectrofluorometer. The reaction mixtures were continuously stirred at 60 °C throughout the assays. As a control, native GFP was diluted in the folding buffer without αWT. The fluorescence intensity of native GFP was taken as 100%. Preparation of Cy5-CS and the Amount of Cy5-CS in the Chaperonin Cavity—Before labeling, CS was desalted on a NAP-5 column equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. After mixing of 200 μl of CS (22.4 μm, as a monomer) with 20 μl of 1 m Na2HPO4, Cy5 monoreactive dye (Amersham Biosciences) was added to 83 μm, and the mixture was incubated for 3 h at room temperature. The unreacted Cy5 was then removed with a NAP-5 column. The extent of the labeling was determined by absorption spectroscopy. The molar ratio of Cy5 to CS monomer was 1.4. The fluorescent-labeled CS is designated Cy5-CS. Cy5-CS (100 nm, as a monomeric concentration) was diluted in HKM buffer containing 50 nm αWT, 30 mm NaF, and 5 mm BeSO4. Nucleotides (1 mm) were added to the mixture 5 min after the dilution. After incubation for 60 min at 60 °C, proteinase K (0.25 ng/μl) was added. After a 30-min digestion at 60 °C, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride was added at a final concentration of 2 mm, and the aggregated Cy5-CS was removed by centrifugation (17,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was precipitated using trichloroacetic acid and then applied to a 10% SDS gel. The gel was visualized using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and an image analyzer, Typhoon 8600 (Amersham Biosciences), with excitation at 633 nm and a 670 BP 30 (Cy5) emission filter. Preparation of Chaperonin-ADP-Metal Fluoride Complexes—We employed aluminum fluoride and beryllium fluoride (termed AlFx and BeFx) to elucidate details of the group II chaperonin reaction cycle. AlFx and BeFx act as structural analogs of inorganic phosphate and have been used to study a variety of NTPases (e.g. Refs. 19Bigay J. Deterre P. Pfister C. Chabre M.

They are bound to the nucleotide-binding pockets with ADP, and the complexes are interpreted as mimicking the ground state (BeFx) and the transition state (AlFx) of NTP hydrolysis and block further nucleotide exchange (19Bigay J. Deterre P. Pfister C. Chabre M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2907-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 20Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). In this study, T. KS-1 α-chaperonin-ADP-metal fluoride complexes were prepared in the following two ways: (i) mixing α-chaperonin with ADP and metal fluoride (referred to as ADP + AlFx and ADP + BeFx), and (ii) substituting metal fluoride for inorganic phosphate generated by ATP hydrolysis of α-chaperonin (referred to as ATP + AlFx and ATP + BeFx). At the beginning of this study, the amounts of nucleotides bound to wild-type α-chaperonin (αWT) were examined (TABLE ONE). Total nucleotide-binding sites of T. KS-1 α-chaperonin complex are estimated to be 16 (8 binding sites per ring). Neither ATP nor ADP was found in the purified proteins (data not shown). αWT in the absence of metal fluoride did not bind nucleotides tightly, and small amounts of bound nucleotides were detected (TABLE ONE, rows 1 and 2). On the other hand, αWT in the presence of metal fluorides formed relatively stable complexes with ADP and contained 5-6 mol of ADP per mol (TABLE ONE, rows 3-6). AlFx and BeFx should take the place of the γ-phosphate of ATP and stabilize the association of αWT with ADP. In the presence of ATP, both ATP and ADP were bound to αWT (TABLE ONE, rows 1, 3, and 5), suggesting that one ring may be saturated with metal fluoride and ADP generated by the hydrolysis of ATP, and ATP remains in the other ring. Although there are 16 nucleotide-binding sites in αWT, only about 8 nucleotides were observed in the present study. This is probably because of the relatively low affinity of nucleotides to αWT as shown in the results of the experiments without metal fluorides. Several nucleotides should be lost during gel filtration by the NAP-5 column. It is also reported that GroEL is unable to bind nucleotides tightly in the absence of GroES (35Bochkareva E.S.

Subsequently, structural and functional analyses were performed. Conformation of the Lids of Chaperonin-ADP-Metal Fluoride Complexes—Initially, protease sensitivity assays of αWT with or without nucleotides and metal fluorides were conducted using proteinase K (Fig. 1). Previously, we revealed that the pattern of digestion of αWT by proteases differs according to the lid's conformation; the open lid conformation (nucleotide-free or ADP-bound form) is susceptible to proteases, and the closed lid conformation (ATP-bound form) is resistant (14Iizuka R.

In the presence of ATP, αWT was relatively proteinase K-resistant and polypeptides of about 60 kDa, corresponding to the undigested αWT, remained (Fig. 1, lane 2). In contrast, the 60-kDa polypeptides almost completely disappeared in the absence of nucleotide or the presence of ADP (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 3). αWT incubated with ADP + AlFx did not show protease resistance (Fig. 1A, lane 5). The result was the same irrespective of the aluminum salt species (AlCl3 and AlK(SO4)2) (data not shown). On the other hand, incubation with ADP + BeFx caused a half-level of protection (Fig. 1B, lane 5). It has been demonstrated previously that CCT is more resistant to proteinase K at the helical protrusion in the presence of ADP + AlFx than in the presence of ADP + BeFx or the absence of nucleotide (13Meyer A.S. Gillespie J.R. Walther D. Millet I.S. Doniach S. Frydman J. Cell. 2003; 113: 369-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Our results were the opposite of those obtained previously with CCT. Besides, the incubation with ATP + AlFx or BeFx provided a substantial level of protection (Fig. 1, lane 6). Additionally, we examined the lid's conformations by analyzing the fluorescence spectra of the tryptophan at the tip of the helical protrusion of a mutant, αL265W (14Iizuka R. Yoshida T. Shomura Y. Miki K. Maruyama T. Odaka M. Yohda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44959-44965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Addition of ATP to αL265W caused a large increase (about 60%) in tryptophan fluorescence intensity, with a detectable blue shift in the wavelength of the emission maximum (Fig. 2A, red line, and TABLE TWO). On the other hand, a slight decrease in fluorescence was observed on the addition of ADP (Fig. 2A, blue line, and TABLE TWO). An increase in fluorescence was induced by incubation with ADP + BeFx (about 41%) with a slight blue shift in the emission maximum, whereas a tiny increase (about 7.6%) was observed on incubation with ADP + AlFx (Fig. 2, B and C, blue line, and TABLE TWO). Also, αL265W incubated with ATP + metal fluorides indicated both a blue shift and a marked enhancement of fluorescence emission (AlFx, about 89%; BeFx, about 80%) (Fig. 2, B and C, red line, and TABLE TWO). This series of results is in good agreement with the results of protease sensitivity assays (Fig. 1).TABLE TWOFluorescence parameters of αL265WMaximum of Trp flu"

It bears no obvious homology to any known protein or motif, and its expression pattern is very similar to that of tau in human tissues. The DNA sequences homologous to the human STH gene reveal an intact, highly conserved open reading frame in the primates most closely related to humans (chimpanzee, bonobo, and gorilla) but not in other primates or in rodents (2Conrad C.

This polymorphism is associated with the two tau gene haplotypes: the Q allele with H1, the R allele with H2 (2Conrad C. Vianna C. Schultz C. Thal D.R. Ghebremedhin E. Lenz J. Braak H. Davies P. J.

The Q allele is the most common haplotype in humans, but all nonhuman primates are homozygous for the R allele, which makes the Q allele a human-specific marker (2Conrad C. Vianna C. Schultz C.

Hence, the R allele is the ancestral haplotype, whereas the Q allele evolved after the human lineages separated from the other primates. In addition to evolution studies, the R allele of STH was initially found to be associated with Alzheimer disease (1Conrad C. Vianna C. Freeman M. Davies P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Taken together, these results suggest that identifying a function of STH could implicate several proteins and/or pathway(s) as potential contributors in these neurodegenerative diseases as well. To discover putative functions of STH, we used it as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screening. We discovered that it interacts with a unique member of the peroxiredoxin family, peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6), which has both an antioxidant function and phospholipase activity (15Fisher A.B. Dodia C.

In addition to its role in normal cells, Prdx6 is elevated in Pick disease (17Krapfenbauer K. Engidawork E. Cairns N. Fountoulakis M. Lubec G. Brain Res. 2003; 967: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), a disorder related to progressive supranuclear palsy and frontotemporal dementia, illustrating another potential connection to STH. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and Assays—We constructed the bait vector (pLexA/HK) from the LexA fragment of vector pHybLex/Zeo and the kanamycin region of vector pHybcI/HK using AlwNI and NotI (Invitrogen). The STH cDNA was cut with BamHI plus Klenow from pEGFP-STH and cloned 3′ to LexA in the bait vector cut with Bsp120I plus Klenow to generate bait pLexA-STH. The pLexA-STH bait was transformed into yeast strain EGY48 bearing a reporter plasmid (pSH18–34) followed by transformation of a human fetal brain library cloned in vector pJG4–5 (Clontech). We selected interactors on SD (minimal synthetic medium) yeast plates lacking histidine (bait), tryptophan (library), uracil (reporter), and leucine (interaction marker) and verified them independently by the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) test. We rescued the plasmids of interactors by PCR with primers JG-S and YUN (shown in TABLE ONE) and classified them by digestion of the PCR products with AluI and HinfI. Unique plasmids were cloned into vector pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced in an Applied Biosystems fluorescent sequencer. The DNA sequences were analyzed using the BLAST program.TABLE ONEPrimers used in PCRNameStrandLocationLengthSequenceYeast expression vector, PCR and sequencing JG-SSIn JG4–5 vector24GTTAACGATACCAGCCTCTTGCTG YUNAIn JG4–5 vector20GGCATGCCGGTAGAGGTGTGEndogenous and mammalian expression vector, RT-PCR SPL-LSSIn SPL3 vector27TCTGAGTCACCTGGACAACCTCAAAGG SPL-LNAIn SPL3 vector27ATCTCAGTGGTATTTGTGAGCCAGGGC Prdx6-PSSStarts on Prdx6 ATG24ATGCCCGGAGGTCTGCTTCTCGGG Prdx6-DNAEnds on Prdx6 TAA24TTAAGGCTGGGGTGTGTAGCGGAGPoint mutation constructsaFor creating point mutations, we used pairs of these primers and their reverse complements (not shown).

The STH gene was cloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) and into pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences) by BamHI digests. Western blots using as primaries monoclonal antibodies against FLAG (Sigma, mouse) and GFP (Molecular Probes, rabbit) show that all constructs express proteins of the correct size at equivalent amounts (see Fig. 2, A and B). We transformed the GST-STH fusion plasmids into BL21(DE3)/RIPL cells (Stratagene) and produced recombinant protein according to the Novagen instructions. Coomassie Blue staining shows that the fusion protein is expressed and stable (see Fig. 3A). Site-directed Mutagenesis—We created both the 7Q and the 7R STH alleles and two mutants of Prdx6 that affect its functions (S32A and C47S (16Chen J.W. Dodia C. Feinstein S.I. Jain M.K. Fisher A.B. J.

Gao Q.S. Wang Y. Lafyatis R. Stamm S. Andreadis A. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1078-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The mutagenic primers are shown in TABLE ONE. Cell Culture, Transfections, and RNA Preparation—COS (monkey kidney) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum. SKN (human neuroblastoma) cells were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, and 1× minimal essential amino acids. Plasmid DNA was prepared by Qiagen Tip-50s and introduced into cells by lipofection (LT1, Panvera). SP/10L has been described previously (18Wang J. Gao Q.S. Wang Y. Lafyatis R. Stamm S. Andreadis A. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1078-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We used 3 μg of each plasmid for transfections. Total RNA was isolated by the TRIzol method (Invitrogen). Reverse Transcription and PCR Reactions—For analysis of tau construct RNA, we performed reverse transcription and reverse transcription-PCR as described previously (18Wang J. Gao Q.S. Wang Y. Lafyatis R. Stamm S. Andreadis A. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1078-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) using the primer pair SPL-LS/SPL-LN (TABLE ONE). The isoform ratio was calculated by scanning the bands from three independent transfections using the One-Dscan program and the Scanalytics IPLab software. For analysis of endogenous Prdx6 levels, we used the Ambion quantitative method. 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA (Clontech) from fetal brain, adult cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, spinal cord, skeletal muscle, and heart was reverse-transcribed with RNase H- Superscript II (Invitrogen) in 20 μl for 1 h at 42 °C.1 μl of this mix was then added to one Ready-to-Go PCR bead (Amersham Biosciences) in a volume of 25 μl, and the mixture was amplified for 25 cycles. The PCR conditions were: denaturation 94 °C/1 min, annealing 60 °C/1 min, extension 72 °C/1 min. The primer pair was Prdx6-PS/Prdx6-DN, and a ratio of 3:7 18 S primers to 18 S competimers (Ambion) was used as an internal control. Co-immunoprecipitations—EGFP-STH and FLAG-Prdx6 were co-transfected in COS and SKN cells. After 48 h, we prepared crude protein lysates using lysis buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100). 100 μl of cell lysate was mixed with 40 μl of anti-FLAG agarose beads (Sigma) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with 1 ml of wash buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), mixed with 50 μl of loading buffer, boiled for 10 min, run on SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Osmonics). The filters were probed with anti-GFP antibody (Molecular Probes). GST Pull-downs—COS cells transfected with FLAG-Prdx6 were grown for 48 h, and cell extracts were prepared as described above. GST-STH was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and bound to glutathione-agarose beads (Novagen). 50 μl of the COS cell extracts were incubated with the beads bearing immobilized GST-STH fusion protein overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the beads were mixed with 50 μl of loading buffer, boiled 10 min, run on SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Osmonics). The filters were probed with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Immunocytochemistry—COS and SKN cells co-transfected with EGFP or EGFP-STH and FLAG-Prdx6 were grown on slides. 24 h after the change of medium, cells were rinsed three times with PBS and then fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde at 37 °C for 20 min. After fixation, we rinsed the cells once with PBS, permeabilized them with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 0.3% glutaraldehyde for 5 min at room temperature, and blocked them in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum at room temperature for 1 h. After blocking, cells were incubated with mouse-anti-FLAG (1:500, Sigma) and rabbit-anti-GFP (1:500, Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS 5 × 5 min, and then double-stained with Alexa Fluor 488 goat-anti-rabbit IgG (1:500, Molecular Probes) and Alexa Fluor 555 goat-anti-mouse IgG (1:500, Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. All antibodies were diluted in blocking solution. The slides were then washed 5 × 5 min with PBS, drained, dried, mounted with Gel Mount (Biomeda), and observed under a fluorescent microscope. Prdx6 Interacts with STH in a Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—To isolate proteins that interact with STH, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using LexA-STH as bait to screen a human fetal brain library. One of the clones identified in the yeast two-hybrid assay contained the complete cDNA of peroxiredoxin 6. Fig. 1A shows the expression of Prdx6 in human fetal brain and several human adult tissues. Fig. 1B shows a diagram of the Prdx6 activity motifs and mutants. The broad expression profile agrees with previous analyses that indicate that Prdx6 is widely expressed in tissues, including significant expression in brain (19Fujii T. Fujii J. Taniguchi N. Eur. J.

STH Associates with Prdx6 in Co-immunoprecipitations and in GST Pull-downs—To confirm the interaction between STH and Prdx6 in intact mammalian cells, expression constructs of GFP-tagged STH (Q and R alleles) and FLAG-tagged Prdx6 (wild-type and mutants S32A and C47S) were co-transfected into COS cells. Fig. 2, A and B, show that all fusion proteins express stable full-length proteins at equivalent amounts. We incubated cell lysates with anti-FLAG agarose and analyzed the immunoprecipitates by anti-GFP antibody in Western blots. The supernatants (not shown) contained equal amounts of STH. The Q version of STH interacts with all three Prdx6 variants, although the interaction with mutant S32A is slightly weaker (Fig. 2C). The R version of STH also interacts with all three Prdx6 variants, with the two mutants showing slightly stronger interaction than the wild type (Fig. 2D) To further confirm the interaction between STH and Prdx6, we performed GST pull-down assays. We expressed GST-STH fusion proteins of both Q and R alleles (Fig. 3A) and bound them to glutathione beads. We then incubated the GST-STH bound to beads with cell lysates transfected with FLAG-Prdx6 (wild type and both mutants) and performed immunoblotting of the material retained by the beads (after washing) using anti-FLAG antibody. Both the Q and the R alleles of STH brought down Prdx6, although they showed some differences. The R allele seemed to interact with all Prdx6 variants more strongly than the Q allele, but the relative strength of interaction was the same for both Q and R; C47S is the strongest, and S32A is the weakest (Fig. 3B). The weaker interaction of S32A correlates with the slightly reduced interaction also seen in immunoprecipitations (Fig. 2C). However, the differences in the GST pull-down were exaggerated when compared with those seen in cells, suggesting that the interaction may partly depend on post-translational modifications absent in bacterial cells. STH Co-localizes with Prdx6 in Cells—To examine the localization of the two interacting proteins in cells, we co-transfected EGFP-STH and FLAG-Prdx6 into COS (Fig. 4A) and SKN (Fig. 4B) cells and tracked them using immunofluorescence. In both COS and SKN cells, Prdx6 localizes mostly in the cytoplasm, showing a mesh-like distribution with higher concentration around the nucleus (Fig. 4, A and B, left panels). There are also a few focus-like areas in the nucleus. The distribution is consistent with results from other groups, who report that Prdx6 is found predominantly in the cytoplasm but that some also localizes to the nucleus (23Wood Z.A. Schroder E. Robin Harris J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar). STH shows a distribution similar in location and pattern to that of Prdx6 in COS cells (Fig. 4, A and B, middle panel). The merged scan (Fig. 4, A and B, right panel) shows that the two indeed largely overlap. STH Combined with Prdx6 Activates Splicing of tau Exon 10—STH is nested in the tau locus, its expression profile is congruent with that of tau (1Conrad C. Vianna C. Freeman M. Davies P. Proc. Natl.

For all these reasons, we were curious to see whether STH, alone or in combination with its Prdx6 ligand, influences tau exon 10, which is misspliced in several neurodegenerative diseases (24Goedert M. Jakes R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1739: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 25Andreadis A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1739: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). STH increases inclusion of exon 10 by itself, the Q allele weakly, and the R allele moderately (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Wild-type or mutant S32A Prdx6 does not alter inclusion of exon 10 (lanes 4 and 7), but mutant C47S moderately increases exon 10 inclusion (lane 10). When combined, STH and Prdx6 strongly activated exon 10 inclusion independently of whether Prdx6 is wild-type or mutant. The distinction between Q and R is retained; in all combinations, the Q allele is a weaker activator (lanes 5, 8, and 11) than its R counterpart (lanes 6, 9, and 12). Interestingly, the C47S Prdx6 mutant, which interacts most strongly with STH, also showed the highest relative activation of exon 10 splicing. Given its location, restricted evolutionary profile, and allele-specific correlations with neurodegenerative diseases, Saitohin is a truly intriguing molecule. Because of its shortness and lack of obvious motifs, its function has been elusive. Our study has identified an STH interactor that for the first time highlights molecular differences between the two STH alleles and gives some preliminary clues to the possible role(s) that STH may play in the cell. There are six peroxiredoxins in mammals, with broad but distinct expression ranges (23Wood Z.A. Schroder E. Robin Harris J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar). They are antioxidant enzymes that protect cells from damage caused by reactive oxygen species (19Fujii T.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar). Its promoter is regulated by factors responding to oxidative stress (21Lee T.H. Yu S.L.

Several characteristics of Prdx6 make it unique. Prdx6 is the longest peroxiredoxin and has a unique C-terminal domain used for dimerization (15Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Manevich Y. Chen J.W. Feinstein S.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 557: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although the other peroxiredoxins have two cysteine residues, Prdx6 has only one (at position 47, changed in mutant C47S, which lacks peroxidase activity). It is also bifunctional; in addition to its peroxidase activity, it has a Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 activity (15Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Manevich Y. Chen J.W. Feinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21326-21334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 16Chen J.W. Dodia C. Feinstein S.I. Jain M.K. Fisher A.B. J. Biol.

Levels of A2 phospholipases increase during neurodegeneration (32Farooqui A.A. Ong W.Y. Horrocks L.A. Neurochem. Res. 2004; 29: 1961-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Specifically, alterations in Prdx6 levels are associated with Pick disease, dementia with Lewy body disease, and sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (17Krapfenbauer K. Engidawork E. Cairns N.

Most interesting in connection with brain function is the finding that Prdx6 is elevated in Pick disease, a type of neurodegeneration related to progressive supranuclear palsy and frontotemporal dementia, both of which correlate with the STH Q allele (4Verpillat P. Ricard S. Hannequin D. Dobois B. Bou J. Camuzat A. Pradier L. Frebourg T. Brice A. Clerget-Darpoux F. Deleuze J.-F. Campion D. Ann.

Psychiatry. 2004; 75: 155-157PubMed Google Scholar). Quite intriguingly, all these types of dementia are tangle-only tauopathies. Moreover, some familial Pick disease and frontotemporal dementia pedigrees result directly from changes in ratios of tau exon 10 (24Goedert M. Jakes R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1739: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 25Andreadis A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1739: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), which are apparently also affected by STH and Prdx6 (Fig. 5). Our results showed that Prdx6 interacts with STH and that the two STH alleles show slight differences in this interaction. STH 7R interacted better with both mutants when compared with wild-type Prdx6. Prdx6 mutant S32A, which abolishes phospholipase activity (16Chen J.W. Dodia C. Feinstein S.I. Jain M.K. Fisher A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28421-28427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), is the weakest interactor of STH 7Q in cells and in vitro. Additionally, STH and Prdx6 together (particularly the 7R and C47S variants, respectively) significantly increased splicing of tau exon 10 by a yet undefined mechanism. The evidence is circumstantial but highly suggestive that STH, through its Prdx6 ligand, may be linked to the cascade of events that lead from tau splicing to neurodegeneration. Chimpanzees, which exclusively have the R STH allele, appear resistant to neurodegeneration, whereas the Q allele confers susceptibility to several tangle-only dementias. However, the picture is complicated by the fact that in humans, the R allele may be connected to the etiology of Alzheimer disease, which could correlate with its relative rarity in populations. The fact that STH Q allele is unique to humans makes it an invaluable tool to understanding why dementia seems to have singled out our species for preferential treatment.

To define the importance of receptor phosphorylation and β-arrestin binding in desensitization, and to determine whether β-arrestin binding and receptor endocytosis are required for receptor dephosphorylation, we expressed TRH receptors in fibroblasts from mice lacking β-arrestin-1 and/or β-arrestin-2. Apparent affinity for [3H]MeTRH was increased 8-fold in cells expressing β-arrestins, including a β-arrestin mutant that did not permit receptor internalization. TRH caused extensive receptor endocytosis in the presence of β-arrestins, but receptors remained primarily on the plasma membrane without β-arrestin. β-Arrestins strongly inhibited inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production within 10 s. At 30 min, endogenous β-arrestins reduced TRH-stimulated inositol phosphate production by 48% (β-arrestin-1), 71% (β-arrestin-2), and 84% (β-arrestins-1 and -2). In contrast, receptor phosphorylation, detected by the mobility shift of deglycosylated receptor, was unaffected by β-arrestins. Receptors were fully phosphorylated within 15 s of TRH addition. Receptor dephosphorylation was identical with or without β-arrestins and almost complete 20 min after TRH withdrawal. Blocking endocytosis with hypertonic sucrose did not alter the rate of receptor phosphorylation or dephosphorylation.

Upon exposure to agonist, the TRH receptor stimulates phospholipase Cβ through coupling to the GTP-binding proteins Gαq or Gα11, leading to the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and the subsequent release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum. This signaling pathway ultimately leads to the release of thyroid stimulating hormone and is essential for proper thyroid function and targeted deletion of the type 1 TRH receptor results in hypothyroidism (1.Rabeler R. Mittag J. Geffers L. Ruther U. Leitges M. Parlow A.F. Visser T.J. Bauer K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1450-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). When activated, most G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) undergo phosphorylation, which is followed by receptor interaction with β-arrestins and desensitization and endocytosis (2.Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation is carried out by second messenger-activated kinases, such as protein kinase C, or by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). Less is known about dephosphorylation, but it is believed to be a crucial step in the resensitization of GPCRs. Dephosphorylation of the well studied β2-adrenergic receptor is reported to take place in acidified endosomes (3.Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). As with most GPCRs, the activity of the TRH receptor is modulated by β-arrestins, which influence desensitization (4.Yu R. Hinkle P.M. J. Biol.

Following agonist binding, the TRH receptor becomes phosphorylated and rapidly recruits β-arrestin to the plasma membrane. The receptor-β-arrestin complex moves to pre-existing clathrin-coated regions (12.Scott M.G. Benmerah A. Muntaner O. Marullo S. J. Biol.

Following endocytosis, TRH receptors and β-arrestin are co-localized in cytoplasmic vesicles. The two non-visual arrestins, β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2, are ubiquitously expressed (17.Luttrell L.M.

The TRH receptor is an exception to this rule, because it recycles extensively following hormone withdrawal. Internalization of the TRH receptor is inhibited by dominant negative forms of β-arrestin and dynamin, as well as by truncation of the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor, which contains multiple phosphorylation sites. Mutant forms of β-arrestin that bind in a phosphorylation-independent manner promote agonist-independent internalization of TRH receptors lacking several potential phosphorylation sites in the carboxyl tail (14.Hanyaloglu A.C.

A number of critical questions remain unanswered for the TRH receptor and many other GPCRs. One is whether the receptor becomes uncoupled from G proteins as a consequence of phosphorylation, β-arrestin association, or both. Another is whether dephosphorylation and reactivation of the receptor require endocytosis, which would be predicted if the relevant phosphatase acts only on receptors in acidified endosomes, or whether dephosphorylation can take place at the plasma membrane. An additional uncertainty is whether the association of receptor with β-arrestin prolongs desensitization by blocking access of phosphatases to phosphorylated residues on the receptor. Here, we take advantage of fibroblasts from mice lacking β-arrestin 1 (βArr1KO), β-arrestin 2 (βArr2KO), or β-arrestins 1 and 2 (βArr1/2KO) and from wild-type (wt) littermates (21.Kohout T.A. Lin F.S. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar) to address these questions and analyze the roles of β-arrestins in desensitization, internalization, and dephosphorylation of the TRH receptor. Cell Cultures and Transfection—Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) from mice lacking β-arrestins were provided by Dr. Robert Lefkowitz (Duke University, Durham, NC). Gαq/11 KO MEFs derived from embryos lacking the α subunits of Gq and G11, were provided by Dr. Melvin Simon (California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA). MEFs, COS, and CHO cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with 5–10% fetal bovine serum and grown as monolayers in humidified 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. We transiently transfected cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) or FuGENE (Roche Diagnostics) following manufacturers' instructions. Cells were transfected with plasmids encoding TRH receptors tagged at the amino terminus with either hemagglutinin (HA) or FLAG epitopes (13.Zhu C.C. Cook L.B. Hinkle P.M. J. Biol.

When cells were transfected with cDNA encoding arrestins, a plasmid encoding GFP, a soluble protein of similar size, was used as a control. Cells were maintained in serum-containing media until assayed 24–48 h after transfection. Transfection efficiencies, which were estimated by transfecting with cDNA encoding GFP and staining nuclei with cell-permeable Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), varied from 11 to 19% in β-arrestin MEFs, 8–11% in Gαq/11 KO MEFs, and 45–55% in COS cells at different times. We found no consistent differences in transfection efficiencies between βArr1KO, βArr2KO, βArr1/2KO, and wt MEFs. βArr1/2KO cells stably expressing GFP-tagged TRH receptor were generated by co-transfecting with pTK-Hyg plasmid (Clontech) conferring resistance to hygromycin B, then adding 250 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen) 48 h after transfection and selecting stable clones. Radioligand Binding—To measure specific TRH binding, cells were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 or Hanks' balanced salt solution containing [3H]MeTRH (72 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30–90 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed on ice three times with ice-cold saline and collected in 0.1% SDS, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Protein concentrations were determined by using the Lowry method with bovine serum albumin as a standard. For Scatchard analysis, cells were incubated for 60 min with 0.67–20 nm [3H]MeTRH. Nonspecific binding, which was <5% of total binding, was measured in mock transfected dishes in all experiments. Inositol Phosphate Accumulation—To measure total inositol phosphate accumulation, we labeled transfected cells either immediately or 24 h after transfection with 2–5 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol overnight in F-10 media with 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were treated with 10 mm LiCl with or without TRH at 37 °C. Dishes were placed on ice, washed three times with ice-cold saline, and then incubated for 90 min in 50 mm formic acid at 4 °C. [3H]Inositol phosphates were subsequently isolated by ion exchange chromatography (22.Imai A. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10536-10540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioreceptor Assay of IP3—IP3 mass was measured by treating 35-mm dishes with 1 μm TRH in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline solution for various times at 37 °C. Dishes were then placed on ice, and IP3 was extracted by addition of 5% trichloroacetic acid. Samples were extracted with 3:1 trifluorotrichloroethane:octylamine, and IP3 was quantified using the Biotrak Assay System from Amersham Biosciences (Buckinghamshire, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation and Deglycosylation—CHO cells expressing HA-tagged TRH receptor in 35-mm dishes or MEFs transfected in 60-mm dishes were treated as detailed. Immunoprecipitation of receptors was carried out as described (13.Zhu C.C. Cook L.B. Hinkle P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28228-28237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed on ice in 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0) containing 1:1000 protease inhibitor mixture set III (Calbiochem) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 100 nm sodium orthovanadate). After centrifugation, supernatants were incubated 12–18 h with 1:5000 monoclonal HA11 antibody (Covance, Berkeley, CA). After 1-h incubation with protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), samples were washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. Deglycosylation was performed using peptide N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) exactly as instructed by the manufacturer, and the reaction was terminated by addition of 5× sample buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm dithiothreitol, 10% SDS, 0.5% bromphenol blue, 50% glycerol, pH 6.8). Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitated and deglycosylated proteins were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel by SDS-PAGE as described (23.Cook L.B. Zhu C.C. Hinkle P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1777-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), except that SDS-PAGE was performed at 85–110 V, and in one experiment samples were loaded onto 10–20% PAGEr Gold Tris-Glycine gels (Cambrex, Baltimore, MD) and run at 125 V. Phosphorylation/Dephosphorylation—To measure TRH receptor phosphorylation, we treated transfected cells with 100 nm TRH for either 5 or 45 min, washed them three times with saline to remove excess agonist, then allowed the cells to recover for different times before they were harvested. We immunoprecipitated HA-tagged TRH receptors, deglycosylated, ran SDS-PAGE, and observed the mobility shift due to TRH receptor phosphorylation. To quantify and compare dephosphorylation rates in different cell types, the relative mobility of TRH receptor bands was measured using NIH Image version 1.63 or LabWorks Analysis Software (UVP, Upland, CA). Densitometry profiles graphing distance traveled versus density were generated for each lane. The mobility of the peak density was determined, and the relative mobility of TRH receptors in each lane was defined by assigning a value of 0 to the distance traveled by untreated TRH receptors and a value of 1 to the distance traveled by TRH receptors treated for 5 min with TRH. Alkaline Phosphatase Treatment—To confirm that TRH receptor up-shift is due to phosphorylation, we immunoprecipitated HA-tagged TRH receptors from stably transfected CHO cells and incubated them with 0, 4, 20, or 100 units/ml calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Calbiochem) for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were then deglycosylated and separated by SDS-PAGE as described above. Internalization—To follow internalization of the TRH receptor, we measured the acid resistance of specifically bound [3H]MeTRH. Cells were incubated in 5 nm [3H]MeTRH then washed on ice with ice-cold saline. Surface ligand was extracted with ice-cold acid/salt buffer (0.2 m acetic acid, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 2.5) and internalized ligand was extracted by solubilizing the cells in 0.1% SDS. Internalization was also measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using minor modifications of the procedure described by Song and Hinkle (24.Song, G. J., and Hinkle, P. M. (2005) Mol. Endocrinol., in pressGoogle Scholar). We also imaged receptors in βArr1/2KO MEFs stably expressing a GFP-tagged TRH receptor and transiently transfected with β-arrestin 2 and HcRed. Cells were plated on ECL (Upstate, Chicago, IL)-coated coverslips, transfected, stimulated with 1 μm TRH, and imaged on a fluorescence microscope as described previously (9.Cook L.B. Hinkle P.M. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 3095-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Translocation of GRK2—CHO cells stably transfected with TRH receptor in 6-cm dishes were incubated for 1 h in Hanks' balanced salt solution then stimulated with 1 μm TRH. Cells were placed on ice, and 3 ml of ice-cold TM buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.6) was added, dishes were scraped, and cells were allowed to swell for 20 min before being briefly vortexed and then centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to separate cytosolic (supernatant) and membrane (pellet) fractions. Pellets were resuspended by vortexing rigorously in 1 ml of TM buffer. GRK2 was immunoblotted with 1:500 polyclonal anti-GRK2 (C-15) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary. Other—All experiments were repeated a minimum of three times except those shown in Figs. 1E and 8A, which were performed twice. All points represent the mean and standard error of at least triplicate determinations, except in Fig. 1A and the βArr1/2KO points in Fig. 6C, which show the mean and range of duplicate determinations. Where error bars are not visible, they were within symbol size.FIGURE 8Role of GRK2 in TRH receptor phosphorylation. A, βArr1/2KO MEFs co-transfected with HA-tagged TRH receptor and wild-type GRK2 or dominant negative GRK2 were treated with 100 nm TRH for various times. TRH receptors were immunoprecipitated, deglycosylated, and resolved on SDS-PAGE. B, CHO cells stably expressing TRH receptors were incubated with or without 1 μm TRH for various times before membrane and cytosolic fractions were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.” Samples of cytosolic and membrane fractions corresponding to 0.5 and 1.5% of total, respectively, were run on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for GRK2. C, densitometric analysis of the GRK2 band from the pellet (membrane) samples in B, shown as the increase in membrane-associated GRK2 compared with unstimulated cells.

A, wt or βArr1/2KO MEFs transfected with HA-tagged TRH receptor were treated with 100 nm TRH for 0–45 min. After 5 min, some dishes were washed to remove TRH and then allowed to recover in the absence of hormone for 0–45 min. TRH receptors were immunoprecipitated, deglycosylated, and resolved on SDS-PAGE. C, cells were incubated as in A, except that 0.44 m sucrose was added 20 min before and during the experiment. B and C, densitometric analysis of gels was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Open circles show βArr1/2KO cells, and filled squares show wild-type cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Desensitization of the TRH Receptor by β-Arrestins—To assess the role of β-arrestins in the desensitization of TRH receptor signaling through phospholipase Cβ, we expressed the TRH receptor in wt, βArr1KO, βArr2KO, or βArr1/2KO MEFs. When cells were incubated with 5 nm [3H]MeTRH, specific binding per milligram of protein was consistently higher in cells expressing at least one β-arrestin subtype (Fig. 1A). We metabolically labeled cells from the same experiment with [3H]inositol and measured TRH-stimulated production of [3H]inositol phosphates over 30 min. Expression of either β-arrestin reduced TRH-stimulated production of 3H-labeled inositol phosphates (Fig. 1B). In comparison to the response in the absence of either β-arrestin, the TRH response was inhibited by 84% in wt cells expressing both β-arrestins, 48% in cells expressing only β-arrestin 1 and by 71% in cells expressing only β-arrestin 2. This result agrees with the report that β-arrestin 2 interacts with the TRH receptor more effectively than β-arrestin 1 based on the ability to promote endocytosis (20.Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). β-Arrestins 1 and 2 are present at approximately equal concentrations in the cell lines used (21.Kohout T.A. Lin F.S. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar). To eliminate the chance that differences in inositol phosphate production could be due to differences in the cell types rather than the activity of the TRH receptor, we also co-transfected βArr1/2KO MEFs with TRH receptor and β-arrestin 2. β-Arrestin 2 reduced the TRH response to that seen in wt cells in the same experiment (Fig. 1C). The magnitude of the TRH response varied among experiments, presumably due to variation in transfection efficiency, but in every instance expression of β-arrestin greatly reduced the TRH-stimulated increase in [3H]inositol phosphates. In numerous experiments using Western blots and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with and without permeabilization to quantify total and surface receptors we found that the concentration of TRH receptors was either not changed or slightly increased by co-expression of β-arrestin. The effect of TRH concentration on total inositol phosphate production in βArr1/2KO co-transfected with TRH receptor and either β-arrestin 2 or control plasmid is shown in Fig. 1D. The dose-response curve for MEFs with β-arrestin 2 was shifted to the left, but the maximal response was lower. To determine how rapidly β-arrestins desensitize TRH signaling, we measured IP3 mass by radioreceptor assay 10, 30, or 60 s after addition of TRH or vehicle. It was not feasible to measure the TRH-induced increase in total inositol phosphates at early time points because the signal was too small. At 10 s, TRH caused a 7.6-fold increase in IP3 in βArr1/2KO cells compared with a 3.4-fold increase in the same cells co-transfected with β-arrestin 2 (Fig. 1E). The increase in IP3 in wt MEFs was similar to that seen in βArr1/2KO cells overexpressing β-arrestin 2 (data not shown). These results show that β-arrestin powerfully inhibits TRH signaling within 10 s. Expression of TRH Receptors in MEFs—To study the role of β-arrestins in the regulation of the TRH receptor, we transiently expressed the receptor in βArr1KO, βArr2KO, βArr1/2KO, and wt MEFs. Because β-arrestins increased [3H]MeTRH binding (Fig. 1A) and have been reported to increase the binding affinity of receptors for their agonists (25.Gurevich V.V. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. Onorato J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28849-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 26.Key T.A. Foutz T.D. Gurevich V.V. Sklar L.A. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4041-4047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we carried out equilibrium binding studies in live βArr1/2KO and wt MEFs transiently transfected with TRH receptor with or without co-transfection of β-arrestins. Scatchard analysis showed that affinity for [3H]MeTRH was ∼8-fold higher in cells expressing β-arrestins, although maximal binding values were similar. Kd values were 1.67 nm (wt), 1.37 nm (βArr1/2KO+βArr2), and 13.1 nm (βArr1/2KO) (Fig. 2A). In three different experiments, the apparent Kd for the TRH receptor expressed in βArr1/2KO cells was 7.2 to 9.6 times the Kd measured in cells expressing β-arrestin. In signaling experiments, cells were stimulated with 1 μm TRH, a concentration sufficient to occupy more than 98% of receptors in all of the cell lines. In the experiment depicted in Fig. 2A, Bmax values were 50.0, 38.4, and 61.0 fmol/dish in wt, βArr1/2KO+βArr2, and βArr1/2KO cells, respectively, but no consistent differences in maximal binding of the various lines were noted in multiple experiments when cells were transfected at similar densities. To eliminate the possibility that increased binding was due to internalization of radioligand, we co-transfected βArr1/2KO MEFs with TRH receptor and control plasmid, β-arrestin 1, or β-arrestin 1 ΔLIELD/F391A, a mutant arrestin that binds normally to phosphorylated receptors but cannot bind clathrin or adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) (27.Kim Y.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30760-30768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). TRH-induced internalization was similar in MEFs lacking β-arrestins and those transfected with β-arrestin 1 ΔLIELD/F391A, but was 3.5-fold higher in MEFs transfected with wild type β-arrestin 1 (Fig. 2B). Importantly, the ability of β-arrestin 1 ΔLIELD/F391A to desensitize the TRH receptor was the same as that of wild type β-arrestin 1 (Fig. 2C), and so it appears to bind normally to TRH receptor. Equilibrium binding studies and Scatchard analysis showed that β-arrestin 1 ΔLIELD/F391A increased affinity for [3H]MeTRH despite its inability to direct receptor internalization (Fig. 2D). Kd values were 1.10 nm with β-arrestin 1 ΔLIELD/F391A compared with 8.22 nm with control plasmid. When equilibrium binding studies were carried out in βArr1/2KO and wild-type MEFs at 0 °C, where no receptor phosphorylation or β-arrestin binding would be expected, the apparent affinity for [3H]MeTRH was the same, ∼9nm (data not shown). Impaired Internalization in Cells Lacking β-Arrestin—To visualize TRH receptor internalization after agonist treatment, a line of βArr1/2KO MEFs stably expressing a GFP-tagged TRH receptor was prepared. These cells were co-transfected with β-arrestin 2 and HcRed, allowing easy identification of successfully transfected (red) cells (Fig. 3A). In cells expressing β-arrestin 2, TRH caused distinct receptor internalization by 10 min and extensive endocytosis after 30 min, as indicated by the punctate appearance of GFP-TRH receptor in endosomes. In contrast, TRH caused minimal changes in receptor localization in cells lacking any β-arrestin. We also measured internalization in wt and βArr1/2KO MEFs transiently transfected with TRH receptor with or without β-arrestin 2 by measuring the percent of specifically bound [3H]MeTRH in an acid-resistant (internalized) form at intervals. Internalization was slower and less extensive in the absence of β-arrestins, reaching a maximum of only 25% in 15 min in βArr1/2KO cells compared with 45% in wt MEFs and 65% in βArr1/2KO MEFs overexpressing β-arrestin 2 (Fig. 3B). Effect of β-Arrestin Concentration—To determine the dependence of desensitization and internalization on β-arrestin concentration, βArr1/2KO"
https://openalex.org/W1997386033,"We have purified a protein present in a conditioned medium derived from the metanephric mesenchyme that supports non-branching growth and epithelial differentiation of the isolated ureteric bud (UB) independent of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic growth factor (GDNF). By sequential liquid chromatography, together with protein microsequencing, the protein was identified as heregulin (HRG)α. The addition of recombinant HRG to the isolated UB grown in three-dimensional culture confirmed the proliferative activity of HRG. In branching UBs induced by whole metanephric mesenchyme cell-conditioned medium, proliferating cells were localized at ampullae, where a binding receptor for GDNF, GFRα1, was found. In HRG-induced UBs, however, the expression of GFRα1 was down-regulated, and proliferating cells were distributed throughout the structure. Electron microscopic examination of the HRG-induced UB revealed the presence of structurally mature and polarized epithelial cells reminiscent of the epithelial cells found in the stalk portion of the branching UB. cDNA array analysis further revealed that genes ontologically classified as developmental were down-regulated by HRG, whereas those involved in transport were up-regulated. For example, the mRNA for the GDNF receptors, GFRα1 and ret9, was down-regulated, whereas the mRNA for collecting duct transporters, such as urea transporter2, aquaporin3, and sodium-hydrogen exchanger2 was up-regulated in HRG-treated UBs compared with UBs grown in the presence of branch-promoting factors. Moreover, HRG promoted growth of UBs cultured in the absence of GDNF. Taken together, the data suggest that HRG supports UB epithelial cell differentiation and non-GDNF-dependent growth, raising the possibility that this kind of activity plays a role in the growth and differentiation of the stalk portion of the branching epithelial UB.

Branching morphogenesis is essential for the development of many epithelial organs including the lung, salivary gland, mammary gland, and kidney. In the kidney, growth factors such as glial cell line-derived neurotrophic growth factor (GDNF), 5The abbreviations used are: GDNFglial cell line-derived neurotrophic growth factorPTNpleiotrophinFGFfibroblast growth factorUBureteric budHRGheregulin.5The abbreviations used are: GDNFglial cell line-derived neurotrophic growth factorPTNpleiotrophinFGFfibroblast growth factorUBureteric budHRGheregulin. pleiotrophin (PTN), fibroblast growth factor (FGF)s, and transforming growth factor-β superfamily have been implicated in this process. However, beyond cell proliferation and survival, how the actions of these growth factors translate into forming a branched tubular or ductal structure is not well understood. glial cell line-derived neurotrophic growth factor pleiotrophin fibroblast growth factor ureteric bud heregulin. glial cell line-derived neurotrophic growth factor pleiotrophin fibroblast growth factor ureteric bud heregulin. To form a branching structure, it appears necessary to have clear tip and stalk regions. In fact, it has recently been shown that there are at least two distinct cell types in the developing ureteric bud, ret-expressing tip cells and ret-negative stalk cells (1Shakya R. Watanabe T. Costantini F. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 65-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These cells clearly have different fates, tip cells are fated to remain within the tip and make new branches or to move toward the stalk region to become stalk cells, whereas stalk cells are fated to remain within the stalk portion. For ret-expressing tip cells, GDNF plays an important role in their maintenance. Bone morphogenetic protein 4 and FGF1 or FGF10 have been suggested to facilitate the elongation of the stalk (2Miyazaki Y. Oshima K. Fogo A. Hogan B.L. Ichikawa I. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 863-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 3Qiao J. Bush K.T. Steer D.L. Stuart R.O. Sakurai H. Wachsman W. Nigam S.K. Mech. Dev. 2001; 109: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar); however, factors that largely or exclusively cause proliferation and epithelial differentiation without branching, such as occurs in elongating stalks, have not been reported. For an isolated UB to grow and branch robustly in vitro, GDNF alone is not sufficient. Conditioned medium from metanephric mesenchyme derived cells (BSN-CM) is required. Previously, we isolated PTN from this conditioned medium and were able to demonstrate that a combination of PTN and GDNF is sufficient to induce in vitro branching morphogenesis of the isolated UB (4Sakurai H. Bush K.T. Nigam S.K. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3283-3293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the fractionation of this medium and isolation of PTN, the presence of a potent non-branch-promoting yet growth-inducing factor was noted. Here, we have purified this factor from BSN-CM and have identified it as heregulin (HRG). Close examination of the HRG-induced UB revealed that the cells of these non-branching UBs displayed a predominant stalk cell-like morphology and expressed markers of maturation, raising the possibility that HRG may act as a stalk-promoting factor. Recombinant growth factors, GDNF, and HRGα were from R&D systems. FGF1 was purchased from Calbiochem. The metanephric mesenchyme-derived cell line (BSN cells) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Conditioned medium was collected after incubation with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 for 3-4 days. 2-3 liters of BSN-CM was concentrated ∼50-fold by Ultrasette tangential flow devices (5K molecular weight cutoff; Gelman Sciences). Morphogenetic activity of BSN-CM was retained in the >5,000 Dalton fraction, but not in the <5,000 Dalton flow-through. The buffer of the concentrated BSN-CM was changed to 0.4 m NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, buffer and applied to a heparin-Sepharose column (HiTrap Heparin 5 ml, Amersham Bioscience). Heparin-bound proteins were eluted via increasing concentrations of NaCl (0.4-2 m), and individual 5-ml fractions were collected. The 0.9-1.2 m NaCl heparin eluate fractions were adjusted to 1.7 m ammonium sulfate in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, buffer and applied to a Resource Phenyl hydrophobic interaction column (Amersham Bioscience). Bound proteins were eluted via decreasing concentrations of ammonium sulfate (1.7-0 m) in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, buffer. The 1.5-1.6 m ammonium sulfate fractions were dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, buffer and applied to a Resource S cation exchange column (Amersham Bioscience), followed by elution with increasing concentrations of NaCl (0-1 m). The morphogenetic activity of each fraction collected from this column was assayed using the isolated rat UB culture system (see below). An apparently homogenous protein band (see Fig. 1B, lane 2) was excised from Sypro-Ruby (Bio-Rad) stained Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Cambrex) and analyzed by in gel digestion followed by microcapillary HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry (Harvard Microchem). Isolated Rat UB Culture—As previously described (4Sakurai H. Bush K.T. Nigam S.K. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3283-3293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Qiao J. Sakurai H. Nigam S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7330-7335Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), UBs were microdissected from E13 rat embryonic kidney and suspended within extracellular matrix gels (1:1 mixture of type 1 collagen and growth factor reduced Matrigel, BD Biosciences), applied to the inner wells of a 24-well Transwell insert (Costar, 0.4-μm pore size). UBs were cultured in either whole BSN-CM (positive control), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (negative control), dialyzed fractions (to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12) or recombinant HRG (250-500 ng/ml); 125 ng/ml of GDNF, 250 ng/ml of FGF1, and 10% fetal calf serum, were also added to the outer wells in most cases. These cultures were placed in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Phase-contrast pictures were taken with Spot RT digital camera attached to Nikon microscope. In some cases, cultures were stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) and observed by scanning laser confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM-510). Image analysis was done by Image Pro software. Electron Microscopy—Isolated UBs cultured for 5 days in the presence of HRG as described above were fixed in Karnovsky's fixative for 1 h at room temperature and processed for ultrastructural analysis as described previously (3Qiao J. Bush K.T. Steer D.L. Stuart R.O. Sakurai H. Wachsman W. Nigam S.K. Mech. Dev. 2001; 109: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thin sections were mounted onto mesh grids, stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate, and examined with a Zeiss EM109 microscope. BrdUrd Incorporation Assay—As previously described (3Qiao J.

Dev. 2001; 109: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), cultured ureteric buds grown for 4-5 days were labeled with 10 μm BrdUrd for 30 min. After extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the UBs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. The incorporated BrdUrd was detected following a protocol of the Cell Proliferation kit (Amersham Biosciences) except for the use of fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) as a secondary antibody. After counterstaining with rhodamine-conjugated Dolichos biflorus lectin (Vector Lab), the samples were analyzed by scanning laser confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM-510). cDNA Array—For each treatment (HRG, BSN-CM, PTN), three isolated UBs were cultured in the presence of FGF1, GDNF, and indicated factor for 4 days. For each condition, 3 separate wells were prepared. RNA was isolated using PicoPure RNA isolation kit (Arcturus). Double IVT reaction and hybridization to Affymetrix rat gene chip 230A was performed at UCSD Cancer center GeneChip core facility. GCOS (Affymetrix) and Genesifter (VizX lab) software was used for data analysis. The gene expression data are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus website (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/, accession number GSE3394). Immunohistochemistry—Whole-mount staining of isolated UBs in three-dimensional culture was performed as described elsewhere (6Meyer T.N. Schwesinger C. Bush K.T. Stuart R.O. Rose D.W. Shah M.M.

Antibodies/staining reagents were as follows: Topro-3 nuclear staining dye (1:1000, Molecular Probes), goat anti-rat GFRα1 antibody (1 μg/ml, R&D systems), rabbit anti-occludin antibody (1:100, Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and mouse anti-β-catenin monoclonal antibody (1:200, BD Transduction Lab). The samples were observed with Zeiss LSM-510 confocal microscopy. BSN-CM Contains Non-branching Growth-inducing Activity for the Isolated UB—Fractionation of BSN-CM by multiple sequential liquid column chromatography has consistently revealed the presence of several growth-inducing activities in BSN-CM including a non-branching yet growth-inducing activity as well as a branch-promoting activity and an inhibitory activity. Thus far, a branch-promoting factor (PTN) (4Sakurai H. Bush K.T. Nigam S.K. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3283-3293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and growth/branch-inhibiting factors (transforming growth factor-β superfamily) (7Bush K.T. Sakurai H. Steer D.L. Leonard M.O. Sampogna R.V. Meyer T.N. Schwesinger C. Qiao J. Nigam S.K. Dev. Biol. 2004; 266: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) have been identified. In this study, we have purified a non-branching growth-inducing factor, which on a heparin-Sepharose column was found to elute prior to the branch-promoting activity (data not shown). This fraction was further separated on a Resource Phenyl-Sepharose column, and the non-branching growth-inducing activity was found to elute around 1.5-1.6 m ammonium sulfate (Fig. 1A). Heregulin α in BSN-CM Induces Non-branching Growth of the Isolated UB—This fraction from the Resource Phenyl column was further separated by Resource S cation exchange chromatography, and an apparently homogenous protein containing fraction with non-branching growth inducing activity was obtained (Fig. 1). The homogenous protein band eluted from the Resource S column at 0.6 m NaCl (in Fig. 1B, a band between 40 and 50 kilodalton present in fraction 2) was subsequently identified as HRGα by mass spectrometry. As expected, recombinant human HRGα induced non-branching growth of the isolated UB comparable with that seen with the native purified protein (Fig. 1C). Heregulin-α Induces Non-branching Polarized Epithelial Proliferation of the Ureteric Bud in Three-dimensional Culture—To further evaluate the morphogenetic effect of HRGα, isolated UBs were cultured in the presence and absence of HRGα for several days. HRG stimulated overall growth of the isolated UB in the presence of GDNF and FGF1, compared with growth in the presence of only GDNF and FGF1, leading to the formation of non-branching structures morphologically distinct from BSN-CM-treated UBs (Fig. 1C). Confocal microscopic examination of phalloidin-stained UBs revealed the presence of a clear lumen with a much larger caliber in HRG-treated UBs compared with controls (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, electron microscopy demonstrated that the cells comprising these structures were epithelial in nature with characteristics usually associated with polarized epithelial cells. For example, the nuclei were uniformly localized to the basal portion of the cells, and intercellular junctions were readily apparent, presumably leading to the separation of basolateral and apical membrane domains. The apical aspect of the cells contained multiple secretory granules, which can be seen in contact with the luminal surface (Fig. 2B, c, arrows). As expected, the adherens junction-associated protein, β-catenin, was localized at the site of cell-cell contact, and the tight junction protein, occludin, was localized at the luminal side (Fig. 2C). Heregulin Treatment Does Not Maintain GFRα1 Expression and Leads to GDNF-independent Growth and Maturation of the Ureteric Bud—We next sought to investigate how HRG induced non-branching growth. To address this question, the gene expression profile of either whole BSN-CM or PTN-treated branching UBs was compared with the HRG treated UBs on cDNA arrays. First, the overall gene expression profile among HRG-treated, non-branching UBs, and either BSN-CM- or PTN-treated branching UBs was compared using the MAPPFinder algorithm built into the Genesifter application) (8Doniger S.W. Salomonis N. Dahlquist K.D. Vranizan K. Lawlor S.C. Conklin B.R. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This analysis provides information on the probability (i.e. Z score) that a change in expression of a group of genes (i.e. ontological class) is because of random chance or is likely to be a real effect. A gene was included in the analysis when the gene was determined to be either present in all three experiments or present in two experiments and one marginal in at least one treatment condition. Of these genes, the differentially regulated (i.e. >1.5-fold at p < 0.05) genes were categorized according to their ontology (Fig. 3A). Genes up-regulated by PTN treatment were over-represented (Z score > 2) by genes thought to be involved in cell proliferation and development, whereas transport-related genes were under-represented (Z score <-2). Genes thought to be involved in acid metabolism were over-represented in the group of genes down-regulated by PTN. Genes involved in cell communication, signal transduction, and developmental processes were under-represented in groups down-regulated by PTN. Similar to the comparison of HRG versus PTN, genes involved in cell proliferation and development were over-represented among those genes up-regulated by BSN-CM treatment. Genes involved in metabolism were over-represented among those genes down-regulated by BSN-CM treatment, whereas genes involved in cell communication, signal transduction, and development were under-represented in this group of genes. From this data analysis, we hypothesized that HRG-treatment decreases the overall proliferation of isolated UBs compared with pro-branching factors such as BSN-CM and PTN and directs them toward maturation. When we examined specific gene expression, it was noted that the expression level of both the binding receptor for GDNF, GFRα1, and the signal transducing receptor, ret, were down-regulated in the HRG-treated condition (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, consistent with the ultrastructural finding that mature appearing epithelial cells were lining HRG-treated UBs, the expression level of transporter genes expressed in the mature collecting duct, such as aquaporin3, the urea transporter, and sodium hydrogen exchanger 2, was up-regulated in HRG-treated condition (Fig. 3B). The down-regulation of GFRα1 was confirmed at the protein level by immunostaining (Fig. 4A, a). In the BSN-CM-treated branching UB, GFRα1 was localized predominantly at the UB tip, whereas its expression was dramatically reduced in the HRG-treated UB. This expression pattern of GFRα1 raised the possibility that the “tip cell phenotype” is diminished in the HRG-treated UB. Because most of the proliferating cells found in the UB have been shown to localize at the tip (1Shakya R. Watanabe T. Costantini F. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 65-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 3Qiao J. Bush K.T. Steer D.L. Stuart R.O. Sakurai H. Wachsman W. Nigam S.K. Mech.

Anat. 2004; 204: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we examined the pattern of proliferation by BrdUrd incorporation. In contrast to the BSN-CM-treated branching UB, in which most proliferating cells are localized at the tip, proliferating cells in HRG-treated UB displayed no specific localization (Fig. 4A, b). Together with down-regulation of tip-localized GDNF receptors, Gfra1 and Ret, HRG is likely to stimulate non-GDNF-dependent UB cell proliferation that may be operational in stalk growth. The fact that HRG-treated UBs did not grow as large as BSN-CM-treated UBs (Fig. 4A), together with overall down-regulation of cell proliferation genes in the HRG-treated condition versus BSN-CM-treated condition, suggests that this proproliferative effect is weaker than that of tip proliferation-inducing factors. Nevertheless, we further went on to confirm the ability of HRG to induce UB cell proliferation independent of GDNF. It was possible to maintain isolated UB survival in the presence of FGF1 without significant growth (Fig. 4B, control). Addition of HRG (without GDNF present) to this condition facilitated the growth as indicated by the increase in UB area (Fig. 4B). These HRG-treated UBs appeared to retain tubular epithelial structure with lumen as shown by confocal microscopy (Fig. 4B). Taken together, our data suggest that HRG does not maintain the tip cell phenotype but promotes differentiation of the isolated UB, making it all stalk phenotype. Moreover, non-branching growth of the UBs induced by HRG treatment is independent of GDNF, raising the possibility that tip and stalk cells in the branching epithelial tissue are under the control of different sets of growth factors. BSN-CM, derived from metanephric mesenchyme cells, contains at least three apparently independent morphogenetic activities that stimulate the isolated UB in three-dimensional culture: 1) a branch-promoting activity, 2) a non-branching growth-inducing activity, and 3) an inhibitory activity (4Sakurai H. Bush K.T. Nigam S.K. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3283-3293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bush K.T. Sakurai H. Steer D.L. Leonard M.O. Sampogna R.V. Meyer T.N. Schwesinger C. Qiao J. Nigam S.K. Dev. Biol. 2004; 266: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The presence of these multiple activities is consistent with a model of UB branching where multiple soluble factors secreted from the metanephric mesenchyme, perhaps under different spatial and temporal conditions, regulate the growth and shape of the UB-derived tubular tree. This is very different from cell culture models of branching in which a single growth factor (e.g. hepatocyte growth factor in MDCK cells or epidermal growth factor receptor ligands in mIMCD3 cells) is sufficient to induce growth and branching. Previous studies have identified proteins likely to be responsible for the branch-promoting (3Qiao J. Bush K.T. Steer D.L. Stuart R.O. Sakurai H. Wachsman W. Nigam S.K. Mech. Dev. 2001; 109: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 4Sakurai H. Bush K.T. Nigam S.K. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3283-3293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Qiao J. Sakurai H.

In this study, we have isolated a non-branching yet growth-inducing factor from BSN-CM and have identified it as HRGα. Both natural and recombinant HRG reproducibly induced the non-branching growth of the isolated UB in three-dimensional culture. HRGα was originally isolated from a breast cancer cell line as an activator of the oncogene/transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor erbB2 (10Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Henzel W.J. Lee J.

HRGα is 1 of at least 15 isoforms differentially spliced from the neuregulin1 transcript (12Lemke G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 247-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar).

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4900-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Neuregulin1 transcripts have been detected in mesenchyme of the lung, intestine, stomach, kidney, and the genital ridge in early mouse development (18Meyer D. Birchmeier C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1064-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In organ culture of the mammary gland, HRG has been shown to stimulate alveolar differentiation, whereas different growth factors stimulate branching morphogenesis (19Yang Y. Spitzer E. Meyer D. Sachs M. Niemann C. Hartmann G. Weidner K.M. Birchmeier C. Birchmeier W. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 131: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 20Niemann C. Brinkmann V. Spitzer E. Hartmann G. Sachs M. Naundorf H. Birchmeier W. J. Cell. Biol. 1998; 143: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Our results using the isolated UB culture system are potentially compatible with this observation. HRG did not stimulate branching morphogenesis, but it promoted growth and maturation of the UB. Cells comprising these structures were epithelial in nature with characteristics associated with tight polarized epithelial cells (Fig. 2). We demonstrated that HRG-induced growth could be explained by loss of total and differential expression of GFRα1 (Figs. 3 and 4). We speculate that the presence of GFRα1 in cells at the branching tip might be a prerequisite for the UB to undergo branching morphogenesis. Thus, if GFRα1 were ubiquitously expressed along the UB at a relatively high level, the UB would be expected to display an “all-tip” phenotype, resulting in globular growth without any apparent stalk formation. On the other hand, if GFRα1 expression were reduced or non-existent, tip cells would not be able to respond to GDNF and would be expected to display an “all-stalk” phenotype. We suggest this is the case in UBs treated with HRG. Moreover, losing tip phenotype from the UB seems to confer maturation toward the collecting duct epithelium. Other conditions that lead to down-regulation of ret and GFRα1 (e.g. FGF1 alone or FGF1 and GDNF) also induced increased transporter/water channel expression as seen with HRG treatment. 6H.

The best characterized substrates are the ET family consisting of three isopeptides, termed ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3, which are derived from distinct genes (9Yanagisawa M. Kurihara H. Kimura S. Mitsui Y.

ET-1, the most abundant of the three, is a pleiotropic peptide; although best known for its vasoconstricting activity it has diverse biological functions. These include roles in processes such as embryonic development, cardiovascular homeostasis, vascular permeability, and angiogenesis (11Kedzierski R.M. Yanagisawa M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

ETs are synthesized from ∼200-amino acid precursor-prepro ET (ppET). After removal of their signal peptide ETs are processed by dibasic pair-specific enzymatic activity to form the respective inactive big-ETs (38-41 residues long (1Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C.

Inhibitors of ECE-1 are considered to be valuable therapeutic agents and were developed for the treatment of various disorders linked to elevated ET-1 levels (27Jeng A.Y. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2003; 4: 1076-1081PubMed Google Scholar, 28Jeng A.Y. Mulder P. Kwan A.L. Battistini B. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2002; 80: 440-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Numerous peptides or non-peptidyl ECE-1 inhibitors have already been produced, but contrary to initial expectations, none is currently used for therapeutic purposes, perhaps because of insufficient knowledge of the ECE-1 family of proteins in naturally expressing cells. In this paper we report the prevalence of ECE-1 isoforms a-d in EC and the initial characterization of a novel splice variant of ECE-1 that lacks the transmembrane domain. Materials—Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM) low glucose, DMEM with Ham's F-12 1:1 (v/v) nutrient mixture, Super-ScriptII RNase H-reverse transcriptase, calf serum, and ultra pure electrophoresis agarose gel were obtained from Invitrogen. Vitrogen, type I collagen from Cohesion Technologies (Palo Alto, CA). Penicillin, streptomycin, and fetal calf serum were from Biological Industries (Beit Haemek, Israel). TRI Reagent from was from Molecular Research Center (Cincinnati, OH). Deoxynucleotide triphosphates, random hexamer oligodeoxynucleotides, and TaqDNA polymerase were from Fermentas (Vilnius, Lithuania). Oligo(dT) and oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by MWG Biotech AG (Ebersberg, Germany). The real-time PCR SYBR-Green master-mix kit was from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). Protease inhibitor mixture for mammalian cell extracts and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were from Sigma. The protein quantification kit was from Bio-Rad.

BK-2 was synthesized by Sigma-Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). Cell Cultures—Bovine aortic EC (BAEC) were kindly provided by I. Vlodavsky of the Hadassah-Hebrew University Hospital, (Jerusalem, Israel), and the cells were grown in complete DMEM containing 10% calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. Microvascular EC derived from the bovine corpus luteum (29Spanel-Borowski K. Fenyves A. Arzneimittelforschung. 1994; 44: 385-391PubMed Google Scholar, 30Spanel-Borowski K.

Experiments were carried out on cells from passages 5-12, with 70-80% confluence. Human embryonic kidney cell cultures (HEK-293) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell cultures were cultured in complete DMEM Ham's F-12 containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. Enrichment of Luteal Steroidogenic and Endothelial Cells—For enrichment of luteal cell subpopulations, mid-cycle corpora lutea were dispersed by using collagenase IV as described previously (5Levy N. Gordin M. Smith M.F. Bolden-Tiller O.U. Meidan R. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 1361-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 32Levy N. Gordin M. Mamluk R. Yanagisawa M. Smith M.F. Hampton J.H. Meidan R. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 5254-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, corpora lutea were sliced and dispersed in M-199 containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and collagenase (420 units/ml). Dispersed luteal cells were mixed with epoxy magnetic beads precoated with Bandeiraea simplicifolia lectin-1 (BS-1), a lectin specific for bovine EC. Both BS-1-positive cells (EC) and non-adherent cells (enriched steroidogenic cells) were collected and further processed for RNA extraction. Production of bECE-1 Constructs—The cDNA sequences of full-length bovine ECE-1d and ECE-1d splice variant (SV) were amplified with 1d and ECE-1-end as primers (TABLE ONE). The amplification products were separated on agarose gels and the corresponding single bands were extracted and cloned onto pGEM-TEasy vector. Inserts were subsequently subcloned into pcDNA vector (pcDNA6/V5) and sequenced. ECE-1d and SV plasmids were mutated (mut) at the putative start site of the latter (ATG located between bases 207-209) as follows: 26-bp complementary sense and antisense oligonucleotides, containing the desired mutation (ATG to TTT), were used in a PCR reaction with the original SV plasmid as a template. Template plasmid was then digested with DpnI. A shorter SVcut construct lacking the first 169 bp of SV was generated by digesting SV with Eco91I (BstEII). HEK-293 cells were transfected by FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. Stably transfected cells lines (containing bECE-1d, SV, and SVcut) were established using blasticidin (1 μg/ml) as a selective antibiotic.TABLE ONEPCR primer listGenePrimerSequenceProduct lengthG3PDHForward5′-GGCGTGAACCACGAGAAGTAT-3′141Reverse5′-CGTGGACAGTGGTCATAAGT-3′ECE-1, totalForward5′-TGTGGCGGCTGGATCAAAGC-3′103Reverse5′-AGGTGCTTGATGATGGCTTG-3′ECE-1aForward5′-GTTCCTCTCCTGGATTAG-3′178Reverse5′-CTTGTCTGGTATTGGATGC-3′ECE-1bForward5′-TGTCGGCGCTGGGGATGTC-3′113ECE-1cForward5′-CGGAGCGCGCGAGCGAT-3′109ECE-1dForward5′-CCATGGAGGCGCTAAGAGAGT-3′142ECE-1b, -c, and -dReverse5′-GAAGTTCACCTGCAGGTGGT-3′ECE-svForward5′-TACCCCAACCACCTGCAGGAACG-3′226Reverse5′-AGGTGCTTGATGATGGCTTG-3′ECE-1, full- lengthForward5′-GCAGGTGAACTTCCGAGG-3′150Reverse5′-CTTGTCTGGTATTGGATGC-3′ECE-1, commonReverse5′-GAAGGGGGAGGTGTGGTAGT-3′1a: 5711b: 5031c: 5071d: 533ECE-1, endReverse5′-CCCTTCACCAGACTTCACACT-3′1d: 2312SV: 2170 Open table in a new tab Cell Fractionation and Western Blot Analysis—The procedure for total cell extracts was carried out as we have previously described (32Levy N.

Spanel-Borowski K. Meidan R. Reproduction. 2004; 128: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were homogenized in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, at pH 7.5 and 10% protease inhibitor mixture). Cell extracts were sonicated on ice for 10 s at low speed. For subcellular localization of ECE-1 forms, HEK-293 cells were homogenized in lysis buffer without detergents and then centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g. The resulting pellet (containing particulate fraction) was dissolved in lysis buffer containing 0.5% deoxycholate and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The supernatant was centrifuged at 44,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant obtained after ultracentrifugation was defined as the cytosolic fraction. The cytosol and cell particulate fractions were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, under reducing conditions. Protein concentrations were determined by using Bio-Rad DC reagents. All steps were performed on ice, and samples were kept at -80 °C until use. Proteins were electrically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After 2 h blocking in TBST (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) + 5% low fat milk, membranes were incubated with the appropriate ECE-1 antibodies. Anti-total ECE-1 antiserum (anti COOH-terminal antibody: 4788) was raised against a synthetic peptide comprising the last 16 amino acids of ECE-1 and was affinity purified by means of the immunizing peptide immobilized on a Sepharose 4B column. Two antibodies raised against NH2-terminal sequences of ECE-1 were also used: ds-90, which recognizes the cytosolic sequence of ECE-1d, and 1207, which recognizes ECE-1bcd (34Muller L. Valdenaire O. Barret A. Korth P. Pinet F. Corvol P. Tougard C. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2000; 36: S15-S18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were washed three times and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti rabbit IgG for 1 h at room temperature. A chemiluminescent signal was generated with SuperSignal and the membranes were exposed to x-ray film. Cell-free Transcription/Translation System (TNT)—The T7 transcription/translation system with [35S]methionine was used to probe translated products of the various plasmids (bECE-1d, bECE-1d-mut SV, Svmut, and SVcut). Briefly, 1 mg of plasmid DNA was incubated with TNT master mix (Promega) and [35S]methionine, 90 min at 30 °C. The resulting proteins were then run on an SDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions, and the gel was dried (Bio-Rad gel dryer) and exposed to x-rays film. Immunofluorescence—CHO or HEK-293 cells were seeded on 14-mm coverslips and transfected with plasmids coding for either ECE-1d or SV. They were cultivated for 48 h before fixation with cold methanol for 5 min. Nonspecific binding was saturated with 10% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then incubated with the primary antibodies directed against the COOH terminus of ECE-1 in 1% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline. Secondary goat antibodies directed against rabbit IgG were coupled to AlexaFluor-555 (Molecular Probes). Nuclei were labeled using To-Pro-3 (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were mounted with Mowiol and observed with a TCS SP2 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems). Biological Activity—ECE-1 activity was measured using BK2 peptide (aminomethylcoumarin-RPPGFSAFR-dinitrophenyl) as a substrate. The proteolysis of this quenched peptide at the Ala7-Phe8 bond by ECE-1 has already been characterized (23Muller L. Barret A. Etienne E. Meidan R. Valdenaire O. Corvol P. Tougard C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 35Johnson G.D. Ahn K. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). ECE-1 activity of HEK-293 cells stably expressing ECE-1d, SV, and SV cut was assayed as described by Luciani et al. (36Luciani N. de Rocquigny H. Turcaud S. Romieu A. Roques B.P. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 813-819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Non-transfected cells served as a negative control and BAEC as a positive control (endogenous activity). Cells were grown to 80% confluence, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested. The cells were pelleted at 300 × g, re-suspended in 200 μl of ice-cold 50 mm Tris/maleate, pH 6.8, containing 1% (w/v) N-octyl glucoside (as permeabilization agent), and protease inhibitor mixture and sonicated. Following 1 h of incubation on ice, the extracts were centrifuged (15,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and the protein content of the supernatants was measured with Bio-Rad DC reagents. ECE-1 activity was assayed in white 96-well microplates in a final volume of 100 μl. Substrate (BK-2, final concentration 30 μm), and 20 μg of cellular protein extracts were incubated in Tris maleate with or without phosphoramidon (100 μm). Fluorescence was measured (λex = 330 nm; λem = 420 nm) in a multiwell plate reader fluorimeter (Varian/Cary Eclipse™ Fluorimeter, Melbourne, Australia). Blanks consisting of all reagents except either cell extract or substrate gave only negligible conversion. Fluorescence was measured at several time points for each cell type until complete hydrolysis was achieved. An incubation time of 90 min was chosen as it gave the maximal activity. Relative BK-2 breakdown was calculated by subtracting the values obtained in the presence of phosphoramidon from the total fluorescence at the corresponding time point. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from the cells using TRI Reagent. One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed, and semiquantitative PCR was performed as described previously (37Mamluk R. Chen D. Greber Y. Davis J.S. Meidan R. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 58: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The sequence of the primers used in PCR reactions is shown in TABLE ONE. Real-time PCR—The PCR reaction was performed as we described previously (33Klipper E. Gilboa T. Levy N. Kisliouk T. Spanel-Borowski K. Meidan R. Reproduction. 2004; 128: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), using the SYBR-Green I PCR kit as recommended by the manufacturer with ROX passive reference. The fold change of the target gene normalized to an endogenous reference, G3PDH, and was calculated by the following equation = 2 - ΔCt, where ΔCt = [(Ct target - Ct G3PDH)]. To compare the amplification efficiency of the primers for different ECE-1 isoforms, plasmids containing inserts of each ECE isoform, ECE-1a, ECE-1b, ECE-1c, and ECE-1d, were generated by PCR with the corresponding 5′ primers and ECE-1 common reverse primer (TABLE ONE). These constructs were electroporated into CHO cells as follows: 10 × 106 cells were electroporated by using a Gene-Pulser (370V, capacitance 960 microfarads) with 10 μg of plasmid DNA. Cells were then transferred into complete DMEM/F-12 medium and cultured for 16 and 48 h. RNA was extracted from the cells and cDNA was analyzed by real-time PCR with two sets of primers. The first primer set included isoform specific primers (TABLE ONE), the second set comprised primers amplifying the common sequence of ECE-1 and was used to normalize for the total amount of ECE-1 expressed in the transfected cells. The ratios of the expression of ECE-1a, -b, -c, and -d to that of total ECE-1 was 2.95, 0.72, 1.24, and 0.47, respectively. The results obtained were corrected for primer efficiency. Statistical Analysis—The differences between groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, employing the post hoc multiple comparisons Dunnett's test. Analysis was performed using SPSS (SPSS Inc. (Chicago, IL) Version 10.05 for Windows). Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. Abundance of the Various ECE-1 Isoforms in Bovine EC—To determine the abundance of the ECE-1 isoforms in EC we used quantitative real-time PCR with specific primers (TABLE ONE). In all the cell types examined, including macro- and microvascular EC (BAEC and luteal EC, respectively), ECE-1d was by far the most abundant type. Its expression levels were 14-25 times higher than those of the least expressed form 1a (Fig. 1). The mRNA levels of forms b and c were similarly expressed in all three cell types, but the relative expression level of 1c was higher in BAEC than in the two luteal EC types. Nevertheless in BAEC as in other cell types, the levels of isoform 1d expression were four to eight times as high as those in isoforms c and b, respectively (Fig. 1). Identification and Occurrence of the Spliced ECE-1 Forms of mRNA—PCR of cDNA derived from several EC types; BAEC and luteal EC with a 5′ primer specific for each ECE-1 isoform and a common reverse primer located ∼500 bp downstream (TABLE ONE) generated two products for isoforms b, c, and d (Fig. 2). The upper bands were of the expected size and the lower ones appeared ∼140 bp shorter. The existence of these two PCR products was also observed when other 3′ primers of ECE-1 were used (data not shown). The upper and lower bands were excised, cloned, and sequenced. The upper bands were the expected PCR products based on the known sequences of bECE-1 b-d (38Barker S. Khan N.Q. Wood E.G. Corder R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and the lower bands were SVs lacking the same 142-bp sequence, corresponding to exon 3′ found in all known ECE-1 isoforms (Ref. 18Valdenaire O. Rohrbacher E. Mattei M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29794-29798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar; Fig. 3A). This region in isoform ECE-1d is highlighted (in Fig. 3B). No such splice variant (lacking exon 3′) was observed for ECE-1a isoform whose transcription begins further downstream, in exon 3. Similar shorter spliced variants were also detected in human umbilical vein EC (data not shown).FIGURE 3A schematic representation of ECE-1 gene structure and its mRNA. A, ECE-1 gene structure showing the first alternative (1c, 1b, 2, 3) exons and their promoters (p). Exons 4-19, common to all isoforms and encoding the major part of ECE-1 cDNA, are not represented at the same scale. Exons are numbered according to Valdenaire et al. (20Valdenaire O. Barret A. Schweizer A. Rohrbacher E. Mongiat F. Pinet F. Corvol P. Tougard C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3115-3125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

For that we designed primers that spanned a unique sequence of SV forms (produced by the end of exon 2′ merged with exon 4; Fig. 3A). This primer (with a reverse primer spanning the region between 333 and 352 in the SV sequence of ECE-1d; TABLE ONE) should amplify all three SV forms. Full-length ECE-1"

Unlike the cytoplasmic forms, the cpSRP lacks RNA but contains a conserved 54-kDa GTPase and a novel 43-kDa subunit (cpSRP43). Recently, three functionally distinct chromodomains (CDs) have been identified in cpSRP43. In the present study, we report the three-dimensional solution structures of the three CDs (CD1, CD2, and CD3) using a variety of triple resonance NMR experiments. The structure of CD1 consists of a triple-stranded β-sheet segment. The C-terminal helical segment typically found in the nuclear chromodomains is absent in CD1. The secondary structural elements in CD2 and CD3 include a triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a C-terminal helix. Interestingly, the orientation of the C-terminal helix is significantly different in the structures of CD2 and CD3. Critical comparison of the structures of the chromodomains of cpSRP43 with those found in nuclear chromodomain proteins revealed that the diverse protein-protein interactions mediated by the CDs appear to stem from the differences that exist in the surface charge potentials of each CD.

Chloroplasts are the site of photosynthesis and various other important metabolic processes. Most of the proteins required for the function and maintenance of the chloroplasts are encoded in the nucleus, synthesized in the cytoplasm, and imported into the stroma by general import machinery (1Schnell D.J.

It lacks RNA and contains a novel 43-kDa subunit that interacts with its substrates post-translationally. CpSRP is a heterodimer consisting of a 54-kDa subunit and a 43-kDa subunit (7Groves M.R.

Ankyrin repeats are a stable modular domain (of ∼33 amino acids) scaffold that are tailored for molecular interaction. Ankyrin repeats have a well defined structure and canonical helix-loop-helix β-hairpin-loop folds (13Mosavi L.K. Cammett T.J. Desrosiers D.C. Peng Z.

The chromodomains (CDs) are a family of highly conserved structural motifs that were discovered in the Drosophila poly-comb gene-silencing proteins. Two closely spaced CDs are found at the C-terminal end of cpSRP43 (Fig. 1) (9Jonas-Straube E. Hutin C. Hoffman N.E. Schuenemann D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 43077-43084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), employing GST-fused or CD deletion constructs, showed that CD2 alone contributes to the binding of cpSRP54. Deletion of CD3 was shown to have no impact on cpSRP43 binding to cpSRP54 either/or on LHCP integration into the thylakoid membranes (10Goforth R.L. Peterson E.C. Yuan J. Moore M.J. Kight A.D. Lohse M.B. Sakon J. Henry R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43077-43084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this context, we examined the binding affinity of cpSRP43 using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Results of ITC experiments reveal that cpSRP54 binds to CD2 but not to the other two CDs (CD1 and CD3) in cpSRP43. In addition, we have solved the three-dimensional structures of the three CDs in cpSRP43 at high resolution, using multidimensional NMR techniques. The overall architecture of the CDs in the cpSRP43 subunit and CDs found in nuclear chromoproteins is similar. However, the distribution of surface charges in the structures of the CDs derived from various chromoproteins is significantly different, potentially lending insight into the functional roles of individual CDs of cpSRP43.MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression and Purification of CD1, CD2, and CD3—Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with the expression vector pGEX 4T2 encoding the cDNA sequence of individual CDs (CD1, CD2, and CD3) of cpSRP43 and grown at 37 °C in diluted 1-liter cultures of Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (Amersco). Protein expression was induced at an A600 of 0.50 with 1 mm isopropyl thiogalactoside, and the cells were incubated for an additional 4 h. Cultures were then harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 25 ml of resuspension buffer (10 mm phosphate buffer, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma)) and lysed by sonication. The expression of the GST fusion proteins (GST-CD1, GST-CD2, GST-CD3) was checked by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue.GST-fused CDs were purified from bacterial lysates by affinity chromatography using GST-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). GST-fused CDs were eluted with 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 5 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma). The affinity tag (GST) was removed by cleavage with thrombin (Sigma), and the CDs were purified on a GST-Sepharose column using 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 100 mm NaCl. The authenticity of the purified samples was checked by SDS-PAGE and electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy.Preparation of Isotope (15N or 15N/13C)-enriched CD Samples—Uniformly 15N-labeled CDs were prepared by growing E. coli in M9 medium containing 0.5 g/liter 15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Labs, 15N >98%) as the sole source of nitrogen (pH 6.8). 13C and 15N doubly labeled CD samples were prepared in M9 medium containing 4 g/liter [13C]glucose (Cambridge Isotope Labs, 13C >98%) and 0.5 g of 15NH4Cl as the sole sources of carbon and nitrogen, respectively. The expression and purification protocols for the isotope-labeled CD samples were the same as those used for the unlabeled samples.Circular Dichroism Measurements—Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Jasco J 720 spectropolarimeter with a cuvette of 0.1-cm path length. The scan speed was 20 nm/min, the bandwidth 1.0 nm, and the response time was 1 s. The protein concentration used was 0.5 mg/ml in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 100 mm NaCl. All circular dichroism measurements were made at 25 °C.Isothermal Titration Calorimetry Measurements—Titration calorimetry measurements were performed using a Microcal VP titration calorimeter (Northampton, MA). Samples were centrifuged prior to the titration and were examined for precipitates, if any, after the titration. A typical titration consisted of injecting 5–10-μl aliquots of 1 mm ligand (CD) solutions into 0.25–0.3 mm cpSRP54 domain solution every 3.5 min to ensure that the titration peak returned to the base line prior to the next injection. Aliquots of ligand solutions were also injected into the reaction buffer (100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 100 mm NaCl) to measure the heats of dilution of the ligand.NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR measurements were performed on a Bruker AVANCE DMX-700 MHz spectrometer at 25 °C. A 5-mm triple resonance inverse cryoprobe with z axis field gradient was used. Samples for NMR measurements were prepared by dissolving the proteins (∼0.5 mm) in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.8 containing 100 mm NaCl) prepared in 90% H2O and 10% D2O. Two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra were acquired with the pulse sequence of phase-sensitive echo/antiecho TPP1 gradient selection (15Keeler J. Clowes R.T. Davis A.L. Laue E.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 145-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The sequential backbone assignments were made using standard three-dimensional triple-resonance HNCO (16Kay L.E. Xu G.Y. Yamazaki T. J. Magn. Reson. A. 1994; 109: 129-133Crossref Scopus (416) Google Scholar), HNCA (17Glore G.M. Grononborn A.M.

Grzesiek S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 131-138Crossref Scopus (787) Google Scholar) experiments. Side-chain resonances were assigned using two-dimensional 1H TOCSY and three-dimensional 15N TOCSY-HSQC experiments. NOE-derived distance restraints were obtained from two-dimensional 1H-NOESY and three-dimensional 15N NOESY-HSQC experiments, with a mixing time of 250 ms. The 3J(HN,Hα) coupling constants were measured from a three-dimensional HNHA spectrum (21Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). 1H and 13C chemical shifts were referenced to tetramethylsilyl propionate (sodium salt, TSP-d4) at 0 ppm, and 15N resonances were referenced indirectly (22Wishart D.S.

All NMR spectra were processed using the XWINNMR and Sparky (23Godderd T.D. Kneller D.G. Sparky3. University of California, San Francisco1968Google Scholar) software.Structure Calculations—Structures of the CDs were calculated by a distance geometry-simulated annealing protocol using crystallography NMR software (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kuntsleve R.W Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simenson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar). Distance restraints obtained by converting NOE peak intensities into distance upper limits with d(strong) = 3 Å, d(medium) = 4.0 Å, and d(weak) = 5.0 Å. A total of 100 random structures were calculated and subjected to energy minimization. The 20 lowest energy structures for each CD were selected to represent the three-dimensional folds. Structural quality was analyzed using PROCHECK-NMR (25Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4329) Google Scholar). Graphical images were prepared with MOLMOL (26Koradi R. Billetier M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6469) Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSecondary Structure of the CDs of cpSRP43The CDs of cpSRP43 are ∼50 amino acids long (Fig. 1). The average secondary structures of the three cpSRP43 CDs were determined using far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy. The far-UV circular dichroism spectrum of CD1 shows a positive ellipticity band centered at 228 nm and negative ellipticity extrema near 205 nm (data not shown). These spectral features are characteristic of proteins with β-barrel architecture (27Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 383: 318-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the structure of CD1 does not appear to contain a helical segment(s) that is typical of CDs derived from nuclear chromoproteins. The far-UV circular dichroism spectra of both CD2 and CD3 show negative ellipticity bands near 208 and 222 nm suggesting that portions of the backbone of these domains are in helical conformation(s) (data not shown).Assignment of Resonances and Identification of Secondary Structure Elements in CDs of cpSRP43Resonance assignments in CD1, CD2, and CD3 were achieved using a variety of triple resonance experiments. 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the CDs of cpSRP43 are well dispersed suggesting that these domains are structured (Fig. 2). Assignments of the chemical shifts of 1H, 13C, and 15N nuclei in the backbone of proteins were made using a combination of three-dimensional HNCA (17Glore G.M. Grononborn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), HN(CO)CA (18Bax A. Ikura M. J. Biomol.

Muller L. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1993; 101: 201-205Crossref Scopus (847) Google Scholar) experiments. Aliphatic side-chain proton resonances were assigned using two-dimensional 1H-TOCSY and three-dimensional 15N HSQC-TOCSY data. Long and medium range distance constraints were derived from two-dimensional 1H-NOESY and three-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC-NOESY experiments. The elements of secondary structure in the three CDs were determined from the 1Hα, 13Cα, 13Cβ, and 13CO chemical shifts, patterns of short and medium range inter-residue NOEs and 3JαNH couplings. Secondary structure elements in CD2 and CD3 include a triple-stranded β-sheet and an α-helix. Interestingly, CD1 lacks helical segments and only contains a triple-stranded β-sheet segment.FIGURE 21H-15N HSQC spectra of CDs from cpSRP43.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Quality of the Three-dimensional Structure of the CDs of cpSRP43The three-dimensional structures of the CDs were computed based on the distance geometry calculation and energy minimization. Ensembles of 20 structures were calculated for each of the CDs. The average NMR structure represents a good fit of the experimental data, with very small residual constraint violations (<0.1 Å for distance constraints and >1 Å for the dihedral angle constraints). A summary of the structural statistics for the final 20 structures of each CD is listed in TABLE ONE. The high quality of the three chromodomain structures is evident from the results of PROCHECK analysis, which reveals that the majority of the residues are in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot.TABLE ONEStructural statistics for chromodomains of cpSRP43CD1CD2CD3 CNSaCNS, crystallography NMR software energies (kcal mol–1)bNo NOE distance and dihedral angle restraints was violated by more than 1 ÅEtot–486 ± 9.2–762 ± 9.7–755 ± 10.2Ebond35 ± 5.639 ± 9.530 ± 4.1Eimpr70 ± 5.834 ± 9.129 ± 5.5Evdw67 ± 8.983 ± 9.220 ± 2.3r.m.s.cr.m.s., root mean square deviation from mean coordinatesdMean coordinates were obtained by averaging coordinates of the 20 calculated structuresBackbone all atoms (N, Cα, C′) (Å)1.13 ± 0.10.85 ± 0.11.23 ± 0.1Backbone, secondary structure (Å)0.55 ± 0.10.46 ± 0.10.54 ± 0.1All heavy atoms (Å)1.68 ± 0.11.52 ± 0.12.09 ± 0.1 Ramachandran plotResidues in favorable regionseThis reflects residues in both most favored and additionally favored regions86.9%91.2%89.1%a CNS, crystallography NMR softwareb No NOE distance and dihedral angle restraints was violated by more than 1 Åc r.m.s., root mean squared Mean coordinates were obtained by averaging coordinates of the 20 calculated structurese This reflects residues in both most favored and additionally favored regions Open table in a new tab Description of the Three-dimensional Structures of CDs of cpSRP43Three-dimensional Structure of CD1—CD1 contains the tryptophan pair (Trp25 and Trp33) that is conserved in all CDs derived from both nuclear and non-nuclear chromoproteins (14Eissenberg J.C. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 275: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Although no protein binding partners for CD1 have yet been identified, CD1 has been shown to play an important role in the integration of LHCP into the thylakoid membrane (10Goforth R.L.

Recently, Goforth et al. (10Goforth R.L. Peterson E.C. Yuan J. Moore M.J. Kight A.D. Lohse M.B. Sakon J. Henry R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43077-43084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) showed that deletion of CD1 from cpSRP43 resulted in a 4-fold increase in the rate at which GTP is hydrolyzed by cpSRP54/FtsY. Therefore, it is proposed that CD1 acts as a negative regulator of GTP hydrolysis (10Goforth R.L. Peterson E.C. Yuan J. Moore M.J. Kight A.D. Lohse M.B. Sakon J. Henry R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43077-43084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).The solution structure of CD1 shows three antiparallel β-strands (strand I, residues 10–14; strand II, residues 18–22; and strand III, residues 32–35) organized to form a triple-stranded β-barrel structure. The C-terminal α-helix, which is a characteristic feature of CD structures, is conspicuously absent in CD1 (Fig. 3). These observations are consistent with the far-UV circular dichroism data. In this context, it would be interesting to note that recently a putative nuclear CD from MOF, a member of the histone acetylating transferase from Drosophila, has been shown to have a β-barrel structure without the C-terminal helix conventionally found in the structures of CDs (28Nielsen P.R. Nietlispach D. Buscaino A. Warner R.J. Akhtar A. Murzin A.G. Murzina N.V. Laue E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32326-32331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Hydrogenbonding interactions between residues located in β-strands I and III (Thr13-NH, strand I) to Val34-CO (strand III) and Val34-NH (strand III) to Ser11 (strand I) stabilize the β-barrel structure of CD1. Similarly, a hydrogen bond between the amide proton of Asp27 and the carbonyl group of Val6 links the flexible N-terminal end with residues located in the loop region situated between strands II and III (Fig. 3). Several long range NOEs from the indole ring of Trp25 could be detected in the two-dimensional 1H-NOESY and three-dimensional 15N HSQC-NOESY spectra of CD1. These long range interactions aid in the positioning of the indole ring in the central core of the CD1 molecule. The structure of CD1 is characterized by large clusters of hydrophobic residues (Fig. 4). Isolated charged residues are located at the periphery of the hydrophobic core. The large areas of non-polar surfaces found in CD1 may be important for its negative regulatory role on the cpSRP54/cpFTSY-mediated GTPase activity (10Goforth R.L. Peterson E.C. Yuan J. Moore M.J. Kight A.D. Lohse M.B. Sakon J. Henry R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43077-43084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Non-polar surfaces in CD1 might help in the exclusion of water from the GTP-binding site in SRP54/FtsY and consequently prevent nonproductive GTP hydrolysis.FIGURE 3Overlap of the backbone structures of CDs of cpSRP43.

The layer bordering the hydrophobic core is comprised of positively charged residues (blue).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Three-dimensional Solution Structure of CD2—The solution structure of CD2 has been determined at high resolution (TABLE ONE). The secondary structural elements in the protein include three β-strands (strand I, residues 14–18; strand II, residues 22–26; and strand III, residues 36–39) and a C-terminal α-helix (residues 44–56). The α-helix in CD2 is positioned perpendicular to the plane of the triple-stranded, antiparallel β-sheet (Fig. 3). This structural feature is also shared by CDs from nuclear chromoproteins. The structure of CD2 is characterized by two β-bulges located at Asp11 and Leu26. The presence of β-bulge structures in CD2 is reflected by the torsional angles of Asp11 and Leu26 in the Ramachandran plot. Interestingly, all CD structures are characterized by the presence of β-bulge structures, and this aspect possibly reflects their evolution from a common ancestral gene. The β-bulge at Asp11 facilitates long range interactions of the amide proton of Glu15 (in β-strand I) with residues in the α-helix segment. Similarly, the β-bulge located at Leu26 aids in the accommodation of the large indole ring of Trp29 within β-strand II. There are strong NOEs in the two-dimensional 1H-NOESY and three-dimensional 15N HSQC-NOESY spectra that define the interactions of the C-terminal helical segment with other portions of the structure of CD2. These interactions include the α-proton of Glu56 with the amide proton of Val4, the amide proton of Tyr51 with the indole ring proton of Trp29, and the α-proton of Tyr51 with the amide proton of Glu15. These long range interactions are primarily responsible for the perpendicular alignment of the C-terminal helix with the plane of the triple-stranded β-sheet segment. An indirect structural consequence of the occurrence of the two β-bulges in CD2 is the formation of two distinct hydrophobic clusters that are enclosed between the α-helix and β-strand I (Fig. 4). Such hydrophobic cores have been shown to be protein-protein interaction sites in CDs of nuclear chromoproteins (29Baumann H. Knapp S. Karshikoff A. Ladenstein R. Hard T. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 30Nielsen P.R. Nietlispach D. Mott H.R. Callaghen J. Bannuster A. Kouzarides T. Murzin A.G. Murzina N. Laue E.D. Nature. 2002; 416: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The two non-polar clusters are organized around each of the conserved tryptophan residues (Trp29 and Trp37). Cluster-1 is formed by non-polar residues (Val23, Tyr25, Leu26, and Val27) surrounding Trp29. The other isolated hydrophobic core consists of Trp37, Val38, Val41, and Ala42. The hydrophobic cluster built around Trp29 shows an interesting arrangement. This cluster is enclosed by two layers of charged residues (Fig. 4). A layer of positively charged residues consisting of Lys16, Arg17, Lys19, and Lys21 border the hydrophobic cluster-1. The layer of cationic residues is surrounded by large areas occupied by negatively charged residues. This unique structural architecture could be important for interactions of CD2 with cpSRP54, and it is not observed in the structures of CD1 and CD3 (Fig. 4). In addition, the structure of CD2 is characterized by a high negative surface charge potential.Structure of the CD3 Domain—The three-dimensional solution structure of CD3 is characterized by the presence of three antiparallel β-strands (Fig. 3) (strand I, residues 4–9; strand II, residues 20–25; and strand III, residues 29–33) and a C-terminal α-helix (residues 40–50). Unlike CD2, the axis of the α-helix in CD3 is para"

These repressors are known to bind the C-terminal binding protein corepressor, but their mechanism of action is poorly understood. We purified functional recombinant Knirps protein from transgenic embryos to identify possible cofactors that contribute to the activity of this protein. The protein migrates in a complex of ∼450 kDa and was found to copurify with the Rpd3 histone deacetylase protein during a double affinity purification procedure. Association of Rpd3 with Knirps was dependent on the presence of the C-terminal binding protein-dependent repression domain of Knirps. Previous studies of an rpd3 mutant had not shown defects in the pattern of expression of even-skipped, a target of the Knirps repressor. However, in embryos doubly heterozygous for knirps and rpd3, a marked increase in the frequency of defects in the Knirps-regulated posterior domain of even-skipped expression was found, indicating that Rpd3 contributes to Knirps repression activity in vivo. This finding implicates deacetylation in the mechanism of short range repression in Drosophila.

Transcriptional repression is critical for the patterned expression of developmentally regulated genes in Drosophila and other metazoans. Transcriptional repressors can exhibit a range of effects; repression can be transient or persist over long periods of time, and repressors can work locally (short range) or influence the activity of cis regulatory elements over 1 kbp away (long range). Repressors act through multiple biochemical pathways, including interference with activation domains, remodeling of chromatin, and direct interactions with the basal transcriptional machinery (1Arnosti D.N.

One of the best characterized systems of developmental gene regulation involving transcriptional repressors is that present in the Drosophila blastoderm embryo, where repressors encoded by “gap genes” control the presegmental expression of pair rule genes, including even-skipped (eve). This pair rule gene is controlled by five modular enhancers present 5′ and 3′ of the transcription unit, each of which is regulated by short range repressors, including Giant, Krüppel, and Knirps (4Fujioka M.

CtBP is a widely conserved dimeric corepressor that interacts with a variety of transcription factors, recognizing a short peptide motif (PMDLS in Knirps) in the binding partner (reviewed in Ref. 13Chinnadurai G. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). CtBP proteins bear striking similarities to α-hydroxy acid dehydrogenases and like these enzymes bind to NAD/NADH (14Kumar V.

Binding of the cofactor has been observed to stimulate dimer or higher order complex formation in vitro and has been suggested to function as a metabolic switch in vivo, allowing cells to tune patterns of gene expression to nuclear levels of NADH (16Zhang Q. Piston D.W. Goodman R.H. Science. 2002; 295: 1895-1897PubMed Google Scholar). Loss of NADH binding through mutagenesis of conserved glycines of the dinucleotide binding cleft compromises repression activity by this protein, preventing dimerization, and interaction with target transcription factors (10Sutrias-Grau M.

In addition, residues important for enzymatic function in the related dehydrogenases are conserved in metazoan CtBP proteins, although the possible enzymatic function of CtBP is poorly understood. Two reports find a weak dehydrogenase activity associated with the protein, but the conserved histidine residue of the catalytic triad is not required for transcriptional repression in vivo (10Sutrias-Grau M. Arnosti D.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5953-5966Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 14Kumar V. Carlson J.E. Ohgi K.A. Edwards T.A. Rose D.W. Escalante C.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Aggarwal A.K. Mol.

Mammalian CtBP physically associates with a variety of chromatin-modifying proteins, including histone deacetylases, histone methyltransferases, and a polyamine oxidase that was recently found to mediate lysine demethylation (18Shi Y. Sawada J. Sui G. Affar el B. Whetstine J.R. Lan F. Ogawa H. Luke M.P. Nakatani Y. Shi Y. Nature. 2003; 422: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 19Shi Y. Lan F. Matson C. Mulligan P.

These associated factors may be the main mediators of the repression activity for CtBP, although how a particular suite of CtBP associated activities may combine to regulate gene expression on endogenous circuits is not currently understood. The physiological role of one CtBP-associated histone deacetylase enzyme, HDAC1 (also termed Rpd3 in yeast and Drosophila), has been extensively characterized with respect to gene regulation. In addition to association with CtBP, Rpd3 proteins have been found in complexes that include the Sin3, Sds3, SAP18, and SAP30 proteins (20Kasten M.M. Dorland S. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell.

As a complex or individually, Rpd3/HDAC1 proteins are recruited to promoters to mediate repression by a variety of DNA-binding transcription factors, including Ume6 in yeast and YY1 and Mad/Max in mammals (24Kadosh D. Struhl K. Cell. 1997; 89: 365-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 25Yang W.M. Inouye C. Zeng Y. Bearss D. Seto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In yeast and in metazoans, rpd3 mutants show defects in transcriptional regulation of cell cycle genes and firing of the origins of replication (35Aggarwal B.D. Calvi B.R. Nature. 2004; 430: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 36Vogelauer M. Rubbi L. Lucas I. Brewer B.J. Grunstein M. Mol.

The Rpd3 protein can deacetylate histone H4 and H3 in vitro, and in mutant backgrounds increases in histone H3 and H4 acetylation is observed (38Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Suka N. Turner B.M. Grunstein M. Nature. 1998; 392: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 39Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Kobayashi R. Bavykin S. Turner B.M. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The extent of histone deacetylation in yeast appears to be very local, extending over a range of 1-2 nucleosomes (41Kadosh D. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5121-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Rpd3 has also been suggested to function positively, suppressing the repressive effects of heterochromatin and in certain cases directly activating the transcription of specific genes, although in most cases this regulation is thought to be indirect (42de Nadal E. Zapater M. Alepuz P.M. Sumoy L. Mas G. Posas F. Nature. 2004; 427: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 43De Rubertis F. Kadosh D. Henchoz S. Pauli D.

Cell. 2004; 16: 199-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Unlike the nonlethal phenotype observed in yeast, homozygous null rpd3 mutations in Drosophila are lethal in the larval stage (45Mottus R. Sobel R.E. Grigliatti T.A. Genetics. 2000; 154: 657-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many aspects of pair rule gene regulation in the embryo that are under the control of gap repressor proteins such as Knirps are not affected by loss of Rpd3. This finding prompted Mannervik and Levine (46Mannervik M. Levine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6797-6801Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) to suggest that these short range repressors do not require Rpd3 for their activity. However, Rpd3 has been linked to a number of repressors active in the Drosophila embryo. Loss of rpd3 activity is observed to lead to misregulation of ftz and odd, genes regulated by the Even-skipped repressor, suggesting that Rpd3 might serve as a cofactor for Eve (46Mannervik M. Levine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6797-6801Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition, the Runt repressor requires Rpd3 for repression of the engrailed gene during the later “maintenance” phase of repression (47Wheeler J.C. VanderZwan C. Xu X. Swantek D. Tracey W.D. Gergen J.P. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies showed that the long range repressor Hairy associates with Rpd3 through the Groucho corepressor (48Chen G. Courey A.J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Although rpd3 germ line mutants do not have the dramatic embryonic phenotypes of gro and hairy mutants, gro shows strong dosage effect interactions with rpd3, suggesting that Rpd3 protein may play a partially redundant role in the function of this cofactor (48Chen G. Courey A.J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Rpd3 is also found to copurify with a large complex containing the Polycomb group (PcG) gene products E(z) and Pcl, and misregulation in homeotic genes controlled by PcG proteins have been reported in an rpd3 mutant background (31Tie F. Prasad-Sinha J. Birve A. Rasmuson-Lestander A. Harte P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3352-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 49Chang Y.L. Peng Y.H. Pan I.C. Sun D.S. King B. Huang D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9730-9735Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These lines of evidence indicate that Rpd3 plays central roles in a number of repression activities in the Drosophila embryo. Work from our laboratory has underscored the role of multiple repression activities that Knirps and other short range repressors deploy in specific developmental settings (7Keller S.A. Mao Y. Struffi P. Margulies C. Yurk C.E. Anderson A.R. Amey R.L. Moore S. Ebels J.M. Foley K. Corado M. Arnosti D.N. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2001; 239: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These repression activities respond to a complex cis regulatory grammar relating to binding site number, affinity, and arrangement that dictates how a repressor functions in specific contexts (12Clyde D.E. Corado M.S. Wu X. Pare A. Papatsenko D. Small S. Nature. 2003; 426: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 51Kulkarni M.M. Arnosti D.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3411-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We currently lack a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena, however. Therefore, to understand better the activity of Knirps repression, we have undertaken a biochemical and genetic study of Knirps-associated proteins, and we find contrary to previous indications that the Rpd3 protein may play an important role in mediating Knirps repression activity. Transgenic Flies Carrying Inducible, Double-tagged Knirps Genes—Details on the generation of transgenic flies expressing either full-length Knirps-(1-429) or the N-terminal, CtBP-independent repression domain of Knirps-(1-330) were reported previously (9Struffi P. Corado M. Kulkarni M. Arnosti D.N. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 2419-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Each protein is double-tagged, carrying an N-terminal hexahistidine tag and a C-terminal double FLAG tag, and is expressed under the control of the hsp70 promoter. Recombinant proteins are functional and can be expressed in embryos older than ∼2 h (see Ref. 9Struffi P. Corado M. Kulkarni M. Arnosti D.N. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 2419-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar; data not shown). To induce expression of recombinant Knirps proteins, transgenic embryos collected on apple juice plates at room temperature (22-23 °C) were incubated for 30 min at 38 °C in a 10-liter water bath to ensure rapid and even heating. After induction, embryos were immediately dechorionated and sonicated within 15 min from the end of heat shock. Western Blotting Analysis—Immunoblotting was performed using a tank transfer system (Mini Trans-Blot® Cell; 170-3930, Bio-Rad) and Immun-Blot™ PVDF membranes (162-0177, Bio-Rad). Antibody incubation was in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) supplemented with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk as blocking agent. SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (34080, Pierce) was used for detecting horseradish peroxidase (HRP) on immunoblots. FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (F3165, Sigma) was used at a 1:10,000 dilution. Rabbit polyclonal antiserum against Drosophila Rpd3 (kindly provided by D. Wassarman, University of Wisconsin) (52Pile L.A. Wassarman D.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6131-6140Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was used at 1:5,000 dilution. Rabbit polyclonal antiserum against Drosophila CtBP (dCtBP) was generated against full-length dCtBP and used at 1:20,000 dilution. To generate this antiserum, recombinant full-length, hexahistidine-tagged Drosophila CtBP (dCtBP-(1-479)) from pET15bCtBPL vector was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-Codon-Plus™ RIL competent cells (230240, Stratagene) and purified on Ni-NTA-agarose beads (30210, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. dCtBP protein (400 μg) in 0.2 ml of PBS buffer (1.9 mm NaH2PO4, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 154 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) was mixed with an equal volume of Titermax Gold adjuvant (T2684, Sigma) and injected subcutaneously at multiple sites in a New Zealand female rabbit. Two secondary boosts were performed similarly after 4 and 12 weeks. ImmunoPure® goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated antibody (31430, Pierce) was used at 1:20,000 dilution. Goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated antibody (170-6515, Bio-Rad) was used at 1:10,000 dilution. Drosophila Embryo Nuclear Extract Preparation—0-12-h-old embryos from the hskni1-429.3 line were collected on grape juice plates from two population cages. For each extraction, two 0-12-h collections (the first one stored 12 h at 13 °C) were pooled together. 20-40 g of embryos were either dechorionated and processed immediately or transferred on a 155-mm Petri dish and floated on a 38 °C water bath for 60 min. Heat-shocked embryos were recovered for 30 min at room temperature, prior to dechorionation and homogenization. Drosophila standard nuclear extracts were made according to Soeller et al. (53Soeller W.C. Poole S.J. Kornberg T. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 68-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation Experiments—200 μl of nuclear extracts (30 μg/μl of total protein) from embryos overexpressing full-length Knirps were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 4 μl (4.9 μg/μl) of α-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody or an equivalent amount of mouse IgG antibody on a rotating wheel. 1 ml of washing buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm sodium metabisulfite, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μm pepstatin A) was added, and each sample was supplemented with 10 μl of pre-equilibrated protein G-agarose beads (16-266, Upstate) and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C on a rotator. Beads were washed for four times (10 min each time) with 1 ml of washing buffer, resuspended in Laemmli buffer, and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C. λ-Protein Phosphatase Treatment—Crude embryo lysates were prepared from embryos expressing full-length Knirps (hskni1-429.3) and subjected to treatment with increasing amounts of λ-phosphatase. For each reaction, 20 μl of crude embryo lysate (280 μg of total protein) from 2- to 4-h hskni1-429.3 embryos subjected to 30 min of heat shock was incubated with 0, 20, 80, 400, or 1600 units of λ-phosphatase (P0753S, New England Biolabs) in 1× λ-phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 0.01% Brij 35) supplemented with 2 mm MnCl2, in a final volume of 50 μl. To limit the activity of endogenous phosphatases, reactions were carried out at 4 °C for 1 h. Phosphatase activity was blocked by addition of 20 mm sodium orthovanadate (S-6508, Sigma). Reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer followed immediately by incubation at 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, and recombinant Knirps was detected by Western blot using anti-FLAG M2 antibody. Double Affinity Purification of Recombinant Knirps Proteins—0-12-h embryos were collected at room temperature (22-23 °C) and heat-shocked for 30 min at 38 °C as described. 2-4 grams of dechorionated embryos were resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 10 mm imidazole, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm sodium metabisulfite, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μm pepstatin A) and sonicated using a Branson-250 Sonifier (4 cycles, 20-30 pulses/cycle, output 6, duty cycle 60%, 3 min on ice between cycles, using a medium tip). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (20 min at 27,000 × g), and 2 ml of washed and pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA-agarose beads (His Select™ HC Nickel, 6611, Sigma) were added to the supernatant. After 6 h at 4°C on a rotating wheel, beads were washed three times with 50 ml of lysis buffer supplemented with 20 mm imidazole and transferred to a 5-ml tube. Proteins were eluted twice using 3 ml of lysis buffer supplemented with 150 mm imidazole. The eluates were pooled and diluted to 50 ml with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm sodium metabisulfite, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μm pepstatin A, 1 mm PMSF. 200-300 μl of protein-G-agarose beads (16-266, Upstate) covalently coupled with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (2 mg of antibody per ml of wet beads) were added to the solution and incubated for 12-18 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Beads were washed three times with 50 ml of the same buffer and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, and proteins were eluted with 1.2 ml of buffer containing 0.2% N-lauroyl-sarkosine (L-5777, Sigma). Protein samples were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated using 4 mg/ml sodium deoxycholate (D-6750, Sigma) as carrier, resuspended in Laemmli buffer, and heated 5 min at 95 °C. For each purification experiment, one or two negative controls were used in parallel as follows: either heat-shocked, nontransgenic yellow, white67 (yw67) embryos or transgenic embryos from the hs-kni line that was not heat-shocked. Chromatographic Identification of the Knirps Complex—To determine the apparent molecular size of recombinant Knirps, whole-cell extracts from embryos expressing full-length Knirps were subjected to gel filtration chromatography. 0-12-h-old embryos from hskni1-429.3 were heat-shocked for 30 min, and a crude lysate was prepared essentially as described above, using a lysis buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm sodium metabisulfite, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μm pepstatin A, and 1 mm PMSF. Lysates were centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 20 min, and 300 μl of cleared lysate (6 mg of total protein) was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated Superdex-200 HR 10/30 column (17-1088-01, Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 1.5 volumes of lysis buffer at the flow rate of 0.4 ml/min using the ÄKTAexplorer 100 system (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and analyzed by Western blot for the presence of recombinant Knirps, CtBP, and Rpd3. The same column was loaded with size markers (MW-GF-1000, Sigma) and run using identical conditions to determine in which fractions the different markers elute. Genetic Interaction between Knirps and rpd3—To test for a genetic interaction between kni and rpd3, transheterozygous flies for kni and rpd3 were generated, and the expression pattern of the Knirps target gene eve was monitored by in situ hybridization as described previously (9Struffi P. Corado M. Kulkarni M. Arnosti D.N. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 2419-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). kni9 (Bloomington stock 3332) carries a null mutation in Knirps and was previously used to test a genetic interaction between kni and CtBP (8Nibu Y. Zhang H. Levine M. Science. 1998; 280: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). kni7G (Tübingen stock number Z334) is a loss of function mutation caused by a point mutation (C48S) in the DNA binding domain (54Gerwin N. La R.A. Sauer F. Halbritter H.P. Neumann M. Jackle H. Nauber U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 12: 7899-7908Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). rpd304556 (Bloomington stock 11633) is a strong hypomorphic mutation caused by a P-element insertion in the 5′-untranslated region of rpd3, resulting in a severe reduction in Rpd3 expression (46Mannervik M. Levine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6797-6801Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). rpd3def24 (kindly provided by S. Frankel) is a null allele caused by excision of a P-element, resulting in a deletion of ∼870 bp in rpd304556 in the 5′-coding region of the gene (45Mottus R. Sobel R.E. Grigliatti T.A. Genetics. 2000; 154: 657-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heterozygous phenotypes for each kni and rpd3 allele were noted after crossing balanced lines to a yw67 strain. Half of embryos from outcrosses to wild-type stocks are heterozygous, thus the observed frequency of eve stripe abnormalities in kni heterozygous embryos (14% for kni9 and 21% for kni7G) indicates that the penetrance is 28-42%. Expression and Phosphorylation of Recombinant Full-length Knirps in Drosoph"
https://openalex.org/W2110436782,"Vc-NhaD is a Na+/H+ antiporter from Vibrio cholerae with a sharp maximum of activity at pH ∼ 8.0. NhaD homologues are present in many bacteria as well as in higher plants. However, very little is known about structure-function relations in NhaD-type antiporters. In this work 14 conserved polar residues associated with putative transmembrane segments of Vc-NhaD have been screened for their possible role in the ion translocation and pH regulation of Vc-NhaD. Substitutions S150A, D154G, N155A, N189A, D199A, T201A, T202A, S389A, N394G, S428A, and S431A completely abolished the Vc-NhaD-mediated Na+-dependent H+ transfer in inside-out membrane vesicles. Substitutions T157A and S428A caused a significant increase of apparent Km values for alkali cations, with the Km for Li+ elevated more than that for Na+, indicating that Thr-157 and Ser-428 are involved in alkali cation binding/translocation. Of six conserved His residues, mutation of only His-93 and His-210 affected the Na+(Li+)/H+ antiport, resulting in an acidic shift of its pH profile, whereas H93A also caused a 7-fold increase of apparent Km for Na+ without affecting the Km for Li+. These data suggest that side chains of His-93 and His-210 are involved in proton binding and that His-93 also contributes to the binding of Na ions during the catalytic cycle. These 15 residues are clustered in three distinct groups, two located at opposite sides of the membrane, presumably facilitating the access of substrate ions to the third group, a putative catalytic site in the middle of lipid bilayer. The distribution of these key residues in Vc-NhaD molecule also suggests that transmembrane segments IV, V, VI, X, XI, and XII are situated close to one another, creating a transmembrane relay of charged/polar residues involved in the attraction, coordination, and translocation of transported cations. Vc-NhaD is a Na+/H+ antiporter from Vibrio cholerae with a sharp maximum of activity at pH ∼ 8.0. NhaD homologues are present in many bacteria as well as in higher plants. However, very little is known about structure-function relations in NhaD-type antiporters. In this work 14 conserved polar residues associated with putative transmembrane segments of Vc-NhaD have been screened for their possible role in the ion translocation and pH regulation of Vc-NhaD. Substitutions S150A, D154G, N155A, N189A, D199A, T201A, T202A, S389A, N394G, S428A, and S431A completely abolished the Vc-NhaD-mediated Na+-dependent H+ transfer in inside-out membrane vesicles. Substitutions T157A and S428A caused a significant increase of apparent Km values for alkali cations, with the Km for Li+ elevated more than that for Na+, indicating that Thr-157 and Ser-428 are involved in alkali cation binding/translocation.

Sodium proton antiporters are universal secondary ion transporters in bacteria. Typically, they expel toxic Na+ and Li+ ions from the cytoplasm at the expense of the proton motive force, thus playing an important role in cytoplasmic Na+ and pH homeostasis and providing energy for Na+ symports (for review, see Refs. 1Busch W.

The genome of pathogenic Vibrio cholerae encodes as many as six putative structural genes of Na+/H+ antiporters (24Heidelberg J.F. et al.Nature. 2000; 406: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). The physiological basis for such apparent redundancy could be in part explained by recent findings of additional, predominantly regulatory functions of certain bacterial Na+/H+ antiporters affecting processes such as antibiotic efflux (25Krulwich T.A. Jin J. Guffanti A.A. Bechhofer D.H. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 237-246PubMed Google Scholar), the transcription of the Pho operon (26Pragai Z. Eschevins C. Bron S. Harwood C.R. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2505-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the initiation of sporulation (27Kosono S. Ohashi Y. Kawamura F. Kitada M. Kudo T. J.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5896-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Studying Na+/H+ antiport in V. cholerae, we have cloned a new Na+/H+ antiporter from V. cholerae, Vc-NhaD, and expressed it in its functional form in the ΔNhaAΔNhaB strain of E. coli (29Dzioba J. Ostroumov E. Winogrodzki A. Dibrov P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 229: 119-124Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A distinctive feature of Vc-NhaD is its pH dependence with a sharp maximum of activity at pH ∼ 8.0 (29Dzioba J. Ostroumov E. Winogrodzki A. Dibrov P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 229: 119-124Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 30Ostroumov E. Dzioba J. Loewen P.C. Dibrov P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1564: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This distinguishes Vc-NhaD from other major enterobacterial antiporters. Indeed, Ec-NhaB from E. coli is pH-independent, whereas the activity of Ec-NhaA gradually increases upon pH shift from 7.0 to 8.0, reaching a plateau (9Taglicht D. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11289-11294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Curiously, homologous NhaD from Vibrio parahaemolyticus exhibits pH dependence similar to Ec-NhaA rather than Vc-NhaD (31Nozaki K. Kuroda T. Mizushima T. Tsuchiya T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1369: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The Na+/H+ antiporters of NhaD type are widely distributed in nature, being found in genomes of pathogenic vibrios, nitrogen-fixing symbionts, magnetotactic cocci and photosynthetic bacteria as well as in higher plants (Fig. 1). In obligate intracellular parasites of Chlamydia genus, NhaD serves as a sole Na+/H+ antiporter (32Häse C. Fedorova N. Galperin M.Y. Dibrov P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 353-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 33Dibrov P. Dibrov E. Pierce G.N. Galperin M.Y. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2004; 8: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms of cation exchange mediated by these proteins. In the absence of a detailed crystal structure, identification of functionally important residues in antiporters by site-directed mutagenesis remains one of the most informative approaches. Because Na+/H+ antiporters are exchanging cations, negatively charged residues are obvious primary targets for mutagenesis (see for example Refs. 18Inoue H. Noumi T. Tsuchiya T. Kanazawa H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar and 23Tzuberi T. Rimon A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3265-3272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In our previous work we found that mutation of three polar residues, Asp-344, Thr-345 (TMS 3The abbreviations used are:TMStransmembrane segmentEc-NhaA and Ec-NhaBNa+/H+ antiporters of NhaA type and NhaB type from E. coli, respectivelyVc-NhaDNa+/H+ antiporter of NhaD type from V. choleraeΔpHpH difference across the membranePBSphosphate-buffered saline X and loop IX-X), and Asp-393 (within TMS XI) severely affects the Na+-dependent proton transfer mediated by Vc-NhaD (30Ostroumov E. Dzioba J. Loewen P.C. Dibrov P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1564: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the present study we extended these observations by mutating Vc-NhaD residues that are conserved in NhaD homologues from different organisms (see Fig. 1). In particular, the following questions were addressed. (i) Are polar residues Ser-389, Ser-390, and Asn-394 surrounding Asp-393 in TMS XI functionally important as well? (ii) Do the distant conserved polar residues associated with TMS V and VI (Asp-154, Thr-157, Asp-199, Thr-201, Thr-202) affect the function of Vc-NhaD? (iii) Are any of the conserved His residues involved in the pH response of Vc-NhaD, such as His-225 in Ec-NhaA (15Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Rimon A. Taglicht D. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 16Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Schuldiner S. Padan E. J. Biol.

(iv) How would the substitution of all Cys residues by serines affect the activity? transmembrane segment Na+/H+ antiporters of NhaA type and NhaB type from E. coli, respectively Na+/H+ antiporter of NhaD type from V. cholerae pH difference across the membrane phosphate-buffered saline Here we report the identification of three distinct clusters of functionally important polar residues dispersed through the protein. Cluster 1 is associated with TMS IV-VI at the periplasmic side of the protein, cluster 2 is at the opposite side facing cytoplasm (TMS X), and cluster 3 in TMS XI-XII is located in the middle of the transmembrane segments. Together with residues His-93 and His-210, which control the pH profile of the antiport and its affinity to alkali cations, these clusters may form a transmembrane relay of charged/polar residues involved in the attraction, coordination, and translocation of transported ions in a striking similarity to the recently reported structure of phylogenetically distant Ec-NhaA (22Hunte C. Screpanti E. Venturi M. Rimon A. Padan E. Michel H. Nature. 2005; 435: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Materials—All chemicals were from Fisher or Sigma. Restriction nucleases were from Invitrogen, MBI Fermentas, or New England Biolabs. Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—The Na+/H+ antiporter-deficient (melBLid, ΔNhaB1, camR, ΔNhaA1, kanR, ΔlacZY, thr1) strain of E. coli, EP432 was kindly provided by Dr. E. Padan (Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel). For routine cloning and plasmid construction, DH5α (United States Biochemical Corp.) was used as the host. If not indicated otherwise, cells were grown aerobically at 37 °C in modified L broth (LBK) in which NaCl was replaced by KCl (7Padan E. Maisler N. Taglicht D. Karpel R. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20297-20302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All transformants were grown in media supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as recommended by the manufacturer. The mutagenic oligonucleotide primers were designed to create or remove specific restriction enzyme sites (listed in the supplemental table). As a template for mutagenesis, the plasmid pBLDL (pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene) containing the nhaD gene together with the 300-bp-long 5′- and 230-bp-long 3′-flanking sequences as a 1837-bp EcoRI-BamHI insert) was used (29Dzioba J. Ostroumov E. Winogrodzki A. Dibrov P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 229: 119-124Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mutated plasmid DNA was isolated from selected transformant clones and digested by appropriate restriction enzymes to check for the presence of desired mutation. The minimal nhaD fragments containing the target mutation were then excised and used to replace the respective sequences in the original (non-mutated) pBLDL. Fidelity of all final mutated versions of nhaD in pBLDL was verified by DNA sequencing. Isolation of Membrane Vesicles and Assay of Na+/H+Antiport Activity—Inside-out membrane vesicles were obtained by passing a bacterial suspension through a French press (Aminco) and assayed for Na+/H+ antiport activity as described previously (29Dzioba J. Ostroumov E. Winogrodzki A. Dibrov P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 229: 119-124Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 30Ostroumov E. Dzioba J. Loewen P.C. Dibrov P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1564: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Protein content in membrane vesicles was determined by the Bio-Rad detergent compatible protein assay kit. The Na+/H+ antiporter activity was registered by the acridine orange fluorescence dequenching. Aliquots of vesicles (200 μg of protein) were resuspended in 2 ml of a medium containing 100 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm MgSO4, 0.5 μm acridine orange, and 50 mm Hepes-Tris buffer adjusted to the indicated pH. Respiration-dependent formation of the ΔpH was initiated by the addition of 10 mm Tris-d-lactate, and the resulting quenching of acridine orange fluorescence was monitored with the Shimadzu RF-1501 spectrofluorophotometer (excitation at 492 nm and emission at 528 nm). Na+/H+ antiporter activity was estimated based on its ability to dissipate the established ΔpH upon the addition of the indicated concentrations of NaCl or LiCl (10 mm in the pH-profile determination; 0.5-50 mm for the determination of half-maximal effective concentration). The antiport activities are expressed as percent restoration of the lactate-induced fluorescence quenching. In Silico Analysis of Vc-NhaD—NhaD homologues in various organisms were identified through a BLASTP (34Altschul S. Madden T. Schaffer A. Zhang J. Zheng Z. Miller W. Lipman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar) search against the NCBI (Bethesda, MD) nonredundant protein database. A partial alignment showing the conserved polar residues located within or associated with putative transmembrane segments as well as conserved His and Cys residues is shown in Fig. 1. Putative membrane topology model of NhaD from V. cholerae (Fig. 1B) was constructed using the Topopredict II (35Claros M. von Heijne G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 685-686PubMed Google Scholar) and HMMTOP (36Tusnády G.E. Simon I. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar) programs. The three-dimensional diagram showing the recently reported structure of Ec-NhaA (22Hunte C. Screpanti E. Venturi M. Rimon A. Padan E. Michel H. Nature. 2005; 435: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) in relation to the functionally important residues of Vc-NhaD was prepared using VMD (44Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39018) Google Scholar). Immunodetection of Vc-NhaD in Membranes—Polyclonal anti-NhaD antibodies were produced by Genemed Synthesis, Inc. against the following peptide from a putative IX-X loop of Vc-NhaD: 316AKNDEAALKRIGSVVPFDVFRSISHAC342 (with C-terminal cysteine added for coupling). The antibodies were further affinity-purified on the column containing the above peptide coupled to SulfoLink coupling gel (Pierce). The procedure recommended by the manufacturer was followed with a minor modification; the antibodies were eluted in 0.5-ml fractions into Eppendorf tubes containing 50 μl of glycerol and 50 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to prevent antibody precipitation. To deplete proteins loosely bound to the membranes, aliquots of membrane vesicles containing 100 μg of total membrane protein were carbonate-extracted by the incubation on ice for 15 min in 200 μl of 0.1 m sodium carbonate. The samples were then pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 rpm in TLA100.3 Beckman rotor for 30 min. The membrane pellets were re-suspended in 200 μl of a standard SDS-PAGE loading buffer each and incubated at 42 °C for 30 min with shaking. For electrophoresis, 20 μl of sample was loaded per lane. Proteins were resolved in 12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride Western blotting membrane (Roche Applied Science). The membranes were blocked at room temperature with 10% skim milk powder dissolved in PBS with 1% Tween 20 (Sigma) (PBST) for 30 min. Then the membrane was incubated with the affinity-purified anti-NhaD antibodies at a dilution of 1:3000 in 2% skim milk powder dissolved in PBST. The blot was rinsed 5 times for 5 min each with PBST and incubated for 30 min with goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) at a dilution of 1:3000 in 2% skim milk powder dissolved in PBST. The blot was rinsed 5 times for 5 min each with PBST. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the Amersham enhanced chemiluminescence kit as recommended by the manufacturer. A Fluoro Chem™ 8900 was used to detect the resulting signal. Strategy of Mutagenesis—Fig. 1A illustrates the strategy adopted for choosing the target amino acids for mutagenesis. It shows partial alignments of representative NhaD-like proteins from different organisms. Sequences presented in Fig. 1A may be divided into three subgroups, with proteins within subgroups sharing higher degrees of identity/similarity. The largest one includes NhaD-like proteins from bacteria that are free-living or have a free-living stage in their life cycle (Subgroup 1, last seven rows in Fig. 1A). Chlamydial proteins (from obligate intracellular parasites, rows three and four in Fig. 1) comprise the second subgroup (Subgroup 2). The third subgroup includes NhaD from nitrogen-fixing symbiont Bradyrhizobium japonicum and higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Thirteen polar/charged residues are conserved in all aligned sequences (highlighted and marked by asterisks in Fig. 1). In Vc-NhaD these residues are Ser-150, Asp-154, Asn-155, Thr-157, Asn-189, Asp-199, Thr-201, Thr-202, Ser-389, Asp-393, Asn-394, Ser-425, and Ser-431. From this list we had previously mutagenized Asp-393 (30Ostroumov E. Dzioba J. Loewen P.C. Dibrov P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1564: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) in a study that also included Glu-100, Glu-342, Asp-344, and Thr-345, which are conserved in antiporters belonging to Subgroup 1 as well as the weakly conserved Glu-251. The remaining residues were investigated in this study. Routinely, a target residue was changed into Ala, except Asp-154 and Asn-394, which were changed into Gly. Because our aim was to eliminate charged side chains in chosen positions, either substitution seemed appropriate. Choice of Gly in two mentioned cases just simplified the screening of mutant clones by restriction analysis. In addition to the fully conserved residues, six His residues, His-93, His-210, His-274, His-278, His-450, and His-468, are conserved at least partially in proteins belonging to Subgroup 1 (Fig. 1A). They could have a role in determining the pH response of the antiporter because of their physiologically relevant pKa. Indeed, mutation of conserved His-225 in Ec-NhaA alters the pH response of the antiporter (15Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Rimon A. Taglicht D. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 16Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Schuldiner S. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26813-26817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Finally, Vc-NhaD has only three Cys residues, Cys-163, Cys-181, and Cys-355, which are all conserved in Subgroup 1 (Fig. 1A). Because the Cys-less variant of Ec-NhaA is nearly as active as wild type protein (17Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1761-1768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 21Rimon A. Tzubery T. Galili L. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14897-14905Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the Cys residues of Vc-NhaD were also targeted for analysis. Cys-less Variant of Vc-NhaD Retains Normal Activity—After insertion of the C163S, C181S, and C355S mutations into nhaD gene, the mutated gene on the plasmid pTM was introduced into the Na+/H+ antiport-deficient EP432 cells of E. coli. The EP432/pTM transformants were able to grow in LBK medium supplemented with 100 mm LiCl, which kills untransformed EP432 (data not shown), indicating that the Cys-less Vc-NhaD complemented the EP432 phenotype. Further examination of activity of the Cys-less Vc-NhaD in inside-out membrane vesicles derived from EP432/pTM showed that it is nearly identical to that of the wild type protein with both Na+ and Li+ (Fig. 2). Thus, as in the case of phylogenetically distant Ec-NhaA (17Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1761-1768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 21Rimon A. Tzubery T. Galili L. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14897-14905Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), all cysteines in Vc-NhaD can be replaced without loss of function. Mutagenesis of Conserved His Residues—Fig. 3 summarizes the results of substituting the conserved His residues in Vc-NhaD with Ala. In inside-out sub-bacterial vesicles, H274A, H278A, H450A, and H468A did not change the Na+(Li+)/H+ antiport activity significantly, but H93A and H210A variants displayed an acidic shift of the pH profile of the antiport for both alkali cations (Fig. 3). The shift was more pronounced in the H93A variant, which also responded differently to Na+ and Li+ ions, showing higher activity with Li+ (Fig. 3). To further assess the affinity of H93A and H210A variants to alkali cations, the concentrations of Na+ and Li+ required for half-maximal response (apparent Km values) at pH 7.75 were determined in sub-bacterial vesicles (TABLE ONE). Despite the fact that apparent Km is only indirectly related to the actual Km of the antiporter, this readily measurable parameter is commonly used to characterize antiporter affinity to substrate ions (for example, see Ref. 14Gerchman Y. Rimon A. Venturi M. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3403-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Here again the apparent Km of H93A for Na+ was ∼7-fold higher than in the wild type, whereas its apparent Km for Li+ was unaffected (TABLE ONE). By contrast, there was only a slight increase in the apparent Km of H210A for Li+ (TABLE ONE).TABLE ONEAffinity of different Vc-NhaD variants to alkali cationsMutationApparent Km (pH 7.75)Na+Li+mmWild type1.12.1S390A1.12.1T157A9.539.8S428A5.517.9H93A7.11.9H210A1.34.3 Open table in a new tab Conserved Polar Residues Associated with Putative Transmembrane Segments IV, V, and VI Are Functionally Important—Computer modeling of the Vc-NhaD membrane topology suggests that the highly conserved residues Ser-150, Asp-154, Asn-155, Thr-157, Asp-199, Thr-201, and Thr-202 may form a compact “constellation” on the periplasmic side of the protein (see Fig. 1B). Variants S150A, D154G, N155A, D199A, T201A, T202A, and N189A failed to complement the Li+-sensitive growth phenotype in EP432 (TABLE TWO), and analysis of activity in sub-bacterial vesicles confirmed that they were unable to mediate the Na+- and Li+-dependent H+ transport at pH 6.5-8.75 (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Immunodetection confirmed that this was not due to the impaired expression and/or targeting of mutant variants (Fig. 5). EP432 cells expressing the T157A variant showed slower growth in the presence of 100 mm LiCl (TABLE TWO). The T157A variant also exhibited lower activity in vesicle assays (Fig. 4, A-B) and a decreased affinity for alkali cations (TABLE ONE). Furthermore, the comparison of apparent Km values revealed a difference in responses of the mutated antiporter to alkali cations with Na+ becoming the preferred substrate (TABLE ONE).TABLE TWOGrowth of EP432 cells expressing different Vc-NhaD variants in the LBK medium supplemented with 100 mm LiCl at 37°CVariant expressedDoubling timeminNone (“empty” vector)>300Wild type38S390A37T157A79S428A60S150A, D154G, N155A, N189A, D199A, T201A, T202A, S389A, N394G, S428A, S431A>300 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 5Immunodetection of different variants of Vc-NhaD in the membranes of EP432.

Dzioba J. Loewen P.C. Dibrov P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1564: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Another four nearby polar/charged residues are conserved in NhaD antiporters (Fig. 1A), including Ser-389 and Asn-394 in TMS XI as well as Ser-425 and Ser-431 in TMS XII. In addition, Ser-428 is conserved in proteins belonging to Subgroup 1, whereas Ser-390 is replaced by alanine in many cases (Fig. 1A). These residues were mutagenized to alanine (except Asn-394, which was replaced by glycine), and the anti-port activities were assayed in sub-bacterial vesicles of transformed EP432 (Fig. 4). The activity of the S390A variant was unaffected compared with native protein (Fig. 4, E-F), but mutation of conserved Ser-389, Asn-394, Ser-431, and Ser-425 prevented Na+(Li+)-dependent H+ transfer in vesicles completely (Fig. 4 and data not shown). The S428A and T157A variants displayed similar slow growth of EP432 transformants in LiCl-containing medium (TABLE TWO), lowered activity in vesicles (Fig. 4, C-D), and different response to Na+ and Li+. Km of S428A for Na+ was 5.5 times higher than that of the wild type anti-porter, whereas its Km for Li+ was almost 9-fold elevated (TABLE ONE).

Although monomeric IgE was found to induce a wide variety of responses, such as up-regulation of the FcϵRI, survival, cytokine production, histamine synthesis, and adhesion to fibronectin, it remains to be clarified how mast cells are activated in the absence of antigen. It has been controversial whether monomeric IgE responses are mediated by a similar signaling mechanism to antigen stimulation, although recent studies suggest that IgE can induce the FcϵRI aggregation even in the absence of antigen. In this study, we focused on the role of conventional protein kinase C (cPKC), since this response is suppressed by a specific inhibitor for cPKC. Monomeric IgE-induced Ca2+ influx was not observed in a mouse mastocytoma cell line, which lacks the expression of PKCβII, although Ca2+ influx induced by cross-linking of the FcϵRI was intact. Transfection of PKCβII cDNA was found to restore the Ca2+ influx induced by monomeric IgE in this cell line. Furthermore, the dominant negative form of PKCβII (PKCβII/T500V) significantly suppressed the Ca2+ influx, histamine synthesis, and interleukin-6 production in another mouse mast cell line, which is highly sensitive to monomeric IgE. Expression of PKCβII/T500V was found not to affect the antigen-induced responses. These results suggest that PKCβII plays a critical role in monomeric IgE responses, but not in antigen responses.

Activation of mast cells triggers allergic and inflammatory responses through the release of a wide variety of mediators, such as histamine, arachidonic acid metabolites, and neutral proteases, and modulates immune responses through the production of cytokines and chemokines (1Metcalfe D.D.

One of the prominent mechanisms for activation of mast cells is cross-linking of the FcϵRI, the high affinity receptor for IgE, by the multivalent antigen, and various signaling molecules have been identified in this pathway (3Siraganian R.P.

These results have raised the possibility that monomeric IgE can induce aggregation of the FcϵRI via its antigen binding portion. Indeed, Kitaura et al. (10Kitaura J. Song J. Tsai M. Asai K. Maeda-Yamamoto M. Mocsai A. Kawakami Y. Liu F-T. Lowell C.A. Barisas B.G. Galli S.J. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12911-12916Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) demonstrated the increase in anisotropy of the surface FcϵRI of a rat mast cell line stimulated with monomeric IgE. Very recently, Schweitzer-Stenner and Pecht (18Schweitzer-Stenner R. Pecht I. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 4461-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) performed a simulation analysis for the distance between the surface IgE molecules bound to the FcϵRI and proposed a hypothesis that monomeric IgE induces the receptor aggregation via low affinity interaction between the IgEs or between the IgE and another cell surface component. We recently demonstrated that activation of BMMCs by monomeric IgE requires Ca2+ influx, which is mediated by pharmacologically distinct channels from those activated upon antigen stimulation (17Tanaka S. Mikura S. Hashimoto E. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Based upon this result, we hypothesized that signal transduction activated by monomeric IgE is not only quantitatively but also qualitatively different from that upon antigen stimulation. Since monomeric IgE-induced responses, such as histamine synthesis and IL-6 production, were drastically suppressed by a conventional protein kinase C (cPKC) inhibitor, Gö6976, we particularly focused on the role of cPKC and found the critical role of PKCβII in monomeric IgE-induced activation of mast cells. Cell Culture—A mouse mastocytoma cell line, P-815, and its transfectants were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. P-815/FcϵRI (P-815/Fc), which is a stable cell line that expresses rat FcϵRI α, β, and γ chain cDNAs, is a generous gift from Dr. H. Metzger (National Institutes of Health) (19Miller L. Alber G. Varin-Blank N. Ludowyke R. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 21: 12444-12453Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). A mouse mast cell line, MC9, was maintained under the same conditions in the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-3 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Stable P-815 and MC9 Clones—Mouse PKCβII cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using a pair of primers (forward: 5′-CCG GAT CCG CGC GCG CAA GAT GGC TGA CCC G-3′; reverse: 5′-GGC TCG AGA CGG ATC TAC TTA GCT CTT GAC TTC AGG TT-3′, underlines indicate the restriction sites for BamHI and XhoI) and cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1/Hygro (Invitrogen). P-815/Fc cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1/Hygro containing PKCβII cDNA (pcDNA3.1/Hygro/βII) using GenePORTER transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA), and stable transfectants were selected in the presence of hygromycin (0.1 mg/ml). A dominant negative form of PKCβII (PKCβII/T500V) was constructed as described (20Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27715-27718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subcloned into a lentiviral vector, pLenti6/V5-d-TOPO (Invitrogen). MC9 cells were infected with the recombinant lentivirus prepared according to the manufacturer's instruction, and stable transfectants were selected in the presence of blasticidin (6 μg/ml). PKCβII Expression in COS-7 Expression System—COS-7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1/Hygro/βII and its mutant (pcDNA3.1/Hygro/βII-T500V), respectively, or simultaneously using GenePORTER transfection reagent. Expression of PKCβII was confirmed by immunoblot analysis as described below. Preparation of IgEs—IgEs (an anti-DNP IgE, clone SPE-7, from Sigma, an anti-TNP IgE, clones IgE-3 and c38-2, from BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) were purified before use by centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h for removal of the aggregated form. No significant differences were observed between the IgE purified by centrifugation and the IgE purified by gel filtration in activation of mast cells as a monomeric IgE. We used the clone SPE-7 through this study otherwise stated. Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were homogenized in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.3 containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, and a protease inhibitor mixture (0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml E-64) and were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% slab gel). The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MO). Primary and secondary antibodies were commercially obtained and used; anti-PKCα antibody (1:250, BD Biosciences), anti-PKCβI antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-PKCβII antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PKCγ antibody (1:200, BD Biosciences), anti-actin antibody (1:1000, Chemicon, Temecula, CA), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:3000, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:3000, Dako). The membrane was stained using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Flow Cytometry—Cells were pretreated with 10 μg/ml anti-CD16/32 (2.4G2, BD biosciences) at 4 °C for 10 min, then with 12.5 μg/ml each IgE at 4 °C for 50 min. Labeling of the cells was performed by incubation with an FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgE (BD Biosciences) at 4 °C for 25 min. Flow cytometric analysis of the stained cells was performed with FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) equipped with the CELLQUEST software. IgE-mediated Activation of Mast Cells—Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of an anti-DNP IgE. In case of antigen stimulation, cells were sensitized with 0.3 μg/ml anti-DNP IgE for 24 h, washed three times to remove unbound IgE, and then stimulated with the indicated concentrations of DNP-conjugated human serum albumin (Sigma). Measurement of Cytosolic Ca2+ Concentrations—Cells were loaded with 2 μm Fura-2/AM in the modified Tyrode's buffer (130 mm NaCl containing 5 mm KCl, 1.4 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, NaOH, pH 7.3, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 45 min at room temperature and then washed in the modified Tyrode's buffer. Fluorescent intensities were measured, at an excitation wavelength of 340 or 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 510 nm, with a fluorescence spectrometer (Jasco, CAF-100, Tokyo, Japan). Membrane Translocation of cPKCs—MC9 Cells were treated with 1 μg/ml IgE for the indicated periods or with 100 nm 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate for 10 min. The cells were homogenized and lysed by sonication in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. The resultant homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to separate the cytosolic and membrane fractions. Each fraction was subjected to the immunoblot analysis using the specific PKC antibodies. Measurement of l-Histidine Decarboxylase (HDC) Activity and IL-6 Release—Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline followed by centrifugation and the cell pellet was lysed (1 × 107 cells/ml) with 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.3, containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100 and the protease inhibitor mixture on ice for 10 min. The cells were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for the measurement of HDC activity as described previously (21Safina F. Tanaka S. Inagaki M. Tsuboi K. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14211-14215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). IL-6 release was measured using mouse IL-6 BD OptEIA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system (BD Biosciences). PKCβII Is Required for Monomeric IgE-induced Ca2+ Mobilization in a Mastocytoma Cell Line, P-815—Since activation of mast cells by monomeric IgE was found to be suppressed by a specific inhibitor for cPKC, Gö6976 (22Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schächtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the expression of cPKC subtypes in mast cell lines, MC9 and P-815, by immunoblot analysis. PKCα, βI, and βII were expressed in MC9 cells, whereas PKCα and βI, but not βII, in P-815 cells (Fig. 1A). Expression of PKCγ was not observed in P-815 and MC9 cells (data not shown). Since P-815 cells lack FcϵRI α and β chains and the expression level of γ chain is low, we used a stable clone, P-815/Fc, which expresses sufficient amount of all three chains. IgE (clone SPE-7)-mediated Ca2+ mobilization was not observed in the parental P-815 cells due to the lack of FcϵRI expression (Fig. 1, B and C). Although IgE-mediated antigen stimulation induced the intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in P-815/Fc cells, monomeric IgE failed to induce Ca2+ mobilization (Fig. 1C). We then prepared a stable clone, P-815/Fc/βII, which expresses PKCβII (Fig. 1A). In this clone, intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was observed not only upon antigen stimulation but also by monomeric IgE (Fig. 1C). The optimal condition of antigen stimulation was not changed in this clone (data not shown). Equal levels of surface expression of FcϵRI were verified by flow cytometry in P-815/Fc and P-815/Fc/βII cells, indicating that PKCβII did not affect the surface expression of FcϵRI (Fig. 1B). No or little changes of Ca2+ mobilization induced by thrombin, which evokes Ca2+ mobilization by acting on the heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptor, were observed between P-815/Fc and P-815/Fc/βII cells. We investigated the monomeric IgE-induced Ca2+ mobilization using the other IgE clones, which exhibit the similar levels of surface binding to the clone, SPE-7 (Fig. 2A). An IgE clone, c38-2, was found to induce Ca2+ mobilization as well as SPE-7, whereas another clone, IgE-3, was not. These differential effects of the IgE clones were also observed in BMMCs (17Tanaka S. Mikura S. Hashimoto E. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Monomeric IgE-induced Ca2+ mobilization in P-815/Fc/βII cells was suppressed by Gö6976, staurosporine, and a specific inhibitor of store-operated Ca2+ channels, SK&F96365, but not by La3+, Gd3+, which is consistent with our previous results using BMMCs (17Tanaka S. Mikura S. Hashimoto E. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Characterization of monomeric IgE-induced Ca2+ mobilization in P-815/Fc/βII cells.A, surface binding of various IgE clones (SPE-7, IgE-3, and c38-2) was measured by flow cytometry using an FITC-conjugated anti-IgE antibody (left). Ca2+ mobilization induced by each IgE clone (3 μg/ml) was investigated as described in the legend to Fig. 1C (right). These are representative figures of three independent experiments showing similar results. B, P-815/Fc/βII cells were pretreated with SK&F96365 (100 μm, 3 min), LaCl3 (30 μm, 3 min), GdCl3 (30 μm, 3 min), Gö6976 (1 μm, 60 min), or staurosporine (10 nm and 100 nm, 30 min) before stimulation with IgE (3 μg/ml). Changes in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations were monitored using Fura-2/AM and presented as a ratio. The time point of each stimulation is indicated by the arrow. Bar = 1 min. This is a representative figure of three independent experiments showing similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Lentiviral Expression of the Dominant Negative Form of PKCβII in MC9 Cells—Since our preliminary study revealed that MC9 cells are highly sensitive to monomeric IgE, we first investigated the membrane translocation of cPKCs. A minor portion of cPKCs expressing in MC9 cells was found to rapidly translocate to the membrane fractions by monomeric IgE. Relatively prolonged translocation of PKCβII was observed compared with PKCα and βI (Fig. 3). Previous study demonstrated that Thr500, which is located in the activation loop of PKC and phosphorylated, is one of the critical residues for kinase activity of PKCβII and that the mutation of this residue to Val (PKCβII/T500V) resulted in the loss-of-function (20Orr J.W.

We, therefore, prepared the stable MC9 clones, which express this mutant form of PKCβII, to evaluate its dominant negative effects on monomeric IgE-induced activation. Several clones that express unphosphorylated PKCβII were obtained. We selected two clones with high expression levels of the mutant PKCβII, MC9/DN1 and MC9/DN2. In these clones, high expression levels of the unphosphorylated PKCβII were observed, whereas little or no expression of the phosphorylated form was detected (Fig. 4A). It remains unknown why the phosphorylated form disappears in the presence of PKCβII/T500V. We investigated the expression of PKCβII and PKCβII/T500V in a mammalian expression system using COS-7 cells, which lack endogenous PKCβII. The phosphorylated form was also undetectable in the cells co-transfected with the wild and mutant PKCβII cDNA, although each form was detectable in the cells transfected with its cDNA alone (Fig. 4B). The expression of PKCβII/T500V did not affect the expression levels of the other cPKCs, PKCα and βI (Fig. 4A). Expression of PKCβII/T500V did not affect the surface expression of FcϵRI in MC9 cells (Fig. 4C).FIGURE 4Expression of the dominant negative form of PKCβII in MC9 cells.A, expression of PKCα, βI, and βII in MC9 and its transfectants with PKCβII/T500V (two clones, DN1 and DN2) was investigated by immunoblot analysis as described under “Materials and Methods.” The amount of actin in each lane was also determined as a loading control. The arrows indicate the phosphorylated (upper band) and unphosphorylated (lower band) forms. B, COS-7 cells were transfected with the wild type PKCβII cDNA (WT), T500V mutant cDNA (DN), and the mixture of both cDNAs (WT/DN). Expression of PKCβII was investigated by immunoblot analysis, respectively. The arrows indicate the phosphorylated (upper band) and unphosphorylated (lower band) forms. C, surface expression of FcϵRI was measured by flow cytometry using an anti-DNP IgE and an FITC-conjugated anti-IgE antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Suppression of Monomeric IgE-induced Activation in MC9 Cells Expressing the Dominant Negative Form of PKCβII—We then evaluated the dominant negative effects of PKCβII/T500V on monomeric IgE-induced activation. Ca2+ mobilization induced by monomeric IgE was partially suppressed in MC9/DN clones, whereas Ca2+ mobilization upon antigen stimulation was unchanged (Fig. 5). Since induction of HDC activity was observed in MC9 cells both by monomeric IgE and upon antigen stimulation (Fig. 6A, B), we then investigated the effects of PKCβII/T500V on induction of HDC. PKCβII/T500V was found to significantly suppress the induction of HDC by monomeric IgE but not upon antigen stimulation (Fig. 6C). No changes in the dose response curve were observed in between MC9 cells and each DN clone (data not shown). Similarly, monomeric IgE-induced IL-6 release was also significantly suppressed by PKCβII/T500V, whereas antigen-induced IL-6 release was not (Fig. 6D).FIGURE 6PKCβII/T500V suppresses histamine synthesis and IL-6 release induced by monomeric IgE, not upon antigen stimulation in MC9 cells.A and B, induction of HDC activity in MC9 cells was measured. MC9 cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of IgE for 6 h (A) or were sensitized with 0.3 μg/ml IgE for 24 h followed by the antigen stimulation at the indicated concentrations for 6 h (B). Values are represented by the means ± S.E. (n = 6). C and D, HDC activity (C) and IL-6 release (D) induced by monomeric IgE (IgE, 1 μg/ml, upper panel) or antigen stimulation (IgE/Ag, cells were sensitized with 0.3 μg/ml anti-DNP IgE for 24 h and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml DNP-conjugated human serum albumin, lower panel) was presented. Values are represented by the means ± S.E. (n = 3). *, p < 0.01 is regarded as significant by the Student's t test. Basal activity of HDC was <10 pmol/min/mg, and no spontaneous release of IL-6 was detected in each MC9 clone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We focused on the role of cPKC in IgE-mediated activation of mast cells and found that PKCβII plays a critical role in monomeric IgE-induced responses but not in antigen responses. Previous studies have cast some doubt on the differences in signal transduction between monomeric IgE responses and antigen responses; they speculated that monomeric IgE can induce the FcϵRI-aggregation and that a similar signaling pathway is activated upon both responses with different intensities (10Kitaura J. Song J. Tsai M. Asai K. Maeda-Yamamoto M. Mocsai A. Kawakami Y. Liu F-T. Lowell C.A. Barisas B.G. Galli S.J. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Accumulating evidence has indicated that the FcϵRI-mediated activation of mast cells is finely tuned. Gonzalez-Espinosa et al. (23Gonzalez-Espinosa C. Odom S. Olivera A. Hobson J.P. Martinez M.E.C. Oliveira-dos-Santos A. Barra L. Spiegel S. Penninger J.M. Rivera J. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1453-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) demonstrated that several chemokines, such as MCP-1, are released at low antigen concentrations or at low receptor occupancy with IgE compared with several cytokines such as IL-3 and IL-10. This result indicated that antigen-induced IL-3 release requires a “strong” stimulation, in which linker for activation of T cells (LAT) and ERK are extensively phosphorylated. On the other hand, Kohno et al. (11Kohno M. Yamasaki S. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Saito T. Blood. 2005; 105: 2059-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) demonstrated that monomeric IgE-induced survival of BMMCs is mediated by a large amount of IL-3 autocrine production. In this study, IL-3 production by monomeric IgE was found to be much larger than that upon antigen stimulation. Since monomeric IgE was found to elicit a “weak and sustained” signal transduction including ERK phosphorylation (9Kalesnikoff J. Huber M. Lam V. Damen J.E. Zang J. Shiraganian R.P. Krsytal G. Immunity. 2001; 14: 801-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), it is likely that IL-3 production by monomeric IgE is regulated by a different mechanism from that upon antigen stimulation. We also found that IL-6 production in MC9 cells stimulated with monomeric IgE was much larger than that upon antigen stimulation under the optimized condition. Our current results clearly demonstrated that PKCβII is a prerequisite component for monomeric IgE-induced activation of mast cells but not for antigen responses. We previously demonstrated that Ca2+ influx induced by monomeric IgE is mediated by channels different from Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channel, which is utilized upon antigen responses, using several channel blockers (17Tanaka S. Mikura S. Hashimoto E. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We propose that the signaling cascades activated by monomeric IgE are distinguishable from those upon cross-linking of the FcϵRI by multivalent antigen. A mouse mastocytoma cell line, P-815, is a suitable model for the analysis of FcϵRI-mediated activation, since it lacks the surface expression of FcϵRI (19Miller L. Alber G. Varin-Blank N. Ludowyke R. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 21: 12444-12453Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). We can exhibit the direct evidence of involvement of the FcϵRI in monomeric IgE responses using this cell line, which is consistent with the recent study using BMMCs derived from the FcϵRIα deficient mice (24Kitaura J. Kinoshita T. Matsumoto M. Chung S. Kawakami Y. Leitges M. Wu D. Lowell C.A. Kawakami T. Blood. 2005; 105: 3222-3229Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Restored Ca2+ influx by PKCβII was observed only in the presence of certain IgE clones and exhibited a similar sensitivity to various kinase inhibitors and channel blockers to that observed in BMMCs (17Tanaka S. Mikura S. Hashimoto E. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), indicating that the responses in P-815 cells reproduce those observed in BMMCs. However, no or little induction of HDC and IL-6 was observed upon monomeric IgE treatment or antigen stimulation in P-815 and its transfectants. Since potent activators of mast cells, such as A23187 and thapsigargin, failed to induce histamine synthesis and IL-6 release in P-815 cells (maximum IL-6 release <0.1 pg/ml, data not shown), it is quite difficult to evaluate the effects of IgE-mediated responses. Although detectable levels of IL-6 were found in the concentrated medium of unstimulated P-815 cells, no increase of IL-6 was observed in the presence of A23187. P-815 cells may lack signaling molecules downstream of Ca2+ influx, which are required for detectable levels of induction of HDC and IL-6. The suppressive effects of the mutant PKCβII/T500V on monomeric IgE-induced activation of MC9 cells were consistent with the results obtained in P-815 cells transfected with PKCβII. These suppressive effects were found exclusively in monomeric IgE responses, not in antigen stimulation. Since PKCβI and βII are generated by alternative splicing of the carboxyl-terminal exons and exhibit little differences in enzymatic characters (25Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Ogita K. Fujii T. Kurokawa T. Asaoka Y. Sekiguchi K. Ase K. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. Science. 1987; 236: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), there have been few studies on the specific roles of each isoform of PKCβII in mast cells. Although previous study using PKCβ deficient mice revealed that BMMC lacking both PKCβI and βII exhibited lower levels of degranulation and IL-6 release than the wild type cells in response to antigen (26Nechushtan H. Leitges M. Cohen C. Kay G. Razin E. Blood. 2000; 95: 1752-1757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it remains to be clarified which isoform is responsible for degranulation and IL-6 release. Kawakami et al. (27Kawakami Y. Kitaura J. Hartman S.E. Lowell C.A. Siraganian R.P. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7423-7428Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 28Kawakami Y. Kitaura J. Yao L. Mchenry R.W. Kawakami Y. Newton A.C. Kang S. Kato R.M. Leitges M. Rawlings D. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl.

Weak activation of PKCβII upon antigen stimulation is consistent with our results that PKCβII did not affect the antigen responses. Very recently, Kawakami et al. (29Kitaura J. Asai K. Maeda-Yamamoto M. Kawakami Y. Kikkawa U. Kawakami T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PKCβII plays a dominant role in phosphorylation of Akt on Ser473, which contributes to cytokine production, in BMMC upon antigen stimulation (30Kawakami Y. Nishimoto H. Kitaura J. Maeda-Yamamoto M. Kato R.M. Littman D.R. Rawlings D.J. Kawakami T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47720-47725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). They compared the role of PKCβI and βII retrovirally transduced into BMMC derived from PKCβ-deficient mice. Although antigen-induced histamine release was restored by either of PKCβ isoform, antigen-induced IL-2 release was found to be completely dependent on PKCβII. This result clearly indicated the specific role of PKCβII in the signal transduction downstream of FcϵRI. The PKCβII-Akt pathway may play an important role in monomeric IgE-induced activation of mast cells. It remains unknown how PKCβII is activated by monomeric IgE. Kawakami et al. (28Kawakami Y. Kitaura J. Yao L. Mchenry R.W. Kawakami Y. Newton A.C. Kang S. Kato R.M. Leitges M. Rawlings D. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9470-9475Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) demonstrated that 20-70% of PKCβII was localized in the membrane fraction of resting BMMC and only a part of it was tyrosine-phosphorylated upon antigen stimulation. We found that less than 1% of PKCβII is localized in the membrane fraction of MC9 cells and that a minor population of PKCβII was translocated to the membrane fraction by monomeric IgE. Antigen stimulation failed to induce detectable membrane translocation of PKCβII in MC9 cells (data not shown). We prepared another stable MC9 clone, in which an RNA interference sequence for the unique region of PKCβII is retrovirally transduced. Although ∼70% suppression of PKCβII expression on immunoblot analysis was achieved in this clone, no significant suppression was detected in Ca2+ mobilization, histamine synthesis, and IL-6 production, when the cells were stimulated with monomeric IgE (data not shown). These results suggest that a small portion of PKCβII may be able to mediate the monomeric IgE-induced signal transduction. The suppression of monomeric IgE-induced activation by the mutant PKCβII/T500V was found to be significant but partial. However, potency of suppression by each DN clone was correlated with the amount of the unphosphorylated form expressed in each clone. A very low and undetectable level of phosphorylated form of PKCβII may be responsible for the residual HDC and IL-6 expression induced by monomeric IgE in these clones. The region specific for PKCβII contains 52 amino acids and is homologous to the corresponding region of PKCβI. PKCβII was found to bind to RACK1 (the first receptor of activated C kinase) via its C2 domain and carboxyl-terminal specific region (V5 region) with higher affinity than PKCβI (31Stebbins E.G. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29644-29650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although we could detect the binding of PKCβII to RACK1 in MC9 cells, the amount of bound PKCβII was not changed by monomeric IgE (data not shown). Although specific physiological functions of PKCβII remain to be figured out, several studies have suggested the critical role of PKCβII in vivo. Liu et al. demonstrated that azoxymethane-induced colon carcinogenesis was abolished in PKCβ KO mice and that transduction of PKCβII can restore its susceptibility (32Liu Y. Su W. Thompson E.A. Leitges M. Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45556-45563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Todt et al. (33Todt J.C. Hu B. Punturieri A. Sonstein J. Polak T. Curtis J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35906-35914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) suggested that PKCβII is involved in phagocytosis of apoptic cells by murine peritoneal macrophages with pharmacological approaches. We revealed in this study that PKCβ isoforms are specifically exploited in the FcϵRI-mediated signal transduction in mast cells. We thank Dr. K. Nakayama (Kyoto University) for his invaluable advice on this study."
