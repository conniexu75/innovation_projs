https://openalex.org/W2906814446,"Acarological surveys in areas outside the currently believed leading edge of the distribution of lone star ticks (Amblyomma americanum), coupled with recent reports of their identification in previously uninvaded areas in the public health literature, suggest that this species is more broadly distributed in North America than currently understood. Therefore, we evaluated the potential geographic extent under present and future conditions using ecological niche modeling approach based on museum records available for this species at the Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit (WRBU). The median prediction of a best fitting model indicated that lone star ticks are currently likely to be present in broader regions across the Eastern Seaboard as well as in the Upper Midwest, where this species could be expanding its range. Further northward and westward expansion of these ticks can be expected as a result of ongoing climate change, under both low- and high-emissions scenarios."

However, whether PRIMA-1 can clear p53 aggregates is unclear. In this study, we investigated whether PRIMA-1 can restore aggregated mutant p53 to a native form. We observed that the p53 mutant protein is more sensitive to both PRIMA-1 and MQ aggregation inhibition than WT p53. The results of anti-amyloid oligomer antibody assays revealed that PRIMA-1 reverses mutant p53 aggregate accumulation in cancer cells. Size-exclusion chromatography of the lysates from mutant p53-containing breast cancer and ovarian cell lines confirmed that PRIMA-1 substantially decreases p53 aggregates. We also show that MDA-MB-231 cell lysates can “seed” aggregation of the central core domain of recombinant WT p53, corroborating the prion-like behavior of mutant p53. We also noted that this aggregation effect was inhibited by MQ and PRIMA-1. This study provides the first demonstration that PRIMA-1 can rescue amyloid-state p53 mutants, a strategy that could be further explored as a cancer treatment. p53 mutants can form amyloid-like structures that accumulate in cells. p53 reactivation with induction of massive apoptosis-1 (PRIMA-1) and its primary active metabolite, 2-methylene-3-quinuclidinone (MQ), can restore unfolded p53 mutants to a native conformation that induces apoptosis and activates several p53 target genes.

https://openalex.org/W2907351456,"Hepatic fibrosis develops from a series of complex interactions among resident and recruited cells making it a challenge to replicate using standard in vitro approaches. While studies have demonstrated the importance of macrophages in fibrogenesis, the role of Kupffer cells (KCs) in modulating the initial response remains elusive. Previous work demonstrated utility of 3D bioprinted liver to recapitulate basic fibrogenic features following treatment with fibrosis-associated agents. In the present study, culture conditions were modified to recapitulate a gradual accumulation of collagen within the tissues over an extended exposure timeframe. Under these conditions, KCs were added to the model to examine their impact on the injury/fibrogenic response following cytokine and drug stimuli. A 28-day exposure to 10 ng/mL TGF-β1 and 0.209 μM methotrexate (MTX) resulted in sustained LDH release which was attenuated when KCs were incorporated in the model. Assessment of miR-122 confirmed early hepatocyte injury in response to TGF-β1 that appeared delayed in the presence of KCs, whereas MTX-induced increases in miR-122 were observed when KCs were incorporated in the model. Although the collagen responses were mild under the conditions tested to mimic early fibrotic injury, a global reduction in cytokines was observed in the KC-modified tissue model following treatment. Furthermore, gene expression profiling suggests KCs have a significant impact on baseline tissue function over time and an important modulatory role dependent on the context of injury. Although the number of differentially expressed genes across treatments was comparable, pathway enrichment suggests distinct, KC- and time-dependent changes in the transcriptome for each agent. As such, the incorporation of KCs and impact on baseline tissue homeostasis may be important in recapitulating temporal dynamics of the fibrogenic response to different agents."
https://openalex.org/W2907121739,"Blood cultures are considered the gold standard to distinguish bacteremia from non-bacteremic systemic inflammation. In current clinical practice, bacteraemia is considered unlikely if blood cultures have been negative for 48-72 hours. Modern BC systems have reduced this time-to-positivity (TTP), questioning whether the time frame of 48-72 hrs is still valid. This study investigates the distribution of TTP, the probability of blood culture positivity after 24 hours, and identifies clinical predictors of prolonged TTP.Adult patients with monomicrobial bacteremia in an academic hospital were included retrospectively over a three-year period. Clinical data were retrieved from the medical records. Predictors of TTP >24 hours were determined by uni- and multivariate analyses. The residual probability of bacteremia was estimated for the scenario of negative BCs at 24 hours after bedside collection.The cohort consisted of 801 patients, accounting for 897 episodes of bacteremia. Mean age was 65 years (IQR 54-73), 534 (59.5%) patients were male. Median TTP was 15.7 (IQR 13.5-19.3) hours. TTP was ≤24 hours in 85.3% of episodes. Antibiotic pre-treatment (adjusted OR 1.77; 95%CI 1.14-2.74, p<0.01) was independently associated with prolonged TTP. The probability of bacteremia, if BC had remained negative for 24 hours, was 1.8% (95% CI 1.46-2.14).With adequate hospital logistics, the probability of positive blood cultures after 24 hours of negative cultures was low. Combined with clinical reassessment, knowledge of this low probability may contribute to prioritization of the differential diagnosis and decisions on antimicrobial therapy. As a potential antibiotic stewardship tool, this strategy warrants further prospective investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2889186833,"Nutritional deficiencies are a major problem among developing countries including Myanmar. They can occur in all age groups, but the impact is more severe among children age 6-23 months as this period is critical for child development, and irreversible damages can occur due to nutritional deficiencies. Proper infant and young child feeding practices are pivotal to tackle nutritional problems and to prevent irreversible consequences among children. To assess the current feeding practices and associations with nutritional status, we conducted a secondary data analysis using the 2015-16 Myanmar Demographic and Health Survey. Multiple logistic regression analysis was done adjusting for covariates and the results were presented by adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. A total of 1,222 children age 6-23 months were included in this analysis. Twenty percent were stunted and 43% were moderately anemic. Only 16% of children received a minimum acceptable diet, 25% received diverse food groups, 58% were fed with minimum meal frequency, 85% currently breastfed, and 59% consumed iron-rich foods. Breastfeeding reduced the odds of being stunted. Male sex, perceived small birth size, mother with short stature, and working mother were significant predictors of stunting. Iron-rich food consumption was inversely associated with moderate anemia. Male sex and maternal anemia were also significant predictors of moderate anemia. The study concluded that stunting and anemia among young children in Myanmar are major public health challenges that need urgent action. While further prospective research is needed to determine the effect of feeding practice on linear growth, interventions such as iron supplementation, and nutritional education programs according to the World Health Organization complementary feeding guidelines could help prevent stunting and childhood anemia and might reduce their prevalence in Myanmar."
https://openalex.org/W2888054673,"Rapid and extensive urbanization has adversely impacted humans and ecological entities in the recent decades through a decrease in surface permeability and the emergence of Urban Heat Islands (UHI). While detailed and continuous assessments of surface permeability and UHI are crucial for urban planning and management of landuse zones, they mostly involve time consuming and expensive field studies and single sensor derived large scale aerial and satellite imageries. We demonstrated the advantage of fusing imageries from multiple sensors for landuse and landcover (LULC) change assessments as well as for assessing surface permeability and temperature and UHI emergence in a fast growing city, i.e. Tirunelveli, Tamilnadu, India. IRS-LISSIII and Landsat-7 ETM+ imageries were fused for 2007 and 2017, and classified using a Rotation Forest (RF) algorithm. Surface permeability and temperature were then quantified using Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) index, respectively. Finally, we assessed the relationship between SAVI and LST for entire Tirunelveli as well as for each LULC zone, and also detected UHI emergence hot spots using a SAVI-LST combined metric. Our fused images exhibited higher classification accuracies, i.e. overall kappa coefficient values, than non-fused images. We observed an overall increase in the coverage of urban (dry, real estate plots and built-up) areas, while a decrease for vegetated (cropland and forest) areas in Tirunelveli between 2007 and 2017. The SAVI values indicated an extensive decrease in surface permeability for Tirunelveli overall and also for almost all LULC zones. The LST values showed an overall increase of surface temperature in Tirunelveli with the highest increase for urban built-up areas between 2007 and 2017. LST also exhibited a strong negative association with SAVI. Southeastern built-up areas in Tirunelveli were depicted as a potential UHI hotspot, with a caution for the Western riparian zone for UHI emergence in 2017. Our results provide important metrics for surface permeability, temperature and UHI monitoring, and inform urban and zonal planning authorities about the advantages of satellite image fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2908218376,"Metallic Zn alloys have recently gained interest as potential candidates for developing platforms of bioresorbable vascular stents (BVS). Previous studies revealed that Mg alloys used for BVS can degrade too early, whereas PLLA materials may fail to provide effective scaffolding properties. Here we report on results of a new bioresorbable, metallic stent made from a Zn-Ag alloy studied in a porcine animal model of thrombosis and restenosis. While the tensile strength (MPa) of Zn-3Ag was higher than that of PLLA and resembled Mg's (WE43), fracture elongation (%) of Zn-3Ag was much greater (18-fold) than the PLLA's or Mg alloy's (WE43). Zn-3Ag exposed to HAoSMC culture medium for 30 days revealed degradation elements consisting of Zn, O, N, C, P, and Na at a 6 nm surface depth. Platelet adhesion rates and blood biocompatibility did not differ between Zn-3Ag, PLLA, Mg (WE43), and non-resorbable Nitinol (NiTi) stent materials. Balloon-expandable Zn-3Ag alloy BVS implanted into iliofemoral arteries of 15 juvenile domestic pigs were easily visible fluoroscopically at implantation, and their bioresorption was readily detectable via X-ray over time. Histologically, arteries with Zn-3Ag BVS were completely endothelialized, covered with neointima, and were patent at 1, 3, and 6 months follow-up with no signs of stent thrombosis. Zn-3Ag alloy appears to be a promising material platform for the fabrication of a new generation of bioresorbable vascular stents."

(Huaier) is a mushroom with a long history of use as a medicinal ingredient in China and exhibits good clinical efficacy in cancer management. However, the antitumor components of Huaier and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we isolated a proteoglycan with a molecular mass of ∼5.59 × 104 Da from Huaier aqueous extract. We named this proteoglycan TPG-1, and using FTIR and additional biochemical analyses, we determined that its total carbohydrate and protein compositions are 43.9 and 41.2%, respectively. Using biochemical assays and immunoblotting, we found that exposing murine RAW264.7 macrophages to TPG-1 promotes the production of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent activation of NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Of note, the TPG-1 treatment significantly inhibited the tumorigenesis of human hepatoma HepG2 cells likely at least in part by increasing serum levels of TNFα and promoting leukocyte infiltration into tumors in nude mice. TPG-1 also exhibited good antitumor activity in hepatoma H22-bearing mice and had no obvious adverse effects in these mice. We conclude that TPG-1 exerts antitumor activity partially through an immune-potentiating effect due to activation of the TLR4–NF-κB/MAPK signaling cassette. Therefore, TPG-1 may be a promising candidate drug for cancer immunotherapy. This study has identified the TPG-1 proteoglycan as an antitumor agent and provided insights into TPG-1’s molecular mechanism, suggesting a potential utility for applying this agent in cancer therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2908384155,"Mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) cause 15–20% of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS) cases. The resulting amino acid substitutions destabilize SOD1's protein structure, leading to its self-assembly into neurotoxic oligomers and aggregates, a process hypothesized to cause the characteristic motor-neuron degeneration in affected individuals. Currently, effective disease-modifying therapy is not available for ALS. Molecular tweezers prevent formation of toxic protein assemblies, yet their protective action has not been tested previously on SOD1 or in the context of ALS. Here, we tested the molecular tweezer CLR01–a broad-spectrum inhibitor of the self-assembly and toxicity of amyloid proteins–as a potential therapeutic agent for ALS. Using recombinant WT and mutant SOD1, we found that CLR01 inhibited the aggregation of all tested SOD1 forms in vitro. Next, we examined whether CLR01 could prevent the formation of misfolded SOD1 in the G93A-SOD1 mouse model of ALS and whether such inhibition would have a beneficial therapeutic effect. CLR01 treatment decreased misfolded SOD1 in the spinal cord significantly. However, these histological findings did not correlate with improvement of the disease phenotype. A small, dose-dependent decrease in disease duration was found in CLR01-treated mice, relative to vehicle-treated animals, yet motor function did not improve in any of the treatment groups. These results demonstrate that CLR01 can inhibit SOD1 misfolding and aggregation both in vitro and in vivo, but raise the question whether such inhibition is sufficient for achieving a therapeutic effect.

The resulting progressive muscle weakness and atrophy leads to death typically occurring 3–5 years after onset. Approximately 90–95% of ALS cases are sporadic, and the remaining cases are familial (fALS), caused by mutations in multiple genes (1Chiò A. Logroscino G. Traynor B.J. Collins J. Simeone J.C. Goldstein L.A. White L.A. Global epidemiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a systematic review of the published literature.Neuroepidemiology. 2013; 41 (23860588): 118-13010.1159/000351153Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). More than 160 mutations in the SOD1 gene, encoding the enzyme superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), have been described to cause amino acid substitutions that destabilize the protein leading to its aberrant self-assembly, which causes 15–20% of fALS cases (2Sreedharan J. Brown Jr., R.H. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: problems and prospects.Ann.

SOD1 is a homodimer of a 153-amino acid polypeptide. The enzyme converts the superoxide ions produced by mitochondria into hydrogen peroxide. Some disease-associated SOD1 variants retain high activity (3Ratovitski T. Corson L.B. Strain J. Wong P. Cleveland D.W. Culotta V.C. Borchelt D.R. Variation in the biochemical/biophysical properties of mutant superoxide dismutase 1 enzymes and the rate of disease progression in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis kindreds.Hum. Mol.

Therefore, the mechanism by which mutant SOD1 causes ALS is believed to be not a loss of function but rather a gain of toxic function upon misfolding and self-assembly into neurotoxic oligomers and aggregates (5Johnston J.A.

The latter are found in the brain and spinal cord of affected individuals as intracellular inclusions. To date, two drugs have been approved for treatment of ALS: riluzole (7Martin D. Thompson M.A. Nadler J.V. The neuroprotective agent riluzole inhibits release of glutamate and aspartate from slices of hippocampal area CA1.Eur. J.

These drugs slow disease progression mildly but do not alter substantially the disease course. Thus, there is an urgent need for a disease-modifying therapy that would halt the progression and ultimately cure ALS. Inhibition and modulation of aberrant protein self-assembly are promising strategies for therapy development, which have been explored quite extensively for other proteinopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) (9Liu T. Bitan G. Modulating self-assembly of amyloidogenic proteins as a therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases: strategies and mechanisms.Chem. Med. Chem. 2012; 7 (22323134): 359-37410.1002/cmdc.201100585Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In contrast, to date, few studies have examined small-molecule inhibitors of SOD1 self-assembly as a potential therapy for ALS. A study using pyrimidine-2,4,6-triones showed protection from SOD1-induced cytotoxicity in cultured cells (10Xia G. Benmohamed R. Kim J. Arvanites A.C. Morimoto R.I. Ferrante R.J. Kirsch D.R.

Using a different mechanism, restoration of cellular protein degradation by activation of the proteasome, pyrazolones have been found to protect PC-12 cells against the toxicity of G93A-SOD1 (11Trippier P.C. Zhao K.T. Fox S.G. Schiefer I.T. Benmohamed R. Moran J. Kirsch D.R. Morimoto R.I. Silverman R.B.

In yet a third approach, in silico screening identified azauracil- and uracil-based inhibitors, which stabilized mutant SOD1 against aggregation in human plasma (12Nowak R.J. Cuny G.D. Choi S.

These few examples highlight the need for further exploration of strategies directed at misfolded SOD1 self-assembly as a potential target for ALS therapy. SOD1 was the first gene linked to familial ALS (13Rosen D.R. Siddique T. Patterson D. Figlewicz D.A. Sapp P. Hentati A. Donaldson D. Goto J. O'Regan J.P. Deng H.X.

A transgenic mouse model of ALS, expressing human SOD1 containing a G93A substitution, was first introduced in 1996 (14Gurney M.E. Pu H. Chiu A.Y. Dal Canto M.C. Polchow C.Y. Alexander D.D. Caliendo J. Hentati A. Kwon Y.W. Deng H.X. Motor neuron degeneration in mice that express a human Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase mutation.Science. 1994; 264 (8209258): 1772-177510.1126/science.8209258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3470) Google Scholar). Although this model is not ideal, as it expresses a high copy number of the transgene and consequently displays highly aggressive disease progression, it has remained not only the most thoroughly characterized ALS animal model, but also has been regarded as the gold standard in preclinical therapeutic ALS research. This mouse model mimics motor neuron loss and progressive muscle weakness (15Kim R.B. Irvin C.W. Tilva K.R. Mitchell C.S. State of the field: an informatics-based systematic review of the SOD1-G93A amyotrophic lateral sclerosis transgenic mouse model.Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener. 2015; 17 (25998063): 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) similar to the clinical symptoms of human ALS. The mouse model has facilitated studying mechanistic aspects of the disease, yet the rapid course of the disease may be too aggressive for many therapeutic approaches to have an effect.

CLR01 acts as a nanochaperone by a “process-specific” mechanism, i.e. it targets the process of abnormal protein self-assembly itself rather than a particular protein. CLR01 achieves this activity by labile binding to positively charged amino acid residues, primarily Lys and to a lower extent Arg, temporarily reversing the charge from positive to negative and disrupting hydrophobic interactions in which the butylene moiety of the Lys side chain (or the propylene chain in the Arg side chain) participate. As hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions are important, particularly in the early stages of the aberrant self-assembly process in which oligomers and aggregation nuclei form, MTs effectively interfere with the formation of these early assemblies. CLR01 has been shown to have beneficial therapeutic effects in multiple animal models of various proteinopathies, including rodent models of AD (18Malik R. Di J. Nair G. Attar A. Taylor K. Teng E.

However, to date, MTs have not been explored in the context of ALS in general or for inhibition of the aggregation and toxicity of SOD1 in particular. Here, we evaluated the effect of CLR01 on SOD1 aggregation in vitro and in the G93A-SOD1 mouse model of ALS. Our data reveal that CLR01 inhibits the aggregation of WT and disease-associated variant SOD1 in vitro and reduces the accumulation of misfolded SOD1 in mice. However, reduction of misfolded SOD1 did not result in significant therapeutic effects, possibly due to the fast disease progression in this model or due to other reasons discussed below. WT and variant SOD1 were expressed in yeast cells and purified using serial chromatography, as described previously (28Chattopadhyay M. Durazo A. Sohn S.H. Strong C.D. Gralla E.B. Whitelegge J.P. Valentine J.S. Initiation and elongation in fibrillation of ALS-linked superoxide dismutase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Each variant was de-metallated by incubation with excess EDTA and stored at −80 °C until use. The disease-associated variants included E21K, H46R, D76Y, and G93A. Aggregation kinetics were measured using the thioflavin-T (ThT) fluorescence assay, and the morphology of the aggregates was visualized by electron microscopy (EM). To induce misfolding and monitor aggregation, 40 μm of each variant were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in a 96-well plate with constant agitation in the presence of 50 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) to reduce disulfide bonds and increasing concentrations of CLR01. A Teflon ball was added to each well to facilitate the aggregation, as described previously (30Giehm L. Otzen D.E. Strategies to increase the reproducibility of protein fibrillization in plate reader assays.Anal. Biochem. 2010; 400 (20149780): 270-28110.1016/j.ab.2010.02.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In the absence of CLR01, all the variants showed a typical time-dependent sigmoidal increase in ThT fluorescence consisting of an initial lag phase indicating misfolding and nucleation, followed by an exponential increase in fluorescence, and finally a plateau when most of the monomers have been exhausted (Fig. 1, A–E, red curve). In the presence of CLR01, dose-dependent inhibition of the aggregation was observed in all cases. The dose dependence of the inhibition varied for the different isoforms but was complete or nearly complete at 5-fold excess CLR01 in all cases (Fig. 1, A–E, green curve). Examination of the ThT curves showed that CLR01 affected all the stages of the aggregation process, including the lag phase (Fig. S1A), the slope of the exponential phase (Fig. S1B), and the final plateau (Fig. S1C), although the dose dependence of the inhibition varied among the different variants. As shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. S1, in some cases, e.g. WT SOD1, little inhibition was observed at a 1:1 SOD1/CLR01 ratio, whereas in other cases, such as H46R-SOD1, substantial inhibition was found already with equimolar CLR01. The additional binding sites for CLR01 at Lys-21 in E21K-SOD1 and Arg-46 in H46R-SOD1 did not appear to play a major role in the activity of the compound. The exact mechanism underlying the differences among the SOD1 variants is not known and will require further investigation. Morphological examination by EM showed that in the absence of CLR01, all the SOD1 variants formed primarily amorphous aggregates (Fig. 1, F–J). After a long incubation (30–60 days), typical amyloid fibrils also were apparent (Fig. 2). In the presence of equimolar concentrations of CLR01, smaller aggregates were observed (Fig. 1, K–O). This reduction of aggregate size was consistent in all cases, but it did not correlate well with the ThT results. For example, in the cases of WT SOD1 or E21K-SOD1, the ThT change in the presence of equimolar CLR01 was similar to the control reactions in the absence of CLR01, yet the morphological examination showed substantially smaller aggregates, suggesting that these aggregates contained a high quotient of cross-β-structures. At a 5-fold molar excess of CLR01, only small amorphous structures were apparent, in agreement with a strong inhibition of the ThT fluorescence increase (Fig. 1, P–T). Previously, CLR01 was shown not only to inhibit the aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins, such as Aβ40, Aβ42 (19Sinha S. Lopes D.H. Du Z. Pang E.S. Shanmugam A. Lomakin A. Talbiersky P.

Here, we asked whether it could also dissociate pre-formed fibrils or other aggregates of SOD1. To answer the question, we added a 10-fold excess of CLR01 and an equimolar concentration of ThT to WT SOD1 or G93A-SOD1 that had been previously agitated at 37 °C for 48 h and then left at room temperature for 6 months. The mixtures were incubated without agitation at 37 °C for 26 days, and ThT fluorescence was measured every 24 h. Aliquots from each reaction were taken on days 0, 11, and 26 for morphological examination by EM. The initial ThT fluorescence in the WT SOD1 reactions was ~20% higher than in the G93A-SOD1 reactions (Fig. 2). In both cases, the ThT fluorescence gradually decreased to about 50% of the original fluorescence value after ~20 days, at which point the value did not change anymore, suggesting that CLR01 dissociated some but not all of the SOD1 aggregates. The morphological examination showed that at all time points, a mixture of fibrils and large and small amorphous aggregates was present, which did not show a clear trend of change during the experiment, possibly due to the high morphological variability of the aggregates. This disagreement between the change observed by ThT but not by EM suggests that CLR01 can disrupt some but not all of the cross-β-structure of pre-formed SOD1 fibrils and/or amorphous aggregates under the experimental conditions we used. SOD1 contains 11 Lys residues (12 in the E21K variant), each of which is a potential binding site for CLR01. Previous studies with amyloid β-protein (19Sinha S. Lopes D.H. Du Z. Pang E.S.

Thus, we asked whether a preferred binding site for CLR01 also existed in SOD1. To answer the question, we used native mass spectrometry (MS) with electrospray ionization (ESI). These experiments showed that when SOD1 and CLR01 were mixed at a 1:1 ratio, the 1:1 complex was the predominant CLR01-bound stoichiometry; from the summed intensities of the peaks in the native ESI mass spectrum (Fig. 3A), the relative ratios of the apo-, 1-ligand bound, and 2-ligand bound forms were 0.55:0.40:0.05. However, this does not preclude multiple binding sites for CLR01 on SOD1. By measuring the normalized signal intensities for each such complex, equilibrium dissociation constants were calculated using a Scatchard plot, as was done previously for α-synuclein (23Acharya S.

The first and second dissociation constants were measured to be 2.93 and 44.9 μm, respectively. To elucidate the main binding site(s) of CLR01 on SOD1, we used tandem MS (MS/MS) or “top-down” MS of the protein–ligand complex. Using electron capture dissociation (ECD), covalent backbone bonds of the polypeptide could be cleaved, whereas noncovalent forces holding the ligand bound to the macromolecule were maintained. ECD-MS/MS of protein–ligand complexes yielded product ions from dissociation of the protein chain, some of which were still bound to the ligand (Table S1). The sequence of these ligand-bound fragments was mapped onto the full-length protein sequence to determine the ligand-binding region(s). The 12+-charged ion for the 1:1 SOD1–CLR01 complex was analyzed using this approach; protein fragments of the c- (retaining the N terminus) and z- (retaining the C terminus) product-ion series were detected. Some product ions from dissociation of the polypeptide backbone corresponded to unbound protein, whereas other product ions retained binding to CLR01 (Fig. 3B, dark lines). The data were interpreted in a similar fashion as in our previous work (19Sinha S. Lopes D.H. Du Z. Pang E.S. Shanmugam A. Lomakin A. Talbiersky P. Tennstaedt A. McDaniel K. Bakshi R. Kuo P.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2908302178,"Cryptosporidium spp are important intestinal protozoan parasites that cause diarrhea in humans, domestic and wild animals. Its infection remains a main public health concern however, the epidemics in human being is still unclear, particularly in developing countries. There are several factors that may enhance the spreading of this parasite in human population especially in young children.A questionnaire was designed to obtain the demographic and clinical data from the participants. A total of 425 stool samples were collected from suspected children (aged 3-10 years) in different hospitals and villages. The initial screening was performed with modified Ziehl Neelsen (mZN) staining technique followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Several potential risk factors were also assessed through the obtained information from suspected individuals.Out of all 425 collected samples, 127 were observed positive by mZN with a prevalence of 29.88% (127/425). The 127 mZN positive samples together with 50 mZN negative samples were processed for molecular analysis through PCR assay. Among them, 71 out of 127 mZN positive samples and 4 out of 50 mZN negative samples were found positive by PCR. The molecular analysis showed that Cryptosporidium parvum was the main cause of infection in children. The results revealed that individuals exposed to diarrhea were more likely to be infected with Cryptosporidium infection while several environmental factors may also play a key role in spreading of this parasite.The current high prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection may be due to the lack of awareness and routine based testing in identification of this parasite in District Buner. Further studies are required to determine the importance of Cryptosporidium infection in this area as well as across the country and to find out the possible risk factors that may be associated with the occurrence of this protozoan. There is, however, an urgent need for laboratory-based observational studies to develop a more dynamic estimate of the cryptosporidial disease burden in the region."
https://openalex.org/W2907835842,"Researchers who analyze data within the framework of null hypothesis significance testing must choose a critical “alpha” level, α, to use as a cutoff for deciding whether a given set of data demonstrates the presence of a particular effect. In most fields, α = 0.05 has traditionally been used as the standard cutoff. Many researchers have recently argued for a change to a more stringent evidence cutoff such as α = 0.01, 0.005, or 0.001, noting that this change would tend to reduce the rate of false positives, which are of growing concern in many research areas. Other researchers oppose this proposed change, however, because it would correspondingly tend to increase the rate of false negatives. We show how a simple statistical model can be used to explore the quantitative tradeoff between reducing false positives and increasing false negatives. In particular, the model shows how the optimal α level depends on numerous characteristics of the research area, and it reveals that although α = 0.05 would indeed be approximately the optimal value in some realistic situations, the optimal α could actually be substantially larger or smaller in other situations. The importance of the model lies in making it clear what characteristics of the research area have to be specified to make a principled argument for using one α level rather than another, and the model thereby provides a blueprint for researchers seeking to justify a particular α level."
https://openalex.org/W2906924721,"The growing grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) population in the Baltic Sea has created conflicts with local fisheries, comparable to similar emerging problems worldwide. Adequate information on the foraging habits is a requirement for responsible management of the seal population. We investigated the applicability of available dietary assessment methods by comparing morphological analysis and DNA metabarcoding of gut contents (short-term diet; n = 129/125 seals, respectively), and tissue chemical markers i.e. fatty acid (FA) profiles of blubber and stable isotopes (SIs) of liver and muscle (mid- or long-term diet; n = 108 seals for the FA and SI markers). The methods provided complementary information. Short-term methods indicated prey species and revealed dietary differences between age groups and areas but for limited time period. In the central Baltic, herring was the main prey, while in the Gulf of Finland percid and cyprinid species together comprised the largest part of the diet. Perch was also an important prey in the western Baltic Proper. The DNA analysis provided firm identification of many prey species, which were neglected or identified only at species group level by morphological analysis. Liver SIs distinguished spatial foraging patterns and identified potentially migrated individuals, whereas blubber FAs distinguished individuals frequently utilizing certain types of prey. Tissue chemical markers of adult males suggested specialized feeding to certain areas and prey, which suggest that these individuals are especially prone to cause economic losses for fisheries. We recommend combined analyses of gut contents and tissue chemical markers as dietary monitoring methodology of aquatic top predators to support an optimal ecosystem-based management."
https://openalex.org/W2907459754,"In many parts of the world the damaging potato late blight pathogen, Phytophthora infestans, is spread as a succession of clonal lineages. The discrimination of genetic diversity within such evolving populations provides insights into the processes generating novel lineages and the pathways and drivers of pathogen evolution and dissemination at local and global scales. This knowledge, in turn, helps optimise management practices. Here we combine two key methods for dissecting mitochondrial and nuclear diversity and resolve intra and inter-lineage diversity of over 100 P. infestans isolates representative of key clonal lineages found globally. A novel set of PCR primers that amplify five target regions are provided for mitochondrial DNA sequence analysis. These five loci increased the number of mtDNA haplotypes resolved from four with the PCR RFLP method to 37 (17, 6, 8 and 4 for Ia, Ib, IIa, and IIb haplotypes, respectively, plus 2 Herb-1 haplotypes). As with the PCR RFLP method, two main lineages, I and II were defined. Group I contained 25 mtDNA haplotypes that grouped broadly according to the Ia and Ib types and resolved several sub-clades amongst the global sample. Group II comprised two distinct clusters with four haplotypes corresponding to the RFLP type IIb and eight haplotypes resolved within type IIa. The 12-plex SSR assay revealed 90 multilocus genotypes providing accurate discrimination of dominant clonal lineages and other genetically diverse isolates. Some association of genetic diversity and geographic region of contemporary isolates was observed; US and Mexican isolates formed a loose grouping, distinct from isolates from Europe, South America and other regions. Diversity within clonal lineages was observed that varied according to the age of the clone. In combination, these fine-scale nuclear and maternally inherited mitochondrial markers enabled a greater level of discrimination among isolates than previously available and provided complementary perspectives on evolutionary questions relating to the diversity, phylogeography and the origins and spread of clonal lineages of P. infestans."
https://openalex.org/W2906841807,"Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling is critical in renal development and disease. In animal models of chronic kidney disease (CKD), re-activation of BMP signaling is reported to be protective by promoting renal repair and regeneration. Clinical use of recombinant BMPs, however, requires harmful doses to achieve efficacy and is costly because of BMPs' complex synthesis. Therefore, alternative strategies are needed to harness the beneficial effects of BMP signaling in CKD. Key aspects of the BMP signaling pathway can be regulated by both extracellular and intracellular molecules. In particular, secreted proteins like noggin and chordin inhibit BMP activity, whereas kielin/chordin-like proteins (KCP) enhance it and attenuate kidney fibrosis or CKD. Clinical development of KCP, however, is precluded by its size and complexity. Therefore, we propose an alternative strategy to enhance BMP signaling by using small molecules, which are simpler to synthesize and more cost-effective. To address our objective, here we developed a small-molecule high-throughput screen (HTS) with human renal cells having an integrated luciferase construct highly responsive to BMPs. We demonstrate the activity of a potent benzoxazole compound, sb4, that rapidly stimulated BMP signaling in these cells. Activation of BMP signaling by sb4 increased the phosphorylation of key second messengers (SMAD-1/5/9) and also increased expression of direct target genes (inhibitors of DNA binding, Id1 and Id3) in canonical BMP signaling. Our results underscore the feasibility of utilizing HTS to identify compounds that mimic key downstream events of BMP signaling in renal cells and have yielded a lead BMP agonist."
https://openalex.org/W2907176640,"The coordination of the human musculoskeletal system is deeply influenced by its redundant structure, in both kinematic and dynamic terms. Noticing a lack of a relevant, thorough treatment in the literature, we formally address the issue in order to understand and quantify factors affecting the motor coordination. We employed well-established techniques from linear algebra and projection operators to extend the underlying kinematic and dynamic relations by modeling the redundancy effects in null space. We distinguish three types of operational spaces, namely task, joint and muscle space, which are directly associated with the physiological factors of the system. A method for consistently quantifying the redundancy on multiple levels in the entire space of feasible solutions is also presented. We evaluate the proposed muscle space projection on segmental level reflexes and the computation of the feasible muscle forces for arbitrary movements. The former proves to be a convenient representation for interfacing with segmental level models or implementing controllers for tendon driven robots, while the latter enables the identification of force variability and correlations between muscle groups, attributed to the system's redundancy. Furthermore, the usefulness of the proposed framework is demonstrated in the context of estimating the bounds of the joint reaction loads, where we show that misinterpretation of the results is possible if the null space forces are ignored. This work presents a theoretical analysis of the redundancy problem, facilitating application in a broad range of fields related to motor coordination, as it provides the groundwork for null space characterization. The proposed framework rigorously accounts for the effects of kinematic and dynamic redundancy, incorporating it directly into the underlying equations using the notion of null space projection, leading to a complete description of the system."

Our data revealed that higher NO3- concentrations and δ15N-NO3- values were observed in the upper waters of the coastal areas near the Pearl River Estuary (PRE). The Bayesian stable isotope mixing model was used to calculated the proportion of nitrate sources, the results indicated that the nitrate in the upper waters of the coastal areas near PRE were mainly influenced by manure and sewage (63%), atmospheric deposition (19%), soil organic nitrogen (12%) and reduced N fertilizer (6%). For the upper waters of the outer areas, low NO3- concentrations and δ15N-NO3- values, but high δ18O-NO3- values, reflected that NO3- was mainly influenced by Kuroshio water intrusion (60%), atmospheric deposition (32%) and nitrogen fixation/nitrification (8%). Complex processes were found in bottom waters. Nitrification and phytoplankton assimilation may be responsible for the higher nitrate concentrations and δ15N-NO3- values. Our study, therefore, utilizes the nitrate dual isotope to help illustrate the spatial variations in nitrate sources and complex nitrogen cycles in the NSCS."
https://openalex.org/W2907096890,"Plant cell walls are composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, collectively known as lignocellulose. Microorganisms degrade lignocellulose to liberate sugars to meet metabolic demands. Using a metagenomic sequencing approach, we previously demonstrated that the microbiome of the North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) is replete with genes that could encode lignocellulose-degrading enzymes. Here, we report the identification, synthesis and partial characterization of four novel genes from the porcupine microbiome encoding putative lignocellulose-degrading enzymes: β-glucosidase, α-L-arabinofuranosidase, β-xylosidase, and endo-1,4-β-xylanase. These genes were identified via conserved catalytic domains associated with cellulose- and hemicellulose-degradation. Phylogenetic trees were created for each of these putative enzymes to depict genetic relatedness to known enzymes. Candidate genes were synthesized and cloned into plasmid expression vectors for inducible protein expression and secretion. The putative β-glucosidase fusion protein was efficiently secreted but did not permit Escherichia coli (E. coli) to use cellobiose as a sole carbon source, nor did the affinity purified enzyme cleave p-Nitrophenyl β-D-glucopyranoside (p-NPG) substrate in vitro over a range of physiological pH levels (pH 5–7). The putative hemicellulose-degrading β-xylosidase and α-L-arabinofuranosidase enzymes also lacked in vitro enzyme activity, but the affinity purified endo-1,4-β-xylanase protein cleaved a 6-chloro-4-methylumbelliferyl xylobioside substrate in acidic and neutral conditions, with maximal activity at pH 7. At this optimal pH, KM, Vmax, and kcat were determined to be 32.005 ± 4.72 μM, 1.16x10-5 ± 3.55x10-7 M/s, and 94.72 s-1, respectively. Thus, our pipeline enabled successful identification and characterization of a novel hemicellulose-degrading enzyme from the porcupine microbiome. Progress towards the goal of introducing a complete lignocellulose-degradation pathway into E. coli will be accelerated by combining synthetic metagenomic approaches with functional metagenomic library screening, which can identify novel enzymes unrelated to those found in available databases."

CCMP activities included training and supervision, ensuring no stock-outs of malaria tests and drugs, analysing verified surveillance data, stratifying areas based on risk factors, and appointing alternative providers to underserved areas. Composite risk scores were calculated for each sub-centre using principal component analysis. Post-pre changes (2013-2015 versus 2011-2012) for annual blood examination rates (ABER) and annual parasite incidence (API) across intervention and control groups were assessed using difference-in-difference (DID) estimates, adjusted for malaria transmission risk.In the intervention sub-centres, the mean increase in ABER was 6.41 tests/sub-centre (95%CI 4.69, 8.14; p<0.01) and in API was 9.2 cases diagnosed/sub-centre (95%CI 5.18, 13.21; p<0.01). The control sub-centres reported lower increases in ABER (2.84 [95%CI 0.35, 5.34]; p<0.05) and API (3.68 [95%CI 0.45, 6.90]; p<0.05). The control-adjusted post-pre changes in API showed that 5.52 more cases (95%CI 0.34, 10.70; p<0.05) were diagnosed, and a 3.6 more cases (95%CI 0.58, 6.56; p<0.05) were tested per sub-centre in the intervention versus control areas. Larger differences in post-pre changes in API between intervention and control sub-centres were registered in the higher transmission-risk areas compared with the lower risk areas. All the changes were statistically significant.Intensive intervention activities targeted at improved access to malaria diagnosis and treatment produced a substantial increase in blood examination and case notification, especially in inaccessible, hard-to-reach pockets. CCMP provides insights into how to achieve universal coverage of malaria services through a routine, state-run programme."
https://openalex.org/W2906927383,"Road traffic injuries are the ninth cause of death across all age groups, globally (WHO, 2015). Many road traffic crashes are caused by Driving Under the Influence (DUI) of alcohol by persons who have previously had their license suspended for the same reason. The aim of this study was to identify specific risk factors and personality characteristics in repeat offenders. The sample was comprised of 260 subjects who were not repeat DUI offenders (DUI-NR), but had a single license suspension between 2010 and 2011; and 97 repeat offenders who received at least two DUI convictions within a period of 5 years. At the time of their first driving license suspension, participants provided their blood alcohol content (BAC) and completed a valid MMPI-2 test. ANOVA and MANOVAs were performed to determine whether there were significant differences in BAC and MMPI-2 profiles between DUI-NR and DUI-R participants and a logistic regression was run to identify whether BAC at the time of the first suspension and specific personality features could predict recidivism. A two-step cluster analysis was run to identify recidivist typologies. Results showed that, relative to DUI-NR participants, DUI-R participants had higher BAC at the time of their first conviction and more problematic MMPI-2 profiles, despite the presence of social desirability responding. The best predictors of recidivism were BAC and the scales of Lie (L), Correction (K), Psychopathic Deviate (4-Pd), Hypomania (9-Ma), and Low Self-Esteem (LSE). Two-step cluster analyses identified two recidivist profiles, according to 32 selected MMPI-2 validity, clinical, content, supplementary, and PSY-5 scales. Comparisons with previous research are discussed and ideas for further study are generated."
https://openalex.org/W2907006897,"Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is the most common inherited cause of kidney failure and currently has limited treatment options. Increasing water intake reduces renal cyst growth in the pck rat (a genetic ortholog of autosomal recessive PKD) but it is not clear if this beneficial effect is present in other models of PKD. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that high water intake (HWI) reduces the progression of cystic renal disease in Lewis polycystic kidney (LPK) rats (a genetic ortholog of human nephronophthisis-9). Groups of female and male LPK (n = 8-10 per group) and Lewis (n = 4 per group) rats received water ad libitum supplemented with or without 5% glucose [to simulate HWI or normal water intake (NWI) respectively] from postnatal weeks 3 to 16. Water intake increased ~1.3-fold in the LPK+HWI group compared to LPK+NWI rats between weeks 3 to 10 but the differences were not significant at later timepoints. In LPK rats, HWI reduced the increases in the kidney to body weight ratio by 54% at week 10 and by 42% at week 16 compared to NWI (both p<0.01). The reduction in kidney enlargement was accompanied by decreases in the percentage renal cyst area, percentage renal interstitial collagen and proteinuria (all p<0.05). At week 16, HWI reduced systolic blood pressure and the heart to body to weight ratio by 16% and 21% respectively in males LPK rats (both p<0.01). In conclusion, a modest increase in water intake during the early phase of disease was sufficient to attenuate renal cystic disease in LPK rats, with secondary benefits on hypertension and cardiovascular disease. These data provide further preclinical evidence that increased water intake is a potential intervention in cystic renal diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2908207416,"Organisms can have large effects on the physical properties of the habitats where they live. For example, measurements in laboratory stream microcosms have shown that the presence of silk net-spinning insect larvae (Trichoptera: Hydropsychidae) can increase the shear force required to initiate movement of riverbed sediments. Few studies, however, have moved beyond laboratory settings to quantify the engineering impacts of aquatic insects under more complex field conditions. To bridge the gap between small-scale laboratory experiments and natural stream ecosystems, we conducted experiments in large (50 m2) outdoor river channels where net-spinning aquatic insects were manipulated in sediment patches that were 5 to 25 times larger than in previous studies. We tested whether larvae of two caddisfly species (Arctopsyche californica and Ceratopsyche oslari) influenced the stability of gravel during simulated floods when alone in monoculture and together in polyculture. On average, populations of caddisflies increased the critical shear stress required to initiate sediment movement by 20% compared to treatments without caddisflies. Per capita effects of caddisflies on sediment stability were similar between previous laboratory studies and this field experiment, and Arctopsyche had a larger per capita effect than Ceratopsyche, perhaps because of its larger size and stronger silk. Contrary to prior laboratory flume results, the effects of the two species on critical shear stress when together were similar to the additive expectation of both species when alone, but effects of the two species together were higher than the additive expectation when we accounted for density. Comparisons of total population and per capita effects suggest that caddisfly density, identity, and coexisting species likely have effects on the magnitude of caddisfly impacts on critical shear stress. Our findings imply that consideration of both the abundances and traits of ecosystem engineers is needed to describe and model their effects on sediment mobility."

https://openalex.org/W2906919777,"The development of positive attitudes toward science is one of the main priorities in science education. However, there is a lack of reliable and valid instruments to measure Spanish-speaking elementary students' attitudes towards school science. In this study, the translation and validation of the Spanish School-Science Attitude Survey (S-SSAS) is reported. The instrument was administered to 643 students enrolled in 3rd to 6th elementary grades. Psychometric evaluation of the S-SSAS provided sound evidence for validity (face, content, construct and criterion) and reliability (internal consistency and temporal stability). Content validity was confirmed through a panel of experts who reached great consensus in linking items to attitudinal constructs, with an ICC = .956. Think-aloud interviews confirmed that students have easily understood and correctly interpreted all items included, thus providing face validity for the S-SSAS. Consistent with theoretical expectations, predictive validity ranged between -.334 to 543 and concurrent validity was examined through S-SSAS correlation with two external measures of conceptual convergence that ranged from.301 to .560, thus confirming criterion validity. Construct validity was assessed by obtaining consistent results with the original scale in terms of reporting no statistically significant differences in attitudinal profiles towards school science between girls and boys and between students from urban and rural schools. Cronbach αfor the entire scale was .704, with item-total correlation ranging from .243 to .560, which reports acceptable internal consistency. Temporal stability with a 10-days span was good, with ICC = .873 and r = .464-790. Taken together, these results indicate that the Spanish single-items School-Science Attitude Survey is easy to administer and equally interpreted by both girls and boys enrolled in rural and urban elementary schools, thus being a valid and reliable instrument for measuring attitudes towards school science."
https://openalex.org/W2907077399,"Dysregulated signaling via the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-family is believed to contribute to the progression of a diverse array of cancers. The most common variant of EGFR is EGFRvIII, which results from a consistent and tumor-specific in-frame deletion of exons 2–7 of the EGFR gene. This deletion generates a novel glycine at the junction and leads to constitutive ligand-independent activity. This junction forms a novel shared tumor neo-antigen with demonstrated immunogenicity in both mice and humans. A 21-amino acid peptide spanning the junctional region was selected, and then one or five copies of this 21-AA neo-peptide were incorporated into live-attenuated Listeria monocytogenes-based vaccine vector. These vaccine candidates demonstrated efficient secretion of the recombinant protein and potent induction of EGFRvIII-specific CD8+ T cells, which prevented growth of an EGFRvIII-expressing squamous cell carcinoma. These data demonstrate the potency of a novel cancer-specific vaccine candidate that can elicit EGFRvIII-specific cellular immunity, for the purpose of targeting EGFRvIII positive cancers that are resistant to conventional therapies."

The data are taken from a population-based retrospective cohort study on cases of TB/HIV co-infection from 2009 to 2013 in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Sociodemographic, epidemiological and clinical variables were analyzed. Relative risk (RR) estimates for hospitalization and death were determined by regression models. There were 2,419 co-infection cases, of which 1,527 (63.1%) corresponded to hospitalizations, and 662 (27.4%) to death. The occurrence of hospitalization was associated with ≤ 7 years of schooling (RR = 3.47, 95%CI: 1.97-6.29), 8-11 years of schooling (RR = 2.56, 95%CI: 1.44-4.69), place of origin-district health authorities Northwest/Humaitá/Navegantes/Ilhas (RR = 2.01, 95%CI: 1.44-2.82), type of entry into the surveillance system as in cases of reentry after withdrawal (RR = 1,35, 95%CI: 1.07-1.70), closure in surveillance as in withdrawal of treatment (RR = 1.47, 95%CI: 1.18-1.83) and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (RR = 3.94, 95%CI: 1.97-8.81). The occurrence of death was associated with age (RR = 1.07, 95%CI: 1,01-1,14), ≤ 7 years of schooling (RR = 3.94, 95%CI: 2.26-7.09), 8-11 years of schooling (RR = 2.84, 95%CI: 1.61-5.16), place of origin-district health authorities Baltazar (RR = 2.05, 95%CI: 1.48-2.86), type of entry in the surveillance system as cases of re-entry after withdrawal (RR = 1.53, 95%CI: 1.22-1.91), relapse (RR = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.03-1.73). The occurrence of hospitalizations and deaths is high among co-infected patients.

Structural analysis was used to identify positions for cysteine introduction to maximize rHSA stability and formation of the conjugated product without affecting hFcRn binding. The thiol rHSA variants exhibited up to 95% monomeric stability over 24 months and retained hFcRn engagement compared with a WT unconjugated control demonstrated by Biolayer Interferometry. The additional cysteines were further introduced into a panel of rHSA variants engineered with different affinities for hFcRn. After conjugation with three Alexa Fluor 680 (AF680) fluorophores, hFcRn binding was similar to that of the original triple-thiol nonconjugated rHSA variants (0.88 and 0.25 μm for WT albumin with or without 3xAF680 respectively, and 0.04 and 0.02 μm for a high hFcRn–binding variant with or without 3xAF680, respectively).

Logistic regression showed patients with bone or lung metastases had greater odds of having brain metastases at diagnosis. Median OS for HCCBM was 2.40 months. Cox regression revealed unmarried and bone metastases patients suffered significantly shorter survival time. A nomogram was developed with internal validation concordance index of 0.639.This study provided population-based estimates of the incidence and prognosis for HCCBM patients.

https://openalex.org/W2908328933,"Introduction Physical activity is positively associated with children’s classroom behaviour. However, less is known about how different types of physical activity contribute to these outcomes. This study examines associations between sport participation and classroom behaviour among primary school-aged children. Methods Parents of 568 children aged 9–11 years reported child sport participation and classroom behaviour outcomes (school functioning, inattention, classroom behaviour (fidgetiness), acting without thinking and poor concentration). Sport participation included: duration (hours/week) and type (individual; team; team and individual). Regression analyses assessed associations between sport participation and classroom behaviour outcomes. Analyses adjusted for maternal education, and objectively-measured overall physical activity, and accounted for clustering by recruitment centre. Sex differences in associations were explored as a secondary aim. Results In comparison to children who did not participate in sport, children who participated in sport displayed less inattention/hyperactivity (individual sport: B = -1.00;95%CI:-1.90, -0.00; team sport:-0.88;95%CI:-1.73, -0.03) and less acting without thinking (individual sport: OR = 0.35;95%CI:0.13,0.98), after adjusting for overall physical activity. There were no sex differences in associations. Conclusions Findings indicated sport participation, one form of physical activity, was associated with less inattention/hyperactivity and acting without thinking, over and above the influence of overall physical activity levels. Parents may consider sport as one way to contribute to their child’s overall physical activity levels, although the impact of organised sport on classroom behaviour is modest at best."
https://openalex.org/W2906927973,"The successful inhibition of sexual thoughts, desires, and behaviors represents an essential ability for adequate functioning in our daily life. Evidence derived from lesion studies indicates a link between sexual inhibition and the general ability for behavioral and cognitive control. This is further supported by the high comorbidity of sexual compulsivity with other inhibition-related disorders. Here, we aimed at investigating whether sexual and general inhibition recruit overlapping or distinct neural correlates in the brain. Furthermore, we investigated the specificity of two different kinds of sexual inhibition: inhibition of sexually driven motor responses and inhibition of sexual incoming information. To this end, 22 healthy participants underwent functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) while performing a task requiring general response inhibition (Go/No-go), as well as cognitive and motivational sexual inhibition (Negative Affective Priming and Approach-Avoidance task). Our within-subject within-session design enabled the direct statistical comparison between general and sexual inhibitory mechanisms. The general inhibition task recruited mainly prefrontal and insular regions, replicating previous findings. In contrast, the two types of sexual inhibition activated both common and distinct neural networks. Whereas cognitive sexual inhibition engaged the inferior frontal gyrus, the orbitofrontal cortex and the fusiform gyrus, motivational sexual inhibition was characterized by a hypoactivation in the anterolateral prefrontal cortex. Both types of sexual inhibition recruited the inferior frontal gyrus and the inferotemporal cortex. However, the activity of the inferior frontal gyrus did not correlate with behavioral inhibitory scores. These results support the hypothesis of inhibitory processing being an emergent property of a functional network."

Studies in several yeast species have shown that the phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) is synthesized from CDP-diacylglycerol and serine, a route that is different from its synthesis in mammalian cells, involving a base-exchange reaction from preexisting phospholipids. Fungal-specific PS synthesis has been shown to play an important role in fungal virulence and has been proposed as an attractive drug target. However, PS synthase, which catalyzes this reaction, has not been studied in the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans.

Heterologous expression of Cn CHO1 in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae cho1Δ mutant rescued the mutant’s growth defect in the absence of ethanolamine supplementation. Moreover, an Sc cho1Δ mutant expressing Cn CHO1 had PS synthase activity, confirming that the Cn CHO1 encodes PS synthase. We also found that PS synthase in C. neoformans is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and that it is essential for mitochondrial function and cell viability.

However, both treatment courses have serious drawbacks: amphotericin B produces toxic side effects, whereas triazoles are fungistatic, which can promote the emergence of drug resistance.

In mammals and some parasites (e.g. Trypanosoma brucei), PS is generated by exchanging serine for choline in PC and for ethanolamine in PE by the activity of PS synthases PSS1 and PSS2, respectively (12Farine L.

Thus far, the role of Cho1 has been investigated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans. The S. cerevisiae cho1 mutant (Sc cho1Δ) is viable, but because it is unable to synthesize PS, which serves as a substrate for the de novo synthesis of PE and PC, the Sc cho1Δ mutant can only grow if ethanolamine or choline is exogenously supplied, enabling PE and PC synthesis via the Kennedy pathway (Fig. 1) (17Carman G.M.

The Sc CHO1 gene expression is negatively regulated by inositol and choline availability (18Kelley M.J. Bailis A.M. Henry S.A. Carman G.M. Regulation of phospholipid biosynthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by inositol. Inositol is an inhibitor of phosphatidylserine synthase activity.J. Biol.

In addition, the Ca cho1Δ/Δ mutant is avirulent in a mouse model of systemic candidiasis, suggesting that the PS synthase homolog in C. albicans is necessary for virulence and therefore represents a potential new drug target (15Chen Y.L. Montedonico A.E. Kauffman S. Dunlap J.R. Menn F.M. Reynolds T.B. Phosphatidylserine synthase and phosphatidylserine decarboxylase are essential for cell wall integrity and virulence in Candida albicans.Mol.

However, the function and importance of PS synthase in C. neoformans development and pathogenesis have not been analyzed yet. Our previous study revealed that C. neoformans lipid flippase, which translocates certain phospholipids (PS and PE) from the exocytoplasmic leaflet to the cytoplasmic leaflet to maintain the asymmetrical distribution of phospholipids, is essential for virulence in a murine model of cryptococcosis. It is also required for the inherent resistance of this fungus to echinocandin drugs. Mutants of the lipid flippase regulatory subunit Cdc50 showed accumulation of PS on the outer layer of the plasma membrane, were hypersensitive to macrophage killing, and showed reduced virulence (19Huang W. Liao G. Baker G.M. Wang Y. Lau R. Paderu P. Perlin D.S. Xue C. Lipid flippase subunit Cdc50 mediates drug resistance and virulence in Cryptococcus neoformans.MBio. 2016; 7 (27165800): e00478Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that loss of Cdc50 prevents PS translocation, leading to increased PS exposure on the cell surface, which may promote macrophage recognition and killing of such cells, because PS accumulation on the cell surface has been shown to serve as a phagocytic signal for macrophages (20Shor E. Wang Y. Perlin D.S. Xue C. Cryptococcus flips its lid-membrane phospholipid asymmetry modulates antifungal drug resistance and virulence.Microb. Cell. 2016; 3 (28357373): 358-36010.15698/mic2016.08.521Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The overall reduced phospholipid level in the cdc50Δ mutant was also observed in a separate study (21Hu G. Caza M. Bakkeren E. Kretschmer M. Bairwa G. Reiner E. Kronstad J. A P4-ATPase subunit of the Cdc50 family plays a role in iron acquisition and virulence in Cryptococcus neoformans.Cell Microbiol. 2017; 19: e1271810.1111/cmi.12718Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in further exploring the role of PS in fungal development and virulence. In this study, we characterized the only Cho1 homolog in C. neoformans (Cn Cho1) and confirmed that it functions as a PS synthase. We were unable to generate a deletion mutant of Cn CHO1, revealing that Cn Cho1 is essential for C. neoformans viability, despite the presence of an active Kennedy pathway in this fungus. We further investigated the mechanism of Cn Cho1 essentiality and revealed that PS is likely an essential phospholipid for this fungus. The essentiality of the fungal-specific PS synthase in C. neoformans warrants further investigation of this enzyme as a potential drug target. Our previous study showed that deletion of the regulatory subunit of the lipid flippase Cdc50 leads to the accumulation of PS on the outer leaflet of the bilayer membrane in Cryptococcus, which appears to contribute to the loss of fungal virulence (19Huang W. Liao G. Baker G.M. Wang Y. Lau R. Paderu P. Perlin D.S. Xue C. Lipid flippase subunit Cdc50 mediates drug resistance and virulence in Cryptococcus neoformans.MBio. 2016; 7 (27165800): e00478Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tried to generate a mutant strain lacking PS to better understand the role of PS in fungal virulence. This led us to identify the only homolog of the S. cerevisiae PS synthase Cho1 protein. The C. neoformans Cho1 (Cn Cho1) protein shares high amino acid sequence identity with the known PS synthases in S. cerevisiae (Sc Cho1) and C. albicans (Ca Cho1). All of them share the conserved sequence of CDP-diacylglycerol–serine O-phosphatidyltransferase (DGX2ARX7,8GX3DX3D). Protein secondary structure analysis also indicated that all three are integral membrane proteins with multiple transmembrane domains, albeit with some differences in the number and the topology of potential transmembrane regions (Fig. 2). To confirm the localization of Cn Cho1 protein in C. neoformans, we generated a Cn Cho1:mCherry fusion construct and expressed this fusion protein in C. neoformans WT H99. Our results showed that the fluorescent signal mostly localized to the ER membrane (Fig. 3A and Fig. S1). We then purified the membrane fraction by centrifugation and treated it with either PBS, Triton X-100, or 1 m NaCl to determine whether Cn Cho1 is an integral membrane protein or a membrane-binding protein (Fig. 3B). Our results clearly showed that Cn Cho1 was solubilized by Triton X-100, but not by high salt, indicating that it is an integral membrane protein. To confirm the Cn Cho1 protein is a PS synthase, we expressed Cn CHO1 gene in a S. cerevisiae strain carrying a deletion of Sc CHO1 (Sc cho1Δ). As expected, the Sc cho1Δ mutant was an ethanolamine auxotroph and could not grow on SC medium lacking ethanolamine (Fig. 4A). We observed that heterologous expression of Cn CHO1 in this mutant background fully complemented its growth defect, indicating that Cn CHO1 is likely a PS synthase (Fig. 4A). We then measured the PS synthase activity in cell lysates directly using [3-3H]serine as described previously (16Bae-Lee M.S. Carman G.M. Phosphatidylserine synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Our results showed that the Sc cho1Δ mutant completely lacked PS synthase activity and that expressing Cn CHO1 in this mutant largely restored its PS synthase activity (Fig. 4B), supporting the conclusion that Cn Cho1 has PS synthase activity. In S. cerevisiae, extracellular inositol negatively regulates Sc CHO1 expression (18Kelley M.J. Bailis A.M. Henry S.A. Carman G.M. Regulation of phospholipid biosynthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by inositol. Inositol is an inhibitor of phosphatidylserine synthase activity.J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263 (2848023): 18078-18085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we examined Cn CHO1 gene expression in the presence of various inositol concentrations to determine whether it is also regulated by inositol. Indeed, our results indicated that Cn CHO1 transcription is repressed by a high level of inositol and induced or derepressed as the inositol level decreases (Fig. 4C). Although we have not been able to identify C. neoformans homologs of S. cerevisiae inositol-dependent transcriptional regulators, our results indicate that the Cn CHO1 gene is regulated by inositol similarly to Sc CHO1. To examine the role of PS synthase in C. neoformans, we attempted to generate a deletion mutant for Cn CHO1 in the H99 background, but were unsuccessful despite the extensive effort of screening over 200 transformants (data not shown). We then deleted one allele of Cn CHO1 from a diploid C. neoformans strain AI187 (24Idnurm A. A tetrad analysis of the basidiomycete fungus Cryptococcus neoformans.Genetics. 2010; 185 (20157004): 153-16310.1534/genetics.109.113027Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), replacing it with a neomycin (NEO) resistance cassette (Fig. 5A). The heterozygous Cn CHO1/cho1Δ strain was viable and grew normally on YPD. We incubated the strain on a V8 mating medium to induce mating and sporulation, dissected over 20 spores, and patched them on YPD with or without G418. All of the tested spores grew on YPD, but none of them grew on YPD with G418, suggesting that all viable spores contain the WT Cn CHO1 allele (Fig. 5C) and that Cn Cho1 is likely essential for fungal viability. We also repeated the experiment by supplementing the medium with 1 mm ethanolamine or 1 mm choline, but we still did not obtain any viable haploid Cn cho1Δ strains (data not shown). To better understand the potential essentiality of Cn Cho1, we used homologous recombination to replace the Cn CHO1 native promoter with an inducible CTR4 promoter (PCTR4-CHO1). The activity of the CTR4 promoter can be suppressed by the addition of CuSO4 and ascorbic acid and induced by the addition of the copper chelator bathocuproinedisulfonic acid (BCS) (25Ory J.J. Griffith C.L. Doering T.L.

First, we tested cell growth by adding 25 μm CuSO4 that has been shown to significantly suppress the CTR4 promoter in previous studies (25Ory J.J. Griffith C.L. Doering T.L. An efficiently regulated promoter system for Cryptococcus neoformans utilizing the CTR4 promoter.Yeast. 2004; 21 (15334556): 919-92610.1002/yea.1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Liu T.B. Xue C. Fbp1-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome pathway controls Cryptococcus neoformans virulence by regulating fungal intracellular growth in macrophages.Infect. Immun. 2014; 82 (24478071): 557-56810.1128/IAI.00994-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, we did not observe a significant growth defect between WT and the PCTR4-CHO1 strain (Fig. S3). By testing the growth assay using media containing different CuSO4 concentrations, we found that when 1 mm CuSO4 was used, the strain grew very poorly (Fig. 6, B and C). As a control, WT strain treated with 1 mm CuSO4 only showed modest growth defect (Fig. 6D), which is consistent with a previous report using such a CuSO4 concentration (27Ding C. Festa R.A. Chen Y.L. Espart A. Palacios Ò. Espín J. Capdevila M. Atrian S. Heitman J. Thiele D.J. Cryptococcus neoformans copper detoxification machinery is critical for fungal virulence.Cell Host Microbe. 2013; 13 (23498952): 265-27610.1016/j.chom.2013.02.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). qRT-PCR analysis of CHO1 expression under the control of the CTR4 promoter showed that although 25 μm CuSO4 significantly inhibited the gene expression, adding 1 mm CuSO4 led to even further inhibition (Fig. 6A). From these results, we concluded that although 25 μm CuSO4 can significantly reduce gene expression, the remaining low level of PS synthase activity is sufficient to support fungal growth. The further gene suppression due to addition of 1 mm CuSO4 may be sufficient to abolish the Cho1 enzyme activity, leading to growth arrest. In S. cerevisiae, phospholipids such as PE and PC can be produced either by decarboxylation of PS or by utilizing ethanolamine and choline via the Kennedy pathway (Fig. 1) (17Carman G.M. Kersting M.C. Phospholipid synthesis in yeast: regulation by phosphorylation.Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82 (15052328): 62-7010.1139/o03-064Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, S. cerevisiae cho1Δ mutant is ethanolamine and choline auxotrophic and is still viable when supplemented with ethanolamine or choline. We investigated whether ethanolamine or choline could also rescue the growth arrest of the PCTR4-CHO1 strain under conditions that repressed CHO1. Interestingly, we found that adding 1 mm ethanolamine or 1 mm choline did not rescue the growth of the PCTR4-CHO1 strain under inhibition conditions (Fig. 6, B and C). One possibility for this lack of rescue is that the Kennedy pathway may be inactive in C. neoformans. To test this possibility, we monitored PE and PC production by using [14C]ethanolamine and [14C]choline in a 1D-TLC analysis. Our data showed that both C. neoformans WT H99 and S. cerevisiae WT BY4742 could produce PE and PC from ethanolamine and choline, respectively, indicating that the Kennedy pathway is active in C. neoformans (Fig. 7A). However, it remains unclear as to how much PE and PC is made using this pathway in C. neoformans. The C. neoformans mutant of the CKI1/EKI1 homolog (CNAG_04408) could still produce PE but could not produce PC (Fig. 7A), consistent with a role of this protein in the PC-producing branch of the Kennedy pathway. Another possibility for Cn CHO1 essentiality is that PS is essential for viability in C. neoformans. Although PE and PC can be produced by both the de novo PS synthetic pathway and the Kennedy pathway, PS can only be produced via PS synthase (Cho1). Therefore, we supplemented the growth medium with 1 mm lyso-PS and examined whether lyso-PS (derivative of phosphatidylserine with one fatty acid chain that rapidly incorporates into the cells and is converted to PS) could rescue the growth arrest induced by CuSO4. Indeed, we observed significant rescue of growth defect by lyso-PS but not by lyso-PE (Fig. 7B). This result indicates that PS is essential for Cryptococcus viability. Mitochondria are essential organelles as they supply the cell with energy. Furthermore, mitochondria protect the cell against reactive oxygen species (ROS), as disruption of the electron transport chain leads to an increase in ROS, which in turn damages nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids, eventually leading to cell death (28Ingavale S.S. Chang Y.C. Lee H. McClelland C.M. Leong M.L. Kwon-Chung K.J.

Because the mitochondrial membrane is composed of lipids, including PS, PE, and PC, and Sc Cho1 has been shown to play a role in mitochondria function (30Kohlwein S.D. Kuchler K. Sperka-Gottlieb C. Henry S.A. Paltauf F. Identification of mitochondrial and microsomal phosphatidylserine synthase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the gene product of the CHO1 structural gene.J.

To test our hypothesis, we first used MitoTracker Red FM to examine whether reduced levels of Cn CHO1 expression perturb mitochondrial membrane potential. The results by confocal microscopy showed that in the presence of CuSO4, PCTR4-CHO1 strain was unable to retain the MitoTracker Red FM, whereas in the presence of BCS or SC medium alone, this dye accumulated in the mitochondria (Fig. 8A and Fig. S4). To determine whether PCTR4-CHO1 strain lacked mitochondria, yeast mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was examined using DAPI. Mitochondrial DNA staining using DAPI indicated that this mitochondrial dysfunction was not due to the lack of mitochondria or damage to mtDNA, as PCTR4-CHO1 stain treated with CuSO4 still showed the mtDNA signal (Fig. 8B and Fig. S4). We also determined the cell viability after CuSO4 treatment for 0, 2, and 4 h by measuring the yeast CFU of treated cells, and we found that the majority of the cell populations were still viable (Table S2). These data support our hypothesis that Cho1 is essential to maintain healthy mitochondria by helping maintain mitochondrial membrane integrity. Perturbed mitochondrial respiratory chain may lead to increased generation of ROS (29Grant C.M. MacIver F.H. Dawes I.W. Mitochondrial function is required for resistance to oxidative stress in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.FEBS Lett. 1997; 410 (9237633): 219-22210.1016/S0014-5793(97)00592-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used the ROS indicator dye H2DCFDA to monitor ROS generation. After a 2-h incubation in the presence of CuSO4, BCS, or SC medium alone, there was no significant change in ROS generation in PCTR4-CHO1 and H99 strain. However, the ROS level significantly increased in the PCTR4-CHO1 strain as compared with H99 after 4 and 6 h of incubation (Fig. 8C). These data demonstrate that Cn Cho1 plays an important role in C. neoformans mitochondrial function, and mitochondr"

However, to date, most research has investigated emotion regulation strategies as if they occur independently from one another. The current study aims to better understand the sequential interplay between strategies by investigating how reappraisal and rumination interact to affect anger experience. After participants (N = 156) recalled a recent anger-provoking event, they were instructed to either a) reappraise the event twice, b) reappraise the event, and then ruminate about the event, c) ruminate about the event, and then reappraise the event, or d) ruminate twice about the event. The effects of the first strategy used replicated a large body of research: reappraisal was associated with a decrease in anger, but rumination was associated with no change in anger. There was a small interactive effect of the combination of the two strategies, such that those who ruminated and then reappraised showed a larger decrease in anger than those who reappraised and then ruminated. There were no other differences between groups. This suggests that the second strategy does have an effect over and beyond the first strategy, but this effect is small in size, highlighting the importance of the initial emotion regulation strategy used."

We assessed statistical interactions between the SNPs and lifestyle factors (smoking status, physical activity and body mass index). Results and conclusion Although no SNP was associated with breast cancer risk among women of European descent, we found evidence for an association among East Asians for rs1800925 (IL-13) and breast cancer risk (OR = 2.08; 95% CI: 1.32–3.28; p = 0.000779), which remained statistically significant after multiple testing correction (padj = 0.0350). This association was replicated in a meta-analysis of 4305 cases and 4194 controls in the Shanghai Breast Cancer Genetics Study (OR 1.12, 95% CI: 1.03–1.21, p = 0.011). Further, we found evidence of an interaction between rs7874234 (TSC1) and physical activity among women of East Asian descent."
https://openalex.org/W2908109177,"Anthropogenic effects have created various risks for wild animals. Boat traffic is one of the most fatal risks for marine mammals. Individual behavioral responses of cetaceans, including diving behavior such as changing swimming direction and lengthing inter-breath interval, to passing boats is relatively well known; however, the social function of cetacean responses to boat traffic in a natural setting remains poorly understood. We focused on describing the behavioral responses of single and aggregated finless porpoises to boats passing at Misumi West Port, Ariake Sound, Japan, by using a drone characterized with a high-precision bird’s-eye angle. During the study period, we collected 25 episodes of finless porpoise responses to boats passing by. A mean (± SEM) of 5.1 ± 1.0 individuals were observed for each episode. The primary response to passing boats was avoidance by dive, which implies boat traffic is a substantial disturbance to finless porpoises that travel along the seawater surface daily. The diving duration decreased significantly with an increase in the number of aggregated individuals. The diving and floating reaction times were 10.9 ± 2.3 s and 18.7 ± 5.0 s, respectively. There was no significant difference between the reaction times indicating that each individual was motivated to keep the group cohesion consistent when floating even after the risk had dissolved, which is comparable to the behavior of porpoises that dive when riskier conditions are present, such as when a boat approaches an aggregation. Our findings provide new insights on the sociality of finless porpoises even though there were limitations, like an inability to identify a specific individual. The drone enabled us to observe the social behavior of finless porpoises and other cetaceans at an unprecedented resolution, which may lead to a better understanding of the evolutionary diversity of intelligence and sociality and the bridge to human evolution."

Canine hemangiosarcoma (cHSA) is a highly metastatic mesenchymal cancer that disseminates by hematogenous and direct implantation routes. Therapies for cHSA are generally ineffective, in part due to advanced clinical disease stage at the time of diagnosis. The validation of conventional molecular methods for detecting novel biomarkers preferentially expressed by cHSA could lead to more timely diagnosis, earlier therapeutic interventions, and improved outcomes. In humans, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a transmembrane protein overexpressed by prostate carcinoma and tumor-associated endothelium of various solid cancer histologies. Importantly, the preferential overexpression of PSMA by certain cancers has been leveraged for the development of diagnostic molecular imaging reagents and targeted therapeutics. Recently, PSMA has been qualitatively demonstrated to be expressed in cHSA cell lines, however, quantitative PSMA expressions and the potential utility of PSMA transcript identification in biologic fluids to support the presence of microscopic cHSA burden has not been reported. Therefore, this study sought to characterize the differential quantitative expressions of PSMA between cHSA and non-malignant tissues, and to determine the potential diagnostic utility of PCR-generated PSMA amplicons as a surrogate of rare cHSA cells dwelling within peritoneal and pericardial cavities.


Methods 
Quantitative gene and protein expressions for PSMA were compared between one normal endothelial and six cHSA cell lines by RT-PCR, western blot analysis, and fluorescent microscopy. Additionally, gene and protein expressions of PSMA in normal canine tissues were characterized. Graded expressions of PSMA were determined in spontaneously-arising cHSA tumor samples and the feasibility of qualitative PCR as a molecular diagnostic to detect PSMA transcripts in whole blood from healthy dogs and hemorrhagic effusions from cHSA-bearing dogs were evaluated.


Results 
PSMA gene and protein expressions were elevated (up to 6-fold) in cHSA cells compared with non-malignant endothelium. By immunohistochemistry, protein expressions of PSMA were detectable in all cHSA tissue samples evaluated. As predicted by human protein atlas data, PSMA’s expression was comparably identified at substantial levels in select normal canine tissues including kidney, liver, and intestine. In young healthy pet dogs, PSMA amplicons could not be identified in circulating whole blood yet were detectable in hemorrhagic effusions collected from pet dogs with confirmed cHSA or PSMA-expressing cancer.


Conclusions 
PSMA is quantitatively overexpressed in cHSA compared to normal endothelium, but its protein expression is not restricted to only cHSA tumor tissues, as specific visceral organs also substantively express PSMA. Optimized qualitative PCR methods failed to amplify PSMA amplicons sufficiently for visible detection in circulating whole blood derived from healthy young dogs, yet PSMA transcripts were readily identifiable in hemorrhagic effusions collected from pet dogs with histologically confirmed cHSA or PSMA-expressing cancer. While preliminary, findings derived from a limited cohort of normal and diseased pet dogs provocatively raise the potential value of PSMA amplicon detection as an ancillary molecular diagnostic test for supporting the presence of microscopic cHSA disease burden within hemorrhagic body cavity effusions."
https://openalex.org/W2907463949,"Objectives To estimate the impacts and social value relative to the cost of the Integrated Management of Alcohol Intervention Program in the Health Care System (i-MAP) on direct beneficiaries, using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) analysis. Method A mixed-method approach was conducted among stakeholders and 113 drinkers (29 low-risk, 43 high-risk, and 41 dependent drinkers) who consecutively received i-MAP at four community hospitals in Songkhla province of Thailand. Resources for program implementation as well as drinking and a list of psychosocial outcomes, selected through stakeholder interviews, were measured among participants during and at the sixth month after participation, respectively. SROI (societal benefit-to-cost) ratio of i-MAP was estimated over a 5-year time horizon and shown in 2017 Thai baht, where US$1.00 = 33.1 baht. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses of key parameters were performed among treatment subgroups. Results Baseline estimates of the annual cost and 5-year social value of i-MAP were 25.5 and 51.0 million baht, respectively, yielding an estimated SROI ratio of 2.0, with a possible range of 1.3 to 2.4. Value created by the program was mostly attributed to broader gains to society (productivity gains and averted crime costs) and drinkers. Subgroup analyses suggested that the SROI ratio for high-risk drinkers was twice that for dependent drinkers (2.8 vs. 1.5). The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that more than 99% of the simulated treatments for both high-risk and dependent groups yielded benefits beyond the corresponding costs. Conclusions By considering societal perspective, the i-MAP program has demonstrated its social value is twice its investment cost and potential for the program to be implemented nationwide."
https://openalex.org/W2907991867,"The NHS Organ Donor Register (NHS ODR) is a centralised database for U.K. residents wishing to be organ donors. Opt-in membership to the NHS ODR demonstrates an expression of a wish to donate, which can be key in decisions made by family members at time of death. By examining the demographic breakdown of the 24.9 million registrants, campaigns can be better targeted to increase membership among those groups underrepresented on the NHS ODR. Data from the NHS ODR (as of March 2017) was analysed using Chi2 Goodness of Fit analyses and Chi2 Test of Independence for the categorical variables of gender, nation of residency at time of registration, ethnicity, organ preference, registration age and age at registration. Goodness of fit analyses showed significant differences between demographic representation on the NHS ODR compared to the U.K. population. Cramer’s V showed significant associations were only of note (above 0.1) for age, ethnicity in the U.K. as a whole and ethnicity in England. Older (70+) and younger people (0–14) were underrepresented and those of White Ethnicity overrepresented on the NHS ODR. Although association strength was weak, more women and less residents of England were present compared to the U.K. population. Tests of independence showed significant differences between age at registration and current age on the register and cornea donation preferences. These results indicate areas for targeting by campaigns to increase NHS ODR membership. By understanding the strength of these associations, resources can be utilised in areas where underrepresentation is larger and will have the most impact to demographics of the NHS ODR. Additionally, by identifying which groups are over and underrepresented, future research can explore the reasons for this in these demographic groups."
https://openalex.org/W2906984979,"In ecological studies it is often assumed that predator foraging strategies and resource use are geographically and seasonally homogeneous, resulting in relatively static trophic relationships. However, certain centrally placed foragers (e.g. seals) often have terrestrial sites for breeding, resting, and moulting that are geographically distinct, and associated with different habitat types. Therefore, accurate estimations of predator diet at relevant spatial and temporal scales are key to understanding energetic requirements, predator-prey interactions and ecosystem structure. We investigate geographic variation in the diet of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus), a relatively abundant and widely distributed central place forager, to provide insights into geographic variation in resource use. Prey composition was identified using scat samples collected over concurrent timescales and a multivariate approach was used to analyse diet from two contrasting habitats. Regional differences in prey assemblages occurred within all years (2011-2013) and all seasons (ANOSIM, all p<0.05), apart from in winter. Telemetry data were used to identify core foraging areas and habitats most likely associated with scat samples collected at the two haul-out sites. Regional differences in the diet appear to reflect regional differences in the physical habitat features, with seals foraging in deeper waters over sandy substrates showing a higher prevalence of pelagic and bentho-pelagic prey species such as blue whiting and sandeels. Conversely, seals foraging in comparatively shallow waters had a greater contribution of demersal and groundfish species such as cephalopods and flatfish in their diet. We suggest that shallower waters enable seals to spend more time foraging along the benthos while remaining within aerobic dive limits, resulting in more benthic species in the diet. In contrast, the diet of seals hauled-out in areas adjacent to deeper waters indicates that either seals engage in a more pelagic foraging strategy, or that seals can spend less time at the benthos, resulting in comparatively more pelagic prey recovered in the diet. The substantial differences in prey assemblages over a small spatial scale (<300 km) demonstrates the importance of using regionally-specific diet information in ecosystem-based models to better account for different trophic interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2907331816,"Background Etiology is unknown in approximately one-quarter of stroke patients after evaluation, which is termed cryptogenic stroke (CS). The prognosis of CS patients is largely undetermined. We created a novel index from transcranial Doppler parameters including mean flow velocity (MV) and pulsatility index (PI) and investigated whether the calculation of asymmetry in the novel parameter can predict functional outcomes in CS patients. Methods We made the middle cerebral artery (MCA) index (%) as a novel parameter, which was calculated as 100 X (MCA MV + MCA PI X 10) / (MCA MV–MCA PI X 10). The MCA asymmetry index (%) was also calculated as 100 X (|Rt MCA index–Lt MCA index|) / (Rt MCA index + Lt MCA index) / 2. Poor functional outcomes were defined as modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) ≥3 at 3 months after stroke onset. Results A total of 377 CS patients were included. Among them, 52 (13.8%) patients had a poor outcome. The overall MCA asymmetry index was two-fold higher in CS patients with a poor outcome (10.26%) compared to those with a good outcome (5.41%, p = 0.002). In multivariable analysis, the overall MCA asymmetry index (OR, 1.054, 95% CI, 1.013–1.096, p = 0.009) and the cutoff value of the overall MCA asymmetry index >9 were associated with poor outcomes at 3 months (OR, 3.737, 95% CI, 1.530–9.128, p = 0.004). Conclusion We demonstrated that the novel asymmetric MCA index can predict short-term functional outcomes in CS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2907459562,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common adult leukemia in the Western world. The therapeutic approach to CLL includes chemotherapeutic regimens and immunotherapy. Complement-mediated cytotoxicity, which is one of the mechanisms activated by the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, depends on the availability and activity of the complement (C) system. The aim was to study the structure of circulating C components and evaluate the importance of C5 structural integrity for C activity in CLL patients. Blood samples were collected from 40 naïve CLL patients and 15 normal controls (NC). The Western blot analysis showed abnormal C5 pattern in some CLL patients, while patterns of C3 and C4 were similar in all subjects. Levels of the C activation markers sC5b-9 and C5a were quantified before and after activation via the classical (CP) and alternative (AP) pathways. In patients with abnormal C5, basal levels of sC5b-9 and C5a were increased while activities of the CP and of the CP C5-convertase, the immediate C5-upstream complex, were decreased compared to NC and to patients with normal C5. The data indicate a link between CP activation and apparent C5 alterations in CLL. This provides a potential prognostic tool that may personalize therapy by identifying a sub-group of CLL patients who display an abnormal C5 pattern, high basal levels of sC5b-9 and C5a, and impaired CP activity, and are likely to be less responsive to immunotherapy due to compromised CP activity."
https://openalex.org/W2907651800,"Introduction Poverty is a well-known risk factor for a child’s health and development. This paper aimed to establish whether poverty negatively affected both intra-uterine growth and early childhood growth, i.e., whether children facing poverty were at a double disadvantage. Methods For this study, we made use of routinely collected data on child development throughout early childhood from the 2006–2009 birth cohorts in Kind & Gezin’s Ikaros database collected during 2,605,975 consultations with 273,935 children from birth to 730 days old. Indicators for child development at birth were gestational age and height-at-birth. A standardized height-for-age indicator captured height development throughout early childhood. A multidimensional indicator measured the risk of poverty. For the analysis of development at birth, we used linear and logistic regression; for the analysis of height development during early childhood, we estimated linear and logistic growth curve models. Results The risk of poverty negatively affected both gestational age and height-at-birth. Throughout early childhood, we observed a negative relation between the risk of poverty and height-for-age indicators. However, the effect varied throughout childhood. Children at risk of poverty (over)compensated for their smaller stature at birth, and between ages 6 and 18 months, approximately, the negative effects of risk of poverty decreased substantially or disappeared. However, towards the end of the period studied, children born in households at risk of poverty started to lag again in height development. Conclusion This study found that the risk of poverty indeed negatively affected a child’s growth, both in utero and in early childhood. However, the results suggest that developmental lags later in childhood were not merely an extension of such lags at birth."
https://openalex.org/W2906770535,"Invasive Burmese pythons (Python bivittatus Kuhl, 1820) have introduced a lung parasite, Raillietiella orientalis, (Hett, 1915) from the python’s native range in Southeast Asia to its introduced range in Florida, where parasite spillover from pythons to two families and eight genera of native snakes has occurred. Because these novel host species present a diversity of ecological and morphological traits, and because these parasites attach to their hosts with hooks located on their cephalothorax, we predicted that R. orientalis would exhibit substantial, host-associated phenotypic plasticity in cephalothorax shape. Indeed, geometric morphometric analyses of 39 parasites from five host species revealed significant variation among host taxa in R. orientalis cephalothorax shape. We observed differences associated with host ecology, where parasites from semi-aquatic and aquatic snakes exhibited the greatest morphological similarity. Morphological analyses of R. orientalis recovered from invasive pythons, native pit vipers, and terrestrial snakes each revealed distinct shapes. Our results suggest R. orientalis can exhibit significant differences in morphology based upon host species infected, and this plasticity may facilitate infection with this non-native parasite in a wide array of novel squamate host species."
https://openalex.org/W2906955650,"β-Glucosidases enhance enzymatic biomass conversion by relieving cellobiose inhibition of endoglucanases and cellobiohydrolases. However, the susceptibility of these enzymes to inhibition and transglycosylation at high glucose or cellobiose concentrations severely limits their activity and, consequently, the overall efficiency of enzyme mixtures. We determined the impact of these two processes on the hydrolytic activity of the industrially relevant family 3 β-glucosidases from Hypocrea jecorina, HjCel3A and HjCel3B, and investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms through kinetic studies, binding free energy calculations, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. HjCel3B had a 7-fold higher specificity for cellobiose than HjCel3A but greater tendency for glucose inhibition. Energy decomposition analysis indicated that cellobiose has relatively weak electrostatic interactions with binding site residues, allowing it to be easily displaced by glucose and free to inhibit other hydrolytic enzymes. HjCel3A is, thus, preferable as an industrial β-glucosidase despite its lower activity caused by transglycosylation. This competing pathway to hydrolysis arises from binding of glucose or cellobiose at the product site after formation of the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. MD simulations revealed that binding is facilitated by hydrophobic interactions with Trp-37, Phe-260, and Tyr-443. Targeting these aromatic residues for mutation to reduce substrate affinity at the product site would therefore potentially mitigate transglycosidic activity. Engineering improved variants of HjCel3A and other structurally similar β-glucosidases would have a significant economic effect on enzymatic biomass conversion in terms of yield and production cost as the process can be consequently conducted at higher substrate loadings."
https://openalex.org/W2907502935,"Molecular oxygen (O2)-utilizing enzymes are among the most important in biology. The abundance of O2, its thermodynamic power, and the benign nature of its end products have raised interest in oxidases and oxygenases for biotechnological applications. Although most O2-dependent enzymes have an absolute requirement for an O2-activating cofactor, several classes of oxidases and oxygenases accelerate direct reactions between substrate and O2 using only the protein environment. Nogalamycin monooxygenase (NMO) from Streptomyces nogalater is a cofactor-independent enzyme that catalyzes rate-limiting electron transfer between its substrate and O2. Here, using enzyme-kinetic, cyclic voltammetry, and mutagenesis methods, we demonstrate that NMO initially activates the substrate, lowering its pKa by 1.0 unit (ΔG* = 1.4 kcal mol−1). We found that the one-electron reduction potential, measured for the deprotonated substrate both inside and outside the protein environment, increases by 85 mV inside NMO, corresponding to a ΔΔG0′ of 2.0 kcal mol−1 (0.087 eV) and that the activation barrier, ΔG‡, is lowered by 4.8 kcal mol−1 (0.21 eV). Applying the Marcus model, we observed that this suggests a sizable decrease of 28 kcal mol−1 (1.4 eV) in the reorganization energy (λ), which constitutes the major portion of the protein environment's effect in lowering the reaction barrier. A similar role for the protein has been proposed in several cofactor-dependent systems and may reflect a broader trend in O2-utilizing proteins. In summary, NMO's protein environment facilitates direct electron transfer, and NMO accelerates rate-limiting electron transfer by strongly lowering the reorganization energy."
https://openalex.org/W2907754311,"The management of complex, multi-morbid patients is challenging for solo primary care providers (PCPs) with limited access to resources. The primary objective of the intervention was to reduce the overall rate of Emergency Department (ED) visits among patients in participating practices.An interrupted time series design and qualitative interviews were used to evaluate a multifaceted intervention, SCOPE (Seamless Care Optimizing the Patient Experience), offered to solo PCPs whose patients were frequent users of the ED. The intervention featured a navigation hub (nurse, homecare coordinator) to link PCPs with hospital and community resources, a general internist on-call to provide phone advice or urgent assessments, and access to patient results on-line. Continuous quality improvement (QI) strategies were employed to optimize each component of the intervention. The primary outcome was the relative pre-post intervention change in ED visit rate for patients of participating practices compared with that for a propensity-matched control group of physicians over the contemporaneous period. Themes were identified from semi-structured interviews on PCP's experiences and influential factors in their engagement. Twenty-nine physicians agreed to participate and were provided access to the intervention over an 18-month time period. There were a total of 1,525 intervention contacts over the 18-months (average: 50.6±60.8 per PCP). Both intervention and control groups experienced a trend towards lower rates of ED use by their patients over the study time period. The pre-post difference in trend for the intervention group compared to the controls was not significant at 1.4% per year (RR = 1.014; p = 0.59). Several themes were identified from qualitative interviews including: PCPs felt better supported in the care of their patients; they experienced a greater sense of community, and; they were better able to provide shared primary-specialty care.This multifaceted intervention to support solo PCPs in the management of their complex patients did not result in a reduced rate of ED visits compared to controls, likely related to variable uptake among PCPs. It did however result in more comprehensive and coordinated care for their patients. Future directions will focus on increasing uptake by improving ease of use, increasing the range of services offered and expanding to a larger number of PCPs."
https://openalex.org/W2906988124,"Frequency analysis is a fundamental function of the auditory system, and it is essential to study the auditory response properties using behavior-related sounds. Our previous study has shown that the inferior collicular (IC) neurons of CF-FM (constant frequency-frequency modulation) bats could be classified into single-on (SO) and double-on (DO) neurons under CF-FM stimulation. Here, we employed Pratt's roundleaf bats, Hipposideros pratti, to investigate the frequency selectivity of SO and DO neurons in response to CF and behavior-related CF-FM sounds using in vivo extracellular recordings. The results demonstrated that the bandwidths (BWs) of iso-frequency tuning curves had no significant differences between the SO and the DO neurons when stimulated by CF sounds. However, the SO neurons had significant narrower BWs than DO neurons when stimulated with CF-FM sounds. In vivo intracellular recordings showed that both SO and DO neurons had significantly shorter post-spike hyperpolarization latency and excitatory duration in response to CF-FM in comparison to CF stimuli, suggesting that the FM component had an inhibitory effect on the responses to the CF component. These results suggested that SO neurons had higher frequency selectivity than DO neurons under behavior-related CF-FM stimulation, making them suitable for detecting frequency changes during echolocation."
https://openalex.org/W2906840420,"Populations of scarlet Indian paintbrush (Castilleja coccinea) in the Midwestern United States exhibit a bract color polymorphism, with each population having predominantly yellow or scarlet bracts. We investigated a possible mechanism for this maintenance of bract color polymorphism in C. coccinea by conducting hand-pollination experiments in two nearby populations, one predominantly yellow and one predominantly scarlet. The hand-pollination treatments were either self-pollination or cross pollination using pollen from within and between populations. Both color morphs were used as pollen donors for the within and between crosses. We found that both color morphs of C. coccinea were self-compatible. When the scarlet morph was the maternal plant it had higher seed set. When pollinators were excluded, the yellow morph outperformed the scarlet morph in fruit set and seed set. The apparent trade-offs between a higher reproductive output in the scarlet morph and a reproductive assurance advantage in the yellow morph may explain the maintenance of the polymorphism in C. coccinea. While many previous studies have provided evidence for pollinator preference playing a role in floral color polymorphism, the results of the current study indicate that reproductive assurance, which would be important for fluctuations in pollinator abundance or colonizing new areas, may act as a selective agent to maintain such polymorphisms."
