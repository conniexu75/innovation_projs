https://openalex.org/W1999083451,"Endothelial cell functions, such as arachidonic acid metabolism, may be modulated by membrane stresses induced by blood flow. The production of prostacyclin by primary human endothelial cell cultures subjected to pulsatile and steady flow shear stress was measured. The onset of flow led to a sudden increase in prostacyclin production, which decreased to a steady rate within several minutes. The steady-state production rate of cells subjected to pulsatile shear stress was more than twice that of cells exposed to steady shear stress and 16 times greater than that of cells in stationary culture."

https://openalex.org/W2053666983,"We show by the following series of experiments that the yeast positive regulatory protein GAL4 binds to four sites in the upstream activating sequence UASG to activate transcription of the adjacent GAL1 and GAL10 genes. GAL4 protein expressed in E. coli protected guanine residues in UASG from methylation by dimethyl sulfate. The same set of protections was seen in vivo in yeast and depended on the GAL4+ allele. This protection pattern is consistent with the idea that GAL4 protein binds to four related 17 bp sequences, each of which displays approximate 2-fold rotational symmetry. A single near-consensus synthetic 17 bp oligonucleotide, installed in front of the yeast GAL1 or CYC1 transcription units, conferred a high level of galactose inducibility upon these genes. Further experiments suggest that one mechanism of glucose repression is inhibition of the binding of GAL4 protein to DNA."

The cofactor was purified from the insect trypanosomatid Crithidia fasciculata and identified as a novel glutathione-spermidine conjugate, N1,N8-bis(L-gamma-glutamyl-L-hemicystinyl-glycyl)spermidine, for which the trivial name trypanothione is proposed. This discovery may open a new chemotherapeutic approach to trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis."
https://openalex.org/W2065762927,"The product of the lon gene in Escherichia coli, protease La, plays an important role in the degradation of abnormal proteins. To determine whether the presence of abnormal proteins stimulates expression of this gene, we examined its transcription using a lon-lacZ operon fusion. After the cells synthesized large amounts of aberrant polypeptides (e.g. following incorporation of the arginine analog, canavanine, or production of incomplete proteins with puromycin, or induction of translational errors with streptomycin), these cells showed a two- to threefold increase in lon--lacZ expression. Furthermore, synthesis of a single cloned protein, e.g. human tissue plasminogen activator, caused a similar increase in lon transcription. This induction of lon by abnormal proteins requires the heat shock regulatory gene htpR and was not seen in htpR- cells. Under these various conditions, other heat shock proteins were also induced. Thus, the appearance of aberrant cell proteins may be a common signal under many adverse conditions for the induction of cell protease (or proteases) and other heat shock proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1987967672,"Hormones such as insulin are transported from the interior to the exterior of blood vessels. Whether endothelial cells, which line the inner walls of blood vessels have a role in this transport of hormones is not clear, but it is known that endothelial cells can internalize and release insulin rapidly with little degradation. The transport of iodine-125-labeled insulin was measured directly through the use of dual chambers separated by a horizontal monolayer of cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells. In this setting, endothelial cells took up and released the labeled insulin, thereby transporting it across the cells. The transport of insulin across the endothelial cells was temperature sensitive and was inhibited by unlabeled insulin and by antibody to insulin receptor in proportion to the ability of these substances to inhibit insulin binding to its receptor. More than 80 percent of the transported insulin was intact. These data suggest that insulin is rapidly transported across endothelial cells by a receptor-mediated process."

https://openalex.org/W1999305754,"The intron of the mitochondrial 21S rRNA gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses a long internal reading frame (ORF) that is conserved in various yeast species. In crosses between intron-plus and intron-minus variants, this intron determines a specific gene conversion phenomenon, which results in the integration of the intron sequence within all previously intron-minus copies of the gene. We show, from a frameshift mutant within the intron this ORF and from the need of mitochondrial protein synthesis, that ORF encodes a protein active in the gene conversion that spreads the intron within populations of interbreeding strains. This new intron function is reminiscent of the “transposase” encoded by mobile genetic elements and is discussed in relation to other intron functions."
https://openalex.org/W1559132509,"The binding properties of the Escherichia coli encoded single strand binding protein (SSB) to a variety of synthetic homopolynucleotides, as well as to single stranded M13 DNA, have been examined as a function of the NaCl concentration (25.0 degrees C, pH 8.1). Quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the SSB protein by the nucleic acid is used to monitor binding. We find that the site size (n) for binding of SSB to all single stranded nucleic acids is quite dependent on the NaCl concentration. For SSB-poly(dT), n = 33 +/- 3 nucleotides/tetramer below 10 mM NaCl and 65 +/- 5 nucleotides/tetramer above 0.20 M NaCl (up to 5 M). Between 10 mM and 0.2 M NaCl, the apparent site size increases continuously with [NaCl]. The extent of quenching of the bound SSB fluorescence by poly(dT) also displays two-state behavior, 51 +/- 3% quenching below 10 mM NaCl and 83 +/- 3% quenching at high [NaCl] (greater than 01.-0.2 M NaCl), which correlates with the observed changes in the occluded site size. On the basis of these observations as well as the data of Krauss et al. (Krauss, G., Sindermann, H., Schomburg, U., and Maass, G. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 5346-5352) and Chrysogelos and Griffith (Chrysogelos, S., and Griffith, J. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79,5803-5807) we propose a model in which E. coli SSB binds to single stranded nucleic acids in two binding modes, a low salt mode (n = 33 +/- 3), referred to as (SSB)33, in which the nucleic acid interacts with only two protomers of the tetramer, and one at higher [NaCl], n = 65 +/- 5, (SSB)65, in which the nucleic acid interacts with all 4 protomers of the tetramer. At intermediate NaCl concentrations a mixture of these two binding modes exists which explains the variable site sizes and other apparent discrepancies previously reported for SSB binding. The transition between the two binding modes is reversible, although the kinetics are slow, and it is modulated by NaCl concentrations within the physiological range. We suggest that SSB may utilize both binding modes in its range of functions (replication, recombination, repair) and that in vivo changes in the ionic media may play a role in regulating some of these processes."
https://openalex.org/W2084699449,"Animal studies have indicated that the time of administration of adriamycin and cisplatin, two widely used anticancer drugs, has a profound effect on their toxicity. This effect in cancer chemotherapy was studied in 31 patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Patients received at least eight monthly courses of adriamycin that were followed 12 hours later by cisplatin, with adriamycin randomly administered at either 6 a.m. or 6 p.m. The results show that in the group receiving adriamycin in the evening and cisplatin in the morning (i) twice as many patients required reductions in dosage and delays in treatment, (ii) four times as many treatments had to be delayed, (iii) drug dosages had to be modified downward three times as often, and (iv) even with more dose attenuation and treatment delays, treatment complications were still about two times more common as in the group receiving adriamycin in the morning and cisplatin in the evening. These findings show that the circadian stage at which anticancer drugs are given to patients should be carefully considered."
https://openalex.org/W2040954100,"Yeast cells have been shown to internalize lucifer yellow CH by endocytosis. Internalization of the fluorescent dye is time-, temperature-, and energy-dependent, it is not saturable, and the dye is accumulated in the vacuole. Some of the yeast secretory mutants that accumulate endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi bodies are defective for endocytosis at restrictive temperature, while others are not. All of the mutants that accumulate secretory vesicles are defective for endocytosis. These results suggest that efficient transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and from the Golgi to secretory vesicles is not necessary for endocytosis. In contrast, endocytosis may be obligatorily coupled with the latest steps of secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1565334821,"Precursor forms of chloroplast proteins synthesized in cell-free translation systems can be imported posttranslationally into isolated, intact chloroplasts. Radiochemically pure precursors to the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase and to the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein have been prepared by in vitro translation of hybrid-selected mRNA and used to study this import process. If chloroplasts are pretreated with the uncoupler nigericin, import does not occur, but the precursors bind to the chloroplast surface. Reincubation of the precursor-chloroplast complex in the presence of ATP results in import of bound precursors. The binding appears to be mediated by proteins of the outer chloroplast envelope membrane because pretreatment of chloroplasts with protease inhibits their ability to bind as well as to import precursors. These results indicate that at least a portion of the observed binding is to functional receptor proteins involved in the import process."
https://openalex.org/W2041985793,"Cyclosporin A, a potent immunosuppressive agent, has been widely used to treat patients with solid organ transplants. Although its precise mechanism of action is unknown, it appears to inhibit subsets of T lymphocytes at an early stage in cell activation. Fluorescent, fully active derivatives of cyclosporin A and calmodulin, a protein that binds calcium and is therefore essential to normal cell function, were utilized to demonstrate that cyclosporin A binds to calmodulin. Flow cytometry showed that the calmodulin inhibitors R24571 and W-7 competitively inhibited binding of cyclosporin A to cloned T lymphocytes. Cyclosporin A inhibited the calmodulin-dependent activation of phosphodiesterase in a dose-dependent manner. Binding of cyclosporin A to calmodulin may prevent the latter's role in the activation of the second messengers and enzymes required for effective cell proliferation and function in the immune response."
https://openalex.org/W1992304591,"Activated versions of ras genes have been found in various types of malignant tumors. The normal versions of these genes are found in organisms as diverse as mammals and yeasts. Yeast cells that lack their functional ras genes, RASSC-1 and RASSC-2, are ordinarily nonviable. They have now been shown to remain viable if they carry a mammalian rasH gene. In addition, yeast-mammalian hybrid genes and a deletion mutant yeast RASSC-1 gene were shown to induce morphologic transformation of mouse NIH 3T3 cells when the genes had a point mutation analogous to one that increases the transforming activity of mammalian ras genes. The results establish the functional relevance of the yeast system to the genetics and biochemistry of cellular transformation induced by mammalian ras genes."
https://openalex.org/W2072864973,"The optional 1143 by intron in the yeast mitochondrial 21S rRNA gene (ω+) is nearly quantitatively inserted in genetic crosses into 21S rRNA alleles that lack it (ω−). The intron contains an open reading frame that can encode a protein of 235 amino acids, but no function has been ascribed to this sequence. We previously found an in vivo double-strand break in ω− DNA at or close to the intron insertion site only in zygotes of ω+ × ω− crosses that appears with the same kinetics as intron insertion. We now show that mutations in the intron open reading frame that would alter the translation product simultaneously inhibit nonreciprocal ω recombination and the in vivo double-strand break in ω− DNA. These results provide evidence that the open reading frame encodes a protein required for intron transposition and support the role of the double-strand break in the process."
https://openalex.org/W2070563634,"We describe the isolation of two chromosomal DNA fragments from Plasmodium falciparum. These fragments encode the antigenically distinct S antigens of two different P. falciparum isolates, namely FC27 from Papua New Guinea and NF7 from Ghana. The complete nucleotide sequences of both fragments are presented. The fragments are homologous over most of their lengths, including the entire regions flanking the protein coding sequences. Whereas the N- and C-terminal portions of sequences encoding the S antigens are homologous, major portions of the coding sequences are not. The nonhomologous regions are comprised of tandemly repeated sequences, of 33 by in FC27 and predominantly of 24 by in NF7. The 33 by tandem repeats encoded by the FC27 S-antigen gene could not be detected in the NF7 genome. Conversely, the 24 by tandem repeats encoded by the NF7 S-antigen gene could not be detected in the FC27 genome. The pattern of sequence variation within the repeats of both genes suggests a mechanism for the generation of S-antigen diversity."
https://openalex.org/W1563354863,"Insulin binding to its receptor stimulates a tyrosine-specific protein kinase. This enzyme phosphorylates the insulin receptor, as well as a variety of exogenous substrates in vitro. In the present studies, we have identified an endogenous substrate for the insulin receptor-associated kinase. We studied insulin-stimulated protein phosphorylation in partially purified insulin receptor preparations from the livers of dexamethasone-treated rats. In this cell-free system, insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of its own receptor as well as of a phosphoprotein of apparent Mr = 120,000 (termed pp120). pp120 was not immunoprecipitated by three anti-receptor antisera, nor was the receptor immunoprecipitated by antisera raised against pp120, suggesting that pp120 is not antigenically related or tightly bound to the insulin receptor. Dose-response curves for receptor and pp120 phosphorylation stimulated by pork insulin were essentially identical, and showed the appropriate specificity (insulin much greater than proinsulin) for a receptor-mediated event. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that insulin stimulated the incorporation of 32P predominantly into tyrosine residues of pp120. Casein, an artificial substrate for the insulin receptor kinase, competed with pp120 for insulin-stimulated phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of pp120 was rapid (half-maximal effect within 2 min at 24 degrees C) and, like receptor phosphorylation, was supported with Mn2+ or Mg2+ as divalent cation and ATP as the phosphate donor. While receptor autophosphorylation and artificial substrate phosphorylation were not altered by prior treatment of the rats with dexamethasone, insulin-stimulated pp120 phosphorylation was enhanced in preparations derived from dexamethasone-treated rats, suggesting an alteration of pp120, not the receptor, as a result of dexamethasone-treatment. Further studies of this newly identified endogenous substrate may help clarify the physiologic role of the insulin receptor-associated kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1485122127,"An elastinolytic proteinase secreted by tissue-invasive larvae of Schistosoma mansoni has been purified to homogeneity.

The native enzyme has a molecular weight of 30,000, a pI of 8, a pH optimum of 9, and a calcium dependence of 2 mM. A second Mr 17,000 form of the enzyme was present in crude secretions and appears to be an autoproteolysis product.

https://openalex.org/W1564164899,"We describe the characterization in vitro of three hybrid trp-lacUV5 (TAC) promoters, which have perfect homology to the -10 and -35 Escherichia coli promoter consensus hexamer sequences, but which differ in the distance between the -10 and -35 regions. The three promoters, TAC16, TAC17, and TAC18 have spacings of 16, 17, and 18 base pairs, respectively. We have measured KB and k2, the constants that describe the formation of open complexes, on these three promoters. We have also measured their relative strengths on supercoiled plasmid DNA. Our results show that these are the strongest promoters that have been characterized in vitro so far and confirm the hypothesis that the consensus promoter sequence is best. We find the TAC17 promoter (KBk2 = 8.4 X 10(7) M-1 s-1) to be stronger than either the TAC16 (KBk2 approximately 1.5 X 10(7) M-1 s-1) or TAC18 (KBk2 approximately 3.5 X 10(7) M-1 s-1) promoters, a result that is in agreement with other findings on the effect of spacer length. The choice of start point for transcription is affected by spacer length. Transcription from all the promoters was stimulated at moderate concentrations of salt (less than 150 mM) and persisted at high salt concentrations (300 mM)."

https://openalex.org/W1557535868,"The kinetics of receptor internalization and recycling was directly determined in adipocytes by measuring 125I-insulin binding to total, intracellular, and cell-surface insulin receptors. In the absence of insulin 90% of all receptors were on the cell-surface and 10% were intracellular. Insulin (100 ng/ml) rapidly altered this distribution by translocating surface receptors to the cell-interior through a temperature and energy dependent process. Surface-derived receptors were seen within cells as early as 30 s and accumulated intracellularly at the rate of approximately 20,000/min (t 1/2 = 2.7 min). After 6 min the size of the intracellular receptor pool plateaued (for up to 2 h), with 30% of surface receptors residing within the cell. This plateau was due to the attainment of an equilibrium between receptor uptake and recycling, since removal of insulin (to stop receptor uptake) was followed by both a rapid depletion of intracellular receptors and a a concomitant and stoichiometric reappearance of receptors on the cell-surface. Receptors were efficiently recycled, with little or no net loss observed even after 4 h of insulin treatment; however, recycling could be partially inhibited (approximately 10%) by several agents (e.g. chloroquine and Tris). Tris treatment of adipocytes in the presence of insulin led to 50% loss of surface and total receptors at 2 and 4 h, respectively. Since chloroquine prevented the decrease in total receptors, but not the loss of surface receptors, it appears that Tris impairs recycling by diverting a portion of incoming receptors to a chloroquine-inhibitable degradative site. From these results we conclude that: 1) insulin triggers endocytotic uptake of insulin-receptor complexes; 2) internalized receptors are then rapidly reinserted into the plasma membrane, and the receptors can traverse this recycling pathway within 6 min; 3) prolonged recycling does not normally result in measurable receptor loss, but when receptors are prevented from recycling, they become trapped intracellularly and are shunted to a chloroquine-sensitive degradative pathway; and 4) chloroquine and Tris are only partially effective inhibitors of receptor recycling."
https://openalex.org/W2043127059,"The cellular distribution of enkephalin, an endogenous opioid, in the developing rat cerebellum was determined by immunocytochemistry. Methionine and leucine enkephalin were concentrated in the external germinal layer, a matrix of proliferative cells; staining was confined to the cortical cytoplasm. Enkephalin was not detected by immunocytochemistry in differentiated neural cells. These results indicate that endogenous opioids are involved specifically in early phases of nervous system development, particularly cell proliferation and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1558178310,"The intracellular pathway and the activation of lipoprotein lipase have been examined in differentiated Ob17 cells. These adipose cells were previously shown to secrete lipoprotein lipase during exposure to heparin. Treatment of the cells with cycloheximide and heparin leads to enzyme depletion, as shown by activity measurement and immunofluorescence microscopy. The repletion phase has been studied in the presence of monensin or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, ionophores known to affect the intracellular transport of membrane and secretory proteins. Monensin-treated cells synthesize fully active lipoprotein lipase. Under these conditions the antigen accumulates in the Golgi apparatus and the heparin-stimulated enzyme release is extensively reduced. Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone-treated cells do not contain any enzyme activity but show detectable antigen which accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum. Competition for binding to immobilized anti-lipoprotein lipase antibodies of mature and endoplasmic reticulum-sequestered antigens is observed. Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone removal is rapidly followed by a transient burst of enzyme activity and a redistribution of the antigen in the different subcellular compartments. Therefore, the results show that the activation of lipoprotein lipase is an intracellular event taking place after the enzyme exits from the endoplasmic reticulum and before it reaches the trans-Golgi cisternae."
https://openalex.org/W2118533974,"A 1.1 kb intron containing an open reading frame (ORF) in one allele (ω+) of the yeast mitochondrial 21S rRNA gene is nearly quantitatively inserted in crosses into a 21S rRNA allele lacking that Intron (ω−). We have determined that this nonreciprocal exchange initiates soon after cells fuse to form zygotes and is complete by 10–16 hr after mating. We have discovered a unique in vivo double-strand cut in ω− mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) at or near the site of intron insertion that is implicated in the process. Markers flanking the intron insertion site are coconverted with frequencies inversely proportional to their distance from that site. There is no net conversion of ω− to ω+ in crosses between petites retaining these alleles, nor do we observe the unique double-strand cut in the mtDNA from zygotes of such crosses. The data suggest that a translation product of the intron ORF is required for the double-strand cut and nonreciprocal recombination at ω."

https://openalex.org/W1604177959,"Abstract Secondary and tertiary structures of four yeast tRNA precursors that contain introns have been elucidated using limited digestion with a variety of single-strand- and double-strand-specific nucleases. The pre-tRNAs, representing the variety of intron sizes and potential structures, were: pre-tRNALeuCAA, pre-tRNALeuUAG, pre-tRNAIleUAU, and pre-tRNAPro-4UGG. Conventional tRNA cloverleaf structure is maintained in these precursors except that the anticodon loop is interrupted by the intron. The intron contains a sequence which is complementary to a portion of the anticodon loop and allows the formation of a double helix often extending the anticodon stem. The 5' and 3' splicing cleavage sites are located at either end of this helix and are single-stranded. The intron is the most sensitive region to nuclease cleavage, suggesting that it is on the surface of the molecule and available for interaction with the splicing endonuclease. Absence of Mg2+ or spermidine renders the dihydrouridine and T psi C loops of these precursors highly sensitive to nuclease digestion. These ionic effects mimic those observed for tRNAPhe and suggest that the tRNA portion of these precursors has native tRNA structure. We propose consensus secondary and tertiary structures which may be of significance to eventual understanding of the mechanism of yeast tRNA splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2035965789,"Plasmodium falciparum, the most lethal of the malarial parasites that infect humans, undergoes three cycles of development in its vertebrate host and elicits stage-specific immune responses. This stage specificity of the immune response has made it difficult to isolate antigens that would be useful in developing a vaccine against malaria. A complementary DNA clone for a glycophorin-binding protein of Plasmodium falciparum merozoites has been isolated and characterized. The protein interacts with glycophorin, the erythrocyte receptor, during invasion of the host cell by the parasite. Antigenic determinants of this protein expressed in Escherichia coli have been used to produce antibodies to a glycophorin-binding protein. The antibodies show schizont-specific immunofluorescence and react with the merozoite protein. The primary sequence of these determinants reveals a 150-nucleotide tandem-repeating sequence coding for a 50-amino-acid repeat. The characterization of the Plasmodium falciparum glycophorin-binding protein represents one approach toward designing serologic agents to block the parasite's development in the vertebrate host."

(1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 9459-9468). In the present study we describe a mitochondrial mutation capable of suppressing the respiratory deficiency of cbp2 mutants. The mitochondrial suppressor mutation has been shown to be the result of a precise excision of the last intervening sequence from the cytochrome b gene. Strains with the altered mitochondrial DNA have normal levels of mature cytochrome b mRNA and of cytochrome b and exhibit wild type growth on glycerol. These results confirm that CBP2 codes for a protein specifically required for splicing of the cytochrome b intron and further suggest that absence of the intervening sequence does not noticeably affect the expression of respiratory function in mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1666520625,"Cytoplasmic elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) was purified to homogeneity from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a large-scale procedure. The three steps of purification used were batch adsorption on phosphocellulose, phosphocellulose chromatography and, as the last step, GDP-Sepharose or Biorex column chromatography. The protein is very basic (pI = 9.2) and has an apparent molecular mass of 49 kDa, as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using denaturing conditions. It is one of the most abundant proteins in yeast (about 5% of total soluble protein), as shown by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and by immunological titration. A strong immunological and structural homology was found between yeast EF-1 alpha and elongation factors from other sources. Common immunological features were found between yeast and wheat germ EF-1 alpha. Tryptic hydrolysis of yeast EF-1 alpha in the presence of 25% glycerol generated a large trypsin-resistant polypeptide (Mr = 43,000) which had the same NH2-terminal sequence as the proteolyzed product from rabbit reticulocyte, Artemia salina EF-1 alpha and Escherichia coli EF-Tu. Completed DNA sequence determination of one structural gene for yeast EF-1 alpha confirmed a remarkable conservation of several protein sequence domains in yeast and animal EF-1 alpha (Cottrelle, P., Thiele, D., Price, V., Memet, S., Micouin, J.Y., Marck, C., Buhler, J.M.

This indication of a primary parasite interaction site on band 3 supports a role for this protein in mediating the radical alterations of the erythrocyte cytoskeleton that accompany invasion."
https://openalex.org/W1502821675,"Phospholamban, a putative regulator of the Ca2+-dependent ATPase of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), was purified from canine cardiac SR membranes. Cardiac SR was extracted with deoxycholate and fractionated with ammonium sulfate followed by gel permeation high performance liquid chromatography in the presence of the nonionic detergent, octa-ethylene glycol mono-n-dodecyl ether (C12E8), and KI. Further purification was achieved with CM-Sepharose CL 6B column chromatography in the presence of C12E8. The purified phospholamban showed a single band of 22,000 daltons on neutral sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Weber, K., and Osborn, M. (1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 4406-4412) and 27,000 daltons on alkaline SDS gels (Laemmli, U. K. (1970) Nature (Lond.) 227, 680-685). Boiling of phospholamban in 2% SDS produced total conversion into the lower molecular weight component on SDS gels (11,000 on Laemmli gel and 10,500 on Weber and Osborn gel). The apparent molecular weight of phospholamban on SDS gels was slightly increased by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation. The extent of phosphorylation catalyzed by cAMP-dependent protein kinase in the purified phospholamban preparations was about 42 nmol of phosphate/mg of protein when the protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (Lowry, O. H., Rosebrough, N. J., Farr, A. L., and Randall, R. J. (1951) J. Biol. Chem. 193, 265-275), or 138 nmol/mg of protein based on the protein concentration estimated by the dye absorption method. Rabbit antisera were prepared against purified phospholamban. The obtained antisera were found to bind to purified phospholamban as well as that in cardiac SR. No reaction was detected in fast skeletal muscle SR by immunofluorescent staining of Western blots. The present preparation of purified phospholamban and the antisera should facilitate further understanding of the regulatory action of phospholamban on the calcium pump ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1505326511,"A rapid one-step method was developed for harvesting and concentrating insulin receptors from solubilized adipocytes, which entails precipitating soluble receptors with polyethylene glycol and resuspending the receptor-containing pellet in a reduced volume of binding buffer. With this procedure 90-100% of receptors were recovered, while 80% of cellular protein was removed, thus resulting in a marked reduction of both ligand and receptor proteases and about a 5-fold purification of the receptor. More importantly, greater than 98% of the Triton X-100 detergent was removed during this procedure so that the reduced receptor affinity observed in solubilized extracts (due to detergent) was restored to normal. Reconstituted receptors exhibited normal binding characteristics similar to those observed for plasma membrane receptors. The general utility of our receptor precipitation-reconstitution method is highlighted by studies on insulin-induced translocation of receptors from the cell-surface to the cell-interior of adipocytes and studies on the assessment of the binding affinity of nascent intracellular receptors. The results of these studies are consistent with the following. 1) Insulin initiates endocytotic uptake of insulin receptors, which then recycle back to the cell-surface. 2) Chloroquine impairs the recycling of internalized receptors while preventing receptor degradation, resulting in the progressive trapping and accumulation of receptors within cells during insulin treatment. 3) Receptor translocation during acute insulin-induced down-regulation is stoichiometric in that receptors lost from the cell-surface can be quantitatively recovered within the cell-interior. 4) In the absence of ligand, these receptors within adipocytes are mainly newly synthesized receptors enroute to the cell-surface, and they possess an affinity similar, if not identical, to mature receptors on the plasma membrane."

To further characterize membrane tyrosine phosphorylation in the two major classes of lymphocytes, the tryptic phosphopeptides of their endogenous substrates were compared and the sensitivity of the kinases to inhibition by N alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) was determined. The two major B cell substrates (61,000 and 55,000 daltons, p61 and p55) were gel purified after phosphorylation and exhaustively digested with trypsin. Separation by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography demonstrated that these two substrates had two identical phosphotyrosine containing tryptic phosphopeptides. p61 had an additional phosphotyrosine site. Parallel analysis of the two T cell substrates (64,000 and 58,000 daltons, p64 and p58) showed that they also contained two phosphotyrosine sites that were identical. However, the tryptic phosphopeptides from the B and T cell substrate pairs were clearly distinct suggesting that they arise from different gene products. When B and T cell membrane fractions were preincubated with TLCK (21 degrees C, 30 min) a dose-dependent decrease in p64 and p58 phosphorylation resulted. p61 and p55 phosphorylation was not affected at concentrations up to 10 mM TLCK. Tyrosine-specific kinase activity was also assessed by measuring phosphorylation of a tyrosine containing synthetic peptide. The kinase activity of T cell plasma membrane fractions was inhibited by TLCK; the B cell activity was unaffected. The results suggest that membrane fractions from normal and some neoplastic B and T cells have at least two different tyrosine-specific kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1648048768,"The tryptophan synthase alpha 2 beta 2 complex from Salmonella typhimurium can be crystallized by the method of vapor diffusion from solutions of polyethylene glycol 8000 and various salts. Thin needles are obtained in the presence of a monovalent cation (Na+), thicker crystals are obtained in the presence of divalent cations (Mg2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Ca2+, Zn2+), and square-faced crystals are obtained in the presence of spermine. Although the spermine and Mg2+ crystals differ in morphology, they are both monoclinic and in space group C2 with a = 184.5 A, b = 62.4 A, c = 67.7 A, beta = 94 degrees 40', and one alpha beta pair of Mr = 71,700/asymmetric unit. The crystals appear reasonably resistant to radiation damage and should be suitable for a complete structure investigation. The separated S. typhimurium alpha, holo-beta 2, and apo-beta 2 subunits do not crystallize under these conditions nor do the alpha 2 beta 2 complex or the alpha- or holo-beta 2 subunits from Escherichia coli or from an interspecies hybrid."
https://openalex.org/W1524847951,"In the presence of 10-100 microM monensin (a monovalent cation ionophore), a considerable amount of 125I activity of iodoinsulin accumulated in isolated rat epididymal adipocytes during a 30-min incubation. The accumulation was secondary to the action of monensin to inhibit dissociation of a certain fraction of the cellbound 125I activity. This monensin effect was reversible. The accumulation of 125I activity was ATP dependent and so was the discharge of the accumulated radioactivity. Approximately 91% of the accumulated radio-activity was precipitable with trichloroacetic acid, and at least 84% was reactive to anti-insulin antibody. Monensin at 100 microM appeared to have only mild effects on the cellular activities of glucose transport and cAMP phosphodiesterase. Nevertheless, when cells were first exposed to 10 nM insulin in the presence of 100 microM monensin and then transferred into a hormone-free buffer that contained monensin, the phosphodiesterase activity in cells remained partially activated as if cells were kept exposed to approximately 0.5 nM insulin. Under similar conditions, glucose transport activity remained partially activated as if cells were incubated with approximately 70 pM insulin. Monensin did not inhibit the reversal of the insulin effect per se. Like monensin, 20-100 microM chloroquine (a lysosomotropic inhibitor) induced a considerable accumulation of [125I] iodoinsulin. However, cells that had been exposed to insulin in the presence of chloroquine retained little hormonal effect after washing. Based on these observations and on the reported biological effects of monensin, it is suggested (a) that monensin may induce intracellular accumulation of the insulin-receptor complex by blocking the acidification of endocytic vesicles and (b) that the accumulated insulin-receptor complex may retain a weak, but significant, capacity to stimulate both glucose transport and phosphodiesterase activities."

https://openalex.org/W1529999986,"Abstract DNA polymerase I* is a form of the DNA polymerase I isolated from Escherichia coli which are expressing recA/lexA (SOS) functions. Induction of recA or polA1 cells by nalidixic acid does not result in the appearance of pol I*, but lexA or recA mutants that are constitutive for SOS functions constitutively express pol I* and mutants which lack functional recA protein produce pol I* when they carry a lexA mutation which renders the lexA repressor inoperative. Pol I* has been induced by nalidixic acid in dinA, dinD, dinF, and umuC mutants. Polymerase I* has a lower affinity for single-stranded DNA-agarose than polymerase I and it sediments through sucrose gradients in a dispersed manner between 6.6-10.5 S, whereas polymerase I sediments at 5 S. Whereas pol I* migrates significantly faster than pol I in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, the active polypeptide of both forms migrates at the same rate in denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Compared with polymerase I, polymerase I* has an enhanced capacity to incorporate the adenine analog, 2-amino-purine, into activated salmon sperm DNA and a relatively low fidelity in replicating synthetic polydeoxyribonucleotides. Both the 3'----5' (proofreading) and 5'----3' (nick-translational) exonuclease activities of pol I* and pol I are indistinguishable. Estimates of processivity give a value of approximately 6 for both forms of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1603822260,"We have employed both small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) and large unilamellar vesicles formed by the reverse phase evaporation technique (REV) to study the initial kinetics of membrane aggregation and fusion. Stopped flow measurements of the calcium-induced changes in the turbidity of SUV and REV, formed from 1:1 (mol/mol) mixtures of bovine phosphatidylserine (PS) and Escherichia coli phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), were used to follow particle aggregation. Simultaneous measurements of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer from N-(7-nitro2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl) (NBD)-PE to rhodamine (Rho)-PE incorporated into the vesicle bilayers established that 1) both initial aggregation and fusion can be described as a bimolecular process and 2) the rate-limiting step of membrane fusion is aggregation. Thus fusion takes place in the microsecond time domain. Parallel experiments, which simultaneously measured aggregation and the dequenching of encapsulated carboxyfluorescein (CF) in the presence and absence of antifluorescein antibodies in the suspension medium, established that the small unilamellar vesicles rapidly lose their contents of CF as they fuse. On the other hand, the first few cycles of fusion of the large unilamellar vesicles are nonleaky, but leakage develops within 1-2 s as the particles grow in size. Thus the results demonstrate that the SUV are poor models for the study of nonleaky fusion, while the REV must be carefully tested before unambiguous interpretation of fusion assays involving the formation of tight complexes (such as the terbium-dipicolinic assay) can be made. NBD-PE undergoes very rapid, Ca2+-promoted changes in quantum yield which can obscure the resonance energy transfer signals. Thus data from the NBD-PE/Rho-PE energy transfer pair must be carefully scrutinized for artifacts."
https://openalex.org/W2023720924,"Human lymphocytes were exposed in vitro to ultrasound from two clinical devices, one of which was previously reported to have increased the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges. The ultrasonic exposures had no significant effect on the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges from three blood donors. Exposure to ultrasound also had no effect on cell cycle progression. A concomitant positive control (mitomycin C) resulted in a significant increase in sister chromatid exchanges."
https://openalex.org/W1561751151,"In Escherichia coli, adenylate cyclase activity in toluene-treated cells can be inhibited by glucose while the activity in a broken cell preparation cannot. Adenylate cyclase activity in the permeabilized but not in broken cells is stimulated somewhat specifically and additively by potassium and phosphate. Kinetic studies show sigmoid substrate-velocity curves for the toluene-treated cells but hyperbolic curves for the broken cells. The stimulatory effects of potassium and phosphate on adenylate cyclase activity in tolulene-treated cells are associated with increases in the Vmax and Km for ATP. While the enzyme activity in toluene-treated cells shows a preference for magnesium over manganese, the reverse is observed in broken cells. Stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity in toluene-treated cells requires the presence of the proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). The PTS proteins can be phosphorylated in a P-enolpyruvate-dependent reaction. The stimulatory effects of ions will not occur if the PTS proteins are not phosphorylated. Since potassium phosphate stimulates both adenylate cyclase and PTS activities in toluene-treated cells, it is proposed that the effect of potassium phosphate on adenylate cyclase activity is mediated through an effect on the PTS. A model for dual regulation by glucose of adenylate cyclase activity is proposed. This model involves regulation of both the condition of the PTS proteins as well as the cellular concentration of phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1555761919,"Abstract Creatine kinase has been identified as a most prominent component of Torpedo electric organ and a minority constituent of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) membranes obtained therefrom. Purification by low temperature ethanol extraction, precipitation of the Mg2+-enzyme complex, and mercurial-agarose chromatography yield preparations of soluble kinase with specific activities greater than 550 units/mg protein. Retention times in ion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography, electrophoretic behavior, immunochemical properties, tryptic mapping, and amino acid composition enable the comparison of creatine kinase isoenzymes. The denatured subunits of the predominant species have pI values of 6.3-6.8 and Mr = 40,000-42,000 characteristic of the so-called v2 proteins and show cross-reactivity with antibodies against the BB (brain type) creatine kinase. The MM (muscle type) antigens could be detected in the total electrocyte, but not in the AChR membranes; they have a slightly lower molecular weight and higher pI. The in situ membrane association of the BB isoenzyme is confirmed by immunocytochemistry. The apparent Km values for the substrate creatine phosphate are 2.2 mM for the AChR membrane-associated enzyme and 2.5 mM for the muscle form. The apparent Km values for Mg2+-ADP are 0.54 and 0.22 mM, respectively. Thus, a 2-fold higher affinity in the binding of ADP to the binary enzyme-creatine-P complex results from membrane association."
https://openalex.org/W1588119759,"Raman spectra were taken of human alpha (leukocyte) interferon subtype A (HuIFN-alpha A) purified from extracts of transformed Escherichia coli. Quantitative analysis of the conformationally sensitive amide I band indicates that IFN (interferon)-alpha A is 75 +/- 5% helical and 7 +/- 4% beta-strand. An independent analysis of the amide III spectrum indicates 71 +/- 5% helix and 10 +/- 6% beta-strand. These results differ with a recently proposed three-dimensional model based on secondary structure predictions derived from sequence and with circular dichroism measurements. The Raman spectrum of IFN-alpha A is compared with the spectra of several other helical proteins: hemerythrin, intestinal calcium-binding protein, melittin, and insulin."

https://openalex.org/W1496114479,"Messenger RNA injected Xenopus oocytes exhibit a differential capacity for translation. mRNAs translated in the free cytoplasm are translated efficiently whereas mRNAs translated on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) membrane are translated inefficiently. If mRNA injected oocytes are injected additionally with proteins isolated from the RER, enhanced translation of RER-bound mRNAs is observed. When examined by sucrose gradient centrifugation and RNA dot blots, most of the injected RER-bound mRNA sediments less than or equal to the 80 S monosome. The RER proteins recruit these preinitiated mRNAs onto polysomes as evidenced by a shift in sedimentation to the polysome region of a sucrose gradient. When examined by immunoblotting, the RER proteins are shown to contain a protein which reacts specifically with an antibody directed against docking protein (SRP-receptor protein). However, this putative docking protein does not appear to be the protein which actually recruits the preinitiated mRNAs onto polysomes."
