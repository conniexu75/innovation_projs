https://openalex.org/W1981397830,"DAMAGE to skin collagen and elastin (extracellular matrix) is the hallmark of long-term exposure to solar ultraviolet irradiation1–3, and is believed to be responsible for the wrinkled appearance of sun-exposed skin4,5. We report here that matrix-degrading metalloproteinase messenger RNAs, proteins and activities are induced in human skin in vivo within hours of exposure to ultraviolet-B irradiation (UVB). Induction of metalloproteinase proteins and activities occurred at UVB doses well below those that cause skin reddening. Within minutes, low-dose UVB upregulated the transcription factors AP-1 and NF-KB, which are known to be stimulators of metalloproteinase genes6,7. All-transretinoic acid, which transrepresses AP-1 (ref. 8), applied before irradiation with UVB, substantially reduced AP-1 and metalloproteinase induction. We propose that elevated metalloprotein-ases, resulting from activation of AP-1 and NF-KB by low-dose solar irradiation, degrade collagen and elastin in skin. Such damage, if imperfectly repaired, would result in solar scars, which through accumulation from a lifetime of repeated low-dose sunlight exposure could cause premature skin ageing (photoageing)."

https://openalex.org/W1973238622,"The ability of differing subunit combinations of γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors produced from murine α1, β2, and γ2L subunits to form functional cell surface receptors was analyzed in both A293 cells and Xenopus oocytes using a combination of molecular, electrophysiological, biochemical, and morphological approaches. The results revealed that GABAA receptor assembly occurred within the endoplasmic reticulum and involved the interaction with the chaperone molecules immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein and calnexin. Despite all three subunits possessing the ability to oligomerize with each other, only α1β2 and α1β2γ2L subunit combinations could produce functional surface expression in a process that was not dependent on N-linked glycosylation. Single subunits and the α1γ2L and β2γ2L combinations were retained within the endoplasmic reticulum. These results suggest that receptor assembly occurs by defined pathways, which may serve to limit the diversity of GABAA receptors that exist on the surface of neurons."

https://openalex.org/W1547490339,"Caveolin, a 22-24-kDa integral membrane protein, is a principal component of caveolar membranes in vivo. Caveolin has been proposed to function as a scaffolding protein to organize and concentrate signaling molecules within caveolae. Because of its unusual membrane topology, both the N- and C-terminal domains of caveolin remain entirely cytoplasmic and are not subject to luminal modifications that are accessible to other integral membrane proteins. Under certain conditions, caveolin also exists in a soluble form as a cytosolic protein in vivo. These properties make caveolin an attractive candidate for recombinant expression in Escherichia coli. Here, we successfully expressed recombinant full-length caveolin in E. coli. A polyhistidine tag was placed at its extreme C terminus for purification by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. Specific antibody probes demonstrated that recombinant caveolin contained a complete N and C terminus. Recombinant caveolin remained soluble in solutions containing the detergent octyl glucoside and formed high molecular mass oligomers like endogenous caveolin. By electron microscopy, recombinant caveolin homo-oligomers appeared as individual spherical particles that were indistinguishable from endogenous caveolin homo-oligomers visualized by the same technique. As recombinant caveolin behaved as expected for endogenous caveolin, this provides an indication that recombinant caveolin can be used to dissect the structural and functional interaction of caveolin with other protein and lipid molecules in vitro. Recombinant caveolin was efficiently incorporated into lipid membranes as assessed by floatation in sucrose density gradients. This allowed us to use defined lipid components to assess the possible requirements for insertion of caveolin into membranes. Using a purified synthetic form of phosphatidylcholine (1,2-dioleoylphosphorylcholine), we observed that incorporation of caveolin into membranes was cholesterol-dependent; the addition of cholesterol dramatically increased the incorporation of caveolin into these phosphatidylcholine-based membranes by ~25-30-fold. This fits well with in vivo studies demonstrating that cholesterol plays an essential role in maintaining the structure and function of caveolae. Further functional analysis of these reconstituted caveolin-containing membranes showed that they were capable of recruiting a soluble recombinant form of Gi2α. This is in accordance with previous studies demonstrating that caveolin specifically interacts directly with multiple G protein α-subunits. Thus, recombinant caveolin incorporated into defined lipid membranes provides an experimental system in which the structure, function, and biogenesis of caveolin-rich membrane domains can be dissected in vitro.

Caveolae are specialized domains of the plasma membrane that are found in most cell types(1.Anderson R.G.W. Kamen B.A. Rothberg K.G. Lacey S.W.

However, they are most abundant in adipocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and muscle cells(3.Severs N.J. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90: 341-348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In adipocytes, caveolae represent up to 20% of the total plasma membrane surface area(4.Fan J.Y. Carpentier J.-L. van Obberghen E. Grunfeld C. Gorden P. Orci L. J. Cell Sci. 1983; 61: 219-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Functionally, caveolae have been implicated in endothelial transcytosis(5.Simionescu N. Simionescu M. Palade G.E. J.

The “caveolae signaling hypothesis” states that caveolar localization of certain lipid-modified signaling molecules could provide a means for integrating certain transmembrane signaling events (13.Lisanti M.P. Scherer P. Tang Z.-L. Sargiacomo M. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 231-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 14.Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Koleske A.J.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 655-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Caveolin, a 22-24-kDa protein, is an integral membrane component of caveolar membranes(16.Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that caveolin may function as a scaffolding protein for organizing and concentrating caveolin-interacting molecules within caveolae(17.Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In this regard, caveolin appears to be very important for the formation of caveolar membranes. Caveolin expression levels correlate very well with the biochemical and morphological appearance of caveolae. For example, (i) caveolin is most abundant in cell types that contain numerous caveolae, i.e. adipocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts(18.Glenney J.R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar); (ii) caveolin and caveolae are both induced ~10-25-fold during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to the adipocyte form(4.Fan J.Y. Carpentier J.-L. van Obberghen E. Grunfeld C. Gorden P. Orci L. J. Cell Sci. 1983; 61: 219-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Baldini G. Sargiacomo M. Corley-Mastick C. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar); (iii) caveolin levels are dramatically reduced, and caveolae are morphologically absent in cells transformed by various activated oncogenes (v-abl, activated ras, and others)(20.Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar); and (iv) recombinant expression of caveolin in caveolin-negative cell lines results in the correct targeting of caveolin to caveolae-enriched membrane fractions and allows the de novo formation of caveolae(21.Scherer P.E.

Parton R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). These results suggest that caveolin represents an important structural protein for directing the formation of caveolar membranes. Several structural properties of caveolin are also consistent with a role for caveolin in organizing caveolar domains. Both the N- and C-terminal domains of caveolin face the cytoplasm and are thus accessible for interactions with cytoplasmically oriented molecules (23.Dupree P. Parton R.G. Raposo G. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1597-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar); caveolin copurifies with cytoplasmic signaling molecules including heterotrimeric G proteins, Src family tyrosine kinases, and Ras-related GTPases(6.Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z.L. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 8.Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z.L. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Tu Y.-H.

Okamoto T. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E. Hansen S.H. Nishimoto I. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15693-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar); and caveolin exists within caveolar membranes as a high molecular mass homo-oligomer(17.Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 25.Monier S. Parton R.G. Vogel F. Behlke J. Henske A. Kurzchalia T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 911-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Thus, caveolin could serve as an oligomeric docking site for organizing and concentrating inactive signaling molecules within caveolar membranes(17.Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). To study the molecular interaction of caveolin with other molecules, we have recently expressed full-length caveolin and portions of caveolin as GST 1The abbreviations used are: GSTglutathione S-transferasemAbmonoclonal antibodyNTAnitrilotriacetic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMes4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidMBSMes-buffered saline. fusion proteins in Escherichia coli(17.Sargiacomo M.

However, preparations of GST-full-length caveolin also contained substantial amounts of GST cleaved to its active core as the complete fusion was somewhat unstable. The partial success of this approach prompted us to express full-length caveolin in E. coli without the GST moiety. Full-length caveolin without GST would more closely approximate the natural state of the caveolin molecule in vivo. Here, we report the purification and characterization of soluble recombinant full-length caveolin without GST and its interaction with lipid membranes of defined molecular composition. Despite that caveolin is an integral membrane protein, it was expressed well using this approach. This may be related to the observations that under certain conditions, caveolin also exists in a soluble form as a cytosolic protein in vivo(26.Smart E. Ying Y.-S. Conrad P. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), and both caveolin N- and C-terminal domains remain entirely cytoplasmic and are not subject to luminal modifications(21.Scherer P.E.

Glenney (Transduction Laboratories). The cDNA for canine caveolin was obtained as we described previously(6.Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z.L. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody 9E10 was provided by the Harvard Monoclonal Antibody Facility (Cambridge, MA). Ni2+-NTA-agarose for purification of polyhistidine-tagged proteins was from QIAGEN Inc. The purified lipid extract from brain tissue was from Sigma (type VI, catalog No. B1877). Cholesterol and synthetic phosphatidylcholine (1,2-dioleoylphosphorylcholine) were from Matreya, Inc. and Avanti Polar Lipids, respectively. The GST-Gi2α construction, encoding the cDNA for bovine Gi2α, was the kind gift of Dr. Ikuo Nishimoto (Massachusetts General Hospital). Anti-Gi2α antibodies were from Dupont NEN. To purify caveolin after expression in E. coli, we incorporated the polyhistidine tag into the C terminus of the Myc-tagged canine caveolin cDNA using PCR primers (caveolin-Myc-His7). The C-terminally Myc-tagged form of caveolin used as the template was as we described previously(21.Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16395-16401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The final construction was subcloned into the MCS (HindIII-BamHI) of the vector pET-17b (Novagen, Inc.) for expression in E. coli (strain BL21(DE3); Novagen, Inc.). E. coli (strain BL21(DE3)) was transformed with the recombinant plasmid harboring the caveolin cDNA. A 1:100 dilution of an overnight starter culture was used to inoculate 600 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin (175 μg/ml), and the culture was incubated with shaking at 37°C. After the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6, freshly dissolved isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM and cultured for an additional 3 h. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation in an SS34 rotor (6000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C) and washed once with STE buffer (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA), and the bacterial pellet was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. After freezing, bacteria were resuspended in 15 ml of STE buffer and treated with lysozyme (100 μg/ml for 15 min on ice). The sample was then adjusted to 1.5% N-lauroylsarcosine (Sigma) and homogenized with a Polytron tissue grinder (Brinkmann Instruments; two 30-s bursts). The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation in an SS34 rotor (16,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C). After clarification, the supernatant was adjusted to 2% Triton X-100 and allowed to bind to Ni2+-NTA-agarose for 4 h rotating at 4°C. Note that 100 μl of Ni2+-NTA-agarose was used per 100 ml of bacterial culture. After binding, Ni2+-NTA-agarose was washed six times with STE buffer and eluted in STE buffer containing 200 mM imidazole and 60 mM octyl glucoside for 2 h at 4°C. The soluble eluate was designated as recombinant caveolin. For long-term storage, the eluate was adjusted to 50% glycerol and stored at −20°C. A yield of ~5 mg of purified recombinant caveolin was obtained from a 600-ml bacterial culture. It is important to note that purified recombinant caveolin also remains soluble even after dialysis to remove octyl glucoside. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose. After transfer, nitrocellulose sheets were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-caveolin IgG (mAb 2234; 1:400) or anti-Myc IgG (mAb 9E10; 1:1000) or to streptavidin blotting to visualize biotin-labeled proteins. For immunoblotting, incubation conditions were as described by the manufacturers (Promega and Amersham Corp.), except that we supplemented our blocking solution with both 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% non-fat dry milk (Carnation). Biotinylated proteins were detected by blotting with iodinated streptavidin and autoradiography with an intensifying screen as described(28.Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. Graeve L. LeBivic A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 107: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Estimation of the molecular mass of recombinant caveolin was performed as we described previously for endogenous native caveolin(17.Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were loaded atop a 5-40% linear sucrose gradient (4.3 ml) and centrifuged at 50,000 rpm (~340,000 × g) for 10 h in an SW 60 rotor (Beckman Instruments). Note that the entire gradient was prepared with MBS (25 mM Mes, pH 6.5, 0.15 M NaCl) plus 60 mM octyl glucoside. After centrifugation, gradient fractions were collected from above. Molecular mass standards for velocity gradient centrifugation were as follows: carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), and apoferritin (443 kDa) (Sigma). Samples were sandwiched between two pieces of freshly cleaved mica. Mica sheets were separated and placed on the stage of a Denton 502A vacuum evaporator and dried for 20 min. Samples were shadowed with a platinum-palladium wire at an angle of 4° while rotating at 60 rpm and then coated with carbon at an angle of 90°. Replicas were removed by floating onto water and placed on uncoated 400-mesh copper grids. Micrographs of random fields were made with a 1200 CX JEOL electron microscope. The incorporation of recombinant caveolin into membranes was monitored by floatation in sucrose density gradients. Briefly, recombinant caveolin was mixed with purified lipid components in 2 ml of MBS containing 60 mM octyl glucoside and dialyzed overnight against MBS lacking detergent to allow the association of caveolin with lipids. More specifically, ~85 μg of recombinant caveolin was added either to 1.8 mg of the purified lipid extract dissolved in octyl glucoside or to 2.5 mg of synthetic phosphatidylcholine dissolved in octyl glucoside; experiments involving cholesterol were performed in a similar manner, except that phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio before the addition of caveolin. The dialysate was then adjusted to 40% sucrose by the addition of 2 ml of 80% sucrose prepared in MBS and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A 5-30% discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed above (4 ml of 5% sucrose, 4 ml of 30% sucrose; both in MBS lacking detergent) and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 16-20 h in an SW 41 rotor (Beckman Instruments). A light-scattering band confined to the 5-30% sucrose interface contained the associated lipids and formed regardless of whether or not caveolin was added. Fractions (1 ml each) were collected from the top and subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis with anti-caveolin mAb 2234. Alternatively, the light-scattering band at the 5-30% sucrose interface was collected by centrifugation and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Recombinant GST-Gi2α was purified as we previously described for other GST fusion proteins(24.Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E. Hansen S.H. Nishimoto I. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15693-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Purified soluble GST-Gi2α (~50-100 μg) was incubated with one-tenth of a single preparation of either reconstituted caveolin-rich membranes or caveolin-deficient membranes. After 2-4 h at 4°C rotating end-over-end, soluble unbound GST-Gi2α was removed by re-floatation in sucrose density gradients. Reconstituted membranes used as the substrate for binding were prepared with the purified lipid extract and recombinant caveolin as detailed above. Bound GST-Gi2α was visualized by immunoblotting with anti-Gi2α antibodies. A strategy was devised for recombinant expression and purification of soluble caveolin in E. coli. The cDNA for the entire coding sequence of canine caveolin was inserted into the multiple cloning site of a bacterial expression vector under control of the T7 promoter. A Myc epitope tag was placed at its C terminus with a polyhistidine tag following the Myc tag (Fig. 1A). The polyhistidine tag allows purification by affinity chromatography using Ni2+-NTA-agarose. A yield of ~5 mg of purified recombinant caveolin was typically obtained from a 600-ml bacterial culture. Purified recombinant caveolin remained soluble in solutions containing the detergent octyl glucoside; it did not behave as an insoluble aggregate. Recombinant caveolin appeared relatively pure. As caveolin fails to stain with standard protein stains(21.Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16395-16401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), purified preparations of recombinant caveolin were biotinylated in solution. This technique is more sensitive than silver staining; in vitro biotinylation allows the detection of picogram quantities of protein(29.Lisanti, M. P., Sargiacomo, M.

Caveolin appeared as a single band without any major contaminants or degradation products (Fig. 1B). However, it should be noted that the molecular mass of recombinant caveolin was slightly larger than that of endogenous caveolin. This reflects the addition of the Myc epitope and polyhistidine tags. To monitor the completeness of the N- and C-terminal ends of caveolin, two specific antibody probes were utilized: mAb 2234, which recognizes caveolin residues 1-21, and mAb 9E10, which detects the Myc epitope placed at the C-terminal end of caveolin. The single major band observed by in vitro biotinylation was immunoreactive with both these probes (Fig. 1B), indicating that recombinant caveolin contains a complete N and C terminus and therefore represents the full-length caveolin protein. Endogenous caveolin exists as a ~350-kDa homo-oligomer (containing ~14-16 monomers/oligomer) as shown using several different approaches(17.Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S.

The oligomeric state of purified recombinant caveolin was next assessed by employing an established velocity gradient system developed previously to study homo-oligomers of endogenous caveolin(17.Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Several integral membrane proteins have been previously shown to migrate at their expected monomeric molecular mass in these same velocity gradients(17.Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E.

Fig. 2 shows that purified recombinant caveolin migrated as expected as a high molecular mass complex between 200- and 443-kDa molecular mass standards. This provides an indication that recombinant caveolin is correctly folded as it remains soluble in detergent solutions and forms high molecular mass oligomers of the same relative size as endogenous caveolin. Endogenous caveolin homo-oligomers appear as individual globular particles (~4-6 nm in diameter) by electron microscopy using a low-angle platinum shadowing technique(17.Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The same approach was used to examine the ultrastructure of recombinant caveolin. Fig. 3 shows that recombinant caveolin appeared as individual globular particles of the same diameter previously reported for endogenous caveolin homo-oligomers. Thus, recombinant caveolin behaves as expected for endogenous caveolin in its solubility properties, oligomeric state, and morphologic appearance. It is important to note that when the same construction used here was recombinantly expressed in mammalian cells, it cofractionated with endogenous caveolin (Fig. 4), an indication that the Myc epitope tag and the His tag do not interfere with the caveolar targeting of this engineered form of caveolin. Previous reports have also indicated that tagging of caveolin at either its N or C terminus with the Myc epitope does not affect its caveolar localization in vivo(21.Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Chun M.

As caveolin is an integral membrane protein, the ability of recombinant caveolin to be incorporated into lipid membranes was evaluated. Recombinant caveolin was added to an octyl glucoside-solubilized extract of purified lipids derived from brain. Incorporation of recombinant caveolin was monitored by floatation in sucrose density gradients. In this assay, octyl glucoside-dissociated lipids reassociated and migrated to the 5-30% sucrose interface of these gradients. Assembly of lipids was independent of the addition of caveolin. Under these conditions, caveolin was quantitatively incorporated into these membranes (Fig. 5). As expected, floatation of caveolin was strictly dependent upon the"

https://openalex.org/W1507509867,"Epithelium-specific gene expression is fundamental in both embryogenesis and the maintenance of adult tissues, and impairment of epithelial characteristics contributes to diseases such as cancer. We have here analyzed the 5′-region of the epithelial (E-) cadherin gene in order to understand mechanisms of epithelium-specific transcription and loss of expression during epithelial-mesenchymal transitions. The regulatory region of the mouse epithelial cadherin gene is composed of a promoter (from position −94 to the transcription start site) and a 150-base pair enhancer located in the first intron. The 5′-promoter consists of positive regulatory elements (a CCAAT-box and two AP-2 binding sites in a GC-rich region) and the palindromic element E-Pal that activates and represses transcription in epithelial and mesenchymal cells, respectively. The enhancer of the first intron stimulates the activity of heterologous promoters exclusively in epithelial cells. This epithelium-specific enhancer consists of three elements (E I to E III; E II and E III bind AP-2) that are necessary and sufficient for activity.

We thus propose two regulatory mechanisms by which epithelial specificity of epithelial cadherin expression is determined: suppression of promoter activity in mesenchymal cells by E-Pal and enhancement of activity in epithelial cells by both E-Pal and the epithelium-specific enhancer. Epithelia are essential and abundant tissues in most eukaryotic organs. Epithelial cells are the first identifiable embryonic cell type, which appears during compaction of the morula early in development (Fleming et al., 1993). During gastrulation, epithelial-mesenchymal transitions take place, and in this process epithelium-specific genes are repressed, and genes of the mesenchymal (and neuronal) lineages are activated (Cunningham and Edelman, 1990; Jessell and Melton, 1992). New epithelia usually derive from existing ones, i.e. from the ectoderm or endoderm, but can also be formed from the mesoderm by mesenchymal-epithelial transitions (e.g. during development of the kidney) (Saxen, 1987). In development, epithelial-mesenchymal and mesenchymal-epithelial transitions take place in a temporally and spatially controlled manner (Valles et al., 1991; Boyer and Thiery, 1993; Birchmeier and Birchmeier, 1993), whereas in tumors these changes are highly uncontrolled; loss of epithelial character is typically observed late in progression of carcinomas and correlates there with the acquisition of invasive and metastatic potential (Birchmeier and Behrens, 1994; Reichmann, 1994). Epithelial cells form continuous cell layers, and they are generally polar. In single-layered epithelia (e.g. the mature intestine), apical and basolateral cell surface are separated by tight junctions (Citi, 1993). An example of a multilayered epithelium is the skin, where basal cells (stem cells) are covered by layers of gradually differentiating cells (Fusenig et al., 1994). Thus, epithelia are extremely complex tissues, and they are highly variable in type and degree of differentiation. Typical structures in epithelia are adherens junctions and desmosomes (Buxton and Magee, 1992; Tsukita et al., 1993; Hülsken et al., 1994a), which are organelles responsible for strong intercellular adhesion; epithelial cells also form hemidesmosomes to the basement membranes at their basal side (Timpl, 1989; Sonnenberg et al., 1991). Polar epithelial cells developed special mechanisms that allow the transport of membrane proteins to either the apical or basolateral surface (Eaton and Simons, 1995). Epithelial cells express characteristic genes that are responsible for the maintenance of the epithelial phenotype; for example, components of junctions or keratins (Birchmeier and Behrens, 1994; Kouklis et al., 1994; Buxton et al., 1993), specific epithelial products (e.g. albumin in the liver) (Cereghini et al., 1987), and specific transcription factors (e.g. LFB-3 in the liver or kidney) (De Simone et al., 1991). Recently, much progress has been made in the elucidation of the molecular basis of epithelial junction formation (Tsukita et al., 1993; Garrod, 1993; Citi, 1993; Hülsken et al., 1994b). Adherens junctions are specialized structures containing the transmembrane cell adhesion molecule epithelial cadherin E-cadherin, 1The abbreviations used are: E-cadherinepithelial cadherinbpbase pair(s)CATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseHLHhelix-loop-helixPCRpolymerase chain reaction. that recognizes and binds E-cadherin present on the neighboring cells in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The cDNA of E-cadherin codes for a signal peptide and a presequence at the amino terminus, a large extracellular domain with four repeated domains important in Ca2+-binding, a single transmembrane sequence, and a short cytoplasmic domain (Takeichi, 1991; Kemler, 1993). E-cadherin is the prototype of a family of Ca2+-dependent cell adhesion molecules and is expressed in all embryonal and adult epithelial tissues. In development, E-cadherin expression is down-regulated during epithelial-mesenchymal transitions and reappears during reversion to the epithelial phenotype. For example, E-cadherin disappears during differentiation of the dorsal ectoderm into the neural tube (Thiery et al., 1982; Nose and Takeichi, 1986), and it is induced in epithelial cells that develop from mesenchyme during morphogenesis of kidney tubules (Vestweber et al., 1985). Overall, E-cadherin is thus a faithful component in all epithelia and plays a functional role that is essential for the maintenance of the epithelial phenotype (Imhof et al., 1983; Behrens et al., 1989). Accordingly, homozygous mutations of E-cadherin introduced into mice by homologous recombination disturbed early embryogenesis: The individual cells of the morulae lose their morphologic polarization and do not form a blastocoel. The mutant embryos cannot leave the zona pellucida and, therefore, do not implant into the uterus (Larue et al., 1994; Riethmacher et al., 1995). epithelial cadherin base pair(s) chloramphenicol acetyltransferase helix-loop-helix polymerase chain reaction. Since down-regulation of E-cadherin expression is a frequent event late in progression of human carcinomas and since modulation of E-cadherin expression plays a major role during development, we and others have begun to analyze the E-cadherin promoter and have found epithelial specificity in a fragment 178 bp upstream of the transcription start site (Behrens et al., 1991; Ringwald et al., 1991; Bussemakers et al., 1994). This promoter fragment contains a GC-rich region, a CCAAT-box, and a 12-bp palindromic element, which we named E-Pal. We have furthermore found that epithelium-specific transcription correlates with factor binding to these elements in vivo and to a loosening of chromatin structure in the promoter region (Hennig et al., 1995). Other epithelium-specific promoters have recently also been examined: The upstream regulatory regions of the epithelium-specific human papilloma viruses (HPV) 16 and 18 contain several binding sequences for ubiquitous cellular transcription factors (cf. Cripe et al., 1990; Hoppe-Seyler and Butz, 1994; Bernard and Apt, 1994). Epithelial specificity thus appears to be achieved by different combinations of these cellular factors. Specific factors have also been characterized that contribute to epithelial specificity; for instance, a mesenchyme-specific member of the NF-1 family represses transcription in fibroblasts but not in epithelial cells (Apt et al., 1993). Other epithelium-specific activators and repressors such as KRF-1, a coactivator of transcriptional enhancer factor-1 and YY1 have recently been described (Mack and Laimins, 1991; Ishiji et al., 1992, Bauknecht et al., 1992). Here we report that epithelium-specific expression of the E-cadherin gene is achieved by two different mechanisms; E-Pal in the upstream promoter activates or suppresses transcription in epithelial or mesenchymal cells, respectively. A new epithelium-specific enhancer (ESE) was discovered in the first intron of the gene, that enhances transcription in a tissue-specific manner and binds nuclear factors specifically in epithelial cells. The E-cadherin promoter-CAT constructs are derivatives of the deletion −178/+92 cloned in the pCAT basic vector (Behrens et al., 1991). To generate the −94 or −78 deletion constructs, a HindIII/PstI fragment (−178 to −79) was replaced by a double-stranded oligonucleotide, or the blunt-ended vector was directly religated, respectively. To obtain mutants of E-Pal, the CCAAT-box, or the GC-rich region, restriction fragments of the −178/+92 construct were replaced by corresponding mutant oligonucleotides. The restriction sites PstI(−99), NarI(−54), EclXI(−22), or KspI (+18), were used for the exchange. The CCAAT sequence was mutated to TCCG, and the AP-2 binding sites in subregions GCI and GCII were mutated to GCCGTTTTC and TTCTGCGGG, respectively. For analysis of the intronic enhancer, a 1.9-kilobase genomic BamHI fragment containing intron 1 and parts of intron 2 was ligated into the TK-CAT construct (pBLCAT2) (Luckow and Schütz, 1987). Deletions of the enhancer were made with Exonuclease III (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and PCR fragments were ligated into TK-CAT. The AP-2 expression construct SPRSV AP-2 was kindly provided by Dr. T. Williams (New Haven, CT). In the construct AP-2ΔTA (Williams and Tjian, 1991), nucleotides 153-413 were removed. All sequences were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cell lines are described in Frixen et al.(1991) and Behrens et al.(1991). For transfection experiments, cells were seeded at a density of 106 per 10-cm tissue culture dish and transfected with usually 5 μg of the various promoter constructs using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (Gorman et al., 1982). The amounts of cell extracts for the CAT assays were adjusted according to β-galactosidase activity from cotransfected plasmids Rous sarcoma virus lacZ (Behrens et al., 1991) or pCH110 (Pharmacia). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (Behrens et al., 1991). For DNase I footprint assays, an XbaI/KspI fragment of the E-cadherin promoter (positions −178 to +17) or the intronic enhancer (positions 672-311 from the BamHI site in intron 1) were labeled with Klenow enzyme. For the AP-2 footprint assays, 30 ng of purified recombinant transcription factor AP-2 (Promega) were employed. In the competition footprint assays of the enhancer region, 50 ng of the double-stranded oligonucleotides were added to the reaction: E II, 5′-GATCCCCCTGTGTGCCCTGAGGGGGGTCCTCCCCACTAG-3′; E III, 5′-GATCCACTAATCCCGGCGCCCGAGGCGAGGGAAGGGTTACCCTTG-3′; AP-2, 5′-GATCCAAAGTCCCCAGGCTCCCCAG-3′, SP-1, 5′-GATCCTGGGCGGAGTTAGGGGCGGGACTG-3′. We and others have previously analyzed the E-cadherin promoter and found epithelial specificity in a −178 bp fragment upstream of the transcription start site (Behrens et al., 1991, Ringwald et al., 1991, Bussemakers et al., 1994). This fragment contains a GC-rich region with subregions GCI and GCII, a CCAAT-box, and a 12-bp palindromic element that we named E-Pal (Fig. 1A). We demonstrate here that deletion or mutation of E-Pal resulted in a 5-fold increase of promoter activity in mesenchymal cells, e.g. fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells (Fig. 1B). Similarly, mutation of E-Pal leads to an increase (2-4-fold) of promoter activity in E-cadherin-negative carcinoma cells (Table 1). A slight decrease of promoter activity was observed when E-Pal was mutated or deleted in E-cadherin-expressing carcinoma cell lines. In the mouse mammary epithelial cell line Ep-FosER, which looses E-cadherin expression following activation by estrogen, the E-Pal mutation also leads to an increase of promoter activity (Table 1). These data demonstrate that E-Pal is a negative regulatory element in mesenchymal (E-cadherin-negative) cells but has a weak positive activity in epithelial cells.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab We attempted to identify regulatory factors that control the E-cadherin promoter through the E-Pal element, by comparing the functional effects of specific mutations of E-Pal with the capacity of nuclear factor binding in gel retardation assays. Mutations in the center or in the 3′-half of E-Pal (mut 1 to mut 4) increased promoter activity in fibroblasts (Fig. 2A), in contrast to a mutation of the 5′-side (mut 5). A specific nuclear factor from fibroblasts was found to bind to the E-Pal element in gel retardation assays (Fig. 2B), which could be competed only by the wild-type oligonucleotide and the one mutated in the 5′-half of E-Pal. This suggests that binding of a specific factor (repressor) of fibroblasts to E-Pal correlates with suppression of promoter activity. However, we are aware of the fact that a similar band shift is seen when nuclear extracts from epithelial cells are examined (not shown, but see Behrens et al.(1991)). We next examined the contribution of the CCAAT-box and the GC-rich region to transcriptional activity of the E-cadherin promoter. Mutation of either the core sequence of the CCAAT-box or one of the two consensus binding sites for the transcription factor AP-2 (cf. Williams and Tjian, 1991) strongly reduced promoter activity in epithelial cells (Fig. 3A). These mutations also reduced the activity of the promoter with a mutated E-Pal in fibroblasts (Fig. 3B). Mutation of all three elements completely abolished promoter activity. These data show that both the CCAAT-box and the GC-rich region represent positive regulatory elements in both epithelial and mesenchymal cells.Figure 3:CCAAT-box and GC-rich region are positively acting elements of the E-cadherin promoter. Left, schemes of the wild type and mutant constructs of the −178 bp E-cadherin promoter. Point mutations of the elements are marked by crosses (for sequences see “Materials and Methods”).

Activities are expressed relative to the wild type promoter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The GC-rich region of the E-cadherin promoter binds the transcription factor AP-2, as revealed by footprint analysis (Fig. 4). Mutation of each of the two AP-2 binding sites in the subregion GCI or GCII narrowed the footprint with both recombinant AP-2 and nuclear extracts on the respective sides. Footprint formation at both sites was inhibited by an oligonucleotide containing the AP-2 binding site of the SV40 enhancer (data not shown; cf. Imagawa et al. (1987)). Furthermore, a cotransfected dominant-negative mutant of AP-2 that lacks the transactivation domain inhibited activity of both the −178 and −58 bp promoters in a concentration-dependent fashion (Table 2). These data indicate that AP-2 or a closely related factor regulate the E-cadherin promoter by binding in a tandem arrangement to the GC-rich region.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In a recent in vivo analysis, we identified DNase I-hypersensitive sites in the first and second introns of the E-cadherin gene that are specific for E-cadherin-expressing cells (Hennig et al., 1995). The respective genomic regions were here examined for enhancer activity on the TK minimal promoter (Fig. 5). The used 1.9-kilobase BamHI fragment of the first and part of the second intron enhanced promoter activity 4.5-fold in epithelial cells; deletion of intron 2 sequences to position 672 led to a further (12.5-fold) enhancement of activity, which may indicate the presence of a negative regulatory region between positions 1100 and 672. Further deletion abolished activity, thus localizing the enhancer to a region of 200 bp of intron 1 (compare the activity of constructs 672 and 475 in Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained when the deletion fragments were examined with the SV40 minimal promoter. Enhancer activity was also observed when the 1.9-kilobase fragment was tested in the reverse orientation (in the TK and SV40 promoter) or at a distance of 2.7 kilobases from the transcription start site of the SV40 promoter (data not shown). Footprint analysis of the enhancer in intron 1 revealed binding of nuclear factors to three subregions, E I to E III (Fig. 6). The sequences E II and E III are specifically protected by nuclear extracts from E-cadherin-expressing carcinoma cell lines (MCF-7 and RT 112) but not from E-cadherin-negative carcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231 and T 24); region E I was protected by extracts from both cell types. DNA sequencing of the protected areas revealed that E I to E III are GC-rich; E II and E III contain sequences that match the AP-2 consensus site (Fig. 7; cf. also Williams and Tjian(1991)).Figure 7:Genomic sequence of the E-cadherin enhancer region. The sequence encompasses the KpnI site of intron 1 (position 311, cf. Fig. 5), the regions E I to E III (boxes), and part of exon 2 (boldface letters). Numbering is from the BamHI site of intron 1. Arrows indicate primers used for PCR cloning of enhancer fragments. The putative AP-2 and H4TF-1 binding sites are marked by dots and a dashed line, respectively. The sequence of the ESE has been submitted to the EMBL data bank, accession number X90561.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The contribution of the individual elements E I to E III to the function of the intronic enhancer was examined by using various PCR-generated subfragments (Fig. 8): a 149-bp fragment comprising all three elements exhibited strong enhancer activity in both orientations on the TK promoter in MCF-7 epithelial cells. Two copies of the enhancer showed 40-fold enhancement of activity (not shown). Interestingly, removal of any of the individual elements abolished enhancer activity, indicating that the integrity of the whole E I to E III cluster is sufficient and necessary to confer enhancer activity. The fragment of 149 bp also confers enhancer activity to the TK promoter in several other E-cadherin-expressing cell lines (Table 3). No enhancer activity was found in fibroblasts and dedifferentiated carcinoma cells. We therefore named the 149-bp region ESE, i.e. epithelium-specific enhancer. Detailed footprint analysis of the ESE element with various nuclear extracts revealed general protection of the elements E I to E III in E-cadherin-expressing carcinoma cells; the element E I is protected in E-cadherin-negative carcinoma cells, and the elements E II and E III are protected in fibroblasts (Table 3). Region E I contains a consensus binding sequence for the transcription factor H4TF-1 (cf. Dailey et al.(1988); we have not examined this factor any further). Binding of nuclear factors of MCF-7 cells to both regions E II and E III was competed by an AP-2 but not by an SP-1 binding site oligonucleotide (Fig. 9; Kadonaga et al.(1987)). Oligonucleotides containing the sequences of either E II or E III interfered with factor binding to both regions. Moreover, regions E II and E III were also protected by recombinant AP-2 (Fig. 9).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 9:Analysis of AP-2 binding to the E-cadherin enhancer by in vitro footprinting. Footprinting analysis was performed using nuclear extracts from epithelial MCF-7 cells or recombinant AP-2 protein.

Protected regions E I to E III are marked on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We report here that epithelium-specific regulation of the E-cadherin gene is controlled by two different mechanisms. First, the E-Pal element in the promoter 5′ of the transcription start site acts as a positive or negative element in epithelial or mesenchymal cells, respectively. Second, a tissue-specific enhancer (ESE) in the first intron promotes transcription exclusively in epithelial cells. We also demonstrate that both these mechanisms are disturbed in carcinoma cells that have progressed to a less differentiated state and are E-cadherin-negative. We suspect that the E-cadherin gene is activated and repressed by similar mechanisms during mesenchymal-epithelial transitions in development. We describe here three cis-acting elements in the E-cadherin promoter that exhibit positive regulatory activity in epithelial cells: E-Pal, the CCAAT-box, and a GC-rich region. We have previously shown that the E-Pal element also confers positive regulatory activity to a SV40 promoter in epithelial cells (Behrens et al., 1991). In nonepithelial cells, CCAAT-box and GC-rich region exhibit positive transcriptional potential, but this activity is masked by E-Pal, i.e. becomes apparent only when E-Pal is mutated or deleted. We also provide here evidence that a specific factor binds to E-Pal in fibroblasts and that binding specificity of this factor correlates with biological activity. Transcriptional repressors that act via binding to a specific promoter element have been described by others (see Renkawitz(1990) and Johnson(1995) for reviews). For instance, the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene wt1 suppresses transcription by binding to a GC-rich promoter sequence, and a protein domain of WT1 could be identified that retained inhibitory activity when combined with a heterologous DNA-binding domain (Madden et al., 1991; Drummond et al., 1992). Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of WT1 depends on p53; in its absence, WT1 acts as a transcriptional activator (Maheswaran et al., 1993). Thus, the dual function of WT1 is reminiscent of the opposite activities of E-Pal and its putative binding factor in epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Both half-sites of E-Pal are similar to the consensus sequence for binding of helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factors; it is therefore suggested that HLH factors play a role in the regulation of the E-cadherin promoter by the E-Pal element. Mutation analysis showed that the right HLH binding motif in E-Pal is necessary for function, whereas integrity of the left HLH site is less essential. Interestingly, only the right half of E-Pal is conserved in the human E-cadherin promoter (Bussemakers et al., 1994). We have also found that the HLH proteins Myc and Max bind to E-Pal in vitro; however, no modulation of the activity of the E-cadherin promoter could be demonstrated (data not shown). HLH proteins have frequently been implicated in tissue-specific gene expression (Weintraub et al., 1991; Lee et al., 1995). It is therefore conceivable that yet unknown HLH transcription factors play a role in epithelium-specific regulation of the E-cadherin promoter. Interestingly, expression of the muscle-specific HLH transcription factor myoD in keratinocytes induces morphological dedifferentiation of the cells and loss of epithelial markers (Boukamp et al., 1992). We also demonstrate here that the CCAAT-box and the GC-rich region are positively acting elements in the E-cadherin promoter and have little cell type specificity of their own. CCAAT-box binding proteins that serve tissue-specific functions have been described previously (Umek et al., 1991; Katz et al., 1993). We found three complexes of factors that bind to the CCAAT-box in gel retardation assays, and these did not appear when the CCAAT sequence was mutated. Competition by specific oligonucleotides revealed that various members of the CCAAT-box family of proteins such as CP-1 and C/EBP (Chodosh et al., 1988; Landschulz et al., 1988) are candidates for activation of the E-cadherin promoter (data not shown). We have not analyzed the CCAAT-box of the E-cadherin promoter any further. Binding and functional data suggest that the transcription factor AP-2 or closely related factors regulate the activity of the GC-rich region of the E-cadherin promoter. (i) In DNase I footprint assays, two subregions GCI and GCII were identified that bound purified AP-2 with similar characteristics as factors present in nuclear extracts. Binding to both sites GCI and GCII could be competed with a single AP-2 specific oligonucleotide. (ii) In transient transfection experiments, AP-2 that lacks the transactivation domain suppressed the activity of the E-cadherin promoter in a concentration-dependent manner. Cis-elements representing AP-2 binding sites have recently been implicated in the regulation of promoters of various epidermal cytokeratins (Leask et al., 1991, Snape et al., 1991, Byrne and Fuchs, 1993). However, it is unlikely that AP-2 has an exclusive role in epithelium-specific gene expression since it is found in ectodermal derivatives but not in several other epithelial tissues that express E-cadherin (Mitchell et al., 1991). The ESE of the E-cadherin gene was discovered by the analysis of DNase I-hypersensitive sites followed by analysis of deletion constructs and PCR fragments for enhancer activity. The enhancer region corresponds to hypersensitive site 4 in the first intron of the E-cadherin gene, as described previously (Hennig et al., 1995). Transcriptional enhancers are generally associated with loosened chromatin structure, as in the case of the SV40 and polyoma virus enhancer; these enhancers are characterized as nucleosome-free regions and are hypersensitive toward DNase I (Serfling et al., 1985). The minimal region of the ESE of the E-cadherin gene (150 bp) activates transcription from heterologous promoters by a factor of 15 in MCF-7 cells (40-fold when used in a tandem arrangement) that is independent of orientation and distance. Detailed analysis of the ESE revealed three elements, E I to E III, which are all GC-rich. These elements are necessary and sufficient for enhancer activity in several E-cadherin-expressing epithelial cell lines. In contrast, the ESE is inactive in all E-cadherin-negative cell lines such as fibroblasts and dedifferentiated carcinoma cells. The ESE therefore has a modular structure, which is characteristic for several other enhancers, e.g. the CD2 or SV40 enhancers (Serfling et al., 1985; Lake et al., 1990). In the epithelium-specific enhancer of papilloma viruses, numerous elements contribute to enhancer activity, but the involved sequences are generally bound by ubiquitous transcription factors (see Hoppe-Seyler and Butz(1994) for a review). We found that the ESE of the E-cadherin gene is active in cells that express all three factors that bind to E I to E III, but is inactive when one factor is lacking. We also demonstrated that AP-2 or related factors bind to E II and E III; again epithelium-specificity cannot be explained by the action of AP-2 only. It is possible that recently identified splice variants of AP-2 (Meier et al., 1995) play a role in the specific regulation of ESE. The expression of the E-cadherin gene is thus under the control of an epithelium-specific promoter plus an epithelium-specific enhancer. We suggest that the combination of these two regulatory mechanisms provides additional specificity and strength of expression of the E-cadherin gene. This is thus different to the regulation of the related L-CAM gene (a chicken homologue of E-cadherin). There, a low activity and nonspecific promoter gains tissue specificity when combined with an enhancer in the second intron (Sorkin et al., 1993). In the P-cadherin gene, an enhancer is also located in the second intron (Hatta et al., 1994). 2M. Faraldo and A. Cano, personal communication. In addition promoter and enhancer of the E-cadherin gene act differently in mesenchymal cells. Here the enhancer is inactive, but the promoter contributes to repression through the E-Pal element. To our knowledge, a combination of an epithelium-specific enhancer with an epithelium-specific promoter that acts as a repressor in mesenchymal cells has not previously been found.

INTRODUCTIONHighly conserved cDNAs encoding calreticulin, an abundant protein that has been localized to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumBiPimmunoglobulin heavy chain- binding proteinHIVhuman immunodeficiency virusHIV-1HIV type 1VSVvesicular stomatitis virusPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. have been isolated from human, mouse, rabbit, rat, Xenopus, Aplysia, Drosophila, Onchocerca, Caenorhabditis, and Schistosoma libraries (for a review see (1.Nash P. Opas M. Michalak M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 135: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar)). There is over 90% amino acid sequence identity between rabbit, mouse, human, and rat calreticulins(2.Michalak M. Milner R.E. Burns K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Calreticulin is considered to be the major Ca2+-binding protein in the nonmuscle ER(2.Michalak M. Milner R.E. Burns K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Other Ca2+-binding proteins in the lumen of this membrane system include endoplasmin (GRP94), immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP or GRP78), and protein disulfide isomerase. As with calreticulin, these three proteins contain the C-terminal ER retention sequence KDEL preceded by clusters of acidic residues. A role for Ca2+ in the interaction of KDEL proteins with the KDEL receptor has been proposed(3.Kelly R.B. Nature. 1990; 345: 480-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 4.Vaux D. Tooze J. Fuller S. Nature. 1990; 345: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). There is evidence that the four ER proteins might have a similar transcriptional regulation(5.McCauliffe D.P. Yang Y.S. Wilson J. Sontheimer R.D. Capra J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2557-2562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because BiP, GRP94, and protein disulfide isomerase are believed to be involved in protein transport, folding, or assembly(6.Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3573) Google Scholar), a similar role has been considered for calreticulin. Calreticulin can be induced by amino acid deprivation (7.Plakidou-Dymock S. McGivan J.D. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and heat shock(8.Conway E.M. Liu L. Nowakowski B. Steiner-Mosonyi M. Ribeiro S.P. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17011-17016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggesting that calreticulin, like many chaperones, is a stress protein. In addition, several groups have reported that calreticulin binds to a number of proteins isolated from the ER(9.Milner R.E. Famulski K.S. Michalak M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 112: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 10.Burns K. Michalak M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 11.Nigam S.K. Goldberg A.L. Ho S. Rohde M.F. Bush K.T. Sherman M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1744-1749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, calreticulin has sequence similarities with calnexin, a known molecular chaperone. In accordance with these data, a recent study provided evidence that calreticulin serves as a chaperone in the biosynthesis of myeloperoxidase(12.Nauseef W. McCormick S.J. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4741-4747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Here, we show that calreticulin and calnexin bind transiently to glycosylated forms of the integral membrane protein encoded by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Sequential immunoprecipitations suggest the existence of ternary complexes containing calreticulin, calnexin, and the HIV-1 envelope protein.MATERIALS AND METHODSViruses and ReagentsRecombinant vaccinia virus vPE16, which expresses the HIV-1 env gene from a clone of the BH8 isolate(13.Ratner L.

The truncated proteins derived from HIV-1 gp160 (15.Earl P.L. Koenig S. Moss B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 31-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or HIV type 2 gp160 (16.Otteken A. Voss G. Hunsmann G. Virology. 1993; 194: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) were also expressed by recombinant vaccinia viruses. Tunicamycin and castanospermine were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. 1-Deoxynojirimycin, 1-deoxymannojirimycin, and bromoconduritol were purchased from Oxford GlycoSystems (Bedford, MA).Vaccinia Virus Infections, Pulse Labeling, and ImmunoprecipitationsBS-C-1 cells were infected with 10 plaque forming units/cell. At 16 h postinfection, cells were placed in methionine-free medium for 1 h, after which they were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine (600 μCi/ml; Amersham Corp.). One sample was lysed immediately, whereas the others were chased by removing the radioactive medium and replacing it with normal medium supplemented with 20-fold excess cold methionine. Cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 in 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM iodoacetamide, 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged for 10 min. The extract was incubated for 1 h with the appropriate serum, after which protein A-coated Sepharose was added for 30 min. Then the precipitated complexes were washed three times in TNT buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4). All steps were performed at 4°C to maintain the stability of complexes between newly synthesized proteins and calreticulin or calnexin. The rabbit polyclonal serum 2144, raised against the truncated HIV envelope protein gp140, was used as a positive control (kindly provided by C. Broder). Calreticulin-directed serum was purchased from Affinity BioReagents (Neshanic Station, NJ). Serum directed to the C terminus of calnexin was obtained from StressGen (Victoria, Canada).SDS-PAGE and Scanning DensitometrySamples were prepared in Laemmli buffer with 1% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were then separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were scanned with a PhosphorImager from Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA).Western BlottingProteins from extracts of vaccinia virus-infected cells expressing HIV-1 gp160 were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with 1:1000 dilutions of gp160- and calreticulin-directed sera for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated with 125I-labeled protein A (Amersham Corp.) for 45 min and then washed. Proteins were visualized by autoradiography.RESULTSCalreticulin Associates Transiently with Newly Synthesized Cellular ProteinsPrior to studying the specific interaction of calreticulin with the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, we wished to determine if calreticulin associates transiently with polypeptides of the host cell. For this purpose, BS-C-1 cells were biosynthetically labeled for 5 min with [35S]methionine and chased for up to 120 min. Extracts from these cells were incubated successively with calreticulin-directed antiserum and protein A beads. As determined by SDS-PAGE, a large number of different proteins complexed with calreticulin, which has a mass of 60 kDa(9.Milner R.E. Famulski K.S. Michalak M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 112: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The most protein was coprecipitated at 5 min after the pulse, and progressively less protein was coprecipitated with longer chase times (Fig. 1). The chaperone calnexin showed similar transient binding to newly synthesized cellular proteins(17.Ou W.J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Because calreticulin and calnexin share some highly conserved amino acid sequences(1.Nash P. Opas M. Michalak M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 135: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we needed to exclude cross-reactivity of the anti-calreticulin serum with calnexin. For this purpose, lysates of BS-C-1 cells that had been labeled overnight with [35S]methionine were used for immunoprecipitations. The calnexin- and calreticulin-directed sera immunoprecipitated major proteins corresponding to the expected sizes of their target polypeptides as well as minor proteins that were presumably complexed with the chaperones (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). To remove the complexed proteins, the protein A-Sepharose beads were incubated in SDS. Then the supernatants were used for a second round of immunoprecipitation by the same antibodies. As shown, calnexin and calreticulin were specifically immunoprecipitated, and no cross-reactivity of these two sera was detectable (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4).Figure 2:The calreticulin-directed serum showed no cross-reactivity for calnexin. BS-C-1 cells were labeled with [35S]methionine starting 1 h after infection. After approximately 16 h, the cells were lysed, and the extracts were incubated with calnexin-directed serum (lane 1) or with calreticulin-directed serum (lane 2). In lanes 3 and 4, the beads were incubated with SDS to release bound proteins, diluted tenfold in Triton X-containing lysis buffer and used for a second round of immunoprecipitations with anti-calnexin or anti-calreticulin antibodies, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)HIV-1 Envelope Protein Binds Transiently to Calreticulin Early during Its ProcessingTo investigate if calreticulin like calnexin binds transiently to newly synthesized secretory glycoproteins, we used the well studied HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp160 expressed by the recombinant vaccinia virus vPE16(15.Earl P.L. Koenig S. Moss B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 31-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The envelope protein is synthesized as a 160-kDa glycosylated precursor and is subsequently cleaved to gp120 and gp41 subunits in the Golgi. gp160 is processed rather slowly, especially in comparison with the influenza hemagglutinin and vesicular stomatitis virus G protein(18.Earl P.L. Moss B. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2047-2055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is an advantage for the study of transient chaperone-binding. The calreticulin-directed serum coprecipitated gp160 from infected cells as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 3, lane 2). By contrast, when a gp160-directed serum was used, both gp160 and its cleavage product gp120 were detected (Fig. 3, lane 1).Figure 3:Calreticulin complexes with gp160 but not with gp120. BS-C-1 cells infected with vPE16 were harvested at 16 h after infection and lysed. One portion was immunoprecipitated by a gp160-directed serum (lane 1), and one portion by calreticulin-directed serum (lane 2). After separation of the proteins by SDS-PAGE, they were blotted onto nitrocellulose and detected by incubation with both sera followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose labeled with 125I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the time course of gp160 binding by calreticulin, pulse-chase experiments were performed. BS-C-1 cells expressing gp160 were labeled with [35S]methionine for 5 min and chased for times between 0 and 120 min. Immunoprecipitation of extracts from these cells by calreticulin-directed antibodies followed by SDS-PAGE showed that newly synthesized gp160 coprecipitated with calreticulin (Fig. 4A). Quantitation of the radioactivity in the bands revealed that the highest amount of gp160 was bound to calreticulin about 10 min after synthesis (Fig. 4B). After a chase of 25 min, the labeled gp160 bound to calreticulin was reduced by 50%, and by 90 min only trace amounts of gp160 were still associated with calreticulin. In the extracts of cells lysed directly after the 5 min pulse, the amounts of gp160 precipitated by either the calreticulin- or gp160-directed antibodies were less than that after a chase of at least 5 min. The delay could reflect continued incorporation of labeled methionine as well as the time needed for glycosylation(18.Earl P.L. Moss B. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2047-2055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because vaccinia virus infection stops host cell protein synthesis(19.Moss B. J. Virol. 1968; 2: 1028-1037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), metabolically labeled calreticulin was not detected in infected cells (data not shown). Nevertheless, in Western blot of those cells (Fig. 3) or in radioimmunoprecipitation assays of uninfected cells (Fig. 1), calreticulin was easily detectable.Figure 4:Transient binding of calreticulin to gp160. A, BS-C-1 cells at 16 h after infection with vPE16 were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 5 min and chased for the times indicated in min at the top of the figure. Then extracts of the cells were immunoprecipitated by calreticulin-directed or gp160-directed serum, respectively. The resulting immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. B, the amount of radioactivity of each band in A was quantitated with a PhosphorImager.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Calreticulin Binds to the N-terminal 204 Amino Acid Residues of HIV-1 gp160The failure of calreticulin to bind gp120 could result either from the lack of binding sites in the N-terminal portion of gp160 or because cleavage of gp160 to form gp120 occurs after exit from the ER. To differentiate between these possibilities, we infected cells with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing truncated HIV-1 gp160 proteins(15.Earl P.L. Koenig S. Moss B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 31-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extracts of infected cells pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and chased for only 10 min were immunoprecipitated with anti-gp160 or anti-calreticulin serum. Coprecipitation with anti-calreticulin was detected even for the smallest protein comprising only the N-terminal 204 amino acids, less than half of that of gp120 (Fig. 5, right panel, lane 7). Similar results were obtained using a set of HIV type 2 gp160 truncation variants(16.Otteken A. Voss G. Hunsmann G. Virology. 1993; 194: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this case, calreticulin still bound to the N-terminal 198 amino acids (data not shown). Therefore, the failure of calreticulin to bind naturally cleaved gp120 must be due to its formation beyond the ER compartment.Figure 5:Calreticulin binds to truncated HIV-1 gp160. BS-C-1 cells were infected with vaccinia viruses expressing the wild type gp160 (lane 1) and six C-terminally truncated gp160-proteins (lanes 2-7). The cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 15 min and chased for an additional 10 min. Then extracts of the cells were immunoprecipitated by calreticulin-directed or gp160-directed serum, respectively. Resulting immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Calreticulin Does Not Form Stable Complexes with Nonglycosylated gp160 Produced in the Presence of TunicamycinCalnexin binds to the N-linked oligosaccharides of newly synthesized proteins. Tunicamycin, which blocks all N-linked glycosylation, and castanospermine and 1-deoxynojirimycin, which both inhibit glucosidases I and II, were found to hinder the binding of calnexin to VSV G protein or influenza virus hemagglutinin, whereas 1-deoxymannojirimycin, which inhibits the ER α-mannosidase, did not interfere(20.Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 21.Zhang Q. Tector M. Salter R.D. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). It was concluded that calnexin is specific for very early folding intermediates that possess monoglucosylated core glycans(22.Herbert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). To determine if calreticulin would show such a lectin-like binding, we expressed gp160 in the presence of the inhibitors mentioned above as well as bromoconduritol, which inhibits only glucosidase II. Extracts of [35S]methionine-labeled cells were immunoprecipitated by calreticulin-, calnexin-, or gp160-directed antibodies. The mobility differences displayed by the gp160 bands in inhibitor-free controls (Fig. 6, lane -) and castanospermine-, 1-deoxynojirimycin-, bromoconduritol-, and 1-deoxymannojirimycin-treated cells (Fig. 6, lanes CST, dNM, Br, and dMAN, respectively), showed that these compounds inhibited the trimming of N-linked sugars. In the presence of tunicamycin, the HIV-1 protein had increased mobility due to the absence of N-glycosylation. Only tunicamycin totally blocked the coprecipitation of gp160 with calnexin or calreticulin. Although castanospermine had no effect on the amount of gp160 precipitated by anti-gp160 serum, the amounts co-precipitated with calreticulin and calnexin were 15 and 26% of that co-precipitated in the absence of the drug. The other processing blockers had little or no effect (Fig. 6). The differences in the effects caused by castanospermine and 1-deoxymannojirimycin were not surprising even though both compounds affect the same enzymes. Hammond et al.(20.Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) observed that 1-deoxymannojirimycin blocked binding of calnexin to newly synthesized proteins less efficiently than castanospermine, suggesting 1-deoxymannojirimycin is less efficient, as described previously (23.Gross V. Andus T. Tran-Thi T.A. Schwarz R.T. Decker K. Heinrich P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12203-12209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 6:Effects of glycosylation inhibitors on calreticulin binding. The inhibitor tunicamycin (TM, 5 μg/ml), castanospermine (CST, 1 mM), 1-deoxynojirimycin (dNM, 2 mM), bromoconduritol (Br, 1 mM), and 1-deoxymannojirimycin (dMAN, 1 mM) were added to BS-C-1 cells expressing gp160 from the beginning of their depletion for methionine. The cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for 10 min and chased for an additional 10 min. Then extracts of the cells were immunoprecipitated by calreticulin-, calnexin-, or gp160-directed serum, respectively. The resulting immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tunicamycin-treatment of uninfected BS-C-1 cells and immunoprecipitation with calreticulin-directed serum of their [35S]methionine-labeled extracts led to similar results: tunicamycin prevented newly synthesized cellular proteins from binding to calreticulin (not shown).gp160 Is Not Released from Calreticulin in the Presence of ATPA specific property of many chaperones is their ability to bind selectively to unfolded polypeptides and dissociate from them through an ATP-hydrolyzing reaction that is coupled to protein folding (24.Rothman J.E. Cell. 1989; 59: 591-601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). According to recently published results, calreticulin binds to denatured proteins and can be released by the addition of ATP in the presence of divalent cations(11.Nigam S.K. Goldberg A.L. Ho S. Rohde M.F. Bush K.T. Sherman M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1744-1749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We attempted to confirm this using two different approaches. First, gp160-calreticulin complexes were attached to protein A-Sepharose beads, washed three times in TNT buffer, and washed once in 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0. The beads were then incubated in buffer containing 2 mM ATP, 2 mM Mg2+, 0.5 mM Ca2+ or 2 mM Mg2+, 0.5 mM Ca2+ or 2 mM ATP, 2 mM Mg2+, 0.5 mM Ca2+, 2.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA. In addition, one aliquot was incubated without divalent cations, ATP, EDTA, or EGTA. After 30 min at room temperature, the beads were washed and subjected to SDS treatment, PAGE, and autoradiography. The majority of gp160 remained bound to calreticulin despite addition of ATP (not shown). To determine whether the antibodies bound to calreticulin inhibited ATP-mediated release, we incubated the gp160-calreticulin complexes in cell extracts under the four different conditions described above prior to the addition of antibodies. Again, ATP did not induce dissociation of gp160 from calreticulin. Therefore, gp160 was not released from calreticulin by ATP in the presence of Mg2+ and Ca2+, either when the complex was in solution or bound to calreticulin-directed antibodies.Comparison of the Binding Kinetics of Calnexin and Calreticulin to gp160To compare the timing of gp160 binding to calreticulin and to calnexin, additional pulse-chase experiments were performed. BS-C-1 cells expressing gp160 were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 5 min and chased for times between 0 and 120 min. Half of the extracts from these cells were incubated with calreticulin-directed antibodies, and half of them were incubated with anti-calnexin antibodies followed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 7A). Quantitation of the radioactivity in the bands revealed that calreticulin- and calnexin-directed antibodies bound the highest amounts of gp160 at about 5 and 10 min after synthesis, respectively (Fig. 7B). After a chase of 25 min, the number of gp160 molecules bound to calreticulin was reduced by 50%, and after 90 min only trace amounts of gp160 were still associated with calreticulin as described in a preceding section. For calnexin, we found the t1/2 of dissociation to be 35 min. Thus, calreticulin and calnexin bind gp160 during the same period.Figure 7:Comparison of the binding kinetics of gp160 to calnexin and calreticulin. A, BS-C-1 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 5 min and chased for the times indicated in min at the top of the figure. Then extracts of the cells were immunoprecipitated by calreticulin-directed or calnexin-directed serum, respectively. The resulting immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.

Again, BS-C-1 cells expressing gp160 were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 5 min and chased for times between 0 and 60 min. Half of each extract from these cells was depleted of calreticulin-bound gp160 by two successive immunoprecipitations with calreticulin-directed serum prebound to protein A-Sepharose; the other half of each extract was depleted of calnexin-bound gp160 in a similar way. This procedure was followed by incubation of the supernatants with a surplus of protein A-Sepharose to remove remaining antibodies left from the first two rounds of immunoprecipitations. Finally, the samples depleted for calreticulin-bound gp160 were used for an immunoprecipitation by calnexin-directed serum, and the samples depleted for calnexin-bound gp160 were used for an immunoprecipitation by calreticulin-directed serum. We found that extracts depleted of calreticulin-bound gp160 still contained significant amounts of calnexin-bound gp160 (Fig. 8A). However, calnexin-directed serum effectively depleted calreticulin-bound gp160 because only trace amounts of gp160 were still precipitable by anti-calreticulin (Fig. 8A). This result suggests that under our conditions the majority of gp160 molecules that are bound to calreticulin are also bound to calnexin in a transient ternary complex, whereas there are many gp160-calnexin complexes without calreticulin. To rule out the trivial possibility that the calreticulin-gp160 complex was unstable or lost during the anti-calnexin steps, the immunoprecipitations were repeated with unrelated antibodies in the first two rounds (Fig. 8B). After two immunoprecipitations with VSV G protein-directed antibodies, there were still high amounts of calnexin-bound gp160 as well as calreticulin-bound gp160 (Fig. 8B), indicating that the calreticulin-gp160 complexes were not lost during the procedure.Figure 8:Evidence for ternary complexes composed of gp160, calnexin, and calreticulin. A, infected BS-C-1 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 5 min and chased for the times indicated in min at the top of the figure. The cells were lysed, and each extract was divided into two aliquots and bound by calreticulin-directed or calnexin-directed serum that had been attached to protein A-Sepharose beads (row 1). To completely deplete calnexin- or calreticulin-bound gp160 from the cell extract, this procedure was repeated with the supernatants using fresh beads coated with the same respective antibodies (row 2). To remove any free calnexin- or calreticulin-directed antibodies from the supernatants, an excess of protein A-Sepharose was added to each supernatant for 1 h (row 3). Finally, the supernatants depleted of calnexin were used for an immunoprecipitation by anti-calreticulin, and the supernatant cleared from calreticulin was used for an immunoprecipitation by anti-calnexin (row 4). The gp160 associated with the protein A-Sepharose beads at each step was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The gp160 bands or equivalent positions on the gels are shown. The amounts of gp160 co-precipitated with calnexin and calreticulin were quantitated with a PhosphorImager. At the 10- and 15-min chase times, the gp160-calnexin/gp160-calreticulin was 0.043 for the calnexin-gp160 depletion experiment (left panel), and the gp160-calreticulin/gp160-calnexin was 0.17 (at 10 min) or 0.20 (at 15 min) for the calreticulin-gp160 depletion experiment (right panel). B, BS-C-1 cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for 10 min and chased for an additional 10 min. The cells were lysed, and each extract was divided into four aliquots and treated as described in A. Lane I, anti-calreticulin followed by anti-calnexin; lane II, anti-calnexin followed by anti-calreticulin; lane III, anti-VSV G protein followed by anti-calnexin; lane IV, anti-VSV G protein followed by anti-calreticulin. The rows correspond to the same steps as in A.

Rindress D. Cameron P. Ou. W.-J. Doherty II, J.J. Louvard D. Bell A.W. Dignard D. Thomas Q.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19599-19610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence similarity between calnexin and calreticulin suggests that these distinct ER proteins may have common functions. Calnexin associates transiently and selectively with newly synthesized glycoproteins, indicating that it may act as a chaperone(17.Ou W.J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 20.Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9585-9592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, calnexin binds specifically to molecules with monoglucosylated core glycans, consistent with a role in the synthesis and secretion of glycoproteins(22.Herbert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In addition to the structural similarities between calreticulin and calnexin, there have been several reports that calreticulin binds to a wide variety of proteins(9.Milner R.E. Famulski K.S. Michalak M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 112: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 10.Burns K. Michalak M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 11.Nigam S.K. Goldberg A.L. Ho S. Rohde M.F. Bush K.T. Sherman M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1744-1749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including a processing intermediate of myeloperoxidase(12.Nauseef W. McCormick S.J. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4741-4747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To examine the transient association of calreticulin with a newly synthesized integral membrane glycoprotein, we took advantage of the slow processing rate of the well studied HIV envelope glycoprotein gp160(18.Earl P.L. Moss B. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2047-2055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Initially, we checked the binding of our antibodies to calreticulin and calnexin and observed no cross-reactivity. Using coprecipitation assays, we then demonstrated that calreticulin was associated with many newly synthesized proteins. The association was detected after a 5-min pulse with [S35]methionine. This association was found to be transient; almost all of these proteins dissociated from calreticulin within the first 90 min of chase. When we performed similar experiments with extracts of cells expressing gp160, calreticulin coprecipitated with uncleaved gp160 but not with gp120. Most likely, this is the result of different locations of these proteins. Cleavage of gp160 to gp41 and gp120 is a late processing event that occurs in the Golgi(18.Earl P.L. Moss B. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2047-2055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Stein B.S. Engleman E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2640-2649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and calreticulin contains a KDEL sequence and is therefore ER residential.Nauseef et al.(12.Nauseef W. McCormick S.J. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4741-4747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) observed that the nonglycosylated form of the cellular enzyme myeloperoxidase synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin did not interact with calreticulin. We observed the same effect for gp160. It has been reported that the inhibitors of the glucosidases I and II, castanospermine and 1-deoxynojirimycin, block the association of calnexin to newly synthesized proteins(20.Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Later, it was shown that calnexin is specific for monoglucosylated core glycans(22.Herbert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Castanospermine partially blocked the binding of gp160 to calreticulin and calnexin, whereas 1-deoxynojirimycin had little inhibitory effect. Castanospermine showed some inhibition, but even calnexin still bound detectable amounts of gp160 produced in the presence of this inhibitor. However, gp160 is very heavily glycosylated with almost half of the molecular weight of the mature envelope protein derived from the carbohydrate side chains. For this reason, the specific trimming events may not have all been blocked, allowing calnexin to bind. Although clearer data might be obtained with another protein with fewer glycosylation sites, our data suggest that removal of the terminal glucose residues is important for the association of calreticulin to processing intermediates. Otherwise castanospermine would not have reduced its association, as it also did for calnexin.The binding of some chaperones, such as BiP, can be reversed by the addition of ATP(29.Machamer C.E. Doms R.W. Bole D.G. Helenius A. Rose J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6879-6883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nigam et al.(11.Nigam S.K. Goldberg A.L. Ho S. Rohde M.F. Bush K.T. Sherman M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1744-1749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that after applying ER microsomes to columns coated with denaturated proteins, calreticulin but not calnexin was eluted by ATP. In our study we did not observe an ATP-dependent release of calreticulin from gp160 either when the complex was in solution or bound to protein A-Sepharose beads via antibodies. However, it remains possible that additional cofactors necessary for an ATP-induced release of calreticulin were not present in our assay or inactive under the conditions we have used.Taken together, our data add to the suggestion that calreticulin may act as a molecular chaperone. Especially its transient binding to a variety of cellular proteins and gp160 early during their processing and its specific binding to glycosylated proteins confirm this assumption. This role for calreticulin may also explain a recent finding that long term sensitization training in aplysia lead to an increase of the expression of calreticulin. The increase of calreticulin was first detected when the increase in overall protein synthesis reached its peak and the formation of new synaptic terminals became apparent(30.Kennedy T.E. Kuhl D. Barzilai A. Sweatt J.D. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1992; 9: 1013-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because similar findings were published by the same group for BiP(31.Kuhl D. Kennedy T.E. Barzilai A. Kandel E.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1069-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), a chaperone function of calreticulin and BiP might serve to fold proteins necessary for the structural changes characteristic of long term memory.Because of the striking structural and functional similarities between calreticulin and calnexin, we compared the kinetics of gp160 binding to calreticulin with its binding to calnexin and observed similar patterns. About 10 min after synthesis, a maximal amount of gp160 was bound to calnexin and calreticulin and about half remained bound after 25-35 min. The long t1/2 of dissociation is consistent with earlier reports that gp160 is processed rather slowly (18.Earl P.L. Moss B. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2047-2055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ou and co-workers (17.Ou W.J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) showed recently that maximal binding of α1-antitrypsin, complement 3, transferrin, and apolipoprotein B-100 to calnexin occurred 2-10 min after the pulse. This is probably due to the time needed for the translation of nascent polypeptide chains. Recently, it was shown that association of calnexin to newly synthesized hemagglutinin starts when the chains are about half translated(32.Chen W. Helenius J. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6229-6233Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The t1/2 of dissociation of the proteins investigated by Ou et al.(17.Ou W.J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) from calnexin varied between 5 and 35 min.Calnexin coprecipitated gp160 and small amounts of calreticulin (data not shown). This could be explained by the existence of either a ternary complex composed of gp160, calnexin, and calreticulin or of two binary complexes in which calnexin is bound to calreticulin or to gp160. However, the very similar binding kinetics of both chaperones to gp160 suggested the existence of a ternary complex. To prove that both chaperones bind to the same gp160-folding intermediates, extracts of cells were depleted of gp160 bound to calnexin by anti-calnexin antibodies, and the supernatants were assayed for calreticulin-bound gp160 and vice versa. Calnexin-directed serum depleted calreticulin-bound gp160, suggesting the existence of a transient ternary complex composed of gp160, calreticulin, and calnexin. However, calreticulin-directed serum did not efficiently deplete calnexin-bound gp160. We ruled out the possibility that this effect results from differences in the stability of complexes between gp160 and calnexin or calreticulin. We concluded that calreticulin is mostly bound to gp160 molecules that are also bound to calnexin, whereas calnexin-gp160 complexes lacking calreticulin exist. Whether calnexin is required for calreticulin binding to gp160 cannot be deduced from our data. However, because calnexin is a transmembrane protein, whereas calreticulin is lumenal, we consider a model in which calnexin holds the newly translated gp160 in the ER, whereas calreticulin associates with and dissociates from the protein. Alternatively, calnexin may fulfill its role on the parts of nascent proteins associated or close to the ER membrane, whereas the soluble calreticulin may manipulate the lumenal parts of those proteins.

Opas M. Michalak M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 135: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar)). There is over 90% amino acid sequence identity between rabbit, mouse, human, and rat calreticulins(2.Michalak M. Milner R.E. Burns K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Calreticulin is considered to be the major Ca2+-binding protein in the nonmuscle ER(2.Michalak M. Milner R.E. Burns K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Other Ca2+-binding proteins in the lumen of this membrane system include endoplasmin (GRP94), immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP or GRP78), and protein disulfide isomerase. As with calreticulin, these three proteins contain the C-terminal ER retention sequence KDEL preceded by clusters of acidic residues. A role for Ca2+ in the interaction of KDEL proteins with the KDEL receptor has been proposed(3.Kelly R.B. Nature. 1990; 345: 480-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 4.Vaux D. Tooze J. Fuller S. Nature. 1990; 345: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). There is evidence that the four ER proteins might have a similar transcriptional regulation(5.McCauliffe D.P. Yang Y.S. Wilson J. Sontheimer R.D. Capra J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2557-2562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because BiP, GRP94, and protein disulfide isomerase are believed to be involved in protein transport, folding, or assembly(6.Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3573) Google Scholar), a similar role has been considered for calreticulin. Calreticulin can be induced by amino acid deprivation (7.Plakidou-Dymock S. McGivan J.D. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and heat shock(8.Conway E.M. Liu L. Nowakowski B. Steiner-Mosonyi M. Ribeiro S.P. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17011-17016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggesting that calreticulin, like many chaperones, is a stress protein. In addition, several groups have reported that calreticulin binds to a number of proteins isolated from the ER(9.Milner R.E. Famulski K.S. Michalak M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 112: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 10.Burns K. Michalak M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 11.Nigam S.K. Goldberg A.L. Ho S. Rohde M.F. Bush K.T. Sherman M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1744-1749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, calreticulin has sequence similarities with calnexin, a known molecular chaperone. In accordance with these data, a recent study provided evidence that calreticulin serves as a chaperone in the biosynthesis of myeloperoxidase(12.Nauseef W. McCormick S.J. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4741-4747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Here, we show that calreticulin and calnexin bind transiently to glycosylated forms of the integral membrane protein encoded by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Sequential immunoprecipitations suggest the existence of ternary complexes containing calreticulin, calnexin, and the HIV-1 envelope protein."

Activation of this multimolecular enzyme minimally requires assembly at the membrane with flavocytochrome b558 of cytosolic components p47phox, p67phox, and Rac proteins. Rac1 and Rac2 are 92% homologous cytosolic small GTPase proteins. Both Rac1 and Rac2 have been implicated with NADPH oxidase activation in vitro; however, Rac2 is largely predominant in human phagocytes. Here, using the yeast two-hybrid system, we provide data demonstrating in vivo interactions between human p47phox, p67phox, and Rac proteins. Rac proteins interact with p67phox in a GTP-dependent manner, but do not interact with p47phox. Moreover, Rac effector site mutants, which are known to be inactive in NADPH oxidase, lose their interaction with p67phox; Rac2L61 mutant, which has an increased NADPH oxidase affinity, shows an increased affinity for p67phox. Finally, we observe that p67phox interacts 6-fold better with Rac2 than with Rac1. We also show a strong intracellular interaction between p47phox and p67phox. These results indicate that activated Rac can regulate NADPH oxidase by interacting with p67phox and that Rac2 is the main p67phox-interacting GTPase in human cells.

Rac1 and Rac2 are 92% homologous Ras-like proteins, initially isolated from cell cytosol, Rac1 from guinea pig macrophages, and Rac2 from human neutrophils, as the GTP-binding protein enhancing superoxide generation in the cell-free assay(11.Abo A.

The physiological requirement for Rac proteins in NADPH oxidase has then been demonstrated in a whole cell assay, using rac antisense oligonucleotides or a dominant-negative mutant(13.Dorseuil O.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) has been reported to interact with p47phox and p67phox components, and may play the role of a chaperone in the activated complex(19.Fuchs A. Dagher M.C. Vignais P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5695-5697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). How is Rac regulating the NADPH oxidase? Clearly the nucleotide state of Rac proteins controls the activity of NADPH oxidase: there is an absolute requirement for GTP in the cell-free system, GTP-preloaded Rac activates the enzyme, and factors which modulate the GTP/GDP state of Rac also modulate the activation of the enzyme(1.Bokoch G.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 109-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Bcr, a complex protein whose GTPase activating function acts on Rac in vitro, regulates the activation of the enzyme in vivo(20.Voncken J.W. van Schaick H. Kaartinen V.

An intact Rac effector domain is also required for enzyme activation, as shown by the inefficiency of Rac effector mutants in cell-free assays(21.Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A.

It has been reported that Rac2L61, a GTPase-deficient mutant (therefore mainly in the GTP-bound form) has at least a 3-fold enhanced affinity for the enzyme, as compared to wild type or RacV12 proteins(22.Xu X. Barry D.C. Settleman J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23569-23574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both Rac1 and Rac2 proteins are able to activate the enzyme and are roughly equivalent for activation of the recombinant cell-free system(24.Heyworth P.G. Knaus U.G. Xu X. Uhlinger D.J. Conroy L.

However, in the presence of human neutrophil cytosol in the assay, Rac2 was a more potent activator than Rac1(24.Heyworth P.G. Knaus U.G. Xu X. Uhlinger D.J. Conroy L. Bokoch G.M. Curnutte J.T. Mol.

Upon cell stimulation, cytosolic regulatory proteins translocate to the plasma membrane and/or membrane-associated cytoskeleton to form the active enzyme complex(26.Clark R.A. Volpp B.D. Leidal K.G.

Although contradictory data have been published about Rac recruitment at the membrane(32.Le Cabec V. Mohn H. Gacon G. Maridonneau-Parini I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 1216-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), overall it appears that Rac-GTP activates NADPH oxidase at the membrane level (33.Fuchs A. Dagher M.C. Jouan A. Vignais P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and that in whole cells, Rac translocation seems to correlate with enzyme activation(27.Quinn M.T. Evans T.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22095-22098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but direct interactions of Rac proteins with NADPH oxidase components are so far poorly described. After we began this study, Diekmann et al.(21.Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) reported, using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, that Rac1-GTP was able to interact with p67phox through its effector domain, suggesting that p67phox was a molecular target for Rac proteins. However, several points can be raised about this result: a 100 times molar excess of p67phox over Rac recombinant proteins was necessary to observe a rather weak interaction; only Rac1 has been studied even though Rac2, mainly expressed in NADPH oxidase expressing cells, is highly predominant over Rac1 in human phagocytes(34.Abo A. Webb M.R. Grogan A. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 3: 585-591Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 40.Heyworth P.G. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30749-30752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and in a more biological environment, Sf9 cells overexpressing p47phox, p67phox, and p21Rac1, Rac1-p67phoxcomplex was undetectable(33.Fuchs A. Dagher M.C. Jouan A. Vignais P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Another study (41.Prigmore E. Ahmed S. Best A. Kozma R. Manser E. Segal A.W. Lim L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10717-10722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) also very recently reported a weak interaction in vitro between Rac1-GTP and p67phox recombinants proteins. Here, we have used a two-hybrid system in yeast (42.Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4754) Google Scholar, 43.Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc.

Science. 1993; 260: 1338-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar) to study in an intracellular environment, interactions between the three regulatory cytosolic factors, p47phox, p67phox, and p21Rac. Our results provide clear evidence showing that p47phox and p67phox interact in a stable complex, that p67phox is an in vivo target for Rac-GTP, and that Rac2 in a whole cell system, interacts much better than Rac1 with p67phox. In order to investigate protein-protein interactions in the two-hybrid system, we used the yeast strain HF7c (45.Bartel, P. L., Fields, S. (1996) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar) containing two GAL4-inducible reporter genes, HIS3 and LacZ, or the yeast strain L40 (kindly provided by Dr. A. Vojtek) where the same reporter genes are under the control of multicopies of LexA operon(46.Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar). Proteins fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain were expressed from plasmid pGBT10(45.Bartel, P. L., Fields, S. (1996) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Proteins fused to the GAL4 activation domain (GAL4 AD) 1The abbreviations used are: GAL4 ADGAL4 activation domainECLenhanced chemiluminescence. were expressed from plasmid pGAD-GH(47.Hannon G.J. Demetrick D. Beach D. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2378-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Proteins fused to the LexA protein were expressed from either plasmid pBTM116 (46.Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar) or from pVJL10, a derivative of pBTM116 with modified polylinker. 2V. Jung and J. Camonis, unpublished data. HF7c or L40 cells were cotransformed with pairs of two-hybrid plasmids and selected by growth on medium lacking tryptophane and leucine. Cotransformed colonies were patched on the same selective medium and subsequently replicated to test for protein interaction, using β-galactosidase activity assay on filter with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside or using growth in the absence of histidine in the medium, see indications in figure legends(44.Chardin P.

Methods in Yeast Genetics. Revised Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press,, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). GAL4 activation domain enhanced chemiluminescence. Alleles of rac1, rac1-wt, rac1-V12, rac1-V12N17, rac1-V12A35 and rac1-V12A38 have a Ser-189 mutation and are fused to a Myc epitope(49.Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3021) Google Scholar). They were amplified by polymerase chain reaction when necessary and cloned in-frame with LexA protein. p47 phoxand p67phox cDNAs, a gift of Dr. T. Leto, were cloned in-frame with GAL4 DNA binding domain in plasmid pGBT10 and, in-frame with GAL4 AD in plasmid pGAD-GH. Complementary DNA of rac2-V12, rac2-N17, and rac2-L61, amplified by polymerase chain reaction when necessary, were inserted in-frame with LexA protein. In order to insure correct comparisons between rac1 and rac2 alleles, rac1 alleles used for such comparisons (Fig. 4) were reamplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned, without myc-tag and Ser-189 mutation, in-frame with LexA protein. All alleles derived from polymerase chain reaction products were entirely sequenced. Total yeast extracts were prepared in SDS sample buffer according to standard procedures(48.Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Revised Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press,, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar), resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% gel), and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. Blots were processed as described (13.Dorseuil O. Vazquez A. Lang P. Bertoglio J. Gacon G. Leca G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20540-20542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with rabbit anti-LexA antibodies kindly provided by Dr. P. Moreau(50.Moreau P. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 621-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and developed using the ECL detection system (Amersham). In addition to the non-quantitative β-galactosidase test on filter, we used this protocol when enzyme activity needed to be quantified. Cotransformed yeast colonies, grown in selective liquid medium lacking leucine and tryptophan, were harvested while in the exponential growth phase. Similar numbers of cells were processed for the different cotransformed yeasts. Cells were disrupted by vortexing with glass beads, at 4°C in 0.1 M Tris, pH 8. Protein extracts were quantified and used to determine β-galactosidase activity in: 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, and 50 mM β-mercaptoethanol, with O-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside as substrate (0.7 mg/ml final). Reactions were carried out at 30°C, stopped by addition of 250 mM sodium carbonate, and enzyme activity determined by measuring absorbance at 420 nm(51.Kuras L. Thomas D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Linearity of β-galactosidase activity versus quantity of yeast cell extract was checked. Since previous evidence suggested an interaction between p67phox and p47phox(18.Someya A. Nagaoka I. Yamashita T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 29.Park J.W. Ma M. Ruedi J.M. Smith R.M. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17327-17332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we first tested the ability of these two proteins to interact in the two-hybrid system. A plasmid expressing p47phox fused to the GAL4 activation domain and a plasmid expressing p67phox fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain were introduced into yeast reporter strain HF7c(45.Bartel, P. L., Fields, S. (1996) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Transformants were tested for their ability to grow in the absence of histidine. The interaction between a hybrid of SNF1 and a hybrid of SNF4, two yeast proteins known to interact with each other, provided a positive control(42.Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4754) Google Scholar). All transformants grew at similar rates in the presence of histidine, but only cells containing GAL4 AD-p47phox and GAL4 DNA binding domain-p67phox hybrids maintained their growth in the absence of histidine (Fig. 1). The reciprocal combination GAL4 AD-p67phox/GAL4 DNA binding domain-p47phox had the same effect. Growth capacity on medium lacking histidine was not induced when p47phox or p67phox were replaced by SNF1 or SNF4 proteins (Fig. 1). Therefore, we conclude that expression of the reporter gene HIS3 results from the interaction between p47phox and p67phox. This interaction was initially suspected from observations showing that a large protein complex found in phagocyte cytosol contained a fraction of both proteins(18.Someya A. Nagaoka I. Yamashita T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 29.Park J.W. Ma M. Ruedi J.M. Smith R.M. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17327-17332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that p67phox translocation to the membrane depended on the presence of p47phox(52.Heyworth P.G. Curnutte J.T. Nauseef W.M. Volpp B.D. Pearson D.W. Rosen H. Clark R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). A direct interaction between both proteins in cell cytosol, involving SH3 and proline-rich domains of each protein has been observed(30.Leto T.L. Adams A.G. de Mendez I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10650-10654Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 33.Fuchs A. Dagher M.C. Jouan A. Vignais P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 36.Finan P. Shimizu Y. Gout I. Hsuan J. Truong O. Butcher C. Bennett P. Waterfield M.D. Kellie S. J. Biol.

A. 1994; 91: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Consistent with these data, the results of our two-hybrid study provide evidence for the formation of a complex between p47phox and p67phox proteins in the intact cell. They further indicate that this complex is independent of Rac. p47phox-p67phox interactions in the two-hybrid system provide a means for investigating in an intracellular environment how this interaction could be modulated by biological signals. It should be feasible, for example, to stimulate or inhibit in yeast, pathways known to activate NADPH oxidase in phagocytes (protein kinase C activation or arachidonate synthesis) and to analyze their effect on the p47phox-p67phox complex. Interactions between p21Rac and p47phox or p67phox were first investigated using the same two-hybrid system based on GAL4 reconstitution in reporter yeast HF7c. Different alleles of Rac1 were used: Rac1 wild type; Rac1V12, an activated mutant of Rac1 blocked in GTP-bound form; and Rac1V12N17, a dominant-negative mutant of Rac1 blocked in the GDP-bound form(49.Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3021) Google Scholar). Rac proteins undergo an isoprenylation of their C-terminal part, at cysteine 189, which probably allows this cytosolic protein to bind membrane(53.Didsbury J.R. Uhing R.J. Snyderman R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 804-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To avoid decreasing detection sensitivity due to partial membrane localization of proteins in yeast, as already reported in two-hybrid study of Ras-Raf interactions(54.Van Aelst L. Barr M. Marcus S. Polverino A. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6213-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), we tested Rac1 alleles with a serine 189 mutation, thus preventing C-terminal isoprenylation and membrane localization. In the first set of experiments (data not shown) cotransformed colonies expressing the different Rac alleles with p47phox or p67phox proteins were checked for their ability to grow in the absence of histidine. Only transformants expressing Rac1V12 in combination with p67phox showed a significant histidine-independent growth. Although the signal was rather weak, it was significant and suggested that an activated form of Rac1 was required for Rac1-p67phox interaction. To increase signal intensity, we decided to use another yeast two-hybrid system, which in our hands appeared more sensitive. This system, based on LexA DNA binding protein and yeast strain L40 (46.Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar), which carries HIS3 and LacZ as reporter genes, allowed us to make a more detailed analysis of Rac-p67phox interactions. The same Rac1-serine 189 alleles were used as fusion protein with LexA, to look at interactions with p67phox or p47phox fused to the GAL4 activation domain (Fig. 2). The interaction between RasV12 hybrid and c-Raf1 hybrid provided a positive control in L40 cells (Fig. 2B). The various cotransformed cells were able to grow at similar rates in the presence of histidine, indicating no particular toxicity of expressed hybrid proteins. The ability to grow in the absence of histidine was clearly induced when Rac1V12 and p67phox hybrid proteins were coexpressed (Fig. 2A). The “deactivation” of Rac1V12 by the Asn-17 mutation resulted in a dramatic decrease of histidine-independent growth of Rac1V12NI7-p67phox transformants (Fig. 2A). By contrast, Rac1V12-p47phox or Rac1V12NI7-p47phox combinations were completely inefficient in promoting histidine-independent growth (Fig. 2A). These results therefore indicate that only the activated GTP-bound form of Rac1 is capable of interacting with cytosolic regulator of NADPH oxidase, p67phox, but not with p47phox. We also conclude that isoprenylation of the C-terminal part of Rac proteins is not essential for Rac-p67phox interactions, consistent with previous studies of Rac activity in a cell-free system(24.Heyworth P.G. Knaus U.G. Xu X. Uhlinger D.J. Conroy L. Bokoch G.M. Curnutte J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To check for specificity of the interaction, various activated small GTPase proteins were also tested for interaction with p67phox in L40 cells. RasV12, an activated form of Ras, did not interact with p67phox in the assay. Similarly, RhoGV12ΔCAAX, an activated form of RhoG lacking the C-terminal CAAX box, and an activated RhoB mutant, RhoBV14, showed no interaction with p67phox able to stimulate growth in the absence of histidine (Fig. 2B). Activated forms of Rap2 (Rap2V12) and RalA (RalAV23 with 18 C-terminal amino acids deleted) were also negative in a two-hybrid assay with p67phox (not shown). The various GTPases used were able to interact with their own partners (unpublished two-hybrid assays). We conclude that p67phox interacts specifically with the NADPH oxidase activator Rac. To further investigate whether p67phox is a functional target for Rac, we used Rac proteins mutated in the putative effector region (amino acids 32 to 40). Substitutions of conservative residues at codon 35 (Thr → Ala) or codon 38 (Asp → Ala) have demonstrated in Ras studies that the effector domain is crucial for biological effects of Ras and for direct interaction with Raf(55.Zhang X.-F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 56.Warne P.H. Viciana P.R. Downward J. Nature. 1993; 364: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Identical Rac mutants have been shown unable to activate NADPH oxidase in cell-free assays (21.Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 22.Xu X. Barry D.C. Settleman J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23569-23574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we cotransformed cells with p67phox and Rac effector mutants, specifically Rac1V12 with the additional mutation Ala-35 or Ala-38. We observed that the resulting cells almost entirely lose their ability to grow in the absence of histidine (Fig. 2B), showing that interaction of Rac1 with p67phox was strongly impaired by both mutations. It thus indicates that Rac effector domain plays an important role in the interaction with p67phox. In all cases, hybrids of the various GTPases tested were correctly expressed and at similar levels (Fig. 2C). Histidine-independent growth has been reported here as an indication of interactions; however, equivalent induction of the other reporter gene, LacZ, was also detected by β-galactosidase filter assay (not shown). Altogether, these experiments clearly demonstrate that interaction between Rac and p67phox is specific and Rac-GTP dependent and, in addition, involves the Rac effector domain. All these observations correlate directly with functional characteristics of Rac in the NADPH oxidase cell-free system, and thus, bring convincing evidence for p67phox being the Rac-specific effector in NADPH oxidase complex. Our two-hybrid data obtained in an intracellular environment are in full agreement with in vitro results obtained with recombinant proteins and recently published by Diekmann et al.(21.Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and Prigmore et al.(41.Prigmore E. Ahmed S. Best A. Kozma R. Manser E. Segal A.W. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10717-10722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, both sets of results strongly support the view that p67phox is a direct target for Rac in phagocyte NADPH oxidase. To complement our study of Rac-p67phox interaction, we wondered if activated RacL61 mutant, known to have a higher affinity for NADPH oxidase than RacV12 or Rac wild type(22.Xu X. Barry D.C. Settleman J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23569-23574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also had a higher affinity for the p67phox component. L40 cells were cotransformed with p67phox encoding plasmid and plasmids encoding Rac1L61 or Rac1V12 fused to LexA. The Rac1L61 mutant appeared highly toxic in yeast cells. Therefore, although Rac1L61-induced signals appeared stronger than those from Rac1V12 (data not shown), accurate quantification of the difference could not be obtained. Because Rac2 is the predominant Rac protein in human phagocytes (34.Abo A. Webb M.R. Grogan A. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 3: 585-591Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 40.Heyworth P.G. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30749-30752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and because the functional “L61” data were obtained using Rac2 (22.Xu X. Barry D.C. Settleman J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23569-23574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we decided to use Rac2 alleles to further investigate effects of L61 mutation. Activated Rac2V12 (GTP-bound), deactivated Rac2N17 (GDP-bound), or activated Rac2L61 (GTP-bound) mutants, fused to LexA, were coexpressed in L40 cells with p67phox. We observed that the Rac2V12-p67phox combination induced a clear histidine-independent growth (Fig. 3A). Rac2N17 allele expressed concomitantly with p67phox allowed no growth in the absence of histidine as compared to control cells expressing Rac2N17 alone. On the contrary, Rac2L61 mutant induced a highly efficient growth which is clearly stronger than the growth induced by the Rac2V12 mutant. Identical observations were made using the second reporter gene, LacZ, as shown by β-galactosidase filter assays (Fig. 3B). Quantification of interactions by measurement of β-galactosidase activity in a liquid assay showed that Rac2L61-p67phox induced a 6-fold higher signal than Rac2V12-p67phox complex (Fig. 3C). Interactions between Rac2 mutants and p47phox were also checked and have not been detected (data not shown). In all cases the different Rac2 alleles were checked for their expression in yeast and were found to be expressed at similar levels. These observations indicate that Rac2, like Rac1, interacts with p67phox in a GTP-dependent manner, but does not seem to interact with p47phox. They also show that Rac2L61, in an intracellular environment, has a 6-fold higher affinity for p67phox than Rac2V12. This is in agreement with a recently published report showing the higher potency of Rac1L61 recombinant protein to interact with p67phox(41.Prigmore E. Ahmed S. Best A. Kozma R. Manser E. Segal A.W. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10717-10722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and correlates directly with observations on Rac2L61 activity in the cell-free system(22.Xu X. Barry D.C. Settleman J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23569-23574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that Rac2-p67phox interactions were strong and comparable to positive controls but that Rac1-p67phox interactions appeared relatively weak. A more precise comparison of Rac1 and Rac2 affinity for p67phox, using Rac V12 or L61 activated mutants fused to LexA proteins, was made directly on the same experiment. Cells coexpressing Rac1V12 or Rac2V12 and p67phox grew at normal rates in the presence of histidine and were tested for their capacity to grow in the absence of histidine. In several independent experiments, Rac2V12 allowed a much better rate of growth than Rac1V12 (Fig. 4A). Similar observations were made using the other reporter gene, LacZ, as shown by a stronger β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 4B). Quantification of Rac1- and Rac2-p67phox interactions was obtained by measurement of β-galactosidase activity in a liquid assay from the exact same number of cells. We observed that Rac2V12 induced around 6-fold more enzyme activity than Rac1V12 (Fig. 4C). It shows that LacZ reporter gene, as well as HIS3 reporter gene, are both stimulated to higher levels by the Rac2V12-p67phox complex than by the Rac1V12-p67phox complex. Expression of both Rac mutant proteins were checked by Western blot and were found to be similar. We tried further to compare Rac1 and Rac2 affinity for p67phox using the Rac L61 mutants. Again Rac2L61-induced signals appeared clearly stronger; however, due to the high toxicity of Rac1L61 mutant we cannot provide a reliable estimation of this difference. In all, these data indicate that p67phox, in an intracellular environment, has a much better affinity for Rac2 protein than for Rac1 protein. NADPH oxidase activation by small GTPase led to isolation of Rac1 from guinea pig macrophages (11.Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar) and to Rac2 from human phagocytes(12.Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Evans T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1991; 254: 1512-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Whether this difference reflects a species specificity remains to be determined. However, the predominant interaction of p67phox with Rac2 that we observed provide new information relevant to this question. Our data, in combination with the fact that human phagocytes contain predominantly Rac2 rather than Rac1(34.Abo A. Webb M.R. Grogan A. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 3: 585-591Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 40.Heyworth P.G. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30749-30752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), show that the Rac-p67phox interaction in a whole cell environment is almost specific for Rac2 protein. This raises the question of the molecular basis for the difference between Rac2 and Rac1. We showed that the Rac-p67phox interaction involved the Rac GTP-binding site and required the Rac effector domain. Rac2 and Rac1 are almost identical in these areas; however, the C-terminal portions of the two proteins are divergent. This suggests that the basis for the p67phox higher interaction efficiency with Rac2 probably resides in that C-terminal part of Rac2. In the recombinant cell-free system, Rac1 and Rac2 are roughly equipotent in NADPH oxidase activation. However, it has been previously observed that Rac2 was a more potent activator than Rac1 when neutrophil cytosol was present in the assay(24.Heyworth P.G. Knaus U.G. Xu X. Uhlinger D.J. Conroy L. Bokoch G.M. Curnutte J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), thus indicating involvement of additional intracellular factor(s). The yeast cells could also provide such an environment and allow Rac2 to interact more efficiently with p67phox than Rac1. Our data are in favor of p67phox being the Rac target in NADPH oxidase. However, we cannot exclude that, in addition, Rac could directly act on cytochrome b558(23.Freeman J.L. Kreck M.L. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13431-13435Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 40.Heyworth P.G. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol.

Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), that Rac could act through activation of p21-activated kinases (PAK1 and PAK2). Our data in combination with current knowledge on Rac1 function could also suggest that in human neutrophils, Rac2 could have a different function than Rac1: Rac2 regulating NADPH oxidase activity and Rac1 perhaps regulating cytoskeleton modifications. Overall, we conclude that Rac2 can regulate the human NADPH oxidase by interacting in a GTP-dependent manner directly with the p67phox component. The Rac2-p67phox interaction, probably occurring at the plasma membrane level(1.Bokoch G.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 109-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 33.Fuchs A.

https://openalex.org/W1592356588,"We have shown previously that a four-amino acid block residing at positions 266-269 (LPKS) in the intracellular domain of the human interferon-γ (IFN-γ) receptor α chain is critical for IFN-γ-dependent tyrosine kinase activation and biologic response induction. Herein we show that this sequence is required for the constitutive attachment of the tyrosine kinase JAK-1. Using a vaccinia expression system, a receptor α chain-specific monoclonal antibody coprecipitated JAK-1 from cells coexpressing JAK-1 and either (a) wild type IFN-γ receptor α chain, (b) a receptor α chain truncation mutant containing only the first 59 intracellular domain amino acids, or (c) a receptor mutant containing alanine substitutions for the functionally irrelevant residues 272-275. In contrast, JAK-1 was not coprecipitated when coexpressed with a receptor α chain mutant containing alanine substitutions for the functionally critical residues 266-269 (LPKS). Mutagenesis of the LPKS sequence revealed that Pro-267 is the only residue obligatorily required for receptor function. In addition, Pro-267 is required for JAK-1 binding. These results thus identify a site in the IFN-γ receptor α chain required for constitutive JAK-1 association and establish that this association is critical for IFN-γ signal transduction."

Expression of the COOH-terminal Src kinase (Csk), which represses Src kinases, also blocked induction of c-fos transcription by ET-1.

In contrast, Src-induced c-fos transcription required only the CArG cis-element, demonstrating a divergence in signals regulating c-fos transcription. Thus, Src kinases contribute to a nuclear signaling cascade linking an ET-1 receptor to the CArG element of the c-fos serum response element.

In this respect it is clear that different structural domains in CaM contribute quite variably to both the activation and binding of different target enzymes (George et al., 1990; Persechini et al., 1994). For example, it was recently demonstrated that fragments representing the N- and C-terminal lobes of CaM, each of which contains one of the two pairs of EF-hand Ca2+-binding sites in CaM, bind to their respective sites on neural nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase (skMLCK) with affinities differing by a factor of 100 or more between the two enzymes, although the concentrations of intact CaM required for half-maximal activation of these enzyme activities are not significantly different (Persechini et al., 1994). calmodulin rat brain nitric oxide synthase rabbit skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase fragment containing CaM residues 1-75 fragment containing CaM residues 78-148 synthetic skMLCK CaM-binding peptide synthetic nNOS CaM-binding peptide 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. Olwin et al.(1984) and Olwin and Storm(1985) have demonstrated free energy coupling between target and Ca2+ binding to CaM such that the Ca2+-binding affinity of CaM in its complex with the target is increased over what is seen with free CaM in proportion to the relative increase in target binding affinity caused by Ca2+ binding to CaM. Our recent results with CaM tryptic fragments suggest that the free energy coupling associated with Ca2+-dependent binding of CaM to nNOS and skMLCK is not equally distributed among the four Ca2+-binding sites of CaM. As a result, the roles of the two CaM lobes in establishing Ca2+-dissociation and enzyme inactivation rates for the CaM-nNOS and CaM-skMLCK complexes should differ significantly. In this study we have investigated the rates of Ca2+ dissociation from the CaM-nNOS and CaM-skMLCK complexes and the rates of enzyme inactivation associated with this process. We have confirmed substantial differences between the mechanisms of Ca2+ dissociation from the two CaM-enzyme complexes that are attributable to the distinct roles played by the CaM lobes in these complexes. Vertebrate CaM was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described by Persechini et al.(1989). skMLCK was expressed in Sf9 cells and purified as described by Fitzsimmons et al.(1992). nNOS was expressed in HEK A293 cells and purified essentially as described by McMillan et al.(1992). CaM tryptic fragments TRCI and TRCII were generated and purified as described by Persechini et al.(1994). Synthetic peptides; KRRAIGFKLAEVKFSAKLMGQ-amide (nPEP), based on the reported CaM-binding domain in nNOS (Vorher et al., 1993; Zhang and Vogel, 1994), and KRRWKKNFIAVSAANRFKK-amide (skPEP), based on the reported CaM-binding domain in skMLCK (Blumenthal and Krebs, 1987), were commercially synthesized (Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc) and were verified by mass spectrometry. Enzyme inactivation experiments were performed at 25°C with a pneumatically driven three syringe mixing device built and used as described by McCarthy et al.(1994). Reactions containing 1 μM CaM and 650 nM nNOS or 50 nM skMLCK were initiated by adding L-[2,3,4,5-3H]arginine (50,000 cpm/pmol; Amersham Corp.) or [γ-32P]ATP (1000 cpm/pmol; DuPont NEN) to final concentrations of 1.4 μM or 1 mM, respectively. The reaction buffer for both enzyme reactions contained 50 mM MOPS, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 200 μM CaCl2, and 10 mM MgCl2, pH 7.0. For nNOS reactions the buffer also contained 1 μM tetrahydrobiopterin and 100 μM NADPH. Reactions were quenched at the indicated times by addition of 1 volume of either 150 mM phosphoric acid (skMLCK) or 15% trichloroacteic acid (nNOS). Aliquots of the quenched samples were processed to quantitate amounts of product as described previously (Persechini et al., 1994). For measurements of enzyme inactivation rates, samples were quenched at various times after addition of EGTA to a final concentration of 3 mM. Theoretical curves for enzyme inactivation were generated using an integrated rate equation where P is the amount of product, V is the linear enzyme rate prior to EGTA addition, ki is the first-order rate of inactivation after EGTA addition, t is the time after addition of the chelator, and C is the amount of product present when EGTA is added to the reaction mixture. P=Ve−k/(t)k1+Vk1+C(Eq. 1) Curve fitting to data for enzyme inactivation time courses was performed using the Prism software package (GraphPad, Inc.) Presteady-state measurements of changes in quin-2 MF (Molecular Probes) fluorescence observed at 90° to the excitation beam were performed using a stopped-flow fluorimeter with a dead time of 1.5 ms (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, United Kingdom). The quin-2 MF excitation wavelength at 320 nm was obtained using a 0.124-m monochrometer (Farrand Corp.) illuminated by a 100-watt mercury arc lamp. Fluorescence emission from quin-2 MF was isolated with a 520 nm high-pass glass filter (Corion). Four or more stopped-flow time courses of 1024 data points were averaged for each experiment. Data were filtered with a time constant of 0.4 ms and collected with a Nicolet Explorer III digital oscilloscope and finally transferred to a Zenith HL-148 PC for permanent storage and analysis. Observed rate constants were obtained by fitting the data to single or double exponential equations by the method of moments (Dyson and Isenberg, 1971) or using the Prism software package (GraphPad, Inc.). Stopped-flow experiments were performed at 25°C. For measurements of Ca2+ dissociation from CaM-nNOS or CaM-skMLCK complexes, syringe A of the stopped-flow apparatus contained 2 μM CaM, a molar excess of enzyme over CaM, and 50 μM CaCl2. Enzyme was omitted for measurements of Ca2+ dissociation from CaM alone. Syringe B contained 200 μM quin-2 MF. Both syringes contained 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM MOPS, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.0. Similar conditions were used for measurements of Ca2+ dissociation from complexes between nPEP or skPEP and CaM, TRCI, or TRCII except that the concentration of CaM or CaM fragment in syringe A was 6 or 5 μM, respectively. Measurements were made at 2 or more peptide:CaM stoichiometries. Measurements of the decay in intrinsic Trp fluorescence of the CaM-skPEP complex were made under conditions identical to those described above, except the excitation wavelength was 295 nm and fluorescence emission from Trp was isolated with a 320-380 nm band-pass glass filter (Oriel Corp.), and Ca2+ was chelated with EDTA at a final concentration of 1 mM instead of with quin-2 MF. In all cases reactions were initiated by mixing equal volumes from syringe A and B so that the final concentrations of protein, CaCl2, and quin-2 MF were half of their initial values. Calibration of the photomultiplier voltage with respect to increases in Ca2+ was performed by mixing a set of CaCl2 standards with buffer containing the quin-2 MF indicator. This indicator was chosen in preference to quin-2 because of its 5-fold higher affinity for Ca2+ ion (Kd = 25 nM; Haughland (1992)). The dependence of the photomultiplier voltage upon added free Ca2+ was found to be linear with a slope of 57 mV/μM added CaCl2. This slope was used to determine the stoichiometry of Ca2+ release from CaM, TRCII, and TRCI. A reference for Ca2+-free indicator obtained by mixing the indicator with 10 mM EDTA provides an estimate of free Ca2+ in the buffer of 2 μM. Quin-2 has been reported to bind Ca2+ ion with an association rate constant of 7.5 × 108M-1 s-1, so at the final concentration of 100 μM used in stopped-flow experiments the rate of Ca2+ binding to quin-2 would exceed any measurable Ca2+ dissociation rate by at least a factor of 100 (Bayley et al., 1984). 150 mM NaCl was added to experimental buffers to prevent Ca2+-independent interactions between CaM and peptides, which have been reported to occur at lower ionic strengths (Itakura and Iio, 1992). We have found that interactions betwen CaM and a peptide based on the CaM-binding domain in skMLCK are not completely reversed by Ca2+ chelation unless 150 mM NaCl is present. 2A. Persechini, unpublished results. Salt at this concentration does not significantly affect the ability of CaM to activate nNOS or skMLCK activities (data not shown). The rate constant for EGTA-induced inactivation of skMLCK activity we report here (1.0 s-1) is not significantly different from the value of 0.8 s-1 determined by Stull et al.(1985) in the absence of added NaCl. Data for 32P incorporation into peptide substrate by skMLCK are presented in Fig. 1. The time course for this reaction is linear over the experimental interval of 5 s (Fig. 1, inset). Chelation of Ca2+ ion by addition of EGTA 3 s after initiation of the phosphorylation reaction causes a relatively slow inactivation of skMLCK activity (Fig. 1, inset). Fitting data collected during the first 2 s of this inactivation phase gives an inactivation rate constant of 1 s-1 (Fig. 1). As seen with skMLCK activity, nNOS activity is linear over the experimental time interval; however, EGTA addition causes a more rapid inactivation that is too fast to measure. As seen in Fig. 2, an inactivation rate constant of 1 s-1 gives a poor fit to the data. A rate constant of 10 s-1 also appears too slow to describe the inactivation process, while a rate constant of 25 s-1 or greater appears to provide a reasonable fit. Based on this analysis, we conservatively estimate that the rate constant for inactivation of nNOS activity by addition of EGTA is >10 s-1.Figure 2:Inactivation of nNOS activity by EGTA addition. Data are shown for L-[3H]citrulline production catalyzed by nNOS with (■) or without (□) addition of 3 mM EGTA at the indicated time. Concentrations of nNOS and CaM were 650 nM and 1 μM, respectively. The initial Ca2+ concentration was 200 μM. Theoretical curves for enzyme inactivation were calculated according to using rate constants of 1 s-1 (A), 10 s-1 (B), and 25 s-1 (C). Error bars represent the standard error of the mean (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Data for dissociation of Ca2+ ion from the CaM-skMLCK and CaM-nNOS complexes are presented in Fig. 3A. The data are fit well by single exponentials with respective rate constants of 1.6 and 1 s-1. However, the amplitudes of the signals for the two CaM-enzyme complexes are clearly different. For the CaM-skMLCK complex, an amplitude of 2.8 mol of Ca2+/mol of CaM is obtained; the corresponding amplitude for the CaM-nNOS complex is 1.9 mol of Ca2+/mol of CaM (Fig. 3A). Data for Ca2+ release from free CaM are fit by a single exponential with a rate constant of 12.6 s-1 and an amplitude of 1.9 mol of Ca2+/mol of CaM. In contrast with free CaM or the CaM-enzyme complexes, we were able to observe Ca2+ dissociation from all four Ca2+-binding sites in the CaM-peptide complexes. Data for Ca2+ release from the CaM-nPEP and CaM-skPEP complexes are presented in Fig. 3B. Data for only the first 3 s are shown so that the fast phase of Ca2+ release from CaM-nPEP can be seen. Data for Ca2+ release from CaM-nPEP are fit by a double exponential with rate constants of 1 and 17.7 s-1, and amplitudes of 1.8 and 2.1 mol of Ca2+/mol of CaM, respectively (Fig. 3B). Data for CaM-skPEP are fit by a double exponential with rate constants of 0.15 and 1.9 s-1 and amplitudes of 2.8 and 0.9 mol of Ca2+/mol of CaM, respectively (Fig. 3B). In an attempt to match observed Ca2+ dissociation rates with one or the other of the two CaM lobes, we investigated the kinetics of Ca2+ release from TRCI or TRCII either alone or in the presence of a molar excess of nPEP or skPEP. Data for dissociation of Ca2+ ion from free TRCII are fit by a single exponential with a rate constant of 16 s-1 and an amplitude of 2 mol of Ca2+/mol of TRCII; Ca2+ release from free TRCI is too fast to measure. In the presence of a molar excess of skPEP, Ca2+ release from TRCII is described by a single exponential with a rate constant of 0.34 s-1 and an amplitude of 2 mol of Ca2+/mol of TRCII. Under these conditions, release of Ca2+ ion from the TRCI is described by a single exponential with a rate constant of 4.3 s-1 and an amplitude 2.1 mol of Ca2+/mol of TRCI (Fig. 4). In the presence of a molar excess of nPEP, Ca2+ release from TRCII is described by a single exponential with a rate constant of 1.1 s-1 and an amplitude of 2.2 mol of Ca2+/mol of TRCII. Release of Ca2+ ion from the TRCI under these conditions is described by a single exponential with a rate constant of 100 s-1 and an amplitude of 1.8 mol of Ca2+/mol of TRCI (Fig. 4). It is well established that on binding CaM the single Trp residue in skPEP undergoes a fluorescence enhancement and its emission wavelength is blue-shifted due to its interaction with the C-terminal lobe in CaM (Blumenthal and Krebs, 1987; Ikura et al., 1992). We therefore examined the rate of decrease in Trp fluorescence seen during Ca2+ release from the CaM-skPEP complex. We found this process to be described by a single exponential with a rate constant of 0.22 s-1 (data not shown). We have found that, when CaM is complexed with skMLCK, the apparent Ca2+ dissociation rate constant for two sites in CaM is reduced from 12.6 to 1.6 s-1 and the rate constant for 1 site is reduced from > 1000 s-1 to 1.6 s-1. With the CaM-nNOS complex, there is a similar reduction in the Ca2+ dissociation rate of the two more slowly dissociating sites (Table 1). Our results indicate that the kinetic mechanisms for Ca2+ release from the CaM-enzyme complexes are established by interactions present in both the CaM-enzyme and CaM-peptide complexes. Hence, the CaM-peptide complexes provide models for elucidating the structural basis for the distinct mechanisms of Ca2+ release followed by CaM-nNOS and CaM-skMLCK.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Kasturi et al.(1993) have determined the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from the complex between wheat germ CaM and avian gizzard myosin light chain kinase using a quin-2 indicator. These investigators have reported that the rate of Ca2+ release from free wheat germ CaM is decreased 5-fold when it is bound to the gizzard kinase; a similar decrease was reported to occur when CaM is complexed with mellitin (Kasturi et al., 1993). Although no attempt to determine Ca2+ release stoichiometries was made, it was reported that the amplitude for the observed quin-2 fluorescence transient is increased 2-fold when CaM is complexed with gizzard myosin light chain kinase (Kasturi et al., 1993). These observations suggest that the properties of the CaM-gizzard myosin light chain kinase complex with respect to Ca2+ release and inactivation are likely to be similar to what we report here for the CaM-skMLCK complex. In order to locate the observed Ca2+-binding sites in CaM-nNOS or CaM-skMLCK in one or the other of the two CaM lobes, we determined Ca2+ dissociation rates for the complexes between TRCI or TRCII and either of skPEP or nPEP. We used the CaM-peptide complexes for these determinations because they follow kinetic patterns similar to those seen with the CaM-enzyme complexes (3 slow + 1 fast for CaM-skMLCK and 2 slow + 2 fast for CaM-nNOS), but slower dissociation rates allow all four Ca2+-binding sites in CaM to be observed. Dissociation of 2 Ca2+ ions from the TRCII-nPEP complex occurs with an apparent rate constant essentially identical to the slower Ca2+ dissociation rate constant for the CaM-nPEP complex (Table 1). Two Ca2+ ions dissociate from the TRCI-nPEP complex with an apparent rate 5-fold faster than the faster rate for the CaM-nPEP complex (Table 1). These observations indicate that the more slowly dissociating pair of sites in the CaM-nPEP and CaM-nNOS complex is located in the C-terminal CaM lobe. Analysis of the CaM-skPEP complex is complicated by the observation that 3 Ca2+ ions dissociate with a single apparent rate: 2 from one CaM lobe and 1 from another (Table 1). Ca2+ dissociation from the TRCII-skPEP complex occurs with a rate 2-fold faster than the slower rate for the CaM-skPEP complex and 5-fold slower than the faster dissociation rate for this complex (Table 1). Ca2+ dissociates from the TRCI-skPEP complex twice as fast as the faster rate for the CaM-skPEP complex and 10-fold faster than the slower dissociation rate for this complex (Table 1). This suggests that two of the three more slowly dissociating Ca2+-binding sites in the CaM-skPEP or CaM-skMLCK complexes are located in the C-terminal lobe of CaM. Similarly to what we report here, Suko et al.(1986) and Itakura and Iio(1992) have reported that CaM binding to mellitin reduces the Ca2+ dissociation rates for all four sites in CaM, with the more slowly dissociating sites localized in the C-terminal lobe of CaM. Inactivation of the CaM-dependent skMLCK activity upon removal of Ca2+ ion occurs with a rate constant of 1 s-1; inactivation of CaM-dependent nNOS activity is too fast to measure (>10 s-1). Dissociation of the CaM-skMLCK complex has been reported to occur with an apparent rate constant of 2 s-1 (Johnson et al., 1981), and kinetic measurements of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence suggest that the CaM-skPEP complex dissociates at a rate of 0.22 s-1, close to the slow rate for Ca2+ release from this complex (Table 1). These observations suggest that slow release of 3 Ca2+ ions from the two CaM lobes in a concerted manner is coupled to both inactivation and dissociation of the CaM-skMLCK complex. Inactivation of CaM-nNOS catalytic activity occurs at least 10-fold faster than the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from the two sites in the C-terminal lobe of CaM in this complex. This suggests that Ca2+ dissociation from the N-terminal lobe of CaM is coupled to inactivation of nNOS activity, while dissociation of Ca2+ from the C-terminal lobe is coupled to dissociation of the CaM-nNOS complex. This is consistent with the apparent dissociation constant of 10 nM for the (Ca2+)2TRCII-nNOS complex (Persechini et al., 1994). Given a probable association rate of 107M-1 s-1 (Bowman et al., 1992; Meyer et al., 1992; Kasturi et al., 1993), then when saturated with Ca2+ ion the C-terminal lobe in CaM would be expected to dissociate from nNOS with a rate constant of 0.1 s-1, 10-fold slower than the rate constant for Ca2+ release from this lobe. This study demonstrates substantial differences between the CaM-skMLCK and CaM-nNOS complexes with respect to the kinetic mechanisms for Ca2+ dissociation and associated inactivation of enzyme activity. These differences reflect the different contributions of the two CaM lobes to the stabilities and catalytic activities of these complexes (Persechini et al., 1994). A surprising aspect to these results is the observation that 3 Ca2+ ions dissociate from the CaM-skMLCK complex in a concerted manner. This may be a reflection of interactions between the CaM lobes that are evident in the complex between CaM and a peptide based on the CaM-binding domain in skMLCK (Ikura et al., 1992). Alternatively, it may be due to slowing of the dissociation rate for one Ca2+ from the N-terminal lobe due to specific interactions between this lobe and the peptide sequence. The differences between the CaM-skMLCK and CaM-nNOS complexes we report here indicate that these enzyme activities have distinct spatio-temporal distributions in response to waves in the intracellular Ca2+ ion concentration. This is an important dimension to our understanding of CaM function, further illuminating how this seemingly simple protein might shape complex and subtle cellular responses. We thank Robert Paresi for assistance with expression and purification of skMLCK and nNOS."

https://openalex.org/W1489534411,"When chaperonins GroEL and GroES are incubated under functional conditions in the presence of ATP (5 mM) and K+ (150 mM), GroEL-GroES complexes appear in the incubation mixture, that are either asymmetric (1:1 GroEL:GroES oligomer ratio) or symmetric (1:2 GroEL:GroES oligomer ratio). The percentage of symmetric complexes present is directly related to the [ATP]/[ADP] ratio and to the K+ concentration. Kinetic analysis shows that there is a cycle of formation and disappearance of symmetric complexes. A correlation between the presence of symmetric complexes in the incubation mixture and its rhodanese folding activity suggests some active role of these complexes in the protein folding process. Accordingly, under functional conditions, symmetric complexes are found to contain denatured rhodanese. These data suggest that binding of substrate inside the GroEL cavity takes place before the symmetric complex is formed."

Its concentration in cells is important for the normal development of the central nervous system, and perhaps other physiological processes.

These fragments were present in significant concentrations in quiescent fibroblasts; they disappeared, and the amount of intact MARCKS increased, within 15 s of activation of protein kinase C by serum.

MARCKS and its relative, the MARCKS-related protein (also known as F52 or MacMARCKS) comprise a family of heat-stable, acidic proteins that are characterized by several common properties. These include three highly conserved regions within the primary protein sequence: The amino-terminal sequence, which is responsible for directing myristoylation; a short sequence of identity to the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor which surrounds the splice site of the single known intron; and an internal highly basic domain of 25 amino acids containing the PKC phosphorylation sites. This basic phosphorylation site domain (PSD) is also the binding site for calmodulin; this occurs in a calcium-dependent fashion and is inhibited by PKC phosphorylation(3.Graff J.M. Young T.N. Johnson J.D. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21818-21823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PSD also has been implicated in binding to cytoskeletal actin, again in a phosphorylation- and calmodulin-dependent manner(4.Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar).

Although the precise cellular function of MARCKS remains obscure, recent data from gene targeting experiments in the mouse indicate that it is necessary for normal development of the central nervous system, as well as extrauterine life(5.Stumpo D.J. Bock C.B. Tuttle J.S. Blackshear P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Abnormalities seen in the MARCKS-deficient pups include exencephaly, agenesis of the corpus callosum and other forebrain commissures, failure of hemisphere fusion, and lamination abnormalities of the cerebral cortex and retina. The molecular basis of these abnormalities is not known; however, heterozygous mice expressing 50% of wild-type MARCKS levels are phenotypically normal, suggesting that a certain threshold MARCKS concentration is necessary for these developmental processes to occur normally. For these and other reasons, regulating MARCKS protein concentrations in cells is important. In general, MARCKS protein concentrations closely parallel its mRNA levels; these can in turn be regulated at the level of gene transcription. For example, tumor necrosis factor α and lipopolysaccharide can cause dramatic increases in the levels of MARCKS mRNA and protein in neutrophils, macrophages, and related cells(6.Thelen M. Rosen A.

At the post-transcriptional level, MARCKS mRNA and protein are decreased in Swiss 3T3 cells in response to several hours of exposure to phorbol esters, bombesin, platelet-derived growth factor, and agents that elevate cAMP(14.Brooks S.F. Herget T. Erusalimsky J.D. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2497-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 15.Brooks S.F. Herget T. Broad S. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 24-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported rapid decreases in MARCKS protein levels after short-term (less than 15 min) exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). One means of controlling MARCKS protein levels is by specific proteolysis, perhaps regulated by some of the stimuli enumerated above. In the present study, we show that MARCKS can be cleaved into two major fragments that achieve significant concentrations in some cells and tissues. This cleavage is prevented by PKC-dependent phosphorylation of MARCKS. The putative protease involved is present in many cells and tissues, appears to be a cysteine protease, and cleaves MARCKS at a site between asparagine 147 and glutamate 148 in the bovine sequence, three amino acids amino-terminal to the PSD. These results indicate that MARCKS levels in cells can be controlled by a specific protease, whose proteolytic efficacy is dependent on the phosphorylation state of its substrate. They also raise the interesting possibility that MARCKS can physically associate with this uncharacterized protease, perhaps even regulating its activity toward other substrates. Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF, Clonetics Corp., San Diego, CA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies).

To serum starve cells, confluent cultures were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline and the medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM supplemented as above except that it contained 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA, lyophilized and crystallized; Sigma). To label with L-[35S]cysteine, DMEM lacking cysteine and methionine was supplemented with 0.1% BSA, glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin as above and 10 mM methionine. L-[35S]Cysteine (DuPont NEN Research Products, Boston, MA) was added at 0.05-0.2 mCi/ml. To label with L-[35S]methionine, DMEM lacking cysteine and methionine was supplemented with 0.1% BSA, glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin as above and 20 mM cystine. L-[35S]Methionine (DuPont NEN) was added at 0.1 mCi/ml. To label with L-[14C]alanine, DMEM was supplemented with 0.1% BSA, glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin as above with L-[14C]alanine (DuPont NEN) at 5 μCi/ml. Cells were serum starved and radiolabeled for 16 h. Following the overnight incubation, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO, Sigma), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma), or serum was added directly to the medium. A 16 mM stock of PMA was made in Me2SO followed by a 1:100 dilution in 0.1% BSA-containing DMEM; this was then added immediately to the medium at a 1:100 dilution resulting in a final concentration of 1.6 μM. As a control, Me2SO was diluted similarly and added to the cells such that the final amount of Me2SO was 0.01% in both control and PMA-treated cells. Fetal calf serum was added directly to medium at a 1:10 dilution. Cells were incubated at 37°C in a water-jacketed incubator supplemented with 5% CO2. Following radiolabeling and hormonal stimulation, the cells were placed on ice, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10% glycerol (v/v), 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 1 mM EDTA, and 150 mM salt. Depending on the experiment, either 150 mM NaCl or 100 mM NaCl plus 50 mM NaF was used. A protease mixture containing 200 nM aprotinin, 1 mM benzamidine-HCl, 2 μM leupeptin, 1 μM pepstatin, and 574 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to the lysis buffer. When the specificity of the protease inhibitors was evaluated, each protease inhibitor was added separately to the lysis buffer. One ml of lysis buffer was used on 100-mm dishes and 0.5 ml of lysis buffer was used on 60-mm dishes. Cells were scraped using a rubber policeman and collected into a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube. Depending on the experiment, the cell extracts were subjected to clarification with or without prior boiling. For non-boiled samples, lysates were tumbled at 4°C for 20 min followed by centrifugation at 13,500 × g for 10 min at 4°C. For boiled samples, lysates were boiled for 10 min, placed on ice for 10 min and then clarified by centrifugation at 13,500 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Clarified lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation. For lysates from HFF cells that had been boiled prior to clarification, further preclearing was unnecessary. For boiled lysates from LM/TK- cells and non-boiled lysates from HFF cells, lysates were precleared by incubation with a 1:100 dilution of nonimmune control antibody and tumbling at 4°C for 1 h. In the case of samples immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies, a secondary rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (2 mg/ml; Pierce) was added at a 1:00 dilution followed by tumbling at 4°C for 1 h. Protein A-Sepharose, 0.1 g, (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway, NJ), washed and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer, was then added at a 1:10 dilution and samples were tumbled for 1 h at 4°C. Protein A-Sepharose was sedimented by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 3 min and the supernatants subjected to further immunoprecipitation. Samples that were precleared by boiling or by treatment with nonimmune antibodies were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 1:100 dilutions of the appropriate antibodies and tumbled at 4°C overnight. When competing peptides were used, an equal volume of antibody and 5 mM solutions of the peptides were mixed and incubated for 1 h at 4°C prior to adding to precleared lysates. In the case of immunoprecipitations with monoclonal antibodies, lysates were treated with a rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody as described above. All samples were treated with a 1:10 dilution of protein A-Sepharose as described above. Protein A-Sepharose was precipitated by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 3 min and the supernatants were discarded. The pellets were washed three times with 0.5-1 ml of lysis buffer followed by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 3 min. The final protein A pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer containing 10% sucrose (w/v), 100 mM dithiothreitol, 1.2% SDS (w/v), 12 mM EDTA, and 0.0012% (w/v) Pyronin Y and boiled for 3 min. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were fixed in 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid for 20 min, rinsed extensively with water for 20 min, and treated with Autofluor (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) for 20 min. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat XAR film at −70°C. Construction of wild-type and mutant bovine MARCKS cDNA constructs were as described previously(2.Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Swierczynski S.L. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol.

Mutations used for this study included replacement of the amino-terminal glycine with alanine, and replacement of the four serines within the PSD with aspartic acid, asparagine, glycine, or alanine. Messenger RNA was transcribed in vitro as described previously(19.Swierczynski S.L. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13436-13445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The resulting mRNA was translated in vitro using 50 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI), 2-4 μg of mRNA, and 25 μCi of [35S]cysteine with incubation at 30°C for 1 h. In certain instances, the translation reaction was diluted with phosphate-buffered saline to 0.5 ml, and a clarified supernatant was prepared by boiling for 10 min, incubation on ice for 10 min, and centrifugation at 107,000 × g for 40 min at 4°C. Boiled and cleared translation reactions were subjected to phosphorylation with the catalytic fragment of PKC, protein kinase M (PKM). Translated proteins were incubated with 40 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 75 μM ATP, 1 mM EGTA, and 1/120 dilution of purified PKM(20.Graff J.M. Rajan R.R. Randall R.R. Nairn A.C. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14390-14398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were incubated at 30°C for 30 min, then used directly as substrates for proteolysis with HFF lysates. To analyze the protease activity in whole cell lysates, lysates were prepared as described above for immunoprecipitations, except that the cells were serum starved in the absence of isotope, and the lysates were prepared in the absence of protease inhibitors. To analyze the ability of lysates to proteolyze wild-type or mutant MARCKS translation reaction products, 100 μl of buffer or lysate was mixed with 15 μl of undiluted translation reaction. To analyze the effect of specific protease inhibitors, 25 μl of diluted and clarified translation reaction was mixed with 100 μl of lysate with the addition of specific inhibitors. To analyze the effect of phosphorylation on in vitro translated products, 25 μl of diluted clarified and phosphorylated translation product was mixed with 100 μl of lysate. All reactions were incubated at 30°C for 30 min followed by the addition of 30 μl of a 5 times concentrated SDS sample buffer (final concentrations described above). Samples were boiled and then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were fixed, treated with Autofluor, and exposed to film as described above. Bovine tissue was obtained fresh from the slaughterhouse, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen, kept on dry ice during transport, and stored at −135°C. Approximately 0.5-1 g of frozen tissue was ground into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle in the presence of liquid nitrogen. The powder was thawed and homogenized using a Teflon-glass homogenizer in 2 ml of ice-cold 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, pH 8.1, containing 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, and protease inhibitors as described above except at 2-fold higher concentrations. Homogenization involved 5 up and down strokes with the Wheaton overhead stirrer set at 6. Volumes were brought up to 3 ml with buffer, and Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 1% (v/v). The samples were then incubated on ice for 1 h, followed by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were boiled for 10 min, incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 13,500 × g for 1 h. Protein concentrations in the remaining supernatants were determined by Bio-Rad assay (Bio-Rad). To analyze for the presence of MARCKS in bovine tissues, 100 (spleen and brain) or 400 (liver and kidney) μg of heat-stable protein was boiled with SDS sample buffer for 3 min and separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schuell) in 192 mM glycine, 25 mM Tris, and 20% (v/v) methanol using a Hoefer Transphor apparatus. All steps in the following immunoblotting method were performed at room temperature. Nonspecific sites on filters were blocked by incubation and shaking for 1 h with 5% (w/v) instant milk in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.6, containing 137 mM NaCl and 0.3% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST). Filters were briefly rinsed with TBST followed by incubation with primary antibody at a 1:100 dilution in TBST for 1-2 h with shaking. Filters were rinsed three times by shaking in TBST for 10 min each time. The filters were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) at a 1:5000 dilution in TBST for 30 min with shaking. Filters were again rinsed three times in TBST for 10 min each time. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham) following the manufacturer's instructions. Boiled supernatants from bovine spleen were further purified by fractionation over a Mono Q anion exchange column (Pharmacia) as described previously(21.Verghese G.M. Johnson J.D. Vasulka C. Haupt D.M. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9361-9367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assay for the presence of p40, aliquots of fractions were boiled with SDS sample buffer for 3 min and separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose filters and analyzed by Western blot analysis as described above. Fractions positive for p40 were pooled and lyophilized. The combined fractions were resuspended in SDS sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) as described above for nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were stained for 5 min with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue in 50% methanol, followed by destaining with 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid. A slice of filter containing p40 was subjected to Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) sequencer, model 470A. These experiments were initially designed to identify novel proteins associated with MARCKS and to determine whether or not the association of these proteins was regulated by PKC-mediated phosphorylation of MARCKS. We therefore analyzed radiolabeled proteins potentially associated with MARCKS after immunoprecipitation of whole cell lysates using MARCKS-specific antibodies. For most of these studies a monoclonal antibody, 2F12, was used. This was generated against purified, recombinant human MARCKS and its epitope has been mapped to the carboxyl terminus of MARCKS. 2P. J. Blackshear, unpublished observations. Human fibroblasts, serum starved and radiolabeled overnight with L-[35S]cysteine, were stimulated with Me2SO or PMA for 10 min followed by immunoprecipitation of cell lysates under low-stringency conditions. A radiolabeled protein band corresponding to MARCKS was present in lysates from both Me2SO and PMA-stimulated cells, and was specifically immunoprecipitated by 2F12 and not by a control monoclonal antibody, 6F6 (Fig. 1). In addition, 2F12 specifically immunoprecipitated a 35S-labeled protein of approximately 40 kDa (p40) that was present in lysates from Me2SO-treated cells but absent in lysates from PMA-stimulated cells. In analogous experiments using polyclonal antibodies generated against a peptide representing the first 15 amino acids of MARCKS(22.Lobaugh L.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18393-18399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), MARCKS was detected in the immunoprecipitates from both PMA-stimulated and control cells. However, in contrast to the data shown in Fig. 1 using the carboxyl-terminal specific antibody, no band migrating at 40 kDa was detected (data not shown). We performed several experiments to determine whether p40 was a MARCKS-associated protein or a carboxyl-terminal fragment of MARCKS. MARCKS lacks methionines in the mature protein since the initiator methionine is processed off during co-translational myristoylation of the amino terminus. HFF were therefore serum-starved and radiolabeled with [35S]methionine overnight, followed by Me2SO and PMA treatment. Immunoprecipitation of these lysates with 2F12 did not result in the detection of a p40 (Fig. 2A, lanes 1-4), despite immunoprecipitation of p40 after [35S]cysteine labeling in a parallel experiment (Fig. 2A, lanes 5-8). The lack of p40 labeling by [35S]methionine supported the possibility that p40 was a carboxyl-terminal fragment of MARCKS or a MARCKS-like protein and argued against p40 being a MARCKS-associated protein. To further confirm that p40 was a fragment of MARCKS or a MARCKS-like protein we took advantage of the heat stability of MARCKS. In the event that an associated protein was itself heat stable, it seemed unlikely that the putative association of this protein with MARCKS would withstand boiling. MARCKS-containing lysates from [35S]cysteine-labeled HFF were boiled for 10 min followed by precipitation of the denatured proteins. MARCKS remains soluble and immunoreactive following this procedure. Fig. 2B shows an autoradiograph of proteins present in immunoprecipitates of boiled and cleared lysates. Boiling removed most of the nonspecific bands detected in immunoprecipitates of non-boiled lysates. Full-length MARCKS was readily detected in immunoprecipitates from Me2SO- and PMA-treated cells. In addition, a 35S-labeled protein migrating similarly to p40 was seen in the immunoprecipitates of lysates from Me2SO-treated but not PMA-treated cells. The presence of p40 in the immunoprecipitates of boiled lysates supports the possibility that this protein is a fragment of MARCKS or a MARCKS-like protein, rather than an associated protein. To determine whether the presence of p40 in 2F12 immunoprecipitates was dependent upon the presence of MARCKS in the lysates, cells lacking MARCKS were tested for the presence of p40. LM/TK- fibroblasts, a mouse cell line that lacks endogenous MARCKS, were stably transfected with either vector alone or a plasmid expressing full-length bovine MARCKS, which cross-reacts with the 2F12 antibody.2 Immunoprecipitations using 2F12 resulted in the presence of p40 only in cells expressing bovine or human MARCKS, and not in cells lacking MARCKS (Fig. 2C). Taken together with the previous data, these findings indicated that p40 was probably a carboxyl-terminal fragment of MARCKS. We also wished to determine if a corresponding amino-terminal fragment of MARCKS could be detected whose formation was prevented by activation of PKC. Only three cysteines are present in human MARCKS and these all reside very close to the carboxyl terminus; therefore, an amino-terminal fragment would not be detected following [35S]cysteine labeling of cells and immunoprecipitation with the amino-terminal specific antibody. However, when the cells were radiolabeled with [14C]alanine, full-length MARCKS as well as a smaller protein were precipitated with the amino-terminal antibody (Fig. 3). This smaller protein or protein fragment was present only in unstimulated cells and not in PMA-stimulated cells. This smaller fragment migrated as a diffuse band of Mr~ 44,000. When similar immunoprecipitations were done in the presence of competing peptide, both intact MARCKS and the entire diffuse band were competed by the peptide (Fig. 3). In addition, this same diffuse band was detected when HFF were labeled with [3H]myristate and the lysates subjected to immunoprecipitation with the amino-terminal MARCKS antibody (data not shown). These data indicate that the diffuse band at Mr~ 44,000 is an amino-terminal fragment of MARCKS, whose formation is also prevented by PMA-stimulation of the cells (Fig. 3). The sum of the Mr of both the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal fragments add up to the apparent Mr of full-length MARCKS. Interestingly, both fragments migrated anomalously on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, as does full-length MARCKS. To establish that the disappearance of p40 in the immunoprecipitates from PMA-stimulated cells was not an artifact of nonphysiological activation of PKC by this phorbol ester, HFF were stimulated with 10% fetal calf serum as a source of physiological growth factors (Fig. 4). Both full-length MARCKS and p40 were detected in similar amounts in immunoprecipitates of lysates from from either untreated cells or cells treated with Me2SO, but only full-length MARCKS was detected in cells stimulated with serum between 15 s and 2 min. p40 began to reappear 5-10 min following serum addition (Fig. 4). The identity of the band appearing at 5 min as p40 was confirmed by competition experiments with the epitope-specific peptide (data not shown). The disappearance of p40 thus occurs in response to physiological activators of PKC as well as with PMA. We next assayed for the presence of a cellular protease that could cleave endogenous MARCKS and generate p40. Lysates were prepared from control and PMA-treated [35S]cysteine-labeled cells in the presence or absence of protease inhibitors; the lysates were then incubated at 30°C for varying times. The reactions were stopped by boiling the samples, and equal amounts of trichloroacetic acid precipitable radioactivity were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 2F12. Almost all full-length MARCKS had disappeared after 20 min of incubation of lysates prepared from control cells and incubated in the absence of protease inhibitors (Fig. 5A, lanes 1-3). There was a concomitant increase in the amount of radiolabeled p40 in the lysates. In contrast, no changes in the amounts of full-length MARCKS or p40 were detected in lysates prepared from control cells incubated in the presence of protease inhibitors at 30°C (Fig. 5A, lanes 4-6). In fact, the disappearance of full-length MARCKS an"

The 71-kDa gene product appears to be post-translationally modified to produce a second DMK form with an apparent molecular mass of 84 kDa.2 Structural predictions from the primary sequence suggest that DMK consists of an amino-terminal kinase domain, an α-helical coiled-coil domain, and a carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domain(12.Perryman M.B.

DMK mRNA is present in a variety of tissue types, including muscle, brain, and eye. Quantitation of DMK mRNA concentrations from alleles with expanded triplet repeats in affected individuals has proven difficult, leading to conflicting reports as to expression of mutant alleles(14.Fu Y.-H.

The disease state of DM is likely to be related to the aberrant expression of DMK and the subsequent failure of the kinase to act upon its proper substrates or ectopic interaction with other substrates. In an effort to establish whether DMK operates within a known signal transduction pathway, we constructed stably transfected BC3H1 muscle cell lines that constitutively overexpress human DMK. DMK-expressing and untransfected cells were cultured in the presence of 20% fetal calf serum; differentiated BC3H1 cells were produced by mitogen withdrawal. Total cellular RNA was isolated and subjected to mRNA differential display analysis, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technique useful in the identification of differentially expressed genes(17.Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4694) Google Scholar). The pattern of gene expression was substantially changed in DMK-expressing clones, and the new pattern of expression was essentially identical to that of differentiated BC3H1 cells. Two differentially expressed gene products, consistent with a skeletal muscle phenotype, were cloned by differential display, sequenced, and used as Northern blot probes. Skeletal muscle-specific β-tropomyosin mRNA expression was increased, and vimentin mRNA expression was decreased in DMK-expressing clones. Northern blot analysis of other genes implicated in myogenesis showed that myogenin mRNA was induced in both DMK-expressing and differentiated BC3H1 cells. Retinoblastoma tumor supressor (Rb) mRNA was present in untransfected cells but absent from DMK-expressing and differentiated cells. Creatine kinase activity assays demonstrated that DMK-expressing clones up-regulate expression of the M creatine kinase isoform. Thus, despite the presence of mitogens, overexpression of DMK in BC3H1 cells induces the skeletal muscle phenotype. A coding-only DMK cDNA construct was derived from a full-length (flDMK) cDNA (kindly supplied by R. G. Korneluk) by PCR (Perkin-Elmer) using primers that annealed to the first methionine and termination codons. Primers were designed such that EcoRI restriction sites would be added to the termini of the amplified product: forward primer (5′-GGCCGAATTCATGTCAGCCGAGGTGCGG-3′), reverse primer (5′-CCGGGAATTCTCAGGGAGCGCGGGCGGC-3′). A 1889-base pair PCR product was amplified and ligated into the EcoRI site of the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). This clone, designated pcDNA3/coDMK was sequenced (Sequenase 2.0, United States Biochemical Corp.) to verify integrity of the cDNA sequence. 3′-UTR sequences were subcloned from the full-length cDNA in a similar fashion. Forward primer (5′-GGCCGAATTCGCCGCCCGCGCTCCCTGA-3′), reverse primer (5′-CCGGGAATTCTTTTATTCGCGAGGGTCG-3′). A 724-base pair PCR product was amplified and ligated into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3; this construct was designated pcDNA3/DMK 3′-UTR. BC3H1 cells were grown in T75 flasks, in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc., 11965-050) containing 15% fetal bovine serum and 5% defined calf serum (HyClone), 10 mM Hepes (Life Technologies, Inc., 25030-0204), 4 mML-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc., 15630-015), and 0.5% chick embryo extract (Life Technologies, Inc., 16460-016). Cells were lifted and replated 24 h prior to transfection to increase transfection efficiency. Medium was aspirated, BC3H1 cells washed once with serum-free DMEM, and DNA mix added containing 10 μg of pcDNA3/flDMK, pcDNA3/coDMK, or pcDNA3/DMK 3′-UTR and 75 μl of Lipofectamine reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., 18324-012) in 3 ml of DMEM/T75 flask. Cells were incubated for 5 h at 37°C, DNA mix aspirated, washed once with serum-free DMEM, and incubated 24 h in 10 ml of complete medium with 2 × serum at 37°C. Following incubation, medium was aspirated, 10 ml of complete growth medium was added, and cells were grown at 37°C for 48-72 h. Stable transfectants were subsequently generated by clonal selection of G418-resistant foci. Differentiated BC3H1 cultures were produced by incubating untransfected cells in DMEM containing 0.5% fetal calf serum for 3-7 days. Cell lysates (20 μg) were resolved electrophoretically on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Hoefer Minigel). Gels were transferred to a 0.2-μm nylon membrane (Rad-Free, Schleicher & Schuell) using a semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad) in a glycine/Tris/methanol buffer at 10 V for 15 min. The membrane was blocked in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk for 2-10 h. The primary antibody (anti-DM kinase(10.Whiting E.L. Waring J.D.

Total RNA was isolated from BC3H1 cells using RNA STAT-60 (18.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63144) Google Scholar) (Tel-Test). RNA (15 μg/lane) was resolved by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis (2% agarose, 2% formaldehyde) and transferred to a nylon membrane (Nytran, Schleicher & Schuell) in a positive pressure transfer cell (Stratagene). Prehybridizations and hybridizations were performed in 10 ml of QuikHyb solution (Stratagene), 10 ml of formamide, and 200 μg of yeast tRNA (Sigma R-5636) at 42°C. DNA probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP using the Prime-It II random priming kit (Stratagene); unincorporated counts were removed by passing the probes through Sephadex G-50 Nick spin columns (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). After overnight hybridization, membranes were washed twice for 15 min at room temperature in 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS followed by one wash at 58°C for 30 min in 0.25 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. Autoradiography was performed by exposure of the membranes to Kodak X-Omat film for 12-48 h. Differential display was done exactly as described by Pardee and Liang (17.Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4694) Google Scholar) (RNAmap, GenHunter). DNA-free total RNA (0.2 μg) was reverse transcribed using oligo(dT) primers, followed by PCR with an arbitrary upstream primer in the presence of [35S]dATP. Two arbitrary upstream primers were used: AP-1, 5′-AGCCAGCGAA-3′; and AP-4, 5′-GGTACTCCAC-3′. Four downstream oligo-dT primers were used: T12MG, T12MA, T12MT, and T12MC. A variety of PCR products, representing the 3′ ends of numerous expressed cDNAs, were visualized by autoradiography on a standard denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Differentially expressed bands of interest were extracted from the gel and reamplified. The reamplified products were subcloned into the TA cloning vector pCR II (Invitrogen), and fully sequenced in both directions by dideoxy sequencing (Sequenase 2.0). Sequences of interest were compared to the GenBank(™) data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information, using the BLAST alignment algorithm (19.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70308) Google Scholar) Network Service. Cell lysates (1-4 μg) were resolved by agarose electrophoresis isoenzyme gels using the CARDIO-REP system (20.Puleo P.R. Clin. Chem. 1989; 35: 1452-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (Helena Laboratories). The first attempt to produce a stable DMK-overexpressing cell line was unsuccessful. Stably transfected clones were produced by transfecting BC3H1 cells with a plasmid construct containing the full-length DMK cDNA, including the 5′- and 3′-UTR. DMK mRNA and protein were undetectable in three independently generated full-length clones (Fig. 1, panel A, lanes 3-6, and panel B, lanes 10-13). One full-length clone, number 11, expressed very low levels of DMK mRNA but no protein expression could be detected. Given observations regarding the influence of UTR sequences upon gene expression(21.Mountford P.S. Brandon M.R. Adams T.E. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1992; 4: 656-658Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 22.Rastinejad F. Blau H.M. Cell. 1993; 72: 903-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 23.Jackson R.J.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1476-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and considering that the genetic lesion associated with DM is located in the 3′-UTR of DMK, we removed the UTR to produce a coding-only construct (coDMK). The coDMK construct was derived from the full-length cDNA by PCR using primers that annealed to the start and termination codon sequences. DMK coding sequences were cloned into the pcDNA3 eukaryotic expression vector. Stable transfectants were produced with the coDMK construct and three independently isolated clonal cell lines constitutively expressed high levels of DMK mRNA and protein (Fig. 1, panel A, lane 2, and panel B, lane 9). Additionally, six independent DMK 3′-UTR clones expressing high concentrations of DMK 3′-UTR mRNA were produced. Log phase BC3H1 cells growing in high mitogen (20% serum) conditions typically exhibit a fibroblast-like morphology. In low mitogen conditions (1% serum), cells withdraw from the cell cycle, begin expression of muscle-specific genes, and assume an elongated, myoblast-like appearance(26.Olson E.N. Caldwell K.L. Gordon J.I. Glaser L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2644-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The coDMK transfectants were phenotypically similar to differentiated BC3H1 myoblasts, appearing elongated with numerous cellular outgrowths. coDMK transfectants did not exhibit cell cycle arrest and maintained the “differentiated” morphology in high serum conditions. In contrast, clones expressing DMK 3′-UTR alone retained a fibroblast-like morphology identical to untransfected BC3H1 cells. In order to identify changes in gene expression associated with DMK or DMK 3′-UTR overexpression, we performed differential display analysis of the stable coDMK and 3′-UTR cell lines. The patterns of gene expression in the 3′-UTR clone and the untransfected control cells were nearly identical (Fig. 2, panels A-C, lanes 2,3, 5, 6, 8, and 9). In comparison, cells expressing DMK exhibited a markedly different pattern of mRNA expression (Fig. 2, panels A-C, lanes 1, 4, and 7). Expression of numerous mRNAs were affected, apparently representing both up- and down-regulation of several genes. We initially reamplified and subcloned nine differentially expressed cDNA products. The products were both sequenced and used to probe Northern blots to verify that differential display correlated with differential expression. Six of the products were unidentifiable, either showing no significant similarity to sequences in the GenBank(™) data base, or matching the 3′ end of a partially sequenced but uncharacterized cDNA. One product represented mitochondrial sequences and was not examined further. One product, designated DM114.10, hybridized to an mRNA unique to DMK-expressing cells (Fig. 2C and 3A, lanes 1-3). DM114.10 also hybridized to an mRNA expressed at high concentrations in differentiated BC3H1 cells (data not shown). This product was identified as a differentiation-dependent form of β-tropomyosin unique to skeletal muscle. Rodents have been shown to produce two different tissue-specific β-tropomyosin messages(27.Wang Y.-C. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2728-2736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fibroblasts and smooth muscle produce a 1.1-kilobase mRNA transcript; skeletal muscle transcripts are larger (1.2 kilobases) and possess a different 3′ end produced by alternative splicing and usage of a distal polyadenylation site. Our DM114.10 product is limited to those 3′ sequences unique to the skeletal muscle mRNA. The clone designated DM114.07 was identified as vimentin and recognized an mRNA present in untransfected BC3H1 cells that became diminished in DMK-expressing cells (Fig. 2B and 3B, lanes 4-6) as well as differentiated BC3H1 cells (data not shown). Studies in rodents and humans have established that vimentin expression is high in satellite cells and regenerating muscle, but undetectable in mature skeletal muscle(28.Bennett G.S. Fellini S.A. Toyama Y. Holtzer H. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 82: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 29.Gallanti A. Prelle A. Moggio M. Ciscato P. Checcarelli N. Sciacco M. Comini A. Scarlato G.

Histochem. J. 1994; 26: 916-928PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the differential expression of β-tropomyosin and vimentin, we began to suspect that cells expressing DMK were initiating a portion of a skeletal muscle differentiation program. Although the cognate messages could not be identified, the expression patterns of two of the differential display products, DM114.02 and DM114.03, were consistent with a skeletal muscle phenotype. DM114.02 recognized a transcript present in cells expressing DMK that was absent from untransfected cells (data not shown) and had high similarity to a human cDNA isolated from skeletal muscle (GenBank accession no. Z28822). DM114.03 hybridized to a transcript in untransfected cells that was absent in the DMK clone (data not shown) and shared similarity with a human cDNA from cardiac muscle (GenBank(™) accession no. Z33441). To further assess the differentiation state of DMK-expressing cells, we examined expression of two genes known to be implicated in myogenic development: myogenin (32.Edmondson D.G. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 755-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and retinoblastoma (Rb)(33.Gu W. Schneider J.W. Condorelli G. Kaushal S. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. 1993; 72: 309-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 34.Halevy O. Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1018-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). A myogenin cDNA probe detected high levels of myogenin mRNA induced in both DMK-expressing and differentiated cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Rb mRNA expression was affected in a reciprocal fashion; it was abundant in untransfected cells but decreased to undetectable levels in DMK-expressing and differentiated BC3H1 cells (Fig. 4, C and D). Creatine kinase (CK) isoforms serve as markers of skeletal muscle differentiation(35.Morris G.E. Cooke A. Cole R.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1972; 74: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 36.Turner D.C. Maier V. Eppenberger H.M. Dev. Biol. 1974; 37: 63-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 37.Perriard J.-C. Perriard E.R. Eppenberger H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6529-6535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Undifferentiated myogenic cells predominantly express the B isoform (Fig. 5, lane 1). Following myogenesis, M creatine kinase becomes the major isoform. We perfomed CK activity assays on DMK-expressing clones and observed that with respect to CK activity, DMK-expressing cells appeared to be equivalent to differentiated cells; M creatine kinase activity was strongly increased (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 3). Finally, we performed differential display on RNA from untransfected/undifferentiated, differentiated, and DMK-expressing cells. The patterns of mRNA expression shown by DMK-expressing and differentiated cells were nearly identical (Fig. 2D, lanes 11 and 12), and both were substantially different from the pattern of mRNA expression detected in untransfected/undifferentiated cells (Fig. 2D, lane 10). This observation suggests that many of the changes in gene expression associated with DMK overexpression are similar to those induced during differentiation in BC3H1 cells. We have not determined whether the apparent myogenic effect of DMK overexpression is a specific one, or if it is simply a result of the nonspecific activity of an ectopically expressed protein kinase. However, overexpression of protein kinase A or C, the two kinases that share the greatest homology with DMK, actually inhibit muscle-specific transcription(38.Li L. Heller-Harrison R. Czech M. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4478-4495Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 39.Li L. Zhou J. James G. Heller-Harrison R. Czech M.P. Olson E.N. Cell. 1992; 71: 1181-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Although no protein kinase has yet been conclusively implicated in the control of myogenesis, it is likely that kinase cascades are involved in the establishment and maintainance of the differentiated state in muscle(40.Castellani L. Reedy M.C. Gauzzi M.C. Provenzano C. Alema S. Falcone G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that DMK may influence muscle development through an effect upon myogenic gene products(41.Shaw D.J. McCurrach M. Rundle S.A. Harley H.G. Crow S.R. Sohn R. Thirion J.-P. Hamshere M.G. Buckler A.J. Harper P.S. Housman D.E. Brook J.D. Genomics. 1993; 18: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recent observations by Meixell et al.2 suggest that myogenin can serve as an in vitro substrate for DMK. Ultimately, however, any formal model will rely upon identification of the actual in vivo substrate. It is interesting to note that DMK-expressing cells maintain a differentiated phenotype while actively dividing in high mitogen conditions, suggesting that cell cycle arrest is not a prerequisite for differentiation in these clones. We thank Robert Korneluk for the gift of DMK antibody and Eric Olson for a myogenin cDNA construct. We also thank Frank Stewart for assistance in figure and manuscript preparation."

Biol. Chem. 268, 20547-20554). In order to identify Gi protein(s) coupled to PYY receptors, antisense Gαi protein RNAs were expressed in Cl.10 cells by transfecting the pcDNA3 vector into which were inserted 39 bases of the 5′-noncoding region of Gαi2 or Gαi3 used as specific antisense templates. A Cl.10/αi2- clone was selected which displayed a drastic decrease (>90%) of the expression of Gαi2 without changes of Gαi3, Gαs, and Gβ subunits (Gαi1 is not present in Cl.10 cells) as evidenced by Western blots. When compared to untransfected cells, this clone exhibited: (i) an increase in the dissociation constant of PYY receptors (5.3 versus 0.6 nM) identical to that observed in pertussis toxin-treated untransfected cells; (ii) an absence of inhibition of125I-PYY binding by guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS); and (iii) the failure of PYY to inhibit cAMP levels and to stimulate [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. A clone was also selected which exhibited a specific decrease (>80%) of Gαi3 as compared to untransfected cells. The sensitivity to GTPγS and the dissociation constant of PYY receptors as well as PYY-mediated inhibition of cAMP were identical to those observed in untransfected cells. These findings support an exclusive coupling of PYY receptors to Gαi2.

PYY receptor-mediated events are triggered through interaction of PYY receptors with pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi proteins in PKSV-PCT cells. Indeed, preincubation of cells with pertussis toxin completely reverses the PYY-induced inhibition of cAMP production and stimulation of cell growth and converts PYY receptors to a low affinity state(3.Voisin T. Bens M. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20547-20554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the fact that (i) multiple Gi proteins including Gi1, Gi2, and Gi3 can contribute to heptahelical receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (18.Taussig R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) and (ii) pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins have been shown to be crucial for the mitogenic action of several agents(19.Pouysségur J. Seuwen K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), the characterization of the pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi protein(s) coupled to PYY receptors is an important step leading to further understanding of the mechanism of action of this recently discovered receptor. In the present work, we have developed the stable expression of antisense Gαi RNA in a clone PKSV-PCT Cl.10 (referred to as Cl.10 below) isolated from the parent PKSV-PCT cells in order to identify Gi proteins coupled to PYY receptors. By studying receptor affinity and regulation of ligand binding by GTPγS, inhibition of cAMP production and stimulation of cell growth in Cl.10 cell clones in which endogenous Gαi proteins were permanently down-regulated after transfection with antisense Gαi expression vectors, we provide evidence for the exclusive coupling of the PYY receptor to the Gi2 protein. Synthetic porcine PYY, porcine NPY, rat PP, and Tyr0-PTH(1-34) were purchased from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA).125I-Na (IMS300) and [methyl-3H]thymidine were from Amersham Corp. (Les Ulis, France). Geneticin (G418) and culture media DMEM and Ham's F-12 were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Cergy Pontoise, France). Transferrin, sodium selenate, dexamethasone, triiodothyronine, insulin, glutamine, forskolin, epidermal growth factor, HEPES, PMSF, TLCK, bacitracin, pertussis toxin, and the other highly purified chemicals used were purchased from Sigma. BSA (Pentex, fraction V) was obtained from Miles Laboratories (Elkart, NJ). Anti-αi2/αi1 (AS7), anti-αi3/αO (EC2), anti-αs (A572), and anti-β (U49) antibodies were from DuPont NEN.125I-Tyr36-monoiodo PYY (referred to as125I-PYY below) was prepared and purified as described elsewhere(3.Voisin T. Bens M. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20547-20554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PKSV-PCT cell line was derived from microdissected proximal convoluted tubules from the kidney of a transgenic mouse (L-PK/Tag1) carrying the large T and small t antigens of SV40 placed under the control of the rat L-type pyruvate kinase promoter gene(16.Cartier N. Lacave R. Vallet V. Hagege J. Hellio R. Robine S. Pringault E. Cluzeaud F. Briand P. Kahn A. Vandewalle A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 695-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Lacave R. Bens M. Cartier N. Vallet V. Robine S. Pringault E. Kahn A. Vandewalle A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 705-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKSV-PCT cells were cloned by limiting dilution. Briefly, a monodispersed cell suspension was distributed to microtest plates at a mean ratio of 0.25 cell/well. Those wells containing only one cell, as ascertained by microscopic inspection by two independent observers, were identified with their coordinates on the plates. Cells grown in wells observed to initially contain one cell were subsequently transferred to increasingly larger culture vessels. Among the 12 clones obtained, the clone Cl.10 was selected on the basis of its high binding capacity for PYY. Cl.10 cells were cultured in a standard culture medium (DMEM:Ham's F-12, 1:1 (v/v); 60 nM sodium selenate; 5 μg/ml transferrin; 2 mM glutamine; 50 nM dexamethasone; 1 nM triiodothyronine; 10 nM epidermal growth factor; 2% fetal calf serum; 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4), supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin and 20 mMD-glucose at 37°C in 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere as previously described(3.Voisin T.

Vandewalle A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 705-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As previously shown for the parent cell line PKSV-PCT(3.Voisin T. Bens M. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20547-20554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Cartier N. Lacave R. Vallet V. Hagege J. Hellio R. Robine S. Pringault E. Cluzeaud F. Briand P. Kahn A. Vandewalle A. J.

Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 705-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), such culture conditions with D-glucose-enriched medium favors the activation of Tag transcripts and cell growth. All studies on the Cl.10 cell line were performed between the 4th and 12th passages on sets of cells seeded on plastic culture flasks (25- or 75-cm2 surface). The cells were routinely passaged every 7 days. The pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) was used to construct antisense Gαi subunit expression vectors. It contains enhancer/promoter sequences of the human cytomegalovirus intermediate early gene and a polyadenylation signal from the bovine growth hormone gene, an ampicillin resistance gene and a Col E1 origin of replication for selection and maintenance in Escherichia coli, a neomycin-resistant gene expressed from the SV40 early promoter for selection of stable transformants in the presence of G418, and T7 and Sp6 promoters flanking the multiple cloning site. The 39 bases of the 5′-noncoding region, immediately upstream of end including the ATG translation initiation codon of Gαi2 (5′-GCGTGTGGGGGCCAGGCCGGGCCGGCGGACGGCAGGATG-3′) and Gαi3 (5′-GCGAGCCAGGGCCCGGTCCCCTCTCCGGCCGCCGTCATG-3′) were selected for use as antisense probes (20.Watkins D.C. Johnson G.L. Malbon C.C. Science. 1992; 258: 1373-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21.Moxham C.M. Hod Y. Malbon C.C. Science. 1993; 260: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) to take advantage of the diversity of the nucleotide sequence in this region and to provide specificity (48% identity in noncoding region versus >85% identity in coding region). Oligodeoxynucleotides of this sequence and the complementary strand were synthesized commercially (Eurogentec, Eraing, Belgium). The construction of vectors outlined below was performed with the use of standard techniques. Complementary oligodeoxynucleotides were hybridized together, and the double-stranded DNA was inserted into the EcoRV cloning site of the polylinker of pcDNA3. After transformation into competent E. coli XL-1, ampicillin-resistant clones were selected for the presence of inserts by restriction mapping and analyzed for the orientation of the inserts by DNA sequencing. Cl.10 cells were transfected by electroporation using a gene pulser (Electroporator II, Invitrogen). 5 × 106 exponentially growing cells were preincubated on ice for 5 min with 20 μg of pcDNA3 plasmid encoding Gαi2 or Gαi3 antisenses or without a cDNA insert and 20 μg of salmon sperm DNA carrier in cold DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium with 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Electroporation was performed at 330 V and 500 μF. After electroporation, cells were kept on ice for 5 min, added to 5 ml of culture medium, and transferred in a 25-cm2 plastic culture flask. 48 h after electroporation, transfected Cl.10 cells were selected by addition of geneticin to a final concentration of 400 μg/ml for 3 weeks. Cl.10 cells which were resistant to geneticin were subsequently cloned by limiting dilution as described above and characterized for their Gαi2 content by Western blotting (see below). Control and transfected Cl.10 cells were grown in 75-cm2 plastic culture flasks for 6-13 days (see legends to figures) as described above. Cells were washed three times with 0.13 M PBS (pH 7.4), harvested using a rubber policeman, and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The cell pellet was then exposed for 30 min to hypoosmotic 5 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) as described elsewhere (3.Voisin T. Bens M. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20547-20554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thereafter, aliquots of cell suspensions were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min, washed with 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), pelleted, and stored at −80°C until used. This particulate fraction from cell homogenates will be referred to as a membrane preparation. In some experiments, confluent cells grown in 25-cm2 plastic culture flasks were treated overnight with pertussis toxin (0.4 μg/ml). A membrane fraction was then prepared as described above and used immediately for binding experiments. This procedure was also applied to confluent cells grown in 12-well trays before cellular cAMP assay. Binding of125I-PYY to membrane preparations was conducted as described previously(3.Voisin T. Bens M. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20547-20554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Voisin T. Rouyer-Fessard C. Laburthe M. Am. J.

Briefly, membranes (200 μg of protein/ml) were incubated for 90 min at 30°C in 250 μl of incubation buffer (20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), 2% (w/v) BSA, 17 mg/liter PMSF, 10 mg/liter TLCK, 10 mg/liter pepstatin, 10 mg/liter leupeptin, and 100 mg/liter bacitracin) containing 0.05 nM125I-PYY (2,200 Ci/mmol) with or without unlabeled PYY or other competing peptides. At the end of the incubation, 150-μl aliquots of membranes were mixed with 150 μl of ice-cold incubation buffer. Bound and free peptides were separated by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min, and membrane pellets were washed twice with 10% (w/v) sucrose in 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4). The radioactivity was then counted with a γ counter. The nonspecific binding represented about 20% of total binding. All binding data were analyzed using the LIGAND computer program developed by Munson and Rodbard(22.Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 197: 220-239Crossref Scopus (7759) Google Scholar). 125I-Tyr0-PTH(1-34) (1,300 Ci/mmol) was prepared by the chloramine T method and purified on a column of Sephadex G-50. Membranes (200 μg of protein/ml) were incubated for 60 min at 30°C with 0.03 nM tracer as described above for PYY, and bound and free peptides were separated by centrifugation (see above). Cellular cAMP content was assayed as previously described(3.Voisin T. Bens M. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20547-20554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells in 12-well trays were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 μM forskolin in 1 ml of DMEM/Ham's F-12 containing 2% (w/v) BSA, 0.1% (w/v) bacitracin, and 0.2 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine without or with 0.1 μM PYY for 40 min at 37°C. At the end of the incubation, the medium was rapidly removed, cells were washed in 1 ml of PBS (pH 7.4), and 1 ml of 1 M perchloric acid was added. After centrifugation for 10 min at 4,000 × g, the cAMP present in the supernatant was succinylated, and its concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay as described elsewhere(8.Voisin T. Rouyer-Fessard C. Laburthe M. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 255: G113-G120Google Scholar). Data are reported as picomoles of cAMP per mg of protein. Cell protein determinations were made in parallel wells. Membranes (50 μg of protein) were solubilized as previously described(23.Couvineau A. Darmoul D. Blais A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Daviaud D. Voisin T. Paris H. Rouot B. Laburthe M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1478-C1484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Then, samples were alkylated prior to electrophoresis in order to enhance the clarity and hence resolution of polypeptide bands(3.Voisin T. Bens M. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20547-20554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were heated at 100°C for 5 min, and proteins were separated in a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose as described elsewhere(23.Couvineau A. Darmoul D. Blais A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Daviaud D. Voisin T. Paris H. Rouot B. Laburthe M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1478-C1484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose sheets were incubated with anti-αs (A572, dilution 1/500), anti-αi2/αi1 (AS7, dilution 1/1,000), anti-αi3/αO (EC2, dilution 1/1,000) or anti-β (U49, 1/5,000) followed by washing and incubation with125I-labeled goat antibodies to rabbit IgG in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, and 0.02% NaN3 for 2 h. After extensive washing, nitrocellulose sheets were dried prior to autoradiography(23.Couvineau A. Darmoul D. Blais A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Daviaud D. Voisin T. Paris H. Rouot B. Laburthe M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1478-C1484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gels were calibrated with molecular weight marker proteins: myosin (200,000), phosphorylase b (97,000), BSA (68,000), ovalbumin (43,000), and carbonic anhydrase (29,000). Autoradiograms of the dried immunoblots were scanned with a Macintosh Onescanner densitometer in order to estimate the relative amount of G protein subunits. Cell growth kinetics were estimated by [methyl-3H]thymidine (25 Ci/mmol) incorporation. Cells, detached with 2.7 mM EDTA, were seeded (15,000 cells/dish) in 12-well trays and grown for 3 days in standard culture medium (see above). Cells were then incubated in the absence or presence of 0.1 μM PYY for 24 h in a serum- and growth factor-free culture medium. Cells were then incubated for 6 h with [methyl-3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi/well) and rinsed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS. 1 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid was added for 30 min at 4°C. The trichloroacetic acid was removed and discarded after which the cells were further incubated for 30 min at 37°C with 1 ml of 0.3 N NaOH. After neutralization with acetic acid, the radioactivity in the cell extracts was measured by scintillation counting, and the results were expressed as counts/min/106 cells. Cells were counted before addition of trichloroacetic acid. Cells grown on 12-mm glass coverslips were preincubated in 80 mM PIPES buffer (pH 6.8), containing 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA, and 0.075% saponin, for 5 min and then fixed at room temperature with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, washed with PBS, quenched in 50 mM NH4Cl in PBS, and then blocked and permeabilized in 0.075% saponin in PBS for 20 min. The coverslips were then incubated with anti-αi2 (AS7 diluted 1/50) or anti-αi3 (EC2 diluted 1/50) for 45 min. Antibodies were diluted in gelatin-saponin-PBS. After washing, the coverslips were incubated for 45 min with a fluorescein isothiocyanate goat anti-rabbit antibody (diluted 1/500). The coverslips were mounted in Glycergel, and selected fields were scanned using a True Confocal Scanner Leica TCS 4D comprising a Leica Diaplan inverted microscope equipped with an argon-krypton ion laser (488 nm) with an output power of 2-50 mW and a VME bus MC 68020/68881 computer system coupled to an optical disk for image storage (Leica Lasertchnik GmbH). The emitted light was collected through a long-pass filter on the target of the photo multiplier. Each sample was treated with a kalman filter to increase the ratio signal versus background. All image-generating and processing operations were carried out using the Leica CLSM software package. Screen images were taken on Kodak Ektachrome using a 35-mm camera. Cells were plated (500,000 cells/filter) on nitrocellulose filters (Millipore HAHY; porosity, 0.45 μm; diameter, 1.2 cm). Seven days later the transepithelial resistance was measured using a Millicell electrical resistance system (ERS, Millipore Corporation) as described elsewhere(16.Cartier N. Lacave R. Vallet V. Hagege J. Hellio R. Robine S. Pringault E. Cluzeaud F. Briand P. Kahn A. Vandewalle A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 695-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and thereafter the filters were fixed in Bouin's fluid and embedded in paraffin. Cross sections (4 μm) were stained with hematein eosin and observed by light microscopy. Proteins were measured using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) based on the method of Bradford (24.Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (210247) Google Scholar) with BSA as a standard. The activities of aminopeptidase N and dipeptidyl peptidase IV were determined as described elsewhere(25.Nagatsu T. Hino M. Fuyamada H. Yahakawa T. Sakakibara S. Nakagawa Y. Takemoto T. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 466-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as means ± S.E. from (n) separate experiments. Statistical significance between groups was calculated by the Student's t test. Among the 12 clones obtained by limiting dilution from the parent PKSV-PCT cell line, four exhibited the ability to bind125I-PYY specifically. The highest binding was observed with clone 10, and the properties of PYY receptors in this clone were further investigated. Cl.10 cells express a typical PYY receptor as described in the parent PKSV-PCT cell line (3.Voisin T. Bens M. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20547-20554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and rat intestinal epithelial crypt cells(8.Voisin T. Rouyer-Fessard C. Laburthe M. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 255: G113-G120Google Scholar). PYY receptors in Cl.10 cells discriminate between PYY and the naturally occurring related peptides NPY and PP. The peptide concentrations that induced half-maximal inhibition of125I-PYY binding (IC50) were as follows (Fig. 1A): PYY (IC50 = 0.6 ± 0.1 nM) < NPY (IC50 = 6.3 ± 0.6 nM) « PP (IC50 > 1 μM). Scatchard analysis of binding data indicated the presence of one class of binding site with a dissociation constant of 0.63 ± 0.20 nM and a binding capacity of 145 ± 22 fmol/mg protein (three experiments). As shown in Fig. 1B, PYY, in the concentration range between 10-11 and 10-6M, inhibited forskolin-induced cAMP production in cultured Cl.10 cells. A 70% inhibition was observed at high PYY concentration (1 μM) and half-maximal inhibition was obtained for 5.2 ± 0.5 nM PYY. The inhibitory effect of PYY on cAMP production was completely abolished when cultured Cl.10 cells were preincubated with pertussis toxin (Fig. 1B), indicating a pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi protein-mediated event. Further experiments were conducted to determine the G protein profile in Cl.10 cells. Among the putative G protein subunits involved in the coupling of PYY receptors to biological events in Cl.10 cells, Western blot analysis indicated the presence of the Mr"

The importance of phenylalanine residues Phe-116, Phe-119, Phe-120, Phe-126, Phe-144, Phe-159, and Phe-163 was explored by alanine replacement mutagenesis. It was found that substitutions at all positions, except Phe-120 and Phe-144, produced viable enzymes, although a range of cellular growth phenotypes were observed like hygromycin B resistance and low pH sensitivity, which are linked to in vivo action of the H+-ATPase. Lethal positions Phe-120 and Phe-144, could be replaced with tryptophan to produce viable enzyme, although the F144W mutant was highly perturbed. ATP hydrolysis measurements showed that Km was not significantly altered for most mutant enzymes, whereas Vmax was moderately reduced with two mutants, F144W and F163A, showing less than 50% of the normal activity. Double Phe → Ala mutations in TM1 and TM2 were constructed to examine whether such substitutions would result in a higher degree of enzyme destabilization. Mutant F116A/F119A was viable and gave a normal phenotype, while F159A/F163A was not viable. Other double mutants, F116A/F159A and F119AF/159A, which are predicted to lie juxtaposed on TM1 and TM2, produced non-functional enzymes. However, a viable F119V/F159A mutant was isolated and showed hygromycin B resistance. These results suggest that double mutations eliminating 2 phenylalanine residues strongly destabilize the enzyme. A putative proline kink at Gly-122/Pro-123 in TM1 is not essential for enzyme action since these residues could be variously substituted (G122A or G122N; P123A, P123G, or P123F) producing viable enzymes with moderate effects on in vitro ATP hydrolysis or proton transport. However, several substitutions produced prominent growth phenotypes, suggesting that local perturbations were occurring. The location of Pro-123 is important because Gly-122 and Pro-123 could not be exchanged. In addition, a double Pro-Pro created by a G122P mutation was lethal, suggesting that maintenance of an α-helical structure is important. Other mutations in the hairpin, including modification of a buried charged residue, E129A, were not critical for enzyme action. These data are consistent with the view that the helical hairpin comprising TM1 and TM2 has important structural determinants that contribute to its overall stability and flexibility.
