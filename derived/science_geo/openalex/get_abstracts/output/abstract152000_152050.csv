https://openalex.org/W2024771919,"This review puts into perspective the present state and prospects for controlling quantum phenomena in atoms and molecules. The topics considered include the nature of physical and chemical control objectives, the development of possible quantum control rules of thumb, the theoretical design of controls and their laboratory realization, quantum learning and feedback control in the laboratory, bulk media influences, and the ability to utilize coherent quantum manipulation as a means for extracting microscopic information. The preview of the field presented here suggests that important advances in the control of molecules and the capability of learning about molecular interactions may be reached through the application of emerging theoretical concepts and laboratory technologies."
https://openalex.org/W2076349504,"In a California riparian system, the most diverse natural assemblages are the most invaded by exotic plants. A direct in situ manipulation of local diversity and a seed addition experiment showed that these patterns emerge despite the intrinsic negative effects of diversity on invasions. The results suggest that species loss at small scales may reduce invasion resistance. At community-wide scales, the overwhelming effects of ecological factors spatially covarying with diversity, such as propagule supply, make the most diverse communities most likely to be invaded."
https://openalex.org/W2059232881,"The ""tragedy of the commons,"" that is, the selfish exploitation of resources in the public domain, is a reason for many of our everyday social conflicts. However, humans are often more helpful to others than evolutionary theory would predict, unless indirect reciprocity takes place and is based on image scoring (which reflects the way an individual is viewed by a group), as recently shown by game theorists. We tested this idea under conditions that control for confounding factors. Donations were more frequent to receivers who had been generous to others in earlier interactions. This shows that image scoring promotes cooperative behavior in situations where direct reciprocity is unlikely."

Microwaves penetrate clouds with little attenuation, giving an uninterrupted view of the ocean surface. This is a distinct advantage over infrared measurements of SST, which are obstructed by clouds. Comparisons with ocean buoys show a root mean square difference of about 0.6°C, which is partly due to the satellite-buoy spatial-temporal sampling mismatch and the difference between the ocean skin temperature and bulk temperature. Microwave SST retrievals provide insights in a number of areas, including tropical instability waves, marine boundary layer dynamics, and the prediction of hurricane intensity."
https://openalex.org/W2070209782,"Fish faunas across the continental United States have become more similar through time because of widespread introductions of a group of cosmopolitan species intended to enhance food and sport fisheries. On average, pairs of states have 15.4 more species in common now than before European settlement of North America. The 89 pairs of states that formerly had no species in common now share an average of 25.2 species. Introductions have played a larger role than extirpations in homogenizing fish faunas. Western and New England states have received the most introductions, which is a reflection of the small number of native fishes in these areas considered desirable gamefish by settlers."
https://openalex.org/W2069812226,"Light signals perceived by the phytochrome family of sensory photoreceptors are transduced to photoresponsive genes by an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor PIF3 binds specifically to a G-box DNA-sequence motif present in various light-regulated gene promoters, and that phytochrome B binds reversibly to G-box–bound PIF3 specifically upon light-triggered conversion of the photoreceptor to its biologically active conformer. We suggest that the phytochromes may function as integral light-switchable components of transcriptional regulator complexes, permitting continuous and immediate sensing of changes in this environmental signal directly at target gene promoters."
https://openalex.org/W1993655526,"A uranium-lead zircon age for a volcanic ash interstratified with fossil-bearing, shallow marine siliciclastic rocks in the Zimnie Gory section of the White Sea region indicates that a diverse assemblage of body and trace fossils occurred before 555.3 +/- 0.3 million years ago. This age is a minimum for the oldest well-documented triploblastic bilaterian Kimberella. It also makes co-occurring trace fossils the oldest that are reliably dated. This determination of age implies that there is no simple relation between Ediacaran diversity and the carbon isotopic composition of Neoproterozoic seawater."
https://openalex.org/W1978791657,"The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) and associated release of cytochrome c are thought to be important in the apoptotic process. Nitric oxide (NO⋅) has been reported to inhibit apoptosis by acting on a variety of extra-mitochondrial targets. The relationship between cytochromec release and PTP opening, and the effects of NO⋅are not clearly established. Nitric oxide, S-nitrosothiols and peroxynitrite are reported to variously inhibit or promote PTP opening. In this study the effects of NO⋅ on the PTP were characterized by exposing isolated rat liver mitochondria to physiological and pathological rates of NO⋅ released from NONOate NO⋅donors. Nitric oxide reversibly inhibited PTP opening with an IC50 of 11 nm NO⋅/s, which can be readily achieved in vivo by NO⋅ synthases. The mechanism involved mitochondrial membrane depolarization and inhibition of Ca2+ accumulation. At supraphysiological release rates (>2 μm/s) NO⋅ accelerated PTP opening. Substantial cytochrome c release occurred with only a 20% change in mitochondrial swelling, was an early event in the PTP, and was also inhibited by NO⋅. Furthermore, NO⋅ exposure resulted in significantly lower cytochrome c release for the same degree of PTP opening. It is proposed that this pathway represents an additional mechanism underlying the antiapoptotic effects of NO⋅.

However, exposure of cells to high NO⋅ concentrations (>1 μm) results in extensive inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthesis (13.Cleeter M.W.J. Cooper J.M. Darley-Usmar V.M. Moncada S.

Under some conditions, such as inflammation or neurodegenerative diseases, NO⋅-dependent apoptosis has been observed (18.Bosca L. Hortelano S. Cell.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16487-16490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In this case, the hypothesis that NO⋅ reacts with superoxide to form peroxynitrite (25.Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6647) Google Scholar) has been suggested as a mechanism leading to apoptotic cell death (22.Estevez A.G. Radi R. Barbeito L. Shin J.T. Thompson J.A. Beckman J.S. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1543-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 23.Salgo M.G. Bermudez E. Squadrito G.L. Pryor W.A. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16487-16490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). It is clear from these observations that a number of molecular mechanisms underlie the effects of NO⋅ on apoptosis. A site for NO⋅ modulation of the apoptotic process that has received little attention is the controlled release of cytochromec from mitochondria. This is important, since it is becoming increasingly apparent that mitochondria are important mediators of apoptosis (26.Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4405) Google Scholar, 27.Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Marchetti P. Hirsch T. Gomez-Monterrey I. Castedo M. Kroemer G. J. Exp.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 53-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 29.Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar), and is possibly related to recent evidence for a mitochondrial NO⋅ synthase that would produce NO⋅ within the organelle (30.Tatoyan A Guilivi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11044-11-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 31.Ghafourifar P. Richter C. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1025-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor from mitochondria leads to activation of caspases 9 and 3 (29.Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar), and it was recently reported that caspase 3 can activate caspase 8, which can in turn trigger cytochrome crelease (32.Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17484-17490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). These findings suggest an amplification role for mitochondria in apoptotic signaling and support the concept that the control of cytochrome c release from the mitochondrion is likely to impact the progression of apoptosis. Mitochondrial cytochrome c release is regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins (33.Tsujimoto Y. Shimizu S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), which are targeted at the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP). This multisubunit protein complex includes the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel, the adenine nucleotide translocase, and cyclophilin D (33.Tsujimoto Y. Shimizu S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 34.Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar). Consistent with the molecular composition of the PTP, mitochondrial cytochrome c release is triggered by PTP inducers (Ca2+, phosphate, oxidants) and inhibited by PTP inhibitors (cyclosporin A, bongkrekic acid, EGTA). Recently, it was demonstrated that reconstituted PTP components (voltage-dependent anion channel, adenine nucleotide translocase, cyclophilin D) can regulate cytochrome c release from liposomes (35.Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar). The reported effects of NO⋅ on the mitochondrial PTP appear to be inconsistent. In some studies, mitochondria were exposed toS-nitrosothiols or high concentrations of NO⋅(0.6–10 μm), and PTP opening was observed (36.Balakirev M.Y. Khramtsov V.V. Zimmer G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 37.Borutaite V. Morkuniene R. Brown G.C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these effects were not mediated by NO⋅but by other reactive nitrogen species such as peroxynitrite (22.Estevez A.G. Radi R. Barbeito L. Shin J.T. Thompson J.A. Beckman J.S. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1543-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 23.Salgo M.G. Bermudez E. Squadrito G.L. Pryor W.A. Arch. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) or by S-nitrosation of mitochondrial proteins (37.Borutaite V. Morkuniene R. Brown G.C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast, it was also suggested that NO⋅ may inhibit PTP in a subpopulation of mitochondria, but the effects on cytochromec release were not reported (36.Balakirev M.Y. Khramtsov V.V. Zimmer G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Two major sites of interaction of NO⋅ with mitochondria in the submicromolar concentration range have been identified at complex III and the oxygen binding site of cytochrome c oxidase (13.Cleeter M.W.J. Cooper J.M. Darley-Usmar V.M. Moncada S. Schapira A.H.V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar, 39.Poderoso J.J. Lisdero C. Schopfer F. Riobo N. Carreras M.C. Cadenas E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37709-37716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Through inhibition of electron transport at these sites and a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, it has been observed that NO⋅stimulates mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux (40.Schweizer M. Richter C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In addition, inhibition of the putative mitochondrial NOS facilitates Ca2+ accumulation, consistent with either NO⋅-dependent prevention of Ca2+ uptake or enhanced release (31.Ghafourifar P. Richter C. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1025-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These observations are significant in the context of control of cytochrome c release, since the PTP is initiated by an increase in the intramitochondrial Ca2+concentration, and predict that NO⋅ should inhibit PTP opening (34.Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar). From the current literature, it is evident that the effects of NO⋅ per se, and of varying NO⋅ concentrations at the level of the isolated mitochondrion, on PTP and cytochromec release are uncertain. It was hypothesized that low rates of NO⋅ formation could inhibit Ca2+ accumulation and thus inhibit subsequent PTP opening and cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria. This hypothesis was tested by exposing isolated rat liver mitochondria to NO⋅ released from NONOate compounds at rates encompassing both the physiological and pathological ranges, and the effects on PTP opening and cytochrome crelease were determined. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats, 250–300 g in weight, were handled in accordance with recommendations in Ref. 48.National Institutes of HealthThe Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, DHEW Publication NIH85–23. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1996Google Scholar. Food and water were available ad libitum. All biochemicals were from Sigma except cyclosporin A and NONOate compounds (Alexis, San Diego CA), antibodies (Pharmingen, San Diego CA), and chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Stock solutions of NONOates were prepared in 10 mm NaOH and stored frozen. Their degradation, assayed spectrophotometrically at 251 nm, was not significant over the course of 1 week. Liver mitochondria were isolated according to standard procedures (41.Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Darley-Usmar V.M. Darley Usmar V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 3-5Google Scholar) in buffer containing sucrose (250 mm), Tris (10 mm), and EGTA (2 mm), pH 7.4, at 4 °C. The final centrifugation step and resuspension were performed in EGTA-free medium. Protein was determined using the Folin-phenol reagent (42.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) against a standard curve constructed using bovine serum albumin. Mitochondrial PTP opening was assayed essentially as described by Packer and Murphy (38.Packer M.A. Murphy M.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Opening of the PTP causes mitochondrial swelling that is conveniently assayed as a decrease in the light scattering (and thus absorbance) of a mitochondrial suspension. Absorbance at 540 nm was measured using a Gilford ResponseTM spectrophotometer with a 37 °C thermostatic chamber. Mitochondria (1 mg of protein) were suspended in polystyrene cuvettes in 1 ml of buffer containing HEPES (40 mm), mannitol (195 mm), sucrose (25 mm), succinate (5 mm), and rotenone (1 μm), pH 7.2. After a 2-min equilibration period, CaCl2 (60 μm) was added, and absorbance was monitored for 20 min. NO⋅ donors (1–5 μl of stock) were added 20 s before mitochondria unless otherwise indicated. The addition of NO⋅donors in NaOH did not significantly alter the pH of the buffer, and 5 μl NaOH alone had no effect on swelling (result not shown). Half-lives of NONOate compounds in the buffer system used in these experiments were as follows: DEA NONOate, 4.29 min; spermine NONOate, 202 min; DETA NONOate, 1600 min. These values differ from those published by the manufacturer and highlight the importance of determining decomposition characteristics of these compounds in each experimental system studied. Rates of NO⋅ release were determined by calculation from half-lives and polarographically using an NO⋅ electrode (WPI, Sarasota, FL), both methods yielding indistinguishable results. In the open cuvette system employed in these studies, a linear relationship was observed between the rate of NO⋅ release and the steady state concentration achieved, such that 15 nm NO⋅/s equated to a steady state concentration of 1 μm. Beyond 100 nmNO⋅/s, this relationship became nonlinear. At various time points during swelling experiments, cyclosporin A (5 μm) and EGTA (1 mm) were added to mitochondrial suspensions to prevent further swelling, and 900-μl aliquots were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatants were snap-frozen (liquid N2) and later analyzed by Western blotting. Samples were run on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (43.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes (44.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4534Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c was detected using a mouse anti-cytochrome c IgG (Pharmingen), followed by a horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody and ECL detection (both from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Supernatant samples were also analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in the mass spectrometry core facility at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, following a 10-fold concentration step using CentriconTM filtration devices (Millipore Corp., Bedford MA; 3000 molecular weight cut-off). The mass spectrometer was calibrated using apomyoglobin. Cytochromec was not detectable by spectrophotometric methods (reduced/oxidized A 550) in these supernatants but was detectable in samples only centrifuged for 3 min, highlighting the importance of complete centrifugation in such experiments to avoid artifacts from nonpelleted mitochondria. Mitochondria were incubated as for swelling experiments but at a lower protein concentration (0.25 mg/ml) and in the presence of the non-membrane-permeant Ca2+-sensitive dye Arsenazo III (100 μm), which measures extramitochondrial Ca2+(38.Packer M.A. Murphy M.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The difference in absorbance between 675 and 685 nm was measured using a Beckman DU700 diode array spectrophotometer. Optionally present were spermine NONOate (2.2 mm) or ruthenium red (10 μm). Readings were taken every 1 s, and data were smoothed using a 4-s moving integration window. Mitochondria were incubated in the same buffer used for swelling experiments, in an open chamber fitted with an electrode sensitive to the lipophilic cation triphenylmethylphosphonium (TPMP+) (45.Brand M.D. Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. Bioenergetics: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1995: 39-62Google Scholar). Nigericin was present at 100 nm. Four TPMP+ additions (final concentration 4 μm) were made to calibrate the electrode, followed by succinate (5 mm) to energize mitochondria and then FCCP to uncouple and correct for electrode drift. Membrane potential was calculated from the accumulation ratio of TPMP+ using the Nernst equation and a previously determined TPMP+ binding correction (45.Brand M.D. Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. Bioenergetics: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1995: 39-62Google Scholar). Readings were taken every 1 s, and data were smoothed using a 4-s moving integration window. Fig. 1 A shows the effects of a variety of NO⋅ donors on the Ca2+-induced swelling of rat liver mitochondria. Swelling was inhibited by NO⋅ and also by cyclosporin A and was completely abolished by omission of Ca2+ from the incubation, indicating that the phenomenon being observed was indeed PTP opening. Fig. 1 Bshows a dose response of the PTP to the effects of NO⋅ released from the 3 NONOates. The maximal inhibition of PTP by NO⋅ was comparable with or greater than that achievable by cyclosporin A (Fig.1 A). The NO⋅ release rate that gave 50% inhibition of PTP was ∼11 nm NO⋅/s, equating to a steady state concentration of ∼0.7 μm. Data from all three NO⋅ donors when normalized for NO⋅ release rate were indistinguishable, indicating that the effects were specific to NO⋅ and not due to the parent compounds. Fig. 2 A shows the effects of the NO⋅ donor spermine NONOate on mitochondrial Ca2+uptake measured by the Arsenazo III method (38.Packer M.A. Murphy M.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The addition of CaCl2 to the incubation caused a rapid increase in the Ca2+ signal that progressively decreased as the Ca2+ was taken up by the mitochondria and was reversed by the uncoupler FCCP. This phenomenon was ruthenium red-sensitive, indicating Ca2+ entry to the mitochondrial matrix via the Ca2+ uniporter. The presence of spermine NONOate at a concentration that inhibits PTP opening also completely prevented Ca2+ uptake. In a second series of experiments, the effects of NO⋅ on Δψ were determined using TPMP+ (45.Brand M.D. Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. Bioenergetics: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1995: 39-62Google Scholar). Development of Δψ results in accumulation of TPMP+ by mitochondria and a decreased signal from the TPMP+electrode. Consistent with the literature (40.Schweizer M. Richter C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), Fig. 2 Bshows that the presence of NO⋅ prevented development of Δψ upon the addition of succinate as substrate. These data support the hypothesis that NO⋅ inhibits the PTP by preventing membrane potential-driven Ca2+ accumulation. To establish that inhibition of PTP opening required the continuous generation of NO⋅, the effects of oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb) were examined. Fig. 3 A shows that the addition of oxyHb to mitochondria incubated with Ca2+plus NO⋅ results in a complete and immediate reversal of the NO⋅-dependent inhibition of PTP opening. Oxyhemoglobin alone had no effect on the PTP. In a further series of experiments, the ability of NO⋅ to inhibit PTP triggered by oxidants was examined. Fig. 3 B shows that the well characterized induction of the PTP by Ca2+ plustert-butyl hydroperoxide can also be inhibited by NO⋅. Similar results were obtained when Ca2+ plus phosphate was used to induce PTP (not shown). Fig. 4 (A and B) shows the results of a Western blot for cytochrome c in supernatants from PTP experiments. Calcium-treated mitochondria (lane 1) released cytochrome c, and NO⋅ inhibited this by 80% (lane 2). Untreated mitochondria (lane 3) did not release cytochrome c; nor did those treated with Ca2+plus cyclosporin-A (not shown). To examine the release of proteins from mitochondria that cannot be detected by Western blotting, concentrated supernatants were also analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Fig.4 C shows typical mass spectra from the same postmitochondrial supernatants as in Fig. 4 A. In agreement with the Western blot data, these spectra indicate that NO⋅inhibited cytochrome c release (12.1-kDa peak). The release of other proteins upon PTP opening (e.g. the peak at 10.8 kDa) was also inhibited by NO⋅. The amount of protein released from untreated mitochondria was very low, indicating minimal nonspecific leakage of proteins during the time course of these experiments. In a cell system, complete inhibition of the PTP in all mitochondria within a cell could only occur if high concentrations of NO⋅were present. However, this could also result in inhibition of ATP synthesis and would ultimately be cytotoxic. In a cytoprotective role, a partial inhibition of the PTP by NO⋅ is envisaged, but it is unclear whether this would significantly impact on cytochromec release. This was examined in the next series of experiments. Fig. 5 A shows the time course of cytochrome c release during Ca2+-induced PTP opening. Superimposed is the swelling profile for these mitochondria. It is immediately apparent that ∼80% of cytochrome c is released within ∼1 min of Ca2+ addition and prior to the rapid phase of swelling. This suggests that cytochrome c release is an early event in Ca2+-induced PTP. To further determine the effects of NO⋅ on the relationship between PTP and cytochrome c release, the effect of adding NO⋅ at different times during swelling was examined. Fig.5 B shows that the addition of spermine NONOate before mitochondria or at the same time as Ca2+ inhibited the PTP, whereas the addition on the verge of the rapid phase of swelling was ineffective. A partial inhibition of swelling resulted if NO⋅was added 2 min after Ca2+, at a point after which essentially all cytochrome c had been released (Fig.5 A). This is confirmed in the inset to Fig.5 B, which shows the effect of time of the addition of NO⋅ on cytochrome c release. The relationship between the degree of swelling and cytochromec release in the presence and absence of NO⋅ is shown in Fig. 6. These data again demonstrate that in the absence of NO⋅ most cytochrome c release occurs with only moderate (25%) swelling. However, when NO⋅partially inhibits the PTP, this relationship is modified such that a much greater degree of swelling (∼80%) is required to elicit substantial release of cytochrome c. Release of mitochondrial cytochrome c to the cytosol through mechanisms related to opening of the PTP has been intensively investigated. It is well recognized that the PTP can play a central role in apoptosis (27.Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Marchetti P. Hirsch T. Gomez-Monterrey I. Castedo M. Kroemer G. J. Exp.

Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar) and that NO⋅ has specific interactions with mitochondria at the level of both cytochromec oxidase and complex III (13.Cleeter M.W.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37709-37716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Since it is also known that NO⋅ can modulate apoptosis, it was hypothesized that the mechanism may be operative at the level of the mitochondrial PTP and cytochrome c release. However, the literature is far from clear on the basic elements of this hypothesis, including an examination of the effects of NO⋅ release rate on the PTP and the temporal relationship between cytochrome c release and PTP opening. This is important, since in a cellular setting gradients of NO⋅ and varying rates and sites of formation are likely to result in partial modulatory effects on mitochondrial function. These issues were addressed in isolated mitochondria using biologically relevant rates of NO⋅ formation, and effects on PTP and cytochrome c release were determined. When administered at the start of incubations (∼20 s before mitochondria), NO⋅ was able to inhibit PTP opening at rates of NO⋅ release compatible with the physiologic range achievable by NO⋅ synthases (Fig. 1) (46.Patel R.P. McAndrew J. Sellak H. White C.R. Jo H. Freeman B.A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 385-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). This suggests that the PTP may be a target for the antiapoptotic effects of physiological levels of NO⋅. At high release rates (>2 μm/s), NO⋅restored PTP opening to control levels and, in agreement with a previous study (36.Balakirev M.Y. Khramtsov V.V. Zimmer G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), shortened the delay to the onset of PTP following the Ca2+ addition (not shown). However, such concentrations of NO⋅ are in excess of those expected to be encounteredin vivo, even under pathologic conditions with maximal stimulation of iNOS (46.Patel R.P. McAndrew J. Sellak H. White C.R. Jo H. Freeman B.A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 385-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). It is likely that at such high concentrations NO⋅ may form S-nitrosating species or react with superoxide to form ONOO− (25.Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6647) Google Scholar). Both of these reactive nitrogen species have been shown to induce PTP opening when added to Ca2+-loaded mitochondria (37.Borutaite V. Morkuniene R. Brown G.C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 38.Packer M.A. Murphy M.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and ONOO−is capable of inducing apoptosis (22.Estevez A.G. Radi R. Barbeito L. Shin J.T. Thompson J.A. Beckman J.S. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1543-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 23.Salgo M.G. Bermudez E. Squadrito G.L. Pryor W.A. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16487-16490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To elucidate which stage of the PTP was inhibited by NO⋅, experiments were performed in which NO⋅ was added at different time points after the addition of Ca2+. Fig. 5 Bshows that the time of the NO⋅ addition to mitochondria is critical in determining its effects on the PTP. The requirement for the presence of NO⋅ within 1–2 min after the initiation of Ca2+-induced swelling (traces B–D) suggests that NO⋅ is exerting its effects at an early stage in PTP development such as Ca2+ entry into the mitochondrial matrix. Fig. 2 shows that NO⋅ does indeed inhibit the ability of mitochondria to accumulate Ca2+, and consistent with the literature (40.Schweizer M. Richter C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) the likely mechanism is by inhibiting the development of a membrane potential upon substrate addition to mitochondria. Consistent with Ca2+ accumulation as a target for the inhibitory effects of NO⋅ on the PTP, Fig. 3 B shows that NO⋅ inhibits t-BuOOH-dependent PTP opening, which is also Ca2+-dependent. In addition, NO⋅ inhibited Ca2+ plus phosphate-induced PTP. Together these data support the hypothesis that NO⋅inhibits the PTP by inhibiting membrane potential-driven Ca2+ accumulation. The addition of oxyHb to bind NO⋅ completely reverses its effects on PTP opening (Fig. 3 A). These data indicate that NO⋅ may be decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential through reversible inhibition of electron transport, possibly by binding to heme groups such as those in cytochrome c oxidase (13.Cleeter M.W.J. Cooper J.M. Darley-Usmar V.M. Moncada S. Schapira A.H.V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar) or complex III (39.Poderoso J.J. Lisdero C. Schopfer F. Riobo N. Carreras M.C. Cadenas E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37709-37716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The binding of NO⋅ to cytochrome coxidase is competitive with oxygen (13.Cleeter M.W.J. Cooper J.M. Darley-Usmar V.M. Moncada S. Schapira A.H.V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar), and thus if this enzyme is the molecular target for NO⋅ inhibition of the PTP, the concentrations of NO⋅ required to inhibit PTP opening at physiological oxygen tensions (1–5 μm) would be much lower than those observed here (at saturating, 240 μmO2). The release of apoptogenic proteins including cytochrome cfrom mitochondria is mechanistically linked to PTP opening. In agreement with this, Fig. 4 shows that inhibition of the PTP by NO⋅ also inhibits cytochrome c release. This suggests that the PTP may be a target for the antiapoptotic effects of NO⋅. In a cytoprotective role, complete inhibition of PTP opening by NO⋅ is unlikely and would be detrimental through inhibition of ATP synthesis (16.Leist M. Single B. Naumann H. Fava E. Simon B. Kuhnle S. Nicotera P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17.Leist M. Single B. Naumann H. Fava E. Simon B. Kuhnle S. Nicotera P. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 249: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In order to more precisely understand the cytoprotective role of NO⋅, a series of experiments were performed to determine the temporal relationship between PTP opening and cytochrome c release and the effects of varying rates of NO⋅ on these parameters. Cytochrome c release is an early event in PTP opening, and consistent with this observation, the addition of NO⋅ to mitochondria 2 min after Ca2+ is moderately effective at preventing swelling but completely ineffective at inhibiting cytochromec release (Fig. 5, B and inset). In the absence of NO⋅, the relationship between cytochromec release and swelling is hyperbolic in character, such that very little swelling is required for almost complete cytochromec release. This result may partly explain some observations that cytochrome c release can occur in cells without appreciable signs of PTP opening (47.Eskes R. Antonsson B. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Richter C. Sadoul R. Mazzei G. Nichols A. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). In the presence of NO⋅, the curve in Fig. 6 is shifted significantly to the right, indicating that a far greater degree of swelling is required to elicit cytochromec release. This has significant implications for the role of NO⋅ in apoptosis and suggests that acute control of cytochromec release is an antiapoptotic target for NO⋅. In summary, we have identified inhibition of mitochondrial PTP opening as a novel site of action for NO⋅ signaling in apoptosis. The mechanism involves depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane and inhibition of Ca2+ accumulation. Clearly, in the cellular setting the effects of NO⋅ on mitochondrial function are not expected to result in complete inhibition of respiration but favor partial inhibition of mitochondria. In turn, it is postulated that this would result in NO⋅ lowering the concentration of cytochromec available to initiate apoptosis. These experiments suggest that a fine balance exists between the pro- and antiapoptotic properties of NO⋅ at the level of the mitochondrion. We thank Rakesh Patel for providing purified oxyHb."

This bacterium expresses a variety of virulence factors that participate in the process of infection. These include MSCRAMMs (microbial surface componentsrecognizing adhesive matrixmolecules) that mediate the adherence of the bacteria to host extracellular matrix components, such as collagen, fibronectin (Fn), and fibrinogen (Fg). Two Fn-binding MSCRAMMs, FnbpA and FnbpB, have been previously identified. The Fn binding activity has been localized to the ∼40-amino acid residue D repeats in the C-terminal part of these proteins. However, no biological activity has yet been attributed to the N-terminal A regions of these proteins. These regions exhibit substantial amino acid sequence identity to the A regions of other staphylococcal MSCRAMMs, including ClfA, ClfB, and SdrG (Fbe), all of which bind Fg. This raises the question of whether the Fn-binding MSCRAMMs can also bind specifically to Fg. In this report, we show that a recombinant form of the A region of FnbpA does specifically recognize Fg. We localize the binding site in Fg for recombinant FnbpA to the γ-chain, in particular to the C-terminal residues of this polypeptide, the site also recognized by ClfA. In addition, we demonstrate that recombinant FnbpA can compete with ClfA for binding to both immobilized and soluble Fg. By the use of surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and fluorescence polarization, we determine the dissociation equilibrium constant for the interaction of recombinant FnbpA with intact immobilized Fg and with a synthetic C-terminal γ-chain peptide, respectively. Finally, by overexpressing FnbpA in a mutant strain of S. aureus that lacks the expression of both ClfA and ClfB, we show that native FnbpA can mediate the interaction of S. aureus with soluble Fg.

It is a highly versatile bacterium that is capable of causing a wide spectrum of diseases. These range from superficial skin infections to more serious and potentially fatal illnesses such as endocarditis, septic arthritis, pneumonia, and septicemia. It is also a major cause of infections associated with indwelling medical devices, such as catheters and prostheses (1.Rupp M.E. Crossley K.B. Archer G.L. The Staphylococci in Human Disease. Churchill Livingstone, New York1997: 379-399Google Scholar). S. aureus produces a variety of cell surface-associated and extracellular factors that enable the bacteria to colonize and multiply within the host, evade host defenses and destroy host tissue, causing the symptoms of disease. Colonization of host tissue is considered a critical first step in the infection process. A family of cell surface adhesins, called MSCRAMMs1(microbial surface componentsrecognizing adhesive matrixmolecules), that specifically bind to host extracellular matrix components, are involved in this colonization (2.Patti J.M. Allen B.L. McGavin M.J. Höök M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 585-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar, 3.Patti J.M. Höök M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). S. aureus MSCRAMMs that bind to collagen, fibronectin (Fn), and fibrinogen (Fg) have been identified and characterized in detail (reviewed in Ref. 4.Foster T.J. Höök M. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 484-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Fg is a 340-kDa glycoprotein that is found at a concentration of ∼9 μm in the blood. It is composed of six polypeptide chains, two Aα-, two Bβ-, and two γ-chains, that are arranged in a symmetrical dimeric structure. Fg is an important clotting protein that participates in controlling blood loss following vascular injury. It acts as an adhesive protein that mediates platelet adherence and aggregation at sites of injury by interacting with the integrin αIIbβ3 on the platelet surface. In addition, it is cleaved by thrombin to form fibrin, which is the major component of blood clots. Various cleavage products of Fg and fibrin, released during coagulation and fibrinolysis, respectively, also exhibit biological activities. These include the regulation of cell adhesion, cell spreading, and vasoconstrictive and chemotactic activities (reviewed in Ref. 5.Herrick S. Blanc-Brude O. Gray A. Laurent G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Fg is also one of the main proteins deposited on implanted biomaterials. S. aureus expresses a large number of proteins that can bind specifically to Fg. Some of these proteins are MSCRAMMs, such as the clumping factors A and B (ClfA and ClfB) (6.McDevitt D. Francois P.

The Fnbps have structural features that are common to other surface proteins expressed by Gram-positive bacteria, including ClfA (Fig. 1). A signal sequence (region S), involved in Sec-dependent transport of the proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane, is located at the N terminus of these proteins. At the C terminus are features that are required for anchoring the proteins to the cell wall. These include a stretch of hydrophobic residues (region M), thought to span the cell membrane, and an LPXTG motif that is the target of a specific enzyme (“sortase”). This enzyme cleaves the motif between the threonine and glycine residues and subsequently covalently anchors the protein to the peptidoglycan cell wall (24.Schneewind O. Fowler A. Faull K.F. Science. 1995; 268: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 25.Ton-Hat H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol.

Science. 1999; 285: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). The Fn binding activity of the Fnbps has been localized to the ∼40-amino acid residue repeat units (D repeats) at the C terminus of these proteins. FnbpA and FnbpB ofS. aureus strain 8325-4 both contain four tandemly repeated units (D1–D4), and a fifth repeat (Du) is found ∼100 amino acid residues N-terminal to D1 (22.Signäs C. Raucci G. Jönsson K. Lindgren P.-E. Anantharamaiah G.M. Höök M. Lindberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 23.Jönsson K. Signäs C.

Biochem. 1998; 258: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These repeats are highly conserved between the two proteins (∼94% amino acid identity), and homologous repeats are also found in the Fn-binding MSCRAMMs expressed by several streptococcal species (28.Joh H.J. House-Pompeo K. Patti J.M. Gurusiddappa S. Höök M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6086-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The N-terminal A regions of the Fnbps are ∼500 amino acid residues long and are less similar, sharing ∼40% amino acid identity. In the case of FnbpA, two further repeats (B repeats) of ∼30 amino acid residues, of unknown function, are located at the C-terminal end of the A region. No biological activity has yet been attributed to the A regions of the Fnbps. However, it has been noted previously that the A region of FnbpA exhibits substantial amino acid sequence similarity with the A region of ClfA (6.McDevitt D. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 111: 237-248Crossref Scopus (444) Google Scholar). This raises the question of whether this Fn-binding MSCRAMM can also bind specifically to Fg. In this report, we investigate this possibility and show that a recombinant form of the A region of FnbpA does specifically recognize Fg. We localize the binding site in Fg for recombinant FnbpA to the γ-chain, in particular to the C-terminal residues of this polypeptide. In addition, we demonstrate that recombinant FnbpA can compete with ClfA for binding to both immobilized and soluble Fg. By the use of surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and fluorescence polarization, we determine the dissociation equilibrium constant for the interaction of recombinant FnbpA with intact immobilized Fg and with a synthetic C-terminal γ-chain peptide, respectively. Finally, by overexpressing FnbpA in a mutant strain of S. aureus that lacks the expression of both ClfA and ClfB, we show that native FnbpA can mediate the interaction ofS. aureus with soluble Fg. Escherichia colistrains carrying plasmids were routinely cultured in Lennox L broth (Sigma) or on Lennox L agar (Sigma), containing ampicillin at 100 μg/ml. S. aureus was cultured in trypticase soy broth (Difco), containing tetracycline at 2 μg/ml or erythromycin at 10 μg/ml for the selection of chromosomal markers, and chloramphenicol at 10 μg/ml for plasmid selection, when appropriate. DNA restriction and modification enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. All DNA manipulations were performed using standard procedures (29.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). E. coli strain JM101 (Stratagene) and strain Topp3 (Stratagene) were made competent by CaCl2 treatment (29.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). TheclfA2::Tn917 andclfB::TcR chromosomal mutations were transduced from S. aureus strain DU5876 and strain DU5943 (6.McDevitt D. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 111: 237-248Crossref Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 7.Ni Eidhin D. Perkins S. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Höök M. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), respectively, into S. aureus strain P1 (30.Sherertz R.J. Carruth W.A. Hampton A.A. Byron M.P. Solomon D.D. J. Infect. Dis. 1993; 167: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), using bacteriophage 85, yielding strain TAMU3 (31.Foster T.J. Methods Microbiol. 1998; 27: 433-454Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmid pFNBA4, expressing FnbpA of S. aureus strain 8325-4, was tranduced from strain DU5883(pFNBA4) (32.Greene C. McDevitt D. Francois P. Vaudaux P.E. Lew D.P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) into strain TAMU3, using bacteriophage 85, yielding strain TAMU3(pFNBA4). S. aureusstrains DU5876, DU5943, P1, and DU5883(pFNBA4) were kindly provided by Professor Timothy J. Foster (Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland). A DNA fragment encoding the A region and two B repeats of FnbpA (residues 37-605) was amplified by PCR from plasmid pFNBA3 (Ref. 32.Greene C. McDevitt D. Francois P. Vaudaux P.E. Lew D.P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar; kindly provided by Professor Timothy J. Foster). This plasmid carries the entirefnbA gene of S. aureus strain 8325-4. The oligonucleotide primers used were 5′-AAAGGATCCGCATCAGAACAAAAGACA-3′ and 5′-AGAGTCGACCTACTCAGAGGACTCAGTGTA-3′. A DNA fragment encoding the full-length FnbpA (residues 37-881, which excludes regions W and M) was amplified from plasmid pFNBA3 using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-AAAGGATCCGCATCAGAACAAAAGACA-3′ and 5′-GGCGTCGACTTATGGCGTTGGTGGCACGAT-3′. Restriction enzyme cleavage sites were incorporated at the 5′ ends of the primers (underlined) to facilitate directional cloning of the PCR fragments. The PCR reactions were carried out using a Perkin-Elmer Cetus DNA thermocycler. The reactions contained 50 ng of template DNA, 100 pmol of forward and reverse primers, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm MgSO4, 250 mm of each dNTP, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 2 units ofPfu DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The reactions were overlaid with 100 μl of mineral oil and amplified for 25 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 5 min. The reactions were incubated at 72 °C for an additional 10 min upon completion of the 25 cycles. After amplification, the products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. AmplifiedfnbA fragments were cloned into the expression plasmid pQE30 (Qiagen), generating constructs pFnbpA(37-605) and pFnbpA(37-881). The recombinant proteins, called rFnbpA(37-605) and rFnbpA(37-881), respectively, contain an N-terminal extension of six histidine residues (His tag). Recombinant plasmids were cloned in E. colistrain JM101 and subsequently transformed into strain Topp3 for expression of recombinant proteins. Bacterial cell lysates containing recombinant FnbpA and ClfA proteins were prepared as described previously (19.O'Connell D.P. Nanavaty T. McDevitt D. Gurusiddappa S. Höök M. Foster T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6821-6829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 28.Joh H.J. House-Pompeo K. Patti J.M. Gurusiddappa S. Höök M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6086-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins containing the N-terminal His tag were purified by immobilized metal chelate affinity chromatography. A 5-ml HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system and charged with 87.5 mm Ni2+ and equilibrated with buffer A (0.1m NaCl and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). The cleared and filtered bacterial cell lysate was applied to the column, and the column was washed with 10 bed volumes of buffer A containing 5 mm imidazole. The bound protein was eluted with a continuous linear gradient of imidazole (5–120 mm; total volume of 160 ml) in buffer A. Fractions containing recombinant protein, as determined by absorbance at 280 nm and SDS-PAGE, were pooled, dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and applied to a 5-ml HiTrap Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with the same buffer. Bound protein was eluted with a continuous linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.5 mm; total volume of 160 ml) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. Eluted fractions were monitored by absorbance at 280 nm, and the peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), human Fg (Chromogenix AB) was made free of contaminating Fn by purification over a gelatin-Sepharose column. The purity of the Fg was then assessed by Western immunoblot analysis using anti-human Fn polyclonal antibodies (Abs, ICN Biomedicals, Inc.). The concentration of the purified Fg solution was determined by absorbance at 280 nm, using an extinction coefficient (1%) of 15.1. Fn was purified from human plasma using a gelatin-Sepharose column, as described by Vuento and Vaheri (33.Vuento M. Vaheri A. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), and the concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm, using an extinction coefficient (1%) of 12.8. The purity of the Fn was assessed by SDS-PAGE, followed by staining with Brilliant Blue R (Sigma). For surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (SPR) and the bacterial clumping assays, a commercial source of Fn-depleted human Fg was used (Enzyme Research Laboratories). Proteins were fractionated on 10% polyacrylamide gels according to standard procedures (34.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The proteins were either stained with Brilliant Blue R or transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran, Schleicher & Schuell) using a semidry blotter (Bio-Rad) and 48 mm Tris-HCl, 39 mmglycine (pH 9.2), and 20% methanol for 20 min at 15 V. Remaining protein binding sites were blocked by incubating the membrane for 18 h at 4 °C in 10% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). The E. coli strains expressing recombinant normal and mutant γ-chains were kindly provided by Dr. Susan Lord (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). For the detection of recombinant Fg γ-chains, membranes were probed at room temperature for 1 h with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-Fg polyclonal Abs (Calbiochem) in TBS, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST) and 0.1% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, followed by a 1:2000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit AP-conjugated polyclonal Abs (Bio-Rad) in TBST, 0.1% (w/v) nonfat dry milk. AP-conjugated Abs were detected using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium chloride color development solution, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). For the ligand affinity blots, membranes were incubated with the recombinant FnbpA and ClfA proteins (50 μg/ml) for 1.5 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with a 1:3000 dilution of anti-His tag monoclonal antibody (mAb,CLONTECH) in TBST, 0.1% (w/v) nonfat dry milk and a 1:20,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated polyclonal Abs (Bio-Rad) in TBST, 0.1% (w/v) nonfat dry milk for 1 h each at room temperature. Bound HRP-conjugated Abs were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). An ELISA was used to analyze the ability of recombinant proteins to bind to immobilized Fn-depleted human Fg and human Fn. Wells of a microtiter plate (Immulon 4, Dynatech Laboratories Inc.) were coated with 1 μg of Fg or Fn in TBS, pH 7.5, for 18 h at 4 °C. Plates were washed three times with TBST, and remaining protein binding sites were blocked with 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBS for 2 h at room temperature. The wells were then washed three times with TBST; purified recombinant proteins, diluted in TBS, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, were added; and the plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were again washed with TBST, and bound protein was detected by incubation with a 1:3000 dilution of anti-His tag mAb (CLONTECH) in TBST, 0.1% (w/v) BSA for 1 h at room temperature. After three further washes with TBST, a 1:2000 dilution of goat anti-mouse AP-conjugated polyclonal Abs (Bio-Rad) in TBST, 0.1% (w/v) BSA was added to the wells and the plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, bound AP-conjugated Abs were detected by the addition ofp-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) in 1 mdiethanolamine, 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 9.0, at room temperature for 30–60 min. Plates were read at 405 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Thermomax microplate reader, Molecular Devices). For the inhibition ELISAs, the recombinant proteins were pre-incubated for 1–1.5 h at room temperature in TBS, 0.1% (w/v) BSA with soluble Fg, BSA, a synthetic peptide composed of the 17 C-terminal residues of the γ-chain of Fg (GEGQQHHLGGAKQAGDV) or a scrambled version of this peptide (GHEHGLQGQGAVKDGAQ). The reactions were then added to the Fg-coated wells, and bound protein was detected with anti-His tag mAb as described above. Alternatively, bound protein was directly detected with a 1:6000–1:12,000 dilution of INDIA™ HisProbe-HRP reagent (Pierce) in TBST, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, followed by development witho-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) in 0.05% phosphate-citrate buffer with 0.03% sodium perborate, pH 5.0 (Sigma). For the inhibition ELISAs involving biotinylated proteins, the recombinant proteins were labeled using sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Biotinylated proteins were added to the Fg-coated wells together with the unlabeled proteins in TBS, 0.1% (w/v) BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Bound biotinylated protein was detected by incubation with a 1:10,000 dilution of AP-conjugated streptavidin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in TBST, 0.1% (w/v) BSA for 30 min at room temperature. Development was carried out as described above. The dissociation equilibrium constant (KD) for the interaction of rFnbpA(37-605) with immobilized Fg was determined by SPR, using the BIAcore 1000 system (Pharmacia Biosensor AB). Fn-depleted human Fg was covalently immobilized on CM5 sensor chips, as described previously (18.McDevitt D. Nanavaty T. House-Pompeo K. Bell E. Turner N. McIntire L. Foster T. Höök M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). A uncoated “blank” chip was also prepared by activating the dextran surface of the chip, followed by blocking of the activated sites with 1m ethanolamine hydrochloride. Increasing concentrations of rFnbpA(37-605), in 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, (HBS-EDTA), were flowed over four flow cells containing different amounts of immobilized Fg (2000–4000 resonance units (RU)), at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The protein was also flowed over the “blank” chip, and the background response was subtracted from the response obtained for the Fg-coated chips. Data for the construction of Scatchard plots were obtained from the equilibrium portion of the SPR sensorgrams (Fig. 7 A). Values for the Fg-bound protein, υbound, and the concentration of unbound protein, [P]free, were calculated as described previously (35.Rich R.L. Kreikemeyer B. Owens R.T. LaBrenz S. Narayana S.V.L. Weinstock G.M. Murray B.E. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26939-26945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). A plot of υbound/[P]free versusυbound yields a line for which the negative reciprocal of the slope is equivalent to the KD and thex axis intercept is equivalent to the number of sites,n, in Fg at which rFnbpA(37-605) binds (Fig.7 B). A fluorescence polarization assay was used to determine the KD values for the interaction of rFnbpA(37-605) and rFnbpA(37-881) with a synthetic peptide composed of the 17 C-terminal residues of the γ-chain of Fg (sequence described above). The peptide was labeled with fluorescein as described previously (19.O'Connell D.P. Nanavaty T. McDevitt D. Gurusiddappa S. Höök M. Foster T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6821-6829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of the recombinant proteins, in HBS-EDTA, were incubated with 10 nm labeled peptide for 3 h at room temperature in the dark. To determine the effect of divalent cations on the interaction of rFnbpA(37-605) with the labeled peptide, rFnbpA(37-605) was dialyzed extensively from HBS-EDTA into HBS (without EDTA). Ca2+, Mn2+, or Mg2+ was then added to the binding assay at concentrations ranging from 0.01 mm to 20 mm. Polarization measurements were taken with an LS50B luminescence spectrometer (Perkin Elmer) using FLWinLab software (Perkin Elmer). Binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression used to fit a binding function as defined by Equation 1,ΔP=ΔPmax·[protein]KD+[protein]Equation 1 where ΔP corresponds to the change in fluorescence polarization, ΔP max is the maximum fluoresence polarization change, and KD is the dissociation equilibrium constant of the interaction. A single binding site was assumed in this analysis. Bacterial clumping"

We observed that senescence-like growth arrest is correlated with an increase in p27Kip1 but that down-regulation of other cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, including p15INK4b, p16INK4a, p19 INK4d, and p21Cip1 as well as other negative cell cycle regulators such as p53 and p19ARF, implies that this senescence-related growth arrest is independent of the activity of p53, p19ARF, p16INK4a, and p21Cip1, which are associated with replicative senescence. The p27Kip1 binds to the cyclin/CDK2 complexes and causes a decrease in CDK2 kinase activity. We demonstrated that ectopic expression of p27Kip1 can induce permanent cell cycle arrest and a senescence-like phenotype in wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts. We also obtained results suggesting that the kinase inhibitors LY294002 and Wortmannin arrest cell growth and induce a senescence-like phenotype, at least partially, through inhibition of PI3K and protein kinase B/Akt, activation of the forkhead protein AFX, and up-regulation of p27Kip1expression. In summary, these observations taken together suggest that p27Kip1 is an important mediator of the permanent cell cycle arrest induced by PI3K inhibitors. Our data suggest that repression of CDK2 activity by p27Kip1 is required for the PI3K-induced senescence, yet mouse embryo fibroblasts derived fromp27 Kip1−/− mice entered cell cycle arrest after treatment with LY294002. We show that this is due to a compensatory mechanism by which p130 functionally substitutes for the loss of p27Kip1. This is the first description that p130 may have a role in inhibiting CDK activity during senescence.

Pereira-Smith O.M. Science. 1996; 273: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The biological significance of replicative senescence has been highlighted by observations showing that the in vitro life span of cells is related to the age of the donor as well as the general life expectancy of the species (4.Sedivy J.M.

The molecular basis underlying this physiological process and how it is overcome in tumor cells is at present not very well understood. Nevertheless, replicative senescence is associated with specific physiological and morphological changes (3.Smith J.R. Pereira-Smith O.M. Science. 1996; 273: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), including a reduction in proliferative capacity that is refractory to mitogenic stimulation, telomere shortening, adoption of a flat and enlarged cell shape, and the appearance of senescence-related β-galactosidase activity in human cells (2.Dimri G.P.

Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5239) Google Scholar), whereas p53 presumably may act indirectly by inducing the transcription ofp21 Cip1 (14.El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7936) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that pRB is present in its hypophosphorylated forms in senescent cells (15.Stein G.H. Beeson M. Gordon L. Science. 1990; 249: 666-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that the increased expression of p21Cip1and p16INK4A detected in senescent cells can arrest cell cycle progression through inhibition of the G1 cyclin-dependent CDK activity and, thereby, can prevent the phosphorylation of pRB. The hypophosphorylated pRB will in turn repress transcription factors, including E2F, which regulate the expression of genes essential for cell cycle progression (16.Lam E.W.-F. La Thangue N.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 17.Nevins J.R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Jakoi L. J. Cell.

Indeed, E2F-regulated genes including cyclin A and E,CDK2, CDC2, dihydrofolate reductase(DHFR), and E2F1 have been demonstrated to be down-regulated in a variety of senescent cells (19.Stein G.H.

These genes that have been implicated in the senescence program are somatically mutated in a variety of cancers, and such mutations to these genes may contribute to development of malignant clones (22.Wynford-Thomas D. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 100-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The INK4a/ARF locus encodes two potent tumor suppressor proteins, p16IINK4a and p19ARF, that regulate the antiproliferative and tumor suppressor functions of pRB and p53 proteins (23.Greenblatt M.S. Bennett W.P. Hollstein M. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4855-4878PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4312) Google Scholar), respectively. Recent evidence has shown that expression of p19ARF alone is sufficient to induce cell cycle arrest (25.Quelle D.E. Cheng M. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and the ability of p19ARF to induce cell cycle arrest depends on the presence of functional p53 and is achieved through stabilization of p53; p19ARF sequesters the oncogene MDM2, thus preventing the MDM2-induced degradation of p53 (26.Kamijo T.

Though oncogenic Ras can transform immortal rodent cells to a tumorigenic state, introduction of oncogenic Ras into primary fibroblasts can trigger premature senescence through the activation of the tumor suppressors p16INK4A, p19ARF, and p53 (30.Serrano M. Gomez-Lahoz E. DePinho R.A. Beach D. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1995; 267: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 31.Palmero I. Pantoja C. Serrano M. Nature. 1998; 395: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The ability of the oncogenic Ras to transform immortal rodent cell lines involves its capacity to interact and activate a range of downstream effectors, including Raf-1, phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), and Ral.GDS (32.Spaargaren M. Bischoff J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12609-12613Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 33.Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J.

Although the involvement of these signaling pathways in mediating the senescence process is unclear, constitutive activation of molecules along the Raf-1/mitogen-activated protein kinase-signaling cascade, including Raf-1, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases, and mitogen-activated protein kinases, have been demonstrated to induce premature senescence through activating p16INK4A and p53 (35.Zhu J.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). PI3Ks are a group of lipid kinases that catalyze the specific phosphorylation of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides at position 3 (37.Domin J. Waterfield M.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and are involved in a variety of cellular responses, including cell growth, survival, metabolism, differentiation, cytoskeletal organization, and membrane trafficking (38.Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Several nematode genes, including age-1, daf-2, akt-1,akt-2, and daf-16, shown to affect the life span of Caenorhabditis elegans, have been identified to encode homologues of molecules making up the PI3K signal transduction pathway. For instance, AGE-1 is a nematode homologue of the p110 subunit of PI3K; DAF-2 encodes a member of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor family, which generally signals through PI3K; AKT-1 and AKT-2 are nematode homologues of mammalian Akt/protein kinase B, which commonly acts downstream of PI3K; DAF-18 encodes the phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10, which is an antagonist of PI3K activity, by removing the 3-phosphate from 3-phosphoinositides; and DAF- 16 is a member of the forkhead/winged-helix family of transcriptional regulators (39.Hekimi S. Lakowski B. Barnes T.M. Ewbank J.J. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 14-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These findings from C. elegans strongly suggested that the PI3K signal transduction pathway has a role in mediating senescence signals. Apart from an isolated study showing that inhibitors of PI3Ks can shorten the life span of the human diploid fibroblast cell line WI-38 (40.Tresini M. Mawal-Dewan M. Cristofalo V.J. Sell C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1-4PubMed Google Scholar), the role of PI3Ks in mediating senescence in mammalian cells has not been investigated. In the present study, we explore the role of PI3Ks in regulating cell proliferation and senescence as well as the mechanisms involved. Wild-type mice and mice with deletion of INK4a/ARF (41.Serrano M. Lee H. Chin L. Cordon-Cardo C. Beach D. DePinho R.A.

Primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from day 13.5 embryos derived form the corresponding colonies of wild-type or gene “knock-out” mice as described previously (45.Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar). Briefly, each embryo was dispersed and trypsinized for 20 min at 37 °C, and the resultant cells were grown for 1 day in a 10-cm diameter tissue culture plate. The cells were then replated onto a 15-cm dish and allowed to grow for 2 days. These cells, designated passage number 0 cells, were stored in liquid nitrogen for later use. MEFs derived from ARF −/− mice were kindly provided by Dr. Charles Sherr. The MEFs were cultured and passaged as described previously (46.Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (2004) Google Scholar). Briefly, 106 cells were replated every 3 days on 10-cm plates. MEFs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. For kinase inhibitor treatment, fibroblasts were grown to 60% confluence and the tissue culture medium changed before addition of inhibitors. Cells were treated for 24–48 h with PD98059 (50 μm; Calbiochem) or LY294002 (25 μm; Calbiochem) or Wortmannin (10 nm; Calbiochem) unless specified otherwise. Western blot cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells with a cell volume of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA (pH.8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mmNaF, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate) packed three times on ice for 20 min. The protein yield was quantified using the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay kit. Samples corresponding to 50 μg of lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and recognized by appropriate antibodies. The antibodies against p15 (M-20), p16INK4a (M-156), p18INKc (M-168), p19INK4d (M-167), p21Kip1 (M-19), p57Kip2 (M-20), p107 (C-18), CDK2 (M-2), p27Kip1 (C-19), and cyclin E (M-20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-p19ARFARF (R562) antibody was purchased from ABCam. Anti-p130 (anti-pRB2) and anti-p27Kip1 (K25020) monoclonal antibodies were acquired from Transduction Laboratories. The antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Dako) and visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitation and CDK2 kinase assays, cells collected were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA (pH.8.0), 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein lysates (100 μg) were then incubated with 5 μg of anti-CDK2 (M-2) for 2 h at 4 °C. At 4 h, 50% protein A-Sepharose beads (20 μl; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in lysis buffer were added and the mixture was incubated for an additional 2 h. The anti-CDK2 immunoprecipitates were then washed substantially and resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol), supplemented with 2.5 μg of histone H1 (Sigma) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Reaction mixtures were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and the phosphorylated histone H1 was resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were then dried and exposed to x-ray films. For immunodepletion experiments, two extra immunoprecipitations were performed with the anti-p27Kip1 antibody (K25020). Phoenix cells (5 × 106) were plated in a 10-cm dish, incubated for 24 h, and then transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation (47.Lam E.W.-F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) with 20 μg of the p27Kip1-expressing retroviral plasmid, pLPC-h p27Kip1, or the empty control vector, pLPC (16 h at 37 °C) (30.Serrano M. Gomez-Lahoz E. DePinho R.A. Beach D. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1995; 267: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). After 48 h, the virus-containing medium was filtered (0.45-μm filter; Millipore) and supplemented with 4 μg/ml Polybrene. Recipient cells were plated the night before the infection at 8 × 105 cells per 10-cm dish. Retrovirus-containing supernatants were added to the target cells, and plates were centrifuged for 1 h at 1500 rpm and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Infected cells were selected 16 h later by incubating the cell population with medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin. For AFX and p27Kip1 transduction, MEFs were infected with 20 μg of retroviral plasmid, pBabe-p27Kip1, or pBabe-AFX (48.Medema R.H. Kops G.J.P.L. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M.T. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar) or the empty control vector pBabe-puro for 16 h at 37 °C. Cell cycle analysis was performed by combined propidium iodide and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) staining. Subconfluent cells with or without drug treatment were labeled for 30 min with 10 μm BrdUrd (Sigma). Cells were trypsinized, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in PBS, before fixing in 80% ethanol. The fixed cells were incubated first with 2 mHCl, then with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature, and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibodies at 1:3 dilution for 30 min, with PBS washes between each treatment. The cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1 mg/ml RNase A, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% trisodium citrate for 30 min prior to analysis using a Becton Dickinson FACSort analyzer. The cell cycle profile was analyzed using Cell Quest software. Cell proliferation was monitored by [3H]thymidine incorporation assays. MEFs were seeded into 96-well plates at 2 × 103 cells per well and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and 10% FCS. [3H]thymidine was added for the final 20 h of the indicated times. Cells were collected, and [H3]thymidine incorporation into DNA was quantified by scintillation counting. Each point was determined in triplicate, and each growth curve was performed at least twice. A previous report has described that the specific PI3K inhibitor LY294002 induces a senescence-like growth arrest in human diploid fibroblasts (40.Tresini M. Mawal-Dewan M. Cristofalo V.J. Sell C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1-4PubMed Google Scholar). To further define the nature of this LY294002-induced cell cycle arrest and to explore the underlying molecular mechanism involved, we studied the effects of LY294002 on the proliferative activity of primary mouse fibroblasts. To this end, asynchronous exponentially growing early passage (≤2) embryo fibroblasts plated at low cell density were treated with various doses of LY294002. The proliferative activity was monitored by cell count and by flow cytometric analyses of BrdUrd and propidium iodide incorporation. The growth curves (Fig.1 A) demonstrated that, while the untreated population continued to grow exponentially over the time course, there was a significant decline in proliferation rates in the LY294002-treated cells. At 25 μm or higher concentrations of LY294002, complete growth arrest was evident by 24 h. Similar results were observed in the flow cytometric analyses (Fig.1 B). Again, ≥25 μm LY294002 was sufficient to induce a noticeable diminution in BrdUrd uptake, suggesting these concentrations of LY294002 caused a significant decrease in cells entering S phase (Fig. 1 B). Both the BrdUrd and propidium iodide staining indicated that the LY294002-treated cells were arrested predominantly at the G1 phase of the cell cycle. These dose-dependent proliferation results also showed that, under our experimental conditions, 25 μm LY294002 could induce cell cycle arrest by 24 h but did not trigger noticeable cell death. This concentration of LY294002 has also been demonstrated previously to selectively inhibit PI3K activity in vivo (49.Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, therefore, is used in the rest of this study for treating mouse embryo fibroblasts. It has been shown previously that replicative senescent cells display “flat cell” morphology, irreversibly arrest during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and express increased levels of p16INK4a, p21Kip1, and p19ARF and augmented activity of p53 (5.Alcorta D.A.

To further establish that LY294002 could induce cellular senescence in mouse embryo fibroblasts, we investigated the cell morphology and expression of these senescence markers in LY294002-arrested cells. The ability of these LY294002-arrested fibroblasts to re-enter DNA synthesis after mitogenic stimulation was also assayed. To also confirm that the senescence induced by LY294002 was a result of selective blockage of PI3K activity, the effects of another specific inhibitor of PI3K, Wortmannin (51.Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296(Pt 2): 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar) was also investigated. As a control, an inhibitor (PD98059) (52.Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar) of another cellular kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1, which is important for cell proliferation, was also included in this study. Examination of the fibroblasts 24 h after PI3K inhibitor treatment indicated that the proliferation was arrested (Fig.2 A) and that they started to acquire enlarged and flat cell morphology after either LY294002 or Wortmannin treatment (data not shown). There was no notable cell cycle arrest detected in the PD98059-treated fibroblasts (Fig.2 A). 5 days after LY294002 or Wortmannin treatment, almost all cells adopt enlarged and flat cell morphology (Fig. 2 B). Similar to the untreated cells, no prominent change in cell morphology was observed in the PD98059-treated cells (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, the great majority of these LY294002- or Wortmannin-treated cells remained arrested (>5 days) and did not re-commence DNA synthesis in the presence of mitogens (Fig. 2 A). These results suggested that down-regulation of PI3K by either LY294002 or Wortmannin could induce unscheduled senescence-associated cell cycle arrest. Moreover, the propidium iodide- and BrdUrd-labeling experiments also showed that the LY294002-induced growth arrest is irreversible, because these LY294002-arrested cells did not re-commence DNA synthesis even after mitogenic stimulation (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, the control, serum-starved cells re-entered S phase 24 h after stimulation with serum (Fig. 2 C). In contrast to previous findings with replicative senescent cells, Western blot analysis of these kinase inhibitor-treated cells indicated that, surprisingly, neither p16INK4a, p21Kip1, p19ARF, nor p53 accumulated after either LY294002 or Wortmannin treatment (Fig.3 A). In marked contrast to replicative senescence, these proteins declined in their expression levels after LY294002 and Wortmannin treatment, implying that these cell cycle inhibitors were unlikely to be involved in this LY294002- or Wortmannin-induced cell cycle arrest. The expression levels of these proteins were not greatly affected by the inhibitor PD98059. These results also implied that the LY294002- or Wortmannin-induced senescence-like cell cycle arrest is not regulated by exactly the same negative cell cycle regulatory molecules that control replicative senescence. To understand in greater detail the molecular mechanisms involved in this senescence-like cell cycle arrest, we examined the expression levels of other CKIs (Fig. 3 A). The subsequent results indicated that p27Kip1 increased in expression levels in response to either LY294002 or Wortmannin treatment while other CKIs, including p15INK4b and p19INK4d, decreased in levels after the administration of either LY294002 or Wortmannin. Consistent with a previous observation (53.Coats S. Whyte P. Fero M.L. Lacy S. Chung G. Randel E. Firpo E. Roberts J.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 163-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we did not detect significant levels of p57Kip2 in primary mouse embryo fibroblasts. In the majority of cases, the expression levels of these cell cycle regulatory proteins studied are not influenced by PD98059 treatment (Fig. 3 A). It is noteworthy that the dosage of PD98059 used could induce apoptosis in a B-cell line (WEHI 231) in a parallel experiment (data not shown). To explore further the relationship between this LY294002-induced up-regulation in p27Kip1 expression and the G1cell cycle arrest, we assessed the effect of different doses of LY294002 on the expression levels of p27Kip1 and on cell cycle arrest. Low passage cycling normal fibroblasts were treated wi"

Selective lift-off of the metal cathode layer is achieved by pressing a prepatterned, metal-coated silicon stamp on the unpatterned device layers. Under pressure, the metal coating on the stamp cold-welds to the metal cathode coating the underlying organic films. Subsequent separation of the stamp from the substrate results in removal of the cathode metal in the regions contacted by the stamp, resulting in submicrometer feature definition. A 17×17 passive matrix display, with a pixel size of 440 micrometers by 320 micrometers, was fabricated with this process. Cold-welding followed by lift-off of the cathode metal allows simple, cost-effective, and high-throughput large-area fabrication of organic electronic devices."
https://openalex.org/W2072433515,"Macrophage death is an important feature of atherosclerosis, but the cellular mechanism for this process is largely unknown. There is increasing interest in cellular free cholesterol (FC) excess as an inducer of lesional macrophage death because macrophages accumulate large amounts of FC in vivo, and FC loading of macrophages in culture causes cell death. In this study, a cell culture model was used to explore the cellular mechanisms involved in the initial stages of FC-induced macrophage death. After 9 h of FC loading, some of the macrophages exhibited externalization of phosphatidylserine and DNA fragmentation, indicative of an apoptotic mechanism. Incubation of the cells with Z-DEVD-fluoromethylketone blocked these events, indicating dependence upon effector caspases. Macrophages from mice with mutations in either Fas or Fas ligand (FasL) demonstrated substantial resistance to FC-induced apoptosis, and FC-induced death in wild-type macrophages was blocked by an anti-FasL antibody. FC loading had no effect on the expression of cell-surface Fas but caused a small yet reproducible increase in cell-surface FasL. To determine the physiological significance of this finding, unloaded and FC-loaded Fas-deficient macrophages, which can only present FasL, were compared for their ability to induce apoptosis in secondarily added Fas-bearing macrophages. The FC-loaded macrophages were much more potent inducers of apoptosis than the unloaded macrophages, and this effect was almost completely blocked by an inhibitory anti-FasL antibody. In summary, during the early stages of FC loading of macrophages, a fraction of cells exhibited biochemical changes that are indicative of apoptosis. An important part of this event is FC-induced activation of FasL that leads to Fas-mediated apoptosis. In light of recent in vivo findings that show that apoptotic macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions express both Fas and FasL, we present a cellular model of Fas-mediated death in lesional foam cells. Macrophage death is an important feature of atherosclerosis, but the cellular mechanism for this process is largely unknown. There is increasing interest in cellular free cholesterol (FC) excess as an inducer of lesional macrophage death because macrophages accumulate large amounts of FC in vivo, and FC loading of macrophages in culture causes cell death.

After 9 h of FC loading, some of the macrophages exhibited externalization of phosphatidylserine and DNA fragmentation, indicative of an apoptotic mechanism. Incubation of the cells with Z-DEVD-fluoromethylketone blocked these events, indicating dependence upon effector caspases. Macrophages from mice with mutations in either Fas or Fas ligand (FasL) demonstrated substantial resistance to FC-induced apoptosis, and FC-induced death in wild-type macrophages was blocked by an anti-FasL antibody. FC loading had no effect on the expression of cell-surface Fas but caused a small yet reproducible increase in cell-surface FasL. To determine the physiological significance of this finding, unloaded and FC-loaded Fas-deficient macrophages, which can only present FasL, were compared for their ability to induce apoptosis in secondarily added Fas-bearing macrophages. The FC-loaded macrophages were much more potent inducers of apoptosis than the unloaded macrophages, and this effect was almost completely blocked by an inhibitory anti-FasL antibody. In summary, during the early stages of FC loading of macrophages, a fraction of cells exhibited biochemical changes that are indicative of apoptosis. An important part of this event is FC-induced activation of FasL that leads to Fas-mediated apoptosis. In light of recent in vivo findings that show that apoptotic macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions express both Fas and FasL, we present a cellular model of Fas-mediated death in lesional foam cells. free cholesterol fluorescence-activated cell sorting Fas ligand fetal bovine serum generalized lymphoproliferative mutation low density lipoprotein lymphoproliferative mutation terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone propidium iodide (3-[decyldimethylsilyl]-N-[2-(4-methylphenyl)-1-phenylethyl]propanamide Cholesterol-loaded macrophages are critical components of atherosclerotic lesions (1Ross R.

Importantly, a recent study in an induced mutant mouse model has implicated FC loading of macrophages in the acceleration of atherosclerosis (20Fazio S. Liu L. Major A.S. Gleaves L.A. Accad M. Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Circulation. 1999; 100 (abstr.): I-613Google Scholar). FC loading probably kills cells through the inhibition of certain critical plasma membrane enzymes (21Papahadjopoulos D. J. Theor. Biol. 1974; 43: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22Yeagle P.L. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 23Tabas I. Trends Cardiovasc.

Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In fact, Papahadjopoulos (21Papahadjopoulos D. J. Theor. Biol. 1974; 43: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) demonstrated 25 years ago that FC-mediated inhibition of two critical plasma membrane enzymes, (Na+K+)-ATPase and adenylate cyclase, leads to cellular death and proposed that these events may play an important role in the development of the necrotic core in advanced atheromata.A fundamental issue related to FC-induced macrophage death is whether the cellular and biochemical processes associated with apoptosis are involved. This is an important question because death by apoptosis may have different physiological and pathophysiologic consequences compared with death by necrosis (see “Discussion”). Indeed, macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions have been shown to have cellular characteristics of both apoptosis and necrosis (25Hegyi L. Skepper J.N. Cary N.R.B. Mitchinson M.J. J. Pathol. 1996; 180: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this report we have used a series of biochemical assays, inhibitory antibodies, and genetic mutations to show that a portion of macrophages exposed to excess FC undergoes apoptosis and remarkably that the Fas pathway is involved in this process. Given recent in vivo data showing that apoptotic macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions express both Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) (26Cai W. Devaux B. Schaper W. Schaper J. Atherosclerosis. 1997; 131: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 27Geng Y.J. Liao H.S. Magovern J. Circulation. 1998; 98 (abstr.): I-48Google Scholar), our data suggest a cellular model of Fas-mediated death in lesional foam cells.DISCUSSIONOur study of FC-loaded macrophages has revealed four key findings. (a) A fraction of macrophages exposed to FC loading shows biochemical features of apoptosis, including caspase-dependent externalization of phosphatidylserine and fragmentation of DNA. (b) Inhibition of the Fas pathway by three independent means (Fas mutation, FasL mutation, and inhibitory anti-FasL antibody) partially blocks FC-induced apoptosis. (c) FC loading increases expression of cell-surface FasL. (d) FC loading of macrophages bearing FasL (but not Fas) is able to induce apoptosis when exposed to macrophages bearing Fas (but not FasL) in a FasL-dependent manner. A working model to emerge from these findings is that FC loading through the induction and possibly activation of cell-surface FasL triggers Fas-mediated apoptosis.The events studied in this report represent those occurring relatively early during the process of FC loading. The biochemical changes observed during this time period are consistent with the morphological studies of Kellner-Weibel et al. (24Kellner-Weibel G. Jerome W.G. Small D.M. Warner G.J. Stoltenborg J.K. Kearney M.A. Corjay M.H. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), which demonstrate cytosolic and nuclear condensation in FC-loaded macrophages. With more prolonged FC loading, however, the macrophages demonstrate signs more characteristic of necrosis, such as swelling of organelles and disruption of the plasma membrane (13Tabas I. Marathe S. Keesler G.A. Beatini N. Shiratori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22773-22781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A key question to emerge from these findings therefore is how early apoptosis might affect later necrosis. Future experiments in which Fas- or caspase-inhibited macrophages are studied after prolonged FC loading will address this point.The mechanism of FC-mediated induction of the Fas pathway is one of the more novel findings to emerge from this study. FC-loaded macrophages showed no increase in cell-surface Fas but did show an approximately 2–3-fold increase in cell-surface FasL. Because neither FasL mRNA nor total cellular FasL protein changed, these data most likely indicate that FasL was translocated from internal stores to the cell surface as has been reported previously with the activation of human monocytes (38Kiener P.A. Davis P.M. Rankin B.M. Klebanoff S.J. Ledbetter J.A. Starling G.C. Liles W.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1594-1598PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, Hannan and Edidin (39Hannan L.A. Edidin M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have shown that cholesterol enrichment of cells induces the translocation of a glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored protein from internal stores to cholesterol-rich domains of the plasma membrane. Although other studies implicating up-regulation of FasL in triggering apoptosis have noted a similar modest increase in cell-surface FasL (40Hsu S.C. Gavrilin M.A. Tsai M.H. Han J. Lai M.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25769-25776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we cannot be certain that the increase in cell-surface FasL in our system is enough to account for the observed induction of apoptosis. It is possible that a change in cell-surface FasL conformation, perhaps induced by an increase in the FC/phospholipid ratio of the plasma membrane, may have led to activation of this molecule. Another important mechanistic issue is related to the observation that inhibition of the Fas pathway did not totally inhibit apoptosis in FC-loaded macrophages. Future studies will attempt to identify other pathways such as those involving other death receptors (41Yeh W.C. Hakem R. Woo M. Mak T.W. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 169: 283-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 42Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar), the mitochondria (43Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar), or the endoplasmic reticulum (44Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar).Previous studies have shown that macrophages express cell-surface Fas and can undergo apoptosis when exposed to cells bearing FasL such as T cells (45Kiener P.A. Davis P.M. Starling G.C. Mehlin C. Klebanoff S.J. Ledbetter J.A. Liles W.C. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1511-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Interestingly, agonistic anti-Fas antibody, which can induce apoptosis in certain cell types, was found not to induce apoptosis in Fas-bearing macrophages (45Kiener P.A. Davis P.M. Starling G.C. Mehlin C. Klebanoff S.J. Ledbetter J.A. Liles W.C. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1511-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, we were unable to induce apoptosis using agonistic anti-Fas antibody or soluble FasL in either control macrophages or FC-loadedgld macrophages (data not shown). Thus, macrophages, like T cells (46Suda T. Hashimoto H. Tanaka M. Ochi T. Nagata S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 2045-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) and smooth muscle cells (47Sata M. Walsh K. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1682-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), require membrane-bound FasL to engage the Fas receptor. In fact, soluble FasL was inhibitory in our system (data not shown), which is similar to the situation with T cells as reported by Suda et al. (46Suda T. Hashimoto H. Tanaka M. Ochi T. Nagata S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 2045-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Because release of soluble FasL from the surface of cells (including monocytes) occurs physiologically (38Kiener P.A. Davis P.M. Rankin B.M. Klebanoff S.J. Ledbetter J.A. Starling G.C. Liles W.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1594-1598PubMed Google Scholar, 48Martinez-Lorenzo M.J. Alava M.A. Anel A. Pineiro A. Naval J. Immunology. 1996; 89: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), it is possible that this process can inhibit Fas-induced apoptosis in macrophages in vivo. Previous work examining cell-surface FasL expression on macrophages has revealed either undetectable (49Liles W.C. Kiener P.A. Ledbetter J.A. Aruffo A. Klebanoff S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) or low (45Kiener P.A. Davis P.M. Starling G.C. Mehlin C. Klebanoff S.J. Ledbetter J.A. Liles W.C. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1511-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) levels under normal conditions, consistent with the data reported herein. It is likely that this constitutively low level of cell-surface FasL expression protects macrophages from death under normal conditions.The most important issue to arise from these studies is the potential physiologic relevance of Fas-mediated apoptosis in FC-loaded macrophages. As mentioned in the Introduction, both FC-loaded macrophages and macrophage death are notable features of atherosclerotic lesions. Moreover, Cai et al. (26Cai W. Devaux B. Schaper W. Schaper J. Atherosclerosis. 1997; 131: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) have shown that apoptotic macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions, but not non-apoptotic cells, express Fas. In another study, Geng and colleagues (27Geng Y.J. Liao H.S. Magovern J. Circulation. 1998; 98 (abstr.): I-48Google Scholar) showed the presence of numerous TUNEL-positive cells in regions of carotid atherosclerotic plaques that contained FasL-positive macrophages. Whereas these observations do not prove causal relationships, they are consistent with the possibility that some of the macrophage death known to occur in lesions is triggered by FC loading and mediated by the Fas pathway.If these events do occur, what effect might they have on lesion progression? In one possible scenario, apoptosis of FC-loaded macrophages might be a protective response that allows the “safe” destruction of these potentially harmful lesional foam cells (33Kockx M.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1519-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In this scenario, the cells would condense into “apoptotic bodies,” followed by phagocytosis by neighboring macrophages and perhaps exit from lesions without release of cellular contents (50Gerrity R.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1981; 103: 191-200PubMed Google Scholar, 51Faggioto A. Ross R. Harker L. Arteriosclerosis. 1984; 4: 323-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In another scenario, apoptosis of FC-loaded macrophages may contribute to lesion pathology, particularly lipid core development, by contributing to the release of harmful molecules. As mentioned above, apoptosis can precede what has often been referred to as “necrosis” and does not always prevent release of cellular contents from dying cells (52Lemasters J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G1-G6PubMed Google Scholar, 53McConkey D.J. Toxicol. Lett. 1998; 99: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 54Brenner C. Marzo I. Kroemer G. Exp. Gerontol. 1998; 33: 543-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55Darzynkiewicz Z. Bedner E. Traganos F. Murakami T. Hum. Cell. 1998; 11: 3-12PubMed Google Scholar, 56Ogasawara J. Watanabe-Fukunaga R.

Fujita M. Kawasaki M. Kaneko Y. Hara N. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In addition, the phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies may be inhibited by the presence of oxidized lipoproteins and lipids in atherosclerotic lesions or by the cholesterol-loaded state of the phagocyte, as has been demonstrated in cell culture studies (58Chang M. Bergmark C. Laurila A. Horkko S. Han K. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Witztum J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6353-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 59Khan, M., Pelengaris, S., Cooper, M., Smith, C., Evan, G., and Betteridge, J. (1999) in 13th Annual Conf. Free Commun. III, Abstract G15, British Hyperlipidemia AssociationGoogle Scholar). Moreover, even if the initial response were the engulfment of foam cell apoptotic bodies by neighboring macrophages, these phagocytes would now be engorged with apoptotic foam cell “remnants,” including abundant lipids. Eventually, the capacity of lesional macrophages to safely carry out this process might be exceeded. Finally, the induction of FasL by FC loading of macrophages may have atherogenic effects other than those related to apoptosis, as shown by the recent study of Schneideret al. (60Schneider D.B. Vassalli G. Wen S. Driscoll R.M. Sassani A.B. DeYoung M.B. Linnemann R. Virmani R. Dichek D.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 298-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) that demonstrated that FasL-transduced arteries in hypercholesterolemic rabbits had increased numbers of intimal smooth muscle cells. Future in vivo models in which the macrophage Fas pathway is genetically altered will be required to definitively address these hypotheses.In summary, the data reported herein demonstrate that FC loading of macrophages leads to an apoptotic response that is partially dependent on induction of the Fas pathway. In vivo, lesional macrophages accumulate excess FC, have been shown to bear Fas and FasL, and undergo apoptosis. Therefore, the model described herein provides the basis for future studies directed toward the role of macrophage death in general and Fas-mediated apoptosis in particular in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. Cholesterol-loaded macrophages are critical components of atherosclerotic lesions (1Ross R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar), and recent in vivo studies have demonstrated the importance of these cells in lesion progression (2Smith J.D. Trogan E.

These challenges stand unmet largely because of the difficulty of applying patch-clamp methods and the tools of molecular biology to sperm. The poorly understood nature of the modifications to sperm that occur between mating and fertilization (“capacitation”) presents an additional barrier to investigation.Several indirect approaches have been informative. Probing of a germ line cell library for mRNA of Ca2+ channel α1 subunits found predominant message for α1E (4.Liévano A. Santi C.M. Serrano C.J. Treviño C.L. Bellvé A.R. Hernández-Cruz A.

Finally, pharmacological sensitivities for spermatid Ca2+ currents showed some parallels with those for Ca2+-mediated responses of sperm (8.Arnoult C. Villaz M. Florman H.M. Mol.

On the basis of these results, it was proposed that a T-type Ca2+ channel is specified by α1E and is retained after spermiogenesis to provide the major route for depolarization-evoked entry of Ca2+ into sperm.Newer work has shown that expression of α1E produces R-type rather than T-type channels (10.Randall A.D.

If these proteins are functionally active, then P/Q- and L-type channels also might provide routes for entry of Ca2+(see Table I).Table IVoltage-gated Ca 2+ channel nomenclature, composition, expression, and functional activityChannelSubunitCurrentmRNA in spermatogenic cellsProtein in spermActivity in present studyCaV1.1α1SLnoCaV1.2α1CL++noCaV1.3α1DLnoCaV1.4α1FLnoHVACaV2.1α1AP/Q++noCaV2.2α1BN+yesCaV2.3α1ER++yesLVACaV3.1α1GT+noCaV3.2α1HT+noCaV3.3α1ITno Open table in a new tab Here, we use the kinetics of depolarization-evoked increases in the intracellular free [Ca2+] (Cai) of epididymal sperm to monitor the activity of voltage-gated Ca2+channels and examine their pharmacological sensitivity. The results indicate that a portion of the observed activity requires opening of N-type Ca2+ channels, specified by α1BCa2+ channel proteins that are detected here for the first time in sperm and sperm extracts. The properties of the residual component of response are consistent with involvement of R-type channels, presumably specified by the α1E proteins found in past work. Contrary to expectations, blockers of L-, P/Q-, and T-type channels were ineffective. It remains possible that functional forms of these channels are present but of low abundance or not opened by the stimulus protocols used. These observations are summarized in Table I.RESULTSIn the work here, indo-1 emission-ratio photometry reports spatially averaged Cai signals with an acceptable noise level from single sperm, sampled for 50 ms at 20 Hz for up to 60 s. Routinely, we examine small groups of 3–6 cells at a reduced excitation intensity to permit recordings lasting several minutes. Indo-1 photometry also allows continuous illumination with >600-nm light to provide bright field video images of the individual cells, which are motile but nonprogressive, oscillating about a point of attachment at the tip or base of the head. Cell viability is thus ensured. The photometric recording apparatus is synchronized with a local perfusion device that provides rapid application and removal of various test solutions and thus allows examination of reversibility and the kinetics of response and recovery.Elevation and Recovery of Cai Evoked by Brief Perfusion with a Depolarizing MediumFig. 1shows representative photometric Cai records and their analysis. In Fig. 1 A, sperm received five depolarizing stimuli by ∼10-s perfusions with the alkaline, K+-substituted medium K8.6. In the first trial, Cairose rapidly from a resting value of ∼100 to ∼500 nmand then recovered more slowly when the control medium was restored. The four subsequent stimuli produced even larger transient responses, indicating that brief elevations of Cai to 500 or 1000 nm do not irreversibly inactivate Ca2+ entry or the extrusion of Ca2+ that leads to recovery.After a short lag, Cai rose linearly for the duration of the applied stimuli (Fig. 1 B). Rates of rise, from regression analysis of Cai responses in this and 15 similar experiments, showed a cell-to-cell variation of more than 2-fold, which depended in part upon the age of the preparation. Normalization to the fastest response of each experiment removed most of this variability and revealed that the average rate of rise increased progressively during the first four stimuli (Fig. 1 C).During the recovery from depolarization, the fall in Cai was well fitted by a single exponential (not shown). Rates of recovery showed relatively little cell-to-cell variability and did not change significantly for the series of stimuli (Fig. 1 D). Average half-time for recovery was 30.3 ± 2.4 s.A Persistent Stimulatory Action of BicarbonateIn sperm, bicarbonate rapidly stimulates cAMP production and motility (25.Okamura N. Tajima Y. Soejima A. Masuda H. Sugita Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9699-9705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is required for the slow development of sperm capacitation (26.Visconti P.E. Bailey J.L. Moore G.D. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To prevent capacitation, which might obscure rapid responses, bicarbonate and bovine serum albumin were intentionally deleted from the sperm storage medium (HS). Bicarbonate also was omitted from the depolarizing medium to allow inclusion of otherwise incompatible components, such as Ni2+ or Cd2+. However, 15 mmHCO3− was included in the perfusing medium HSB to promote Cai responses to depolarizing stimuli. Fig. 1 (D and E) documents this rapidly developing enhancement, whose mechanism is still under investigation. The average rate of Cai rise evoked in the presence of HCO3− was 3.5-fold that found for stimuli applied before exposure to HCO3−. Responses evoked immediately after removal of HCO3− were slightly but not significantly (p > 0.2) faster than those observed in its continued presence. Experiments not shown indicate that the enhancing action of HCO3− is complete within a few minutes and persists for a similar period after its removal.Requirements for Evoked Elevation of Internal [Ca2+]In Fig. 2 and experiments to follow, a pair of depolarizing stimuli with medium K8.6 bracketed the test stimulus. First, we tested the need for extracellular Ca2+. In Fig. 2 A, a brief perfusion with Ca2+-deficient medium HSB preceded the test stimulus with a nominally Ca2+-free version of medium K8.6. This ensured that Ca2+ was removed before membrane depolarization began, while precluding possible depletion of internal Ca2+ stores. The depolarization in the absence of external Ca2+ evoked a barely detectable response, smaller than the transient elevation of Cai produced upon subsequent restoration of external Ca2+. Average rates of rise for the test stimulus and the two control stimuli (Fig. 2 B, left panel) show that responses to alkaline-depolarization require external Ca2+ and therefore represent Ca2+entry. Fig. 2 B (right panel), summarizing similar experiments in which the test stimulus was an alkaline version of medium HS (Na8.6), shows that elevation of external pH without depolarization does not evoke a substantial Cai response.Figure 2Negligible increases in Ca i produced by elevation of internal or external pH or by depolarization in the nominal absence of external Ca2+. A, Cai responses from cells transferred to and perfused with medium HSB, stimulated with K8.6, and then perfused again with HSB. After recovery, a second stimulus with a Ca2+-free version of K8.6 was preceded and followed by ∼5-s perfusion with a nominally Ca2+-free HSB.

Physiol. 1998; 112: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) indicated that increased internal pH also can cause Cai to rise. Fig. 2(C and D) compares responses to alkaline depolarization with responses evoked by elevation of internal pH with NH4+. Control and test stimuli were applied soon after starting a brief perfusion with medium HS (to remove external HCO3−). Although NH4+ evokes a slight increase in Cai, the mean rates of rise (Fig. 2 D) in response to 25 (left panel) or 15 mm (right panel) NH4+ are much smaller than in response to the alkaline depolarizing medium (K8.6).Sensitivity of Evoked Responses to Inorganic and Organic Ca2+ Channel BlockersTo determine the kind of Ca2+ channels involved, we examined responses to a test stimulus applied in the absence or presence of various blockers of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The protocols were similar to those of Fig. 2. Rates of response to the middle, test stimulus were normalized to the mean of the rates for the bracketing control stimuli. The first bar of Fig.3 A validates this normalization procedure. The average normalized response for test stimuli applied in the absence of blocker was 1.01 ± 0.04. Similar analysis of the first three responses in the experiments of Fig. 1 C yielded an average value of 1.04 ± 0.06. Fig.3 A also reports relative dose-dependent sensitivities of evoked responses to Ni2+ and Cd2+. At 10 μm, Ni2+ was ineffective, at 30 μm it caused 31 ± 4% inhibition, and at 100 μm it produced only a marginally greater inhibition (41 ± 5%). Inhibition of a similar extent (39 ± 4%) was produced by 30 μm Cd2+, but inhibition by 100 μm Cd2+ (74 ± 3%) was nearly 2-fold greater than that by Ni2+. Blockade by 300 μm Cd2+ was nearly complete (87 ± 4%). Thus, evoked responses may use two types of channels. Moderate concentrations of Ni2+ apparently block one but not the other, and both are sensitive to Cd2+.Figure 3Inhibition of evoked responses by inorganic and organic blockers of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.Rates of rise from regression analysis of Cai responses in experiments similar to those shown in Fig. 2. Responses to a middle test stimulus were first normalized to the mean of the rates for the bracketing control stimuli, then averaged. A, initial and terminal stimuli with medium K8.6 bracketed either a stimulus with unmodified K8.6 (None; n = 14) or with K8.6 containing the indicated concentrations of NiCl2(n = 22, 25, and 15) or CdCl2(n = 22, 15, and 25). B, the test stimulus was with K8.6 that variously contained the indicated concentrations of nitrendipine (Nitr; n = 17 and 10), PN200–110 (PN; n = 20), or mibefradil (Mib; n = 6, 13, and 12). The test stimulus was preceded by 30 s of perfusion with medium HSB that contained the same concentration of these agents as the K8.6 test solution.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3 B examines the effectiveness of two classes of organic blockers of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Sensitivity to dihydropyridines, such as nitrendipine and the more potent PN200–110, is a hallmark of L-type Ca2+ currents but also is found for T-type currents of some somatic cells (10.Randall A.D. Tsien R.W. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 879-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). PN200–110 at 1 μm did not inhibit Cai responses of sperm to alkaline depolarization. This concentration is greater than the reported IC50 for LVA Ca2+ currents of spermatids (8.Arnoult C. Villaz M. Florman H.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1104-1111PubMed Google Scholar) and for exocytotic responses of sperm (21.Florman H.M. Corron M.E. Kim T.D. Babcock D.F. Dev. Biol. 1992; 152: 304-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Nitrendipine at 10 μm was similarly ineffective despite its reported action at this or lower concentrations on Ca2+ currents of germ line cells (6.Santi C.M. Darszon A. Hernández-Cruz A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1583-C1593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Arnoult C. Villaz M. Florman H.M. Mol.

At 30 μm nitrendipine slightly enhanced Cairesponses (18 ± 6%) but caused a rapid decline in sperm motility, indicating that this result should be viewed cautiously. Apparently, Ca2+ channels sensitive to dihydropyridines do not contribute substantially to the evoked responses studied here.The nondihydropyridine, benzimidazoylyl-substituted tetraline antagonist mibefradil is a potent inhibitor of T-type currents (12.Cribbs L.L.

At 1 μm, near the IC50 for inhibition of R- and T-type currents of somatic cells (10.Randall A.D. Tsien R.W. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 879-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), mibefradil inhibited evoked Cai responses of sperm by ∼30%. At 3 or 10 μm, mibefradil produced near complete, reversible blockade, without obvious effects on cell viability.Sensitivity of Evoked Responses to Peptide ToxinsSeveral venom peptide neurotoxins target selected ion channels. This selectivity is widely used in characterization of ion currents of somatic cells but has seen little application in studies of sperm and male germ line cells.

To minimize dilution and removal of toxin, perfusion with control medium (HSB) was restricted to the first and last 10 s of the recovery period. Even on this compressed time scale, it is apparent that exposure to calciseptine did not diminish the response to depolarization. Fig. 4 (B andC) summarizes the analysis of this and like experiments. On average, the rate of Cai rise for the second of the pair of control stimuli applied before toxin treatment was slightly greater than for the first. For cells incubated in the absence of toxin (Fig.4 C), this trend continued for a third and fourth control stimulus. Rates also showed an apparent increase after toxin treatment. The greater blockade by Cd2+ than by Ni2+ found for untreated cells (Fig. 3 A) also occurred in calciseptine-treated cells (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, it is unlikely that a toxin-induced increase in the entry of Ca2+through a Ni2+-sensitive, LVA channel masked an action of calciseptine on L-type channel activity. The resistance of responses to calciseptine is consistent with the ineffectiveness of dihydropyridines noted in Fig. 3 B. Both indicate that responses here do not involve L-type channels.Fig. 5 summarizes analyses of responses observed in similar experiments with three other venom toxins. The scorpion venom kurtoxin selectively blocks the T-type currents produced by expression of α1Gand α1H subunits (34.Chuang R.S. Jaffe H. Cribbs L. Perez-Reyes E. Swartz K.J. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar); cone snail ω-conotoxin MVIIC blocks both N- and P/Q-type currents; and (ω-conotoxin) GVIA blocks N-type currents selectively (35.Mogul D.J.

Incubation with kurtoxin or MVIIC (Fig. 5, A and B) neither diminished the evoked responses of sperm nor altered their relative sensitivities to Ni2+ and Cd2+. In contrast, incubation with GVIA (Fig. 5 C) decreased the rate of evoked responses by ∼50%. Moreover, responses evoked after incubation with GVIA were inhibited only slightly more by Cd2+ than by Ni2+, suggesting that GVIA preferentially blocks the more Ni2+-resistant component of sperm responses that was identified in Fig. 3 A. The faster recovery of N- than of P/Q-type channels from block by MVIIC (38.McDonough S.I. Swartz K.J. Mintz I.M. Boland L.M. Bean B.P. J.

We investigated the biosynthesis of flavocytochrome b subunits gp91 phox and p22 phox to elucidate features of flavocytochrome b processing in myeloid cells. Although the gp91 phox precursor, gp65, was processed to gp91 phox within 4–8 h of chase, unassembled gp65 and p22 phox monomers were degraded by the cytosolic proteasome. gp65 associated with p22 phox post-translationally, within 1–4 h of chase, but prior to its modification in the Golgi complex. Moreover, p22 phox coprecipitated with unglycosylated gp91 phox primary translation product made in the presence of tunicamycin, suggesting that heterodimer formation does not require glycosylation. Blocking heme synthesis with succinyl acetone completely inhibited heterodimer formation, although biogenesis of gp65 and p22 phox was unaffected. In succinyl acetone-treated cells, p22 phox and gp65 were degraded completely by 8 h of chase, a process mediated by the cytosolic proteasome. Taken together, these data suggest that the formation of the gp65-p22 phox heterodimer is relatively inefficient and that acquisition of heme by gp65 precedes and is required for its association with p22 phox, a process that requires neither the addition of N-linked oligosaccharides nor modification in the Golgi complex.

Flavocytochromeb alone contains all of the redox components necessary for the transfer of electrons from NADPH to oxygen (15.Koshkin V. Pick E.

It is a transmembrane heterodimer, consisting of a 91-kDa large subunit (gp91 phox) and a 22-kDa small subunit (p22 phox), each the product of a unique gene (17.Royer-Pokora B. Kunkel L.M.

Recent evidence suggests that gp91 phox contains two hemes with very low midpoint redox potentials that presumably mediate the transfer of electrons from NADPH to oxygen (20.Yu L. Quinn M.T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17075-17077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition, gp91 phox has three putative sites for N-linked glycosylation that are extensively modified in the Golgi apparatus (18.Parkos C.A. Allen R.A. Cochrane C.G. Jesaitis A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 22.Harper A.M. Chaplin M.F. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 23.Dinauer M.C.

J. 1997; 321: 583-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); however, a functional role for the glycosylation has not been demonstrated. There are also conserved regions within gp91 phox containing homology to nucleotide-binding domains found in other flavoproteins such as ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase (25.Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L.

Therefore, gp91 phox likely binds both flavin adenine dinucleotide and NADPH (25.Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Kwong C.H.

This 65-kDa protein was immunoreactive with antibody specific for gp91 phox and could be readily digested with β-endoglycosaminidase H or peptideN-glycanase F to yield a protein of ∼55–58 kDa (31.Porter C.D.

More recently, we demonstrated that this 65-kDa intermediate, which we have named gp65, is the translation product of the CYBB gene, synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1as a high-mannose precursor (34.Yu L.

Phagocytes deficient in gp91 phox, p22 phox, p47 phox, or p67 phox are unable to generate superoxide and have severely reduced microbicidal capacity (35.Thrasher A.J. Keep N.H. Wientjes F. Segal A.W.

Inherited deficiency of any one of these proteins is the biochemical basis for chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a relatively rare disorder characterized clinically by recurrent bacterial and fungal infections (37.Berendes H. Bridges R.A. Good R.A. Minn. Med. 1957; 40: 309-312PubMed Google Scholar). Both X-linked CGD, reflecting a deficiency of gp91 phox, and autosomal deficiency of p22 phox are characterized by the absence of the gp91-p22 phox heterodimer (31.Porter C.D. Parker M.H. Verhoeven A.J. Levinsky R.J. Collins M.K.L. Kinnon C. Blood. 1994; 84: 2767-2775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Parkos C.A. Dinauer M.C. Jesaitis A.J. Orkin S. Curnutte J.T.

Orkin S.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1729-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). These phenotypic characteristics suggest that neither gp91 phox nor p22 phox is independently stable and that they are not targeted to the plasma membrane or specific granules individually, although direct evidence supporting the former interpretation is lacking (31.Porter C.D. Parker M.H. Verhoeven A.J. Levinsky R.J. Collins M.K.L. Kinnon C. Blood. 1994; 84: 2767-2775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,32.Porter C.D. Kuribayashi F. Parkar M.H. Roos D. Kinnon C. Biochem.

There are several examples of multimeric proteins whose proper subcellular targeting requires normal synthesis of each component subunit. Abnormal synthesis of CD18, the common β-chain subunit shared by all members of the β2-integrin family, underlies leukocyte adhesion deficiency-1 (41.Springer T.A. Thompson W.S. Miller L.J. Schmalstieg F.C. Anderson D.C. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1901-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 42.Kishimoto T.K. Hollander N. Roberts T.M. Anderson D.C. Springer T.A. Cell. 1987; 50: 193-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Leukocytes from individuals with leukocyte adhesion deficiency-1 lack surface expression of LFA-1, Mac-1, and p150/95 because, in the absence of normal β-chain synthesis, nascent α-chains cannot associate into heterodimers and thus are not targeted to the plasma membrane in a normal fashion. For both X-linked and p22 phox -deficient CGD, the majority of patients with missense mutations or small in-frame deletions or insertions lack detectable flavocytochrome b, suggesting that these mutations may interfere with protein folding and/or heterodimer formation. By analogy with leukocyte adhesion deficiency-1, one might predict that in individuals with X-linked CGD or autosomal recessive mutations of p22 phox, the absence of normal synthesis of either subunit would undermine surface expression of the functional heterodimer at the plasma membrane. As an initial step toward understanding the biogenesis of flavocytochrome b, we examined the synthesis of gp91 phox and p22 phox and the role of glycosylation in the maturation and processing of flavocytochrome b in a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line. Furthermore, we present data that demonstrate that the acquisition of heme by gp65 is a prerequisite for the formation of the gp65-p22 phox heterodimer early in flavocytochrome b biosynthesis. [35S]Methionine/cysteine (7.18 mCi/0.5 ml; specific activity, 1000 Ci/mmol; Promix), protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, and GammaBind protein G-Sepharose were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.

Where indicated, proteasome inhibitors (from 50 mm stock solutions in Me2SO) were added during the incubation in methionine-free medium and were present for the duration of the chase period. For experiments in which it was necessary to inhibit glycosylation, cells were incubated for 1 h in the presence of 5 μg/ml tunicamycin or for 2 h with 5 μg/ml brefeldin A (BFA) prior to metabolic labeling and also for the indicated chase period. To block heme synthesis, cells were cultured for 16–24 h with 10 μg/ml succinyl acetone (SA), which was present for the duration of the experiment. For experiments examining translation rates, cells were pulse-labeled for 1–15 min with [35S]methionine, followed by the addition of 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, and subsequently were diluted into ice-cold methionine-free medium containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. At the end of the labeling or chase period, cells were centrifuged at 350 ×g for 6 min at 4 °C, and the cell pellet was solubilized in RIPA buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mmNaF, 0.4 units/ml aprotinin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for at least 30 min on ice or overnight.

All immune complexes were captured for 40–60 min using 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immune complexes were washed three to four times in RIPA buffer and then resolved by 5–20% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography (see below). Where indicated, samples were digested with peptide N-glycanase F and then subjected to SDS-PAGE (44.DeLeo F.R. Goedken M. McCormick S.J. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin.

For detection of gp91 phox and p22 phox by immunoblotting, immune complexes were detected using a combination of αgp91 phox and αp22 phox. Immunoblots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (SuperSignal substrate, Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were separated by 5–20% SDS-PAGE, and gels were fixed, dried, and then exposed to Kodak X-Omat film for 16–72 h ([35S]methionine) at −80 °C. [35S]Methionine gels were quantitated using a PhosphorImager SF (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) or by densitometry using an IS-1000 digital imaging system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). To detect radiolabeled p22 phox following immunoprecipitation with αp22 phox or p22 phox coprecipitating with gp65/gp91 phox, it was necessary to expose autoradiograms 2–4 days longer than was necessary for gp65/gp91 phox. All comparative analyses were performed using the same autoradiogram at a given exposure time, i.e. a comparison of X with Y was done from a single autoradiogram illustrating X and Y. Monoclonal antibodies specific for gp91 phox and p22 phox (αgp91 phox and αp22 phox, respectively) were used to immunoprecipitate flavocytochrome b and/or individual flavocytochrome b subunits. We determined empirically that solubilization of gp91-PLB cells in RIPA buffer yielded the best recovery of flavocytochrome b following immunoprecipitation. αgp91 phox precipitated gp91 phox and its high-mannose precursor, gp65, in addition to coprecipitating p22 phox (Fig.1). αp22 phox precipitated p22 phox and coprecipitated gp91 phox ; however, coprecipitation of gp65 was not detected (Fig. 1). If p22 phox associated with gp91 phox after the modification of gp65 in the Golgi complex or if the stable gp91 phox -p22 phox complex was in significant molar excess in comparison with the rapidly processed gp65-p22 phox heterodimer, then coprecipitation of gp65 might be difficult to detect. To assess the potential binding of gp65 and p22 phox, we evaluated the processing of gp91 phox and p22 phox during the formation of flavocytochrome b in biosynthetically labeled gp91-PLB cells. Following a 1-h pulse with [35S]methionine, a 65-kDa protein, gp65, was precipitated from solubilized gp91-PLB cells using αgp91 phox, but not from X-CGD PLB lysates (Fig. 2 A, compare left and right panels, 0 h of chase). These results demonstrate that gp65 is the precursor polypeptide to gp91 phox and complement our previous studies demonstrating that gp91 phox is synthesized as a 65-kDa precursor in the ER (34.Yu L.

Cells were chased with unlabeled methionine to follow the processing of gp65 to mature gp91 phox and to elucidate the time point during synthesis at which it associated with p22 phox. Although the signal intensity for radiolabeled gp91 phox was significantly less in comparison with gp65, we found that gp91 phox was detectable by as early as 2 h of chase; however, complete maturation of gp65 to gp91 phox routinely required 4–8 h of chase (Figs. 2 A, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, and7).Figure 5Effect of brefeldin A on flavocytochromeb processing. gp91-PLB cells were cultured in the presence of 5 μg/ml BFA for 2 h prior to being pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine.

At the indicated time point, cells were solubilized in RIPA buffer, and gp65/gp91 phox or p22 phox was precipitated using αgp91 phox (upper and middle panels) or αp22 phox (lower panel).

IP, immunoprecipitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) During gp91 phox synthesis, there was loss of signal intensity over time during maturation of gp65 to form gp91 phox,i.e. the sum of signals from gp65 and gp91 phox appeared to decrease over time (Fig. 2, A and B). Using densitometry, we estimated that only 53.3 ± 4.6% of the gp65 synthesized was processed to gp91 phox (Fig. 2 B, compare closed and open triangles). However, we were concerned that this loss may be more apparent than real, as the diffuse nature of gp91 phox migration during SDS-PAGE might appear as an apparent overall loss of signal intensity on the corresponding autoradiogram when compared with tightly resolved gp65. To address this concern, we compared the signal intensities of gp65 and gp91 phox after deglycosylation using peptideN-glycanase F following metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation with αgp91 phox (Fig. 2 B,inset). Digested gp65 and gp91 phox migrated as a single protein species at ∼58 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B,inset). Densitometric analysis of the deglycosylated protein demonstrated that only 28.5 ± 10.3% of the synthesizedCYBB gene product was present at 8 h of chase when compared with that at 0 h of chase (Fig. 2 B). Since the 58-kDa core protein represents the sum of precipitated gp65 and gp91 phox, and little or no gp65 was precipitated from gp91-PLB cell lysates at 8 h of chase (Fig. 2 A), these data indicate that a significant portion of gp65 was degraded rather than processed to gp91 phox. A similar reduction in the recovery of labeled p22 phox was observed over the chase period following precipitation with αp22 phox (Fig. 2, A andC). Peak recovery of newly synthesized p22 phox was observed immediately after the 1-h pulse and decreased by 54.9 ± 12.1% by 8 h of chase (Fig. 2 C). When compared with that produced in gp91-PLB cells, p22 phox from X-CGD PLB cells was less stable. Only 30.0 ± 4.5% of the newly synthesized p22 phox remained in X-CGD PLB cells by 8 h of chase compared with 45.2 ± 12.1% in gp91-PLB cells (Fig.2 C). It is likely that all of the newly synthesized p22 phox in X-CGD PLB cells was eventually degraded since we detected very little by immunoblotting the αp22 phox immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1). The increased instability of p22 phox in X-CGD PLB cells when compared with that in gp91-PLB cells likely reflects its inability to form the gp91-p22 phox heterodimer. Porter et al. (31.Porter C.D.

It has been reported that many properly folded proteins synthesized in the ER are degraded following retrograde translocation to the cytosolic proteasome (Refs. 47.Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S.

To determine if gp65 underwent proteasomal degradation, we tested the impact of two known peptide aldehyde inhibitors of the 26 S proteasome,N-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-l-norleucinyl (ALLN) andN-acetyl-l-leucinal-l-leucinal-l-methional (ALLM), on flavocytochrome b biosynthesis (Fig.3). ALLM is 10-fold less potent at inhibiting proteasome function than is ALLN and was used as a negative control at low concentrations. ALLN at 50 μm inhibited significantly the degradation of gp65 and p22 phox (Fig. 3); levels of gp65 and p22 phox were increased 3.1 ± 0.9- and 3.9 ± 0.3-fold, respectively, by treatment with 50 μm ALLN. By contrast, a similar concentration of ALLM was ineffective at blocking proteolysis, and only at 500 μmALLM was degradation comparably inhibited (at 50 μm ALLM, the amount of gp65 increased only 0.46 ± 0.4-fold above that in untreated cells,"
https://openalex.org/W2067363611,"ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) proteins are key players in numerous vesicular trafficking events ranging from the formation and fusion of vesicles in the Golgi apparatus to exocytosis and endocytosis. To complete their GTPase cycle, ARFs require a guanine nucleotide-exchange protein to catalyze replacement of GDP by GTP and a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) to accelerate hydrolysis of bound GTP. Recently numerous guanine nucleotide-exchange proteins and GAP proteins have been identified and partially characterized. Every ARF GAP protein identified to date contains a characteristic zinc finger motif. GIT1 and GIT2, two members of a new family of G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting proteins, also contain a putative zinc finger motif and display ARF GAP activity. Truncation of the amino-terminal region containing the zinc finger motif prevented GAP activity of GIT1. One zinc molecule was found associated per molecule of purified recombinant ARF-GAP1, GIT1, and GIT2 proteins, suggesting the zinc finger motifs of ARF GAPs are functional and should play an important role in their GAP activity. Unlike ARF-GAP1, GIT1 and GIT2 stimulate hydrolysis of GTP bound to ARF6. Accordingly we found that the phospholipid dependence of the GAP activity of ARF-GAP1 and GIT proteins was quite different, as the GIT proteins are stimulated by phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate whereas ARF-GAP1 is stimulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and diacylglycerol. These results suggest that although the mechanism of GTP hydrolysis is probably very similar in these two families of ARF GAPs, GIT proteins might specifically regulate the activity of ARF6 in cells in coordination with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathways.

Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Members of the family include the six ARF proteins, the ARF-like (ARL) proteins, and the related, much larger ARD1 protein (2.Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21431-21434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar).Like other small guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, ARFs cycle between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states. Dissociation of GDP and binding of GTP to ARFs is strongly accelerated by guanine nucleotide-exchange proteins. Several ARF guanine nucleotide-exchange proteins have been isolated and characterized (reviewed in Ref. 2.Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21431-21434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Inactivation of ARFs requires hydrolysis of bound GTP. Because members of the ARF family have an extremely low intrinsic GTPase activity, an additional GAP protein is required to catalyze GTP hydrolysis. One 48-kDa GAP, ARF-GAP1, has been purified from rat liver (3.Makler V. Cukierman E. Rotman M. Admon A. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5232-5237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 4.Randazzo P. Biochem.

Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar).ARF-GAP1 is recruited to Golgi membranes by oligomerized ERD2 (6.Aoe T. Cukierman E. Lee A. Cassel D. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7305-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This membrane receptor recognizes soluble proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum that contain a KDEL carboxyl-terminal sequence for retrieval from the Golgi apparatus (7.Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). ARF-GAP1 then inactivates ARF1 and produces a phenotype identical to that observed when ARF guanine nucleotide-exchange proteins are inactivated (6.Aoe T. Cukierman E. Lee A. Cassel D. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7305-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). A distinct activity, termed ARF-GAP2, has also been purified from the same tissue (4.Randazzo P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). ARF-GAP1 and ARF-GAP2 have different phospholipid dependence, with PIP2, phosphatidic acid, and PS stimulating ARF-GAP2 more robustly than ARF-GAP1 (4.Randazzo P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recombinant ARF-GAP1 has also been reported to be stimulated by dioleylglycerol (8.Antonny B. Huber I. Paris S. Chabre M. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30848-30851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For these two GAPs, substrate specificity is restricted to ARF1–5 (4.Randazzo P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). They share significant similarities with the yeast Gcs1 protein that is also a GAP for ARF1 (9.Poon P.P. Wang X. Rotman M. Huber I.

An apparently distinct ARF GAP of ≈50-kDa, purified from rat spleen, has a broader specificity, which also includes ARF6 and ARL1 (10.Ding M. Vitale N. Tsai S.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24005-24009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Two distinct protein families containing putative zinc finger ARF GAP domains similar to ARF-GAP1 have been characterized recently, the GIT family and the ASAP1/DEF-1/PAP family. The GIT1 protein was identified in a two-hybrid screen with G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) (11.Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M.

The mRNA for the highly similar GIT2 protein, the product of the KIAA0148 gene undergoes extensive tissue-specific alternative splicing (12.Nagase T. Seki N. Tanaka A. Ishikawa K. Nomura N.

Both GIT proteins stimulate hydrolysis of GTP bound to ARF1 (11.Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The GIT proteins share a common structure, with an amino-terminal zinc finger-like motif, three ankyrin repeats, and a carboxyl-terminal GRK interaction domain. One major splice variant of GIT2, termed GIT2-short, lacks the carboxyl-terminal GRK interaction domain (35.Premont, R. T., Claing, A., Vitale, N., Perry, S. J., and Lefkowitz, R. J. (2000) J. Biol. Chem., in pressGoogle Scholar). Overexpression of GIT1 leads to reduced β2-adrenergic receptor signaling and increased receptor phosphorylation, which appear to result from reduced receptor internalization and resensitization (11.Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14082-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These cellular effects of GIT1 require an intact ARF GAP activity, suggesting a critical role of the coupling of GIT1 and ARF in β2-adrenergic receptor endocytosis.Both ASAP1/DEF-1 and PAP/KIAA0400 were identified through interactions with known proteins, the Src and Pyk2 kinases, respectively (13.Brown M.T.

They share a similar organization, with a PH domain, central ARF GAP-like putative zinc finger domain, multiple ankyrin repeats, and a carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain. Both were active as GAPs for ARF1 and ARF5, but poor GAPs for ARF6, and both were activated by PIP2 (13.Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell.

To understand the similarities and differences among ARF GAP proteins, we compared the zinc binding, ARF GAP activity, ARF family specificity, and lipid regulation of GIT1 and GIT2 to those of ARF-GAP1.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe have previously shown that GIT1 and GIT2, of which both exhibit the conserved putative zinc finger motif found in the ARF-GAP1 protein, stimulated hydrolysis of GTP bound to ARF1, without themselves binding GTP or acting as a nucleotide releaser for ARF1 (11.Premont R.T.

ARF-GAP1 is to date the best characterized GAP for ARFs. We compared the respective activities of purified recombinant, 6xHis-tagged ARF-GAP1, GIT1, and GIT2-short proteins (Fig. 1). Confirming our previous observations (11.Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem., in pressGoogle Scholar), GIT1 and GIT2 stimulated GTP hydrolysis by ARF1. The rate of hydrolysis of GTP bound to ARF1 induced by GIT1 and GIT2 was comparable to the rate of hydrolysis induced by ARF-GAP1 (Fig. 2 A). The activities of GIT1, GIT2, and ARF-GAP1 were constant for at least 20 min before slightly slowing down (Fig. 2 A), so for further assays we used 10-min incubations. In addition, the assays appeared linear until nearly 50% of the added GTP-bound ARF substrate was converted to GDP-bound ARF. GIT1, GIT2, and ARF-GAP1 stimulated hydrolysis of GTP bound to ARF1 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2, B and C). GIT1 was slightly more potent than ARF-GAP1 and GIT2-short was the least potent GAP (Fig.2 C). These results suggest that the intrinsic GAP activity of GIT1, GIT2, and ARF-GAP1 is very similar in the absence of additional cofactors.Figure 2Time course and concentration dependence of the stimulation of ARF1 GTPase activity by ARF-GAP1, GIT1 , and GIT2-short.

PIP did not increase GTP hydrolysis by any of the ARF GAPs tested here (Fig. 3). Because dioleylglycerol, produced mainly from phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis by phospholipase D (an effector of ARF), dramatically increased the activity of a recombinant fragment of ARF-GAP1, it was suggested that phospholipase D activity could be a major regulator of ARF GAPs (8.Antonny B. Huber I. Paris S. Chabre M. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30848-30851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Dioleylglycerol had similar effects on Gcs1, an analogous ARF GAP from yeast (9.Poon P.P. Wang X. Rotman M. Huber I. Cukierman E. Cassel D. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10074-10077Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We confirm that DAG (C18:1-(3)C18:1) stimulated the GTPase activity of ARF-GAP1, but no effect on the activity of GIT1 or GIT2 was found (Fig. 3). The ARF GAPs that are activated by PIP2 or other phosphoinositides are presumably subject to diverse kinds of regulation. From these results it seems plausible that GIT proteins and ARF-GAP1 are involved in distinct signaling pathways, which is also suggested by their distinct cellular localization. Centaurin-α has been described to be a potential PIP3-binding protein with similarity to ARF GAPs that could complement a yeast strain deficient in the yeast ARF GAP Gcs1 (21.Venkateswarlu K. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Jackson T.R. Cullen P.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that several ARF GAPs could be regulated by PIP3. In many cell types, the agonist-stimulated PI 3-kinase utilizes predominantly PIP2as a substrate to generate PIP3 (22.Stephens L.R. Hughes K.T. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1991; 351: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 23.Carter A.N. Huang R. Sorisky A. Downes C.P. Rittenhouse S.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The ratio of PIP2 and PIP3 seems to play a critical role in many aspects of vesicular trafficking (24.De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). It will now be of particular interest to know if signaling pathways involving PI 3-kinases or other enzymes involved in the synthesis or hydrolysis of PIP3 may contribute to intracellular regulation of GIT proteins.It was demonstrated that the amino-terminal GATA-like zinc finger motif of ARF-GAP1 (5.Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and ARD1, an ARF-related protein that has an amino-terminal GAP domain (18.Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2553-2560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), are critical for GTP hydrolysis. In the presence of GTP or a non-hydrolyzable analogue, all members of the ARF family serve as allosteric activators of cholera toxin (CTA) ADP-ribosyltransferase (25.Moss J. Vaughan M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 193: 153-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, addition of ARF-GAP1 and GIT1 reduced the ability of ARF1 to activate CTA in the presence of GTP, but not GTPγS (Fig. 4). This result confirms that GIT1, like ARF-GAP1, influences the biological activity of ARF1 by promoting GTP hydrolysis. Deletion of 45 amino acids from the amino terminus of GIT1 or ARF-GAP1 (containing the conserved zinc finger motif) completely prevented inhibition of ARF-induced CTA activation (Fig. 4), suggesting that the zinc finger motif is required for GAP activity of both proteins. We can exclude that this loss of activity results from complete misfolding of the Δ45GIT1 protein, because several additional GIT interacting proteins (GRK2, PIX, paxillin) do bind normally to Δ45-GIT1 in co-immunoprecipitation assays. 2R. T. Premont, unpublished observations.Figure 4Effect of amino-terminal deletion on the GAP activity of ARF-GAP1 and GIT1. ARF1 (1 μg ≈ 50 pmol) was incubated with 100 μm GTP or GTPγS, followed by incubation with buffer (control), or 450 ng of ARF GAPs (5.25–10 pmol), or amino-terminal deleted ARF GAPs for 10 min at 30 °C before stimulation of cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylagmatine formation was assayed for 60 min at 30 °C.

To investigate whether ARF GAP proteins actually bind to a metal through this domain, we subjected three purified ARF GAP proteins to plasma emission spectroscopy, a sensitive technique that allows for the simultaneous detection of over 20 metal ions (Table I). For each of the three ARF GAP proteins analyzed, the only metal ions detected over background were zinc and sodium (from the NaCl buffer), except for one instance, when significant calcium was also detected in ARF-GAP1/6xHis and GIT2-short/6xHis. The nanomole of zinc detected was similar to the nanomole of protein analyzed for each ARF GAP, consistent with a near one-to-one complex of zinc with protein. Recent publication of the crystal structure of the ARF-GAP1 protein amino-terminal domain bound to ARF1 reveals that one zinc ion is indeed bound by the four conserved cysteine residues of the ARF GAP domain (26.Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the metal ion does not contact the ARF protein, but appears to play a role in determining the overall structure of the GAP domain (26.Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Mutation of single cysteine residues within this zinc finger abrogated GAP activity of ARF-GAP1 (5.Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and ARD1 (18.Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2553-2560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), presumably because such mutants could not bind zinc. As GIT1 and GIT2 also appear to bind zinc, we predict that zinc chelation by this CX 2CX 16CX 2C motif is a common feature of ARF GAP proteins. The effect of removing the zinc to form the cognate apoproteins, or of replacing it with similar metal ions, remains unexplored. It is now well established that RasGAPs and RhoGAPs share a common mechanism of the GTPase-rate enhancement involving a critical arginine residue (27.Scheffzek K. Lautwein A. Kabsch W. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1996; 384: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 28.Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmüller L. Lautwein A. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). A putative arginine finger motif has also been postulated within the zinc finger region in ARF-GAP1 (29.Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and this specific arginine residue is present also in GIT1 and GIT2. Recently, data from the crystal structure of the ARF1·ARF-GAP1 complex suggested that the postulated arginine in ARF-GAP1 did not make contact with the active site of the GTPase (26.Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The function of this conserved arginine residue in ARF GAPs remains to be established.Table IZinc content of ARF GAPs assessed by inductively-coupled plasma emission spectroscopyProtein nameSampleZinc contentmgnmolμg/mlnmolGAP1 prep 12.0372.931GAP1 prep 22.2462.945GIT10.890.447GIT2 prep 12.1401.720GIT2 prep 22.1401.821The indicated amounts of Hi-Trap-Q chromatography purified His-tagged ARF-GAP1 (GAP1), GIT1, and GIT2-short proteins were analyzed for metal ions by inductively-coupled plasma emission spectroscopy.

Open table in a new tab We tested further the GAP activities of GIT1, GIT2-short, and ARF-GAP1 on different members of the ARF family. ARF-GAP1 stimulated hydrolysis of GTP bound to ARF1, ARF2, ARF3, and ARF5, but not to ARF6 (Fig.5 A), confirming previous observations that this GAP affects the class I and class II, but not class III ARFs (4.Randazzo P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). On the other hand, GIT1 and GIT2 promoted GTP hydrolysis by all five ARFs tested (Fig. 5 A). Neither ARL1 nor ARL2, members of the ARF-like family, nor ARD1, the ARF-related protein with its intrinsic GAP domain, were substrates of GIT1, GIT2, or ARF-GAP1 (Fig. 5 A). Over a range of GAP concentrations where the two GIT proteins were quite active, ARF-GAP1 failed to accelerate the GTPase activity of ARF6 (Fig. 5 B). These results suggest that ARF-GAP1 and GIT proteins are indeed specific GAPs for ARF proteins. More importantly, they indicate that unlike ARF-GAP1, both GIT1 and GIT2 can stimulate the efficient hydrolysis of GTP bound to ARF6.Figure 5Substrate specificity of ARF-GAP1, GIT1 , and GIT2-short.

ADAM12 has been implicated in muscle cell differentiation and fusion, but its precise function remains unknown. Here, we show that ADAM12 is dramatically up-regulated in regenerated, newly formed fibers in vivo. In C2C12 cells, ADAM12 is expressed at low levels in undifferentiated myoblasts and is transiently up-regulated at the onset of differentiation when myoblasts fuse into multinucleated myotubes, whereas other ADAMs, such as ADAMs 9, 10, 15, 17, and 19, are expressed at all stages of differentiation. Using the yeast two-hybrid screen, we found that the muscle-specific α-actinin-2 strongly binds to the cytoplasmic tail of ADAM12. In vitro binding assays with GST fusion proteins confirmed the specific interaction. The major binding site for α-actinin-2 was mapped to a short sequence in the membrane-proximal region of ADAM12 cytoplasmic tail; a second binding site was identified in the membrane-distal region. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirm the in vivoassociation of ADAM12 cytoplasmic domain with α-actinin-2. Overexpression of the entire cytosolic ADAM12 tail acted in a dominant negative fashion by inhibiting fusion of C2C12 cells, whereas expression of a cytosolic ADAM12 lacking the major α-actinin-2 binding site had no effect on cell fusion.

Both ADAMs and snake venom metalloprotease-disintegrins contain a metalloprotease-like domain with an associated regulatory prodomain, a disintegrin-like domain, a cysteine-rich domain, and an epidermal growth factor-like domain.

Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16993-16997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), but its physiological substrates have not been identified. The other extracellular domains of ADAMs, the disintegrin and the cysteine-rich domains, also play important roles in cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, cell differentiation, and fusion. The disintegrin-like domains of ADAMs are the most highly conserved. They seem to have retained the ability to bind to integrins and play a role in cell adhesion processes such as fertilization, as suggested by the interaction of sperm ADAM 2 (fertilin β) with integrin α6β1 on the egg (17.Bigler D. Chen M. Waters S. White J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 220-225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Two recent reports show that the disintegrin-like domain and the cysteine-rich domain of ADAM12 mediates adhesion of C2C12 cells and tumor cell lines (18.Zolkiewska A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19.Iba K. Albrechtsen R. Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Wewer U.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1489-1501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). ADAMs 1, 3, 12, and 14 possess in their cysteine-rich domain a motif similar to viral fusion peptides (1.Blobel C.P. White J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and these ADAMs are expressed in cells that participate in cell fusion events, such as fertilization, myogenesis, and osteogenesis. However, the direct involvement of such a motif in any cell fusion process has not been demonstrated yet. In contrast to the well conserved organization of the extracellular regions of ADAMs, their cytoplasmic tails are much less conserved. Approximately half of the known ADAM proteins have cytoplasmic tails of up to 200 amino acids containing consensus SH3-binding motifs, whereas others have shorter cytoplasmic tails that lack any identifiable motif. ADAM9 contains two SH3-binding motifs and binds to Src SH3 domains, but not to Abl SH3 domains in vitro (20.Weskamp G. Kratzschmar J. Reid M.S. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). A recent report from Howard et al. (21.Howard L. Nelson K.K. Maciewicz R.A. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31693-31699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) identified two SH3-domain-containing proteins that bind to ADAM9 and ADAM15. ADAM9 also binds to protein kinase C through its cytoplasmic tail, and this interaction regulates the metalloprotease activity of ADAM 9 toward its substrate HB-epidermal growth factor (12.Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Thus, these data suggest that the cytoplasmic tails of ADAMs play a role in signal transduction to regulate the activity of the extracellular region. The cytoplasmic tail of ADAM12 is among the longest of all ADAM proteins and contains potential SH3-binding motifs, suggesting of interactions with cytoplasmic proteins. Skeletal muscle differentiation and regeneration require several events, including activation and inhibition of growth factors, matrix remodeling, cell-cell interaction, and cell fusion. Some of these processes could be controlled by ADAMs. Several ADAMs are expressed in skeletal muscle. Among them, ADAM12 may play a role in muscle differentiation, as it is required for fusion of C2C12 mouse myoblasts into multinucleated myotubes (22.Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nature. 1995; 377: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Moreover, a short form of a soluble splice variant of ADAM12, which is expressed in human placenta, has myogenic activity in vivo (23.Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Mattei M.G. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 157-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). To better understand the role of ADAMs in skeletal muscle development and regeneration, we used the C2C12 myoblast cell line, derived from mouse satellite cells, as a model. We analyzed the expression pattern during C2C12 differentiation of six known ADAMs predicted to be active metalloproteases, ADAMs 9, 10, 12, 15, 17, and 19. We show that ADAM12 expression is induced at the onset of fusion, whereas the other ADAMs are constitutively expressed. We also show that ADAM12 is not expressed in normal adult muscle but is reexpressed in regenerating muscle. We also used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify cytoplasmic proteins interacting with the cytoplasmic tail of ADAM12. We show that ADAM12 interacts with the muscle-specific α-actinin-2 in vitro and in vivo. The major site of interaction is located in the membrane-proximal region of ADAM12 tail. Disruption of interaction between ADAM12 and α-actinin-2 in C2C12 cells by overexpression of an ADAM12 cytoplasmic tail prevents cell fusion. Our results identify for the first time a potential linkage between an ADAM and the cytoskeleton mediated by an actin-binding protein and suggest that skeletal muscle regeneration requires this interaction. C2C12 cells (ATCC) were grown in supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2 mm glutamine, 1 mmsodium pyruvate, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml penicillin) containing 10% fetal calf serum. When cells reached confluence, differentiation was induced by culturing in supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum. Total RNA was extracted from subconfluent proliferating C2C12 cells (D-1), confluent C2C12 cells (D0), or C2C12 cells at various days after differentiation (D1 to D7) using the Trizol Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. mRNAs for various ADAMs, myogenin, and β-tubulin were detected by one-step RT-PCR TiTan (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using 1 μg of total RNA per reaction.

Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2 50 mmoctylglucosid, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin). Insoluble material was removed by a quick centrifugation at 1000 rpm, and the supernatant was then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 45 min to recover a membrane-enriched pellet, which was extracted in lysis buffer. The protein concentration of each extract was determined using the Bio-Rad assay. Ten μg of protein were electrophoresed on 4–20% polyacrylamide gels (Novex), and proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter. ADAM12 was detected by an antiserum generated by immunizing a rabbit with a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal end of mouse ADAM12 (CHQVPRPSHNAYIK). The mouse β1D integrin antiserum has been described (24.Vachon P.H. Xu H. Liu L. Loechel F. Hayashi Y. Arahata K. Reed J.C. Wewer U.M. Engvall E. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1870-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Antibodies were used at a 1/200 dilution. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described (25.Liu L.A. Engvall E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38171-38176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Immunostaining was performed on muscle from mdxdystrophin-deficient mice, used as a model for spontaneous muscle regeneration. ADAM12 was detected with an antiserum generated against a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal end of human ADAM12 (CHQVPRSTHTAYIK), almost identical to the mouse sequence previously mentioned. The antiserum was diluted 1/200. The entire cytoplasmic tail of mouse ADAM12 was amplified using PCR from a corresponding full-length ADAM12 cDNA-plasmid and directionally inserted in-frame with the DNA binding domain of the LexA transcription factor in plasmid pBTM116 (kindly provided by Dr. S. Tartare-Deckert). DNA sequencing confirmed in-frame insertion and absence of mutations. All deletions and mutations of the cytoplasmic tail of ADAM12 were made by PCR of the specific regions and cloned into pBTM116 using the same procedure. A human skeletal muscle cDNA library, constructed in plasmid pGAD10 containing sequences encoding the GAL4 activation domain, was obtained fromCLONTECH. One and a half million transformants of the yeast strain L40 were screened according to the protocol described by Hollenberg et al. (26.Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The entire cytoplasmic tail of ADAM12 (ADAM12cyt) was sub-cloned into pGEX-5 × 1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and expressed in XL1-blue bacteria cells (Stratagene). The procedure for extraction of GST fusion proteins was standard except that 1.5% N-lauroylsarcosine was added to the lysate before extraction with 2% Triton X-100. GST alone was prepared in parallel, and GST fused to the SH2 domain of Shc (herein referred to as GST-SH2) was kindly provided by Dr. V. Dodelet. A plasmid forin vitro transcription of the full-length α-actinin-2 was kindly provided by Dr. A. Beggs. In vitro transcription and translation was performed with the TNT kit from Promega according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST, GST-ADAM12cyt, or GST-SH2 fusion proteins coupled to glutathione beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μl of [35S]Met-labeled, in vitro translated α-actinin-2 in 200 μl of binding buffer (2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin). The beads were then washed four times in washing buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol) and boiled in SDS sample buffer. Samples were electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels, and the gels were treated with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dried, and exposed to x-ray film overnight. Equivalent amounts of GST fusion proteins were electrophoresed on a separate gel and stained with Gelcode blue stain (Pierce). The entire ADAM12 cytoplasmic tail (ADAM12cyt) was expressed in pCDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). For the constructs myr-ADAM12cyt and myr-Δ45ADAM12cyt, a myristoylation motif coding sequence (GGGAGTAGCAAGAGCAAG) was inserted in-frame into the 5′ end of ADAM12cyt cDNA or -Δ45ADAM12cyt, ADAM12cyt cDNA encoding a truncated ADAM12cyt lacking the N-terminal 45 amino acids. C2C12 cells were plated in 12-well dishes and grown to 70% confluence. Two μg of vector containing ADAM12cyt, myr-ADAM12cyt, myr-Δ45ADAM12cyt, or vector without insert and 0.2 μg of CMV-β-gal vector were cotransfected into cells using the Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. The next day, cells were switched to differentiation medium. Staining for β-gal was performed on the cells after 4 days of differentiation. Each transfection was done in duplicate, and the number of blue myotubes was determined in 8 fields for each duplicate. The transfection efficiency was similar for each vector construct, as determined by the number of β-galactosidase-positive cells. In addition, analysis of the efficiency of expression of each construct transfected was performed by immunoblotting of cell lysates. ADAM12cyt, myr-ADAM12cyt, and myr-Δ45ADAM12cyt constructs were cotransfected with α-actinin-2 cDNA-plasmid in CHO cells. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer in 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 10 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, leupeptin, and aprotinin. After incubation on ice for 15 min, the lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatant was recovered. Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating the supernatant with 4 μl of the polyclonal mouse ADAM12cyt antibody or 4 μl of the corresponding preimmune serum for 4 h at 4 °C under gentle agitation. Thirty μl of protein A-Sepharose was then added for an additional 1 h of incubation. After three washes in the lysis buffer, 25 μl of sample buffer was added to the pelleted beads, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting was then performed as described above with the monoclonal sarcomeric α-actinin antibody (clone EA-53, Sigma) at dilution of 1:5000 and with the polyclonal mouse ADAM12cyt antibody at dilution of 1:1000. C2C12 cells have been extensively used as an in vitro model of skeletal muscle differentiation. As these cells are satellite cells derived from an adult mouse, they can also be considered as a model for skeletal muscle regeneration (27.Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). Therefore to define the roles of ADAMs in muscle regeneration, we analyzed by RT-PCR the expression of six ADAM proteins, all of which are potentially active metalloproteases. As shown in Fig. 1 a,undifferentiated C2C12 myoblasts express mRNAs for all ADAMs tested, namely, ADAMs 9, 10, 12, 15, 17, and 19. During differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes, monitored here by an increase in myogenin mRNA expression, ADAM12 expression increased in the early stages and then decreased between day 2 and 3, whereas the expression of the other ADAMs tested remained constant throughout differentiation. The changes in ADAM12 expression during differentiation of C2C12 cells were confirmed at the protein level by immunoblotting of extracts of a membrane-enriched fraction from C2C12 cells. An antibody directed against the C-terminal end of ADAM12 (Fig. 1 b) detected a 100-kDa protein, presumably corresponding to the full-length ADAM12, and a 54-kDa protein, likely representing a processed form of ADAM12 lacking the metalloprotease domain, as described previously (22.Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nature. 1995; 377: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). During C2C12 differentiation, here monitored by the increase in β1D integrin, full-length ADAM12 and particularly the processed form increased until day 2 and then decreased to low levels in more differentiated cells (Fig. 1 b). The changes in expression of ADAM12 during C2C12 differentiation, observed at both mRNA and protein levels, suggest a role for ADAM12 in skeletal muscle regeneration, specifically at the onset of cell fusion. Immunolocalization of ADAM12 in adult skeletal muscle revealed no staining. In contrast, in mdx muscle, which undergoes spontaneous regeneration (28.De la Porte S. Morin S. Koenig J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 191: 99-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the small, newly formed muscle fibers were strongly positive for ADAM12 (Fig.2). These results suggest that ADAM12 expression in skeletal muscle is restricted to developing myofibers during embryonic development, as described previously (29.Kurizaki T. Masuda A. Osumi N. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Mech. Dev. 1998; 73: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and during regeneration in the adult, as shown here. We screened a human skeletal muscle cDNA library in a yeast two-hybrid system using the ADAM12 cytoplasmic tail as a bait (ADAM12cyt). Out of 1.5 × 106 transformants, we isolated several clones interacting with ADAM12cyt but not with an irrelevant bait, lamin C. Among them, eight distinct clones encoding the muscle-specific isoform of α-actinin, α-actinin-2, were isolated. As linkage of ADAM12 to the cytoskeleton may be important for its function, we further characterized the α-actinin binding. Based on the overlaps between the α-actinin-2 clones, it is likely that the binding site for ADAM12 is contained within the COOH-terminal half of α-actinin, between half of the spectrin-type repeat 3 and the domain with EF-hand-like repeats (Fig. 3). To confirm the interaction of ADAM12cyt with α-actinin-2, we performed in vitro binding assays. α-Actinin-2 synthesized by in vitro translation in the presence of [35S]methionine was incubated with GST-ADAM12cyt and control fusion proteins coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Gel electrophoresis of proteins bound to the beads and autoradiography of the gel showed that α-actinin-2 bound to GST-ADAM12cyt but not to GST, GST-SH2, or the glutathione beads alone (Fig. 4 a). The quantities of GST proteins in the assay were estimated on a separate gel (Fig. 4 b). To further characterize the interaction of ADAM12cyt with α-actinin-2, we generated deletion constructs of ADAM12cyt and tested them for binding to α-actinin-2 in yeast. As shown in Fig.5, M-C and M-G, composed of the membrane-proximal 44 and 28 amino acids, respectively, interacted as strongly as did ADAM12cyt with α-actinin-2, whereas other constructs, M-D, -E, -F, and -H, did not bind at all. The C-terminal truncated Δ2, Δ3, and Δ4, which contain all the proximal part of ADAM12cyt, bound to α-actinin-2 as expected. Surprisingly, constructs Δ5′A and Δ5′B, which lack the proximal 45 and 32 amino acids, respectively, but retain the rest of the cytoplasmic tail, bound to α-actinin-2, although less strongly (Fig. 5 a). The binding affinity was estimated from β-galactosidase activity: 2.5 h of color development was required to obtain the same intensity as that obtained within 20 min with the M-C construct. This suggests that the first 30 amino acids of ADAM12cyt contain a major α-actinin-2 binding site, whereas another region, which is probably conformational, as it can not be mapped by using different deletions of ADAM12cyt, contains a minor site of interaction. The sequence of the membrane-proximal region of ADAM12cyt is unique among the cytoplasmic domains of ADAMs and might therefore confer α-actinin-2 binding to ADAM12 only among the proteins of the ADAMs family. Two arginine residues, at positions 21 and 26 from the membrane-proximal portion, are conserved between mouse and human ADAM12. To test whether these positively charged residues could be involved in the interaction with α-actinin-2, we mutated either residue arginine 21 or arginine 26 to leucines in the M-G deletion construct and tested binding to α-actinin-2. Neither of these mutations affected the interaction of M-G with α-actinin-2 (Fig.5 b), suggesting that the binding site for α-actinin-2 is probably contained within the first residues of the membrane-proximal portion of ADAM12cyt. The predicted structure of the 30 amino acids of the membrane-proximal region of ADAM12cyt is a helix, which is also a feature of some other longer cytoplasmic domains of ADAMs, such as ADAM15. To test the hypothesis that conformation of the membrane-proximal helix accounts for binding to α-actinin-2, we analyzed binding of the mouse ADAM15 (metargidin) cytoplasmic tail with α-actinin-2. We found that the ADAM15 cytoplasmic tail bound α-actinin-2, although less strongly than did ADAM12cyt (Fig. 5 b). This result indicates that other ADAM cytoplasmic domains that possess structural homologies with ADAM12cyt can bind α-actinin. To investigate the physiological significance of ADAM12cyt binding to α-actinin-2, we disrupted this interaction by overexpressing a full-length cytoplasmic tail of ADAM12 in C2C12 cells and analyzed the effects of such an overexpression on C2C12 cell fusion. To optimize the potential competition between soluble ADAM12cyt and the endogenous ADAM12 cytoplasmic tail, we targeted ADAM12cyt to the plasma membrane by adding a myristoylation site to the N terminus of the peptide. We cotransfected a β-gal reporter plasmid (ratio, 10:1) to identify transfected cells and to score, after 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) staining, the number of myotubes resulting from fusion between ADAM12cyt-transfected myoblasts. Overexpression of myristoylated ADAM12-cyt reduced fusion by 70%, overexpression of ADAM12cyt without myristoylation reduced fusion by 30%, and a truncated, myristoylated ADAM12cyt, missing the proximal region containing the major binding site for α-actinin-2, had no effect on fusion (Fig. 6 a). This experiment was repeated at least three times. Immunoblotting with an antibody specific for the C-terminal of the ADAM12 cytoplasmic tail showed that all ADAM12 constructs were equally expressed in transiently transfected CHO cells (Fig. 6 b). These results suggest that a membrane-targeted ADAM12cyt competes with wild type ADAM12 for binding to α-actinin-2 and that the ADAM12-α-actinin interaction is essential in cell fusion. To confirm that the soluble ADAM12 cytoplasmic tails bind to α-actinin-2, we did immunoprecipitation experiments by cotransfecting ADAM12 cytoplasmic tail constructs and α-actinin-2-encoding plasmid in CHO cells. Immunoprecipitations were performed with polyclonal ADAM12 antibody or preimmune serum, and a monoclonal α-actinin antibody was used for immunoblotting. α-Actinin-2 was specifically coimmunoprecipitated with myristoylated ADAM12cyt (Fig. 7 a). Fig.7 b shows that α-actinin-2 was better coimmunoprecipitated with the myristoylated ADAM12cyt than with the ADAM12cyt without myristoylation, suggesting that membrane-targeted ADAM12 cytoplasmic tail binds α-actinin-2 more efficiently. Moreover, much less α-actinin-2 was coimmunoprecipitated with the truncated, myristoylated ADAM12cyt, which is consistent with the fact that the truncated ADAM12cyt lacks the major binding site for α-actinin-2. These results demonstrate that ADAM12 cytoplasmic tail binds α-actinin-2 in vivo and that capacity of inhibition of fusion by the ADAM12 cytoplasmic tails is correlated with their capacity to bind α-actinin-2. The present study shows that ADAM12 is a marker of skeletal muscle regeneration and is specifically up-regulated at the onset of myoblast fusion. We show that the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM12 interacts with the muscle-specific α-actinin-2, and we provide evidence that this interaction is necessary for ADAM12 to promote muscle cell fusion. α-Actinin is an actin binding and actin cross-linking protein that has a crucial role in linking the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton. α-Actinin interacts with the proteins vinculin and zyxin in focal plaques (30.Wachsstock D.H.

The major α-actinin-2 binding site in the ADAM12 cytoplasmic domain was mapped to the first membrane-proximal 30 amino acids. By comparing all known bindings of transmembrane proteins to α-actinin, Heiskaet al. (39.Heiska L. Kantor C. Parr T. Critchley D.R. Vilja P. Gahmberg C.G. Carpen O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26214-26219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) noted that positively charged and hydrophobic amino acids are the only common elements in the α-actinin binding site of these proteins. The sequence KRKTLMRLLFTHKK in the membrane-proximal region of mouse ADAM12 fits this concept. A second and minor binding site for α-actinin-2 was found in the distal region of the ADAM12 cytoplasmic domain. As we could not identify a precise binding site in this region, it is possible that the site requires a particular conformational structure in this area of the ADAM12 cytoplasmic tail that is not maintained in the fragments of the tail. This second binding site could reinforce or stabilize the interaction of α-actinin-2 with the major binding site. The amino acid sequence of the major binding site for α-actinin-2 is unique to ADAM12 in the superfamily of ADAM proteins, suggesting that the property of binding α-actinin-2 could be specific to ADAM12. However, the predicted structure of this domain is primarily helical and is, in this respect, similar to the corresponding domain of several other ADAMs with long cytoplasmic domains. 2M.-F. Galliano and E. Engvall, unpublished observations. It is therefore possible that other ADAMs might bind α-actinin. Indeed, we observed binding between the ADAM15 (metargidin) cytoplasmic domain and α-actinin-2 in yeast. Although the ADAM15-α-actinin interaction was not examined in detail, this observation suggests that other ADAMs may bind α-actinin and therefore be linked to the cytoskeleton. It further suggests that the binding of ADAM12 to α-actinin is not specific to α-actinin-2, which is muscle-specific; ADAM12 may also bind to other α-actinins. Early evidence for a role for ADAM12 in muscle differentiation was presented by Yagami-Hiromasa et al. (22.Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nature. 1995; 377: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), when they showed that transfection of C2C12 cells with antisense mRNA encoding ADAM12 inhibited cell fusion. The same study showed that overexpression of full-length ADAM12 also inhibited myoblast fusion. In contrast, overexpression of a truncated soluble ADAM12 lacking the metalloprotease domain enhanced fusion, suggesting that the metalloprotease domain negatively regulates cell fusion (22.Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nature. 1995; 377: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). In addition, a truncated and soluble ADAM12 lacking the metalloprotease domain promotes ectopic muscle formation in tumor cells grown in nude mice (23.Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Mattei M.G. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 157-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which ADAM12 controls myoblast fusion is unknown. Our study shows for the first time that an ADAM is linked to the cytoskeleton and provides evidence that this linkage might be necessary for ADAM12 function during myoblast fusion. This study brings new insight to how ADAM12 functions in skeletal muscle cells and suggests that the cytoskeleton may regulate distribution of ADAM12 on the cell surface, thereby exposing its metalloprotease and disintegrin domains in specialized areas of the cell surface, where localized proteolysis and/or cell-cell contacts need to occur. We thank Drs. H. Lecalvez and J. Smith for the mouse ADAM12 plasmid, Dr. A. Beggs for the generous gift of the α-actinin-2 plasmid, and Dr. N. Assa-Munt for help with structure prediction of ADAMs."
https://openalex.org/W2160634299,"Calcium signals lead to the translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. This process is regulated by the calcium-activated phosphatase calcineurin, which can be cotransported with NFAT to the nucleus to maintain it transcriptionally active for the duration of calcium signaling. When the calcium signal ceases, NFAT is exported to the cytoplasm, and different NFAT kinases have been reported to oppose calcineurin activities and regulate the nuclear export of NFAT. Here we show that p38 MAPK phosphorylates in vitro and interactsin vivo with NFATp. Furthermore, the activation of this pathway in HeLa cells by cotransfection with activated MKK6 and p38 counteracts the calcium-induced nuclear accumulation of NFATp but not that of NFATc. By contrast, activation of JNK or ERK pathways failed to modify the nuclear shuttling of NFATp. Consistently, activation of p38, but not the JNK MAPK pathway, results in the inhibition of NFATp-driven transcription. In addition, the inhibition of the nuclear accumulation of NFATp by p38 appears to be mediated through the activation of NFATp nuclear export and takes place in a Leptomycin B-sensitive fashion, suggesting the involvement of the exportin CRM1 in this process. Thus, the p38 signal transduction pathway appears to play an important role in the regulation of the nuclear shuttling of NFATp and in cellular homeostasis.

Upon calcium signaling, the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT proteins leading to the unmasking of the nuclear localization sequences and the translocation of NFATs to the nucleus. NFATs remain in the nucleus while Ca2+ is elevated and are rapidly phosphorylated and exported to the cytoplasm upon termination of calcium signaling or by calcineurin inhibition with cyclosporin A or FK506 (9.Liu J. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 290-295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 10.Timmerman L.A. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Northrop J.P. Crabtree G.R.

Although the role of NFAT proteins in the regulation of the inducible expression of a wide array of genes has been previously established (1.Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of NFAT activation and subcellular localization are not completely understood. Among the signaling pathways identified in mammalian cells, those involving mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been shown to be major mediators in the response to extracellular stimuli through their ability to couple the signal transduction and activation of transcription factors, thus, triggering specific gene expression programs (12.Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar, 13.Su B. Karin M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 14.Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Three major members of MAPKs have been described in mammalian cells: the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the stress-activated protein kinases/JNKs, and the p38/HOG kinases. All MAPKs are highly conserved serine-threonine kinases that are activated through phosphorylation of a TXY motif by upstream MAPK kinases, a family of conserved dual specificity kinases which are, in turn, activated by MAPK kinase kinases. Signals transmitted by membrane receptors are transduced to MAPK kinase kinases through different mediators including kinases, adaptor proteins, and small GTPases (13.Su B. Karin M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar,15.Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar). The specificity of the distinct MAPK cascades in response to a given stimulus is relative and may vary when different cell types are compared. In addition, many stimuli can trigger the parallel activation of different cascades. However, in general terms, ERKs are strongly activated by mitogenic stimuli such as growth factors, whereas the JNK and p38 pathways, although also activated by growth factors, are more efficiently activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and a number of cellular stresses such as UV radiation or hyperosmolarity (17.Cahill M.A. Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 16-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 18.Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Although the implication of signaling cascades mediated by MAPKs in the activation of transcription factors has been extensively analyzed, little is known concerning the signals that counteract such activation. Recently, analysis of the regulation of the nuclear shuttling of members of the NFAT family evidenced the role of kinases in the attenuation of activation signals (19.Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Activation of JNK by overexpression of MKK7 has been shown, for example, to oppose calcium signaling by promoting NFAT4 nuclear exclusion in calcineurin-stimulated BHK cells (20.Chow C.W. Rincón M. Cavanagh J. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 278: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In addition, casein kinase I-α and MEKK1 have been shown to directly and indirectly inhibit NFAT4 nuclear translocation, respectively (21.Zhu J. Shibasaki F. Price R. Guillemot J.C. Yano T. Dotsch V. Wagner G. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Cell. 1998; 93: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and GSK3 has been implicated in the nuclear export of NFAT3 in hippocampal neurons (22.Graef I.A. Mermelstein P.G. Stankunas K. Neilson J.R. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). In T cells, NFATp and NFATc appear to be the major NFAT proteins expressed and regulated during the T cell activation process. NFAT3, on the other hand, has not been detected in the immune system, and NFAT4, whose mRNA levels are elevated in thymus and in nonlymphoid tissues (1.Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar), is found at low levels in resting or activated peripheral blood T cells (23.Lyakh L. Ghosh P. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Whereas the putative kinase that could regulate the nuclear exit of NFATp has not yet been identified, GSK3 has been reported to enhance the nuclear export of NFATc (24.Beals C.R. Sheridan C.M. Turck C.W. Gardner P. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1930-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Recently, a different mechanism involved in the regulation of NFAT4 and NFATc nuclear shuttling has been shown to be mediated by the exportin CRM1 (25.Zhu J. McKeon F. Nature. 1999; 398: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 26.Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), which competes with calcineurin for the binding to the nuclear export sequences of NFAT4 and triggers its nuclear export once calcium signaling ends (25.Zhu J. McKeon F. Nature. 1999; 398: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Activation signals elicited by either cross-linking of the CD3-T cell receptor complex or the combination of phorbol ester plus calcium ionophore result in the activation of the JNK and ERK pathways in T lymphocytes (27.Gómez del Arco P.

Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Recent findings have also shown that p38 is activated by cross-linking of the T cell receptor complex (29.Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Koyasu S. Nishida E. J. Biol.

Similarly, a number of hematopoietic growth factors including interleukin-3, GM-CSF, and CSF-1 are also activators of p38 (34.Foltz I.N. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3296-3301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and the p38 MAPK pathway has been shown to play an important role in the Th1 response where it is required for interferon-γ gene transcription (35.Rincón M. Enslen H. Raingeaud J. Recht M. Zapton T. Su M.S. Penix L.A. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2817-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that p38 MAPK phosphorylatesin vitro and interacts in vivo with NFATp in intact lymphocytes. We also demonstrate that the activation of the p38 signal transduction pathway directly opposes calcineurin signaling by selectively promoting the nuclear export of NFATp, but not that of NFATc, upon calcium signaling. As a result, constitutive activation of the p38 pathway, but not that of the JNK or ERK pathways, leads to the inhibition of NFATp-driven transcription. These findings indicate that p38 MAPK is not only involved in the cellular response to stress (18.Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar) but also in processes related to the deactivation of gene expression programs through the regulation of the subcellular localization of transcription factors. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For immunofluorescence experiments, serum was added at 2 or 5% v/v, as indicated. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were isolated from buffy coats of healthy donors as described previously (36.Martı́nez-Martı́nez S. Gómez del Arco P. Armesilla A.L. Aramburu J. Luo C. Rao A. Redondo J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6437-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and the calcium ionophore A23187 were purchased from Sigma, and sodium chloride and cyclosporin A were purchased from Merck and Sandoz, respectively. The p38 inhibitor SB203580 was synthesized and provided by Dr. Beleta from the Laboratorios Almirall Prodes Farma, S.A. (Barcelona, Spain). Leptomycin B was kindly provided by Dr. M. Yoshida (37.Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). The soluble proteins from 3 × 106 PBLs were separated by electrophoresis in a 12% SDS-polyacrilamide gel polymerized in the presence of 40 μg/ml glutathione S-transferase (GST) or GST fused to the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–415) of human NFATp (GST-NFATp1–415) as indicated. The immune complex kinase assays have been previously described (36.Martı́nez-Martı́nez S. Gómez del Arco P. Armesilla A.L. Aramburu J. Luo C. Rao A. Redondo J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6437-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, p38 from 107 PBLs was immunoprecipitated using a rabbit polyclonal anti-p38 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech, Inc.) (33.Crawley J.B. Rawlinson L. Lali F.V. Page T.H. Saklatvala J. Foxwell B.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15023-15027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μm cold ATP, 1–5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 3 μg of GST-ATF2 or GST-NFATp to the p38 immune complexes. When NFAT was used as a substrate, the major phosphorylated band corresponded to GST-NFATp1–415, as evidenced by trypsin digestion and peptide mass fingerprinting using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight. In-gel kinase assays were then performed for the immunodepletion experiments in which the lysates of 3 × 106 cells were split into two aliquots; one was immunoprecipitated with an excess of p38 antiserum, and the other was used as a control. Both were then run in parallel in the same gel. The activation of endogenous JNK1 by transfected SEK1 in HeLa cells was analyzed by an immune complex kinase assay using 1 μg of GST-c-Jun1–79 as a substrate as described previously (36.Martı́nez-Martı́nez S. Gómez del Arco P. Armesilla A.L. Aramburu J. Luo C. Rao A. Redondo J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6437-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This procedure was obtained from Hibi et al. (40.Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar) and Han et al.(41.Han J. Jiang Y. Li Z. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) with some modifications. 25 × 106 PBLs/condition were lysated in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES at pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 500 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). These cell extracts were modified to make the final composition of the binding buffer (10 mm HEPES at pH 7.6, 250 mmNaCl, 25 mm imidazole, and 0.05% TX-100). The cell extracts were then incubated in binding buffer containing 2% bovine serum albumin on a rocking platform for 6 h to favor specific molecular interactions. After binding, endogenous NFATp was immunoprecipitated overnight with the 1777 antiserum (23.Lyakh L. Ghosh P. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and resolved in 12 (p38) or 8% (JNK1 and ERKs) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted as indicated. The membrane-bound antibodies were visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The activation of p38 by MKK6b(E) in HeLa cells was monitored by Western blot using an anti-phospho p38 antibody that only recognizes the active form of the p38 (New England Biolabs). HeLa cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate procedure with the following plasmids as indicated: 1 μg of the HA-tagged full-length mouse NFATp (HA-NFATp) or 1 μg of the HA-tagged full-length NFATc (HA-NFATc) plus 4 μg of empty vectors, 2 μg of MKK6b(E) (active form) plus 2 μg of flag tagged p38, 1 μg of SEK1, or 2 μg of MEKK1 (active form) plus 2 μg of JNK1. The immunofluorescence assays were performed as described (21.Zhu J. Shibasaki F. Price R. Guillemot J.C. Yano T. Dotsch V. Wagner G. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Cell. 1998; 93: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal 12CA5 anti-HA antibody and the fluorescein isothiocyanate rabbit anti-mouse antibody (DAKO) were used as the primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. The immunofluorescences were examined using a Zeiss microscope. In the transactivation assays, HeLa cells were cotransfected with the NFAT-Luc reporter plasmid (1 μg) and the following constructs as indicated: HA-NFATp expression plasmid (2.5 μg) plus empty vectors (2.5 μg); MKK6b(E) (1.25 μg) plus p38 (1.25 μg); or MEKK1 (1.25 μg) plus JNK1 (1.25 μg). Twenty four hours post-transfection, cells were stimulated with PMA plus A23187 for an additional 5 h. The cells were then lysed, and luciferase activity was measured in a LB 9501 luminometer (Berthold, Wildbad, Germany) as specified in the Luciferase system kit (Promega). The data presented are expressed as the mean and standard deviation of the determinations performed in triplicate. A representative experiment is shown in the reporter assay. Because NFATp is expressed at high levels in T lymphocytes (23.Lyakh L. Ghosh P. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 36.Martı́nez-Martı́nez S. Gómez del Arco P. Armesilla A.L. Aramburu J. Luo C. Rao A. Redondo J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6437-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we used PBLs to analyze potential kinases involved in the regulation of NFATp. To this end, we initially performed in-gel kinase assays using the N-terminal domain of NFATp fused to GST as the substrate and extracts prepared from PBLs activated for different times with the phorbol ester PMA plus the calcium ionophore A23187, a combination of stimuli that promotes the dephosphorylation and nuclear import of NFATp in T cells (23.Lyakh L. Ghosh P. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 36.Martı́nez-Martı́nez S. Gómez del Arco P. Armesilla A.L. Aramburu J. Luo C. Rao A. Redondo J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6437-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These experiments revealed the presence of three different NFATp kinase activities, two of which migrated with the apparent mobilities of JNK1 and -2 (46 and 54 kDa, respectively) that were detected as early as 10 min after activation. The third kinase activity, clearly detected after 150 min of treatment, was the strongest and migrated with the exact mobility of p38 MAPK (Fig.1 A). These kinase activities were not found in the control gels polymerized with GST alone, thus indicating that these kinases had specifically phosphorylated NFATp. Kinetic experiments showed that the 38-kDa NFATp kinase was activated in a sustained fashion in response to PMA plus ionophore or ionophore alone. This was shown by the early detection of 38-kDa activity after 45 min of treatment with PMA plus A23187 and the observed presence of high levels of activity after 150 min of activation (Fig.1 B). Similarly, we observed p38 kinase activity upon treatment of PBLs with ionophore alone at the same time points (Fig.1 B and data not shown). Although some variability was observed in these kinetic experiments depending of the PBL donor, p38 was activated as early as 10–15 min, increased after 45 min, and peaked between 45 and 90 min (Fig. 1, A–C). In-gel experiments using subfractionated cell extracts from PBLs revealed the presence of the 38-kDa NFATp kinase activity in both the cytosolic and nuclear fractions of activated PBLs and evidenced the enrichment of the kinase activity in the nucleus at 60 min (data not shown). This 38-kDa kinase was identified as p38 MAPK by immunodepletion experiments using an anti-p38 MAPK antiserum. In-gel experiments using p38 MAPK immunodepleted extracts showed that the 38-kDa kinase activity was eliminated in lysates from PBLs treated with both PMA plus ionophore or osmotically stressed with NaCl, a major activator of the p38 pathway (Fig. 1 C). Consistently, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 prevented the in vitro phosphorylation of NFATp in in-gel kinase assays performed using lysates from cells treated with PMA plus A23187 or NaCl (data not shown). Moreover, immune complex kinase assays using the anti-p38 MAPK antiserum revealed that recombinant NFATp was an efficient substrate for immunoprecipitated p38 from lysates of PBLs treated with PMA plus ionophore or NaCl (Fig. 1 D). Both the kinetics and strength of p38 activation were similar to those obtained in parallel experiments using ATF-2 (42.Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar) as a substrate, a transcription factor that is phosphorylated and activated by p38 (43.Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). The interaction among kinases and their substrates is often detected in cell lysates. To examine whether NFATp could interact with p38 MAPK in vivo, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation assays using extracts from resting or activated PBLs. Immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis demonstrated the presence of p38 in immunoprecipitates of NFATp even when salt concentrations were high (250 mm NaCl) (Fig.2 A). Because we had previously shown that NFATp is a substrate for JNK in PBLs (36.Martı́nez-Martı́nez S. Gómez del Arco P. Armesilla A.L. Aramburu J. Luo C. Rao A. Redondo J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6437-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and the in-gel kinase experiments had revealed the presence of kinase activities migrating with the mobility of JNKs (Fig. 1 A), we also performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments to investigate whether JNK and NFATp interacted in PBLs. As shown in Fig. 2 B, immunoblot analysis detected the presence of JNK1 in immunoprecipitates of NFATp from resting or activated PBLs. Parallel Western blot analysis using anti-ERK-1 and -2 antibodies, however, failed to detect the presence of ERKs in NFATp immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2 C). To determine whether the phosphorylation of NFATp by p38 and their in vivoassociation play a functional role in the processes of subcellular regulation and transactivation of NFAT, we analyzed by immunofluorescence analysis the effects of overexpression of upstream kinases that regulate MAPKs pathways on the subcellular localization of cotransfected HA-tagged NFATp expression vector. Because of both the difficulty of efficiently cotransfecting lymphocytes with multiple vectors and the endogenous presence of NFATc and NFAT4 (23.Lyakh L. Ghosh P. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) that could interfere in the transactivation analysis of the NFAT-driven reporter plasmid, we performed the experiments in HeLa cells, a cell line in which NFAT members can be efficiently transfected and NFATp has previously been shown to shuttle upon calcineurin stimulation (44.Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. López-Rodríguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Rakeman A.S. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 45.Aramburu J. Garcı́a-Cozar F. Raghavan A. Okamura H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, transfected recombinant HA-tagged NFATp was expressed in the cytoplasm of control cells and translocated to the nucleus upon activation with calcium ionophore A23187. The translocation of NFATp to the nucleus was evidenced 30 min post-activation, peaked after 60–90 min of treatment, and maintained for at least 3 h (Fig. 3 and data not shown). As previously noted for other cell types (46.Enslen H. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1741-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 47.Jiang Y.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17920-17926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), the transfection of activated MKK6 alone failed to efficiently activate the endogenous p38 MAPK in HeLa cells as determined by Western blot experiments using extracts of transfected cells and an anti-phospho-p38 antibody (Fig.3 B, inset, and data not shown). Therefore, we cotransfected the constitutively active MKK6 (MKK6b(E)) and p38 expression vectors to activate the p38 MAPK pathway and analyzed by immunofluorescence the shuttling of transfected recombinant HA-NFATp in HeLa cells treated with calcium ionophore. The transfection of these kinases resulted in almost complete inhibition of the nuclear localization of cotransfected HA-NFATp at all times analyzed. This inhibition was reverted by treatment with SB203580 indicating, therefore, that the nuclear exclusion of the transcription factor was because of the activation of p38 MAPK (Fig. 3). In contrast, activation of the JNK pathway by overexpression of SEK1 failed to modify the nuclear localization of NFATp and the transcription factor accumulated in the nucleus as in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 3, A andC). Similarly, activation of the JNK pathway by cotransfection of JNK1 and constitutively active MEKK1 did not affect the nuclear localization of NFATp in resting or ionophore-treated cells. In these experiments, NFATp displayed 100% cytoplasmic localization in resting cells and 94% nuclear localization in ionophore-treated cells. Likewise, in 89% of cells cotransfected with JNK1 and activated MEKK1, NFATp was located in the nucleus. The efficient activation of JNK1 and p38 MAPKs in the transfected cells was confirmed by control assays using extracts from the transfected cells used in the immunofluorescence analysis. p38 MAPK activation was evidenced by immunoblot assay using an anti-phospho-p38 antibody (Fig.3 B, inset), and JNK1 activity was monitored with an immu"
https://openalex.org/W2068432279,"RGS proteins comprise a family of proteins named for their ability to negatively regulate heterotrimeric G protein signaling. Biochemical studies suggest that members of this protein family act as GTPase-activating proteins for certain Gα subunits, thereby accelerating the turn-off mechanism of Gα and terminating signaling by both Gα and Gβγ subunits. In the present study, we used confocal microscopy to examine the intracellular distribution of several RGS proteins in COS-7 cells expressing RGS-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins and in cells expressing RGS proteins endogenously. RGS2 and RGS10 accumulated in the nucleus of COS-7 cells transfected with GFP constructs of these proteins. In contrast, RGS4 and RGS16 accumulated in the cytoplasm of COS-7 transfectants. As observed in COS-7 cells, RGS4 exhibited cytoplasmic localization in mouse neuroblastoma cells, and RGS10 exhibited nuclear localization in human glioma cells. Deletion or alanine substitution of an N-terminal leucine repeat motif present in both RGS4 and RGS16, a domain identified as a nuclear export sequence in HIV Rev and other proteins, promoted nuclear localization of these proteins in COS-7 cells. In agreement with this observation, treatment of mouse neuroblastoma cells with leptomycin B to inhibit nuclear protein export by exportin1 resulted in accumulation of RGS4 in the nucleus of these cells. GFP fusions of RGS domains of RGS proteins localized in the nucleus, suggesting that nuclear localization of RGS proteins results from nuclear targeting via RGS domain sequences. RGSZ, which shares with RGS-GAIP a cysteine-rich string in its N-terminal region, localized to the Golgi complex in COS-7 cells. Deletion of the N-terminal domain of RGSZ that includes the cysteine motif promoted nuclear localization of RGSZ. None of the RGS proteins examined were localized at the plasma membrane. These results demonstrate that RGS proteins localize in the nucleus, the cytoplasm, or shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm as nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttle proteins. RGS proteins localize differentially within cells as a result of structural differences among these proteins that do not appear to be important determinants for their G protein-regulating activities. These findings suggest involvement of RGS proteins in more complex cellular functions than currently envisioned.

Subsequent studies have documented the existence of transcripts encoding proteins with RGS domains, a semi-conserved sequence of approximately 120 amino acids found in all RGS proteins, in species ranging from fungus to man (1Dohlman H.G.

RGS proteins bind to Gα subunits in the Gi and Gqfamilies in vitro and dramatically enhance their intrinsic GTPase activity (6Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G.

Stimulation of GTP hydrolysis of Gα subunits leads to their conversion from the active Gα-GTP form to the inactive Gα-GDP form and their recombination with Gβγ subunits, effectively terminating signaling by both Gα and Gβγ subunits. The deduced crystal structure of RGS4 bound to Giα1 showed interaction of RGS domain residues with the G protein switch regions, suggesting that the mechanism of GTPase acceleration by RGS proteins may be due primarily to stabilization of the transition state of Gα residues directly involved in catalysis (8Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Additional studies have raised the possibility that RGS proteins may also interact with effectors or receptors to attenuate G protein signaling. These studies reported that recombinant RGS proteins can block PI PLC activation by Gqα-GTPγS in vitro (9Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and produce receptor-selective attenuation of Gq signaling when added to permeabilized cells (10Xu X. Zeng W. Popov S. Berman D.M.

Here we examined the cellular localization of RGS proteins expressed as GFP fusion proteins in COS-7 cells or endogenously in other cells. Our results reveal a surprising diversity in subcellular localization and trafficking of RGS proteins. RGS proteins localize in the nucleus, the cytoplasm or shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm as nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttle proteins. None of the RGS proteins studied showed localization at the plasma membrane. We identified the molecular determinant for nuclear localization of RGS proteins to the conserved RGS domain present in all RGS proteins. We also identified sequence elements outside of the RGS domain that result in either nuclear-cytoplasmic transport or cytoplasmic retention of RGS proteins. These results show that RGS proteins localize differentially within cells as a result of structural differences among these proteins that do not appear to be important determinants for their G protein-regulating activities. This study is the first to investigate sequences responsible for and mechanisms underlying localization of RGS proteins within mammalian cells. Our findings suggest involvement of RGS proteins in more complex cellular functions than currently envisioned.DISCUSSIONThese results have elucidated an unexpected diversity in subcellular localization and trafficking of RGS proteins in mammalian cells.

We identified the molecular determinant for nuclear localization of RGS proteins to the conserved RGS domain present in all RGS proteins. We also identified sequence elements outside of the RGS domain that result in either nuclear-cytoplasmic transport or cytoplasmic retention of RGS proteins. A Rev-like sequence in the N termini of RGS4 and RGS16 was identified and shown to mediate nuclear-cytoplasmic export of these proteins by interactions with the exportin1-RanGTP complex. Our results suggest that cytoplasmic retention of some RGS proteins may be mediated by other types of sequences located in their N-terminal domains. Cytoplasmic retention and localization of RGSZ within the trans-Golgi network is mediated by sequences in its N-terminal domain, which shares a cysteine-rich motif found in the N terminus of RGS-GAIP, another trans-Golgi RGS protein. None of the RGS proteins we studied showed appreciable accumulation at the plasma membrane.RGS proteins are named for their ability to negatively regulate signaling by G proteins, located at the plasma membrane and, for some G proteins, in the Golgi complex (23Druey K.M.

(10Xu X. Zeng W. Popov S. Berman D.M. Davignon I., Yu, K. Yowe D. Offermanns S. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol.

The differential inhibitory effects of the same or different RGS protein on receptor-mediated Gq signaling were not due to differences in the type of Gq activated or the extent of Gq activation. These observations suggested that RGS proteins interact directly with receptors to modulate G protein-coupled receptor signaling. Zenget al. (34Zeng W. Xu X. Popov S. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Swistok J. Danho W. Yagaloff K.A. Fisher S.L. Ross E.M. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34687-34690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) reported that the N terminus of RGS4 was responsible for receptor-selective inhibition of Gq in pancreatic acinar cells dialyzed with recombinant RGS4 or portions thereof. Interestingly, the N-terminal 33 amino acids of RGS4 produced inhibitory effects on receptor-mediated Gq signaling that were synergistic with that of the RGS domain of RGS4 and that were not reversed by GTPγS. Thus, the N-terminal domain of RGS4 was suggested to interact with receptors to position the protein between Gq and the effector PI PLCβ. In such a position, RGS4 could impart receptor-selective inhibition of Gqactivation, act as a Gq GTPase-activating protein, and act as an effector antagonist toward PI PLCβ. Evidence for this latter concept was provided first by the observation that recombinant RGS4 and RGS-GAIP blocked activation of PI PLC by GTPγS or GTPγS plus bradykinin in NG-108 membranes (9Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). These workers also showed that PI PLCβ inhibited binding of Gqα to RGS4, suggesting that RGS4 may compete with Gq for binding to PI PLC to mediate effector antagonism. RGS4 had no effects on receptor-mediated nucleotide exchange.Implicit in the proposed regulatory actions of RGS proteins on cell surface receptors, Gα subunits or the effector PI PLC is their localization at or near the plasma membrane. However, our finding that certain RGS proteins (RGS2 and RGS10) are localized predominantly in the nucleus suggest that their interaction with plasma membrane-bound receptors, G proteins, or effectors is unlikely in intact resting cells. This, of course, does not preclude their interaction with such signaling proteins when added as recombinant proteins in vitro or to permeabilized or dialyzed cells as well as under certain cellular situations that are not as yet defined. Our results show that other RGS proteins (RGS4 and RGS16) are found predominantly in the cytoplasm where it seems more likely that they could interact with signaling proteins at the plasma membrane. We did not observe recruitment of RGS4 or RGS16 to the plasma membrane of COS-7 cells following stimulation of endogenous Gi-coupled lysophosphatidic acid receptors in these cells. Druey et al.(35Druey K.M. Sullivan B.M. Brown D. Fischer E.R. Watson N. Blumer K.J. Gerfen C.R. Scheschonka A. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol.

The mechanism of this recruitment does not involve interaction of RGS4 with mutant Giα because similar recruitment was observed with an RGS4 mutant that does not interact with Giα, and previous studies have shown that RGS4 does not complex with GTPase-deficient Giα1 (7Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Dulin et al. (31Dulin N.O. Sorokin A. Reed E. Elliott S. Kehrl J.H. Dunn M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 714-723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported the presence of RGS3 immunoreactivity in endothelin- or A23187-induced membrane ruffles in HMG/RGS3 cells, although most RGS3 remained in the cytoplasm. Whether RGS3 localization in membrane ruffles is unique to these mesangial cell transfectants and/or important in the regulatory effects of RGS3 in these cells is unknown. However, it is known that expression of RGS4 in several mammalian cells including COS-7 cells attenuates receptor-mediated activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase via Gi and Gq(13Chatterjee T.K. Eapen A.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15481-15487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 23Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11924-11927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A key question that remains unanswered is whether these actions of RGS4 and other cytoplasmic RGS proteins requires their translocation and physical association with the plasma membrane.Two recent papers support our evidence that some members of the RGS protein family are localized in the Golgi complex and nucleus. De Vrieset al. (20De Vries L. Elenko E. McCaffery M. Fischer T. Hubler L. McQuistan T. Watson N. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1123-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) showed that RGS-GAIP is located on Golgi membranes and not the plasma membrane. Our results show that RGSZ is localized exclusively in the trans-Golgi complex and that this localization is dependent upon sequences in its N-terminal domain, a region that shares with RGS-GAIP 8 cysteines in an 11-amino acid stretch. Because RGSZ shares no homology with RGS-GAIP in this region apart from this cysteine string, we favor the idea that this motif is important in the cytoplasmic retention and targeting of these two RGS proteins to the Golgi complex. In addition, Bowman et al.(36Bowman E.P. Campbell J.J. Druey K.M. Scheschonka A. Kehrl J.H. Butcher E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28040-28048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) showed confocal images of L1/2 lymphoid cells transfected with GFP fusions of RGS1, RGS2, and RGS3. Although nuclear staining was not shown, the authors suggested that RGS2 was present in a region identified as the nucleus as well as near the plasma membrane. RGS1 was found throughout the cell with equivalent intensity, similar to the pattern of GFP alone, whereas RGS3 seemed to be excluded from the presumed nuclear region. Although these findings are not entirely consistent with our documentation of nuclear localization of RGS2, they support our evidence that some RGS proteins are transported to and remain in the nucleus after synthesis by virtue of their lack of cytoplasmic retention or nuclear export sequences.The experiments described here do not address whether RGS proteins have functions apart from their ability to regulate membrane-delimited events involved in G protein signaling. It is possible that they have only G protein regulatory functions. In such a case, the separation in space of G proteins at the plasma membrane and RGS proteins at other cellular sites may be of regulatory importance, with these two families of proteins interacting only under certain cellular conditions. Alternatively, it is possible that RGS proteins have functions apart from, or in addition to, their ability to negatively regulate G protein signaling. In view of our evidence for nuclear localization and nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of some RGS proteins, it is interesting to speculate that these proteins may possess currently unrecognized functions in nuclear processes. We are unaware of such evidence, although Chuang et al. (37Chuang H-H., Yu, M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11727-11732Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) suggested that RGS4 expression in oocytes caused a larger population of G proteins to be accessible for receptor-mediated GIRK channel activation. Although it has been shown that stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors can induce expression of RGS proteins (23Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 28Tseng C.-C. Zhang X.-Y. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4470-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), it is unclear whether RGS protein expression can similarly influence expression of G proteins or other proteins. Of interest is our finding that RGS domains of RGS proteins possess, in addition to determinants required for interaction with Gα proteins, sequences that target these proteins to the cell nucleus. Thus, it seems appropriate to speculate that both conserved and divergent sequences of RGS proteins may encode functions apart from the G protein-binding and -regulating activities of these proteins.The existence of a large family of RGS proteins immediately prompted questions regarding functional differences among members of this family. Among many possibilities was the notion that sequence differences among these proteins may be involved in determining their specificity(s) toward G proteins. However, most studies have shown that RGS proteins are GTPase-activating proteins for G proteins in the Gi and Gq family, despite considerable sequence diversity outside of their conserved RGS domains. Thus, the RGS domain may represent the primary determinant for RGS protein interactions with G proteins, a finding supported by the deduced crystal structure of RGS4-Giα1 and in vitro studies (8Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar,12Brott B.K. Pinsky B.A. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1529-1533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Here, we provide evidence that diversity within this protein family has consequences in terms of the localization of RGS proteins within cells. The present study is the first to investigate the sequences responsible for and mechanisms underlying localization of these proteins within mammalian cells. Our results show that RGS proteins localize differentially within cells as a result of structural differences among these proteins that do not appear to be important determinants for their G protein-regulating activities. It seems quite likely that RGS proteins may have different functions within cells as a result of these different localization patterns. Hopefully, the present results will facilitate identification of new activities of the proteins that comprise the RGS protein family. RGS proteins comprise a family of more than 20 known members that have been implicated in the negative regulation of heterotrimeric G protein1 signaling (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J. Biol.

The deduced crystal structure of RGS4 bound to Giα1 showed interaction of RGS domain residues with the G protein switch regions, suggesting that the mechanism of GTPase acceleration by RGS proteins may be due primarily to stabilization of the transition state of Gα residues directly involved in catalysis (8Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Additional studies have raised the possibility that RGS proteins may also interact with effectors or receptors to attenuate G protein signaling. These studies reported that recombinant RGS proteins can block PI PLC activation by Gqα-GTPγS in vitro (9Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl."

Gab1 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells stimulated with growth factors, cytokines, and ligands for G protein-coupled receptors. A major Gab1-binding protein detected in cells treated with extracellular stimuli is the tyrosine phosphatase, SHP2. Although the role of SHP2-Gab1 interaction in cell signaling has not yet been characterized, SHP2 is known to mediate mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation induced by the epidermal growth factor (EGF). However, the mechanism by which the SHP2 phosphatase exerts a positive signaling role remains obscure. In this study, we prepared Gab1 mutants lacking the SHP2 binding site (Gab1Y627F), the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) binding sites (Gab1ΔPI3K), and the PH domain (Gab1ΔPH). Expression of Gab1Y627F blocked the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2 (ERK2) activation by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and EGF. Conversely, expression of the wild-type Gab1 in HEK293 cells augmented the LPA receptor Edg2-mediated ERK2 activation. Whereas the PH domain was required for Gab1 mediation of ERK2 activation by LPA, it was not essential for EGF-induced ERK2 activation. Expression of Gab1ΔPI3K had no apparent effect on ERK2 activation by LPA and EGF in the cells that we have examined. These results establish a role for Gab1 in the LPA-induced MAP kinase pathway and clearly demonstrate that Gab1-SHP2 interaction is essential for ERK2 activation by LPA and EGF. These findings also suggest that the positive role of SHP2 in the MAP kinase pathway depends on its interaction with Gab1.

Besides modulating the activities of substrate proteins, a common role of protein tyrosine phosphorylation is to create binding sites for the assembly of specific protein complexes (1.Pawson T.

The formation of specific protein complexes mediates cell signaling by targeting enzymes to substrates or by altering enzymatic activities through protein-protein interactions. Gab11 is a multisite docking protein that contains 694 amino acids and migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 115 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (1.Pawson T. Gish G.D.

Gab1 is structurally similar to the Drosophila daughter of sevenless protein and to the insulin receptor substrate family of multisite docking proteins with an amino-terminal PH domain, several proline-rich sequences, and multiple potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Gab1 is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon stimulation of cells with EGF, insulin, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), nerve growth factor, interleukin-6, and erythropoietin (2.Holgado-Madruga M.

Other signaling molecules such as the adapter protein Grb2, PI3K, and phospholipase Cγ have also been found to associate with Gab1 in various cell lines (2.Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R.

Gramaglia D. Stella M. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 3103-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), but the role of Grb2-Gab1 interaction in EGF and cytokine signaling remains to be determined. Binding of PI3K to Gab1 has been reported to be involved in the regulation of cell survival by nerve growth factor in PC12 cells (4.Holgado-Madruga M. Moscatello D.K. Emlet D.R. Dieterich E. Wong A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12419-12424Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). It is unclear, however, whether binding of PI3K to Gab1 is involved in the MAP kinase pathway. Tyr-627 in the carboxyl-terminal region of Gab1 has been identified as the SHP2 binding site in insulin-stimulated cells (13.Rocchi S. Tartare-Deckert S. Murdaca J. Holgado-Madruga M. Wong A.J. van Obberghen E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 914-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Tyrosine residues 447, 472, and 589 in Gab1 are located in a YVPM sequence motif that is selectively recognized by the 85-kDa subunit of PI3Kα (14.Zhou S. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T.

Recently, it was reported that the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylates eight tyrosine residues of Gab1 in vitro (Fig. 1), including the three PI3K binding sites and the SHP2 binding site identified previously (15.Lehr S. Kotzka J. Herkner A. Klein E. Siethoff C. Knebel B. Noelle V. Bruning J.C. Klein H.W. Meyer H.E. Krone W. Muller-Wieland D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Gab1 contains an amino-terminal PH domain (16.Gibson T.J. Hyvonen M. Musacchio A. Saraste M. Birney E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 349-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that some PH domains can bind various phosphoinositides and Gβγ (16.Gibson T.J. Hyvonen M.

A recent study has suggested that the Gab1-PH domain contains the consensus sequence motif for binding to PI3K products (18.Isakoff S.J. Cardozo T. Andreev J. Li Z. Ferguson K.M. Abagyan R. Lemmon M.A. Aronheim A. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5374-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In confluent Madin-Darby canine kidney cells grown in high serum concentrations, Gab1 is located predominantly at sites of cell-cell contact in a PH- and PI3K-dependent manner (19.Moroun C.R.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1784-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), suggesting that the PH domain may bind membrane 3-phosphoinositides and target Gab1 to the vicinity of the plasma membrane. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a mitogenic phospholipid that induces an array of cellular responses, including activation of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway, by binding to G protein-coupled receptors (20.Moolenaar W.H.

Recently, Edg2 and Edg4, two G protein-coupled receptors with different tissue distribution patterns, have been identified as LPA receptors (20.Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. Postma F.R. Zondag G.C.M.

Preincubation of cells with specific inhibitors of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase or expression of a truncated EGF receptor blocked LPA-induced EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the ERK subfamily of the MAP kinases (28.Daub H.

However, LPA only weakly increases EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and activates signaling mechanisms that are not EGF receptor-dependent, whereas EGF markedly activates EGF receptor tyrosine kinase and other members of ErbB tyrosine kinases. Thus, many differences in LPA and EGF signaling are likely to exist. This laboratory and others (32.Kranenburg O. Verlaan I. Hordijk P.L. Moolenaar W.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3097-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) observed an approximately 115-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in LPA-stimulated cells. The protein was later identified as Gab1 (29.Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). However, the role of Gab1 in the signal transduction of LPA or other ligands of G protein-coupled receptors has not been established. To investigate the role of Gab1 in the LPA- and EGF-induced MAP kinase signaling pathways, we prepared Gab1 mutants that lack the SHP2 binding site, the PI3K binding sites, and the PH domain and analyzed the effects of expression of these Gab1 constructs on LPA- and EGF-induced ERK2 activation. We report here that Gab1-SHP2 interaction is necessary for ERK2 activation in response to LPA and EGF. Furthermore, the PH domain is required for Gab1 to mediate LPA-induced ERK2 activation. These findings establish the role of Gab1 in the LPA-induced MAP kinase pathway and suggest that the positive regulatory role of SHP2 in MAP kinase activation relies on its interaction with Gab1.

Toshio Hirano and Masahiko Hibi (Osaka University). Gab1 cDNA from this plasmid was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 by polymerase chain reaction using Pfu DNA polymerase to generate a carboxyl-terminal FLAG (Sigma)-tagged expression plasmid for Gab1 (pGab1FL). The Gab1 DNA sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Site-specific mutagenesis of Gab1 was performed with the GeneEditorin vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega). The mutagenic primer, 5′-pCAGGTGGAATTCTTAGATCTCGAC (the changed nucleotide is underlined) was used for replacing the Tyr-627 with phenylalanine in the mutation of the SHP2 binding site (pGab1Y627F). Three oligonucleotides (5′-pCTGGATGAGAATTTCGTCCCAATGAATC, 5′-pCAATTCAGGAAGCGAATTTTGTGCCAATGACTC, and 5′-pGTGAAGAGAATTTTGTTCCCATGAACC) were used simultaneously to produce the triple Y447F/Y472F/Y589F mutations of the Gab1 PI3K binding sites (pGab1ΔPI3K). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To generate the PH domain deletion mutant of Gab1, the DNA sequence between the AccIII and BamHI sites of Gab1 cDNA in pGab1FL was deleted, and a double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-pCCGGAGCTAGCATCGATGAG and 5′-pGATCCTCATCGATGCTAGCT) was inserted between the AccIII and BamHI sites. This plasmid (pGab1ΔPH) lacks the coding sequence for amino acids 10–177. These Gab1 constructs are shown schematically in Fig. 1. An example of expression of these constructs in HEK293 cells is also illustrated in Fig. 1, bottom panel. cDNA was prepared from 10 μg of total RNA prepared from mouse fibroblasts by reverse transcription with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse trancriptase, using random hexamers as primers. A full-length Edg2 cDNA was then isolated from this cDNA preparation by polymerase chain reaction using Pfu DNA polymerase and primers (5′-GCGGATCCATGGCWGCYRYCTCTACTT (where is A + T, R is A + G, and Y is C + T) and 5′-GCTGAATTCTAAACCACAGAGTG), based on the published sequences of mouse and human Edg2 cDNA (24.Hecht J.H.

Weiner J.A. Post S.R. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) except for two nucleotide changes introduced by the degenerate primer, which does not change the identity of the encoded amino acids. The cDNA was subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1 to generate pEdg2. COS-7 and HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were seeded in 60-mm plates 24 h before transfection to yield a 50% confluent culture on the day of transfection. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine, according to the supplier's instructions. Briefly, cells were incubated with DNA-Lipofectamine (2 μg total/12 μl) complexes in serum-free medium for 5–7 h. The DNA complexes were then removed from the medium, and the cells were incubated with complete growth medium. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were starved overnight in serum-free medium and then used for experiments. For analysis of Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation and complex formation with SHP2, cells were lysed in buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaF, 1 mmbenzamidine, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmNa3VO4, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Endogenous Gab1 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-Gab1 polyclonal antibody. FLAG-tagged mutant or wild-type Gab1 was immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, M2. Collected immune complexes were resolved on 8.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and processed for immunoblotting analysis essentially as described previously (30.Cunnick J.M. Dorsey J.F. Standley T. Turkson J. Kraker A.J. Fry D.W. Jove R. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14468-14475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transfected with pGab1FL or pGab1ΔPI3K, serum-starved, and then stimulated with EGF or mock-treated. Cells were lysed in buffer A. Gab1FL and Gab1ΔPI3K were immunoprecipitated with antibody M2 and protein G-agarose. For control experiments, PI3K was immunoprecipitated with an anti-PI3K (p85) antibody. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with buffer A, twice with buffer B (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mmLiCl, 0.5 mm Na3VO4), and once with buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmNa3VO4). The immunoprecipitates were then incubated with 50 μl of 0.2 mg/ml PtdIns suspended in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol) for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with 100 μl of 1 m HCl and immediately extracted with 200 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). The lipid products were dried under nitrogen gas, redissolved in chloroform, and spotted onto TLC plates, which had been coated with oxalate to prevent streaking. The plates were developed in chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide/water (45:35:3.3:6.7, v/v/v/v). The radioactivity on the plates was visualized by autoradiography. PtdIns-4-P, which migrates slightly faster than PtdIns-3-P (36.Witman M. Downes C.P. Keeler M. Keller T. Cantley L. Nature. 1988; 332: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar), was used as a marker and was visualized by staining with iodine vapor. Cells were lysed in buffer A, and HA-ERK2 was immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal antibody, HA.11. Half of each lysate was used to determine ERK2 activity, while the other half was analyzed for ERK2 protein. For the kinase assay, immune complexes were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in 40 μl of MAP kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 40 μm ATP, and 0.375 mg/ml myelin basic protein) containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). The reaction was terminated with SDS-containing gel-loading buffer, and the reaction mixtures were resolved on 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were processed by autoradiography. For quantification, the gels were analyzed with a PhosphorImager. Analysis of ERK2 protein in the immunoprecipitates was achieved by immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody to ERK2. During our previous studies, we observed a 115-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in cells stimulated with LPA and EGF. To determine whether this protein was Gab1, serum-starved COS-7 cells were treated with LPA, EGF, or BSA (mock). Gab1 was then immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and the immunoprecipitates were resolved on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 and association of SHP2 with Gab1 were analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody RC20 and an anti-SHP2 antibody, respectively. Fig.2 A shows that LPA and EGF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 correlated with binding of SHP2 to Gab1 (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, LPA-induced Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation required the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity (data not shown), confirming a previous report (29.Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Similar results were also obtained in HEK293 cells, HeLa cells, and HaCaT cells (data not shown). Tyr-627 of Gab1 has been identified as the SHP2 binding site in insulin-stimulated cells (13.Rocchi S. Tartare-Deckert S. Murdaca J. Holgado-Madruga M. Wong A.J. van Obberghen E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 914-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A recentin vitro study demonstrated that Tyr-627 is the major tyrosine residue in Gab1 that is phosphorylated by the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase (15.Lehr S. Kotzka J. Herkner A. Klein E. Siethoff C. Knebel B. Noelle V. Bruning J.C. Klein H.W. Meyer H.E. Krone W. Muller-Wieland D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of Gab1-SHP2 interaction in LPA and EGF signaling, a Tyr-627 to phenylalanine mutation of Gab1 (Gab1Y627F) was prepared. Gab1FL and Gab1Y627F were then co-expressed with SHP2 in COS-7 cells to determine whether Gab1Y627F loses SHP2 binding activity. A basal SHP2 reactivity was detected in serum-starved cells with no difference between Gab1FL and Gab1Y627F. Stimulation of cells with LPA resulted in a small increase in the amount of SHP2 associated with Gab1FL, whereas EGF stimulation markedly increased the amount of SHP2 associated with Gab1FL. Importantly, mutation of Tyr-627 in Gab1 completely eliminated the increase in the binding of SHP2 in cells stimulated with LPA or EGF (Fig.3 A). These results substantiate Tyr-627 as the LPA- and EGF-induced SHP2 binding site in Gab1. The result shown in Fig. 7 (see below) also demonstrates that Gab1Y627F loses the LPA-induced SHP2 binding activity in HEK293 cells.Figure 7LPA induces SHP2 binding to Gab1FL but not to Gab1Y627F in HEK293 cells co-expressing Edg2. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with 1.5 μg of pEdg2 and 0.5 μg of pGab1FL or pGab1Y627F. After serum starvation, cells were treated for 4 min with LPA (25 μm) or BSA. Gab1FL and Gab1Y627F were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-SHP2 antibody (A) or an anti-Gab1 antibody (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next analyzed the effect of the Y627F mutation on ERK2 activation in response to LPA and EGF.

To study this process we used calmodulin (CaM) as a substrate because of its importance in cell regulation and because it acquires isoaspartyl residues in its Ca2+-binding regions bothin vivo and after in vitro “aging” (incubation for 2 weeks without Ca2+). When microinjected into Xenopus oocytes, in vitro aged CaM was degraded much faster than native CaM by a proteasome-dependent process. Similarly, in HeLa cell extracts aged CaM was degraded at a higher rate, even though it was not conjugated to ubiquitin more rapidly than the native species. Ca2+ stimulated the ubiquitination of both species, but inhibited their degradation. Thus, for CaM, ubiquitination and proteolysis appear to be dissociated. Accordingly, purified muscle 26 S proteasomes could degrade aged CaM and native Ca2+-free (apo) CaM without ubiquitination. Addition of Ca2+dramatically reduced degradation of the native molecules but only slightly reduced the breakdown of the aged species. Thus, upon Ca2+ binding, native CaM assumes a non-degradable conformation, which most of the age-damaged species cannot assume. Thus, flexible conformations, as may arise from age-induced damage or the absence of ligands, can promote degradation directly by the proteasome without ubiquitination.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). Although proteins can undergo various types of chemical modifications with time, the intracellular fate of such damaged proteins has not been systematically studied. We chose to use CaM to investigate this process, because it plays an important role in cell regulation (3.Vogel H.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 357-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), therefore factors influencing its function and degradation can have important physiological consequences. Moreover, its tertiary structure is known in detail (4.Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar,5.Zhang M. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar) and spontaneous chemical modifications that occur in CaM upon aging (6.Ota I.M. Clarke S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4020-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 7.Ota I.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 279: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have been shown to promote its degradation (8.Szymanska G. Leszyk J.D. O'Connor C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28516-28523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). CaM has been reported to have a half-life of 18–25 h (1–2%/h) (9.Ferrington D.A. Chen X. Krainev A.G. Michaelis E.K. Bigelow D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 163-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar,10.Chafouleas J.G. Pardue R.L. Brinkley B.R. Dedman J.R. Means A.R. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 1985; 260: 3344-3349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Over time, such long-lived proteins are susceptible to a variety of spontaneous chemical modifications, including the deamidation of asparaginyl residues and the isomerization of aspartyl residues (7.Ota I.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 279: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar,12.Potter S.M. Henzel W.J. Aswad D.W. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1648-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These modifications arise through slow, non-enzymatic rearrangements that yield isoaspartyl residues and also some racemized aspartyl residues (13.Geiger T. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The appearance of these residues has been detected by enzymatic carboxyl methylation using protein-l-isoaspartate (d-aspartate)O-methyltransferase (14.O'Connor C.M. Aswad D.W. Clarke S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7757-7761Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and has been demonstrated to occur in several proteins in vivo as well as in vitroupon prolonged incubation at physiological pH and temperatures (15.Najbauer J. Orpiszewski J. Aswad D.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5183-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar,16.Paranandi M.V. Guzzetta A.W. Hancock W.S. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When CaM was incubated for 2 weeks at pH 7.4 and 37 °C in the presence of Ca2+, small amounts of isoaspartyl residues were formed only from two aspartates at flexible regions of CaM, which do not participate in Ca2+ binding (6.Ota I.M. Clarke S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4020-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Isoaspartates were found at these same positions in CaM isolated from bovine brain (17.Ota I.M. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 54-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When Ca2+ was not present during the 2-week incubation, there was a dramatic increase in the isoaspartyl content of CaM, due to the deamidation of several asparaginyl residues and the isomerization of additional aspartates (6.Ota I.M. Clarke S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4020-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12.Potter S.M. Henzel W.J. Aswad D.W. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1648-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because these isoaspartates were in positions implicated in Ca2+ binding, their appearance correlated with a significant loss of Ca2+-dependent regulatory activity (18.Johnson B.A. Langmack E.L. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12283-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in CaM isolated from human erythrocytes, the principal sites of isoaspartyl residues were also in these Ca2+-binding regions (7.Ota I.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 279: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, preincubation of CaM in the absence of Ca2+ may serve as an in vitro model for protein “aging” in intact cells (12.Potter S.M. Henzel W.J. Aswad D.W. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1648-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Age-induced chemical modifications, damage by oxygen-free radicals and other post-translational damage are believed to trigger rapid degradation of proteins in vivo (19.Stadtman E.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6323-6331Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we demonstrated that in vitro aged (deamidated) CaM was rapidly degraded following microinjection into Xenopusoocytes (8.Szymanska G. Leszyk J.D. O'Connor C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28516-28523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). By contrast recently isolated CaM, as well as CaM preincubated for 2 weeks in the presence of Ca2+, were stable for several hours. In the present studies we sought to uncover the molecular basis for the differential degradation of age-damaged CaM and to define the role of the Ub-proteasome pathway in this process. In the Ub-proteasome pathway, regulatory proteins or proteins with abnormal conformation are marked for rapid degradation by a series of enzymatic reactions leading to the attachment of a chain of ubiquitin molecules to lysine residues on the substrate (2.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). These Ub-conjugated proteins are then digested rapidly to small peptides by the 26 S proteasome, a 2.4-MDa complex containing multiple proteolytic sites within its 20 S core particle (20.Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar, 21.Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). Recognition of short-lived regulatory proteins by the ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3s) can depend on the presence of particular sequences (e.g. the destruction box of mitotic cyclins or substrate phosphorylation) (2.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar), but the mode of recognition of substrates with abnormal conformations is unknown. It has been suggested that the appearance of modified amino acids leads directly to the proteins recognition and rapid degradation (19.Stadtman E.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6323-6331Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Alternatively, these modified residues may have an indirect effect by disrupting the proteins normal conformation, thus leading to its selective degradation. It is assumed that the Ub-protein ligases (E3s) are the recognition elements, or that ubiquitination of abnormal proteins may follow their selective binding to molecular chaperones (22.Lee D.H. Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4773-4781Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although Ub conjugation is essential for the rapid elimination of many regulatory and mutant polypeptides (2.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar, 23.Ciechanover A. Finley D. Varshavsky A.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6716-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). While ubiquitination of proteins generally enhances their breakdown (30.Pickart C.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 31.Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar), in vitro certain unfolded proteins and the short lived enzyme, ornithine decarboxylase, can be hydrolyzed by proteasomes rapidly in an ATP-dependent manner in the absence of ubiquitination (27.Murakami Y.

In this study we have used oocytes, HeLa cell lysates, and purified 26 S proteasomes to explore the biochemical mechanisms leading to the rapid destruction of the in vitro aged CaM. We demonstrate here that aged CaM and the apo-form of native CaM are degraded rapidly by 26 S proteasomes, apparently without ubiquitination. Interestingly, upon Ca2+ binding, native CaM assumes a conformation that prevents its degradation by the proteasome, even though Ca2+ binding promotes CaM ubiquitination. Furthermore, the chemical modifications that occur during aging, which make CaM less able to bind Ca2+, lead to its rapid degradation directly by the proteasomes, even in the presence of Ca2+. Recombinant chicken hemagglutinin-tagged CaM (HA-CaM) and metabolically labeled CaM ([35S]CaM) were purified from P4830 Escherichia coli cells that had been transformed with the pCaMpLplasmid containing the chicken CaM gene under the control of the λ phage left promoter. The P4830 host E. coli (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) contains a temperature-sensitive variant of the cI repressor. For HA-CaM purification the E. coli cells were grown in LB medium, and for [35S]CaM purification in M9 medium (33.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.1% glucose, 1 μg/ml thiamine, and 0.2 mm each of the amino acids, excluding methionine. Both cultures were grown at 30 °C until the culture density reached anA 600 = 0.4 and CaM synthesis was induced by shifting the cultures to 41 °C. For [35S]CaM preparation, [35S]Express 35S Tag labeling solution (1175 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products Inc.) was added to the cultures at the time of the temperature shift to give a concentration of 10 μCi/ml. After 2 h the cells were harvested, and CaM was purified as described (34.Putkey J.A. Slaughter G.R. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4704-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Szymanska G. O'Connor M.B. O'Connor C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Approximately 80 μg of [35S]CaM was obtained from a 100-ml culture (specific activity: 200,000 cpm/μg). HA-CaM and [35S]CaM (≥100 μm) were incubated for 2 weeks at 37 °C in 50 mm Na-HEPES or K-HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EGTA as described (18.Johnson B.A. Langmack E.L. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12283-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control (“native”) samples were incubated for the same time in 50 mm Na-HEPES or K-HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 5 mmCaCl2. Native and aged CaM has the same mobility on SDS-PAGE (36.Desrosiers R.R. Romanik E.A. O'Connor C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21368-21374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); therefore they were routinely analyzed by nondenaturing PAGE, in the presence of 2 mm EDTA (18.Johnson B.A. Langmack E.L. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12283-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For two-dimensional separations, strips containing the different CaMs were cut from nondenaturing gels containing EDTA and equilibrated for 10 min in sample buffer containing 2 mm EDTA or 5 mmCaCl2. These strips were then layered across the top of a second native gel that contained either 2 mm EDTA or 5 mm CaCl2 in the gel solutions and running buffer. Xenopus oocytes were first injected with 47 nl of a solution containing 10 pmol of lactacystin in 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 6.8, using a Nanoject injection apparatus. The lactacystin was diluted from a 10 mm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide immediately before injection. A control group was injected with a similar dilution of dimethyl sulfoxide alone. Thirty min later, oocytes were injected with 2.5 ng of aged HA-CaM in 47 nl. The oocytes were incubated at 20 °C, and at indicated times, HA-CaM levels were measured in extracts prepared from groups of 10 oocytes using the immunoblotting method described previously (8.Szymanska G. Leszyk J.D. O'Connor C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28516-28523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were harvested by centrifugation and osmotically lysed by the addition of 5 volumes of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT). The mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min, then homogenized with 12 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation for 15 min at 10,000 ×g, the supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. This supernatant was concentrated by the addition of solid (NH4)2SO4 to 80% saturation, stirred at 4 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 × g. The precipitate was resuspended in 15 volume of 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 20 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μm chymostatin, and 20 μm E64, and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 20 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol at 4 °C overnight and stored at −70 °C until use. Native or aged [35S]CaM (∼2 μg) was added to a 50-μl reaction containing 500 μg of HeLa cell extract supplemented with an ATP-regenerating system (10 mm creatine phosphate, 0.2 mg/ml creatine kinase) and protease inhibitors (50 μmE64, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μm chymostatin) in Buffer H (Buffer H: 50 mmNa-HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmATP, 1 mm DTT) in the presence of 5 mmCaCl2 or EGTA. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (at a final concentration of 12%), and the acid soluble radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. (To determine the proteasome-mediated degradation of [35S]CaM, parallel reactions were carried out in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor, MG-132 (50 μm), and the difference between total degradation and that in the presence of MG-132 was calculated.) Degradation was linear during the time period studied and proportional to the protein concentration of the extract. Native or aged [35S]CaM (∼2 μg in 50 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mmEGTA) was added to a 20-μl reaction containing 2 mmAMP-PNP, 30 μm MG-132, 1.5 μm ubiquitin aldehyde, 25 μm ubiquitin, and 50 μg of HeLa cell extract (37.Solomon V. Lecker S.H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25216-25222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 20 mmKCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT. Additional Ca2+ or EGTA was added to the individual reactions to reach final concentrations of 5 mm. In the control experiment in Fig. 3 a, 10 μg of Me-Ub was also added to the reaction (38.Hershko A. Heller H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 15% acrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were incubated for 20 min in 30% methanol, 10% acetic acid with gentle stirring, dried, and analyzed using a Fuji PhosphorImager. Densitometric analysis of the gels was carried out with Image Gauge software; the results are presented in arbitrary units. 26 S proteasomes were prepared from young rabbit muscles as described previously (32.Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3363-3371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Native or aged [35S]CaM (13.0 μm) were incubated with the proteasomes (28 nm) in Buffer H in the presence of 5 mmCaCl2 or EGTA. Aliquots were removed at the indicated time points, mixed with 100 μl of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 12%). Acid-soluble counts were measured as above. In certain experiments14C-β-casein and 14C-α-lactalbumin (reduced and carboxymethylated (32.Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3363-3371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar)), specific activity 40,000 cpm/μg) were incubated with the proteasomes under the same conditions. Peptidase activity of the 26 S proteasomes (33 pm) was determined by measuring the hydrolysis of succinyl-LLVY-aminomethyl coumarin (100 μm, Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland) in Buffer H containing either 5 mm CaCl2 or EGTA. The release of the fluorescent product, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin, was measured in an Aminco-Bowman luminescence spectrometer by continuous assay (wavelength of excitation: 380 nm, emission 460 nm). To assay ATP-dependent proteolysis, the ATP present in the 26 S proteasome preparations was removed by gel filtration using a NICK spin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated with 50 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 20% glycerol. After spinning, the proteasomes were divided into two parts and used immediately for the degradation reactions: one part was supplemented with ATP (1 mm) and the other with buffer only. Conformational changes accompanying Ca2+binding and deamidation of CaM have been demonstrated using nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (18.Johnson B.A. Langmack E.L. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12283-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Desrosiers R.R. Romanik E.A. O'Connor C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21368-21374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To compare the conformational changes that occur upon Ca2+ binding in native CaM and in the in vitro aged species (incubated for 2 weeks at 37 °C and pH 7.4 in the absence of Ca2+), we extended this approach, using two-dimensional gels that were run in the presence of EDTA in the first dimension and in the presence of either EDTA or Ca2+ in the second dimension. In the first dimension, in the presence of EDTA, native CaM migrated as one predominant species plus two minor, slower variants. By contrast, aged CaM was resolved into at least four major and two minor variants, most of which showed a lower electrophoretic mobility than the predominant form of native CaM (data not shown). These differences were most clear when electrophoresis was carried out in the second dimension in the presence of EDTA, when the different aged species were distributed along the diagonal (Fig. 1). The reduced electrophoretic mobility of aged CaM variants on native gels has been attributed to their having a more extended conformation (18.Johnson B.A. Langmack E.L. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12283-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), since on the basis of charge alone, the deamidation occurring during aging would be expected to increase the proteins negative charge and electrophoretic mobility. The low amounts of slowly migrating variants in native CaM are due to isomerization of aspartyl residues at positions outside the Ca2+-binding regions (6.Ota I.M. Clarke S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4020-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17.Ota I.M. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 54-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When electrophoresis was performed in the presence of Ca2+(5 mm) in the second dimension, the native CaM (including the minor variants) showed a large decrease in electrophoretic mobility, which is characteristic of Ca2+-liganded CaM. By contrast, most of the species present in the aged CaM preparation, when separated in the presence of Ca2+, showed a smaller mobility shift away from the diagonal than was seen with the native CaM. This mobility difference may reflect decreased Ca2+binding by the aged species and/or a reduced ability of the bound Ca2+ to induce the same conformational changes in the aged CaM as in the native form. In addition, a small amount of the aged CaM showed an electrophoretic mobility shift, which was similar to that observed for the native species. Thus, some unmodified CaM appears to persist even after 2 weeks of in vitro aging. These findings support the prior observations that the presence of isoaspartyl residues in the Ca2+-binding regions of aged CaM alters its conformation and may interfere with Ca2+-binding or Ca2+-induced conformational changes (6.Ota I.M. Clarke S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4020-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Following in vitro aging, hemagglutinin-tagged CaM (HA-CaM) is rapidly degraded upon microinjection intoXenopus oocytes (8.Szymanska G. Leszyk J.D. O'Connor C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28516-28523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). By contrast, HA-CaM that was freshly isolated or was preincubated for 2 weeks in the presence of Ca2+ was stable for several hours after microinjection (8.Szymanska G. Leszyk J.D. O'Connor C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28516-28523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To determine if proteasomes catalyze this selective destruction of the aged CaM, the oocytes were injected with the specific proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin (39.Craiu A. Gaczynska M. Akopian T. Gramm C.F. Fenteany G. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13437-13445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), 30 min prior to CaM injection. In the untreated oocytes, the aged HA-CaM had a half-life of approximately 40 min (Fig. 2, upper panel). However, when lactacystin was injected in amounts that should give a final intracellular concentration found maximally effective in cultured cells (∼10 μm) (39.Craiu A. Gaczynska M. Akopian T. Gramm C.F. Fenteany G. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13437-13445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), it prevented the degradation of the aged HA-CaM (Fig. 2, lower panel). These results clearly implicate the proteasomes in the degradation of aged HA-CaM in oocytes. However, no accumulation of ubiquitinated derivatives of HA-CaM (i.e. higher molecular weight forms) could be detected in either the presence or absence of lactacystin (see below). To study the mechanisms responsible for the rapid degradation of aged CaM, we investigated this process in HeLa cell extracts, which have previously been shown to carry out both the ubiquitination and the degradation of many intracellular proteins (37.Solomon V. Lecker S.H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25216-25222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Degradation and ubiquitination of native and aged [35S]CaM were studied both in the presence and absence of Ca2+, because the data in Fig. 1 suggested major structural differences between native and aged CaM upon Ca2+ binding. In extracts containing EGTA to chelate Ca2+, aged [35S]CaM was degraded 8 times more rapidly than native [35S]CaM (Table I). The addition of high concentrations of Ca2+ (5 mm) reduced the rate of hydrolysis of native [35S]CaM to almost half of that observed in the absence of Ca2+. The rate of degradation of aged [35S]CaM was also reduced by the addition of Ca2+, but the relative effect was smaller (−26%). Thus, in the presence of Ca2+, the difference in the rate of degradation between aged and native [35S]CaM was even more pronounced; the aged species was degraded 11 times faster. These results are in good agreement with the findings in oocytes (Fig. 2 and Ref. 8.Szymanska G. Leszyk J.D. O'Connor C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28516-28523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) demonstrating that aged CaM is degraded much more rapidly than the native molecule.Table IDegradation and ubiquitination of native and aged CaM in HeLa extractsSubstrateTotal degradationEffect of Ca2+ addition+EGTA+Ca2+pmol h −1 mg −1% changeNative CaM0.37 ± 0.040.20 ± 0.01−46%Aged CaM3.04 ± 0.512.25 ± 0.25−26%Proteasome-mediated degradationpmol h −1 mg −1% changeNative CaM0.17 ± 0.020.08 ± 0.01−53%Aged CaM1.83 ± 0.551.24 ± 0.18−32%Ubiquitin conjugatesarbitrary unit% changeNative CaM3372113+527%Aged CaM5071087+114%Native and aged [35S]CaM degradation and ubiquitination were assayed in HeLa extracts containing 5 mm CaCl2 or EGTA.

Corneal keratan sulfate proteoglycans (KSPG) are unique products of keratocytes that are down-regulated in corneal wounds and in vitro. This study used cultures of primary bovine keratocytes to define factors affecting KSPG expression in vitro. KSPG metabolically labeled with [35S]sulfate decreased during the initial 2–4 days of culture in quiescent cultures with low serum concentrations (0.1%). Addition of fetal bovine serum, fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), transforming growth factor β, or platelet derived growth factor all stimulated cell division, but only FGF-2 stimulated KSPG secretion. Combined with serum, FGF-2 also prevented serum-induced KSPG down-regulation. KSPG secretion was lost during serial subculture with or without FGF-2. Expression of KSPG core proteins (lumican, mimecan, and keratocan) was stimulated by FGF-2, and steady state mRNA pools for these proteins, particularly keratocan, were significantly increased by FGF-2 treatment. KSPG expression therefore is supported by exogenous FGF-2 and eliminated by subculture of the cells in presence of serum.

This tissue consists of a unique transparent extracellular matrix populated by keratocytes, flattened mesenchymal cells responsible for production and maintenance of this matrix. In healing corneal wounds keratocytes become activated, begin mitosis, and migrate to the wound location, where they secrete nontransparent scar components (1.Cintron C. Schneider H. Kublin C. Exp. Eye Res. 1973; 17: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 2.Cintron C. Kublin C.L. Dev. Biol. 1977; 61: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cells in the healing wound are characterized by secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1α and proteolytic enzymes involved in tissue remodeling, collagenase, gelatinase, and stromelysin (3.West-Mays J.A.

This remodeling (fibroblastic) phenotype is simulated in vitro when keratocytes are cultured in medium containing fetal bovine serum and subcultured by trypsinization (5.Fini M.E. Girard M.T. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 373-383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The extracellular matrix of the normal corneal stroma is characterized by a unique class of molecules known as the corneal keratan sulfate proteoglycans (KSPG). 1The abbreviations used are: KSPG, keratan sulfate proteoglycan; FBS, fetal bovine serum; FGF-2, fibroblast growth factor-2; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DMEM/F-12, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium, 1:1.1The abbreviations used are: KSPG, keratan sulfate proteoglycan; FBS, fetal bovine serum; FGF-2, fibroblast growth factor-2; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DMEM/F-12, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium, 1:1. These consist of three structurally related proteins modified withN-linked keratan sulfate chains (6.Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14226-14231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The three proteins (lumican, keratocan, and mimecan) are found in a number of connective tissues but are expressed at much higher levels in the cornea compared with noncorneal tissues (7.Funderburgh J.L.

In noncorneal tissues, these proteins are not modified with keratan sulfate (10.Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24773-24777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The high level of expression of these three proteins combined with a specialized glycosylation is a property unique to keratocytes and constitutes an essential feature of the role of the keratocyte in maintenance of corneal transparency. This conclusion is supported by the recent demonstration that mice bearing null mutations in the lumican gene lose corneal transparency, whereas mice with a similar mutation in the gene for decorin, the major corneal chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan, maintain clear corneas (11.Chakravarti S.

During corneal development, secretion of KSPG commences very soon after migrating neural crest cells enter the primary corneal stroma (13.Funderburgh J.L. Caterson B. Conrad G.W. Dev. Biol. 1986; 116: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A number of early studies reported that when removed from the stroma, keratocytes rapidly lose the ability to secrete keratan sulfate (14.Conrad G.W. Dorfman A. Exp.

We examined this in vitro down-regulation of KSPG using cultured bovine keratocytes and reported that these cells continue to secrete KSPG proteins, but the proteins are modified with truncated under-sulfated keratan sulfate chains (22.Funderburgh J.L.

A recent study has shown that primary bovine keratocytes in low-serum or serum-free media maintain KSPG secretion for several days in culture, whereas growth in 10% fetal bovine serum resulted in decreased KSPG synthesis (23.Beales M.P. Funderburgh J.L. Jester J.V. Hassell H.R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1658-1663PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent association between cell division and loss of KSPG secretion both in vivo and in vitro suggests that mitosis per se may be involved in KSPG down-regulation. In the current study we examined the response of freshly isolated bovine keratocytes to cytokines and serum to better define the cellular environment that determines maintenance and/or loss of expression of the KSPG differentiation marker. We report that keratocyte mitosis is not directly linked to KSPG down-regulation but that subculture after trypsin treatment, particularly in the presence of mitogen-rich fetal bovine serum, results in irreversible loss of KSPG synthesis. The presence of FGF-2, however, supports KSPG synthesis by induction of core protein biosynthesis. Central portions of fresh corneas from slaughter-aged steers were incubated in 0.2% trypsin in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (DMEM/F-12; Sigma, D6905) containing antibiotics (penicillin, 100 units/ml; streptomycin 100 μg/ml; gentamicin, 50 μg/ml; amphotericin B, 2.5 μg/ml) for 16 h at 4 °C followed by 30 min at 37 °C. Epithelial and endothelial cells were removed by scraping with a plastic spatula (Cell Lifter; Fisher 08-773-1) in cold saline. The tissue was rinsed, minced into 2–3-mm cubes with razor blades, and shaken at 37 °C, 70 rpm for 2–3 h in a volume of 1 ml/corneal stoma of 1% (w/v) collagenase (Sigma C8176 L) in DMEM/F-12 with antibiotics until complete disruption of the tissue was achieved. The cell suspension was passed through a 70-μm nylon mesh (Cell Strainer, Falcon 2350), washed twice by centrifugation in DMEM/F-12 with antibiotics, and plated at 3–4 × 104cells/cm2 in polystyrene tissue culture vessels (Costar 3506 or Corning 25100) in DMEM/F-12 with antibiotics containing insulin 5 μg/ml, selenous acid, 5 ng/ml, and transferrin 5 μg/ml (ITS, Collaborative Research Inc., Lexington, MA) and 0.1% platelet-poor horse serum (Sigma) as described previously (22.Funderburgh J.L.

In some experiments the serum concentration of this medium was altered as noted. Media were changed after 24 h of culture and subsequently at 48-h intervals. At termination of cultures, cells were rinsed twice with saline, and cell number was estimated by lysis of the attached cell layer at 37 °C for 30 min in 10 mm NaOH, 1% SDS. Cell number was calculated from absorbance at 260 nm of the lysate based on a standard curve obtained by hemocytometer counting of cells released by trypsin. Sulfated proteoglycans were labeled with 100 μCi/ml of carrier-free H235SO4 (ICN Radiochemicals 640405) or with 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (TransLabel, ICN 51006). 48 h after labeling, the culture medium from each well was collected and combined with a rinse of the cell layer with saline. This soluble fraction contained >95% of the detectable proteoglycan and was used as the source for KSPG purification and analysis. Analysis of total [35S]methionine-labeled secreted proteins was carried out by repeated concentration of the labeled culture medium in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, using centrifugal ultrafiltration with a 3-kDa cut-off to remove unincorporated label, followed by separation of the proteins by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Purification of proteoglycans from the media was achieved by passing the culture medium and rinse through SPEC-3 ml-NH2microcolumns (Ansys, Inc., 531-07-20) preactivated with methanol and distilled water as per manufacturer's instructions. The columns were rinsed with 3 ml of 6 m urea, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.02m Tris-HCl, pH 8. Proteoglycans were eluted from the column with 0.4 ml of 4 m guanidine HCl, 0.02 mTris-HCl, pH 8. Incorporation of sulfate into KSPG and chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan was assessed by adsorption of aliquots of the purified proteoglycans to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in Millipore Multiscreen 96-well plates (MAIP N4510, Millipore Corp). The membranes were rinsed in water and blocked with 50 μl of 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in 0.1 mTris-acetate, pH 8. Duplicate sets of samples were treated with 50 μl in the same solution with or without 0.1 unit/ml affinity-purified chondroitinase ABC (Sigma). The plate was covered and incubated in a humidified chamber at 37 °C for 16 h. The membranes were rinsed with TBS (0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01% (w/v) thimerosal), and bound radioactivity was determined by excising the filters and scintillation counting. Immobilized proteoglycan radioactivity sensitive to chondroitinase was representative of the amount of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan in the sample, and chondroitinase-resistant radioactivity approximated the amount of KSPG. Column eluates were dialyzed against 0.1m Tris-acetate, pH 8, followed by digestion with chondroitinase ABC 0.1 unit/ml or keratanase II (Seikagaku) and/or endo-β-galactosidase (Sigma) each at 0.02 unit/ml for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by separation on a 3–12% acrylamide gel as described previously (24.Funderburgh J.L.

The separated proteoglycans were electrophoretically transferred to Millipore Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, standards were detected by staining with Ponceau S, and radioactivity was detected on x-ray film using BioMax low energy transcreen (Millipore Corp.) at −70 °C.

The immobilized antibody was incubated with dialyzed proteoglycan eluate at 4 °C for 16 h in 1% bovine serum albumin in TTBS. The bound proteoglycan was rinsed once in 1% Triton X-100 in TTBS at room temperature and rinsed three additional times in TTBS for 5 min. Bound proteoglycans were released from pellets at 70 °C for 30 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (24.Funderburgh J.L. Hevelone N.D. Roth M.R. Funderburgh M.L. Rodrigues M.R. Nirankari V.S. Conrad G.W.

In an effort to define factors involved in KSPG regulation we compared KSPG secretion by primary keratocytes isolated by collagenase (23.Beales M.P. Funderburgh J.L. Jester J.V. Hassell H.R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1658-1663PubMed Google Scholar) to that from cells obtained by outgrowth corneal explants (22.Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Prakash S. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31431-31436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) using SDS-PAGE and immunodetection by monoclonal antibody I22, which recognizes sulfated regions of keratan sulfate chains (25.Funderburgh J.L. Stenzel-Johnson P.R. Chandler J.W. Curr. Eye Res. 1982; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Fig.1 A (lane 1) shows that primary cells secreted a heterogeneous high molecular weight material reacting with the antibody, similar in size to purified bovine corneal KSPG (lane 3). Culture medium from the outgrowth cells (lane 2) had virtually no KSPG reacting with this antibody. Active secretion of a high molecular weight KSPG by the primary cultures was confirmed by metabolically labeling with [35S]sulfate (Fig. 1 B). Approximately 20–25% of the labeled proteoglycan was resistant to digestion with chondroitinase ABC (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). This chondroitinase-resistant proteoglycan had a size distribution similar to the KSPG identified with antibody I22 and was >90% sensitive to keratanase digestion (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). Molecules with properties similar to normal corneal KSPG, therefore, appear to make up a significant proportion of the proteoglycans secreted by these cells in culture. Confirmation of the chondroitinase-resistant35S-labeled proteoglycans as KSPG was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation using antibody I22. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the macromolecular components of the immunoprecipitated proteoglycans were sensitive to endo-β-galactosidase and specifically competed with unlabeled purified KSPG. A 50 kDa band generated by endo-β-galactosidase (Fig. 1 C, lane 2) is the previously determined size of KSPG core proteins. Labeling of this band may result from tyrosine sulfation of these proteins (7.Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Brown S.J. Vergnes J.P. Hassell J.R. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11874-11880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). KSPG secreted by quiescent primary keratocytes is larger and more highly sulfated than that we described previously in cells that had undergone extensive cell division (22.Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Prakash S. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31431-31436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that active cell division may be involved in modulation of KSPG expression. We examined this hypothesis by treatment of the primary cells with mitogens. The primary keratocytes divided rapidly in the presence of several cytokines and sera (Fig.2 A), but KSPG secretion exhibited a mixed response to these agents, Fig. 2 B. As we found previously (23.Beales M.P. Funderburgh J.L. Jester J.V. Hassell H.R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1658-1663PubMed Google Scholar), FBS reduced the amount of sulfated KSPG, however other mitotic agents such as platelet-derived growth factor and interleukin 1α had little effect. One mitogen, FGF-2 (also known as basic fibroblast growth factor) clearly increased KSPG secretion in comparison with the other treatments. Immunoprecipitation of the KSPG from these cultures with anti-keratan sulfate antibodies (Fig.2 C) provided results similar to the solid phase assay of keratan sulfate and also showed that KSPG secreted in the presence of transforming growth factor β or FBS is somewhat smaller in size than that from control cultures. Stimulation of KSPG by FGF-2, as shown in Fig.3 A, required a minimum of 2–4 days of exposure. Without FGF-2, KSPG secretion dropped about 50–70% during a 6-day culture. period, but in the presence of FGF-2, KSPG secretion was stimulated after a 2-day lag period. At the end of the 6-day period sulfated KSPG secretion was as much as 10-fold greater than cultures without FGF-2. The amount of stimulation was a function of FGF-2 concentration and below 1 ng/ml closely matched the increase in cell number (Fig. 3 B). At FGF-2 concentrations above 1 ng/ml, however, the KSPG per cell secretion increased slightly in comparison to control. Concentrations greater than 10 ng/ml FGF-2 were difficult to assay because these resulted in loss of cell attachment (not shown). Previously, culture of primary cells in 10% FBS was found to result in a significant reduction in KSPG secretion (23.Beales M.P. Funderburgh J.L. Jester J.V. Hassell H.R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1658-1663PubMed Google Scholar). When FGF-2 was combined with FBS, however, KSPG secretion on a per cell basis was maintained at the level of the cultures in 0.1% horse serum (Fig.4 A). We showed earlier that keratocytes subcultured using trypsin and grown in FBS secrete very little KSPG (22.Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Prakash S. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31431-31436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This conclusion was confirmed in Fig. 1 A(lane 2). When serial subculture was carried out in FGF-2 and 1% FBS, keratocytes also lost KSPG secretion (Fig. 4 B), albeit more gradually than cultures without FGF. This loss of KSPG secretion was not reversed by removal of serum from the cultures (data not shown). Sulfate is incorporated primarily into the keratan sulfate chains of the KSPG, and previously we found that in passaged cells, keratan sulfate chains were severely truncated (22.Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Prakash S. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31431-31436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Keratan sulfate chain length, examined by gel filtration chromatography, of protease-treated KSPG showed that keratan sulfate in untreated primary cultures (Fig.5 B) eluted later, indicating a somewhat smaller molecular mass compared with keratan sulfate made by intact bovine corneas (Fig. 5 A). The most abundant keratan sulfate chains after FGF-2 treatment (Fig. 5 C) were similar in size to those in untreated cultures; however, more label eluted in earlier (high molecular weight) fractions after FGF-2 treatment than in the control cultures, indicating an increased proportion of longer keratan sulfate chains after FGF-2 treatment. Keratan sulfate from cells maintained in 10% FBS (Fig. 5 D) were clearly smaller than those from untreated cultures. The moderate changes in keratan sulfate chain length shown in Fig. 5indicate that the dramatic alterations in sulfate-labeled KSPG in response to FGF-2 seen in Figs. 2 and 4 cannot be explained completely in terms of keratan sulfate chain length. These data suggest that an increase in the secretion of the proteins to which the keratan sulfate chains are attached may be involved. This hypothesis was supported by the observation that FGF-2 clearly stimulated incorporation of [35S]methionine into secreted KSPG (Fig.6 A). To assess whether these KSPG core proteins were stimulated on a per cell basis, equal amounts of nonfractionated methionine-labeled proteins from FGF-2-treated and control cultures were separated before or after treatment with endo-β-galactosidase to release proteins bound to keratan sulfate chains (Fig. 6 B). KSPG core proteins released by endo-β-galactosidase exhibiting an apparent molecular mass of 48–50 kDa could be clearly differentiated from other labeled proteins in the culture media (Fig. 6 B, arrow). Densitometric analysis of the autoradiograms indicated a 4.5-fold increase in KSPG proteins in FGF-2 treated cultures on a per cell basis (Fig.6 C). Pool sizes of mRNA of the KSPG proteins were examined with a ribonuclease protection assay. As seen in Fig.7 A, levels of all three mRNAs increased in the presence of FGF-2, but levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA did not change. In Fig. 7 B, densitometric analysis of the individual protected bands found that lumican transcripts increased 2–3-fold, mimecan showed only a slight increase, and the keratocan mRNA increased 8–10-fold during 6 days of treatment in FGF-2. Summing all three KSPG mRNAs showed an approximate 3-fold increase as a result of FGF-2 treatment. This report examines factors that affect in vitrosecretion of corneal KSPG proteins bearing macromolecular keratan sulfate chains. The lability of corneal keratan sulfate synthesis has been well established in the literature (14.Conrad G.W. Dorfman A. Exp. Eye Res. 1974; 18: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16.Klintworth G.K. Smith C.F. Lab. Invest. 1981; 44: 553-559PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Dahl I.M. Laurent T.C. Exp.

Sci. 1992; 33: 547-557PubMed Google Scholar), yet it is only recently that the mechanism of this down-regulation has begun to be investigated in detail. A report from our laboratory showed that passaged bovine keratocytes express the KSPG proteins in culture but observed these to be modified with oligolactosamine chains bearing minimal sulfation, rather than the fully sulfated keratan sulfate chains typical of normal corneas (22.Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Prakash S. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31431-31436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In 1996 Jester et al.(29.Jester J.V. Barry-Lane P.A. Cavanagh H.D. Petroll W.M. Cornea. 1996; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that primary keratocytes under serum-free conditions maintained a dendritic morphology typical of keratocytes in the normal cornea in vivo. More recently, Beales et al. (23.Beales M.P. Funderburgh J.L. Jester J.V. Hassell H.R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1658-1663PubMed Google Scholar) reported that primary keratocytes in low serum and serum-free conditions secrete KSPG similar to that made in vivo, providing an initiation point for the current investigation. The Beales study also demonstrated dermatan sulfate-containing proteoglycans to be regulated independently of those with keratan sulfate. Thus in the current work we have avoided expressing keratan sulfate synthesis in terms of its relative abundance compared with other proteoglycans (a frequent means of assessing glycosaminoglycan secretion), choosing rather to examine the rate of synthesis of KSPG components (proteins and keratan sulfate) on a per cell basis. This provides a measure of KSPG regulation that is independent of other proteoglycans. Most previous studies of KSPG secretion used keratocytes cultured in the presence of fetal bovine serum, and most also had been expanded by trypsinization and subculturing. Both of these culture conditions result in loss of fully sulfated KSPG secretion in bovine keratocytes (Figs. 2, 4, and 5). Our current data suggest that this well documented down-regulation of KSPG in keratocytes may involve alterations in both KSPG protein expression and in the glycosylation of these proteins with keratan sulfate chains. The action of FGF-2 to promote secretion of KSPG appears to result mainly from increased expression of KSPG proteins, particularly of keratocan. In primary cultures, reduction of KSPG secretion by fetal bovine serum was largely reversed by FGF-2, suggesting that the initial effect of serum may also be related to protein secretion levels. FBS treatment, however, also altered keratan sulfate chain size (Fig. 5 D). The current data show that KSPG secretion in subcultured cells was not reversed by FGF-2, and our previous study showed that passaged keratocytes do not secrete fully sulfated keratan sulfate chains (22.Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Prakash S. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31431-31436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that KSPG loss may also involve down-regulation of enzymes involved in keratan sulfate sulfation or elongation. This hypothesis is supported by the data of Nakazawa et al. (36.Nakazawa K. Takahashi I. Yamamoto Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 269-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which showed a dramatic loss of keratan sulfate glucosamine sulfotransferase activity in chick keratocytes cultured in serum for 7 days. Full understanding of the cellular mechanisms that control KSPG secretion will clearly require more study. Our current findings, however, demonstrate a useful experimental system with which we can begin the unraveling of the long-standing enigma of KSPG biosynthesis. The current study is not the first to examine the effects of FGF on keratocytes. Nakazawa et al. (30.Nakazawa K. Morita A. Nakano H. Mano C. Tozawa N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) reported a modest increase of both keratan sulfate and dermatan sulfate as a result of a 16-h FGF-2 treatment of primary chick keratocytes in collagen gels. These results are not inconsistent with our findings (from Fig. 3) that 2–4 days is required before the most significant effects on KSPG can be observed in primary bovine keratocytes. A report by Jester et al. (29.Jester J.V. Barry-Lane P.A. Cavanagh H.D. Petroll W.M. Cornea. 1996; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that 7 days of FGF-2 treatment of primary keratocytes reversed the induction of α-smooth muscle actin, a myofibroblastic marker, in response to serum or transforming growth factor β. These results suggest that FGF may alter a range of keratocyte cellular functions. That FGF-2 may be a generalized differentiation factor for corneal stroma is not unlikely. Action of FGF-2 during embryonic development is important in the differentiation of numerous tissues including lens and retina (31.Bosco L. Venturini G. Willems D. Development. 1997; 124: 421-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Araki M. Yamao M. Tsudzuki M. Dev. Growth Differ. 1998; 40: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). FGF-2 has also been implicated as a survival factor for a variety of quiescent or terminally differentiated cells (33.Shaw R. Cianchetti R. Pleasure D. Kreider B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Smooth muscle cells in culture maintain differentiated characteristics via autocrine expression of FGF-2 and enter apoptosis when this secretion is blocked (34.Fox J.C. Shanley J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12578-12584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Keratocytes express both mRNA for FGF-2 and for its receptor (35.Li D.Q. Tseng S.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). It seems reasonable to hypothesize, therefore, based on our current data, that autocrine FGF-2 production by keratocytes may be involved in the maintenance of the differentiated keratocyte phenotype in vivo."

In the present study, we demonstrate that, upon ligand binding and incubation at 37 °C, the EGFR was polyubiquitinated regardless of overexpression of mutant dynamin. In cells not overexpressing mutant dynamin, the EGFR was rapidly internalized and deubiquitinated. In cells being endocytosis-deficient, due to overexpression of mutant dynamin, however, the EGFR was upon prolonged chase first found in deeply invaginated coated pits, and then eventually moved out of the coated pits and back onto the smooth plasma membrane. Polyubiquitination occurred equally efficiently in cells with or without intact clathrin-dependent endocytosis, while the kinetics of ubiquitination and deubiquitination was somewhat different. We further found that the EGF-induced ubiquitination of Eps15 occurred both in the absence and presence of endocytosis with the same kinetics as polyubiquitination of the EGFR, but that the EGF-induced monoubiquitination of Eps15 was somewhat reduced upon overexpression of mutant dynamin. Our data show that EGF-induced polyubiquitination of the EGFR occurs at the plasma membrane.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 881-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). Activation of EGFR thereby initiates signal transduction cascades important for cellular growth and differentiation. Furthermore, binding of EGF mediates translocation of the EGFR to clathrin-coated pits, internalization of the EGFR via clathrin-coated vesicles, transport through endosomes, and eventually degradation in lysosomes (2.Renfrew C.A. Hubbard A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21265-21273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Felder S. Miller K. Moehren G. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Hopkins C.R.

Activation of the EGFR by ligand binding at 37 °C was also demonstrated to induce polyubiquitination of the EGFR (5.Galcheva-Gargova Z. Theroux S.J. Davis R.J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2649-2655PubMed Google Scholar). No EGF-stimulated EGFR ubiquitination was found in experiments using a mutant kinase-negative EGFR or in experiments where clathrin-dependent endocytosis was prevented by low temperature or K+ depletion (5.Galcheva-Gargova Z. Theroux S.J. Davis R.J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2649-2655PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested a functional coupling between clathrin-dependent endocytosis and ubiquitination of the EGFR. Ubiquitination has been shown to be essential for endocytosis of the yeast α-factor receptor (6.Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) and for the growth hormone receptor (GHR) (7.Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In cells with a temperature-sensitive defect in ubiquitin conjugation, neither growth hormone (GH)-dependent internalization nor GH-dependent degradation of the GHR was observed at the non-permissive temperature (7.Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Further studies have demonstrated that when the internalization of the GHR was inhibited, GHR ubiquitination was also inhibited (8.Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These results also imply a connection between ubiquitin conjugation and endocytosis. It has so far been unclear whether ubiquitination occurs prior to or following the budding of clathrin-coated vesicles. In a recent study, Levkowitz et al. (9.Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) proposed that polyubiquitination of the EGFR occurs in endosomes. This was, however, not directly demonstrated. Instead, the authors demonstrated increased EGFR polyubiquitination and increased EGFR down-regulation by the overexpression of c-Cbl in Chinese hamster ovary cells. They furthermore demonstrated complex formation between c-Cbl and the EGFR upon incubation with EGF in cells overexpressing both c-Cbl and EGFR. Additionally, they showed that c-Cbl and the EGFR colocalized in endosomes upon addition of EGF. These data strongly support the recently suggested role for c-Cbl in the process of EGFR polyubiquitination (10.Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22151-22154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 11.Yokouchi M. Kondo T. Houghton A. Bartkiewicz M. Horne W.C. Zhang H. Yoshimura A. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31707-31712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), but do not clarify where in the cell ubiquitination occurs. It has been proposed by others that ubiquitination caused endocytosis of GHR by directing the GHR into clathrin-coated pits (8.Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that EGF stimulation of the EGFR induced a rapid relocalization of EGFR from the smooth plasma membrane into clathrin-coated pits in cells being endocytosis-deficient due to overexpression of the GTPase-deficient mutant K44A form of dynamin (12.Ringerike T. Stang E. Johannessen L.E. Sandnes D. Levy F.O. Madshus I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16639-16642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Clathrin-coated pits do not bud in cells overexpressing this mutant form of dynamin (13.Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar), and we took advantage of this system to study the trafficking, tyrosine phosphorylation, and ubiquitination of the EGF-stimulated EGFR in the absence of clathrin-dependent endocytosis. We found that in cells overexpressing K44A dynamin the EGFR transiently localized to coated pits, but that hardly any EGF·EGFR complexes were internalized. Nevertheless, polyubiquitination occurred as efficiently in endocytosis-deficient cells as in cells where clathrin-dependent endocytosis took place in a normal fashion. Our data therefore demonstrate for the first time that ubiquitination of the EGFR occurs at the plasma membrane prior to endocytosis. Human recombinant EGF was from Bachem Feinchemikalien AG (Budendorf, Switzerland). All reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise noted. HeLa cells transfected with K44A mutant dynamin (13.Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar) were a kind gift from Sandra L. Schmid (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (3.7 g/liter sodium bicarbonate) (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) containing 400 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, United Kingdom), 200 ng/ml puromycin, 2 mm l-glutamine (BioWhittaker), and 1× penicillin-streptomycin-fungizone mixture (17-745, BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker). Cells were seeded at a density of 15.000 cells/cm2 and grown for 24 h at 37 °C in the presence (uninduced) or absence (induced) of 1 μg/ml tetracycline as described (14.Damke H. Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bujard H. Schmid S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Expression of the transgene was routinely controlled by Western blotting as described (14.Damke H. Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bujard H. Schmid S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). After 24 h, cells were serum-starved by incubation for another 24 h in the same medium, but with 0.5% fetal bovine serum. The following antibodies were used: sheep anti-EGFR (Life Technologies, Inc., catalog no. 13287-016); rabbit anti-conjugated ubiquitin (Sigma); rabbit anti-Eps15 (C terminus) (Berkeley Antibody Company, Berkeley, CA); mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Sigma); peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-sheep-IgG, and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA); and phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Cells were incubated with 10−8m EGF for 15 min on ice, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4,2 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4), and chased in prewarmed EGF-free medium at 37 °C. At the end of the chase period, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in Soerensen's phosphate buffer, and processed for cryosections and immunogold labeling (15.Griffiths G. McDowall A. Back R. Dubochet J. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1984; 89: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The sections were labeled using sheep anti-EGFR antibody (Life Technologies, Inc., catalog no. 13287-016), followed by goat anti-sheep IgG-coated 18 nm colloidal gold (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratory Inc.). To quantify EGFR distribution, the number of gold particles localized to the plasma membrane were counted and sorted into two groups depending on whether the gold localized to clathrin-coated or to smooth plasma membrane areas. Labeling along the tube connecting coated pits with the rest of the plasma membrane was interpreted as labeling of non-coated plasma membrane. From each experiment micrographs from at least 10 randomly chosen cells were examined, and a minimum of 100 gold particles were counted. The percentage of distribution of gold particles to coated pits were calculated as (no. of gold particles on coated plasma membrane/total no. of gold particles at the plasma membrane) × 100. Labeling for Eps15 was performed using rabbit anti-Eps15 antibodies followed by protein A-coated colloidal gold (purchased from G. Posthuma and J. Slot, Utrecht, Holland). HeLa cells were preincubated with brefeldin A (17.Misumi Y. Misumi Y Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D.

Further processing was as for the experiments described above, but in the presence of brefeldin A. Chase-dependent redistribution of EGFR was quantified after immunolabeling by calculating EGFR labeling density/length of plasma membrane (16.Griffiths G. Fine Structure Immunology. Springer Verlag, Berlin1993Crossref Google Scholar) on micrographs from randomly chosen cells. EGF (10−8m) was added to cells in 12-well microtiter plates on ice for 15 min before the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and chased in prewarmed EGF-free medium at 37 °C. After incubation the cells were subjected to Western blot analysis as described (19.Skarpen E. Johannessen L.E. Bjerk K. Fasteng H. Guren T.K. Lindeman B. Thoresen G.H. Christoffersen T. Stang E. Huitfeldt H.S. Madshus I.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 243: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5 mmEDTA, 50 mm NaF, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2% (w/v) SDS (Bio-Rad), 4% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) on ice for 10 min. Then 0.033% (w/v) bromphenol blue and 4% (v/v) glycerol) was added, and the cell lysate was incubated at 95 °C for 10 min, centrifuged at 20.000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant fraction was subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE (20.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). The proteins were then electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (21.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). The reactive proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To quantify band intensity, and when Western blotting with antibody against ubiquitin, proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybond-P, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following SDS-PAGE. For quantification, the membrane was incubated with primary antibodies as described above before incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. The immunobinding was detected by the enhanced chemifluorescence method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the chemifluorescence was measured by a phosphorofluoroimager (STORM840, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Due to dispersion of the EGFR caused by ubiquitination, both the main band and the smear above the main band were quantified. When membranes were incubated with anti-ubiquitin antibody, 3% (w/v) gelatin in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% (w/v) Tween 20 was used as blocking reagent, and the immunobinding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using an ECL Plus kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). When immunoprecipitating the EGFR to determine the EGFR phosphorylation, the cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (PBS with 10 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 200 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mmNa3VO4). Then protein G-agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was incubated with sheep anti-EGFR antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The complexed antibody was washed twice in the buffer used for immunoprecipitation, and immunoprecipitation was performed at 4 °C for 60 min. In the experiment demonstrating ubiquitination of the EGFR, the immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as described by Strous et al. (7.Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in boiling buffer, containing 1% (w/v) SDS in PBS. After heating the lysates for 5 min at 100 °C, the cell lysates were homogenized using QIAshredder columns (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Then protein A-agarose and protein G-agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were incubated with rabbit anti-ubiquitin antibody and sheep anti-EGFR antibody, respectively, for 1 h at room temperature. The complexed antibody was washed twice in the immunoprecipitation buffer, consisting of 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 2 mmNa3VO4, 20 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 200 units/ml aprotinin in PBS, and immunoprecipitation was performed at 4 °C for 60 min. The immunoprecipitate was washed and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, as described above. 125I-EGF (10−8m; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the cells on ice in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) without HCO3−. After 15 min at 4 °C, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS to remove unbound ligand. The cells were then chased in minimal essential medium without HCO3− and with 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for the indicated time periods. The medium was collected, and the 125I-EGF was precipitated using 5% (w/v) tricloroacetic acid and 1% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid, as described (22.Sorkin A.D. Teslenko L.V. Nikolsky N.N. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Both the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable and the trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity were measured in a γ-counter. Cells were washed three times with PBS, treated with 0.2m sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5 or 7.4) containing 0.5m NaCl (SAB pH 4.5/SAB pH 7.4) on ice for 10 min, and washed once with the same buffer. Then 125I-EGF was precipitated from the cells with trichloroacetic acid and 1% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid. Finally, the precipitate was dissolved with 1m NaOH, and the radioactivity was measured. Counts/min from cells treated with SAB pH 4.5 represent internalized125I-EGF, while counts/min from cells treated with SAB pH 7.5 represent both internalized and surface-localized125I-EGF. Overexpression of K44A dynamin has been shown to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis (13.Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that although the overexpression of K44A dynamin disrupts high affinity binding of EGF to the EGFR, the EGFR is efficiently recruited into coated pits upon ligand binding (12.Ringerike T. Stang E. Johannessen L.E. Sandnes D. Levy F.O. Madshus I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16639-16642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Due to overexpression of K44A dynamin, coated pits were often found at the end of long tubular plasma membrane invaginations, and sometimes gathered in groups. In our previous study we only examined cells chased for 10 min at 37 °C. As coated pits do not bud and form coated vesicles in cells overexpressing K44A dynamin, we wanted to examine the trafficking of the EGFR upon extended chase periods at 37 °C. EGF (10−8m) was added to cells on ice for 15 min, the cells were washed free of unbound ligand and chased for increasing time periods at 37 °C. At the end of the chase period, the cells were fixed, sectioned, and immunocytochemically labeled using antibodies recognizing the EGFR. To estimate the EGF-induced redistribution of the EGFR, we quantified the amount of EGFR localizing to coated pits compared with the total amount of EGFR found at the plasma membrane. Immunocytochemical labeling showed that in cells not exposed to EGF, as well as in cells fixed immediately after binding of EGF on ice, the EGFR mainly localized outside coated pits (TableI and Fig.1 A). However, upon chasing at 37 °C, the EGFR was seen to relocalize rapidly from non-coated, uninvaginated plasma membrane areas into areas where the plasma membrane had a clear cytoplasmic coat (Fig. 1 B). At early time points (2–5 min) (Table I and Fig. 1 B), several of these coated areas were flat or only slightly invaginated. After a longer chase period (10–15 min) (Table I and Fig. 1 C), however, most of the coat-associated labeling was in coated pits connected to the plasma membrane by long tubular necks. After 10–15 min of chase, almost 50% of the EGFRs were seen in coated pits (TableI). The labeling was usually found associated with the coated, bulb-shaped blind end of the tubules, and it should be noted that almost no labeling was found along the tubular neck. Upon further chase, however, the EGFR started to appear along the tube while the bulb-shaped end remained coated and the number of EGFR associated with coated areas decreased (Table I and Fig. 1, D andE). Upon 60 min of chase at 37 °C, the distribution of plasma membrane-associated EGFR was almost as in cells not exposed to EGF (Table I).Table IEGF-induced redistribution of EGFR to coated pits in cells overexpressing mutant dynaminControl0 min2 min5 min10 min15 min30 min60 minPulse-chase13 ± 211 ± 234 ± 340 ± 449 ± 247 ± 330 ± 319 ± 1Brefeldin A12 ± 211 ± 211 ± 324 ± 241 ± 340 ± 112 ± 110 ± 3The distribution of the EGFR to coated versus non-coated areas of the plasma membrane in cells overexpressing mutant (K44A) dynamin was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The distribution of EGFR was determined in cells after binding of EGF on ice and chase at 37 °C in EGF-free medium (Pulse-chase) and in cells exposed to brefeldin A prior to, as well as during, a pulse-chase incubation (Brefeldin A). The table shows the percentage of total plasma membrane-associated EGFR labeling, that under each experimental condition localized to coated membrane areas. The control column shows the percentage amount of EGFR localized to coated pits in cells prior to incubation with EGF. The 0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min columns indicate the percentage amount of EGFR in coated pits upon these times of incubation at 37 °C.

Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. from a minimum of three independent experiments. Open table in a new tab The distribution of the EGFR to coated versus non-coated areas of the plasma membrane in cells overexpressing mutant (K44A) dynamin was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The distribution of EGFR was determined in cells after binding of EGF on ice and chase at 37 °C in EGF-free medium (Pulse-chase) and in cells exposed to brefeldin A prior to, as well as during, a pulse-chase incubation (Brefeldin A).

Labeling along the tube connecting the coated pits with the uninvaginated plasma membrane was interpreted as labeling of non-coated plasma membrane. Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. from a minimum of three independent experiments. Although the antibodies used recognize the intracellular part of the EGFR, labeling was in some cases found on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane (Fig. 1). Due to the size of the primary antibody recognizing the EGFR and the secondary antibody coating the colloidal gold, the observed distance from the gold particle to the antigen may be more than the width of a membrane (16.Griffiths G. Fine Structure Immunology. Springer Verlag, Berlin1993Crossref Google Scholar). The specificity of the anti-EGFR antibody was confirmed by Western blotting and was furthermore reflected by the EGF-induced change in labeling distribution. The colloidal gold contained a small amount of doublets (see Fig. 1 D), but when quantifying, eventual clusters were counted as one gold particle. Labeling of sections showed that independent of EGF binding and chase at 37 °C, some EGFR localized to the Golgi apparatus (data not shown). This labeling most likely represents newly synthesized EGFR. As including newly synthesized EGFR appearing at the plasma membrane during the chase period could complicate the study of ligand-induced trafficking of the EGFR, we treated cells with brefeldin A before addition of EGF as well as during the chase period. Brefeldin A prevents the transport of newly synthesized proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane by redistributing the cis and medial stacks of the Golgi apparatus back into the endoplasmic reticulum (17.Misumi Y. Misumi Y Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). Quantification of labeling on sections from brefeldin A-treated cells showed basically the same EGF-induced EGFR redistribution and transient localization to coated pits as found in cells not exposed to brefeldin A (see Table I). We conclude that, in cells deficient in endocytosis due to overexpression of K44A dynamin, EGFR moves to coated pits upon binding of EGF. The localization to clathrin-coated pits is transient, and the EGFR seems to loose its association with coat components and move back onto smooth, uninvaginated parts of the plasma membrane. To study the ligand-dependent redistribution of EGFR quantitatively, both with and without overexpression of mutant dynamin, we incubated cells with 10−8m125I-EGF on ice for 15 min before washing away unbound ligand and chasing the cells at 37 °C. At different time points, the fate of the initially bound125I-EGF was analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results show that the majority of the initially bound 125I-EGF in cells overexpressing K44A dynamin rapidly dissociated from the EGFR. Of the 125I-EGF that remained cell-associated, only a small amount was endocytosed, and eventually degraded (Fig. 2 A). This is consistent with the findings of Vieira et al. (23.Vieira A. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). The inhibition of EGFR endocytosis was further confirmed by immunocytochemical labeling for the EGFR. Quantification of labeling on sections from cells exposed to brefeldin A showed that the EGFR labeling density at the plasma membrane remained unchanged for up to 60 min of chase at 37 °C (data not shown). In cells grown with tetracycline (not overexpressing mutant dynamin),125I-EGF was rapidly endocytosed, with most ligand internalized upon 10 min of chase at 37 °C (Fig.2 B). Tyrosine-phosphorylated and dimerized EGFR have previously been shown to exist in endosomes (24.Sorkin A. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23453-23460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to correlate the tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR with its cellular localization, we incubated cells with 10−8mEGF on ice for 15 min before washing away unbound ligand and chasing the cells at 37 °C. Incubation with EGF on ice caused tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR both in noninduced cells and in cells overexpressing K44A dynamin (Fig.3 A). However, the EGFR was less efficiently tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells overexpressing K44A dynamin, compared with in cells not overexpressing mutant dynamin (Refs. 12.Ringerike T. Stang E. Johannessen L.E. Sandnes D. Levy F.O. Madshus I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16639-16642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar and 23.Vieira A. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar; Fig. 3 B). It should be noted that, upon overexpression of mutant dynamin, more EGFR were found at the plasma membrane (12.Ringerike T. Stang E. Johannessen L.E. Sandnes D. Levy F.O. Madshus I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16639-16642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated the specific tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR (Fig. 3 B) by normalizing the intensity of the phosphotyrosine signal with respect to the EGFR signal both in cells with and without overexpression of mutant dynamin. Chase at 37 °C caused a rapid dephosphorylation of the EGFR in both induced and noninduced cells. Once dephosphorylated, the EGFR in cells overexpressing K44A dynamin remained dephosphorylated. The kinetics of the dephosphorylation coincided with both entry of EGFR into coated pits and dissociation of ligand. In cells not overexpressing mutant dynamin, however, some of the EGFRs were transiently rephosphorylated upon prolonged chase at 37 °C (Fig. 3, A andB; 8, 10, and 12 min). When considering the kinetics of trafficking and phosphorylation, the rephosphorylation observed in cells not overexpressing mutant dynamin seemed to occur upon the EGFR reaching endosomes. When Western blotting with the anti-EGFR antibody, we found that the mobility of the EGFR was shifted as a function of ligand binding and chase at 37 °C, and by overexposing the film, a smear was clearly visible (Fig. 4 A).

https://openalex.org/W2169640925,"Bone sialoprotein is a 70-kDa extracellular matrix component that is intimately associated with biomineralization, yet the cis-acting elements of the Bsp gene that restrict its expression to mineralizing cells remain uncharacterized. To identify such elements, we analyzed a 2472-base pair fragment of the murine promoter that directs osteoblast-selective expression of a luciferase reporter gene and found that the region between –338 and –178 relative to the transcriptional start is crucial for its osteoblast-selective activity. We identified an element within this region that binds a protein complex in the nuclear extracts of osteoblastic cells and is required for its transcriptional activity. Introduction of a mutation that disrupts a homeodomain binding site within this sequence eliminates both its in vitro binding and nearly all of the osteoblastic-selective activity of the 2472-base pair promoter. We further found that the Dlx5 homeoprotein, which is able to regulate the osteoblast-specific osteocalcin promoter, can bind this element and stimulate its enhancer activity when overexpressed in COS7 cells. These data represent the first description of an osteoblast-specific element within the bone sialoprotein promoter and demonstrate its regulation by a member of a family of factors known to be involved in skeletogenesis.

This expression pattern, combined with evidence that BSP binds collagen (1.Fujisawa R. Nodasaka Y. Kuboki Y. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1995; 56: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and can nucleate hydroxyapatite formation in vitro (2.Goldberg H.A. Warner K.J. Stillman M.J. Hunter G.K. Connect Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), has led to the widely held theory that BSP plays a central role in biomineralization. In osteoblasts, which produce the vast majority of BSP, expression is further restricted to those cells that have secreted, and are actively mineralizing, a type I collagen matrix (3.Chen J. Shapiro H.S. Sodek J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 987-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Thus, BSP is one of the primary markers of the terminally differentiated osteoblast, and, as such, a study of its expression is important to our understanding of the transcriptional mechanisms that mediate osteoblast differentiation. Extensive studies of the osteocalcin gene 2, which encodes another osteoblast-specific protein, have revealed that its osteoblast-selective expression is dependent on binding sites for the Cbfa1 transcription factor in its promoter (namedosteoblast-specific element 2 (OSE2)) (4.Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Cbfa1, which itself exhibits bone-restricted expression, has since been shown to be required for osteoblast development in general, as Cbfa1 –/– mice lack functional osteoblasts (5.Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K. Deguchi K. Shimizu Y. Bronson R.T. Gao Y.H. Inada M. Sato M. Okamoto R. Kitamura Y. Yoshiki S. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1997; 89: 755-764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3628) Google Scholar). This finding prompted speculation that this factor may control the transcription of other osteoblast-related genes by binding similar OSE2 sites in their promoters. However, we recently investigated the contribution of two putative Cbfa1 binding sites to the activity of a 2.5-kb fragment of the murine Bsp promoter that exhibits osteoblast-selective expression. We found that neither site exhibited significant enhancer activity nor contributed to the activity of the 2.5-kb Bsp promoter, suggesting that other cis-acting elements must be responsible for its osteoblast-selective expression (6.Benson M.D. Aubin J.E. Xiao G. Thomas P.E. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although at first this result seems surprising, it is, perhaps, less so when we consider that BSP and osteocalcin are associated with different biochemical functions in vivo. That is, whereas BSP is associated with mineral formation, osteocalcin appears to play a role in bone resorption and turnover (7.Ducy P. Desbois C. Boyce B. Pinero G. Story B. Dunstan C. Smith E. Bonadio J. Goldstein S. Gundberg C. Bradley A. Karsenty G. Nature. 1996; 382: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar, 8.Defranco D.J. Lian J.B. Glowacki J. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to expect that these two genes, while both markers of the differentiated osteoblast, may be differently regulated. In addition to Cbf/runt sites, a number of other known enhancer sequences have been described within the Bsp promoter, but little progress has been made toward identification of the elements necessary for its osteoblastic-selective expression. Sodek and co-workers (9.Kim R.H. Li J.J. Ogata Y. Yamauchi M. Freedman L.P. Sodek J. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10.Ogata Y. Niisato N. Furuyama S.

However, none of these elements has been shown to confer tissue specificity. Kerr et al. (13.Kerr J.M. Hiscock D.R. Grzesik W. Robey P.G. Young M.F. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1997; 60: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) described a binding site for Ying Yang 1, a factor implicated in the transcriptional initiation of some TATA-less promoters, within intron 1 of the rat gene, which displayed higher levels of enhancer activity in UMR 106-01 osteosarcoma cells than in fibroblasts. However, since this sequence is not conserved in the corresponding region of either the human or mouse genes, and no intronic sequence is found in the –2472/+41 murine promoter, this element is clearly not essential for osteoblast-specific expression. Because efforts to link the tissue specificity of the Bsppromoter to a variety of known transcription factor binding sequences have so far been unsuccessful, we took the alternate approach of conducting a systematic study of the 2472-bp promoter to identify osteoblast-specific elements. As we report here, this study has revealed that a homeodomain binding site in the proximal promoter is required for the tissue-specific expression of the murineBsp gene. Furthermore, this site is positively regulated by the Dlx5 homeoprotein, which is known to play an important role in skeletogenesis.

Maintenance conditions for these cell lines were previously described (6.Benson M.D. Aubin J.E. Xiao G. Thomas P.E. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). COS7 monkey kidney cells (21.Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar) were the gift of Dr. Fred Askari (University of Michigan) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. C2C12 cells were induced to differentiate into myotubes by switching to 2% horse serum for 6 days. An adipose phenotype of lipid accumulation was induced in 3T3-L1 cells by growth in 30% fetal bovine serum for 6 days (19.Green H. Meuth M. Cell. 1974; 3: 127-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). F9 cells were induced to differentiate into endoderm by the addition of 0.1 μmretinoic acid and 1.0 mm dibutyryl cyclic AMP for 6 days (20.Strickland S. Mahdavi V. Cell. 1978; 15: 393-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Clone 4 differentiation was accomplished by the addition of 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid to the medium for 6 days to induce matrix synthesis and subsequent expression of osteoblast-related genes, including osteocalcin and BSP (22.Franceschi R.T. Iyer B.S. Parikh U.K. Pineron G.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: S218Google Scholar). Media were changed every 2 days during treatment. All adherent cell lines were plated in 35-mm dishes at a density of 25 × 104 cells/cm2 and transfected with the appropriate firefly luciferase reporter construct plus pRL-SV40Renilla luciferase vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) for normalization of transfection, using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (6.Benson M.D. Aubin J.E. Xiao G. Thomas P.E. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Cells were switched to the appropriate differentiation media and grown for 6 days, except for COS7 cells, which were additionally transfected with 100 ng of either pcDNA3-Dlx5 or pCMV5-β-gal expression plasmid and harvested 48 after transfection. S194 myeloma cells were transfected by electroporation as described elsewhere (6.Benson M.D. Aubin J.E. Xiao G. Thomas P.E. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). They were then transferred to growth medium for 48 h before harvesting. Luciferase expression in the cell lysates was assayed using the Dual Luciferase Reporter kit (Promega) and a Monolight 2010 luminometer (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). All transfection experiments were performed in triplicate at least three times. Values shown are the means ± standard deviations of triplicate samples from representative experiments. To produce Dlx5-containing or control COS7 nuclear extracts for gel shift experiments, cells were plated at the same density as above, but in 150-mm dishes, and transfected with either pcDNA3-Dlx5, or pCMV5-β-gal plasmid (see below). The cells were harvested after 48 h, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described below. Construction of pmBSP2472 was described previously (6.Benson M.D. Aubin J.E. Xiao G. Thomas P.E. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This vector, renamed p2472, contains the region of the murine Bsp gene from –2472 to +41 ligated upstream of a firefly luciferase reporter gene in pGL3Basic (Promega). The 5′-deletion constructs p705, p338, p178, and p49 were created byExoIII digestion of p2472 linearized with KpnI and MluI using the Erase-a-Base kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The p49BSP luciferase reporter vector was constructed by ligating a double-stranded, synthetic oligonucleotide containing the sequence of the basal murineBsp promoter from –49 to +41 into the BglII andHindIII sites of pGL3Basic. The p34OG2 vector containing a fragment of the osteocalcin gene 2 promoter from –34 to +1 was created in a similar fashion, as described previously (6.Benson M.D. Aubin J.E. Xiao G. Thomas P.E. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This fragment has previously been shown to direct high levels of matrix-induced transcription in MC3T3-E1 cells when positioned downstream of a bone-specific enhancer. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing wild type and mutant A, B, and C elements from the Bsppromoter (see Table I) were synthesized by the University of Michigan Core Facilities. They were then self-ligated and inserted into theBglII site of both p49BSP and p34OG2 in order to compare the enhancer activities of the Bsp sites with those of the minimal promoters alone. A, B, or C element sequences were deleted from the 705-base pair promoter to create p705ΔA, p705ΔB, and p705ΔC as follows: primer pGL3(–), which anneals to the antisense strand of the vector immediately 3′ of the pGL3Basic multiple cloning site, was used in conjunction with BglII linker primers –253(+), –226(+), and –180(+) to amplify three different length fragments by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Taq polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). These fragments were ligated into the BglII and HindIII sites of pGL3Basic. Primers –279(–), A(–), and B(–) were then used with primer pGL3(+), a KpnI linker primer that anneals to the antisense strand of the plasmid upstream of the multiple cloning site, to create PCR fragments representing the upstream segments of the final constructs. These fragments were blunted with Klenow, digested withKpnI, and ligated into the KpnI andSmaI sites of the plasmids, which already harbored the downstream PCR fragments described. The resulting Bspreporter constructs are missing 26, 30, and 50 bp of Bspsequence for A, B, and C deletions, respectively, which is replaced with cloning site sequence for net total deletions of 8, 13, and 33 bp. These constructs are graphically depicted in Fig. 5 A. The sequences of the primers used in their construction are given in TableI. These internal deletion constructs were transfected into clone 4 and UMR 106-01 cells under the conditions described above in order to assess the effect on promoter activity of deletion of these elements in the context of the 705 base pair Bsp promoter. To create the probe plasmid pBSPfp1, harboring the insert used as a probe in our footprinting studies, we used linker primers –369(+) and –165(–) (see Table I) to PCR amplify a Bsp promoter fragment, which we then ligated into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Creation of p2472mut3, containing the 2472-bp Bsp promoter with a 2-bp mutation in the C element sequence, was accomplished as follows: primers Cmut3SD(+) and (–) (Table I) were used with Stratagene's Quick-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions to introduce the desired mutation into p2472. AnEcoRV/XhoI fragment containing Bsppromoter sequence from –1016 to +41 was then isolated from the mutagenized plasmid and ligated into the corresponding position in the unmutagenized p2472 plasmid. This strategy was used so that the resultant construct contained a much shorter length of in vitro polymerized sequence that would have to undergo confirmatory sequencing. The sequences of all in vitro synthesized constructs were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing using a Sequenase 2.0 kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The pcDNA3-Dlx5 expression plasmid was the generous gift of Dr. Dwight Towler (Merck, Inc., West Point, PA) and contains a sequence that encodes a FLAG epitope tag 5′ to codon 2 of a murine Dlx5 cDNA, resulting in the production of an N-terminal “FLAG-tagged” protein (23.Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Towler D.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16360-16368Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). pCMV5-β-gal was created by ligating a bacterial lacZ cDNA from pRSVβ-gal (a gift from Dr. Daniel Wechsler, University of Michigan) into the EcoRI site of pCMV5 (Sigma).Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyOligo nameSequenceAGATCCTTTGCTATTTATTTTATTTGAAGAAAACGATAAATAAAATAAACTTCTAGBGATCCAGTATATTATTATATATATTCAGTCATATAATAATATATATAAGTCTAGCaThe sequences of the C mutant oligonucleotides used in this study are the same as those of the wild type shown here except for the two base pair changes shown in Fig. 6 A.GATCCTCCTCACCCTTCAATTAAATCCCACAAGAGGAGTGGGAAGTTAATTTAGGGTGTTCTAG−369(+)TATGAATTCACTTTAGACCCCATGCAGTG−253(+)TATGGATCCGCAGTATATTATTATATATATTCAGAACTC−226(+)TATGGATCCCTCTAACTACCATCTTCTCC−180(+)TATGGATCCCAAGCCTCTTGGCAGAAGG−279(−)GATCGACTTAAGCATTTAAGCTTTC−165(−)TATGGATCCCAAGAGGCTTGCATTGTGGpGL3(+)TATGGTACCTGCCAGAACATTTCTCTATCGpGL3(−)ATGCCAAGCTTACTTAGATCGCmut3SDbThe two base pairs that differ from the wild type BSP sequence are shown in boldface.CCATCTTCTCCTCACCCTTCCCTTAAATCCCACAATGCAAGGGTAGAAGAGGAGTGGGAAGGGAATTTAGGGTGTTACGTTCa The sequences of the C mutant oligonucleotides used in this study are the same as those of the wild type shown here except for the two base pair changes shown in Fig. 6 A.b The two base pairs that differ from the wild type BSP sequence are shown in boldface. Open table in a new tab Total RNA from cells subjected to differentiation treatments as described above was isolated by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (24.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Analytical Biochemistry. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63139) Google Scholar). 10 μg aliquots were fractionated on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels and blotted to nylon membranes as described previously (25.Thomas P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5201-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (5859) Google Scholar). The mouse BSP cDNA insert used as probe was isolated from a plasmid obtained from Dr. Marion Young (NIDCR, National Institutes of Health) (26.Young M.F. Ibaraki K. Kerr J.M. Lyu M.S. Kozak C.A. Mamm. Genome. 1994; 5: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The Dlx5 cDNA was obtained from Dr. Steven Harris (University of Texas Health Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX). Both were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primer kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and incubated with the membranes in a Bellco Autoblot hybridization oven as described previously (27.Franceschi R.T. Iyer B.S. Cui Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The washed membranes were then exposed to Kodak X-omat AR film at –70 °C. Nuclear extracts were prepared after the method of Dignam et al. (28.Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar) from cells grown under differentiation conditions. Additionally, nuclei from ascorbic acid-treated clone 4 cells were isolated from the collagenous matrix by treatment with 2 mg/ml collagenase A (Sigma) and 0.25% trypsin (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h followed by exhaustive rinsing in cold phosphate-buffered saline before continuing with the extraction of nuclear proteins. Footprinting assays were performed as follows: 5 μg of probe plasmid was digested with either BamHI (to label the positive strand) or EcoRI (to label the negative strand). The cut linearized plasmid was then treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase, and digested with either EcoRI or BamHI. The released insert was then purified from a 5% acrylamide gel, and its activity was quantitated with a scintillation counter. 15,000 cpm of these probes and 0, 25, 50, or 75 μg of nuclear extract were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in a 100-μl reaction volume containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol, with 5 μg of poly(dI·dC). An equal volume of a 2.5 mmCaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2 solution was added, and the reactions were digested with 1.2 units of RNase free DNase I (Promega) for 60 s at room temperature. Digestion was stopped by the addition of 180 μl of stop solution (200 mm NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA), followed by extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) equilibrated with TEB (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The samples were precipitated with 1 ml of ethanol, rinsed twice with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 5 μl of loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol). After heating for 5 min at 95 °C, the samples were then electrophoresed on a sequencing gel of 8% acrylamide (19:1 with bis-acrylamide) in 1× TBE at 60 W. The gels were dried and exposed to Kodak BioMax film at −70 °C. In order to determine positions of the protected nucleotides in these assays, the samples were run alongside aliquots of the same probes subjected to chemical sequencing reactions after the method of Maxam and Gilbert (29.Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (5439) Google Scholar). Gel shift probe was made by labeling 1.5 pmol of double-stranded C oligonucleotide (shown in TableI) with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 kinase; filling in with Klenow, cold G, A, and T nucleotides, and [α-32P]dCTP; and purifying the labeled oligo on a 5% acrylamide gel. Gel mobility shift assays were performed by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min of 5 μg of nuclear extract with approximately 5 fmol of probe in a 15-μl reaction containing 2 μl of poly(dI·dC) in the same binding buffer that was used in the footprinting assays described above. For experiments including antibody, samples were then incubated for an additional 30 min with either 4 μg of anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Stratagene) or IgG as control (Life Technologies) and, in some cases, 100 ng of FLAG peptide (Sigma). The shifted complexes were then electrophoresed on 5% acrylamide gels in 1× TGE (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 380 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 120 min at 170 V in a 4 °C cold room. Gels were dried and exposed to BioMax film. In order to identify tissue-specific elements in the BSP promoter, we employed a construct containing bases –2472 to +41 of the murine gene driving expression of a luciferase reporter gene. Our decision to focus on this region was based on previous work which demonstrated that this construct was able to direct 5–10-fold higher levels of expression in osteoblastic cells than in nonbone cell lines (6.Benson M.D. Aubin J.E. Xiao G. Thomas P.E. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), indicating that this fragment of the promoter likely contains sequence elements necessary to direct tissue-specific BSP expression. This finding is in agreement with data reported by Chen et al. (30.Chen J. Thomas H.F. Jin H. Jiang H. Sodek J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 654-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which showed mineralized tissue-restricted expression of a similar region of the rat BSP promoter in transgenic mice. As a prelude to a detailed analysis of the sequence elements responsible for this selective expression, a more thorough characterization of the expression of this reporter construct was performed in various osteoblastic cell lines to determine whether its regulation pattern parallels that of the endogenous BSP message. The murine MC3T3-E1 preosteoblastic cell line produces high levels of bone-related proteins, including BSP, in response to induction of collagen matrix synthesis by ascorbic acid (31.Franceschi R.T. Iyer B.S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). For our studies, we employed a subclone, clone 4, which gives higher levels of bone marker transcription than the more heterogeneous parent cell line (15.Xiao G. Cui Y. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Upon transfection with the p2472 construct, and treatment with ascorbic acid over a 7-day time course, clone 4 cells showed a significant induction in reporter activity—up to 40-fold over that in nontreated cells by day 7—that paralleled the increase in endogenous BSP message (Fig.1, A and B). By way of comparison, ROS 17/2.8 osteosarcoma cells, which express high levels of osteocalcin but not of BSP (Fig. 1 C), exhibited only 20% of the luciferase activity seen in clone 4 cells when transfected with the p2472 construct, comparable to those seen in C2C12 myoblasts and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, two mesenchymal cell lines that do not express BSP (Fig. 1 D). However, UMR 106-01 osteosarcoma cells, which constitutively express high levels of BSP (16.Midura R.J. McQuillan D.J. Benham K.J. Fisher L.W. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5285-5291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), showed levels of expression of the transfected construct that are comparable to those in clone 4 cells (Fig. 2). Thus, the 2472-bp murine Bsp promoter is expressed at high levels only in cells that produce BSP and in a pattern that mirrors that of the endogenous message.Figure 25′-Deletion analysis of the Bsppromoter. ExoIII deletion of the p2472 construct yielded the set of 5′-deletions of the murine Bsp promoter shown. These deletion constructs were transfected into clone 4, UMR 106-01, C2C12, 3T3-L1, F9, and S194 cells and grown under differentiation conditions. Firefly luciferase activities were assayed and normalized to Renilla luciferase and are shown as a percentage of the activity of the full-length construct in clone 4 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We created a series of 5′-deletions of the 2472-bp promoter construct in order to isolate regions of the fragment responsible for its osteoblast selective expression. These deletions were transfected into osteoblastic cell lines (MC3T3-E1 and UMR 106-01) and nonbone cells (C2C12 myoblasts, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, F9 teratocarcinoma, and S194 lymphocytes) and grown under conditions that induced differentiation appropriate for each cell type (osteoblast, muscle, adipose, endoderm, and B lymphocyte, respectively; see under “Experimental Procedures”). The object of these treatments was to approximate a panel of different tissue types in cell culture so as to examine the tissue selectivity of the transfected Bsppromoter constructs. The results of these transfections, shown in Fig.2, revealed three major features. (i) Deletion of the promoter sequence from –2472 to –178 caused no change in activity in the nonbone cell lines, whereas further deletion to –49 resulted in a drastic loss of activity in all cell lines. This likely means that the region from –49 to –178 contains sequences required for basal, non-tissue-specific transcription. (ii) Deletion from –2472 to –338 reduced promoter activity in clone 4 cells by approximately 60% but caused only a slight drop in UMR 106-01 cells. This segment may contain regulatory sequences that are required for high level transcription in the MC3T3-E1 cell line but not in the tumor-derived UMR line. (iii) Deletion of sequences from –338 to –178 resulted in a loss of over half of the remaining activity in both clone 4 and UMR lines. This represents the most severe drop in activity to that point and brings the activity in these cells down to that seen in the nonosteoblastic cell lines, indicating that the region from –338 to –178 most likely contains elements crucial to the bone-selective expression of the promoter.

The α1(XV) chain contains a highly interrupted collagenous region of 577 residues, and noncollagenous amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of 530 and 256 residues, respectively. Cysteines are present in each domain and consensus sequences forO-linked glycosaminoglycans are situated in the amino terminus and in two large, noncollagenous interruptions. We now report that type XV collagen is a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan in human tissues and cultured cells, and that the α chains are covalently linked by interchain disulfide bonds only between the two cysteines in the collagenous region. Western blotting of tissue extracts revealed a diffuse smear with a mean size ≥400 kDa, which after chondroitinase digestion resolved into a 250-kDa band in umbilical cord, and 250- and 225-kDa bands in placenta, lung, colon, and skeletal muscle. The latter two bands were also directly visualized by alcian blue/silver staining of a purified placenta extract. In a human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, almost all of the newly synthesized type XV collagen was secreted into the medium and upon chondroitinase digestion just the 250-kDa α chain was generated. Chondroitinase plus collagenase digestion of tissue and medium proteins followed by Western blotting using domain-specific antibodies revealed a 135-kDa amino-terminal fragment containing glycosaminoglycan chains and a 27-kDa fragment representing the intact carboxyl terminus. However, a truncated carboxyl peptide of ∼8-kDa was also evident in tissue extracts containing the 225-kDa form. Our data suggest that the 225-kDa form arises from differential carboxyl cleavage of the 250-kDa form, and could explain the ∼19-kDa endostatin-related fragments (John, H., Preissner, K.

Type XV and XVIII, but not type XIX, collagens were also shown to exhibit major similarities by primary structure alignment. Comparison of domain arrangement, restricted sequence homology, as well as intron/exon organization indicated that α1(XV) and α1(XVIII) evolved from a common ancestral gene (4.Oh S.P. Kamagata Y.

Both collagens, but especially type XV, contain extensive interruptions in their collagenous regions such that the majority of the residues in each chain are found within the amino- and carboxyl-terminal noncollagenous domains. In particular, the carboxyl-terminal domain of type XVIII collagen has become a focal point in tumor biology upon finding that the terminal 20-kDa fragment is identical to the potent anti-angiogenic factor, endostatin (17.O'Reilly M.S.

Pursuant to this discovery is more current research in which the analogous peptide of type XV collagen, displaying by far the highest degree of sequence conservation with type XVIII, is being investigated for related properties (18.Ramchandran R.

Another parallel between types XV and XVIII collagen can be drawn by comparing their noncollagenous amino-terminal domains. Among the common features are a number of consensus sequences for attachment ofO-linked glycosaminoglycans (4.Oh S.P. Kamagata Y. Muragaki Y. Timmons S. Ooshima A. Olsen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4229-4233Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 5.Rehn M. Pihlajaniemi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has since been described that α1(XVIII) chains are sensitive to heparitinase, but not to chondroitinase ABC digestion (12.Halfter W. Dong S. Schurer B. Cole G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25404-25412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Thus, type XVIII collagen is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan with a core protein with molecular mass of 180 kDa. The first immunochemical studies of type XV collagen to determine its tissue distribution were reported using antibodies directed at the carboxyl terminus of the protein (9.Myers J.C. Dion A.S. Abraham V. Amenta P.S. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 286: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In human placenta and colon tissue extracts, our antibody, derived from a recombinant protein antigen, recognized a 116-kDa collagenase-sensitive protein and a 27-kDa collagenase-resistant fragment (9.Myers J.C. Dion A.S. Abraham V. Amenta P.S. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 286: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The latter was in accord with the size expected for the 256-residue carboxyl terminus, whereas the former appeared considerably smaller than would be predicted for the 1388-residue intact protein. In a separate analysis, other investigators showed that their type XV antibody, generated from a synthetic carboxyl peptide, reacted with a 110-kDa band in human heart extract and with 110- and 70-kDa bands in kidney samples (10.Hägg P.M. Hägg P.O. Peltonen S. Autio-Harmainen H. Pihlajaniemi T. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 2075-2086PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent use of antibodies from both sources, however, revealed a similar pattern of BMZ localization (9.Myers J.C. Dion A.S. Abraham V. Amenta P.S. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 286: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 10.Hägg P.M. Hägg P.O. Peltonen S. Autio-Harmainen H. Pihlajaniemi T. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 2075-2086PubMed Google Scholar). To conduct a comprehensive biochemical characterization of type XV collagen, we embarked upon a series of purification steps beginning with human placenta tissue. Type XV was identified using both carboxyl-terminal antibodies and a new antibody prepared against a peptide sequence located in the amino-terminal noncollagenous domain. The results presented here surprisingly show that type XV collagen exists as a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan in the five human tissues examined. In four of these tissues, type XV is present as 250- and 225-kDa core protein forms, which differ at their carboxyl terminus.In vitro studies of type XV production in cultured human cells showed that almost all of the newly synthesized collagen is secreted into the medium, consists of only the 250-kDa core protein form, and is modified by the addition of chondroitin sulfate chains. Further analysis of type XV collagen by differential use of the domain-specific antibodies revealed that the trimer is linked by interchain disulfide bonds and these involve only two of the eight cysteines in the molecule. Taken together, our data provide crucial new insight into the structure and expression of this complex BMZ collagen. Preparation of the type XV collagen recombinant protein (corresponding to the first 120 residues of the noncollagenous carboxyl-terminal domain) and the original type XV-COOH antibody (COOH-Ab) have been described previously (9.Myers J.C. Dion A.S. Abraham V. Amenta P.S. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 286: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Sera from the three additional rabbits injected (Berkeley Antibody Co., Richmond, CA) with the carboxyl recombinant protein (500 μg/rabbit) were precipitated by addition of 50% saturated ammonium sulfate, dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and affinity-purified using Affi-Gel 10 resin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). The type XV NH2-antibody (NH2-Ab) was prepared using a 15-amino acid peptide (GPGDEEDLAAATTEE) synthesized by the Protein Chemistry Laboratory of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. The peptide was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected into two rabbits. Serum was affinity-purified as above using Affi-Gel 15 resin. The CCL136 human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells in T75 flasks were grown for 2 days in RPMI medium 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) to 90% confluence and used to seed five T75 flasks at a density of ∼7.5 × 106 cells/flask (∼100,000 cells/cm2) in growth medium pre-equilibrated in the CO2 incubator. After 22 h, the cells at ∼75% confluence were washed twice with medium to remove the serum, and were then incubated in medium containing 0.1% serum and 50 μg/ml ascorbate. The following day, the cultures had reached ∼90% confluence. Ascorbate was again added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml (to the preexisting medium), and cultures were maintained for an additional 20 h. The respective media and cell layer/matrix fractions from the five flasks were pooled and processed as described in the following section. Medium from the cultures (10 ml/flask) was quick-chilled in an ice slurry and adjusted to a final concentration of 5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). The medium was clarified for 10 min at 7500 × g and concentrated 25–35 fold at 2800 × g at 4 °C using Centriplus XM-100 filters (Amicon/Millipore). Preparation of cell/matrix samples has been described previously (20.Myers J.C. Li D. Rubinstein N.A. Clark C.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 587-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cell/matrix and medium samples were aliquoted in small volumes, quick-frozen, and stored at −75 °C. Normal human tissue samples, obtained from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and the Cooperative Human Tissue Network, were frozen at −75 °C or in liquid nitrogen, normally within 60 min after excision. Tissue (∼0.25–0.5 g) was homogenized for 5 × 1 min at 30,000 rpm in an ice-chilled buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm PMSF, 22 mm NEM, 0.0162 trypsin inhibitor units/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. The mixture was placed on a rocker platform at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 1500 ×g. Small aliquots of the supernatant were stored at −75 °C. Fresh human placenta (60 g wet weight) was washed several times in sterile ice-chilled 50 mm Tris-HCl, 4.5 m NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, 1 mm PMSF, 2 mmNEM, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A and stored at −75 °C. Frozen tissue was ground to a powder in a mortar and pestle chilled in liquid nitrogen. The tissue powder was added to a urea-containing extraction buffer in a 5–10:1 (v/w) ratio of buffer to tissue under non-reducing conditions. The buffer consisted of 7 m urea, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 2% CHAPS (Sigma) (21.Byers S. Hopkins T.J. Kuettner K.E. Kimura J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9166-9174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the protease inhibitors 100 mmε-amino-n-caproic acid, 10 mm NEM, and 1 mm PMSF. (Extraction in 4 m guanidine HCl, pH 5.8, buffer was equally effective.) The tissue suspension was stirred at 4 °C for 24 h and centrifuged at 32,000 × gfor 20 min. The solubilized protein (100 mg) was incubated with 15 ml of Q-Sepharose Fast Flow resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated in 7 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, plus the above protease inhibitors. The sample was incubated with the resin on a rocker overnight at 4 °C. The suspension was centrifuged at 480 × g and the resin washed first with binding buffer containing 0.2% CHAPS; second, with the same buffer containing 0.5m NaCl; and third, with the same buffer containing 1m NaCl. To measure what remained bound, an aliquot of the resin was subsequently boiled in SDS-polyacrylamide gel buffer. All fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. Type XV collagen eluted in 1 m NaCl buffer and was concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centriplus XM-100 filters. The concentrated sample was brought to a final concentration of 100 mm DTT and applied to a 1 × 115-cm column of Sephacryl S-500 Superfine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25m sodium sulfate, 20 mm EDTA, and 4m guanidine HCl (22.Clark C.C. Richards C.F. Pacifici M. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10229-10238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions were eluted and assayed by dot-blot screening, and the peak fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Bacterial collagenase (Advance Biofactures, Lynbrook, NY) digestions have been described previously (7.Myers J.C. Li D. Bageris A. Abraham V. Dion A.S. Amenta P.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1729-1740PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Myers J.C. Dion A.S. Abraham V. Amenta P.S. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 286: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Chondroitinase ABC, protease-free (Proteus vulgaris) and heparitinase (Flavobacterium heparinum) were purchased from Seikagaku Corp. (Rockville, MD). Chondroitinase digestions (15 μl) were performed for 90 min at 37 °C in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 30 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 8.0, using 20 milliunits of enzyme. In those reactions where collagenase digestion was sequentially performed, 4 μl of 50 mm calcium acetate was added, followed by 3 μl (3 units) of bacterial collagenase. Reactions were then incubated for another 60 min at 37 °C. Heparitinase digestions (15 μl) were carried out for 90 min at 37 °C in a pH 7.0 buffer consisting of 100 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm calcium acetate, using 5 milliunits of enzyme. In those reactions where bacterial collagenase digestion was sequentially performed, 4 μl of 5× collagenase buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 50 mm calcium acetate) was added, followed by 3 μl (3 units) of bacterial collagenase. Reactions were then incubated for another 60 min at 37 °C. In all procedures, the control digestion(s), indicated in the specific figure legend, was incubated in the identical buffer and for the identical time and temperature except without the respective enzyme(s). Proteins were transferred from 5–12% polyacrylamide-SDS gels (acrylamide concentrations are specified in the figures and figure legends) to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Marlborough, MA) as described previously (7.Myers J.C. Li D. Bageris A. Abraham V. Dion A.S. Amenta P.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1729-1740PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Myers J.C. Dion A.S. Abraham V. Amenta P.S. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 286: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the one instance where the 18% polyacrylamide-Tricine gel was used, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-PSQ (Millipore) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 37.5% methanol for 90 min at 65 V. Secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase -linked donkey anti-rabbit Ig (whole antibody or F(ab′)2fragment), obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, were used at 1:18,000 or 1:2500 dilutions, respectively. Primary antibodies were used at dilutions of 1:500 to 1:2000. The procedure was modified from the 20 steps listed in the published report (23.Møller H.J. Heinegård D. Poulsen J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The major differences involved changes in the following steps (S): S1, overnight; S4, 45 min; S5–S7 10 min each; S8 and S9, 1 h each (or until the background cleared); S10, 10 min; S15, 20 min. Additionally, S15 to S20 were conducted at room temperature. Following preparation of our initial type XV antibody (9.Myers J.C. Dion A.S. Abraham V. Amenta P.S. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 286: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), three additional carboxyl-derived antibodies (COOH-Abs) were generated using the same recombinant protein as antigen. Immunostaining of human tissues using the new type XV antibodies (7.Myers J.C. Li D. Bageris A. Abraham V. Dion A.S. Amenta P.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1729-1740PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Amenta P.S. Briggs K. Xu K. Gamboa E. Jukkola A.F. Li D. Myers J.C. Hum.

Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 286: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis using these COOH-Abs was consistent except in one respect. Only the original type XV COOH-Ab, prepared from the early bleeds of one rabbit, reacted with a 116-kDa collagenase-sensitive protein 2Because later bleeds from this rabbit did not detect the 116-kDa protein and supplies of earlier bleeds have been exhausted, we have no further information on the origin of this protein. found in extracts from several human tissues (9.Myers J.C. Dion A.S. Abraham V. Amenta P.S. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 286: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, all four type XV COOH-Abs identified a 27-kDa collagenase-resistant fragment (Fig. 1,lane 2, and Ref. 9.Myers J.C. Dion A.S. Abraham V. Amenta P.S. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 286: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which was the size expected for the 256-residue carboxyl-terminal noncollagenous domain (see Fig.9). In addition, all four COOH-Abs reacted with very high molecular mass, collagenase-sensitive material, which remained in a 5% stacking gel of an 8% separating gel (used in prior SDS-PAGE, Ref. 9.Myers J.C. Dion A.S. Abraham V. Amenta P.S. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 286: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), but which appeared as a diffuse area ≥400 kDa upon migration through a 3% stacking gel into a 5% separating gel (Fig.1, lane 3).Figure 9Schematic diagram showing major structural features of the mature human type XV collagen chain, the epitopes for the NH2- and COOH-Abs, and the location of the multiple polypeptide forms and bacterial collagenase cleavage fragments.The three domains of type XV collagen are drawn proportional to their size. The amino terminus (diagonal stripes) contains 530 residues, the discontinuous collagenous region (white and gray areas) encompasses 577 residues, and the carboxyl terminus (dotted pattern) includes 256 residues (3.Myers J.C.

Potential O-linked GAG attachment sequences (D/E-X 1–2-S-G/A: eight in the amino terminus and four in the interruptions) are designated byvertical ball and stick symbols. C = cysteines: two in the amino-terminal domain, two in the collagenous region, and four in the carboxyl-terminal domain. The two cysteines in the collagenous region that are predicted to be involved in interchain disulfide bonds are tagged with an asterisk. The heavy black lines, drawn above the type XV map, show the location of amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences used to prepare the synthetic peptide and recombinant protein antigens for production of the NH2- and COOH-Abs, respectively. The predicted positions of the 250- and 225-kDa forms, and the collagenase-resistant fragments consisting of the 135-kDa amino-terminal domain and the 27- and 8-kDa carboxyl fragments are designated. The internal boundaries of the 135-, 27-, and 8-kDa fragments coincide with the positions of the nearest recognition sites for bacterial collagenase (G-P-Y↓G-P) (48.Peterkofsky B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82A: 453-471Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Note that molecular mass values of the 250-, 225-, and 135-kDa forms have been derived only from polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of chondroitinase-treated samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To address the questions presented by these different protein forms, a peptide sequence in the type XV amino terminus was targeted for preparation of another polyclonal antibody (see Fig. 9 and “Materials and Methods”). By immunohistochemistry, this purified antibody (NH2-Ab) showed the same BMZ staining as the COOH-Abs (24.Amenta P.S. Briggs K. Xu K. Gamboa E. Jukkola A.F. Li D. Myers J.C. Hum. Pathol. 2000; 31: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In Western blot analyses of untreated placenta extracts, the NH2-Ab reacted minimally with the high molecular mass collagenase-sensitive form identified with the COOH-Ab. After collagenase treatment, however, there was no evidence of any size cleavage fragment (expected to be ≥50 kDa, see Fig. 9) corresponding to the type XV amino-terminal domain (data not shown). It therefore appeared that purification steps would be required to further characterize the type XV protein. To this end, fresh frozen placenta was pulverized in liquid nitrogen, and the protein extracted in a 7 m urea buffer under non-reducing conditions (see “Materials and Methods”). Following centrifugation, the solubilized protein was bound to Q-Sepharose and eluted stepwise using increasing concentrations of NaCl. As shown in Fig.2 A, Western blot analysis of the various fractions using the collagenase-resistant, 27-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment as a marker (9.Myers J.C. Dion A.S. Abraham V. Amenta P.S. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 286: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), showed that all of the type XV collagen bound to the resin and little was removed in subsequent washing steps using the binding buffer. The protein remained strongly bound in 0.5 m NaCl, but completely eluted at 1m NaCl (Fig. 2 A, lanes 6 and7). The type XV collagen-containing protein pool was concentrated by ultrafiltration and applied to a Sephacryl S-500 gel filtration column under denaturing and disulfide bond-reducing conditions. Dot-blot screening of all fractions showed that the α1(XV) chain eluted in a broad peak with an apparent mass of 300–400 kDa (data not shown). The above concentrated pool, examined by Western blotting using the COOH-Ab, showed the expected 27-kDa collagenase-resistant fragment after digestion (Fig. 2 B, lane 2).

One major central input to this structure originates from brainstem cells in the paramedian tract (PMT), whose function is unknown. Here it is reported that PMT cells in the pons carry vestibular and eye movement signals and their pharmacological inactivation produces a leaky integrator combined with vestibular imbalance. The results suggest that PMT cells provide the cerebellum with sensory and motor signals that are essential for velocity-to-position integration, a common premotor process that is required in all motor systems."
https://openalex.org/W2146780090,"Locus control regions (LCRs) are capable of activating target genes over substantial distances and establishing autonomously regulated chromatin domains. The basis for this action is poorly defined. Human growth hormone gene (hGH-N) expression is activated by an LCR marked by a series of DNase I-hypersensitive sites (HSI-III and HSV) in pituitary chromatin. These HSs are located between -15 and -32 kilobases (kb) relative to the hGH transcription start site. To establish a mechanistic basis for hGH LCR function, we carried out acetylation mapping of core histones H3 and H4 in chromatin encompassing the hGH cluster. These studies revealed that the entire LCR was selectively enriched for acetylation in chromatin isolated from a human pituitary somatotrope adenoma and in pituitaries of mice transgenic for the hGH locus, but not in hepatic or erythroid cells. Quantification of histone modification in the pituitary revealed a dramatic peak at HSI/II, the major pituitary-specific hGH LCR determinant (-15 kb), with gradually decreasing levels of modification extending from this site in both 5'- and 3'-directions. The 5'-border of the acetylated domain coincided with the 5' most hGH LCR element, HSV (-34 kb); and the 3'-border included the expressed hGH-N gene, but did not extend farther 3' into the placenta-specific region of the gene cluster. These data support a model of LCR function involving targeted recruitment and subsequent spreading of histone acetyltransferase activity to encompass and activate a remote target gene."

https://openalex.org/W2065628921,"To study the mechanism of transcriptional activation of the Xenopus homeobox geneXvent-2B, we have delineated the bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP-4)-responsive region between −275/−152 in the proximal promoter. Consistent with the BMP-4 inductive nature of this region, this element exhibits transcriptional activation upon ectopic expression of Smad1 and Smad4. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with total cellular extracts demonstrated that a DNA fragment encompassing this region was competent in the formation of a BMP-4-induced protein-DNA complex containing Smad1. Two different Smad binding regions were localized, a distal binding region for Smad1 containing two GCAT motifs and proximal AGNC binding sites for Smad4, the latter being conserved in other transforming growth factor-β-responsive elements. Mutation of the Smad4 binding motif completely abolished transcriptional activation, whereas mutation or deletion of the Smad1 recognition sequence inhibited Smad1/Smad4 responsiveness. These results provide a functional characterization and identification of a vertebrate Smad1/Smad4 DNA response element induced by BMP-4 signaling and offers insight into the transcriptional regulation of a component essential for dorsoventral patterning inXenopus embryos.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with total cellular extracts demonstrated that a DNA fragment encompassing this region was competent in the formation of a BMP-4-induced protein-DNA complex containing Smad1. Two different Smad binding regions were localized, a distal binding region for Smad1 containing two GCAT motifs and proximal AGNC binding sites for Smad4, the latter being conserved in other transforming growth factor-β-responsive elements. Mutation of the Smad4 binding motif completely abolished transcriptional activation, whereas mutation or deletion of the Smad1 recognition sequence inhibited Smad1/Smad4 responsiveness. These results provide a functional characterization and identification of a vertebrate Smad1/Smad4 DNA response element induced by BMP-4 signaling and offers insight into the transcriptional regulation of a component essential for dorsoventral patterning inXenopus embryos. transforming growth factor-β bone morphogenetic protein Mad homology Smad binding element BMP response element electrophoretic mobility shift assay nitrilotriacetic acid The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)1 superfamily is a conserved class of cell-cell-signaling molecules implicated in the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation. Throughout induction and patterning of the amphibian mesoderm, multiple TGF-β-signaling molecules are present, including bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), which have been shown to promote the formation and patterning of ventral mesoderm (1.Hogan B.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar).Intracellularly, BMP-4 signals are transduced to the nucleus from heteromeric-coupled serine-threonine kinase receptors by an evolutionary-conserved family of Smad proteins (2.Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar, 3.Whitman M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2445-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Most members can be classified into three groups based on both sequence homology and biological activity: receptor specific Smads, common mediator Smads, and inhibitory Smads. All members consist of two highly conserved domains in the amino and carboxyl terminus, denoted the MH1 and MH2 domains, respectively, separated by a proline-rich region of variable sequence and length.Ligand binding to TGF-β receptors stimulates the association and phosphorylation of the receptor-specific Smad on carboxyl-terminal serine residues in the carboxyl-terminal SSXS motif. Smad1, Smad5, and most likely Smad8 are substrates for BMP receptors, whereas Smad2 and Smad3 are mediators of TGF-β and activin/Vg1 signaling. Functional differences between the receptor-specific Smads are best observed in Xenopus embryos, where ectopic expression of Smad1 and Smad5 mimic BMP-4 induction of ventral mesoderm (4.Suzuki A. Chang C. Yingling J.M. Wang X.F. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Dev. Biol. 1997; 184: 402-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 5.Wilson P.A. Lagna G. Suzuki A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Development. 1997; 124: 3177-3184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Smad2 induces dorsalization of mesoderm and formation of a secondary axis in a fashion similar to activin A (6.Baker J.C.

Cell. 1996; 85: 479-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Following phosphorylation, the receptor-specific Smads hetero-oligomerize with Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus, where they regulate the expression of specific genes.Accumulating evidence suggests that the Smads directly participate in transcriptional complexes that elicit the effects of their corresponding ligands. First, the Smad proteins have an intrinsic transcriptional activation domain located in their carboxyl termini that is revealed upon fusion of this domain to a heterologous DNA binding motif (8.Liu F.

Second, the Smads associate and cooperate functionally with several well characterized transcription factors such as Sp1 (10.Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Additionally, the MH1 domain of Mad, theDrosophila homologue of Smad1, was found to bind Dpp-responsive elements in the vestigial (vg) (29.Kim J. Johnson K. Chen H.J. Carroll S. Laughon A.

Moreover,Caenorhabditis elegans DAF-3 was reported to associate directly to elements within the C subelement ofmyo-2 (32.Thatcher J.D. Haun C. Okkema P.G. Development. 1999; 126: 97-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the other receptor-specific Smads, Smad2 does not directly bind to DNA and has been shown to require the participation of FAST-1 as an adapter DNA-binding protein (33.Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar).The framework of the molecular mechanism by which Smads activate their target genes has been elucidated through the use of a limited set of TGF-β-, activin-, and Dpp-responsive genes. Further investigation of the regulation of other TGF-β early response genes should provide additional insight into the cellular response of these ligands. Of particular interest are BMP targets, which are poorly characterized. The Xvent homeobox genes have been shown to mediate BMP-4 signaling including dorsoventral patterning of the Xenopus mesoderm. This family of transcription factors can be divided into two subgroups, the first containing Xvent-1, PV.1, and Xvent-1B (34.Gawantka V. Delius H. Hirschfeld K. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6268-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 35.Ault K.T. Dirksen M.-L. Jamrich M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Dev. 1999; 81: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and the second containing Xvent-2, Xom, Xbr-1, Vox, and Xvent-2B (36.Rastegar S. Friedle H. Frommer G. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 37.Ladher R. Mohun T.J. Smith J.C. Snape A.M. Development. 1996; 122: 2385-2394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Onichtchouk D.

Biol. 1996; 174: 104-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 40.Schmidt J.E. von Dassow G. Kimelman D. Development. 1996; 122: 1711-1721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been established that the Xvent-2family, in contrast to Xvent-1, is a direct target of BMP-4 signaling (36.Rastegar S. Friedle H. Frommer G. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As such, the expression patterns of Xvent-2 and BMP-4 are almost identical, and overexpression of Xvent-2 in the intact embryo mimics the ventralizing effects of BMP-4.In this study, we have identified a BMP-4 response region in theXvent-2B promoter between −275 and −152. This element is sufficient to confer BMP-4 responsiveness of a reporter as demonstrated by the strong transcriptional activation upon ectopic expression of BMP-4 or co-expression of Smad1 together with Smad4. Furthermore, this region was competent in the formation of a BMP-4-induced protein-DNA complex, which contained Smad1. In vitro binding studies demonstrated that Smad1 and Smad4 are capable of direct binding to this target sequence in two discrete regions. Modification of the Smad4 binding site by mutation was sufficient to abolish transcriptional activation of the Xvent-2B promoter. We also identify for the first time a Smad1 target sequence in a BMP-4 response element. Binding by Smad1 was found to require a GCAT sequence flanked by AT-rich regions. Mutation or deletion of these Smad1 binding sites also disrupted transcriptional activation, further underscoring the role of the identified elements and Smad1/Smad4 in Xvent-2Bregulation.DISCUSSIONBMP-4 plays an essential role in vertebrate embryogenesis, where it promotes the patterning of ventral mesoderm. Of its downstream targets in Xenopus laevis, the Xvent-2 family is of high interest because it has been shown to be an immediate response gene of BMP-4 signaling (36.Rastegar S. Friedle H. Frommer G. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 37.Ladher R. Mohun T.J. Smith J.C. Snape A.M. Development. 1996; 122: 2385-2394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of Xvent-2 members affords the same ventralized phenotype as observed with BMP-4. Furthermore, Xvent-2 can rescue the majority of effects induced by the dominant negative type I BMP receptor, suggesting it is a central mediator of BMP signaling (36.Rastegar S. Friedle H. Frommer G. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 37.Ladher R. Mohun T.J. Smith J.C. Snape A.M. Development. 1996; 122: 2385-2394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Onichtchouk D. Gawantka V. Dosch R. Delius H. Hirschfeld K. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Development. 1996; 122: 3045-3053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Papalopulu N. Kintner C. Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 104-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 40.Schmidt J.E. von Dassow G.

The requirement for Xvent-2 function in dorsoventral patterning was further demonstrated through the use of dominant negative constructs (46.Onichtchouk D. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Development. 1998; 125: 1447-1456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Investigation of the molecular mechanism by which BMP-4 activates Xvent-2 not only provides insight into the patterning in embryogenesis but can also be used to further deduce the manner in which TGF-β family members exert their discrete cellular responses.Although promoter/enhancer elements that respond directly to TGF-β, activin, and Dpp have been characterized for several genes, studies of an element that exhibits an exclusive BMP-4-induced transcriptional activation are limited. A recent study of the Xvent-2promoter using cell transfection experiments identified a 53-base pair region in the Xvent-2 promoter that responds to BMP (47.Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Presently, through the use of reporter assays in Xenopusembryos, we have delineated the BMP-4-responsive region in theXvent-2B promoter between −275 and −152. TheXvent-2B BRE contains regulatory elements similar to the closely related Xvent-2 BRE (47.Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Both elements were found to contain a CAGAC motif at its core and require flanking sequences downstream from the Smad4 site. In the present report, we demonstrate through the use of gel mobility shift assays and DNase I protection experiments with bacterially expressed protein that Smad4 directly binds this CAGAC sequence. Moreover, the identified BRE in theXvent-2B promoter requires an additional upstream region that is necessary for full transcriptional activation ofXvent-2B by Smad1 and Smad4. Through the use of in vitro binding studies, Smad1 binding to the upstream region was identified and characterized. The present study provides a more detailed analysis of the Smad1 and Smad4 recognition elements of theXvent-2B promoter, which mediate activation by BMP-4.The crystal structure of the Smad3 MH1 domain bound to a palindromic GTCTAGAC octamer has been determined, revealing insight into the specificity of DNA binding by the Smads (21.Shi Y. Wang Y.-F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure, sequence-specific DNA recognition was facilitated by interaction of amino acids with only three bases of the Smad binding element. As these residues are invariant among the Smads, the GNCT motif or its palindrome AGNC is expected to be recognized by other Smads with the exception of Smad2. Smad binding elements within promoters of TGF-β and activin-responsive genes have been shown to contain multiple motifs containing this core sequence. However, the regulation of TGF-β signaling specificity remains unclear and must be controlled by additional parameters, as some of the identified Smad recognition sites were found to be dispensable for biological activity (20.Yingling J.M. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T. Wang X-F Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The BMP-responsive region of Xvent-2B contains five putative AGNC SBEs differing in their contribution toward Smad-induced transcriptional activation. Through deletion and point mutations it was demonstrated that loss or modification of SBE I and III did not disrupt Smad1/Smad4 responsiveness, but mutants exhibited significantly lower basal levels of activity. Thus, the absolute level of activation was reduced. Mutation of SBE II enhanced Smad1/Smad4-mediated transcriptional activation as compared with the corresponding wild-type sequence, suggesting that this site may participate in the negative regulation of Xvent-2B. Alternatively, the SBE II may have been converted to an element that is recognized by a transcription factor that cooperates with the Smads. In contrast to the upstream SBEs, deletion or mutation of the proximal SBE V significantly disrupted Smad1/Smad4 responsiveness. SBE IV was the only SBE that was found to be essential for Smad1/Smad4 responsiveness, consistent with the recent analysis of the Xvent-2 promoter (47.Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar).A palindromic GTCTAGAC sequence was defined by polymerase chain reaction selection studies as the optimal binding site for Smad3 and Smad4. However, studies have not been performed that demonstrate that this is the optimal Smad1 target sequence (22.Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Although the amino acids that directly participate in base-specific DNA recognition are conserved among the Smads, several residues immediately preceding the DNA binding β-hairpin domain are conserved between receptor specific Smads of the same class that may confer subtle variations in Smad binding specificity (21.Shi Y. Wang Y.-F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, Smad1, Smad4, and Smad3 were capable of binding this sequence; however, slightly different binding affinities were observed (21.Shi Y. Wang Y.-F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar).Differences in Smad DNA binding specificity were also observed on theXvent-2B promoter where Smad1 and Smad4 preferentially protected distinct sites of the BRE in DNase I protection assays. Smad4 bound to the sequences between −196 and −176, which contain SBE III and IV, the latter of which was shown to be essential for Smad1/Smad4-mediated transcriptional activation. These results suggest that additional sites outside the core Smad site confer specificity to TGF-β signaling. This has already been suggested by the predominance of the sequence AGc/aCAGACA in multiple TGF-β-responsive promoters, which contains at its core a GNCT sequence in reverse orientation (24.Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the essential SBE IV of the Xvent-2B promoter has flanking sequences very similar to this AGAC Smad3/Smad4 target site found within several TGF-β-responsive regions and adjacent to FAST binding sites in the activin-responsive element (TableI) (24.Dennler S.

This motif is not limited to vertebrates, as Daf-3 from C. elegans,which is most closely related to Smad4, was also reported to mediate a transcriptional response through this motif (32.Thatcher J.D. Haun C. Okkema P.G. Development. 1999; 126: 97-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An exception may be the Drosophila Smad4 homologue, Medea, which was shown to recognize GC-rich target sites (31.Xu X. Yin Z. Hudson J.B. Ferguson E.L. Frasch M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2354-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 50.Nguyen H.T. Xu X. Dev. Biol. 1998; 204: 550-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As these elements are responsive to multiple TGF-β pathways, this site most likely represents the Smad4 binding site, which is shared among the various pathways. However, demonstrated here (Fig. 3 A) and in previous reports, this sequence also represents a Smad3 recognition site. Thus, for full-transcriptional activation by TGF-β, at least two copies of this sequence would be required to accommodate Smad3 and Smad4. This is supported by the requirement of multimerized copies of this element from the PAI-1 promoter for TGF-β responsiveness (22.Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 24.Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 20709-20716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A recent study has demonstrated that a region of the PAI-1 promoter containing two SBEs, when present in a single copy, was sufficient for TGF-β transcriptional activation (52.Hua X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13130-13135Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Additionally, when the JunBTGF-β-responsive SBE was multimerized four times, it was also induced by activin and BMP-2. The activation of this artificial reporter was most likely due to binding via Smad4, because Smad1 and Smad2 were not able to bind this element (26.Jonk L.J.C. Itoh S. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Further support that this conserved element is a Smad4 binding site is demonstrated by activin A-responsive elements that harbor a copy of this sequence. The SBE is bound by Smad4, whereas Smad2 DNA association is achieved indirectly through FAST binding (48.Yeo C.-Y. Chen X. Whitman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26584-26590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).

(55.Kawabata M. Inoue H. Hanyu A. Imamura T. Miyazono K. EMBO J. 1998; 14: 4056-4065Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar) suggest that Smad hetero-oligomers may be trimers but do not exclude that other oligomeric states of the Smads exist. The identified Smad recognition sites in the Xvent-2B promoter would accommodate binding for a trimer composed of one molecule of Smad4 and two Smad1 molecules. The 53-base pair BRE of Xvent-2 promoter delineated by Hataet al. (47.Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) contained a single Smad4 binding site and was multimerized four times for induction studies by BMP-2. Multimerization of this element may create an artificial response element by the presence of additional copies of the BRE providing the required number of Smad binding sites.DNase I footprinting experiments demonstrated that Smad1 preferentially protects the DNA between −253 and −210 in two distinct regions, which are required in addition to the Smad4 binding site to mediate optimal Smad1/Smad4 transcriptional activation. An element that is sufficient to mediate Dpp responsiveness of tinman expression was also found to contain two essential Smad binding sites, one that bound Mad exclusively and another that was recognized by both Medea and Mad (31.Xu X. Yin Z. Hudson J.B. Ferguson E.L. Frasch M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2354-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the site of Smad1 binding does not resemble that of the Smad4/Smad3 target site, the GCCGNCGc recognition sequence of Mad, or the clusters of GNCN repeats that are often found in TGF-β-responsive regions (29.Kim J.

Both of the regions protected by Smad1 in theXvent-2B promoter contained GCAT sequences, which through mutational analysis of the promoter were shown to mediate Smad1 binding. This motif contains the first and last positions of the previously identified Smad binding element, which together participate in four of the five base-specific hydrogen bonds between Smad3 and DNA (21.Shi Y.

PGs are formed by PGH synthase of seminal vesicles, but the mechanism of biosynthesis of (19R)-hydroxy-PGE has not been resolved. Many properties of a tentative PG 19-hydroxylase can be deduced from analysis of PGE compounds in semen. First, (19R)-hydroxy-PGE1and (19R)-hydroxy-PGE2 are equally abundant. 18-Hydroxy-PGE and small amounts of Δ18- and Δ19-PGE compounds are also present (5.Oliw E.H. Sprecher H. Hamberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2675-2683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Oliw E.H. Benthin G. Hamberg M. Arch. Biochem.

The PG 19-hydroxylase will thus be expected to oxygenate C-19 and C-18, whereas the Δ18- and Δ19-PGE compounds might be formed by typical cytochrome P450-catalyzed desaturations (5.Oliw E.H.

The ratios of PGE1 to (19R)-hydroxy-PGE1 and PGE2 to (19R)-hydroxy-PGE2 change little in ejaculates obtained at long or short time intervals (4.Oliw E.H. Kinn A.-C. Kvist U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7222-7227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ratios are reproducible in each subject, but vary considerably between normal men (4.Oliw E.H. Kinn A.-C. Kvist U. J.

A majority can be defined as “rapid” hydroxylators with PGE/(19R)-hydroxy-PGE ratios below 0.4 (8.Oliw E.H. Johnsen O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 963: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).It seems likely that 19-hydroxylation of PGs is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 of seminal vesicles (4.Oliw E.H. Kinn A.-C. Kvist U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7222-7227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the enzyme has not been convincingly demonstrated. Microsomes of primate and human seminal vesicles and NADPH only slowly metabolized PGE2 to 19-hydroxy-PGE2, which differed from the biosynthesisin vivo (1.Taylor P.L. Kelly R.W. Nature. 1974; 250: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 2.Kelly R.W. Taylor P.L. Hearn J.P. Short R.V. Martin D.E. Marston J.H.

J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17845-17853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This left us with an enigmatic microsomal preparation, which rapidly catalyzed 18-hydroxylation of arachidonate and only slowly catalyzed 19-hydroxylation of PGE2.What is the biological function of seminal PGs in humans? Little can be stated with absolute certainty. Seminal fluid contains an unprecedented high concentration of PGs. Exposure of sperm to PGs is not required forin vitro fertilization (11.Küpker W. Schlegel P.N. Al-Hasani S. Fornara P. Johannisson R. Sandmann J. Schill T. Bals-Pratsch M. Ludwig M. Diedrich K. Fertil. Steril. 2000; 73: 453-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It therefore seems likely that these PGs contribute to fertility by ensuring maximum efficiencyin vivo, but the mechanism is unknown. PGs have a wide spectrum of biological effects mediated through activation of G-protein-coupled prostanoid receptors (12.Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Seminal PGE compounds may have immunosuppressive actions in the female genital tract, induce tolerance to sperm antigens, promote sperm survival, and contribute to the acrosome reaction (3.Kelly R.W. Int. J. Androl. 1999; 22: 2-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13.Denison F.C. Grant V.E. Calder A.A. Kelly R.W. Mol. Hum.

Targeted disruption of PGH synthase and prostanoid receptor genes has shown that PGs are of physiological importance in rodent reproduction (12.Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 15.Langenbach R. Loftin C. Lee C. Tiano H. Biochem.

In pursuit of the tentative PG 19-hydroxylase, we recently performed a systematic study of cytochrome P450 mRNA of human seminal vesicles (17.Bylund J. Finnström N. Oliw E.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). mRNA of a novel enzyme, CYP4F8, appeared to be abundantly expressed in all samples examined. The objective of the present study was to identify the function of this novel human cytochrome P450.DISCUSSIONmRNA of a new enzyme, CYP4F8, was recently discovered in human seminal vesicles (17.Bylund J. Finnström N. Oliw E.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We have expressed CYP4F8 in yeast and report as our main finding that recombinant CYP4F8 metabolizes PGH1and PGH2 to 19-hydroxy-PGH1 and 19-hydroxy-PGH2, respectively. Three stable PGH2 analogues were also substrates, whereas PGD2, PGE1, PGE2, and PGF2α were metabolized poorly (Table I). Our results suggest that PGH1 and PGH2 are endogenous substrates for CYP4F8, which thus can be named PGH 19-hydroxylase. CYP4F8 is the first described hydroxylase with pronounced specificity for prostaglandin endoperoxides.9,11-Epoxymethano-PGH2 (U-44069) was the best substrate of recombinant CYP4F8. U-44069 was converted to 19- and 18-hydroxy metabolites at a ratio of ∼6:1, with a K m of ∼7 μm and a V max of ∼260 pmol min−1 pmol P450−1. This V max value is remarkably high for a mammalian cytochrome P450 (20.Truan G. Cullin C. Reisdorf P. Urban P. Pompon D. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 125: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 22.Oscarson M. Hidestrand M. Johansson I. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 1034-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). 9,11-Diazo-15-deoxy-PGH2 (U-51605), PGH1, PGH2, and 11,9-epoxymethano-PGH2 (U-46619) were also good substrates, although there was a remarkable difference between U-44069 and U-46619 (Table I). PGH1 and PGH2 and their hydroxy metabolites decompose in buffer with a half-life of ∼5 min at 37 °C (18.Hamberg M. Svensson J. Wakabayashi T. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), which decreases the metabolism by CYP4F8 and complicates the analysis of the products.To address the question of whether CYP4F8 is present in human seminal vesicles, we compared the catalytic properties of microsomes and recombinant CYP4F8. Both metabolized U-44069, U-46619, U-51605, and arachidonic acid to virtually the same profile of 19- and 18-hydroxy metabolites (Table II). Both preparations also oxygenated PGH2 to 19-hydroxy metabolites and to small amounts of 18-hydroxy metabolites. These observations suggest that CYP4F8 is present in seminal vesicles. Human and primate semen contains >98% of the 19R-stereoisomers of 19-hydroxy-PGs (1.Taylor P.L. Kelly R.W. Nature. 1974; 250: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 2.Kelly R.W. Taylor P.L. Hearn J.P. Short R.V. Martin D.E. Marston J.H. Nature. 1976; 260: 544-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 3.Kelly R.W. Int. J.

It remains to be determined whether CYP4F8 oxidizes PGH2 to the 19R-stereoisomer of 19-hydroxy-PGH2. However, we confirmed that CYP4F8 metabolizes arachidonate to >95% of the 18R-stereoisomer of 18-HETE, which is the stereoisomer formed by microsomes of primate seminal vesicles (10.Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17845-17853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).PGH synthase-1 is an integral membrane protein with its catalytic domains on the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum (28.Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). The substrate channel of PGH synthase-1 faces the endoplasmic reticulum. Its entrance is surrounded by the membrane-binding surface, which does not extend beyond one leaflet of the lipid bilayer. Human cytochromes P450 are also integral membrane proteins, but their catalytic domains are located on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (29.von Wachenfeldt C. Johnson E.F. Ortiz de Montellano R.P. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 183-223Crossref Google Scholar). PGH2 must cross the lipid bilayer to gain access to CYP4F8. It is known that an important PGE synthase is also associated with the same membrane system (30.Jakobsson P.-J. Thorén S. Morgenstern R. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7220-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). PGE synthase might efficiently metabolize PGH compounds, as non-enzymatic breakdown products, e.g. PGD compounds, have not been detected in human seminal fluid. The rapid biosynthesis of 19-hydroxy-PGE1 and 19-hydroxy-PGE2 in vivo suggests that PGH synthase, PGH 19-hydroxylase, and PGE synthase are closely linked (1.Taylor P.L. Kelly R.W. Nature. 1974; 250: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar,2.Kelly R.W. Taylor P.L. Hearn J.P. Short R.V. Martin D.E. Marston J.H. Nature. 1976; 260: 544-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 4.Oliw E.H. Kinn A.-C. Kvist U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7222-7227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A proposed mechanism for biosynthesis of (19R)-hydroxy-PGE2 in human seminal vesicles is shown in Fig. 6.There is a marked inter-individual variation in the amount of PGE and 19-hydroxy-PGE compounds in normal human seminal fluid (8.Oliw E.H. Johnsen O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 963: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 9.Pourian M.R. Kvist U. Björndahl L. Oliw E.H. Andrologia. 1995; 27: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This may be due to variable expression of CYP4F8 or due to isoforms with reduced enzyme activity. CYP4F8 and CYP4F3 are located on the CYP4F cluster on chromosome 19p13.1 (17.Bylund J. Finnström N. Oliw E.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). CYP4F3 catalyzes ω-hydroxylation of leukotriene B4 and was recently found to consist of distinct isoforms that were regulated by alternative promoter usage and exon splicing (31.Kikuta Y. Kusunose E. Endo K. Yamamoto S. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Kusunose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9376-9380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Christmas P. Ursino S.R. Fox J.W. Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21191-21199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Whether isoforms of CYP4F8 exist is now under investigation.Two thiolate hemoproteins, thromboxane synthase (CYP5A) of platelets and prostacyclin synthase (CYP8A) of the vascular endothelium, can rearrange PGH2 into thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin, respectively (33.Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Smith W.L. Marnett L.J. DeWitt D.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 49: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). These enzymes do not require NADPH and differ from CYP4F8 in this respect. It is possible that PGH2 might be a substrate of other cytochromes P450. Recombinant CYP4A11 and microsomes from human kidneys hydroxylate U-44069 at the ω-side chain. 2J. Bylund and E. H. Oliw, unpublished observations. The NADPH-dependent metabolism of PGH2 in the kidney and other tissues merits further investigation.In summary, our results suggest that CYP4F8 of human seminal vesicles catalyzes ω2-hydroxylation of PGH1 and PGH2, which will lead to biosynthesis of the two main PGs of human seminal fluid, (19R)-hydroxy-PGE1 and (19R)-hydroxy-PGE2. CYP4F8 is the first described enzyme with both specificity and kinetic competence for hydroxylation of PGH1 and PGH2. Human and primate seminal fluid contains conspicuous amounts of prostaglandin (PG)1E1, PGE2, (19R)-hydroxy-PGE1, and (19R)-hydroxy-PGE2 (1.Taylor P.L. Kelly R.W. Nature. 1974; 250: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 2.Kelly R.W. Taylor P.L. Hearn J.P. Short R.V. Martin D.E. Marston J.H.

PGs are formed by PGH synthase of seminal vesicles, but the mechanism of biosynthesis of (19R)-hydroxy-PGE has not been resolved. Many properties of a tentative PG 19-hydroxylase can be deduced from analysis of PGE compounds in semen. First, (19R)-hydroxy-PGE1and (19R)-hydroxy-PGE2 are equally abundant. 18-Hydroxy-PGE and small amounts of Δ18- and Δ19-PGE compounds are also present (5.Oliw E.H. Sprecher H. Hamberg M. J. Biol.

The PG 19-hydroxylase will thus be expected to oxygenate C-19 and C-18, whereas the Δ18- and Δ19-PGE compounds might be formed by typical cytochrome P450-catalyzed desaturations (5.Oliw E.H.

The ratios of PGE1 to (19R)-hydroxy-PGE1 and PGE2 to (19R)-hydroxy-PGE2 change little in ejaculates obtained at long or short time intervals (4.Oliw E.H. Kinn A.-C. Kvist U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7222-7227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ratios are reproducible in each subject, but vary considerably between normal men (4.Oliw E.H. Kinn A.-C. Kvist U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7222-7227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Oliw E.H. Johnsen O. Biochim. Biophys.

A majority can be defined as “rapid” hydroxylators with PGE/(19R)-hydroxy-PGE ratios below 0.4 (8.Oliw E.H. Johnsen O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 963: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It seems likely that 19-hydroxylation of PGs is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 of seminal vesicles (4.Oliw E.H. Kinn A.-C. Kvist U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7222-7227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the enzyme has not been convincingly demonstrated. Microsomes of primate and human seminal vesicles and NADPH only slowly metabolized PGE2 to 19-hydroxy-PGE2, which differed from the biosynthesisin vivo (1.Taylor P.L. Kelly R.W. Nature. 1974; 250: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 2.Kelly R.W. Taylor P.L. Hearn J.P. Short R.V. Martin D.E. Marston J.H.

Chem. 1988; 263: 7222-7227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, microsomes of monkey seminal vesicles and NADPH rapidly metabolized arachidonic acid to (18R)-HETE (10.Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17845-17853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This left us with an enigmatic microsomal preparation, which rapidly catalyzed 18-hydroxylation of arachidonate and only slowly catalyzed 19-hydroxylation of PGE2. What is the biological function of seminal PGs in humans? Little can be stated with absolute certainty. Seminal fluid contains an unprecedented high concentration of PGs. Exposure of sperm to PGs is not required forin vitro fertilization (11.Küpker W. Schlegel P.N. Al-Hasani S. Fornara P. Johannisson R. Sandmann J. Schill T. Bals-Pratsch M. Ludwig M. Diedrich K. Fertil. Steril. 2000; 73: 453-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It therefore seems likely that these PGs contribute to fertility by ensuring maximum efficiencyin vivo, but the mechanism is unknown. PGs have a wide spectrum of biological effects mediated through activation of G-protein-coupled prostanoid receptors (12.Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Seminal PGE compounds may have immunosuppressive actions in the female genital tract, induce tolerance to sperm antigens, promote sperm survival, and contribute to the acrosome reaction (3.Kelly R.W. Int. J. Androl. 1999; 22: 2-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13.Denison F.C. Grant V.E. Calder A.A. Kelly R.W. Mol. Hum.

Targeted disruption of PGH synthase and prostanoid receptor genes has shown that PGs are of physiological importance in rodent reproduction (12.Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 15.Langenbach R. Loftin C. Lee C. Tiano H. Biochem.

Med. 1999; 5: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the biosynthesis of (19R)-hydroxy-PGE in male genital organs might provide tools to study their role in reproduction. In pursuit of the tentative PG 19-hydroxylase, we recently performed a systematic study of cytochrome P450 mRNA of human seminal vesicles (17.Bylund J. Finnström N. Oliw E.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). mRNA of a novel enzyme, CYP4F8, appeared to be abundantly expressed in all samples examined. The objective of the present study was to identify the function of this novel human cytochrome P450. DISCUSSIONmRNA of a new enzyme, CYP4F8, was recently discovered in human seminal vesicles (17.Bylund J. Finnström N. Oliw E.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We have expressed CYP4F8 in yeast and report as our main finding that recombinant CYP4F8 metabolizes PGH1and PGH2 to 19-hydroxy-PGH1 and 19-hydroxy-PGH2, respectively. Three stable PGH2 analogues were also substrates, whereas PGD2, PGE1, PGE2, and PGF2α were metabolized poorly (Table I). Our results suggest that PGH1 and PGH2 are endogenous substrates for CYP4F8, which thus can be named PGH 19-hydroxylase. CYP4F8 is the first described hydroxylase with pronounced specificity for prostaglandin endoperoxides.9,11-Epoxymethano-PGH2 (U-44069) was the best substrate of recombinant CYP4F8. U-44069 was converted to 19- and 18-hydroxy metabolites at a ratio of ∼6:1, with a K m of ∼7 μm and a V max of ∼260 pmol min−1 pmol P450−1. This V max value is remarkably high for a mammalian cytochrome P450 (20.Truan G. Cullin C. Reisdorf P. Urban P. Pompon D. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 125: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 22.Oscarson M. Hidestrand M. Johansson I. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 1034-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). 9,11-Diazo-15-deoxy-PGH2 (U-51605), PGH1, PGH2, and 11,9-epoxymethano-PGH2 (U-46619) were also good substrates, although there was a remarkable difference between U-44069 and U-46619 (Table I). PGH1 and PGH2 and their hydroxy metabolites decompose in buffer with a half-life of ∼5 min at 37 °C (18.Hamberg M. Svensson J. Wakabayashi T. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), which decreases the metabolism by CYP4F8 and complicates the analysis of the products.To address the question of whether CYP4F8 is present in human seminal vesicles, we compared the catalytic properties of microsomes and recombinant CYP4F8. Both metabolized U-44069, U-46619, U-51605, and arachidonic acid to virtually the same profile of 19- and 18-hydroxy metabolites (Table II). Both preparations also oxygenated PGH2 to 19-hydroxy metabolites and to small amounts of 18-hydroxy metabolites. These observations suggest that CYP4F8 is present in seminal vesicles. Human and primate semen contains >98% of the 19R-stereoisomers of 19-hydroxy-PGs (1.Taylor P.L. Kelly R.W. Nature. 1974; 250: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 2.Kelly R.W.

It remains to be determined whether CYP4F8 oxidizes PGH2 to the 19R-stereoisomer of 19-hydroxy-PGH2. However, we confirmed that CYP4F8 metabolizes arachidonate to >95% of the 18R-stereoisomer of 18-HETE, which is the stereoisomer formed by microsomes of primate seminal vesicles (10.Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17845-17853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).PGH synthase-1 is an integral membrane protein with its catalytic domains on the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum (28.Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). The substrate channel of PGH synthase-1 faces the endoplasmic reticulum. Its entrance is surrounded by the membrane-binding surface, which does not extend beyond one leaflet of the lipid bilayer. Human cytochromes P450 are also integral membrane proteins, but their catalytic domains are located on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (29.von Wachenfeldt C. Johnson E.F. Ortiz de Montellano R.P. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 183-223Crossref Google Scholar). PGH2 must cross the lipid bilayer to gain access to CYP4F8. It is known that an important PGE synthase is also associated with the same membrane system (30.Jakobsson P.-J. Thorén S. Morgenstern R. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7220-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). PGE synthase might efficiently metabolize PGH compounds, as non-enzymatic breakdown products, e.g. PGD compounds, have not been detected in human seminal fluid. The rapid biosynthesis of 19-hydroxy-PGE1 and 19-hydroxy-PGE2 in vivo suggests that PGH synthase, PGH 19-hydroxylase, and PGE synthase are closely linked (1.Taylor P.L. Kelly R.W. Nature. 1974; 250: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar,2.Kelly R.W. Taylor P.L. Hearn J.P. Short R.V. Martin D.E. Marston J.H.

A proposed mechanism for biosynthesis of (19R)-hydroxy-PGE2 in human seminal vesicles is shown in Fig. 6.There is a marked inter-individual variation in the amount of PGE and 19-hydroxy-PGE compounds in normal human seminal fluid (8.Oliw E.H. Johnsen O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 963: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 9.Pourian M.R. Kvist U. Björndahl L. Oliw E.H. Andrologia. 1995; 27: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This may be due to variable expression of CYP4F8 or due to isoforms with reduced enzyme activity. CYP4F8 and CYP4F3 are located on the CYP4F cluster on chromosome 19p13.1 (17.Bylund J. Finnström N. Oliw E.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). CYP4F3 catalyzes ω-hydroxylation of leukotriene B4 and was recently found to consist of distinct isoforms that were regulated by alternative promoter usage and exon splicing (31.Kikuta Y. Kusunose E.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21191-21199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Whether isoforms of CYP4F8 exist is now under investigation.Two thiolate hemoproteins, thromboxane synthase (CYP5A) of platelets and prostacyclin synthase (CYP8A) of the vascular endothelium, can rearrange PGH2 into thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin, respectively (33.Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Smith W.L. Marnett L.J. DeWitt D.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 49: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). These enzymes do not require NADPH and differ from CYP4F8 in this respect. It is possible that PGH2 might be a substrate of other cytochromes P450. Recombinant CYP4A11 and microsomes from human kidneys hydroxylate U-44069 at the ω-side chain. 2J. Bylund and E. H. Oliw, unpublished observations. The NADPH-dependent metabolism of PGH2 in the kidney and other tissues merits further investigation.In summary, our results suggest that CYP4F8 of human seminal vesicles catalyzes ω2-hydroxylation of PGH1 and PGH2, which will lead to biosynthesis of the two main PGs of human seminal fluid, (19R)-hydroxy-PGE1 and (19R)-hydroxy-PGE2.

Yeast TFIID is composed of TBP, the TATA box binding protein, and 14 distinct TBP-associated factors (TAFs), which range in size from 17 to 150 kDa. Twelve of the TAF subunits have been previously identified, but two, TAF48p and TAF65p, are novel. TAF48p exhibits significant sequence similarity to the conserved C-terminal region of Drosophila TAF110p, human TAF130p, and human TAF105p and is encoded by a previously identified gene MPT1. TAF65p shows no significant sequence homology to any previously identified TAFp. The genes encoding TAF48p and TAF65p are single copy and essential for normal yeast cell growth.

TFIID is the only general transcription initiation factor (GTF) with a specific TATA box binding activity, and binding of TFIID to the TATA box is the first and rate-limiting step in formation of a complex competent to initiate transcription in vitro(1.Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). A TATA box element is found within the promoter of many mRNA encoding genes and is required for specific transcription initiation both in vitro and in vivo (2.Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical studies published to date from yeast, human, andDrosophila systems have revealed TFIID to be a multi-subunit complex comprised of TBP, the TATA box binding protein, and 10–12 TBP-associated factors (TAFs) (2.Hampsey M.

Whether this role can be directly ascribed to TFIID function has been difficult to interpret as a subset of TFIID TAF subunits, specifically TAF90p, TAF61p, TAF60p, TAF25p, and TAF17p, have been identified as integral subunits of the yeast histone acetylase Spt-Ada-Gcn5 (SAGA) complex (11.Grant P.A.

However, a recent study has shown that loss of TAF40p function (TAF40p is believed to be specific to TFIID) severely impairs ongoing high level RNAP II-mediated transcription in vivo (12.Komarnitsky P.B. Michel B. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2484-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This result strongly argues that TFIID is required for the transcription of many RNAP II-dependent genes in vivo. Studies in the yeast system have proven invaluable in understanding the role of TAFs, and thus TFIID function, in mediating RNAP II transcription in vivo. It is somewhat surprising then that yeast TFIID is rather poorly defined biochemically. Independently, we and others have used a combination of biochemical purification and protein sequence comparison to identify 12 yeast TFIID TAF subunits (13.Reese J.C. Apone L. Walker S.S. Griffin L.A. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 14.Poon D. Bai Y. Campbell A.M. Bjorklund S. Kim Y.J. Zhou S. Kornberg R.D. Weil P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Although these studies clearly suggest the existence of a yeast TFIID complex composed of TBP plus 12 TAFs, this fact has not been directly shown biochemically. Indeed, it is not clear at present whether this is the minimal or core TFIID assembly. Of the 12 known yTAF TFIID subunits, only one, TAF47p, does not have a known metazoan homologue (see Table I). Conversely, metazoan TAFs dTAF110p and hTAF130p, which have been shown to mediate transactivation by the glutamine-rich transactivator Sp1 (18.Hoey T. Weinzierl R.O.J. Gill G. Chen J.L. Dynlacht B.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 72: 247-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 19.Tanese N. Saluja D. Vassallo M.F. Chen J.L. Admon A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13611-13616Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), do not have a known yeast homologue. Thus it has been suggested that yeast may be evolutionarily distinct from metazoans and lacking the co-activator(s) necessary to mediate transactivation by glutamine-rich activators, as it was initially reported that Sp1 could not stimulate transcription in yeast (20.Ponticelli A.S. Pardee T.S. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 983-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, this conclusion seems contradictory because native yeast activators such as Hap2p and Mcm1p both contain glutamine-rich domains, which by themselves are capable of transactivation (21.Xiao H. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22873-22876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Sp1 can stimulate transcription in yeast when the reporter gene of interest is carried on a high copy plasmid, but not when integrated into the genome (21.Xiao H. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22873-22876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Additionally, a recent report has identified a potentially novel histone-like pair in hTAF20p and hTAF130p (22.Gangloff Y.G. Werten S. Romier C. Carre L. Poch O. Moras D. Davidson I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 340-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). hTAF20p has a yeast homologue in yeast TAF61p. Because other histone-like pairs are highly conserved between yeast and humans, it would be surprising if yeast did not have an equivalent interacting pair to hTAF20p-hTAF130p. Together, these results suggest the possibility of an unidentified yeast equivalent to metazoan dTAF110p and hTAF130p.Table IComparison of yeast and metazoan TFIID subunitsYeastHumanDrosophilaTBPTBPTBPTAF150TAF150TAF150TAF130(145)TAF250TAF230TAF90TAF100TAF80TAF67TAF55TAF55TAF65aThis study.TAF61(68)TAF20TAF30TAF60TAF80(70)TAF62TAF48aThis study.TAF130/105TAF110TAF47TAF40TAF28TAF30TAF30AF-9/ENLbBased on sequence homology.TAF25TAF30TAF16/24cSee Ref. 41.TAF19TAF18TAF17TAF31(32)TAF42Known TFIID subunits from each organism are listed in each column.

As a first step toward a concise biochemical analysis of yeast TFIID, we have purified TFIID from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to near homogeneity. We find that yeast TFIID is reproducibly composed of TBP plus 14 distinct TAFs. Two of the 14 TAFs, TAF48p and TAF65p, are novel. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that TAF48p and TAF65p are TFIID-specific TAFs and that these TAFp are not components of the yeast SAGA complex. The genes encoding TAF48p and TAF65p are both single copy and essential for vegetative growth. TAF65p does not resemble any previously identified metazoan TAF, but TAF48p is similar to the conserved C-terminal region of dTAF110p, hTAF130p, and hTAF105p. The significance of these results is discussed below. Escherichia coli strain XL-1 Blue (23.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

E. coli expression plasmids for TAF48p and TAF65p were created by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the appropriate ORF and ligation into pRSET-A (Invitrogen). An E. coli expression plasmid for Dr1p was made in a similar fashion except the ORF was ligated into pET15b (Novagen). Standard laboratory protocols and techniques for DNA manipulations were used (26.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar), and all plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing.

Standard laboratory techniques and protocols were followed for yeast manipulations (32.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Buffer A (BA) is 20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, plus the indicated millimolar amount of KOAc (e.g. BA300 has 300 mmKOAc). All manipulations were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. The 1 m Bio-Rex 70 fraction was prepared from YSLS14 or YSLS18 essentially as described (33.Poon D. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15325-15328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except loading and washing of the Bio-Rex 70 column was performed with BA300. Immunoaffinity chromatography was performed as follows. Typically, to 40 mL of 1 m Bio-Rex 70 faction (15–20 mg/mL), 10% Nonidet P-40, and 10 mg/mL ethidium bromide were added so that, after dilution with BA0 to a conductivity equal to that of BA300, the final concentrations were 0.1% and 0.1 mg/mL, respectively. 10 mg of anti-HA (mAb 12CA5, Roche) cross-linked to 2.5 mL of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) was added and the slurry was incubated 12 to 14 h on a tilted board. The resin was collected in a 10-mL column and washed extensively with BA300 plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40, then with BA200 plus 0.001% Nonidet P-40. Elution was performed by adding 1 volume of BA200 containing 0.001% Nonidet P-40 with 2 mg/mL 3 × HA peptide (14.Poon D. Bai Y. Campbell A.M. Bjorklund S. Kim Y.J. Zhou S. Kornberg R.D. Weil P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8224-8228Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The slurry was incubated 30 to 40 min at 24 °C, the elute was collected by a brief spin at 1000 rpm, and a second elution was performed as above. Elutes were pooled, and bovine serum albumin was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/mL. The TFIID fraction was applied to a HR 5/5 Mono S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in BA200 plus 0.001% Nonidet P-40. Neither the 3 × HA peptide nor major protein contaminants bound to the column. Bound proteins were resolved with a 15-mL linear gradient to BA1000 plus 0.001% Nonidet P-40. TFIID eluted in a single peak at ∼375 mm KOAc. Peak fractions (3–4 mL) were pooled, dialyzed against BA200 with 30% glycerol, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. The identification of previously known TFIID subunits was confirmed in the Mono S fraction by immunoblotting. The identification of unknown proteins was performed as follows. Mono S-purified HATBP TFIID was resolved using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on a 10% NuPAGE (Novex) gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Each of the unknown bands was excised and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy (Borealis Biosciences Inc.). The identified peptides covered 40–50% of the total protein sequence for each identified protein. Protein sequence searches were performed with BLAST 2.0 software (NCBI), and ClustalW alignments were done with MacVector 6.5 software (Oxford Molecular). Recombinant protein production and generation of affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies for Dr1p, TAF48p, and TAF65p was performed as described (10.Sanders S.L. Klebanow E.R. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18847-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against other TFIID subunits and Gcn5p have been described (10.Sanders S.L. Klebanow E.R. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18847-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-HA (mAb 3F10, Roche) was utilized for immunoblotting HA-tagged proteins. For immunoprecipitations, 50 A 600 units aliquots of exponentially growing yeast cells were harvested, washed with distilled H2O, transferred to a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube, frozen on dry ice, and stored at −80 °C. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 0.6 mL of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, 300 mm KOAc, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, plus protease inhibitors), ∼0.7 mL of glass beads were added, and cells were lysed by a 30-s burst with a Mini-Beadbeater-8 (BioSpec). Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation (10 min at 15,000 × g). Typically 0.2–0.3 mL of whole cell extract (∼7 mg/mL) was recovered. The extract was pre-cleared by addition of a one-half volume of protein A-Sepharose, which had been washed and slurried to 1:1 in lysis buffer. The resin-extract slurry was incubated for 5 min, the beads were pelleted by a brief spin in a microcentrifuge, and an aliquot of the cleared extract was taken as input. To 50 μL of the cleared extract was added: 5–10 μg of anti-HA (mAb 12CA5) or anti-Flag (mAb M2, IBI) antibody cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose resin (2 mg/mL); 2 μL of 10 mg/mL ethidium bromide; and lysis buffer to 200 μL. Reactions were incubated 12–14 h with agitation. Antigen-antibody complexes bound to the beads were recovered by a brief spin in a microcentrifuge, beads were washed three times with 0.5 mL of lysis buffer, and 20 μL of sample buffer was added. The indicated amount of input and precipitate (see Figure legends) was subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 4–12% NuPAGE gel and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore), and immunoblotting was performed as described (10.Sanders S.L. Klebanow E.R. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18847-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Having previously used a combination of ion exchange and immunoaffinity chromatography to first identify TAFs in S. cerevisiae (14.Poon D. Bai Y. Campbell A.M. Bjorklund S. Kim Y.J. Zhou S. Kornberg R.D. Weil P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8224-8228Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 33.Poon D. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15325-15328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we took a similar approach to purify TFIID. Strains that harbored a single copy of the HA epitope tag at the N terminus of either SPT15 (TBP) orTAF130 were subjected to the purification scheme outlined in Fig. 1 A. It is important to note that the HA-tagged alleles were the sole source of TBP or TAF130p in the cell. Furthermore, tagged alleles were under the control of the appropriate native promoter such that protein levels in HA-tagged andwt untagged strains were identical (data not shown). SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining of pooled peak fractions from the final Mono S column indicated that these TFIID preparations contained 17 polypeptides, which were consistently copurified (Fig. 1 B). Immunoblotting confirmed the identity of TBP and all 12 previously identified TAF subunits believed to comprise yeast TFIID (Fig.1 B and data not shown). Four additional unknown polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of ∼65 kDa and a triplet of proteins of ∼48 kDa also were consistently copurified in the TFIID fraction (see TAF48p* and TAF65p*, in Fig. 1 B and below). Importantly, the composition of TFIID was essentially identical whether purified from the HATBP or HATAF130 strain. These results, together with the fact that immunoblotting indicated that the major fraction (70–100%) of those TFIID TAF subunits previously believed to be specific to TFIID (TAF130p, TAF67p, TAF47p, TAF40p, and TAF19p) were recovered in the 1 m Bio-Rex 70 fraction (data not shown), suggest that the major form of TFIID in S. cerevisiae is composed of TBP plus 14 distinct TAFs. As described above, four unknown polypeptides were consistently copurified in the TFIID fractions. Each of the unknown polypeptide bands were excised from a Coomassie-stained gel and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry for identification. Peptide sequence from the unknown 65-kDa protein identified a previously predicted ORF, YML114c, which encodes a protein with a deduced molecular mass of 58 kDa with no known function. We refer to the protein encoded by YML114c as TAF65p. BLAST search analysis revealed no significant homology to any protein of known function. However, TAF65p does contain a potential coiled-coiled domain similar to that of myosin (data not show). Gene disruption in a diploid strain followed by tetrad analysis indicated thatTAF65 is essential for yeast cell viability (data not shown). Peptide sequence from the three ∼48 kDa polypeptides indicated that they represented differentially phosphorylated forms of the same protein (data not shown) encoded by the previously identified ORFMPT1. MPT1 is an essential yeast gene (data not shown) 2Estey, L. A., and Douglas, M. G. (1994) Saccharomyces Genome Database, direct submission. previously predicted to encode a protein with a deduced molecular mass of 42 kDa required for protein synthesis.2 We refer to the protein encoded byMPT1 as TAF48p. Interestingly, BLAST search analysis revealed that the C-terminal region of TAF48p bears significant similarity to the conserved C termini of metazoan dTAF110p, hTAF130p, and hTAF105p (Fig. 2). This result was quite unexpected, because previous BLAST search analysis of the complete S. cerevisiae genome with dTAF110p and hTAF130p sequence had not revealed an obvious sequence homologue. In retrospect, however, this result may not be surprising, because the region of similarity between TAF48p and its metazoan counterparts is quite small. To confirm the identity of TAF48p and TAF65p in TFIID, recombinant protein and affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies directed against either TAF48p or TAF65p were generated. Immunoblotting of the HATBP and HATAF130p TFIID fractions shown in Fig. 1 B indicated that the antibodies specifically recognized the appropriate polypeptides identified by mass spectroscopy (data not shown). To further test whether TAF65p and TAF48p where indeed TFIID TAF subunits, immunoprecipitations were performed with either anti-Flag or anti-HA antibodies utilizing whole cell extracts prepared from yeast strains with either wt (untagged) or HA3-tagged alleles of MPT1 (TAF48) or TAF65. It is important to note that the genomic copy of each allele harbors the HA3 tag, thus the epitope-tagged allele is the sole source of either TAF48p or TAF65p in the cell. AHA 3 TAF25 strain was utilized as a control. Immunoblotting with anti-HA indicated that each HA3-tagged protein was specifically precipitated with anti-HA antibody but not with the control anti-Flag antibody (data not shown). Immunoblotting of precipitates indicated that TFIID subunits TBP, TAF130p, TAF90p, TAF67p, TAF61p, TAF60p, TAF47p, TAF40p, TAF25p, TAF19p, and TAF17p were specifically co-immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody from each HA3-tagged strain (Fig.3 and data not shown). Importantly, no TFIID subunits were precipitated by anti-HA antibody from the untaggedwt strain (Fig. 3). Together, these results strongly argue that both TAF48p and TAF65p are indeed integral TAF subunits of TFIID. Additionally, Superose-6 size fractionation of the crude whole cell extract used for TFIID purification revealed that TAF48p and TAF65p co-eluted with other TFIID TAF subunits in a single peak of ∼1.7 MDa (data not shown). In this size fractionation assay no significant amount of either TAF48p or TAF65p was detected in the range of free TAFp, suggesting that TAF48p and TAF65p function only in the context of TFIID. In addition to the TFIID TBF·TAF complex, several other distinct TBF·TAF complexes have been identified (see Ref. 34.Lee T.I. Young R.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1398-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar for review). To test whether or not TAF48p and TAF65p are specific to TFIID, immunoprecipitations fromwt, HA3TAF48,HA3TAF65, and HA3TAF25strains were probed for Dr1p, a component of the NC2 TBF·TAF complex (35.Kim S. Na J.G. Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 820-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 36.Gadbois E.L. Chao D.M. Reese J.C. Green M.R. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3145-3150Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although present in the input, Dr1p was not detected in the precipitate from any strain (Fig. 3). To further test the specificity of TAF48p and TAF65p, immunoprecipitations were performed fromHA3TAF25, HA3MOT1, andHA3BRF1 strains as described above. Mot1p is in a TBF·TAF complex distinct from TFIID (37.Poon D. Campbell A.M. Bai Y. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23135-23140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Brf1p is a TAF subunit of the RNAP III-specific GTF TFIIIB (33.Poon D. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15325-15328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Kassavetis G.A. Joazeiro C.A. Pisano M. Geiduschek E.P. Colbert T. Hahn S. Blanco J.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 1055-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). As expected, TBP was specifically co-immunoprecipitated from each HA3-tagged strain with anti-HA antibody (Fig.4 A). However, TAF48p and TAF65p were specifically co-immunoprecipitated with only HA3TAF25p (Fig. 4 A). These results indicate that TAF48p and TAF65p are specific to the TFIID TBF·TAF complex. Because a subset of TAFs (TAF90p, TAF61p, TAF60p, TAF25p, and TAF17p) have been identified as subunits of the yeast histone acetylase SAGA complex (11.Grant P.A. Schieltz D. Pray-Grant M.G. Steger D.J. Reese J.C. Yates III, J.R. Workman J.L. Cell. 1998; 94: 45-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), we tested whether or not TAF48p and TAF65p were SAGA components. Immunoprecipitations from wt,HA3TAF48, HA3TAF65, andHA3TAF25 strains were probed for Gcn5p, the histone acetylase component of SAGA (39.Grant P.A. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Whereas Gcn5p specifically co-immunoprecipitated with HA3TAF25p, an integral subunit of both TFIID and SAGA, Gcn5p was not associated with either HA3TAF48p or HA3TAF65p (Fig. 3). Additionally, both TAF90p and TAF60p, but not TAF48p or TAF65p, were specifically co-immunoprecipitated by anti-HA antibody from a strain that harbors an HA3ADA3 allele as the sole source of Ada3p in the cell (Fig. 4 B). Ada3p is an integral subunit of the SAGA complex (39.Grant P.A. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Together these results strongly argue that TAF48p and TAF65p are not components of the yeast histone acetylase SAGA complex. Here we describe the use of a combination of ion exchange and immunoaffinity chromatography to purify the GTF TFIID from S. cerevisiae. Yeast TFIID is composed of TBP plus 14 distinct TAF subunits. A comparison of yeast TFIID with known metazoan TFIID subunits indicates that two yeast TAF subunits, TAF47p and TAF65p, currently do not have known metazoan homologues (TableI). Given the high conservation of TAFs in general, it is likely that metazoan homologues to yeast TAF47p and TAF65p will be identified. Two of the TAF subunits of yeast TFIID, TAF48p and TAF65p, are novel, and experiments presented here clearly demonstrate that both TAF48p and TAF65p are indeed bona fide TAFs. Moreover, these TAFs are specific to the TFIID TBF·TAF complex and are not shared subunits of the SAGA complex. Together these results represent a concise attempt to biochemically define TFIID from S. cerevisiae. Several lines of evidence argue that the TFIID presented here is the major form of TFIID in S. cerevisiae. First, purification of TFIID from either HATBP- or HATAF130p-expressing yeast strains yielded TFIID preparations of identical polypeptide composition (Fig. 1). Second, immunoblotting indicated that TFIID eluted in a single peak from the Mono S column and TFIID TAF subunits eluted only in the TFIID peak (data not shown). Third, the major fraction (70–100%) of those TFIID TAF subunits previously believed to be specific to TFIID (TAF130p, TAF67p, TAF47p, TAF40p, and TAF19p) were recovered in the 1m Bio-Rex 70 fraction used for immunopurification (data not shown). Finally, immunoprecipitation of any one TFIID subunit from the 1 m Bio-Rex 70 fraction co-immunoprecipitated all other TFIID subunits in similar relative amounts (data not shown). It is important to note however, that our data does not rule out the possibility of other TFIID subunits, which are either loosely associated or substoichiometric. Additionally, the experiments presented here do not fully address the possibility of another, as yet, unidentified TFIID TAF-containing complex(es). Further biochemical studies will be required to address these possibilities. The identification of a yeast equivalent to metazoan dTAF110p and hTAF130p, TAF48p, has important implications in terms of TFIID structure and function. It is interesting to speculate that, like its metazoan counterparts, yTAF48p may be a key cofactor in mediating transactivation by glutamine-rich activators. However, it is important to note that the N-terminal regions of dTAF110p and hTAF130p, which have been shown to be critical for mediating Sp1 activation (18.Hoey T. Weinzierl R.O.J. Gill G. Chen J.L. Dynlacht B.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 72: 247-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 19.Tanese N. Saluja D. Vassallo M.F. Chen J.L. Admon A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13611-13616Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), are not present in yTAF48p. Additionally, the glutamine-rich domain of the native yeast activator Hap2p can stimulate transcription in yeast equally well whether the reporter gene of interest is on a high copy plasmid or integrated into the genome. Stimulation of transcription by metazoan Sp1 requires the reporter gene to be carried on a high copy plasmid (21.Xiao H. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22873-22876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These results suggest that, if TAF48p is a co-activator for glutamine-rich activators in yeast, the mechanism of action is not highly conserved. With the recent identification of a potentially novel histone-like pair between hTAF20p (similar to yTAF61p) and hTAF130p (22.Gangloff Y.G. Werten S. Romier C. Carre L. Poch O. Moras D. Davidson I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 340-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), it is easy to speculate that TAF48p is the heterodimeric partner of TAF61p in yeast TFIID. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the region of highest conservation between yTAF48p and its metazoan counterparts is in the region of the putative histone-fold motif (Fig. 2). Furthermore, overexpression of TAF48p, but not other TFIID subunits, specifically suppresses the temperature-sensitive phenotype of a taf61strain. 3I. Davidson, personal communication.. 4S. Buratowski, personal communication. Additional studies will be required to formally prove this hypothesis. It is intriguing that the potential dimeric partner of TAF61p is different in TFIID (TAF48p) and SAGA (Ada1p; see Ref. 22.Gangloff Y.G. Werten S. Romier C. Carre L. Poch O. Moras D. Davidson I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 340-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this could be that interactions between the histone-folds in these molecules could provide a key determinant in the formation of either TFIID or SAGA. Shared TAF subunits (TAF90p, TAF61p, TAF60p, TAF25p, and TAF17p) could form a structural scaffold upon which either TFIID or SAGA could be formed. Interactions between TAF61p and its TFIID-specific (TAF48p) or SAGA-specific (Ada1p) dimeric partner could further direct formation of the complete TFIID or SAGA complex. This possibility is supported by in vivo studies that suggest inactivation of a shared TAF subunit disrupts the integrity of both the TFIID and SAGA complexes (7.Michel B. Komarnitsky P. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 663-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 10.Sanders S.L. Klebanow E.R. Weil P.A. J. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 94: 45-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This possibility is not limited to yeast, because sharing of TAFp subunits has also been reported between human TFIID and the PCAF histone acetylase complex (40.Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schlitz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Further biochemical and genetic studies will be crucial in investigating these possibilities as well as other aspects of TFIID structure and function to dissect the complex process of TFIID-mediated RNAP II gene transcription. We thank our laboratory colleagues for their constructive criticism and advice throughout the course of these studies as well as for their generous sharing of reagents.

To evaluate the functional link between adhesion and proteolysis in gingival keratinocytes (pp126), cells were treated with immobilized integrin antibodies to induce integrin clustering. Clustering of α3 and β1 integrin subunits, but not α2, α5, α6, or β4, enhanced uPA secretion. Bead-immobilized laminin-5 and collagen I, two major α3β1 ligands, also induced uPA expression. Coordinate regulation of the serpin plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 was also apparent; however, a net increase in uPA activity was predominant. α3β1 integrin clustering induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation, and both uPA induction and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation were blocked by the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059. Integrin aggregation also promoted a dramatic redistribution of uPAR on the cell surface to sites of clustered α3β1 integrins. Co-immunoprecipitation of β1 integrin with uPAR provided further evidence that protein-protein interactions between uPAR and β1 integrin control uPAR distribution. As a functional consequence of uPA up-regulation and uPA-mediated plasminogen activation, the globular domain of the laminin-5 α3subunit, a major pp126 matrix protein, was proteolytically processed from a 190-kDa form to a 160-kDa species. Laminin-5 containing the 160-kDa α3 subunit efficiently nucleates hemidesmosome formation and reduces cell motility.

Kjoller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). uPA is secreted by numerous cell types, and up-regulation of uPA expression has been correlated with malignant progression of a wide variety of neoplasms (1Andreasen P.A. Kjoller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). The biological activity of uPA is regulated posttranslationally by a functional interplay between the proteinase, its receptor (uPA receptor (uPAR)), and the serpin plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). uPAR is tethered in the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety and has been postulated to play a critical role in the initiation of extracellular matrix proteolysis by spatially concentrating uPA at the cell-matrix interface. Receptor-bound uPA (designated uPA/R) catalyzes plasmin formation and is also inhibited by PAI-1, leading to endocytosis of uPAR/uPA/PAI-1 complexes (1Andreasen P.A. Kjoller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored uPAR can form lateral associations with transmembrane integrins (2Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C.

Todd R.F. Petty H.R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1682-1689PubMed Google Scholar). Integrins are αβ heterodimeric proteins that function in cell-matrix adhesion and participate in diverse biological processes, including migration, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (6Humphries M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 7Boudreau N.J. Jones P.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Because integrin cytoplasmic domains can couple to both cytoskeletal and signaling proteins, integrin engagement can control a hierarchy of subcellular events based on the physical nature of the specific ligand-receptor interaction. Integrin binding by an ECM ligand can result in receptor occupancy, aggregation, or both, thus functionally coupling the extracellular environment to the actin-based cytoskeleton and to specific signal transduction pathways that modulate distinct cellular responses (8Miyamato S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Silvio-Gutkind J. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar, 9Miyamato S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M.

Furthermore, recent studies report that uPAR ligation may result in modulation of integrin signaling, suggesting a potential mechanism whereby uPA/R may participate in regulation of cell cycle progression and cell motility (7Boudreau N.J. Jones P.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 11Wei Y. Yang X. Liu Q. Wilkins J.A. Chapman H.A. J.

Cell Res. 1999; 250: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Integrin engagement has been shown to regulate expression of numerous gene products (6Humphries M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 7Boudreau N.J. Jones P.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar); however, the contribution of integrins to modulation of uPA/R expression is inconclusive. In the current study, we evaluated the functional link between cell-matrix adhesion and proteolysis in premalignant oral keratinocytes. We report that aggregation of α3β1 integrins exerts multifunctional control on the uPA system by inducing expression of uPA and PAI-1 as well as regulating the membrane localization of uPAR. Integrin-induced uPA expression requires extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation and is blocked by treatment with a MEK inhibitor. As a functional consequence of integrin-induced activation of the uPA/plasmin system, limited proteolytic modification of endogenous matrix-associated laminin-5 was observed, providing support for the hypothesis that integrin-mediated adhesion regulates matrix proteolysis and subsequent cellular behavior. Gelatin, BSA, type I collagen, type IV collagen, fibronectin, laminin-1, aprotinin, cycloheximide, herbimycin, actinomycin D, N-hydroxy-succinimidobiotin,d-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanlilde, peroxidase conjugates of anti-mouse IgG and anti-goat IgG, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Sigma. Laminin-5 was generously provided by Desmos (San Diego, CA). Plasminogen and plasmin were purified by affinity chromatography from outdated human plasma as described previously (18Stack S. Gonzalez-Gronow M. Pizzo S.V. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4966-4970Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Anti-human integrin β1 (clone P4C10), α5 (P1D6), and β4 (3E1) monoclonal antibodies were products of Life Technologies, Inc. Antibodies against α2 (MAB1988) and α3 integrin (MAB2056) were obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA), and anti-α6 (GOH3) was from Coulter. Laminin-5 subunit-specific monoclonal antibodies were derived as described previously (13Goldfinger L.E. Stack M.S. Jones J.C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Antibody EM11 recognizes an epitope present in both processed (160 kDa) and unprocessed (190 kDa) human laminin-5 α3 subunit, whereas antibody 12C4 is directed against the α3 G5 subdomain and thus detects only the intact 190-kDa α subunit. Affinity-purified polyclonal antibody specific for phosphorylated p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (anti-ACTIVER® MAPK p42/p44) was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Anti-ERK1/2 (anti-p42/p44), which recognizes both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated p42/p44, was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The MEK1 inhibitor PD98059, which selectively inhibits the MAPK cascade, was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin were purchased from Calbiochem (Cambridge, MA). uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 ELISA kits, as well as anti-human uPAR antibodies (3936, 3937, and 399R), anti-PAI-1 (395G), and anti-catalytic uPA antibodies (394), were obtained from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). Hydrobond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and SuperSignal enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and Pierce, respectively. Premalignant oral keratinocytes (pp126 cells) were a gift from Dr. D. Oda (University of Washington, Seattle, WA) (14Oda D. Bigler L. Lee P. Blanton R. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 226: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). pp126 cells were obtained by immortalization of normal human gingival keratinocytes with HPV16 DNA. These cells do not stratify in liquid-air interphase organotypic culture models; however, they display normal keratin synthesis and some degree of differentiation and are representative of a premalignant transformation to oral squamous cell carcinoma (15Rheinwald J.G. Beckett M.A. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 1657-1663PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Keratinocyte-SFM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 20 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 5 ng/ml EGF, and 50 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract (BPE) (14Oda D. Bigler L. Lee P. Blanton R. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 226: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Prior to treatments, cell monolayers were released from culture flasks by the addition of trypsin/EDTA, seeded at a constant density of 0.7 × 105 cells/well into 24-well tissue culture plates, and allowed to attach overnight in the medium described above. Cells were then washed twice with PBS, incubated for 1 h in medium lacking BPE and EGF, and supplemented with fresh BPE-/EGF-free medium prior to treatment with soluble antibodies (5–10 μg/ml), antibody-conjugated latex beads (8–10 μg/ml), or protein-conjugated latex beads as indicated below. Following incubation, conditioned media were collected for uPA activity determination, ELISA analyses, and Western blotting as described below. Cell lysates were prepared using 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS. Total protein concentration of lysates was analyzed using a bicinchoninic acid protein detection kit (Sigma). In some experiments, actinomycin D, herbimycin, genistein (in Me2SO), or cycloheximide (in culture medium) was added to culture wells 30 min prior to the introduction of integrin antibodies. Cells were found to be >95% viable by exclusion of trypan blue at the highest concentrations of all the inhibitors. Adhesive preferences of pp126 cells were analyzed by evaluating cellular adhesion to ECM-coated 24-well culture plates as described previously (16Moser T.L. Pizzo S.V. Bafetti L.M. Fishman D.A. Stack M.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, plates were coated by passive adsorption with the ECM proteins collagen I, collagen IV, fibronectin, laminin-1, laminin-5, or bovine serum albumin (as control), washed with PBS, and blocked by incubating the plates at 37 °C with minimum Eagle's medium containing 3% BSA immediately before use. pp126 cells (105) were seeded in BPE/EGF-free medium and allowed to adhere for 45 min at 37 °C. After washing, bound cells were fixed with 50% methanol/50% acetone (–20 °C) and enumerated with an ocular micrometer by counting a minimum of 10 high powered fields. Adhesion assays were performed in duplicate and repeated three times. Anti-integrin subunit-specific monoclonal antibodies or control isotype-matched IgGs were passively adsorbed onto 2.97-μm latex beads (Sigma) as described (9Miyamato S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Science. 1995; 267: 883-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. A 1% (final concentration) suspension of latex beads was incubated in 50 mm 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid buffer (pH 6.1) with 75 μg/ml of the appropriate antibody overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation (17Ellerbroek S.M. Fishman D.A. Kearns A.S. Bafetti L.M. Stack M.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1635-1641PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody-conjugated beads were blocked with 10 mg/ml BSA for 90 min at room temperature, centrifuged for 3 min at 3000 rpm, and washed twice by resuspension in 2 volumes of culture medium. Bead-immobilized antibodies were resuspended in BPE/EGF-free medium at a final concentration of 1% by volume. Determination of total protein concentration in unblocked bead suspensions using a bicinchoninic acid detection kit (Sigma) indicated that 60–70% of immunoglobulins were adsorbed, resulting in a final concentration of 8–10 μg/ml antibody beads in culture wells. The same protocol was used to generate collagen I-, laminin-1-, or laminin-5-conjugated beads. Net plasminogen activator activity in conditioned media was quantified using a coupled assay to monitor plasminogen activation and the resulting plasmin hydrolysis of a colorimetric substrate (d-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanlilde) as described previously (18Stack S. Gonzalez-Gronow M. Pizzo S.V. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4966-4970Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Control reactions contained 10 μg/ml of the anti-catalytic uPA antibody 398 (American Diagnostica). Levels of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 in conditioned media and cell lysates were quantified by ELISA (American Diagnostica) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Statistical analyses were performed using Graph Pad Prizm. Qualitative analysis of PAI-1 antigen levels was provided by Western blotting. Briefly, samples were electrophoresed on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar), electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (20Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and blocked overnight at 4 °C with Tris-buffered saline containing 3% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). Blots were probed with anti-human PAI-1 antibody (1:2000, 2 h), washed (six times, 10 min each) with TBST, and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary IgG (1:10,000) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence detection. Untreated cells were plated on 22-mm2 glass coverslips placed into six-well tissue culture plates (1.5 × 105 cells/well), cultured overnight, washed with PBS, and treated with antibody-conjugated latex beads (α3, β1, or IgG beads) in BPE/EGF-free medium for 4 h. Coverslips were then gently washed with PBS, and cells were fixed for 15 min at room temperature with 3.7% formaldehyde. Coverslips were blocked for 45 min with PBS containing 1% BSA, followed by the addition of biotinylated anti-human uPAR monoclonal antibody 3936 (1:200, 1 h, room temperature). After washing (three times, 10 min each with PBS containing 1% BSA), streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate solution was added, and coverslips were gently agitated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark and washed as described above. Control coverslips included cells treated with α3 beads followed by streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate in the absence of biotinylated anti-uPAR. Mounted coverslips were viewed using a Zeiss Confocal LSM510 microscope. pp126 cells were cultured in 24-well plates coated by passive adsorption with collagen I, fibronectin, or BSA (16Moser T.L.

Lysates (500 μg) were incubated with anti-uPAR antibody (5 μg, antibody 3937, American Diagnostica) in a total volume of 1 ml at 4 °C overnight. Immune complexes were precipitated by the addition of 30 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G beads (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 2500 rpm. Pelleted protein G complexes were washed five times in cold lysis buffer, resuspended in 35 μl of Laemmli sample dilution buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol, and boiled. Samples were electrophoresed on duplicate 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described above. Blots were probed with either biotinylated anti-uPAR (1:200 dilution, antibody 399R, American Diagnostica) followed by streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase or with anti-β1integrin monoclonal antibodies (1:1000 dilution, P4C10) followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat-(anti-mouse) secondary antibodies (1:5000). Blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence detection. To evaluate ERK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) activation, cells (0.7 × 105) were cultured overnight in serum-free medium followed by treatment with IgG, α3, or β1 beads as described above. At varying time points, cells were lysed with RIPA buffer including 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (21Berditchevski F. Chang S. Bodorova J. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29174-29180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and extracted on ice for 20 min. The lysates were centrifuged, protein concentration determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit, and equal amounts of cellular protein (20 μg) were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted to Immobilon. Blots were probed with anti-ERK1/2 antibody (1:1000) to detect total ERK1/2 expression or with anti-ACTIVE-MAPK p42/p44 (1:5000) to detect the phosphorylated, active forms of ERK. In control experiments, ERK activation was blocked using the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (2 μm), and both ERK activation and β1bead-stimulated uPA expression were evaluated as described above. The major protein component of the pp126 matrix is the heterotrimeric protein laminin-5 (13Goldfinger L.E. Stack M.S. Jones J.C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The integrity of the laminin-5 α3 subunit in pp126 matrix following treatment of cells with α3 or β1 integrin-conjugated latex beads was evaluated by Western blotting of extracted matrix proteins as described previously (13Goldfinger L.E. Stack M.S. Jones J.C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured for 48 h to permit matrix accumulation and then treated with anti-α3 or β1 integrin beads (to induce uPA expression) or control IgG beads for 20 h. Plasminogen (0.02 μm) was added to the culture medium for 30 min, and matrices were solubilized in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 8 m urea, 1% SDS, and 15% β-mercaptoethanol (22Gospodarowicz D. Delgado D. Vlodavsky I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4094-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described above, and probed with laminin-5 α3 subunit-specific monoclonal antibodies EM11 (1:500) or 12C4 (1:1000). Blots were then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence detection. To identify the integrins that mediate binding of pp126 cells to ECM proteins, adhesive profiles were evaluated. Preferential adhesion to laminin-5 and interstitial type I collagen was observed (Fig.1), implicating β1integrins in cell-matrix binding. Adhesion to laminin-5 and collagen I was efficiently blocked by an inhibitory β1 integrin antibody (10 μg/ml), and both immunocytochemical staining and Western blotting of cell membrane extracts confirmed the expression of β1 integrins (data not shown). Integrin binding by an ECM ligand can induce distinct cellular events based on the physical nature of the specific ligand-receptor interaction. To mimic cellular interaction with a three-dimensional matrix and promote multivalent integrin aggregation, cells were treated with β1 integrin subunit-specific monoclonal antibodies immobilized on latex beads (designated β1 beads). β1 beads bound avidly to pp126 cells (Fig. 2,B and D) relative to the loosely adherent IgG-coated control beads (Fig. 2, A and C). To confirm that β1 beads bound to β1integrins, bead-treated cells were lysed with modified RIPA buffer, and beads were precipitated by centrifugation. Western blot analysis of proteins co-precipitating with β1 beads demonstrated the presence of β1 integrins (data not shown).Figure 2Binding of β1 integrin antibody-conjugated beads to pp126 cells. Latex beads were coated with control IgG (IgG beads) (A and C) or β1integrin antibody clone P4C10 (β1 beads) (B and D). Beads (8–10 μg/ml) were added to pp126 cells (105/well) in 25-well culture plates and allowed to attach for 2 h prior to examination by phase contrast microscopy at the indicated magnifications.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether β1 integrin aggregation regulates proteinase expression, cells were incubated with β1 or control IgG beads for 12–48 h. Conditioned medium was evaluated for uPA expression by ELISA and uPA activity using a coupled colorimetric plasminogen activation assay. A significant increase in both uPA protein and activity was observed in the conditioned medium of β1 bead-treated pp126 cells (Fig.3, solid bars) relative to IgG beads (Fig. 3, hatched bars) or untreated cells (Fig. 3,open bars). In control experiments, activity was completely blocked by preincubating with a uPA-specific anti-catalytic antibody (Fig. 3), confirming that the induced protease was uPA. Induction of uPA was detectable as early as 6 h after treatment with β1 beads and was maximal at 24–36 h. To determine whether multivalent aggregation of β1 integrins is required to induce uPA expression, pp126 cells were treated with soluble antibodies to promote divalent integrin engagement. No significant change in uPA activity was observed (TableI), suggesting that β1integrin aggregation, rather than simple integrin occupation, is necessary for uPA induction.Table IEffect of soluble β1 integrin antibodies on uPA expressionTreatmentuPA Activity (fold increase)24 h48 hControl1.0001.000IgG (5 μg/ml)0.861 ± 0.0370.723 ± 0.136IgG (10 μg/ml)0.773 ± 0.0840.903 ± 0.095β1 (5 μg/ml)0.986 ± 0.1020.856 ± 0.227β1 (10 μg/ml)0.993 ± 0.0900.847 ± 0.069Cells (0.7 × 105) were cultured with soluble β1integrin antibodies or isotype-matched control IgG for 24 or 48 h.

To assess the effect of α subunit aggregation on uPA activity, latex beads were coated with antibodies directed against the α2, α3, α5, or α6 integrin subunits and incubated with pp126 cells as described above, and the conditioned medium was analyzed for uPA activity. In control experiments, cells were incubated with either β1 or β4 beads. Although all α subunit beads bound to pp126 cells, only α3 and β1beads enhanced uPA activity, whereas the remaining samples were indistinct from IgG controls (Table II), suggesting that the α3β1 integrin regulates uPA expression in pp126 cells.Table IIEffect of integrin α subunit aggregation on uPA inductionTreatmentuPA activityFold increaseControl1.0IgG1.167 ± 0.058α20.933 ± 0.153α32.067 ± 0.2082-aP < 0.001 relative to untreated control.α51.067 ± 0.153α60.987 ± 0.103β12.160 ± 0.2502-aP < 0.001 relative to untreated control.β41.000 ± 0.089Cells (0.7 × 105) were cultured for 18 h with integrin α subunit-specific monoclonal antibodies conjugated to latex beads as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Control experiments included beads conjugated with β subunits or isotype-matched IgG.

As modulation of PAI-1 levels may alter uPA function (1Andreasen P.A. Kjoller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar), the effect of integrin clustering on PAI-1 expression was evaluated by Western blotting (Fig. 4 A) and ELISA (Fig. 4 B). Similar to results observed with uPA, aggregation of either α3 or β1 integrin resulted in increased PAI-1 expression. However, as shown in Fig. 3, a net increase in uPA activity was apparent, indicative of an overall imbalance in the uPA:PAI-1 ratio in favor of uPA. Because uPAR binding is a primary mechanism for posttranslational control of uPA activity (1Andreasen P.A. Kjoller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J.

MIP-T3 is a 83-kDa protein with no significant homology to known mammalian proteins. MIP-T3 mRNA and TRAF3 mRNA are ubiquitously expressed, and TRAF3 is the only TRAF protein to interact with MIP-T3. The MIP-T3-TRAF3 interaction requires the coiled-coil TRAF-N domain of TRAF3. To our knowledge, this is the first case of a TRAF-binding protein that interacts with a single member of the TRAF family specifically through a TRAF-N coiled-coil domain. MIP-T3 binds to Taxol-stabilized microtubules and to tubulin in vitro, and MIP-T3 recruits TRAF3 to microtubules when both proteins are overexpressed in HeLa cells. In a 293 cell line stably expressing CD40, TRAF3 is released from the TRAF3·MIP-T3 complex and recruited to the CD40 receptor upon CD40 ligand stimulation. MIP-T3 may provide a novel mechanism in sequestering TRAF3 to the cytoskeletal network.

TRAF2-deficient mice have elevated levels of serum TNF. Ex vivo assays demonstrated that TRAF2–/– embryonic fibroblasts are highly sensitive to TNF-induced cell death and that in the absence of TRAF2, TNF-mediated c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation is greatly reduced. TRAF2 deficiency results in partial inhibition of TNF-induced NF-κB activation, and complete inhibition of CD40-induced NF-κB activation (18Yeh W.C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F.

Recent studies on TRAF6–/– mice revealed that TRAF6 is required for interleukin 1, CD40, and lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-κB activation (23Lomaga M.A. Yeh W.C. Sarosi I. Duncan G.S. Furlonger C.

Moreover, TRAF6-deficient mice are osteopetrotic, with defects in bone remodeling and tooth eruption due to impaired osteoclast function (23Lomaga M.A. Yeh W.C. Sarosi I. Duncan G.S. Furlonger C. Ho A. Morony S. Capparelli C. Van G. Kaufman S. van der Heiden A. Itie A. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Sasaki T. Cao Z. Penninger J.M. Paige C.J. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Boyle W.J. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Unlike TRAF2-, TRAF3-, and TRAF6-deficient mice, TRAF5–/– mice are healthy through 24 weeks of age, but the CD40 and CD27 signaling pathways are impaired in these mice (22Nakano H. Sakon S. Koseki H. Takemori T. Tada K. Matsumoto M. Munechika E. Sakai T. Shirasawa T. Akiba H. Kobata T. Santee S.M. Ware C.F. Rennert P.D. Taniguchi M. Yagita H. Okumura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Collectively, these results suggested that TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 could act redundantly or specifically in particular signaling cascades. TRAF3 was originally identified as a molecule that binds the cytoplasmic domains of the TNFR family member CD40 and the Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein LMP1 (4Hu H.M. O'Rourke K.

The interaction of TRAF3 with both CD40 and LTβR has been shown to be ligand-dependent and to occur in nontransfected cells (33Kuhne M.R. Robbins M. Hambor J.E. Mackey M.F. Kosaka Y. Nishimura T.

However, deletion of TRAF3 by gene targeting does not seem to affect either CD40-induced B cell proliferation or CD23 up-regulation in mice (21Xu Y. Cheng G. Baltimore D. Immunity. 1996; 5: 407-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), nor do TRAF3-deficient mice have defective lymph node genesis as seen in LTβR-knockout mice (21Xu Y. Cheng G. Baltimore D. Immunity. 1996; 5: 407-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, reconstitution of mice with TRAF3–/– fetal liver cells revealed a requirement for TRAF3 in T cell-dependent immune responses (21Xu Y. Cheng G. Baltimore D. Immunity. 1996; 5: 407-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To gain more insights about the physiological roles of TRAF3, we performed yeast two-hybrid cloning to search for TRAF3-interacting proteins. We identified a novel protein, MIP-T3, that is endogenously associated with TRAF3 and that appears to provide a link between TRAF3 and the microtubule network. Taxol, nocodazole, anti-Flag monoclonal antibody M2, anti-tubulin, and FITC- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Anti-Myc, anti-Flag, anti-TRAF3, and anti-CD40 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The rabbit anti-MIP-T3 antiserum was raised against a 35-mer peptide, KKILETKKDYEKLQQSPKPGEKERSLFESAWKKEK, and was affinity-purified (Covance). Mammalian expression vectors encoding TRAFs 1–6 have been described (16Song H.Y. Regnier C.H. Kirschning C.J. Goeddel D.V. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). MIP-T3 was expressed as N-terminally tagged Flag or Myc fusion proteins using the pRK vector. Deletion mutants of MIP-T3 and TRAF3 were generated by polymerase chain reaction. DNA encoding full-length TRAF3 was used as a bait in the MATCHMAKER LexA two-hybrid system (CLONTECH). The two-hybrid screening was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions except that a pretransformed HeLa cDNA library (generously provided by Dr. Hsing-Jien Kung) was used. Positive yeast clones were selected by prototrophy for leucine and expression of β-galactosidase. Yeast DNA was recovered and transformed into Escherichia coli. Plasmids containing cDNA clones were identified by restriction mapping and further characterized by DNA sequencing. The 1-kb cDNA insert from the partial two-hybrid MIP-T3 clone was used as a probe to screen human HeLa cDNA library in λZap (provided by Dr. Z. Cao) by standard methods. DNA sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems automated DNA sequencer. Northern blot analysis of the human multiple tissue blot (CLONTECH) was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer, using a 1-kbEcoRI-EcoRI fragment from the MIP-T3 cDNA as probe. 293 cells or HeLa cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids using the calcium phosphate method. 24–36 h later, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Lysis Buffer A containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the CompleteTM protease inhibitors (Roche). Cell lysates were cleared and incubated for 2–4 h at 4 °C with anti-Flag M2 antibody or control mouse IgG and Gamma-Bind G Plus-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The Sepharose beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Immunoblotting analyses were performed with various polyclonal antibodies and detected by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad), horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), or horseradish peroxidase-coupled protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For detecting full-length MIP-T3 association with TRAFs 1–6 when cotransfected in 293 cells, the cells were transfected and processed as above except that Lysis Buffer B (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complete protease inhibitors) was used. For GST pull-down assays, the GST fusion proteins (GST-TRAF3 and GST-MIP-T3 [aa 324–625]) were expressed in bacteria after isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction using the pGEX vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and purified on glutathione beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Full-length and deletion mutants of TRAF3 and MIP-T3 were in vitrotranslated using the TNTTM SP6-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). 10 μl of in vitro translation products were diluted to 400 μl with Lysis Buffer A and incubated with 2 μg of GST or GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione beads. The samples were then washed extensively, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and exposed to x-ray films. For detection of the endogenous interaction of TRAF3 with MIP-T3, untransfected HeLa cells, 293 cells, or 293.CD40 cells (a 293 cell line stably expressing Flag-tagged CD40, generously provided by Dr. Ralf Schwandner) were not stimulated or stimulated with a 250μg/ml-membrane preparation of CD40 ligand (35Warren W.D. Berton M.T. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5637-5646PubMed Google Scholar) for various times. The cells were then lysed in Lysis Buffer A. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using affinity-purified rabbit-anti-MIP-T3 antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-TRAF3 antibodies. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with various plasmids. When indicated, 8 h after transfection, cells were treated with 5 μg/ml Taxol or 400 ng/ml nocodazole overnight. 24 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked with 10% goat serum. Then cells were incubated with various combinations of anti-Myc, anti-Flag, and/or anti-tubulin antibodies, followed by FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody and/or rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody, and examined under a Zeiss microscope at × 400 magnification. Cell images were captured with the Sensys CCD camera system (Photometrics) and analyzed by Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics) and Adobe Photoshop. MIP-T3 proteins were in vitro translated using the SP6 TNTTM-coupled reticulocyte lysate systems (Promega). Taxol-stabilized microtubules were assembled from dimeric tubulin (Cytoskeleton) in G-PEM buffer (80 mm Pipes (pH 6.8), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm GTP). The in vitro translated proteins were incubated with microtubules at room temperature for 20 min, loaded onto cushion buffer (PEM buffer plus 40% glycerol) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min at room temperature. The pellets were washed with G-PEM and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For GST fusion protein pull-down tubulin assay, 5 μg of immobilized GST protein, GST-MIP-T3 (full-length), GST-MIP-T3 (aa 324–625), GST-MIP-T3 (aa 1–525), and GST-MIP-T3 (aa 1–425) were incubated with 2 μg of tubulin in Lysis Buffer A at 4 °C. After extensive washing, tubulin bound on immobilized GST fusion proteins was detected by immunoblotting with anti-tubulin antibody. To increase our understanding of the function of TRAF3, we performed yeast two-hybrid interaction cloning to screen for proteins that associate directly with TRAF3. An expression vector in which full-length TRAF3 was fused to the LexA DNA binding domain was used as a bait to screen a HeLa cDNA library (36Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). From approximately 10 million transformants, 10 independent positive clones were obtained, as determined by activation of LeuandLacZreporter genes. One of these clones encodes I-TRAF/TANK, a protein previously shown to be associated with various TRAFs (37Rothe M. Xiong J. Shu H.B. Williamson K. Goddard A. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8241-8246Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 38Cheng G. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Three of these clones were independent isolates encoding portions of a novel protein. The longest insert from these three clones contains an open reading frame encoding 302 amino acids. The interaction between TRAF3 and this 302 amino acid protein was verified by retransformation into yeast cells (data not shown). We screened a HeLa λZAP cDNA library using the partial cDNA as probe. DNA sequence analysis of the positive clones revealed an open reading frame predicted to encode a protein of 625 amino acids that we have designated MIP-T3, formicrotubule-interacting protein that associates with TRAF3 (Fig.1). Data base searches utilizing the BLAST and FASTA programs failed to identify any mammalian proteins having significant sequence similarity to MIP-T3. However, aCaenorhabditis elegans protein (GenBankTMaccession number U49945) of unknown function shares an overall 22% identity and 29% similarity to MIP-T3. The C-terminal 100 amino acids of MIP-T3 form a coiled-coil domain (aa 525–625). Northern blot analysis indicated that MIP-T3 mRNA was expressed in all human tissues examined (Fig.2 A). This result is consistent with MIP-T3 involvement in TRAF3 signal transduction, as TRAF3 is also expressed ubiquitously (6Mosialos G. Birkenbach M. Yalamanchili R. VanArsdale T. Ware C. Kieff E. Cell. 1995; 80: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 39Krajewski S. Zapata J.M. Krajewska M. VanArsdale T. Shabaik A. Gascoyne R.D. Reed J.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5841-5852PubMed Google Scholar). Two different sizes (4.4 and 2.4 kb) of MIP-T3 transcripts were visualized in most tissues on the Northern blots. The two transcripts encode the same open reading frame with the longer transcript having an extra 2 kb of 3′ untranslated region, as revealed from the sequences of MIP-T3 clones from the HeLa λZap cDNA library. In addition, testis contains an additional MIP-T3 transcript of 2.7 kb. Polyclonal antibody against MIP-T3 was generated by immunizing rabbits with a 35-mer peptide, KKILETKKDYEKLQQSPKPGEKERSLFESAWKKEK, derived from amino acids 476–510 of MIP-T3. Rabbit anti-MIP-T3 antiserum specifically recognized a protein of approximately 83 kDa in nontransfected 293, HeLa, and SW480 cells by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting with the same antibody (Fig. 2 B), which is the same size as the MIP-T3 expressed in transiently transfected 293 cells. We performed in vitro GST pull-down assays to confirm the interaction between MIP-T3 and TRAF3 observed in the two-hybrid system. All six TRAFs were 35S-labeled by in vitro translation using SP6 RNA polymerase. Equal amounts of TRAFs were incubated with GST or GST-MIP-T3 (aa 324–625) protein immobilized on glutathione beads. As shown in Fig.3 A, MIP-T3 strongly associated with TRAF3 but not with TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF4, or TRAF5. MIP-T3 also very weakly associated with TRAF6. The interaction of MIP-T3 with TRAF3 was further analyzed in mammalian cell coimmunoprecipitation assays. The full-length MIP-T3 construct containing an N-terminal Myc epitope tag was transiently coexpressed in 293 cells with Flag epitope-tagged TRAFs. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal antibody against the Flag epitope or control mouse IgG, and coprecipitating MIP-T3 was detected by immunoblotting analyses with anti-Myc polyclonal antibody (Fig. 3 B). In this assay, MIP-T3 specifically coprecipitates TRAF3 but not TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF4, TRAF5, or TRAF6, consistent with the results of the in vitro GST pull-down assay. TRAF3 contains a N-terminal ring finger domain followed by several zinc fingers (4Hu H.M. O'Rourke K. Boguski M.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1968895911,"Activation of death receptors initiates intrinsic apoptosis programs in various parts of the cell. To explore the possibility that ribosomal RNA (rRNA), essential for translation in ribosomes, is a target of pro-apoptotic proteins, rRNA was analyzed by electrophoresis in two apoptosis systems: human Jurkat cells treated with anti-Fas antibody and human U937 cells treated with tumor necrosis factor-α. In both systems, bands in addition to those of unmodified rRNA were detected a few hours after death receptor engagement. In both systems, the primary additional band was identical and comprised the 3′-terminal region of 28 S rRNA. The degradation of 28 S rRNA was simultaneous with protein synthesis inhibition in both systems. The caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK suppressed rRNA degradation and protein synthesis inhibition in Jurkat cells but not in U937 cells. Together, our data suggest that different pathways are activated in the two systems we studied, and the final steps in these pathways use very similar or identical ribonucleases to cleave 28 S rRNA. These data suggest a physiological link between rRNA degradation and inhibition of protein synthesis. In general, apoptosis execution initiated by death receptor engagement is promoted by protein synthesis inhibition. Triggered by rRNA degradation, malfunction of the protein synthesis machinery may prompt death execution.

Triggered by rRNA degradation, malfunction of the protein synthesis machinery may prompt death execution. tumor necrosis factor receptor caspase-3-activated deoxyribonuclease rapid amplification of cDNA ends ribonuclease ribosomal RNA N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine Death receptors are a unique group of transmembrane proteins that directly mediate cell death that is triggered by extracellular stimulants (1.Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5154) Google Scholar). Fas (CD95), tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1,1 CD120a), and p75 neurotrophin receptor are death receptors. These receptors have a homologous cytoplasmic sequence called the death domain and very similar cysteine-rich extracellular regions. Recently, the signal transducing molecules that are downstream from death receptors and trigger the cell's intrinsic apoptosis machinery have been studied. Two signaling pathways involving Fas have been reported: mitochondria-dependent pathway and mitochondria-independent pathway (2.Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinvasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar, 3.Los M. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 629-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In either pathway, downstream effector caspases such as caspase-3 are activated to initiate apoptosis. The activity of these two pathways varies between cell types and tissues. The pathway downstream of TNFR1 is more complicated than the pathway downstream of Fas because, depending on the intracellular environment, activation of this receptor can lead to apoptosis, necrosis-like cell death or a pro-inflammatory response. In addition, FAP-1 associated with death receptors modulates death signaling (4.Sato T. Irie S. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 5.Irie S.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) can initiate necrosis-like organized cell death (6.Kawahara A. Ohsawa Y. Matsumura H. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1353-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Analysis at the molecular level of cell death caused by death receptors improves our understanding of development, homeostasis, diseases, and cancer because apoptosis through death receptors plays a pivotal role in these phenomena (7.Vaux D.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 245-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar, 8.Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6191) Google Scholar, 9.Williams G.T. Cell. 1991; 65: 1097-1098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). At a particular point after an apoptotic insult, cells reach a decisive point, past which rescue from apoptosis is impossible (10.Samejima K. Tone S. Kottke T.J. Enari M. Sakahira H. Cooke C.A. Durrieu F. Martins L.M. Nagata S. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Once this point is passed, apoptosis enters the period termed the execution phase. One of the characteristics of the execution phase is irreversible degradation of cellular components, during which caspase-3-activated deoxyribonuclease (CAD) digests genomic DNA (11.Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2807) Google Scholar) and caspase-6 digests nuclear cytoskeleton lamin (12.Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar). These events contribute to the final morphologic change in the nucleus that is characteristic of apoptosis. In addition, caspase-3 digests some signaling proteins (12.Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar). Such irreversible degradations accelerate cell death. Therefore, to fully decipher the story of apoptosis, delineating the events at the onset of the execution phase is important. Protein synthesis is a characteristic of cell viability. In fact, inhibition of protein synthesis by drugs such as actinomycin-D causes apoptosis in some cell types (13.Wertz I.E. Hanley M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 359-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The ribosome is a large protein-RNA complex essential for protein synthesis. In humans, the ribosome (80 S) composes a large subunit, involving 46 proteins and 28 S, 5.8 S, and 5 S RNA species and a small subunit including 33 proteins and 18 S RNA (14.Wool I.G. Chan Y.L. Gluck A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 933-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Although ribosomal regulation in de novo protein synthesis has been the focus of many studies, work addressing its role in apoptosis had not been published previously. Ultrastructural analysis has shown that ribosomes dissociate from the rough endoplasmic reticulum during apoptosis of some tissues (15.Pilar G. Landmesser L. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 68: 339-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 16.Clarke P.G.H. Anat. Embryol. 1990; 181: 195-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar). Such morphologic studies encouraged us to pursue the molecular analysis of the ribosome during apoptosis. Because ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is an essential component for protein synthesis (17.Wilson K.S. Noller H.F. Cell. 1998; 92: 337-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we have examined in the present study the role of rRNA in apoptosis caused by activation of death receptors. Apoptosis induced by cAMP analogs features the degradation of rRNA (18.Houge G. Robaye B. Eikhom T.S. Golstein J. Mellgren G. Gjertsen B.T. Lanotte M. Doskeland S.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2051-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although some small drugs including cAMP analogs strongly induce apoptosis, their pleiotropic effects can complicate attempts to separate physiologic death pathways from unusual secondary pathways that are stimulated by side effects of the drugs. The molecular mechanisms and biologic significance of alterations in rRNA had not been investigated previously. Here we show that 28 S rRNA is selectively degraded by the same (or a very similar) ribonuclease (RNase) in the Jurkat and U937 systems. In addition, examination of the association between rRNA degradation and protein synthesis revealed the potential involvement of this degradation in the malfunction of protein synthesis machinery. The human T-cell leukemia cell line Jurkat (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and human monoblastic leukemia cell line U937 (DE-4; RIKEN Cell Bank, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan) were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Sanko Junyaku, Tokyo, Japan), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and grown in an atmosphere of 5% CO2at 37 °C. In the Fas-Jurkat system, Jurkat cells were washed once with serum-free RPMI 1640 and resuspended in the same medium. To induce apoptosis, a mouse monoclonal anti-Fas antibody (CH-11; MBL, Nagoya, Japan) was added at a concentration of 100 ng/ml, and the cells were incubated for various periods of time. Control cells were incubated under the same conditions but without CH-11. Cells incubated with 100 ng/ml unrelated mouse IgM (No. 02–6800; Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) were an additional control. In the TNFR-U937 system, U937 cells were washed once with serum-free RPMI 1640 and resuspended in the same medium. To induce apoptosis, recombinant human TNF-α (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was added at a concentration of 30 ng/ml, and the cells were incubated for various periods of time. Control cells were incubated under the same conditions but without TNF-α. To examine the effect of caspase-3 inhibition on apoptosis, cells were incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C in serum-free RPMI 1640 including a cell-permeable form of Z-DEVD-FMK (50 μm; caspase-3 inhibitor II; Calbiochem) that had been dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to create a stock solution at 50 mm, and then CH-11 or TNF-α was added to the cell culture. Control cells were treated with the same volume of dimethyl sulfoxide. Apoptosis was evaluated by using morphologic observation under a light microscope and the DNA fragmentation assay (see the following section). Fragmented DNA was extracted with Triton X-100-containing buffer (19.Toyoshima F. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and subjected to 1.4% agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide staining. Total RNA was isolated from cells by using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The concentration of the solution was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. Polyacrylamide (2.5%)-agarose (0.5%) composite gel electrophoresis was modified from the method of Peacock and Dingman (20.Peacock A.C. Dingman C.W. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). Distilled water (13 ml) was added to 75 mg of electrophoresis-grade agarose (Iwai Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan). After the agarose melted, the gel solution was cooled to about 40 °C. The following solutions then were added to the gel solution and mixed well: 0.75 ml of 0.8 m Tris, 0.49 m acetic acid, 20 mm EDTA (20× TAE buffer), 1.25 ml of 29% acrylamide, 1% N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide, 20 μl of TEMED, and 50 μl 10% ammonium persulfate. The mixture was then poured into the mold for the gel (thickness, 1.0 mm; width, 87 mm; length, 77 mm) and, after the insertion of a comb at the top of the mold, kept for 30 min at room temperature for polymerization of the polyacrylamide gel. To solidify the agarose and cool the composite gel, it then was kept at 4 °C for 1 h. RNA samples (2.5 μg of RNA/lane) were mixed with an equal volume of 90% (v/v) formamide, 10% (v/v) glycerol, incubated for 3 min at 65 °C, cooled for 5 min at room temperature, and then loaded onto the gel. Gels were run for 30 to 40 min at 200 V in 1× TAE buffer, which was precooled on ice; the gels then were stained with ethidium bromide. For Northern blotting after composite gel electrophoresis, RNA was electroblotted onto Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 25 mm Tris containing 0.19 m glycine by using the Mini Transblot Cell (Bio-Rad) at 0.3 A for 1 h and fixed by using the UV Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Oligodeoxyribonucleic acid probes were synthesized by ESPEC-OLIGO Service Corp. (Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan) and terminally labeled by using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara, Otsu, Shiga, Japan). The blots were prehybridized for 15 min in QuickHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene) and hybridized for 1 h with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe. The blots were washed with 0.1% SDS, 2× SSC (1× SSC: 15 mm sodium citrate containing 0.15m NaCl) followed by 0.1% SDS, 0.1× SSC and subjected to autoradiography with Kodak X-Omat films. Apoptotic RNA fragments were isolated by combining agarose gel electrophoresis with a “crush and soak” method involving phenol. 5′-RACE was performed with the 5′-RACE kit version 2.0 (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following reverse primers recognizing the human 28 S rRNA sequence (21.Gonzalez I.L. Gorski J.L. Campen T.J. Dorney D.J. Erickson J.M. Sylvester J.E. Schmickel R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7666-7670Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) were used: 5′-GCTCAACAGGGTCTTC-3′ (antisense of nucleotides 3873–3888) for first-strand cDNA synthesis and 5′-CACTGGGCAGAAATCACATC-3′ (antisense of nucleotides 3655–3674) for the subsequent polymerase chain reaction. The products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Amplified cDNA was isolated from the gels with the QIAQuick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and directly sequenced by using the reverse primer for polymerase chain reaction and the Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For the confirmation of the sequence results, cDNA from apoptotic Jurkat cells was subcloned into pBluescript II KS (Stratagene) and sequenced with M13 universal primers. To prevent disassembly of polysomes, cells (2 × 108) were cultured for 10 min in the presence of cycloheximide (5 μg/ml; Sigma) before harvesting (22.Sabatini D.D. Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Leinwand L.A. Cells: A Laboratory Manual. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1998: 37.1-37.22Google Scholar). Harvested cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed for 15 min on ice with 2.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.25m sucrose, 25 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 μg/ml cycloheximide, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g to collect the post-mitochondrial fraction (the supernatant). Ultracentrifuge tubes (No. 349622; Beckman Instrument Co.) were filled with 0.75 ml of a 2.0 m sucrose solution (with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 25 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and 0.63 ml of a 0.5 m sucrose solution. The post-mitochondrial supernatant (0.9 ml/tube) was added as the top zone, and the tubes were centrifuged for 3 h at 2 °C and 105,000 × g. Polysomes compose more than 90% of the resulting pellet (23.Wettstein F.O. Staehelin T. Noll H. Nature. 1963; 197: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Polysomes were harvested from the pellets by using 50 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1.6 unit/μl RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI). Cells were placed in serum-free RPMI 1640 lacking methionine (Sigma) and pulse-labeled with 110 μCi/ml l-[35S]methionine (EASYTAG; NEN Life Science Products) for 20 min. Cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed for 10 min on ice with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.15m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 × g. The supernatant was subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Autoradiograms were scanned by using an image analyzer (Model ES-8000; Epson, Tokyo, Japan), and the intensity of the bands was evaluated with the NIH Image software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). We selected two apoptosis systems: the human T-cell leukemia cell line Jurkat, treated with the anti-Fas antibody CH-11 to activate Fas (the Fas-Jurkat system), and the human monoblastic leukemia cell line U937, treated with TNF-α to activate TNFR1 (the TNFR-U937 system). These systems including leukemia-type cell lines seem reasonable because Fas and TNFR1 have been shown to be important in the development and function of leukocytes in mice lacking these receptors (3.Los M. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 629-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 24.Yeh W.C. Hakem R. Woo M. Mak T.W. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 169: 283-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To examine the alteration of rRNA in these apoptosis systems, total RNA was isolated by using Trizol and analyzed by polyacrylamide-agarose composite gel electrophoresis. Bands in addition to those of unmodified rRNA appeared in the apoptotic cells (Fig.1 A, lanes 1 and3). No alteration of RNA was detected in control samples (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2 and 4), and Jurkat cells treated with unrelated mouse IgM lacked any additional bands (Fig. 1 A, lane 6). The electrophoresis patterns shown here are much simpler than those during apoptosis induced by cAMP analogs (18.Houge G. Robaye B. Eikhom T.S. Golstein J. Mellgren G. Gjertsen B.T. Lanotte M. Doskeland S.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2051-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). No difference occurred in the banding patterns of apoptotic and control samples separated on 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to identify smaller RNA molecules (data not shown). Ribosomes are generated in the nucleoli and are exported from the nucleus as mature forms (25.Warner J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To examine whether the extra RNA molecules we identified occurred in cytoplasmic ribosomes, cytoplasmic polysome fractions from apoptotic Jurkat cells were collected by ultracentrifugation. RNAs collected from the fractions were analyzed by using composite gel electrophoresis. The extra bands were observed in the polysome fractions (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that the extra RNA molecules were derived from ribosomes involved in protein synthesis and were not due to aberrant RNA synthesis in apoptotic nuclei. Because the extra RNA species were not concentrated by polysome isolation (compare lanes 1 and 3, Fig. 1 B), this rRNA alteration was not specific to the polysome. Although these two systems stimulate different death receptors, the patterns of extra RNA were very similar (Fig. 1 A). In particular, both systems yielded a prominent band (indicated by the arrowhead in Fig.1 A) just smaller than 18 S rRNA; the similar mobility of this band from the two cell types suggests an identical structure. We then sought the molecular identity of this RNA species. After composite gel electrophoresis, RNA from apoptotic and control Jurkat cells were electroblotted onto nylon membranes, and the blots were hybridized with probes for 28 S and 18 S rRNA. This prominent band hybridized with the 28 S rRNA probe (Fig. 2 A,left panel), but no extra bands were detected with the probe for 18 S rRNA (Fig. 2 A, right panel). This finding suggests that this RNA species derived from RNase-degraded 28 S rRNA. To precisely map the cutting site, we performed Northern blotting analysis by using oligonucleotide probes for various partial sequences of 28 S rRNA. The prominent RNA band identified previously comprised the 3′-terminal region of 28 S rRNA (TableI), and the putative cleavage site presumably was somewhere between nucleotides 3251 and 3710. Next, this RNA fragment was isolated from Jurkat and U-937 cells undergoing apoptosis and assessed carefully by using 5′-RACE. The analysis of amplified cDNA fragments revealed a single band with identical mobility from both systems (Fig. 2 B). The diffuse nature of the bands mainly is due to the various lengths of the dC-tail of the template cDNAs. Sequencing of these cDNA samples revealed that in both systems, the 5′-end of the RNA molecule was nucleotide 3536; by definition (26.Gorski J.L. Gonzalez I.L. Schmickel R.D. J. Mol. Evol. 1987; 24: 236-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 27.Wakeman J.A. Maden E.H. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the cutting site maps to variable region eight (Fig. 2 C). This result suggests that although these systems stimulate different death receptors, the cutting mechanism may be very similar, possibly executed by the same RNase. This result further suggests that the extra RNA species indicated by theasterisks in Fig. 1 is the 5′-terminal region of 28 S rRNA (see also Fig. 2 A, middle panel).Table ISummary of hybridization with 28 S rRNA-derived probesProbe sequencePosition in human 28 S rRNAaStructure of human 28 S rRNA (5025 nucleotides) was determined by Gonzalez et al.

(21.Gonzalez I.L. Gorski J.L. Campen T.J. Dorney D.J. Erickson J.M. Sylvester J.E. Schmickel R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7666-7670Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab Probes were chemically synthesized and terminal-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Total RNA was isolated from Jurkat cells treated with anti-Fas antibody, electrophoresed in polyacrylamide-agarose composite gels, and subjected to Northern blotting with the labeled probes. Caspases are a family of proteases that are specifically activated by apoptotic stimuli (12.Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar). During the execution phase of apoptosis, effector caspases are activated, and the various substrates are digested to promote cell death. In particular, caspase-3 is a key player involved in degradation of many components in cells. If the execution phase leads to rRNA degradation, caspase-3 may be upstream of its degradation. To investigate this possibility, Jurkat cells were pretreated with a caspase-3 inhibitor, a cell-permeable form of Z-DEVD-FMK, then treated with the monoclonal anti-Fas antibody CH-11. RNA and DNA collected from the cells were analyzed. Z-DEVD-FMK inhibited the degradation of genomic DNA (DNA ladder formation), which is executed by caspase-3-activated CAD (Fig.3 A, lower panel). Interestingly, degradation of 28 S rRNA also was suppressed by the caspase-3 inhibitor (Fig. 3 A, upper panel), suggesting that caspase-3 or a caspase-3-like protease is involved in the degradation of 28 S rRNA in the Fas-Jurkat system. We next examined the involvement of caspase-3 in rRNA degradation in the TNFR-U937 system. In this system, the caspase-3 inhibitor had no effect on rRNA degradation (Fig. 3 B, upper panel). This result was not because the inhibitor failed to work in this cell line: Z-DEVD-FMK suppressed DNA ladder formation in U937 cells (Fig. 3 B, lower panel) just as it had in Jurkat cells. In light of the identical structure of the main RNA fragment, different pathways, caspase-3-dependent and -independent pathways, likely activate the same or very similar RNases in these systems; these pathways ultimately converge in the cleaving of 28 S rRNA. We then sought the role of rRNA degradation in apoptosis. Our hypothesis was that irreversible fragmentation of rRNA compromised the function of ribosomes, that is, protein synthesis. To confirm this hypothesis, the kinetics of 28 S rRNA fragmentation and protein synthesis were examined. In the Fas-Jurkat system, a prominent 28 S rRNA-derived fragment, which gradually intensified, reproducibly was detected beginning 4 h after the addition of the monoclonal anti-Fas antibody CH-11 (Fig.4 A). In the same system, protein synthesis began to decrease at the onset of rRNA fragmentation (Fig. 4 B). To examine whether this coincidence was observed in another apoptosis system caused by death receptor engagement, the kinetics analysis was performed in the TNFR-U937 system, in which RNA fragmentation began to be detected 2 h after receptor stimulation (Fig.5 A). This cell line seemed especially sensitive to the low serum environment, and this stress caused a moderate decrease in protein synthesis in the absence of apoptotic stimulation (Fig. 5 B, right panel). However, apoptosis caused a more dramatic shutdown of protein synthesis (Fig. 5 B, left panel). Again, fragmentation of rRNA was concomitant with protein synthesis inhibition. These results in the two different systems suggested that fragmentation of rRNA occurs during the early execution phase of apoptosis (fragmentation occurred just a few hours after stimulation). Furthermore, rRNA fragmentation seems to be involved in the apoptosis-associated inhibition of protein synthesis in the cell. The close transient relationship between rRNA degradation and inhibition of protein synthesis (Figs. 4 and 5) suggests that this degradation is involved in the inhibition. To test this possibility, the effect of the caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK on protein synthesis was examined in the two apoptosis systems. The caspase-3 inhibitor suppressed protein synthesis inhibition (Fig. 6 A) and rRNA degradation (Fig. 3 A) in Jurkat cells. In contrast, Z-DEVD-FMK failed to recover protein synthesis in U937 cells (Fig.6 B), in which rRNA degradation was caspase-3-independent (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, degradation of rRNA may be a physiologically important cellular signal mediator for the malfunction of the protein synthesis machinery in our apoptosis systems. Malfunction of the ribosome causes death of cells and organisms. Until now, various small chemicals that specifically attack the ribosome have widely been used as antibiotics (28.Porse B.T. Garrett R.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 423-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Furthermore some natural toxins are protein ribotoxins. For example, ricin and α-sarcin catalyze covalent modifications in adjacent nucleotides of 28 S rRNA, leading to malfunction of the ribosome in vitroand in vivo (29.Wool I.G. Gluck A. Endo Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 266-269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Colicin E3 specifically cleaves a single site in 16 S rRNA in the small subunit of the bacterial ribosome, resulting in inactivation of the ribosome and death of the host bacteria (30.Bowman C.M. Dahlberg J.E. Ikemura T. Konisky J. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 964-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Here we propose the existence of a new RNase that is cryptic in normal cells but is activated to cleave 28 S rRNA in the polysome during apoptosis triggered by either of two death receptors. The putative cleavage site was identical in the 28 S rRNAs from the Fas-Jurkat and TNFR-U937 systems (Fig. 2). According to phylogenic studies of rRNA, the cleavage site is in variable region eight, which is absent in bacteria. This finding contrasts with the observation that α-sarcin and ricin attack an α-sarcin/ricin loop in a constant region (Fig. 2 C) that is involved in the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA and in GTP hydrolysis (29.Wool I.G. Gluck A. Endo Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 266-269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The function of variable regions currently is unknown. Variable region eight is conserved in vertebrates and contains a unique double-loop structure (27.Wakeman J.A. Maden E.H. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The apoptosis-associated cleavage might induce a change in the higher order structure of the rRNA and ribosome. The three-dimensional structure of the yeast ribosome has been published recently (31.Verschoor A. Warner J.R. Srivastava S. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Future structural analysis of eukaryotic ribosomes will provide insight into the possible function(s) of this variable region. From the comparison of the band intensities of intact 28 S rRNA and the main RNA fragment (Fig. 1 B), most ribosomes in the polysomes seem to be intact. Even though destructive digestion occurs in some ribosomes, how can degradation of so few ribosomes cause the inhibition of protein synthesis at the cellular level? This paradox was reported more than 20 years ago in studies of protein ribotoxins. In intact cells treated with ribotoxins such as ricin (32.Fodstad O. Olsnes S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 74: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and colicin E3 (33.Senior B.W. Kwasniak J. Holland I.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 53: 205-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), protein synthesis stopped when only a fraction of the ribosomes was inactivated. Two mechanisms that are not mutually exclusive have been proposed. In the first, impaired ribosomes are a dominant negative factor in polysomes. In this situation, one or a few ribosomes with damaged rRNA occur per polysome, attach to the mRNA, and block further elongation of the peptide chains. This block especially seems to inhibit synthesis of housekeeping proteins, which are constitutively synthesized in large quantities and are important for cell viability. In the second proposed mechanism, cleavage of rRNA generates signals for the inhibition of protein synthesis. The ricin- and α-sarcin-induced modification of rRNA activates stress-activated protein kinase (34.Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.-H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L.Y. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, this pathway might be activated downstream of rRNA degradation in our systems. A link between the pathway of stress-activated protein kinase and inhibition of protein synthesis has been reported very recently (35.Iordanov M.S. Paranjape J.M. Zhou A. Wong J. Williams B.R.G. Meurs E.F. Silverman R.H. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Another candidate of the signaling molecules activated by rRNA degradation is a double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase. Activated by double-stranded RNA, RNA-activated protein kinase autophosphorylates, phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2, and eventually inhibits protein synthesis (36.Proud C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 241-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). RNA-activated protein kinase is a ribosome-binding protein that associates with the large subunit via the ribosomal protein L18 (37.Kumar K.U. Srivastava S.P. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1116-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). rRNA has a complex secondary structure involving many loops of double-stranded RNA (26.Gorski J.L. Gonzalez I.L. Schmickel R.D. J. Mol. Evol. 1987; 24: 236-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cleavage of 28 S rRNA might expose part of such a structure in a large subunit, thereby stimulating RNA-activated protein kinase. RNA-activated protein kinase is activated in U937 cells that have been treated with TNF-α (38.Yeung M.C. Liu J. Lau A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12451-12455Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Our culture cell systems may help to resolve the apparent paradox. Determining the structure of an RNA fragment (Table I and Fig. 2) provides a key piece of information needed to identify RNase responsible for cleaving 28 S rRNA. So what kind of RNase is involved in this cleavage? Explaining the selective cleavage of 28 S rRNA in light of current knowledge of RNases is impossible. The base on the nucleotide at the 3′ side of the phosphodiester bond preferentially broken by human pancreatic-type RNase is cytosine (39.Nadano D. Yasuda T. Sawazaki K. Takeshita H. Kishi K. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In human cells, 2–5A-dependent RNase L (40.Zhou A. Hassel B.A. Silverman R.H. Cell. 1993; 72: 753-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), which is downstream of interferon receptors and also implicated in apoptosis (41.Zhou A. Paranjape J. Brown T.L. Nie H. Naik S. Dong B. Chang A. Trapp B. Fairchild R. Colmenares C. Silverman R.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6355-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), cleaves 28 S rRNA at different sites, between nucleotides 3999 and 4000 and between 4000 and 4001 (35.Iordanov M.S. Paranjape J.M. Zhou A. Wong J. Williams B.R.G. Meurs E.F. Silverman R.H. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), suggesting that the RNase in our study could be a different one. Some mammalian RNases have cytotoxicity dependent on their RNase activity (42.D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1997Google Scholar). However, their targets are largely unknown. CAD is a well characterized nuclease that is activated during apoptosis (11.Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2807) Google Scholar). Fragmentation of rRNA occurred even when CAD activation was suppressed (Fig. 3 B), indicating that CAD is not essential for rRNA degradation in the TNFR-U937 system. Although a previous report described the correlation between rRNA fragmentation and genomic DNA fragmentation during apoptosis (18.Houge G. Robaye B. Eikhom T.S. Golstein J. Mellgren G. Gjertsen B.T. Lanotte M. Doskeland S.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2051-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), our data suggest the presence of a nuclease other than one involved in the digestion of genomic DNA. The functional relationship between protein synthesis and apoptosis remains enigmatic. In some systems, inhibitors of protein synthesis prevent apoptosis in the cell; in others, these inhibitors promote cell death (13.Wertz I.E. Hanley M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 359-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Apoptosis caused by engagement of death receptors is an example of a system in which inhibition of protein synthesis promotes cell death (1.Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5154) Google Scholar). The connection between rRNA fragmentation and inhibition of protein synthesis (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6) suggests that this fragmentation is a promotive effector for the execution of cell death. Identification of the molecules responsible for this degradation likely will reveal new execution pathways of apoptosis. In addition, this identification will be noteworthy in the field of signal transduction because no intracellular RNase except 2–5A-dependent RNase L has been shown to be involved in signaling initiated from extracellular stimuli.

Transfection experiments showed that interleukin-1β stimulates the phospholipase A2 [−1614; +20] promoter activity by 6–7-fold and that the [−210; −176] fragment is critical for this stimulation. CAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) β and C/EBPδ transcription factors bind to this element as shown by bandshift experiments. Interleukin-1β increased the levels of C/EBPδ mRNA as soon as 2 h and up to 24 h whithout affecting those of C/EBPβ. Higher amounts of C/EBPδ proteins correlate with the stimulation of C/EBPδ mRNA. Mutations or 5′ deletions in the upstream [−247; −210] region reduced by 2-fold the basal and interleukin-1β-stimulated transcription activities. Two types of factors bind to overlapping sequences on this fragment: NF1-like proteins and the glucocorticoid receptor. The glucocorticoid receptor is responsible for a moderate stimulation of the promoter activity by dexamethasone and may interact with C/EBP factors to achieve a full transcription activity in basal conditions and in the presence of interleukin-1β. A [−114; −85] proximal regulatory element forms three complexes in bandshift experiments, the slowest mobility one involving the Sp1 zinc finger factor. Mutation of this sequence reduced to 2-fold the stimulation of the promoter activity by interleukin-1β or the C/EBP factors. Induction of the transcription of secreted type IIA phospholipase A2 gene by interleukin-1β in chondrocytes absolutely requires C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ factors but does not involve NF-κB.

Such quantities inhibit collagen synthesis and therefore contribute to joint destruction. These inflammatory lipid mediators are produced by a cascade of enzymes among which phospholipases A2(PLA2)1 play a key role by releasing arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids. Two calcium-dependent PLA2 are involved in the release of arachidonic acid. Cytosolic PLA2, a ubiquitous 85-kDa enzyme, is activated by MAP kinases and translocated from the cytosol to membrane (1Clark J.D. Lin L.L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N.

Chem. 1993; 268: 1960-1964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Type IIA secreted PLA2(sPLA2-IIA) was originally purified from the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, which contains high quantities of this enzyme (3Seilhamer J.J. Pruzanski W. Vadas P. Plant S. Miller J.A. Kloss J. Johnson L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5335-5338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). sPLA2-IIA belongs to a large group of 13–15-kDa secreted enzymes present in mammalian fluids and in the venoms of snakes and insects. According to a recent classification (4Dennis E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), the pancreatic version of the enzyme has been included in a type I group whereas the synovial PLA2 is referred as type IIA sPLA2. Three other recently cloned mammalian PLA2 were classified in IIC, V, and X groups, but their involvement in the arachidonic acid release remains unknown. Purified or recombinant sPLA2-IIA triggers joint inflammation when it is injected intra-articularly in rabbits (5Bomalaski J.S. Lawton P. Browning J.L. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3904-3910PubMed Google Scholar). The number of rheumatoid arthritis-affected joints and the presence of destructive erosion have been correlated with the amount of sPLA2-type IIA in the serum of patients (6Lin M.K. Farewell V. Vadas P. Bookman A.A. Keystone E.C. Pruzanski W. J. Rheumatol. 1996; 23: 1162-1166PubMed Google Scholar). Mice with both the TNFα and sPLA2-IIA transgenes exhibit more joint destruction than do those with TNFα alone (7Winkler J. Marshall L. Kargel P.S.B. Nevalainen T.J. Büchler M.W. Phospholipase A2, Basic and Clinical Aspects in Inflammatory Diseases. Basal, Switzerland1997Google Scholar). Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is the most abundant cytokine in inflammatory synovial fluids. It stimulates the expression of numerous genes in articular cells (8Margerie D. Flechtenmacher J. Buttner F.H. Karbowski A. Puhl W. Schleyerbach R. Bartnik E. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1997; 5: 129-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and increases the level of sPLA2-IIA mRNA in chondrocytes. We have previously demonstrated that prostaglandin E2 production by rabbit articular chondrocytes is related to plasma membrane-associated sPLA2-IIA activity and that the transcription rate of sPLA2-IIA gene is stimulated by IL-1β (9Jacques C.

Res. 1996; 222: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Three main classes of transcriptional factors have been shown to mediate the effect of IL-1β on gene transcription: (i) NF-κB is a dimer of p50 and p65 subunits and belongs to the Rel family. (ii) A member of the STAT family of transcription factors, which are activated through phosphorylation by Jak kinases and translocated to the cell nucleus within a few minutes, was characterized as an IL-1β-stimulated factor but can also be activated by IL-6 and lipopolysaccharide (12Tsukada J. Waterman W.R. Koyama Y. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2183-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). (iii) AP-1 can also be involved in the IL-1β pathway because IL-1β induces the transcription of the c-Jun and c-Fos genes in some cell models (13Yokoo T. Kitamura M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F-123-FF130Google Scholar). C/EBP transcription factors are involved in the regulation of gene transcription by IL-6. The C/EBP family includes three main members: C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EPBδ. This last member is transcriptionally induced by IL-6 (14Alam T. An M.R. Papaconstantinou J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5021-5024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Baumann H. Morella K.K. Campos S.P. Cao Z. Jahreis G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19744-19751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas C/EBPβ is mainly regulated at the post-transcriptional level by this cytokine in hepatoma cell lines (16Poli V. Mancini F.P. Cortese R. Cell. 1990; 63: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar,17Ramji D.P. Hughes T.R. Sabatakos G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 338SCrossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), although a transcriptional regulation of C/EBPβ by the inflammatory cytokines has also been described (for review see Ref.18Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). In contrast to IL-6, the relationship between IL-1β and C/EBP factors has been poorly studied, and some positive regulations in interaction with NF-κB have been reported (19Lee S.J. Hou J. Benveniste E.N. J. Neuroimmunol. 1998; 92: 196-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Jones P.L. Ping D. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6970-6981Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, induction of C/EBP binding to DNA by pro-inflammatory cytokines correlates with the accumulation of prostaglandin E2, and both effects are reversed by anti-inflammatory cytokines (21Alaaeddine N. Di Battista J.A. Pelletier J.P. Kiansa K. Cloutier J.M. Martel-Pelletier J. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). C/EBP factors act with NF-κB to induce the transcription of many acute phase response genes in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, and this effect is based on direct protein-protein interactions (22Stein B. Cogswell P.C. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3964-3974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Diehl J.A. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6635-6646Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Similar interactions have also been reported between C/EBP proteins and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which may explain the co-induction of the transcription of acute phase response genes by glucocorticoids and cytokines (24Ingrassia R. Savoldi G.F. Caraffini A. Tironi M. Poiesi C. Williams P. Albertini A. Di Lorenzo D. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 615-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The GR is a member of the steroid/nuclear receptor superfamily and binds to the glucocorticoid-responsive element (GRE) on gene promoters (25Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6085) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the activity of the sPLA2-IIA promoter is controlled by three regulatory elements in human hepatoma HepG2 cells (26Olivier J.L. Fan Q. Salvat C. Ziari M. Kong L. Mangeney M. Bereziat G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7134-7145Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 A). The [−210; −176] element C is critical for the stimulation of the promoter by IL-6 and binds C/EBP family members, whereas an adjacent [−247; −210] element D is recognized by several factors, some of which belonging to the NF1 family (27Fan Q. Paradon M. Salvat C. Bereziat G. Olivier J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4238-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The [−114; −85] element B is responsible for a high basal activity when the region upstream of the C/EBP-binding site is deleted (28Paradon M. Salvat C. Fan Q. Bereziat G. Olivier J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that C/EBP factors can mediate the stimulation of transcription by IL-6 in HepG2 cells by suppressing the basal inhibition of transcription, a process that may involve single strand binding activities (27Fan Q. Paradon M. Salvat C. Bereziat G. Olivier J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4238-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this study, we have identified the sequences and transcription factors involved in the stimulation of the sPLA2-IIA promoter by IL-1β in chondrocytes. We have found that C/EBPδ plays a critical role in this stimulation and is transcriptionally induced by IL-1β in chondrocytes. We have also shown that the glucocorticoid receptor and the NF1/CTF family members bind to overlapping sites in the previously identified regulatory D element. Moreover Sp1 and other unknown factors bind to the regulatory elements B. These last factors and the glucocorticoid receptor potentiate the transactivation of the sPLA2-IIA promoter by C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ to achieve full stimulation by IL-1β. Restriction enzymes, T4 kinase, ligase, and Taq polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs. Oligonucleotides were provided by Oligoexpress (Paris, France). Materials for cell culture and protein molecular weight markers were provided from Sigma (Dulbecco's supplemented modified Eagle medium, Ham's F-12 medium, fetal calf serum, HEPES, trypsin), Life Technologies, Inc. (Gey medium) and Costar (town, state) (flasks and Petri dishes). The β-galactosidase expression vector CMV-β-gal was obtained from CLONTECH, and poly(dI-dC) and deoxynucleotides were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Radioactive products were supplied by ICN or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Collagenase, hyaluronidase, and trypsin for the preparation of monolayers of rabbit chondrocytes were supplied by Roche Molecular Biochemicals. IL-1β was provided by Immungenex (Los Angeles, CA). The various CAT constructs containing wild type and mutant fragments of the sPLA2-IIA promoter have been described elsewhere (26Olivier J.L. Fan Q. Salvat C. Ziari M. Kong L. Mangeney M. Bereziat G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7134-7145Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Fan Q. Paradon M. Salvat C. Bereziat G. Olivier J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4238-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). PHD expression vectors containing C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ were a gift from Dr. Ciliberto (Rome, Italy). Three-week-old female Fauve de Bourgogne rabbits were killed and the shoulders, knees, and femoral heads were dissected out under sterile conditions as described by Jacques et al. (9Jacques C. Bereziat G. Humbert L. Olivier J.L. Corvol M.T. Masliah J. Berenbaum F. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1864-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The articular cartilage was removed, cut into small pieces, and digested at 37 °C with 0.05% hyaluronidase in Gey medium for 15 min and then with 0.25% trypsin for 30 min and finally with 0.2% collagenase for 90 min. The chondrocytes were then washed with Ham's F-12 medium for 60 min. The suspension of chondrocytes was seeded into 60 mm dishes (1.5 × 105 cells per dish) in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2, and the culture medium was changed every 2–3 sday. The cells reached preconfluency within 6–7 days. Chondrocytes were transfected using the calcium phosphate DNA co-precipitation method. Cells were changed by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium before transfection. Cells were incubated with the transfection mixture containing 12 μg of pUC-SH-CAT constructs and 2.5 μg of plasmids bearing the β-galactosidase gene for 4 h and then shocked with HBS buffer (21 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, 16 mm dextrose, 0.8 mm NA2HPO4, 5 mm KCl, and 137 mm NaCl) containing 15% glycerol for 90 s. The cells were incubated 20 h in Ham's F-12 supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin and grown for an additional 24 h in the presence or absence of IL-1β (10 ng/ml). The harvested cells were lysed by incubation with 50 μl of 100 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 0.7% Nonidet P-40 for 15 min at 4 °C. CAT activities were measured by the two-liquid phases method as described by Fan et al. (27Fan Q. Paradon M. Salvat C. Bereziat G. Olivier J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4238-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activities were measured to normalize variations in transfection efficiency. Transfection experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated four times with two different preparations of plasmids. Chondrocytes nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (27Fan Q. Paradon M. Salvat C. Bereziat G. Olivier J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4238-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cells from 3 P100 dishes were grown in Ham's F-12 without fetal calf serum and then incubated in the presence or absence of IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for 24 h in Ham's F-12 containing 10% fetal calf serum. They were then washed and scraped off into phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was suspended in 500 μl of buffer A (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mmNaF). The cells were incubated at 4 °C for 15 min, centrifuged at 6000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was suspended in 100 μl of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mm NaF). The nuclei were lysed by pipetting up and down four times and incubating for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a TLC centrifuge (Beckman). The supernatants were collected, and the protein concentrations were measured according Olivier et al. (26Olivier J.L. Fan Q. Salvat C. Ziari M. Kong L. Mangeney M. Bereziat G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7134-7145Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The nuclear protein batches were stored at −80 °C. Lysates of COS-1 cells were prepared 40 h after transfection of the cells with the C/EBP expression vectors according to Olivier et al. (26Olivier J.L. Fan Q. Salvat C. Ziari M. Kong L. Mangeney M. Bereziat G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7134-7145Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We used the double-stranded CWT and DWT as wild type probes, corresponding to the [−210; −176] sequence of the element C and to the [−247; −210] sequence of the element D. These double-stranded oligonucleotides (100 ng) were labeled using T4 kinase and 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Free nucleotides were separated from the labeled probe on a Sephadex G50 column. The specific activity of the probe was estimated by spotting 1 μl of the labeling mixture (before the G50 column) on to a TLC plate, separating the labeled probe and free nucleotide by chromatography, and counting them. The specific activities were 1–2 108 cpm/μg. Chondrocyte nuclear extracts (6–9 μg) were incubated at 4 °C for 15 min in 20 ml of solution containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 8% Ficoll, 40 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 3 μg of double-stranded poly(dI-dC). When double-stranded competitor oligonucleotides were used, they were added in a volume of 1 μl, and the reaction mixture was incubated with the nuclear extracts at 4 °C for 15 min before adding the probe. As competitors in bandshift assays, we used the Sp1 oligonucleotide 5′-GCAGTGTTTCTCCGCCCCGATACGCGTAT-3′ (29Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar), the consensus glucocorticoid responsive element 5′-AGCTGCTCAGCTGGTACACTCCGTCCTCTACT (30Massaad C. Lombes M. Aggerbeck M. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Barouki R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the HNF3 oligonucleotide 5′-GTTGACTAAGTCAATAATCAGA-3′ corresponding to the HNF3-binding element of the transthyretin promoter (31Costa R.H. Grayson D.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1415-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), the NF1 oligonucleotide 5′-ACAATTTTTTGGCAAGAATATTAT-3′ and the C/EBP oligonucleotide 5′-TGGTATGATTTTGTAATGGGGTAGGA-3′, which correspond to the elements E and D, respectively, of the murine albumin promoter (32Maire P. Wuarin J. Schibler U. Science. 1989; 244: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The sequences of the other oligonucleotides used as competitors are indicated on the corresponding figures. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes (60,000 cpm) were then added, and the incubation was continued for 30 min at 4 °C. Free DNA and DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis in 5% or 7% polyacrylamide gels in 6.7 mm Tris-HCl, 3.3 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.9. The gels were dried and used to expose X-OMAT® films (Eastman Kodak Co.). In supershift experiments, chondrocyte nuclear extracts were preincubated for 15 min at 4 °C with 1 μl of antibodies raised against Sp1, C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, or C/EBPδ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Total RNA was isolated from cultured chondrocytes using guanidinium isothiocyanate. The total RNA content was measured by spectrophotometry, and its integrity was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis; 15 μg of total RNA/lane were separated on 1% agarose/2.2 m formaldehyde gels and transferred to nylon filters (Hybond N; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were prehybridized for 15 min, and then hybridized at 65 °C for 2 h with the various probes in the rapid hyb-buffer medium (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The specific C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ probes were obtained by digestion of the corresponding expression vectors with PstI and XhoI (New England Biolabs, Boston, MA) respectively. The digestion products were separated on 1% agarose gels, the 500- and 850-bp-length bands corresponding to fragments of the C/EBPδ and C/EBPβ cDNA, respectively, were sliced and extracted using the Gene-Clean kit (Bio101, La Jolla, CA). The C/EBP probes were labeled using the random-primed labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol). An oligonucleotide hybridizing to the 28 S RNA was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 kinase and used as probe to take into account the variations in loaded and transferred RNA. The hybridized filters were washed twice in 2× SSC (150 mmNaCl, 17 mm trisodium citrate) 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min and then twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at room temperature and at 50 °C. Autoradiography was performed for 10 days for C/EBP probes and 24 h for the 28 S RNA probe. The blots were successively hybridized with the C/EBPδ, C/EBPβ, and 28 S RNA probes. The filters were washed in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 85 °C for 10 min before rehybridization. Aliquots (50 μg) of nuclear proteins were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.38m Tris-HCl, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.8, and electroblotted on to Protran BA83 nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schull). The membranes were saturated in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% nonfat milk at 4 °C overnight, hybridized with anti-C/EBPβ or anti-C/EBPδ antibodies (Santa Cruz) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed in the saturation buffer, and then developed using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The abundance of C/EBPδ protein in nuclear extracts from untreated and IL-1β-treated chondrocytes was calculated by quantitative scanning of autoradiograms using a CCD video camera and the Densylab system (Quantum Bioprobe, Montreuil, France). Rabbit primary culture chondrocytes were transfected with CAT constructs containing various 5′ deleted fragments of the sPLA2-IIA promoter. A 24-h treatment of the cells by IL-1β increased by 6.6 ± 2 the activity of the [−1614; +20] fragment of the sPLA2-IIA promoter (Fig.1 B). Deletion of the [−247; −225] fragment decreased by 2-fold the basal and IL-1β-stimulated transcription activities. The relative stimulation of the transcription activities by IL-1β was not significantly modified by the 5′ deletions from the −225 to the −203 positions because the basal and stimulated activities were similarly decreased. Deletion downstream from the position −195 completely suppressed the stimulation of the transcription activity by IL-1β. Deletion of the −159/−138 fragment produced an additional 2-fold reduction of the transcription activity, and the promoter activity was suppressed by a further deletion to the −87 position (Fig. 1 B). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that chondrocyte nuclear extracts formed two complexes, C1 and C2, with the CWT probe, which corresponds to the [−210; −176] (Fig.2 B, lanes 1 and 7). The slowest electrophoretic mobility complex C1 could be clearly observed only when the chondrocytes were treated with IL-1β prior the extraction of the nuclear proteins (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 1 and 7). The C2 complex was formed when the extracts of both the untreated and IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes were used, but its intensity was higher when the cells were treated by IL-1β (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 1and 7). Because this region was previously shown to correspond to a C/EBP-binding site in hepatocytes (26Olivier J.L. Fan Q. Salvat C. Ziari M. Kong L. Mangeney M. Bereziat G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7134-7145Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we used as competitors the C/EBP-binding oligonucleotide corresponding to the D element of the murine albumin promoter (32Maire P. Wuarin J. Schibler U. Science. 1989; 244: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and the Cmut oligonucleotide in which the −199/−197 5′-TTT-3′ triplet was mutated into an 5′-GCC-3′ sequence (Fig. 2 A). All the complexes were suppressed when the chondrocyte nuclear extracts were preincubated with the C/EBP-binding oligonucleotide prior to the addition of the CWT probe (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2 and 8). By contrast, none of the complexes were competed out by the Cmut oligonucleotide (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and 9). An antibody raised against C/EBPα did not alter any of the complexes formed between the CWT probe and the chondrocyte nuclear extracts (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4 and 10). Because all the C/EBP family members share the same binding site, it is likely that rabbit articular chondrocytes lack C/EBPα expression. Antibodies to C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ supershifted the C1 complex (Fig.2 B, lanes 5, 6, 11, and 12). The upper part of the C2 complex was displaced by the antibody to C/EBPβ complex (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5and 11), whereas its lower part was shifted by the antibody to C/EBPδ (Fig. 2 B, lanes 6 and 12). Because C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ bind to DNA by forming heterodimers as well as homodimers, these data indicate that the C1 complex is formed by C/EBPβ-C/EBPδ heterodimers, whereas the C2 complex is heterogeneous and corresponds to co-migrating C/EBPβ-C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ-C/EBPδ homodimers. The mutations of the whole [−204; −181] sequence or the −199/−197 triplet abolished the stimulation of the promoter activity by IL-1β (Fig. 3). The 6-fold stimulation of the wild type [−326; +20] sPLA2-IIA promoter activity by IL-1β was mimicked by co-transfecting the C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ expression vectors with the [−326; +20]-pUC-SH-CAT construct in the absence of cytokine treatment (Fig. 3). By contrast co-transfection had no effect with the mutated CAT constructs for the element C. Treatment of the cells with IL-1β, after co-transfection of the C/EBP expression vectors with the wild type [−326; +20]-pUC-SH-CAT construct, did not increase the stimulation of the [−326; +20] promoter activity by the overexpressed C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ factors (Fig. 3), suggesting a pivotal role for the C/EBP factors in the induction of the sPLA2-IIA promoter activity by IL-1β. Messenger RNA levels of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ were measured in chondrocytes at various times after treatment by IL-1β. The C/EBPδ mRNAs were barely detectable by Northern blot in absence of IL-1β. The C/EBPδ mRNA levels were increased by IL-1β after a 2-h treatment, reached maximal values between 14–16 h of treatment, and were maintained over a 24-h period. By contrast IL-1β did not affect the levels of C/EBPβ mRNAs (Fig.4). Western blot experiments confirmed that IL-1β increased by 3–4-fold the concentration of C/EBPδ proteins (Fig. 5).Figure 5IL-1β increases the quantities of C/EBP δ protein in primary culture chondrocyte. A, confluent rabbit primary culture chondrocytes in P100 dishes were incubated with 10 ng/ml IL-1β or the carrier (phosphate saline buffer) for 24 h. 50 μg of nuclear proteins were separated by electrophoresis and transferred on to a nitrocellulose membrane as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” The membrane was incubated with antibodies raised against C/EBPδ. A lysate (5 μg proteins) of COS-I cells expressing C/EBPδ was used as a control of migration and hybridization.NS indicates a nonspecific band cross-hybridizing with the antibodies against C/EBPδ. The intensity of this band was measured and taken as reference. MW, molecular mass.

Transmitochondrial cell lines harboring 0, 97, and 100% of the 9480del15 deletion were created by fusing human cells lacking mtDNA (ρ0 cells) with platelet and lymphocyte fractions isolated from the patient. The COX III gene mutation resulted in a severe respiratory chain defect in all mutant cell lines. Cells homoplasmic for the mutation had no detectable COX activity or respiratory ATP synthesis, and required uridine and pyruvate supplementation for growth, a phenotype similar to ρ0cells. The cells with 97% mutated mtDNA exhibited severe reductions in both COX activity (6% of wild-type levels) and rates of ATP synthesis (9% of wild-type). The COX III polypeptide in the mutant cells, although translated at rates similar to wild-type, had reduced stability. There was no evidence for assembly of COX I, COX II, or COX III subunits in a multisubunit complex in cells homoplasmic for the mutation, thus indicating that there was no stable assembly of COX I with COX II in the absence of wild-type COX III.

The human enzyme is composed of 13 subunits. The three largest are encoded by mtDNA (COX I, COX II, and COX III) and the remainder by the nuclear DNA. The enzyme complex contains four redox-active metal centers, two coppers, CuAand CuB, and two hemes, a and a3 (1.Capaldi R.A. Annu. Rev.

Struct. 1998; 27: 329-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Three of these are located in COX I including the bimetallic heme a3-CuB center which is responsible for the reduction of oxygen to water coupled to the pumping of protons across the membrane (3.Iwata S.

Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). The polar domain of COX II contains the CuA metal center and serves as the cytochrome cdocking site. Together, mtDNA-encoded COX I and COX II form the catalytic core of the enzyme (3.Iwata S. Ostermier C. Ludwig B. Michel H.

The function of COX III, the only mtDNA-encoded COX subunit without prosthetic groups, is unknown but it is hypothesized to play a structural or regulatory role (5.Brunori M. Antonini G. Malatesta F.

A V-shaped cleft formed by the interface of COX III and COX I is one of several channels for oxygen proposed from the structures of COX (3.Iwata S. Ostermier C. Ludwig B. Michel H.

The functional significance of the other nuclear-encoded COX subunits is unclear, but they are hypothesized to play structural or regulatory roles (1.Capaldi R.A. Annu. Rev.

COX deficiencies comprise a heterogeneous group of disorders that present a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes of variable severity. COX deficiency has been documented in disorders caused by mutations in mtDNA-encoded tRNA genes, such as mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS; tRNALeu(UUR)) and mtDNA disorders caused by large deletions of mtDNA such as Kearns-Sayre syndrome. Usually these disorders present with multiple respiratory chain enzyme deficiencies including COX deficiency (11.Holt I.J. Harding A.E. Cooper J.M. Schapira A.H. Toscano A. Clark J.B.

The Lancet. 1991; 338: 143-147Abstract PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Several types of isolated COX deficiency have been described including Leigh disease and a fatal infantile form presenting as a myopathy or cardiomyopathy (14.DiMauro S. Lombes A. Hirofumi N. Mita S. Fabrizi G.M. Tritschler H. Bonilla E. Miranda A.F. DeVivo D.C. Schon E.A. Pediatr. Res. 1990; 28: 536-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 15.Robinson B.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1182: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The first documented COX gene mutation (encoded by mtDNA or nuclear DNA) associated with COX deficiency was a 15-bp deletion (9480del15) in the mtDNA-encoded COX III gene (16.Keightley J.A. Hoffbuhr K.C. Burton M.D. Salas M.S. Johnston W.S.W. Penn A.M.W. Buist N.R.M. Kennaway N.G. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This in-frame deletion removed 5 amino acids (92delPhe-Phe-Phe-Ala-Gly) from a conserved transmembrane region of the COX III polypeptide, one of two regions that contact COX I in the holoenzyme (4.Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). The patient had high levels of mutation in skeletal muscle (92%) and low levels (<1%) in leukocytes. Analysis of single muscle fibers revealed a correlation between levels of mutation and COX activity in muscle fibers, with COX negative fibers having a higher level of mutation (98.6 ± 0.8%) than COX positive fibers (25 ± 25%). Western analyses revealed a reduction in the steady state levels of COX subunits II, IV, Va, Vb, and VIc, indicating that assembly or stability of the holoenzyme was compromised by the 5-amino acid deletion in COX III. To investigate the consequences of the 9480del15 for COX assembly and enzymatic function, the mutation was transferred to a human cell line devoid of mtDNA (ρ0 cell line) developed by King and Attardi (17.King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). This cell system allows the study of mtDNA mutations without the contribution of the patient's nuclear background and has been used successfully to investigate mutations in mitochondrial tRNA (18.Chomyn A.

The medium for cell line 143B206 and transmitochondrial cell lines 51.112.50 and 51.112.28 also was supplemented with 50 μg of uridine/ml. Myoblast cultures were established from a needle biopsy of the patient, as described previously (24.Miranda A.F. Peterson E.R. Muasurovsky E.B. Tissue & Cell. 1988; 20: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and grown in DMEM supplemented with 50 μg of uridine/ml and 15% FBS. Transformation of the 143B206 cell line with mitochondria from cultured myoblasts was performed by cytoplast fusion of enucleated myoblasts (25.King M.P. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 313-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cybrids were plated in selective medium (DMEM supplemented with 100 μg of 5-bromodeoxyuridine/ml and 5% dialyzed FBS) 24 h after fusion and were grown for approximately 2–3 weeks. Single colonies were isolated with glass cloning cylinders, and cells were subsequently cultured in DMEM containing 5% FBS. For platelet-leukocyte mediated transformation of 143B206 cells, a platelet-enriched fraction and a leukocyte fraction were isolated from 20 ml of whole blood by differential centrifugation (26.Chomyn A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 334-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The platelet and leukocyte fractions were mixed, washed with DMEM, and pelleted by centrifugation. The cell pellet was mixed with 1.5 × 106 143B206 ρ0 cells and membrane fusion was promoted by the addition of polyethylene glycol. Cybrids were plated in selective medium 24 h after fusion. Mass cultures were isolated after 2 weeks of growth in selective medium and were replated at low density, in non-selective medium (DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and 50 μg of uridine/ml) for isolation of cell clones. Ethidium bromide was used to manipulate the mtDNA content in two cell lines, 51.129 and 51.112 (27.King M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 339-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exponentially growing cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS, 50 ng of ethidium bromide/ml and 50 μg of uridine/ml for 14 days. After treatment, cells were replated in non-selective medium and grown for 3 days, then replated at low density in either the same medium or DMEM supplemented with 5% dialyzed FBS to isolate individual clones for analysis. Total DNA was isolated from exponentially growing cells (28.Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1986: 47-50Crossref Google Scholar). PCR analysis of mutation levels was performed as described previously (16.Keightley J.A. Hoffbuhr K.C. Burton M.D. Salas M.S. Johnston W.S.W. Penn A.M.W. Buist N.R.M. Kennaway N.G. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Amplified DNA fragments of the wild-type (85 bp) or the mutated mtDNA (70 bp) were differentiated by size after electrophoresis through 10% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried and quantitated by PhosphorImaging using Molecular Analyst software (Molecular Imager, Bio-Rad). Values were corrected for the number of α-32P-labeled nucleotides that would be incorporated into the wild-type (39 dATP) or the mutated (30 dATP) PCR fragments. Dot blots to quantitate mtDNA were performed as described (17.King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). Four or five aliquots of 5 × 104 cells were isolated from each cell line including 143B and 143B206. Cell samples were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.5m NaOH. 50 μl of each sample was subsequently blotted on Zeta Probe membrane (Bio-Rad) in duplicate. A strand-specific probe corresponding to nt 2441–2954 of mtDNA-encoded 16 S rRNA gene was obtained by extension of the M13 universal primer on single stranded template isolated from the M13 clone mp18.XS6.2 (29.King M.P. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10228-10237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as described previously (30.Sucov H.M. Benson S. Robinson J.J. Britten R.J. Wilt F. Davidson E.H. Dev. Biol. 1987; 120: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized according to manufacturer's directions. Hybridization signals were visualized and quantitated with Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Oxygen consumption was measured as described previously (20.King M.P. Koga Y. Davidson M. Schon E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), utilizing 5 × 106 cells resuspended in 1.65 ml of DMEM lacking glucose. For mitochondrial enzyme assays, mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation (31.Chomyn A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 197-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from four or five 15-cm dishes of exponentially growing cells and resuspended in 200 μl of 0.25 msucrose, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 150 μmMgCl2. Total mitochondrial protein concentrations were determined by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). COX activity of isolated mitochondria was measured as previously (32.Wharton D.C. Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 245-250Crossref Scopus (1328) Google Scholar), except that the oxidation of cytochrome c was performed at 30 °C using 0.1% laurylmaltoside in the assay buffer. Citrate synthase activity was measured at 30 °C after resuspending mitochondria in 0.5% Triton X-100 (33.Shepherd D. Garland P.B. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 11-12Crossref Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Complex III activity was assayed as described (34.Birch-Machin M.A. Shepherd I.M. Watmough N.J. Sherratt H.S.A. Bartlett K. Darley-Usmar V.M. Milligan D.W.A. Welch R.A. Aynsley-Green A. Turnbull D.M. Pediatr.

Mitochondria were prepared as described previously (35.Millis A.J.T. Pious D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 292: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) after scraping monolayer cultures from five 15-cm culture dishes (approximately 3 × 107 cells) into 30 ml of 0.27 m mannitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3. After a brief treatment with protease XIV (Sigma), cells were disrupted with four strokes in a Teflon-glass homogenizer and the mitochondrial fraction was isolated by differential centrifugation. The ability of isolated mitochondria to synthesize ATP by oxidative phosphorylation was assayed using succinate as a substrate. ATP synthesis was measured indirectly by the incorporation of32P into glucose 6-phosphate, following phosphorylation of ADP by inorganic phosphate in the presence of the myokinase inhibitor adenosine pentaphosphate (36.Tuena de Gomez-Puyou M. Ayala G. Darszon A. Gomez-Puyou A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9472-9478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Freshly isolated mitochondria (100–200 μg of protein) were incubated in 0.3 ml of 30 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmphosphate, 0.5 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate (8,500–9,120 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products Inc.), 6 mm succinate, 20 mm glucose, 20 units of hexokinase, 1 mmADP, and 50 μm adenosine pentaphosphate in a shaking water bath at 30 °C. Control reactions included 5 μg of the F0 inhibitor oligomycin. The reaction was terminated after 35 min by adding 30% trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10%. The reaction mixture was then centrifuged, and a 0.3-ml aliquot was removed, to which was sequentially added 1 ml of H2O, 1 ml of 3.3% ammonium molybdate in 3.75 nH2SO4, and 200 μl of acetone. Unincorporated phosphate was removed by extracting 6 times with 1 ml of benzene:isobutanol mixture (50:50, v/v, H2O saturated), after vortexing vigorously for 45 s each time. The amount of radioactivity present in an aliquot of the extracted reaction mixture, determined by scintillation counting, was taken to represent incorporation of radioactive phosphate. Total RNA was isolated from approximately 1.5 × 107 exponentially growing cells using the commercial RNA isolation reagent, RNAzol B (Tel-test Inc.). RNA was resuspended in formazol (Tel-test Inc.), and quantitated by UV absorbance. Total RNA (10–15 μg) was electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel containing 0.66 m formaldehyde (37.Fourney R.M. Miyakoshi J. Day R.S. Paterson M.C. Focus. 1988; 10: 5-7Google Scholar), transferred to Zeta Probe (Bio-Rad), and hybridized according to the manufacturer's directions. The following probes were labeled by random priming (38.Feinberg A. Vogelstein B. Anal.

RNA hybridization signals were quantitated with a Bio-Rad PhosphorImager (Molecular Imager) and visualized by autoradiography. Equal amounts of total mitochondrial protein were separated by electrophoresis through Tricine-SDS 10% polyacrylamide gels (40.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting, following standard protocols (41.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc.

Blots were incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of the appropriate primary antibody in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline and 0.3% Tween. The bound primary antibody was visualized by chemiluminescent detection (CDP Star Kit, Tropix). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against subunits I, II, and IV of COX were generously provided by R. Capaldi, University of Oregon. For pulse labelings, 6–10 10-cm dishes of exponentially growing cells were incubated for 60–120 min in methionine-free DMEM containing 250–500 μCi of [35S]methionine (>1,000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products Inc.), 5% dialyzed FBS, and 100 μg of emetine/ml (31.Chomyn A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 197-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A modified labeling protocol was used for the short pulse labelings. Cells were labeled for 15 min, 1 h, or 2 h. Immediately after labeling, dishes were washed with ice-cold DMEM containing 2 mm unlabeled methionine, 100 μg of emetine/ml, and five protease inhibitors: 174 μg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/ml, 10 μg of leupeptin/ml, 3.4 μg of pepstatin A/ml, 3.6 μg of E-64/ml, 56 μg of benzamidine HCl/ml. Cells were washed once with ice-cold 5 mm KCl, 130 mm NaCl, 7.5 mmMgCl2 plus protease inhibitors, then incubated in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 10 mm KCl, 0.15 mm MgCl2 plus protease inhibitors and homogenized; mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation. For pulse-chase labelings, 10-cm dishes of exponentially growing cells were labeled for 2 h in methionine-free DMEM containing 250 μCi of [35S]methionine (>1,000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products Inc.), 5% dialyzed FBS, and 100 μg of emetine/ml. After labeling, cells were washed twice with DMEM containing 100 μg of emetine/ml and 2 mm unlabeled methionine, washed once with DMEM containing 2 mm unlabeled methionine, and then incubated in DMEM containing 2 mm unlabeled methionine and 5% dialyzed FBS at 37 °C. After the chase incubation, mitochondria were isolated from 3–4 10-cm dishes of cells by differential centrifugation (31.Chomyn A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 197-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and resuspended in 200 μl of 0.25 msucrose, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 150 μmMgCl2. For experiments with multiple chase incubations, cells from one 10-cm dish were lysed by the addition of 1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Labeled polypeptides from cell lysates or an isolated mitochondrial fraction were analyzed by Tricine-SDS 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE; Ref. 40.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) and either subjected to fluorography (NEN Intensify, Dupont) with Kodax Bio-Max MS film or analyzed with a Bio-Rad PhosphorImager (Molecular Imager). Levels of [35S]methionine incorporation into translated polypeptides were quantitated using Molecular Analyst software (Molecular Imager, Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation of COX was performed as described previously (42.Mariottini P. Chomyn A. Doolittle R. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3355-3362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A mitochondrial fraction (90–150 μg) isolated from pulse labeled or pulse-chase labeled cells was lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C in a total volume of 80 μl. Samples were then diluted 5-fold with IB buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mg of bovine serum albumin/ml, and 2 mm methionine) and pre-absorbed for 1 h at 4 °C with 125 μl of 10% (v/v) zysorbin (formaldehyde-fixed protein A-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) which was resuspended in IB buffer. After centrifugation, supernatants were removed and incubated for 1.5–2 h at 4 °C with 6–10 μl of antiserum or normal rabbit serum. Samples were then incubated for 30–120 min at 4 °C with 125 μl of 10% (v/v) zysorbin and 300–500 μg of a mitochondrial fraction which was isolated from unlabeled cells and lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100. Samples were centrifuged and pellets were washed once with IB buffer containing 0.1% SDS, once with IB buffer, and once with 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.7. The immunocomplexes were released by incubation at 37 °C in 30 μl of sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 12% glycerol, 0.02% Serva Blue G, 4% β-mercaptoethanol) and analyzed by Tricine-SDS 10% PAGE as described above. Two controls were performed in all immunoprecipitations, one using normal rabbit serum and another using a protein A-negative, formaldehyde-fixed S. aureus strain (Wood 46,Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The rabbit polyclonal antibodies against COX II were generously provided by Dr. R. Doolittle, University of California. To investigate the consequences of the 9480del15 COX III mutation on COX function, mitochondria from the patient with the COX III mutation were introduced into ρ0 cells. Two types of fusions were performed. In one, cytoplasts derived from enucleated cultured myoblasts and in another, platelet-leukocyte fractions isolated from blood, were fused with cells from the ρ0cell line 143B206. Following fusions, cells were plated in selective medium, containing 5-bromodeoxyuridine and lacking uridine. Since 143B206 cells are auxotrophic for pyrimidines due to their respiratory chain deficiency and are also thymidine kinase deficient, only 143B206 cells which received mitochondria from cytoplasts or platelets would be expected to grow. Individual clones were isolated from both myoblast and platelet-leukocyte fusions and were screened by PCR for the presence of the COX III mutation (Fig.1). Transmitochondrial cell lines containing the COX III mutation were obtained from the platelet-leukocyte fusions, but not from the myoblast fusions. Seventy-eight clonal cell lines derived from fusions with muscle satellite cells were homoplasmic for wild-type mtDNA. Of 102 clones that were analyzed from the platelet-leukocyte fusions, 99 were homoplasmic for wild-type mtDNA and three contained approximately 97–98% mutated mtDNA. The sharp dichotomy between mutation levels in cell clones suggested that the majority of platelets were homoplasmic for wild-type mtDNA with a few cells containing high levels of mutated mtDNA. These results were consistent with the level of mutation found in the patient's leukocytes (1%; Ref. 16.Keightley J.A. Hoffbuhr K.C. Burton M.D. Salas M.S. Johnston W.S.W. Penn A.M.W. Buist N.R.M. Kennaway N.G. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To obtain cell lines homoplasmic for the COX III deletion, the ratio of wild-type to mutated mtDNA was manipulated using ethidium bromide to inhibit mtDNA replication (27.King M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 339-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two cell lines containing high levels of the mutation (97–98% mutation; 51.112 and 51.129) were grown in the presence of ethidium bromide and uridine for 14 days. After removal of ethidium bromide and repopulation of mtDNA to normal levels within the cells, cells were plated to isolate colonies. Sixty-two colonies were chosen for expansion and analysis. To avoid selection against cells with a severe respiratory chain deficiency, a portion of the cells plated for colony isolation were grown in medium supplemented with uridine. Five clonal cell lines homoplasmic for the mutation were identified by PCR. The remaining cell lines contained either 100% wild-type mtDNA (31 clones) or were ρ0 (26 clones). The cell lines chosen for further studies included two homoplasmic for the COX III mutation (51.112.50 and 51.112.28), two with high levels of mutation (97–98% mutated mtDNA; 51.112 and 51.129), and two homoplasmic for the patient's wild-type mtDNA (52.144 and 51.118) (Fig. 1). In this paper, cells homoplasmic for the mutation will be referred to as 100% mutant cells, cells with mutation levels of 97–98% will be referred to as 97% mutant cells, and cells with 0% mutation (100% patient wild-type mtDNA) will be referred to as wild-type cells. Mutation levels in all cell lines were checked periodically and were stable over a period of several months of continuous culture. The mtDNA content per cell was quantitated by dot blot hybridization in all transmitochondrial cell lines and 143B (parental cell line of ρ0 cell line 143B206). The mtDNA content in wild-type cell lines was 95% (52.144) and 65% (51.118) of the mtDNA level"
https://openalex.org/W2032372415,Extraction of potassium into magmas and outgassing of argon during melting constrain the relative amounts of potassium in the crust with respect to those of argon in the atmosphere. No more than 30% of the modern mass of the continents was subducted back into the mantle during Earth's history. It is estimated that 50 to 70% of the subducted sediments are reincorporated into the deep continental crust. A consequence of the limited exchange between the continental crust and the upper mantle is that the chemistry of the upper mantle is driven by exchange of material with the deep mantle.
https://openalex.org/W2033959706,"V-type ATPase (VoV1) capable of ATP-driven H+ pumping and of H+ gradient driven ATP synthesis was isolated from a thermophilic eubacterium, Thermus thermophilus. When the enzyme was analyzed by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, it showed eight polypeptide bands of which four were subunits of V1. We also isolated the VoV1 operon, containing nine genes in the order of atpG-I-L-E-X-F-A-B-D, which encoded proteins with molecular sizes of 13, 43, 10, 20, 35, 11, 64, 53, and 25 kDa, respectively. The last four genes were identified as those for V1 subunits; atpA, B, D, and F encoded the A, B, γ, and δ subunits, respectively. The first five genes, atpG–atpX, were identified as genes for the Vo subunits. The product of atpL, the proteolipid subunit, lacked a 19-amino acid presequence and, unlike V-type ATPases, contained two membrane-spanning domains rather than four. The hydrophobic 43-kDa product of atpI is the smallest member so far found of the eukaryotic 100-kDa subunit family. Its electrophoretic band overlapped with the band of the A subunit. Therefore, all the gene products were found in our purified VoV1. We isolated the A3B3 subcomplex reconstituted from the isolated subunits and the A3B3γ subcomplex from subunit-expressing Escherichia coli. Electron microscopic observation of these subcomplexes revealed that the γ subunit of V1 filled the central cavity of A3B3 and might be central subunit, similar to the γ subunit of F1-ATPase.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12951-12954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 2.Fillingame R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 217-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FoF1 is responsible for ATP synthesis and is present in inner membranes of mitochondria, thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, and plasma membranes of bacteria (2.Fillingame R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 217-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). These enzymes are composed of a hydrophobic membrane part (Fo) and a hydrophilic catalytic part (F1). Fo forms a proton channel across the membranes and is composed of at least three kinds of transmembrane subunits, one of which is the most evolutionarily conserved 8-kDa proteolipid subunit (2.Fillingame R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 217-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). F1, which can easily be separated from the membranes and shows ATPase activity, is composed of two kinds of nucleotide binding subunits, α and β, and three minor subunits, γ, δ, and ε, with a stoichiometry α3β3γδε (2.Fillingame R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 217-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). The γ subunit penetrates the central cavity of the hexagonal α3β3 like a shaft (4.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar) and rotates when F1 hydrolyzes ATP (5.Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinoshita K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). On the other hand, VoV1 is present in the membranes of yeast vacuoles (6.Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1090-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), clathrin-coated vesicles (7.Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), chromaffine granules (8.Moriyama Y. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), lysosomes (9.Arai K. Simaya K. Hiratani N. Ohkuma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 5649-5660Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), and plant vacuoles (10.Lai S.P. Randall S.K. Sze H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16731-16737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in eukaryotic cells, and it pumps H+ into vesicles. Like FoF1, the VoV1 is composed of a water-soluble set of subunits (V1) and a membrane-integral set of subunits (Vo). The two major A and B subunits and other minor subunits comprise the V1 domain (1.Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12951-12954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The A and B subunits are homologous to the β and α subunits of FoF1. By analogy to F1, V1 has also been proposed to have a central shaft subunit that rotates in the A3B3 hexagon. However, an equivalent subunit with indisputable sequence homology to the F1γ subunit has not been identified in VoV1. The hydrophobic Vo is thought to be composed of at least five different subunits (1.Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12951-12954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 11.Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The 16-kDa proteolipid subunit containing four transmembrane domains is the major subunit of Vo (1.Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12951-12954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Unlike FoF1, V1 dissociates into individual subunits with concomitant loss of ATPase activity, and Vo does not show activity as a H+ channel by itself once V1 is detached from Vo (12.Zhang J. Myers M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9773-9778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously identified VoV1 in prokaryotic cells at first in archea and then in a thermophilic eubacterium, Thermus thermophilus (13.Inatomi K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 837-841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Konishi J. Wakagi T. Oshima T. Yoshida M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 102: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15.Nanba T. Mukohata Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 102: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 16.Yokoyama K. Oshima T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21946-21950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because T. thermophilus, a strict aerobe, does not have FoF1 but carries out oxidative phosphorylation, VoV1 is responsible for ATP synthesis in this eubacterium, and indeed, the VoV1 purified from this bacterium can catalyze ATP synthesis driven by H+ flow (17.Yokoyama K. Muneyuki E. Amano T. Mizutani S. Ishida M. Yoshida M. Ohkuma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20504-20510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Based on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE),1 the isolatedT. thermophilus VoV1 has been thought to be composed of eight kinds of polypeptides with the following apparent molecular sizes: 100, 66, 56, 38, 30, 24, 13, and 12 kDa (18.Yokoyama K. Akabane Y. Ishii N. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12248-12253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Four of them, A (66 kDa), B (56 kDa), γ (30 kDa), and δ (12 kDa), are found in the purified V1, whereas the 100-, 38-, 24-, and 13-kDa polypeptides are thought to be Vosubunits. In this study, to determine the subunit composition, we compared the nine genes in the T. thermophilusVoV1 operon and partial peptide sequences of polypeptides in the isolated VoV1. Furthermore, we reported the electron microscopic observation of the subcomplexes. Culturing and disruption of T. thermophilus cells were carried out as described (16.Yokoyama K. Oshima T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21946-21950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were precipitated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min and washed with 50 mm Tris-SO4 (pH 8.0) containing 5 mm MgSO4 five times to avoid contamination with soluble proteins. The washed membranes (30 g) were suspended in 100 ml of 50 mm Tris-SO4 (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgSO4, and 3% Triton X-100 (w/v), and the suspension was sonicated for 2 min. Debris and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (3 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-SO4 (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgSO4, and 0.2% Triton X-100. The column was washed with 200 ml of the same buffer. Proteins were eluted with a linear Na2SO4 gradient (0–0.2 m). Fractions containing VoV1 were identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis in the presence of an alkyl ether sulfate (Softy 12, LION Corp.; Ref. 18.Yokoyama K. Akabane Y. Ishii N. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12248-12253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They were combined and concentrated to 1 ml by ultrafiltration using a Mini-Module, model NM-3 (Funakoshi). The concentrated solution was applied to a Sephacryl S-300 column (1.8 × 90 cm) equilibrated with 50 mmTris-SO4 (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgSO4, 50 mm Na2SO4, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Proteins were eluted with the same buffer, and the fractions were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of alkyl ether sulfate and SDS. The fractions containing VoV1 were combined and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-SO4 (pH 8.0), 5 mmMgSO4 for 5 h. The dialyzed solution was applied to a Poros HQ/M (4.6 × 10 cm, PerSeptive Biosystems Corp.) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-SO4 (pH 8.0), 5 mmMgSO4, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m). The purity of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing VoV1 were combined, and the VoV1 was stored at 4 °C until use. Proteoliposomes containing VoV1 and bacteriorhodopsin (bR) were reconstituted at 25 °C in the reaction buffer (25 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3), 50 mmK2SO4, and 50 mmNa2SO4) according to the procedure described by Richard and co-workers (19.Pitard B. Richard P. Dunach M. Girault G. Rigaud J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20.Pitard B. Richard P. Dunach M. Rigaud J.L. Eur. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21571-21578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with minor modification. Unilamellar liposomes were prepared by reverse phase evaporation using phosphatidylcholine and resuspended at a lipid concentration of 4 mg/ml. For reconstitution of proteoliposomes, 850 μl of liposome solutions were mixed with 40 μl of 20% (w/v) Triton X-100, 10 μl of VoV1 or authentic FoF1 solution (3 mg protein/ml), and 50 μl of bR solution (4 mg protein/ml). Then, 40 μl of 14.8% ofn-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside was added. After a 2-min incubation, 10 μl of 20 mm pyranine solution in ethanol and wet Bio-Beads (80 mg) were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature while stirring. Addition of Bio-Beads and the 1-h incubation was repeated three times. The mixtures were washed twice with the reaction buffer by centrifugation (30 min, 150,000 ×g), and the pellet was suspended in 1 ml of the reaction buffer. A 200-μl aliquot of the proteoliposomes was mixed with 600 μl of the reaction buffer, and 2 mm ADP (final concentration) was added. The reaction mixture was preilluminated by the 300 W slide projector for 15 min on a magnet stirred at 40 °C. The reaction was started by addition of 2 mm (final concentration) MgSO4. At 10-min intervals, 50-μl aliquots were taken, and the reaction was stopped by addition of the same volume of 4% trichloroacetic acid. The amount of ATP was determined by the luciferin-luciferase assay method using a luminescense reader BLR201 (Aloka). ATP driven proton translocation into bR-VoV1 liposomes was detected by decrease of pyranine fluorescence. An aliquot of 150 μl of bR-VoV1 liposomes was preincubated at 25 °C in 2 ml of the reaction buffer supplemented with 7 mmMgSO4. The reaction was started by adding 2 mmATP-Mg. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 460 and 510 nm, respectively. Excess fluorecence from pyranine molecules not entrapped into bR-VoV1 liposomes was quenched by addition of 20 mm p-xylene-bispyridinium bromide. To obtain the 3′ region of the operon, the genomic DNA of T. thermophiluswas digested completely with StuI. DNA fragments of 2–3 kilobase pairs were ligated into the HincII site of pUC118. The recombinant plasmids obtained were then introduced intoEscherichia coli strain JM109. Based on the nucleotide sequence of the cloned 6.2-kilobase pair BamHI fragment (22.Tsutumi S. Yokoyama K. Denda K. Oshima T. Date T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1098: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which contains the 5′ region of the γ subunit gene, an oligonucleotide was synthesized and used to screen the transformed colonies (23.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cloning of the 5′ region of the atp operon was carried out in a similar manner. The nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method after subcloning the restriction fragments into pUC118 vector. All DNA sequences were confirmed by sequencing both strands. Computer searches to find proteins with sequence similarity were carried out using the protein sequence data bank of the National Biomedical Research Foundation and the SWISS-PROT protein sequence data bank. Comparisons of two sequences, hydropathy analysis, and multiple sequence alignments were carried out with GENETYX (Software Development Co., Ltd). Sequence data used for comparisons were taken from the references cited. The DNA fragment coding A, B, and D was polymerase chain reaction amplified using exTaqpolymerase (TaKaRa). The sequences of the amplified DNA fragments were confirmed using an ABI373A sequencer. The DNA fragment obtained was ligated into the EcoRI/SalI site of pTrc 99A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After transformation of E. coli. strain JM103, the expression of A3B3γ was induced by addition of 0.4 mm (final concentration) isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Purification of the recombinant A3B3γ complex expressed inE. coli was carried out as follows. The E. coliharboring the expression vector were grown in 2 liters of 2× YT containing 0.2 mm ampicillin at 37 °C. About 20 g of cells were obtained from 1 liter of overnight culture medium. Cells were suspended in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 50 mmNaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA and disrupted by sonication. The debris was removed by brief centrifugation. The cell lysate was incubated at 65 °C for 30 min, and insoluble denatured proteins were removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 60,000 × g. The supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (2 × 20 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA (buffer A). After the column was washed with buffer A, proteins were eluted with a 0–0.5 m NaCl linear gradient in buffer A. The fractions containing A3B3γ were combined. Supplemented with solid ammonium sulfate to 1.2 m and applied to a butyl-toyopearl column (2 × 10 cm) equilibrated with buffer A plus 1.2m ammonium sulfate. Proteins were eluted with a 1.2–0m ammonium sulfate reverse gradient in buffer A. The fractions containing A3B3γ were collected, and proteins were precipitated by addition of solid ammonium sulfate to 1.5 m. The precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation, dissolved in a minimum volume of buffer A, and applied to the Sephacryl S-300 column (1.8 × 90 cm) equilibrated with buffer A plus 0.1 m Na2SO4. The proteins were eluted with the same buffer, and the fractions containing A3B3γ were collected and stored at 4 °C until use. A3B3 complex was reconstituted from isolated A and B subunits prepared as described previously (17.Yokoyama K. Muneyuki E. Amano T. Mizutani S. Ishida M. Yoshida M. Ohkuma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20504-20510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Each subunit was precipitated by adding solid ammonium sulfate and then dissolved in 50 mm Tris-SO4 (pH 8.0) and 5 mm MgCl2. The final protein concentration of each subunit was 50 mg/ml. The subunits were mixed at an equal molar ratio. Then, 49 μl of the mixture was supplemented with 1 μl of 0.1m ATP-Mg and incubated at room temperature for 3 h. The incubated mixture was subjected to gel permeation high performance liquid chromatography (G-3000SWXL, Tosoh) and eluted with 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) and 0.1 mNa2SO4. The fractions containing the A3B3 complex were collected and analyzed immediately. The freshly prepared samples were diluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to final protein concentrations of 10–100 μg/ml, and the specimens on carbon support films were embedded in negative stain (2% uranyl acetate) using the drop method (24.Fujiyama Y. Yokoyama K. Yoshida M. Wakabayashi T. FEBS Letts. 1990; 271: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Specimens were examined with a Hitachi HF-2000 electron microscopy equipped with a minimal-dose system and an anti-contamination device. Grids were scanned at low magnification under dark illumination to reduce radiation damage. After adjusting the astigmatism and focus at adjacent areas, the photographs of the target specimen area were recorded on Kodak SO163 film using an electron dose of about 30 e/A2. The accelerating voltage was 200 kV, and the direct magnification was 50,000. Micrographs were digitized with a scanner (SCAI, Zeiss) at a pixel size of 0.14 nm for single particle analysis. About 40 particles were selected. The images were rotated to maximize correlation with each other and averaged after rejecting the particles that correlated poorly. All images were processed using the software we developed: the extensible object-oriented system (25.Yasunaga T. Wakabayashi T. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured at 25 °C with an enzyme-coupled ATP regenerating system (17.Yokoyama K. Muneyuki E. Amano T. Mizutani S. Ishida M. Yoshida M. Ohkuma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20504-20510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). One unit is defined as the activity that hydrolyses 1 μmol of ATP/min. The peptide sequence of subunits was determined as follows. Purified VoV1 was boiled in the SDS sample buffer for 5 min and subjected to 18 or 12% SDS-PAGE. The separated subunits were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Bio-Rad) and visualized by CBB-staining. Each subunit was analyzed using a peptide sequencer. bR and FoF1 prepared from thermophilic Bacillus PS3 were gifts from Dr. Dirk Bald. Previously, we reported isolation of VoV1 from T. thermophilus membranes using two column chromatography steps, i.e. DEAE cellulose and Sepharose 6B. However, a large amount of VoV1 was lost because of dissociation into V1 and Vo during the step of DEAE cellulose column chromatography, and the final preparation still contained some contamination (18.Yokoyama K. Akabane Y. Ishii N. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12248-12253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the dissociation of VoV1 was fairly suppressed by using DEAE-Sephacel instead of DEAE cellulose. To further improve the purity of VoV1, we also used ion exchange fast protein liquid chromatography for purification. The resultant isolated VoV1 migrated as an apparently single band on nondenaturing gel electrophoresis with no apparent contamination (Fig.1 a). The specific ATPase activity of the purified VoV1 was 4.4 (± 0.7) units/mg at 25 °C, comparable with the specific activity of V1 -ATPase (5.2 units/mg; Ref. 17.Yokoyama K. Muneyuki E. Amano T. Mizutani S. Ishida M. Yoshida M. Ohkuma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20504-20510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Finally, more than 10 mg of VoV1 was routinely obtained from 100 g of wet cells using this improved purification procedure. SDS-PAGE of the purified enzyme showed eight polypeptides with apparent molecular sizes of 66, 56, 38, 30, 24, 13, 12, and 9 kDa (Fig.1 b), four of which (66, 56, 30, and 12 kDa) were subunits of V1. After a short lag because of an initially inhibited form of VoV1 (17.Yokoyama K. Muneyuki E. Amano T. Mizutani S. Ishida M. Yoshida M. Ohkuma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20504-20510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), an apparent H+pumping activity was observed (Fig. 1 c). The lower rate of quenching by VoV1 than by FoF1 may be a reflection of ADP inhibition of VoV1 (17.Yokoyama K. Muneyuki E. Amano T. Mizutani S. Ishida M. Yoshida M. Ohkuma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20504-20510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). VoV1proteoliposomes reconstituted by dialysis or the freeze-thaw method (26.Kagawa Y. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) failed to show H+ pumping activity (date not shown). The VoV1 preparation was also capable of ATP synthesis; vesicles containing bR and VoV1synthesized ATP by illumination (Fig. 1 d). Neither bafilomycine A1 nor azide inhibitors of eukaryotic VoV1 (1.Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12951-12954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 27.Zhang J. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23518-23523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and F1-ATPase (28.Bald D. Amano T. Muneyuki E. Pitard B. Rigaud J.-L. Kruip J. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. Shibata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 865-870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), respectively, affected the illumination-driven ATP synthesis ofT. thermophilus VoV1(Fig.1 d). We cloned the entire operon of the VoV1, which contained nine genes in the order of atpG-I-L-E-X-F-A-B-D (Fig. 2). The sizes of the G–D genes were 360, 1188, 297, 561, 969, 324, 1749, 1434, and 681 base pairs, and the approximate molecular sizes of the encoded proteins are 13, 43, 10, 20, 35, 12, 64, 53, and 25 kDa, respectively. All of the nine genes have Shine-Dalgaerno sequences in their upstream regions (29.Murzina V.N. Voorozheykina P.D. Matvienko I.N. Nucleic Acids. Res. 1988; 16: 8172Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). At 17–50 bases downstream from the last codon of atpD, there is transcriptional termination signal (5′-GCCCGGGGGGTTCAGGCCCCCCGGGCTTTTTCTTT-3′), suggesting that atpD is the last gene in the operon. At 71–32 bases upstream from the initiation codon of atpG, there is a consensus sequence for a promoter of the T. thermophilus atp operon (5′-TTGACCTGCATCCTCCGCCGCCTAAGTATACTTAGGCGGGG-3′, consensus sequences and a probable transcriptional start point being underlined). Therefore, the operon contains no gene(s) other than the nine genes. The atpI gene is predicted to encode a 43-kDa polypeptide, but we could not find a protein band at the corresponding position in 18% SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 b). Therefore, we prepared an anti-atpI peptide antibody raised against the deduced peptide sequence359GHMLQPIRLLWVEFFTKF376 as an antigen and analyzed VoV1 with Western blotting. A 60-kDa polypeptide was stained with the antibody (data not shown). The position of the stained band overlapped with that of the A subunit, but the atpI product is not a component of V1 because there was no positive band in the V1 preparation. In fact, a new band appeared just below the band of the A subunit when VoV1 was analyzed with SDS-PAGE at a lower (12%) gel concentration (Fig.3 a, arrow). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of this polypeptide was VIAPMEKLVLAGPKG, which agreed with the predicted N-terminal sequence of the atpI product. Thus, the atpI product was contained in the purified VoV1 preparation, and we call it the 43-kDa subunit hereafter. The C-terminal ∼60-amino acid stretch of the 43-kDa subunit has sequence similarity to those of rat VPP1 (96 kDa; Ref. 30.Perin S.M. Fried A.V. Stone K.D. Xie X. Sudhof C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3877-3881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Saccharomyces cerevisiae STV1 (95 kDa; Ref. 31.Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W.

Yamato I. Konishi K. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11037-11044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 b). The hydropathy plot of the 43-kDa subunit indicated that this stretch contained a large hydrophobic region that is commonly observed for the homologues mentioned above (Fig. 3 c). atpL encodes a highly hydrophobic 10-kDa polypeptide with three apparent transmembrane domains (Fig. 4 b), and its sequence shows significant sequence similarity to the sequences of the proteolipid subunits of FoF1 and VoV1 (Fig. 4 a). The glutamic acid residue that plays an essential role in H+ conduction (2.Fillingame R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 217-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is conserved at position 57 in the predicted transmembrane domain. Previously, no protein band of the corresponding molecular size was found in SDS-PAGE of VoV1 (Fig. 4 c,lane 2) (18.Yokoyama K. Akabane Y. Ishii N. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12248-12253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a 5-min boiling prior to electrophoresis in 2% SDS resulted in appearance of a new 9-kDa polypeptide band with concomitant disappearance of the 100-kDa band, which was previously interpreted as a candidate for a subunit of Vo (18.Yokoyama K. Akabane Y. Ishii N. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12248-12253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 c, shown by anasterisk). Analysis of the N-terminal sequence of the 9-kDa band (and also the 100-kDa band) revealed that the protein in the band was a product of atpL but lacked the N-terminal 19 amino acid residues that constituted the putative first transmembrane domain (Fig.4 b). Consequently, the proteolipid subunit of T. thermophilus VoV1 contains two rather than three transmembrane helices. The real molecular size of the subunit is approximately 8 kDa, and we therefore call it the 8-kDa subunit hereafter. It was already known that atpA and atpB encode the A and B subunits of V1 part (22.Tsutumi S. Yokoyama K. Denda K. Oshima T. Date T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1098: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To identify the remaining five gene products, we compared the partial peptide sequences of the putative subunit bands in SDS-PAGE and deduced amino acid sequences of the genes (data not shown). The results showed that the products of atpF and atpD are δ and γ subunits of V1 part, respectively, and that the products of atpG, atpE, and atpX are 13-, 24-, and 38-kDa subunits of Vo part, respectively. The names 24- and 38-kDa subunits are changed to 20- and 35-kDa subunit hereafter. These Vo subunits are hydrophilic proteins rather than transmembrane protein; hence these subunits may be associated directly or indirectly with the hydrophobic subunits of Vo. Thus, the products of all of nine genes in the operon are found in the VoV1 preparation, and the VoV1 is composed of nine kinds of subunits, four in V1 and five in Vo. We searched amino acid sequence similarity of 13-, 20-, and 35-kDa subunits of Vo and γ and δ subunits of V1 from T. thermophilus to the subunits of VoV1 from other organisms. The amino acid residues of the 20-kDa subunit are 22.4, 18.7, and 19.4% identical with those of E. hirae ntpE (33.Takase K. Kakinuma S. Yamato I. Konishi K. Igarashi K. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol.

Science. 1999; 286: 1153-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) described a genomic strategy for identifying yeast genes encoding biochemical activities. A total of 6,144 strains were constructed, with each containing a plasmid having a different open reading frame fused to glutathioneS-transferase (GST) and under control of the PCUP1 promoter. The open reading frame YHR109w was associated with an activity that methylated horse cytochromec but not bovine serum albumin (BSA) (17.Martzen M.R. McCraith S.M. Spinelli S.L. Torres F.M. Field S. Grayhack E.J. Phizicky E.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1153-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, vertebrate cytochromes c are not trimethylated and can serve as substrates for yeast methyltransferase. We show here that YHR109w, now denoted Ctm1p, is sufficient for specifically trimethylating Lys-72 of iso-1-cytochrome c in yeast. Most importantly, iso-1-cytochrome c purified from a disrupted ctm1-Δ strain was not methylated in vivo, and Ctm1p did not methylate in vitro the mutant form of iso-1-cytochrome c having a K72R replacement. Unless stated otherwise, yeast were grown at 30 °C in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) or YPG (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glycerol) media or in SD (synthetic glucose) medium containing appropriate supplements (18.Sherman F.

Yeast were grown anaerobically in YP10%D (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 10% glucose), which was made oxygen-free by flushing the system with nitrogen that was purified with Oxygen-trap (Alltech Associates, Inc., Deerfield, IL). The medium was subsequently kept anaerobic throughout the experiment with a constant flow of nitrogen gas. The strains used in this study, listed in Table I, included the following isogenic series: the normal parental strain B-6978 (CTM1), which produces normal iso-1-cytochrome cbut lacks iso-2-cytochrome c because of thecyc7–67 deletion; B-12331 (ctm1-Δ), in which the CTM1 gene is disrupted; and B-12462 (ctm1-Δ p[CTM1]), which contains the plasmid pAB2560 that complements the ctm1-Δ deficiency.

The gene encoding the Ctm1p-Myc protein was constructed with the epitope tagged at the C terminus by using the following two synthetic primers, where the sequence in bold corresponds to the c-Myc epitope DMEQKLISEEDLN, and where the underlined segments correspond, respectively, toSalI and NheI restriction sites: the downstream primer, 5′-AGAAGAAAGGTCGACTAAAATCAATTCAAGTCCTCTTCGGAAATGAGCTTCTGCTCCATATCCTGAAAGAAA-3′; and the upstream primer, 5′-GAAGGATAATACCGCTAGCTAGACAATCTTA-3′, with the position of the 5′-end at −200 nucleotides of the CTM1gene. The product of the polymerase chain reaction, whose sequence was verified by DNA sequencing, contains the native promoter and theCTM1 gene fused to the segment encoding the c-Myc epitope at the C terminus. The ctm1-Δ strain B-12331 was transformed with plasmid pAB2578 that was obtained by ligating theNheI–SalI fragment of CTM1-Myc to theSpeI–SalI sites of plasmid pAA625 (pRS316). The resulting CTM1-Myc strain, B-12588, was used for subcellular localization studies of Ctm1p. Expression of CMT1 was carried out with the pET System, using the pET15b plasmid and the E. coli strain BL21, as described in the pET System manual (Novagen, Madison, WI). Total RNA was isolated from approximately 108 cells as described by Russo et al. (23.Russo P. Li W.-Z. Hampsey D.M. Zaret K.S. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Enriched poly(A) RNA was isolated from a total of 1 mg of total RNA with the Oligotex mRNA kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valentia, CA) as recommended by the vendor. Northern blot analyses of different mRNAs were carried out as described previously (23.Russo P. Li W.-Z. Hampsey D.M. Zaret K.S. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Messenger RNA levels were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Model 425E, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and finally normalized against ACT1 mRNA signals. The yeast cell extracts were prepared by disrupting the cells with glass beads in Buffer A containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After vortexing 6 times for a total of 3 min, the lysates were clarified by low speed centrifugation. The membrane fraction was obtained by centrifuging the cell extracts at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting pellet was solubilized in Buffer A containing 1.0% Triton X-100. The supernatant contained cytosolic proteins. The mitochondrial protein fraction was prepared separately by the procedure described by Daum et al. (24.Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aliquots of the samples from cytosolic, membrane, and mitochondrial fractions, as well as total cell extract, were loaded on Laemmli 10% SDS polyacrylamide gels (25.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and the separated proteins were transferred to ECL nitrocellulose filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a standard running condition of 3 h at 75 v as described by Towbin et al. (26.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1979; 76: 4350-4355Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the filters were probed with anti-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody (Babco, Richmond, CA). A total of 15 μg of protein from total cell extracts and 5 μg of protein from cellular fractions were loaded on the gel. After Western blotting, the filters were developed by using ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Yeast cells of the strain B-12588 were stained by standard indirect immunofluorescence technique with mouse anti-Myc antibody. Briefly, cells were grown to early log phase in a synthetic medium lacking uracil, collected, and fixed in formaldehyde. Subsequently the cells were treated with zymolyase for 5 min, at which time the reaction was blocked in phosphate-buffered saline/BSA solution. Spheroplasts were incubated for 1 h with anti-Myc antibody and for 30 min with anti-mouse IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate. After extensive washing, the cells were examined with an Olympus microscope containing a fluorescein filter. The amounts of iso-1-cytochromesc, as well as the other cytochromes, were determined by spectrophotometric recordings of intact cells at −196 °C, as described previously (27.Hickey D.R. Jayaraman K. Goodhue C.T. Shah J. Clements J.M. Tsunasawa S. Sherman F. Gene. 1991; 105: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The degree of trimethylation of iso-1-cytochrome c was estimated by direct amino acid compositional analysis. Iso-1-cytochromesc were purified by two rounds of chromatography on weak cation-exchange BioRex70 column, first with 100–200 mesh and subsequently with 200–400 mesh (Bio-Rad) in potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with a 0 to 1.0 m KCl linear gradient. If necessary, the protein samples were concentrated with a Centricon-3 device after chromatography (Amicon-Millipore, Bedford, MA). The amino acid composition of 500-pmol samples of purified iso-1-cytochromesc were analyzed after hydrolysis at 110 °C in vacuo for 24 h in 5.7 m HCl. Analyses were carried out with a Hewlett Packard system, using ODS Hypersil (C18 reverse phase type), 5 μm, 200 × 2.1-mm column. The peaks for each amino acid, including trimethyllysine, were identified by comparison of the HPLC profiles with the HPLC profiles produced with known amino acid mixtures. Yeast strain MRM2122 was homogenized with glass beads and GST-Ctm1p was purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography as described previously (17.Martzen M.R. McCraith S.M. Spinelli S.L. Torres F.M. Field S. Grayhack E.J. Phizicky E.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1153-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), yielding 0.4 μg/μl of protein. (His)6-Ctm1p was purified from E. coli following the protocols described in the Talon Metal Affinity Resins User Manual (protocol PT1320-1, version PR96975) from CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA), yielding 1.9 μg/μl of protein. Methyltransferase assay was performed in a total volume of 100 μl, containing 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 2 mm EDTA, 4 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg of iso-1-cytochrome c (unless stated otherwise) or other substrate, 1 μl of [3H]SAM (0.55 μCi, 70 Ci/mmol, and corresponding to 80 nm), and 1–5 μl of purified Ctm1p or of crude extracts. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h, placed on ice, and 125 μl of 10 mg/ml BSA and 950 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid were added. Tubes were quickly frozen with dry ice and thawed on wet ice and then centrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were washed with 1 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid and dissolved in 150 μl of 88% formic acid. A total of 3 ml of Eco-scint (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) were added, and [ 3H]methylated products were counted in a Beckman scintillation counter and corrected for controls lacking methyltransferase. Martzen et al. (17.Martzen M.R. McCraith S.M. Spinelli S.L. Torres F.M. Field S. Grayhack E.J. Phizicky E.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1153-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) previously reported that the open reading frame, YHR109w, was associated with an activity that methylated horse cytochrome c, but not BSA, as measured by incorporation of [3H]SAM into acid-precipitable counts. We have further investigated the role of the YHR109w, now denoted Cmt1p, as a methyltransferase by examining a wider range of substrates and by using more highly purified Ctm1p. As summarized in Table II, GST-Ctm1p prepared from strain MRM2122 (Table I) acted on horse cytochromec, but not significantly on eight other proteins, or on tRNA or bulk DNA. At low substrate concentration, the [3H]methyl group incorporation in non-cytochrome csamples was less than 2% of the incorporation found with cytochromec.Table IIIncorporation (pmol of [ 3 H]methyl groups transferred per h) of [ 3 H]SAM into various substrates catalyzed by Ctm1p prepared from either S. cerevisiae or E. coliSubstrateSource of Ctm1pS. cerevisiaeE. coli280 μg98 μg28 μg50 μgHorse cytochromec1.892.031.833.81Aldolase0.0620.0150.0140.048Catalase0.0550.0380.0130.051Chymotrypsin0.0370.0280.0250.053Ferritin0.0830.0490.0310.057Ovalbumin0.0510.0160.0150.051Thyroglobulin0.2140.0510.0100.081Bovine serum albumin0.1070.0730.0350.048Histone H3 and H400.0020.0080.092tRNA0.0010.00300.056DNA0.004000.044 Open table in a new tab Furthermore, we established that Ctm1p encodes the observed methyltransferase activity, rather than simply co-purifying with the activity. First, overproduction of GST-Ctm1p in yeast yielded extracts with more activity, as expected if it were the rate-limiting component of activity. Second, expression of (His)6-Ctm1p in E. coli resulted in an activity acting with a high specificity on cytochrome c (Table II). In fact, approximately 75% pure preparations of GST-Ctm1p from yeast and of (His)6-Ctm1p from E. coli had approximately the same specific activities over a range of enzyme concentrations (Fig. 1). Thus, Ctm1p is sufficient by itself to act as a methyltransferase specifically for cytochromec. Comparisons of the deduced Ctm1p open reading frame, presented in Fig.2 A, to various data bases by using BLAST in different variations (28.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) did not reveal any significant overall similarity to any other protein. Also Ctm1p did not contain any of the known motifs (motif I and posts-I, -II, or -III) deduced from a large number of SAM-dependent methyltransferases (29.Kagan R.M. Clark S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 30.Niewmierzycka A. Clark S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 814-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, a Protein Data Bank Blast, which is based on 3-dimensional structures, revealed that a Ctm1p region spanning approximately 100 amino acids was similar to a region of the rRNA methyltransferase fromStreptococcus pneumoniae that methylates an adenine of 23 S ribosomal RNA, preventing macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin antibiotics from binding to the ribosome and thus causing antibiotic resistance (31.Yu L. Petros A.M. Schuchel A. Zhong P. Walter K. Holtzman T.F. Fesik S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, the 99 amino acid regions of Ctm1p and rRNA methyltransferase were 24% identical and 44% similar. However, the functional significance of this similarity is unknown. The critical evidence that CTM1 encodes the methyltransferase that trimethylates Lys-72 in iso-1-cytochrome c came from the amino acid compositional analysis of iso-1-cytochrome c from the ctm1-Δ strain. The ctm1-Δ strain was prepared by replacing the CTM1 gene with kanMX4gene (Table I). As discussed below, the ctm1-Δ strain contained the normal level of iso-1-cytochrome c. However, as shown in Fig. 3, trimethyllysine could not be detected in iso-1-cytochrome c from thectm1-Δ strain. Furthermore, trimethyllysine was present at the normal level in iso-1-cytochrome c from strain B-12462 (Table I), in which the CTM1 gene was reintroduced in thectm1-Δ strain (data not presented). We have also provided evidence that Ctm1p methylates exclusively Lys-72in vitro. Iso-1-cytochrome c from strain B-6978, containing normal iso-1-cytochrome c with Tml72, is a much poorer substrate than that from B-12331, containing iso-1-cytochromec that is not trimethylated (TableIII). Presumably, the 4% low level of incorporation in iso-1-cytochrome c from the normal strain is due to the fact that cytochromes c from normal strains are not completely methylated in vivo and are approximately 5–10% unmethylated (15.DiMaria P. Polastro E. DeLange R.J. Kim S. Paik W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4645-4652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More importantly, iso-1-cytochromec with the K72R replacement (19.Holzschu D. Principio L. Taylor K. Hickey D.R. Short J. Rao R. McLendon G. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7125-7131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had no significant level of methylation (Table III).Table IIIIncorporation (pmol of [ 3 H]methyl groups transferred per h) of [ 3 H]SAM into various forms of iso-1-cytochrome c, catalyzed in vitro by the Ctm1p methyltransferaseSource of iso-1-cytochrome cIncorporationStrain no.Relevant genotypePosition 72Expt. 1 aExpt., experiment.Expt. 2Relative percentB-12331ctm1-Δ CYC1 +Lys4.924.76100B-6978CTM1 + CYC1 +Tml0.210.184.1B-6765CTM1 + CYC1–784Arg00.00450.05a Expt., experiment. Open table in a new tab The lack of methylation at any site other than Lys-72 is consistent with the results of Takakura et al. (32.Takakura H. Yamamoto T. Sherman F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2642-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), who investigated the amino acid sequence requirement for trimethylation of Lys-72 by examining 21 altered iso-1-cytochromes c having single replacements in the region encompassing residues 67 through 77. Their study revealed that tyrosine 74 is critical for trimethylation of Lys-72, whereas replacements at other positions did not produce significant diminutions. However, other similarly spaced lysine and tyrosine residues at other sites in the protein did not result in trimethylation of the lysine residue. Thus, a properly situated aromatic residue, determined by the overall conformation of apocytochrome c in the vicinity of Lys-72, appears to be essential for trimethylation. The cellular location of Ctm1p was investigated with strain B-12588 containing the epitope-tagged allele CTM1-Myc. Indirect immunofluorescence staining revealed that Ctm1p was uniformly distributed throughout the cell, consistent with the view that Ctm1p is located primarily in the cytosol (data not presented). More importantly, subcellular fractionation studies also revealed that Ctm1p is located in the cytosol, with only insignificant levels in mitochondria (Fig.4). The slight difference in mobility of Ctm1p in the figure is due to a higher concentration of total protein in lane T, including membrane proteins and other cellular components, which reduces migration. Although the anti-Myc antibody produced a nonspecific background, similar Ctm1p bands were observed with cellular fractions using anti-GST antibody and strain MRM2122 (data not presented). Finding Ctm1p in the cytosol is consistent with early studies suggesting that the methyltransferase acts on apocytochromec in the cytosol before imported in mitochondria and before heme attachment. Holocytochrome c was found to be a poorer substrate than apocytochrome c, which was prepared either from holocytochrome c or by translation in vitro(15.DiMaria P. Polastro E. DeLange R.J. Kim S. Paik W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4645-4652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Park K.S. Frost B.F. Tuck M. Ho L.L. Kim S. Paik W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14702-14708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, both apocytochrome c and holocytochromec lost their substrate capability when bound to mitochondria in low ionic conditions, but this capability was restored when the cytochromes c were released from the mitochondria by KCl treatment. Interestingly, cycloheximide inhibited both protein synthesis and methylation (34.Farooqui J. Kim S. Paik W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4468-4473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results taken together suggest that nascent apocytochrome c is methylated in vivo, probably co-translationally, before being associated with mitochondria (15.DiMaria P. Polastro E. DeLange R.J. Kim S. Paik W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4645-4652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Park K.S. Frost B.F. Tuck M. Ho L.L. Kim S. Paik W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14702-14708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isogenic CTM1 and ctm1-Δ strains did not differ in their growth as determined by testing diluted suspension on various media and conditions, including growth at 30 and 37 °C on rich yeast extract- and peptone-containing media, or synthetic media with a variety of different carbon sources such as glucose, ethanol, lactate, or glycerol. In particular, no difference was observed on synthetic lactate medium, which is especially sensitive for revealing functional defects in cytochrome c (35.Sherman F. Stewart J.W. Jackson M. Gilmore R.A. Parker J.H. Genetics. 1974; 77: 255-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the same comparative growth of the two strains was observed on media containing 1M NaCl or KCl and media adjusted to pH values of 8.0, 8.5, or 9.0. As expected, the isogenic CTM1 and ctm1-Δ strains contained the same level of iso-1-cytochrome c, as well as the same level of the other cytochromes (Fig.5). Thus, our studies, as well as previous studies, have not revealed the biological function and importance of cytochrome cmethylation. The results of some experiments performed in vitro led to the suggestion that Tml72 is required for mitochondrial import of cytochrome c in yeast (33.Park K.S. Frost B.F. Tuck M. Ho L.L. Kim S.

Biochem. 1991; 23: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). On the other hand, pulse-chase experiments suggested that Tml72 protected cytochrome c from proteolytic degradation in vivo (40.Farooqui J. DiMaria P. Kim S. Paik W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5041-5045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of a 40-h chase period, the extent of degradation of the unmethylated form was three times higher than that of the methylated form. However, cycloleucine, used to inhibit cytochrome c methylation, could have also affected the protein degradation system. Ceesay et al. (41.Ceesay K.J. Rider L.R. Bergman L.W. Tuck M.T. Int. J. Biochem. 1994; 26: 721-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) also investigated the turnover of iso-1-cytochrome c having amino acid replacements at positions 71–74 and, consequently, different levels of trimethylation of Lys-72. Although the K72R iso-1-cytochrome c had the shortest half-life, 9 h compared with 23 h for the normal protein, there was no significant correlation between the half-life and the degree of trimethylation of Lys-72 among the 6 other iso-1-cytochromes c having various replacements. Pollock et al. (42.Pollock W.B. Rosell F.I. Twitchett M.B. Dumont M.E. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6124-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) reported that the alkaline conformational transition of the Lys-72 iso-1-cytochrome cwas approximately 0.6 pK a units lower than the Tml72 iso-1-cytochrome c and suggested that the role of Lys-72 methylation was to diminish an alkaline conformer at high pH values. However, the biological significance of this alkaline transition is unclear, and we did not observe difference of growth on lactate and other media at high pH values (see above). The function of trimethylated Lys-72 has been investigated in yeast by examining the consequences of K72R (19.Holzschu D. Principio L. Taylor K. Hickey D.R. Short J. Rao R. McLendon G. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7125-7131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and K72D (32.Takakura H. Yamamoto T. Sherman F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2642-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) replacements. Spectroscopic measurements revealed that K72R and K72D iso-1-cytochromes c were at normal or near normal levels. Furthermore, growth in lactate medium indicated that the K72R iso-1-cytochrome c had normal or near normal activityin vivo (19.Holzschu D. Principio L. Taylor K. Hickey D.R. Short J. Rao R. McLendon G. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7125-7131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On one hand, the maintenance of Lys-72 in 96 different species, except Tetrahymena pyriformis (43.Moore G.R. Pettigrew G.W. Cytochromes c, Evolutionary, Structural & Physicochemical Aspects. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 115-125Google Scholar), and the maintenance of the apparently specific methylase in numerous plant and fungal species indicate that Lys-72 or Tml72 is essential from an evolutionary point of view. On the other hand, the results with the K72R and K72D iso-1-cytochromes c indicate that a lysine or trimethylated lysine at position 72 is not absolutely required for biosynthesis, mitochondrial import, or activity, and the residue at this position is not critical. It should be noted that conserved residues at other sites in iso-1-cytochrome c also can be replaced without drastically effecting its biosynthesis or function (44.Hampsey D.M. Das G. Sherman F. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Because Lys-72 is at most only marginally critical for function, the role of methylation may be difficult to assess, especially fromin vitro studies, and the biological function of trimethylation remains to be elucidated. The importance of Lys-72 for interaction of cytochrome c with various physiological partners, including cytochrome c 1, cytochromec oxidase, cytochrome c peroxidase, and cytochrome b 2 (45.Rieder R. Bosshard H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6045-6053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46.Rieder R. Bosshard H.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1978; 253: 149-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that Tml72 may serve a subtle role in one or more of these interactions. Liao and Sherman (49.Liao H.N. Sherman F. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 138: 853-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) previously reported that the activity of the methyltransferase was lower in extracts of yeast grown under conditions of catabolite repression or anaerobiosis, the same conditions under which cytochrome c is low. Also, during anaerobic to aerobic adaptation, the methyltransferase was induced with cytochromec, indicating that the synthesis of cytochrome cand the methylase are at least partially coordinately regulated. We have extended these studies by examining the levels ofCTM1 and CYC1 mRNAs in cells grown under the same conditions used by Liao and Sherman (49.Liao H.N. Sherman F. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 138: 853-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results clearly revealed that the coordinate regulation of cytochrome c and Ctm1p occurs at the transcriptional level (Fig.6). Even though the two studies were conducted with two different sets of isogenic strains, a comparison of our results with CTM1 and CYC1 mRNAs and the results of Liao and Sherman (49.Liao H.N. Sherman F. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 138: 853-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with methyltransferase activity and iso-1-cytochrome c were remarkably similar (Fig.7).Figure 7Relative levels of (A) CTM1and CYC1 mRNAs and (B) cytochromec methyltransferase (Ctmp1) activity and iso-1- cytochrome c.

The high specificity of Ctm1p for methylating cytochrome cand the coordinate regulation of CTM1 and CYC1further support the view that this methyltransferase evolved to act specifically and efficiently on cytochrome c. Although likely, it remains to be seen whether cytochrome c is the sole substrate of Ctm1p.

https://openalex.org/W1596344466,"Human DNA topoisomerase IIα (topo II), a ubiquitous nuclear enzyme, is essential for normal and neoplastic cellular proliferation and survival. Several common anticancer drugs exert their cytotoxic effects through interaction with topo II. In experimental systems, altered topo II expression has been associated with the appearance of drug resistance. This mechanism, however, does not adequately account for clinical cases of resistance to topo II-directed drugs. Modulation by protein-protein interactions represents one mechanism of topo II regulation that has not been extensively defined. Our laboratory has identified 14-3-3ε as a topo II-interacting protein. In this study, glutathioneS-transferase co-precipitation, affinity column chromatography, and immunoprecipitations confirm the authenticity of these interactions. Three assays evaluate the impact of 14-3-3ε on distinct topo II functional properties. Using both a modified alkaline comet assay and a DNA cleavage assay, we demonstrate that 14-3-3ε negatively affects the ability of the chemotherapeutic, etoposide, to trap topo II in cleavable complexes with DNA, thereby preventing DNA strand breaks. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay, this appears to be due to reduced DNA binding activity. The association of topo II with 14-3-3 proteins does not extend to all 14-3-3 isoforms. No protein interaction or disruption of topo II function was observed with 14-3-3ς. Human DNA topoisomerase IIα (topo II), a ubiquitous nuclear enzyme, is essential for normal and neoplastic cellular proliferation and survival. Several common anticancer drugs exert their cytotoxic effects through interaction with topo II. In experimental systems, altered topo II expression has been associated with the appearance of drug resistance. This mechanism, however, does not adequately account for clinical cases of resistance to topo II-directed drugs. Modulation by protein-protein interactions represents one mechanism of topo II regulation that has not been extensively defined. Our laboratory has identified 14-3-3ε as a topo II-interacting protein. In this study, glutathioneS-transferase co-precipitation, affinity column chromatography, and immunoprecipitations confirm the authenticity of these interactions. Three assays evaluate the impact of 14-3-3ε on distinct topo II functional properties. Using both a modified alkaline comet assay and a DNA cleavage assay, we demonstrate that 14-3-3ε negatively affects the ability of the chemotherapeutic, etoposide, to trap topo II in cleavable complexes with DNA, thereby preventing DNA strand breaks.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). It is through interactions, in part, with topo II that several widely used cancer chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. doxorubicin, etoposide) exert their cytotoxic effects (2.Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 3.Hande K.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Unlike simple competitive inhibitors, these agents trap topo II in covalent complexes with DNA, transforming the enzyme into a required co-factor for cytotoxicity. In experimental model systems, changes in the expression of topo II have been associated with the appearance of antitumor drug resistance (4.Mirski S.E. Cole S.P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2129-2134PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Danks M.K. Warmoth M.R. Friche E. Granzen B. Bugg B.Y. Harker W.G. Zwelling L.A. Futscher B.W. Suttle D.P. Beck W.T.

This mechanism, however, is unable to account for clinical cases of resistance to topo II-directed drugs, implying that alternative topo II regulatory mechanisms require consideration (7.Kaufmann S.H.

Modulation by protein-protein interactions represents one mechanism of topo II regulation that has been largely underappreciated. Interaction of the transcription factors CREB, ATF-2, and c-Jun with topo II stimulates topo II DNA decatenation activity in vitro (9.Kroll D.J. Sullivan D.M. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Hoeffler J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 305-318PubMed Google Scholar), while association of wild-type retinoblastoma protein with topo II decreases this DNA decatenation activity (10.Bhat U.G. Raychaudhuri P. Beck W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7859-7864Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Yeast topo II, in addition to associating with nuclear scaffold proteins and proteins involved in chromosomal segregation (11.Gasser S.M. Laroche T. Falquet J. Boy de la Tour Laemmli U.K. J. Mol.

Hickson I.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 253-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Cells lacking the Sgs1 protein (Sgs1p) exhibit a slow growth phenotype due to the inability to completely decatenate DNA. The finding that Sgs1p is required in concert with topo II for completely faithful chromosomal segregation now appears to be significant in human neoplasia. A defect in the human homolog of Sgs1p, BLM, appears to be the genetic basis of Bloom's syndrome, a human disease of genetic instability (15.Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J. Cell. 1995; 83: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Clearly, continued characterization of topo II protein-protein interactions will yield new and important roles for the enzyme and may reveal implications for these interactions in cellular sensitivity to topo II-directed chemotherapeutics. Previous work in the laboratory led to the isolation of several topo II-interacting proteins (TIPs) (16.Kroll D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We have now identified one of these as the epsilon isoform of the human 14-3-3 protein (14-3-3ε) and independently isolated a 14-3-3ε cDNA from screening a human HeLa cell cDNA expression library with a radiolabeled, 80-kDa C-terminal fragment of human topo II protein. The 14-3-3 proteins belong to a well conserved family of seven isoforms (17.Reuther G.W. Pendergast A.M. Vitam. Horm. 1996; 52 (149–175): 149-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition to binding cruciform DNA structures (18.Todd A. Cossons N. Aitken A. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14317-14325Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), 14-3-3 proteins have been characterized as preferentially binding serine phosphorylated proteins and are implicated in the regulation of signal transduction pathways and cell cycle-associated proteins (reviewed in Refs. 17.Reuther G.W.

Among their reported functions, 14-3-3 proteins have been demonstrated to: (a) bind the protein kinases Raf1 (20.Freed E. Symons M. Macdonald S.G. McCormick F. Ruggieri R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24865-24872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) during phases of the cell cycle and in response to DNA damage. This present study characterizes the interaction between topo II and 14-3-3ε and presents evidence suggesting that this association modulates topo II-DNA interactions and drug-stabilized cleavable complex formation. HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells, HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells, and CCRF/CEM human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). HeLa cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), and HL-60 and CCRF/CEM cells were maintained as suspension cultures in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Both media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. To identify unknown protein interactive partners of topo II, approximately 1 × 106 plaques of a HeLa cDNA library in λgt11 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were plated at a density of 20,000 plaque-forming units/150-mm plate. Protein induction was accomplished by overlaying plates with 132-mm nitrocellulose filters soaked in 10 mm isopropylthio-β-galactoside. Filter lifts were subjected to a protein denaturing/renaturing protocol (37.Blanar M.A. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), blocked and probed as described previously (9.Kroll D.J. Sullivan D.M. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Hoeffler J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 305-318PubMed Google Scholar), but using125I-human topo II (amino acids 857–1448) as the interaction probe. Expression and purification of this recombinant protein have been detailed elsewhere (9.Kroll D.J. Sullivan D.M. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Hoeffler J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 305-318PubMed Google Scholar). Filters were washed extensively prior to autoradiography. Putative positive clones were plated for two additional cycles of screening until plaque purification was achieved. Selected cDNA clones were obtained by polymerase chain reaction using λgt11 primers and the PCR products directly cloned in the T-tailed sequencing vector, pCRII (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). One TIP clone was identical to the DNA sequence corresponding to amino acids 126–255 (terminus) of the epsilon form of human 14-3-3 protein. Full-length 14-3-3ε cDNA was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using a dilution of HeLa cDNA library as the template and was subcloned in frame with glutathioneS-transferase (GST) in pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to enable prokaryotic expression and affinity purification of the resulting chimeric protein (GST14-3-3ε). The co-precipitation method of Conklin et al.(38.Conklin D.S. Galaktionov K. Beach D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7892-7896Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) was employed. Briefly, 10–200 μg of purified GST14-3-3ε peptides or GST alone was incubated with 20 μg of topo II peptide (amino acids 857–1448) in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.1% BSA for 16 h at 4 °C. In experiments where interactions of full-length proteins were investigated, CCRF/CEM nuclear extract was used as the topo II source. Portions of the nuclear extract were treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Life Technologies, Inc.) (1 unit/6 μg of extract) prior to incubation with GST fusion proteins in a buffer containing 40 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Complexes were subsequently precipitated by the addition of 10 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated on ice on a rotating shaker. Beads were allowed to settle, washed three times in binding buffer, then heated to 95 °C in 2× Laemmli SDS sample buffer. Following SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer, blots were probed with a polyclonal antiserum to human topo IIα. CCRF-CEM extracts were prepared by sonication in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA: PBS + 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS with Complete™ protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, and the phosphatase inhibitors 10 mm NaF and 10 mm Na3VO4). Extracts (25–500 μg of total protein) were brought up to 500 μl of RIPA and pre-cleared with 20 μl of a 50% slurry of Protein A/Protein G-agarose beads with rocking for 1 h on ice. Cleared extracts were then incubated with 5 μl of polyclonal antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) to 14-3-3ε (T-16), a broad spectrum 14-3-3 antiserum that recognizes all mammalian isoforms (K-19), or a c-Myb monoclonal antibody as a control. Following a 2-h incubation on ice, complexes were precipitated by a 30-min incubation with another 20 μl of Protein A/Protein G-agarose. Complexes were washed three times with 500 μl of RIPA, then released by boiling for 5 min in 2× Laemmli SDS sample buffer, followed by immunoblotting for topo IIα. For affinity chromatography, the large C-terminal fragment of topo II (amino acids 857–1448) was expressed in Escherichia coli as a polyhistidine fusion protein as described previously (9.Kroll D.J. Sullivan D.M. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Hoeffler J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 305-318PubMed Google Scholar) and purified by nickel-agarose affinity chromatography. One aliquot of purified protein (250 μg) was phosphorylated with 100 units of recombinant, human casein kinase II (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in 7 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. Control topo II protein was incubated under similar conditions but without the addition of kinase. Separate 400-μl bed volumes of fresh nickel-agarose (Probond) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were loaded into individual minicolumns and bound with 250 μg of BSA, control topo II protein, or casein kinase II-phosphorylated topo II protein. Columns were then washed with 10 bed volumes of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl. A RIPA extract of CCRF-CEM cells (5 mg total protein) was then applied to the column, diluted 1:7 in PBS, and reapplied to the column three more times. The columns were washed extensively with 40 bed volumes of PBS, and bound proteins were eluted with multiple 500-μl aliquots of 0.5% SDS in 12.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. Aliquots of each fraction were supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol, boiled, and resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE prior to immunoblotting with a broad spectrum 14-3-3 antiserum (K-19). A modified alkaline comet assay using isolated HL-60 nuclei was performed to assess the effect of 14-3-3ε on etoposide-mediated DNA damage (39.Gieseler F. Bauer E. Nussler V. Clark M. Valsamas S. Leukemia. 1999; 13: 1859-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). HL-60 nuclei were prepared from logarithmically growing cultures by standard techniques and incubated in PBS in the presence or absence of 30 μmetoposide and GST, GST14-3-3ε, or GST14-3-3ς protein (0.16–20 μg/ml). Nuclei were incubated on ice for 90 min and then subjected to a standard electrophoretic comet protocol (40.McKelvey-Martin V.J. Green M.H. Schmezer P. Pool-Zobel B.L. De M.M. Collins A. Mutat. Res. 1993; 288: 47-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). After staining with ethidium bromide (20 μg/ml), nuclei were quantified by fluorescence microscopy for total nuclear and tail length. Oligonucleotides corresponding to residues 87–126 of pBR322, a strong topo II binding site (41.Thomsen B. Bendixen C. Lund K. Andersen A.H. Sorensen B.S. Westergaard O. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), were annealed and end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. Nuclear protein extracts (500 mm NaCl extraction) were prepared from logarithmically growing HeLa cells as described previously (16.Kroll D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and using Complete™ protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Incubations of the binding site with nuclear protein extract were carried out on ice in a 25-μl reaction volume containing 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2.5 μg of BSA, and 0.1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Free and bound oligonucleotide were separated by electrophoresis through a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× Tris borate-EDTA buffer. For competition EMSA, molar excesses of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide were premixed with the 32P-labeled binding site oligonucleotide before the addition of reaction buffer and nuclear protein extract. For supershift EMSA, antiserum was added 30 min after the initiation of the binding reaction and the mixture was incubated on ice for an additional 30 min prior to electrophoresis. DNA cleavage assays were carried out essentially as described in Ref. 42.Gantchev T.G. Hunting D.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar. Typically, reactions contained 300 ng of pBR322 and were initiated by the addition of 6 units of purified human topo IIα (Topogen, Columbus, OH) and incubated at 37 °C for 8 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS (0.5% final concentration) and incubated with proteinase K (200 μg/ml) at 56 °C for 1 h. Reaction components were resolved at 20 V for 16 h on a 1.3% agarose gel containing 0.7 μg/ml ethidium bromide to allow the relaxed closed-circular plasmid to run with greater mobility than supercoiled DNA so as to distinguish it from open, nicked-circular DNA (42.Gantchev T.G. Hunting D.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To clone and identify TIPs, a λgt11-HeLa cell cDNA library was screened with radioiodinated topo IIα-(857–1448). Four open reading frames were identified that survived three rounds of screening and plaque purification. Three clones corresponded to amino acids 280–623 of XPR1/X3, a membrane-bound receptor for xenotropic and polytropic murine leukemia viruses (43.Battini J.L. Rasko J.E. Miller A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 44.Tailor C.S. Nouri A. Lee C.G. Kozak C. Kabat D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and are not considered further here. The fourth open reading frame clone was 100% identical to the DNA sequence encoding amino acids 126–255 of the epsilon isoform of human 14-3-3 protein. To verify the authenticity of the 14-3-3ε/topo II interaction, expression vectors encoding GST in frame with the N terminus of 14-3-3ε (or fragment thereof) were generated and tested for the ability to co-precipitate topo II from solution (Fig. 1). Both the full-length GST14-3-3ε and a C-terminal fragment (amino acids 126–255) interacted with topo II-(857–1448), while GST alone did not precipitate any of the recombinant topo II peptide (Fig.1 A). Conversely, the topo II-(857–1448) fragment, containing a polyhistidine tag, was immobilized on a nickel-chelating column and was tested for the ability to adsorb endogenous 14-3-3 proteins using CCRF-CEM RIPA extract as the source. When compared with a BSA control column, the topo II column selectively co-purified a protein of 30–32 kDa that reacted with a broad spectrum antiserum to all isoforms (Fig. 1 B). Phosphorylation of the topo II-(857–1448) fragment with casein kinase II prior to immobilization on the nickel-chelating column greatly enhanced the co-purification of the 14-3-3-immunoreactive 30–32-kDa protein (Fig. 1 B), relative to either BSA or unphosphorylated topo II-(857–1448). As the above experiments were carried out using a recombinant topo II peptide, we examined whether GST14-3-3ε was able to interact with full-length 170-kDa topo II from nuclear protein extracts. Using nuclear protein extracts from CCRF/CEM cells as a source of 170-kDa topo II, we determined that GST14-3-3ε, but not GST, could interact with full-length topo II (Fig. 1 C). This association of topo II with 14-3-3 proteins does not extend to all isoforms, as no interaction was observed with a GST14-3-3ς fusion protein even though comparable amounts of protein were used (Fig. 1 C). Using an alkaline phosphatase treatment previously demonstrated to remove more than 80% of the phospholinkages on topo II (45.Kroll D.J. Rowe T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7957-7961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we demonstrated that, while the GST14-3-3ε fusion protein preferentially interacts with a phosphorylated form of topo II (Fig. 1 C), dephosphorylation abrogates the interaction. Finally, we investigated the ability of 14-3-3 antisera to co-immunoprecipitate 170-kDa topo II from CCRF-CEM cell extracts, using standard methods but with the addition of high stringency washing conditions with RIPA (instead of the low salt, detergent-lacking washes used commonly) (Fig. 1 D). Using antisera recognizing either all 14-3-3 isoforms or only the ε isoform, a topo II immunoreactive band in immunoprecipitates migrating at 170 kDa was observed when using 500 μg of cell extract. The authenticity of this interaction is emphasized by the fact that this experiment was performed without overexpression of either protein, but rather using the endogenous levels of each protein normally present in CCRF-CEM cells. Despite the fact that 14-3-3 is capable of binding several other proteins in mammalian cells, the interaction with topo II was of enough abundance to be detected in this assay. To investigate the effect of 14-3-3ε on topo II in the intact nucleus, we modified the alkaline comet assay using purified HL-60 nuclei (39.Gieseler F. Bauer E. Nussler V. Clark M. Valsamas S. Leukemia. 1999; 13: 1859-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Co-incubation of nuclei with GST14-3-3ε significantly protected the nuclei from etoposide-mediated DNA damage (Fig.2 A), while addition of GST or GST14-3-3ς provided no protection from DNA strand breakage. In the absence of etoposide-induced DNA damage, co-incubation of HL-60 nuclei with GST, GST14-3-3ε, or GST14-3-3ς had no effect on observed nuclear length (Fig. 2 A). The protection from etoposide-mediated DNA damage by GST14-3-3ε was dose-dependent with significant protection from DNA strand breaks in the presence of 0.8 μg/ml protein (Fig. 2 B). To evaluate the effect of 14-3-3ε on topo II DNA binding activity, EMSAs were carried out using a radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a strong topo II binding site. Competition EMSA, using increasing molar excesses of unlabeled oligonucleotide representing the topo II binding site and an oligonucleotide of unrelated sequence, demonstrated that the predominant observed DNA-protein interaction is sequence-specific (Fig.3 A). Addition of an anti-topo IIα antiserum produced a supershifted complex, indicating the involvement of topo II in the protein-DNA complex (Fig. 3 B). Incubation of the nuclear extract with a nonspecific antiserum produced neither a supershifted complex nor a reduction in the intensity of the specific DNA-protein complex (Fig. 3 B). GST14-3-3ε was added to the binding reaction to evaluate its effect on topo II DNA binding activity. Addition of increasing amounts of GST14-3-3ε abrogated topo II DNA binding activity (Fig. 3 C). This effect was specific for 14-3-3ε, as the addition of increasing amounts of GST alone or GST14-3-3ς had no effect on the topo II-DNA interaction (Fig. 3 C). To examine whether 14-3-3ε would alter the ability of etoposide to trap topo II in cleavable complexes, a plasmid DNA cleavage assay was performed (Fig. 4). This assay, designed to evaluate the catalytic activity of topo II, demonstrates that 14-3-3ε negatively affects the ability of etoposide to stabilize topo II in covalent complexes with DNA, as demonstrated by the reduction in intensity of the linear DNA band (Fig. 4). The inhibitory effect observed was specific for GST14-3-3ε, as neither GST alone nor GST14-3-3ς had an effect on the cleavage-religation equilibrium. Through a HeLa cDNA expression library screen, we identified 14-3-3ε as a topo II-interacting protein. We have verified the authenticity of this interaction by demonstrating that (a) recombinant GST14-3-3ε is able to interact in solution with either a recombinant topo II peptide (857–1448) or full-length topo II in nuclear protein extracts, (b) recombinant topo II-(857–1448) immobilized on a column interacts with 14-3-3 proteins in a whole cell extract, and (c) two antisera recognizing 14-3-3 proteins are able to precipitate full length topo II from cellular extract without the need for overexpression of either protein. Consistent with reports of the preferential binding of 14-3-3 to phosphorylated proteins, the interaction between 14-3-3ε and topo II is significantly enhanced by prior phosphorylation of a recombinant topo II fragment and attenuated by phosphatase pretreatment of the nuclear protein extract. It is well established that topo II, both in vitro andin vivo, is associated with and phosphorylated by casein kinase II (46.Dang Q. Alghisi G.C. Gasser S.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 10-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 47.Corbett A.H. DeVore R.F. Osheroff N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22920-22926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the precise residues phosphorylatedin vivo remain to be defined. In addition to phosphorylating topo II, casein kinase II has been demonstrated to stabilize topo II decatenation activity in a phosphorylation-independent manner (49.Redwood C. Davies S.L. Wells N.J. Fry A.M. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3635-3642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Topo II appears to be phosphorylated in a cell cycle phase-specific manner, with the highest levels present at G2/M. It has been suggested that phosphorylation of topo II may regulate the activity of this enzyme, although this remains a subject of continued scrutiny. While phosphorylation of topo II by casein kinase II has been shown to increase the intrinsic ATPase activity of the enzyme (47.Corbett A.H. DeVore R.F. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20513-20518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this has not been a consistent finding (50.Kimura K. Nozaki N. Enomoto T. Tanaka M. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21439-21445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The interpretation of these studies is complicated by the use of topo II from different species and whether or not cell cycle variations in the level of site-specific phosphorylation are taken into consideration. Although phosphorylation of its protein partner is not an absolute requirement (51.Masters S.C. Pederson K.J. Zhang L. Barbieri J.T. Fu H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5216-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), the interaction of 14-3-3 with its targets is most often mediated by the recognition of a phosphoserine motif. Two consensus sequences for 14-3-3 binding have been identified (52.Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar, 53.Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). Examination of the topo II sequence reveals a single potential 14-3-3 binding site (1080RGYDSDP1088) that also contains within it a casein kinase II consensus phosphorylation site (54.Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether this site is phosphorylated by casein kinase II or contributes to the interaction with 14-3-3ε is under investigation. To establish the functional consequences of these interactions, we have used three independent assays to evaluate the impact of 14-3-3ε on distinct topo II activities. Using both a modified alkaline comet assay with isolated HL-60 nuclei and a plasmid DNA cleavage assay, we demonstrated that 14-3-3ε negatively affects the ability of etoposide to trap topo II in cleavable complexes, thereby preventing the induction of DNA strand breaks. By EMSA, it is demonstrated that this appears to be due to reduced DNA binding activity. Whether 14-3-3ε induces a change in the preferred DNA binding sequence for topo II remains to be tested. Taken together, these findings suggest that the effect of 14-3-3ε on topo II activity be evaluated in intact cells, since the consequence of this interaction is reminiscent of topo II inhibition as a result of physical association with the tumor suppressor gene product, Rb (10.Bhat U.G. Raychaudhuri P. Beck W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7859-7864Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although an extensive range of studies investigating 14-3-3 proteins have been published, few papers characterize more than one isoform, while even fewer reports experimentally exclude specific isoforms as candidate interacting proteins. While the amino acid sequences of the seven identified 14-3-3 isoforms are highly conserved (55.Aitken A. Collinge D.B. van, H. B. Isobe T. Roseboom P.H. Rosenfeld G. Soll J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 498-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), the retention of multiple isoforms throughout evolution suggests that they may have evolved distinct, non-redundant functions. Although some proteins, such as Raf1, may be promiscuous in their association with multiple 14-3-3 isoforms (20.Freed E. Symons M. Macdonald S.G. McCormick F. Ruggieri R. Science. 1994; 265: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 22.Fantl W.J. Muslin A.J. Kikuchi A. Martin J.A. MacNicol A.M. Gross R.W. Williams L.T.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), other 14-3-3 protein partners demonstrate a degree of selectivity (31.Chan T.A. Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1999; 401: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 57.Vincenz C. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20029-20034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This report demonstrates that 14-3-3ε, but not 14-3-3ς, interacts with topo II, thereby modulating several in vitro measures of topo II function. 14-3-3ε is an atypical isoform, being more closely related to yeast and plant 14-3-3 proteins than to other mammalian isoforms (55.Aitken A. Collinge D.B. van, H. B. Isobe T. Roseboom P.H. Rosenfeld G. Soll J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 498-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 58.Skoulakis E.M. Davis R.L. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 16: 269-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This early divergence may have given rise to distinct roles for 14-3-3ε. It should be considered that the limited distribution of 14-3-3ς to cells of epithelial origin, in contrast with the ubiquitous distribution of 14-3-3ε, may also play a role in influencing their functions (19.Aitken A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 341-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 59.Roseboom P.H. Weller J.L. Babila T. Aitken A. Sellers L.A. Moffett J.R. Namboodiri M.A. Klein D.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that topo II interacts with 14-3-3ε (and 14-3-3τ), 2E. U. Kurz and D. J. Kroll, unpublished observation. but not with 14-3-3ς, it is not currently known whether topo II interacts with other 14-3-3 isoforms. There are several hypotheses as to the mechanism of 14-3-3ε-mediated disruption of topo II function. First, dimerization is essential for topo II DNA-binding and function. Recently, two sequences in human topo II (spanning amino acids 1053–1069 and 1124–1143) were identified to be crucial for this dimerization, with disruption of either sequence leading to a loss of capacity to dimerize (60.Bjergbæk L. Jensen S. Westergaard O. Andersen A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26529-26536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It is of note that the candidate 14-3-3ε binding site falls between these two sequences. Second, numerous 14-3-3 isoforms, including 14-3-3ε, have been recently described as mediating subcellular localization of their protein partners, including protein kinase Uα (36.Zhang S. Xing H. Muslin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24865-24872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and, in response to DNA damage, the cell cycle regulatory protein cdc25, thereby inducing cell cycle arrest (32.Lopez-Girona A. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Nature. 1999; 397: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 33.Yang J. Winkler K. Yoshida M. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 34.Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 35.Dalal S.N. Schweitzer C.M. Gan J. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4465-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Hypothetically, the interaction between 14-3-3ε and topo II could modulate the subcellular localization of topo II, either during phases of the cell cycle, or in response to DNA damage thereby modulating cellular sensitivity to topo II poisons. Whether the binding of 14-3-3ε disrupts topo II homodimerization, modulates topo II localization, or functions through a mechanism yet to be considered remains the focus of our ongoing investigation. In summary, we have identified 14-3-3ε as a topo II-interacting protein. Our finding that this interaction with topo II does not extend to all 14-3-3 isoforms, as demonstrated by the lack of interaction with 14-3-3ς, is one of a small, but growing, number of reports that hint at functional specificity within this well conserved protein family. This observation suggests that evolutionary retention of multiple isoforms may be attributable to hereto unappreciated distinct and non-redundant functions for individual isoforms or subsets thereof. The demonstration that 14-3-3ε disrupts topo II/DNA interaction and reduces etoposide-mediated cleavable complex formation and DNA strand breaks has significant implications for the cellular sensitivity to topo II-directed chemotherapeutics.

Aiyar A. Cobrinik D. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 33-47Google Scholar). In the case of HIV and related lentiviruses of simian, feline, and equine origin, tRNALys3 is selected as the replication primer. Early experimentation suggested complementarity between the PBS and sequences at the 3′ terminus of the replication primer as the sole specificity determinant during initiation of (−) strand synthesis (2.Taylor J.M.

In the latter case, chemical footprinting data (11.Isel C. Lanchy J.-M. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R.

The first of these is characterized by slow addition of the first 5 dNTPs, during which DNA synthesis is highly distributive; subsequently, the replication machinery moves into a rapid and processive elongation mode. Avian viruses display a similar control mechanism, although the intermolecular interactions underlying this are subtly different,i.e. while the anticodon loop of tRNALys,3 is in intimate contact with U5-IR loop bases of the HIV genome, this occurs between the TΨC arm of tRNATrp and U5-IR stem bases in Rous sarcoma virus (3.Cobrinik D. Aiyar A Ge Z. Katzman M. Huang H. Leis J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3864-3872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Aiyar A. Ge Z. Leis J. J.

Although restricted to an intracellular life cycle in the absence of an envelope gene, LTR-containing retrotransposons of the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, representatives of which include Ty1 and Ty3, share many features of the reverse transcription cycle with their retroviral counterparts (16.Boeke J. Stoye J.P. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 343-432Google Scholar). Both are LTR-containing elements requiring a host-derived tRNA primer, in this case tRNAiMet, to initiate (−) strand synthesis. In contrast, a distinguishing feature of these retrotransposons is the limited complementarity between PBS sequences at the 5′ end of the genome and the tRNA primer, which in Ty3 is reduced from 18 to 8 nt. However, Keeney et al. (17.Keeney J.B. Champan K.B. Lauermann V. Voytas D.F. Astrom S.U. von Pawel-Rammingen U. Byström A. Boeke J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) demonstrated that features of the TΨC arm are critical to transposition, and more recently Gabus et al. (18.Gabus C. Ficheux D. Rau M. Kieth G. Sandmeyer S. Darlix J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4873-4880Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) provided experimental evidence that Ty3 compensates for this by exploiting a bipartite PBS. According to this model, a region with extensive complementarity (12 nucleotides) to the TΨC arm of the tRNA primer is located at the 3′ end of the genome. Although speculative, these authors have also suggested an initiation complex of two genomic RNAs could be stabilized through a short autocomplementary sequence in tRNAiMet, which induces dimerization. A similar scenario prevails with Ty1, where reduced complementarity to the 3′ end of the tRNA primer (10 nt) is compensated by extended interactions with the D arm (19.Friant S. Heyman T. Wilhelm M.L. Wilhelm F.X. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 441-449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This notion of co-operativity between distal cis-acting sequences on the genome may be not be unique to retrotransposons. Brule et al. (20.Brulé F. Bec G. Keith G. Le Grice S.F.J. Roques B.P. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have found that (−) strand transfer in HIV can benefit from complementary sequences in the tRNA anticodon stem and bases in the U3 region at the 3′ end of the genome. A better understanding of cis-acting sequences cooperating in (−) strand DNA synthesis in retrotransposons would therefore be beneficial. As in retroviruses, (+) strand synthesis in retrotransposons initiates from an RNase H-resistant, purine-rich sequence immediately adjacent to the U3 region at the 3′ end of the genome and designated the polypurine tract or PPT. This sequence must be (i) selected from the (+) RNA/(−) DNA replication intermediate, (ii) extended at its 3′ terminus into (+) strand DNA, and (iii) excised from the nascent (+) strand to generate the appropriate 5′ LTR sequences for recognition by the integration machinery. Since imprecise removal of the PPT from (+) DNA may have consequences for integration, PPT selection and removal must by necessity be a highly accurate process. In this respect, Kirchner and Sandmeyer (21.Kirchner J. Sandmeyer S.B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4737-4747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Wilhelm et al. (22.Wilhelm M. Heyman T. Friant S. Wilhelm F.X. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2161-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) indicated that several ribonucleotides at the 3′ terminus of the Ty3 and Ty1 PPT could serve as (+) strand initiation sites. These studies have relied exclusively on analysis of DNA isolated from virus-like particles since, until recently, purified Ty3 RT and a reconstituted system recapitulating in vivo events have been unavailable. The goal of the present study was to prepare recombinant Ty3 RT and analyze both the nucleoprotein complexes and enzymatic activities (DNA polymerase and RNase H) mediating these events. DNase I footprinting of binary polymerization complexes indicates an organization unlike that demonstrated for several retroviral enzymes (23.Wohrl B.M. Georgiadis M. Telesnitsky A. Hendrickson W. Le Grice S.F.J. Science. 1995; 267: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24.Wohrl B.M. Tantillo C. Arnold E. Le Grice S.F.J.

A system of “PPT scanning” was also exploited to evaluate the precision with which Ty3 (+) strand synthesis is initiated. Surprisingly, this system indicated that the specificity of primer selection and removal was dependent on the nature of the PPT-containing RNA primer. Finally, alignment of amino acid sequences from the RNase H domains of several LTR-containing retrotransposons and plant caulimoviruses suggests an alternative distribution of catalytic residues. The 55-kDa RT open reading frame was amplified from the Ty3POL3 gene (26.Kirchner J. Sandmeyer S.B. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 19-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by the polymerase chain reaction as aBamHI/HindIII fragment and inserted between the equivalent sites of plasmid p6HRT (27.Le Grice S.F.J. Grüninger-Leitch F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 178: 307-314Crossref Scopus (299) Google Scholar). This procedure generated plasmid p6HTy3RT, which allows IPTG-inducible expression of a polyhistidine extended enzyme. RT was purified from logarithmically grown and IPTG-induced cultures by a combination of metal chelate (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose) and ion exchange chromatography (S-Sepharose). Purified enzyme was demonstrated to be free of contaminating nucleases and stored at −20 °C in a 50% glycerol-containing buffer (28.Le Grice S.F.J. Cameron C.E. Benkovic S.J. Campbell J.L. DNA Replication: Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, New York1995: 130-147Google Scholar) at a concentration of 0.25 mg/ml. Under these conditions, we observed minimal loss of DNA polymerase or RNase H activity over several months. For comparative purposes, the p66/p51 form of either FIV or HIV-1 RT was included in several experiments. Methods for preparation and purification of these enzymes have been provided elsewhere (28.Le Grice S.F.J. Cameron C.E. Benkovic S.J. Campbell J.L. DNA Replication: Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, New York1995: 130-147Google Scholar). Immunological analysis of Ty3 RT expressed in Escherichia coli was performed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the purified protein. The molecular weight and quaternary structure of Ty3 RT was evaluated by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) connected to a DuoFlow (Bio-Rad) chromatography system. For Calibration purposes, 50–250 μg of several proteins of known molecular weight were applied to the column in a buffer of 50 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.0), 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. These include human IgG (150,000 Da), HIV RT p66/p51 (117,000 Da), bovine serum albumin (67,000 Da), HIV RT p51 (52,000 Da), β-lactoglobulin (35,000 Da), and cytochrome c (12,000 Da). 62 μg of Ty3 RT was likewise applied. Elution of proteins was detected spectrophotemetrically (E 280), and migration times plotted against log molecular weight to create a molecular weight standard curve. The best fit dependence of mass on migration time was determined using the logarithmic curve-fitting function of Delta Graph graphing software (Design Sciences, Inc.). DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity was evaluated on a 71-nt template hybridized to a 5′ end-labeled 36-nt primer, the former of which contains a short stem-loop in the single stranded template (29.Wohrl B.M.

Twenty nm template-primer (annealed by incubation at 95 °C in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm MgCl2 and slow cooling to room temperature) was incubated with 40 nm RT on ice for 5 min, in a buffer comprising 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 5 mmdithiothreitol. DNA synthesis was initiated at 30 °C by addition of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and TTP to a final concentration of 100 μm. Aliquots were removed at times indicated in the text and mixed with an equal volume of 7 m urea containing 0.1% bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol. Polymerization products were resolved by high voltage denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and evaluated by autoradiography. RNase H activity was initially evaluated on a 5′ end-labeled 90-nt RNA template (prepared by in vitro transcription) hybridized to the 36-nt DNA primer used to evaluate polymerase function (30.Ghosh M. Cameron C.E. Hughes S.H. Benkovic S.J. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7068-7076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). 10 nm enzyme was incubated with 20 nmtemplate-primer in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol. Hydrolysis was initiated by addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mm and allowed to continue at 30 °C. Aliquots were again removed at times indicated in the text and processed as described above. In a minor modification to this technique, RNase H activity was also examined on the same substrate whose 3′ terminus was end-labeled with [32P]Cp and RNA ligase (New England Biolabs) under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. DNase I footprinting (24.Wohrl B.M. Tantillo C. Arnold E. Le Grice S.F.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5343-5350Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was conducted on the 71-nt template/36-nt primer described above and whose template or primer was end-labeled with γ-32P and polynucleotide kinase. End-labeling followed protocols specified by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 50 mm end-labeled template-primer was incubated with 85 nm Ty3 RT in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 6 mm MgCl2, 80 mm NaCl for 10 min at room temperature. Two units of DNase I were added, and digestion allowed to proceed for 30 s. Hydrolysis was terminated by addition of an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). Nucleic acids in the aqueous phase were recovered by ethanol precipitation; dried; resuspended in a solution of 8 m urea, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol; and fractionated by high voltage denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Hydrolysis products were visualized by autoradiography. S1 footprinting (24.Wohrl B.M. Tantillo C. Arnold E. Le Grice S.F.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5343-5350Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) required modification of the DNase I protection protocol. Following preparation of protein/nucleic acid complexes, the sample was supplemented with 40 units of S1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a concentrated S1 buffer, such that the final composition of the reaction mixture was 33 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 30 μm ZnSO4. Following 30 s of S1 treatment, hydrolysis was terminated and nucleic acids processed as described above. Under these conditions, the replication complex remains stable over the digestion period. Control S1 digests of extended substrates in the absence of RT were also prepared. Experiments evaluating Ty3 PPT utilization required a combination of both DNA polymerase and RNase H activities (31.Rausch J.W. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8602-8610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A 65-nt, chemically synthesized (−) strand DNA template (Integrated DNA Technologies) containing the PPT complement was hybridized to synthetic (+) strand RNA primers (Dharmacon Research) spanning the PPT by heating to 90 °C and slow cooling in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm MgCl2. The final concentration of all template-primer combinations following hybridization was 20 μm. These substrates were incubated at room temperature for 45 min with Ty3 RT in buffer containing (final concentration) 10 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.0; 80 mm NaCl; 6 mmMgCl2; 5 mm dithiothreitol; 1 μmtemplate-primer; 340 nm RT; 100 μm each dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and TTP; 85 nm [α-32P]dATP. After 45 min, the reactions were terminated by heating to 90 °C for 2 min, after which unincorporated radioactivity was removed by spin-column Sephadex G25 gel filtration (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The eluate was divided into equal portions to visualize nascent (+) DNA containing or lacking the RNA primer. One portion was treated with 0.3 volumes of 1 n NaOH at 65 °C to hydrolyze all RNA primers, then neutralized by adding an equivalent volume of 1n HCl. Nucleic acids were precipitated with ethanol; precipitated; dried; and resuspended in 7 m urea, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol. The remaining portion (i.e. containing RNA primers) was precipitated as described above and resuspended in the same gel loading buffer. DNA synthesis products were fractionated by high voltage denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Replacement of Mg2+ in the RNase H domain with Fe2+ and hydroxyl radical-mediated cleavage of duplex DNA followed the protocol of Goette et al. (32.Gotte M. Maier G. Gross H.J. Heumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10139-10146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Substrate was the 71-nt template/36-nt primer used to evaluate DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, the template of which was 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase according to standard protocols. Enzyme (1 μm) and template primer (50 nm) were incubated 5 min at room temperature in a buffer of 80 mmHEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl. The following reactants were subsequently pipetted onto the wall of the reaction tube: 1 μl of 50 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μl of freshly prepared H2O2, 2 μl of 2 mmFe(NH4)2(SO4)2·6H2O. Reaction vessels were carefully closed and centrifuged to initiate of Fe2+-mediated hydroxyl radical cleavage. After 5 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 40 μl of stop solution (0.1m thiourea, 10.0 mm EDTA, 0.6 mNaOAc, pH 6.2), and 1 μl of glycogen. Nucleic acids were precipitated with ethanol, collected by centrifugation, dried, and resuspended in urea-based gel loading buffer. Hydrolysis products were fractionated by high voltage denaturing gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Although most lentiviral RTs studied to date exhibit a dimeric structure of asymmetrically organized subunits, the purified MLV enzyme is a monomer. Although surprising, the possibility of a monomeric RT organization is supported by recent data with recombinant enzyme from bovine leukemia virus (33.Perach M. Hizi A. Virology. 1999; 259: 176-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which was shown by rate sedimentation analysis to migrate as a monomer in both the absence and presence of duplex DNA. Following expression and purification of Ty3 RT (Fig.1, A and B), its quaternary structure was evaluated by size exclusion chromatography. As indicated in Fig. 1 B, the Ty3 enzyme migrated slightly faster than the monomeric polyhistidine-tagged p51 subunit of HIV-1 RT (mass 52 kDa) but behind bovine serum albumin (mass 67 kDa), which is consistent with a monomeric organization. However, these results do not rule out the possibility of other RT forms are required during Ty3 replication. The ability of Ty3 RT to support processive DNA synthesis in the absence of accessory factors such as the nucleocapsid protein was initially assessed. At the same time, we also wished to determine the extent to which processivity might be influenced by temperature, since yeast strains harboring Ty elements are maintained at 30 °C and RT activity in VLPs is temperature-sensitive (34.Hansen L.J. Chalker D.L. Orlinsky K.J. Sandmeyer S.B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1414-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA synthesis was evaluated on a 71-nt DNA template/36-nt DNA primer used to characterize many of the retroviral RTs in our collection (24.Wohrl B.M. Tantillo C. Arnold E. Le Grice S.F.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5343-5350Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A fortuitous feature of this substrate is the intramolecular duplex adopted by the single-stranded template immediately ahead of the primer 3′ terminus (Fig. 2 A). This structure has been exploited to evaluate the processivity of wild type and mutant variants of HIV-1 and EIAV RT. As an example, Wöhrl et al. demonstrated that the p51 subunit of EIAV RT efficiently initiates DNA synthesis on this substrate, but fails to polymerize into the hairpin (29.Wohrl B.M. Howard K.J. Jacques P.S. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8541-8548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar phenotype was obtained with HIV-1 enzymes harboring mutations within the p66 primer grip motif (35.Ghosh M. Jacques P.S. Rodgers D. Ottmann M. Darlix J.-L. Le Grice S.F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8553-8562Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, as a preliminary characterization, the response of the Ty3 enzyme to this structure was investigated, the results of which are presented in Fig.2 (B and C). DNA polymerase activity of Ty3 RT was affected by both the template hairpin and temperature at which the assay was performed (Fig.2 B). At 37 °C, i.e. where the HIV-1 enzyme was most active, DNA-dependent DNA synthesis catalyzed by Ty3 RT stopped predominantly between positions P + 10 and P + 15, which define the base of the template hairpin (Fig. 2 A). Since DNase I and S1 footprinting experiments have verified the presence of the stem-loop (24.Wohrl B.M. Tantillo C. Arnold E. Le Grice S.F.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5343-5350Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), it appears that Ty3 RT inefficiently resolves this structure at 37 °C. Lowering the incubation temperature to 30 °C conferred on Ty3 RT the capacity to polymerize through the hairpin, although the overall level of polymerase activity was lower than that obtained with the HIV-1 enzyme. In Fig. 2 C, a time course of DNA-dependent DNA synthesis was performed with both the HIV-1 and Ty3 enzymes at 30 °C. Although it is again clear that Ty3 RT is less active than its HIV-1 counterpart, pausing between template nucleotides +10 and +15 is only observed with the latter, suggesting the Ty3 enzyme may have a more robust strand displacement activity. Enzymatic footprinting of HIV (24.Wohrl B.M. Tantillo C. Arnold E. Le Grice S.F.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5343-5350Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), EIAV (25.Rausch J.R. Wohrl B.M. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 500-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and MLV replication complexes (23.Wohrl B.M. Georgiadis M. Telesnitsky A. Hendrickson W. Le Grice S.F.J. Science. 1995; 267: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) indicates that the retroviral polymerase is in close contact with DNA from template nucleotide +7 to −24/−27 of the template-primer duplex. Since the size of the Ty3 enzyme is considerably different from those we have previously evaluated, it was of interest to determine if this resulted in an altered enzymatic footprint on the same template-primer duplex. A complete picture of the nucleoprotein complex can only be achieved by independent evaluation of resistance to the nucleases S1 and DNase I, which hydrolyze single-stranded and double-stranded DNA, respectively (Fig. 3 A). For comparison, replication complexes containing p66/p51 HIV-1 RT were evaluated in parallel. The results of S1 probing are illustrated in Fig. 3 B. Since the single-stranded template of our substrate assumes an intramolecular base paired structure (Fig. 3 A), only template nucleotides between positions +1 and +10 are revealed in Fig. 3 B(hydrolysis products in the immediate vicinity of the 5′ terminus lie outside the resolving capacity on the gel). Incubation of template-primer with the heterodimeric HIV-1 enzyme results in protection of template nucleotides between positions +1 and +7 from hydrolysis, which is in keeping with our previous findings (23.Wohrl B.M. Georgiadis M. Telesnitsky A. Hendrickson W. Le Grice S.F.J. Science. 1995; 267: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24.Wohrl B.M. Tantillo C. Arnold E. Le Grice S.F.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5343-5350Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A similar S1 hydrolysis profile was obtained with the Ty3 enzyme, suggesting that the finger subdomains of each polymerase make equivalent contact with nucleotides ahead of the DNA polymerase catalytic center. In contrast, the manner in which the HIV-1 and Ty3 enzymes contact the template-primer duplex is significantly different (Fig. 3 C). The protection pattern derived from the HIV-1 enzyme extends as far as template nucleotide −22, within which positions −19/−20 remain nuclease-accessible. In the presence of Ty3 RT, the protection pattern extends to position −24, while template nucleotides between positions −16 and −19 remain nuclease-accessible. A similar pattern emerges when contact to primer nucleotides of the template-primer duplex is investigated (Fig. 3 D). In this case, HIV-1 RT protects primer nucleotides between positions −1 and −25, within which positions −19/−20 remain accessible. With the Ty3 enzyme, the protection pattern also extends as far as primer nucleotide −25, but within this footprint positions −16 to −18 are rendered nuclease-susceptible. Combining the Ty3 RT-derived template and primer hydrolysis profiles suggests duplex DNA between positions −16 and −19 remains freely accessible to DNase I. Such data may indicate that the N-terminal DNA polymerase and C-terminal RNase H domains of Ty3 RT form independent domains separated by a small linker, as has been proposed for the murine enzyme (36.Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Alternatively, an interaction of Ty3 RT with the template-primer duplex may alter its structure sufficiently to render it locally hypersensitive to DNase I digestion.

https://openalex.org/W2089934677,"During sporulation of Bacillus subtilis, spore coat proteins encoded by cot genes are expressed in the mother cell and deposited on the forespore. Transcription of the cotB, cotC, andcotX genes by ςK RNA polymerase is activated by a small, DNA-binding protein called GerE. The promoter region of each of these genes has two GerE binding sites. 5′ deletions that eliminated the more upstream GerE site decreased expression oflacZ fused to cotB and cotX by approximately 80% and 60%, respectively but had no effect oncotC-lacZ expression. ThecotC-lacZ fusion was expressed later during sporulation than the other two fusions. Primer extension analysis confirmed that cotB mRNA increases first during sporulation, followed by cotX and cotCmRNAs over a 2-h period. In vitro transcription experiments suggest that the differential pattern of cotgene expression results from the combined action of GerE and another transcription factor, SpoIIID. A low concentration of GerE activatedcotB transcription by ςK RNA polymerase, whereas a higher concentration was needed to activate transcription ofcotX or cotC. SpoIIID at low concentration repressed cotC transcription, whereas a higher concentration only partially repressed cotX transcription and had little effect on cotB transcription. DNase I footprinting showed that SpoIIID binds strongly to two sites in thecotC promoter region, binds weakly to one site in thecotX promoter, and does not bind specifically tocotB. We propose that late in sporulation the rising level of GerE and the falling level of SpoIIID, together with the position and affinity of binding sites for these transcription factors incot gene promoters, dictates the timing and level of spore coat protein synthesis, ensuring optimal assembly of the protein shell on the forespore surface."

All members possess the conserved subunit topology of a large extracellular amino-terminal domain followed by four transmembrane domains, the third and fourth of which are separated by the cytoplasmic loop, a highly variable stretch of amino acids both in composition and length (for reviews, see Refs. 1.McGehee D.S. Role L.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 521-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 2.Bertrand D. Changeux J-P. Neuroscience. 1995; 7: 75-90Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 3.Karlin A.

Wadiche J. Dineley-Miller K. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 596-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, depending on their anatomical location, α7 nAChRs may influence neurotransmitter release and synaptic integration. In the mammalian brain, small populations (compared with predictions from α-bungarotoxin binding density) of this receptor have been functionally located to presynaptic and postsynaptic sites by recording from individual neurons under conditions of rapid drug application and removal (6.Alkondon M.

Heterologous expression of the α7 nAChR would facilitate investigations of the structure-function relationships of this receptor; however, transient transfection of neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines with α7 cDNA results in a surface receptor expression level that is below the detection limit of an125I-α-bungarotoxin binding assay. The failure to detect receptors with this assay indicates that less than 1,000 α7 nAChR toxin binding sites are on the cell surface. It is possible to select for cell clones that express abundant α7 nAChRs. There are numerous examples of surface α-bungarotoxin binding sites on cell lines that stably express the α7 nAChR cDNA as well as on primary neuronal cultures (14.Patrick J.W. Stallcup W.B. J. Biol.

The establishment of stably transfected cell lines, however, does not amend itself to mutational analysis of proteins in that rapid evaluation of mutated cDNA phenotypes is not feasible with this method. Recent work by Rakhilin et al. (23.Rakhilin S. Drisdel R.C. Sagher D. McGehee D.S. Vallejo Y. Green W.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) indicates that cells that do express surface α7 nAChRs detectable with 125I-α-bungarotoxin binding express α7 subunits in two disulfide-bonded conformations, whereas cells that do not express surface α-bungarotoxin binding sites predominantly express α7 subunits in a single disulfide-bonded conformation. Apparently, the formation of α-bungarotoxin binding sites from α7 subunits requires cellular factors that are insufficient in many clones of a cell line and types of cells. An α7–5HT3 chimeric receptor is an example of a receptor that expresses substantial surface receptors in a transient transfection experiment (48.Eisele J.L. Bertrand S. Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. Nature. 1993; 366: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The α7–5HT3 chimeric receptor forms from subunits composed of the extracellular ligand binding domain of the α7 nAChR and the four transmembrane domains and the cytoplasmic loop of the 5HT3 receptor (5HT3R). The junction between the two subunit types occurs at a shared valine residue at position 201 (48.Eisele J.L. Bertrand S. Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. Nature. 1993; 366: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), and the receptor is called the V201 chimeric receptor. The α7 nAChR and the V201 chimeric receptor provide us with tools to study the molecular basis for the differences between the surface expression level of these two receptors. We tested the hypothesis that amino acid residues within the subunits of ligand-gated ion channels function as surface expression determinants by regulating the distribution of receptors between surface and intracellular pools. We constructed a series of α7–5HT3 chimeric subunit cDNAs, expressed them in transfected cells, and measured the level of surface receptor expression with an [125I]α-bungarotoxin binding assay. This approach has identified amino acids that determine the number of α7–5HT3 chimeric surface toxin-binding receptors without a concomitant change in total number of toxin-binding receptors produced by the cell. Analogous surface expression determinants were identified in the α7 subunit that increase α7 nAChR surface expression, as measured with α-bungarotoxin binding. We have identified an additional structure-function relationship based on the amino acid sequence of ligand-gated ion channel subunits; the amino acid sequence of ligand-gated ion channel subunits regulates the number of toxin-binding receptors on the cell surface. Unless otherwise specified, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Sigma and Life Technologies, Inc. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA) and Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Rat α7 nAChR cDNA was cloned as described (5.Seguela P. Wadiche J. Dineley-Miller K. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 596-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse 5HT3A serotonergic receptor subunit cDNA was a gift from D. Julius (24.Maricq A.V. Peterson A.S. Brake A.J. Myers R.M. Julius D. Science. 1993; 254: 432-437Crossref Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Purified preparations of Torpedo californica nAChR were a kind gift of S. Pedersen (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). Cell lines were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Xenopus laevis were purchased from Nasco (Fort Atkinson, WI). α7–5HT3 chimeric subunit cDNAs were constructed by a three-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as follows. Oligonucleotide primers were designed to construct the junction between α7 nAChR and 5HT3R subunit cDNA sequences. These primers were synthesized as forward (5′–3′) and reverse (3′–5′) oligonucleotides comprised of half α7 nAchR subunit sequence and half 5HT3R subunit sequence flanking the junction between the two subunit sequences (as designed for each chimeric subunit; TableI and Fig. 2). The α7 nAChR subunit sequence was amplified with the reverse primer of this type in conjunction with an α7 nAChR-specific forward primer (Table I). 5HT3R subunit sequence was amplified with the forward version of the chimeric primer in partnership with a 5HT3R subunit-specific reverse primer (Table I). The amplicons from these two PCRs were purified and placed into a third PCR in order to amplify the chimeric sequence between the α7 nAChR-specific and 5HT3R-specific oligonucleotides; the amplicons purified from the previous PCR served as template, and the forward α7 nAChR-specific and the reverse 5HT3R-specific oligonucleotides amplify the chimeric sequence. This is possible because the PCR products from the previous reaction contain overlapping sequence (generated during the first PCR) and therefore can anneal and prime for cDNA synthesis. The latest amplicon was digested withSacI and Bsu36I restriction enzymes and ligated with a similarly digested and dephosphorylated (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) α7-5HT3 chimeric subunit cDNA in an eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNAI/Amp (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).Table IPCR primers for chimera subunit constructionPrimer nameNucleotide rangeSequenceα7-specific5′-3′410–429GAGCGCTTTGATGCCACGTT3′-5′1109–1126CTGACAAGCTGGCCGCAC5HT3-specific3′-5′1297–1320GGCCTCCCTTGGTGGTGGV201 chimera5′-3′α7: 703–724; 5HT3: 781–795CCCAGATGTCACCTACACAGTAATCATCCGCCGGAGG3′-5′α7: 703–724; 5HT3: 781–795CCTCCGGCGGATGATTACTGTGTAGGTGACATCTGGGL208 chimera5′-3′α7: 725–745; 5HT3: 802–825ACCATGCGCCGTAGGACACTCTTCTATGCAGTCAGCCTCTTGCTGL212 chimera5′-3′α7: 732–757; 5HT3: 814–836GCCGTAGGACACTCTACTATGGCCTCAGCCTCTTGCTGCCCAGTATCTTI216 chimera5′-3′α7: 743–769; 5HT3: 826–850CTCTACTATGGCCTCAATCTGCTCATCCCCAGTATCTTCCTCATGGTCGTGV219 chimera5′-3′α7: 755–778; 5HT3: 835–856CCTCAATCTGCTCATCCCTTGTGTATTCCTCATGGTCGTGGACATTGA223 chimera5′-3′α7: 766–790; 5HT3: 847–867CATCCCTTGTGTACTCATTTCAGCCGTGGACATTGTGGGCTTTTGCL231 chimera5′-3′α7: 792–814; 5HT3: 871–888TGGCTCTGCTGGTATTCTTGCTGCCCCCGGACAGTGGTGAGS235 chimera5′-3′α7: 803–826; 5HT3: 883–909GTATTCTTGCTGCCTGCAGACTCTGGTGAGAGAGTCTCTTTCAAGATCACAL241 chimera5′-3′α7: 818–844; 5HT3: 901–927GCAGACTCTGGAGAGAAAATCTCTCTTAAGATCACACTCCTTCTGGGATACTCAP267 chimera5′-3′α7: 903–925; 5HT3: 979–1004CAGCAACATCTGATTCTGTGCCCCTCATTGGTGTCTACTTTGTGGTGTGV271 chimera5′-3′α7: 965–988; 5HT3: 1045–1064GGCCTCTCTGTAGTGGTGACAGTGATTGTGCGGCTGGTGCATAA5HT3 TMD15′-3′α7: 687–721, 5HT3: 778–809AAAGAGCCATACCCAGATGTCACCTACACAGTGATCATCCGCCGGAGGCCTTT- ATTCTATGC3′-5′α7: 827–856, 5HT3: 859–882“GACAGTCAGAGAAAGTAAGACAGTTATTCCAAGAGAGATTTTCTCTCCACTGT- CCGGGGGCAGGCAAAAGCCShown are the primer sequences (direction is indicated in the primer name) and the position within the cDNA that the primers represent.

A chimeric subunit cDNA was constructed in which the first transmembrane domain (transmembrane domain I, amino acid residues 201–235) of the α7 nAChR was replaced with homologous sequence from the 5HT3R. This was achieved using a three-step PCR similar to that described above. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using PCR techniques. A three-step PCR protocol was utilized. Mirror image forward and reverse oligonucleotides were designed to contain a mutation of choice (Table II). The forward mutagenizing primer was coupled with the above-mentioned 5HT3R-specific reverse primer in a PCR using the appropriate α7–5HT3chimeric subunit cDNA as template. Similarly, the reverse mutagenizing primer was coupled with the α7 nAChR-specific oligonucleotide in a PCR with the same α7–5HT3 chimeric template. Each of the mutant amplicons was purified and mixed in a PCR with the forward and reverse primers specific for the α7 nAChR and 5HT3R subunit cDNAs, respectively. The purified product from this amplification was digested with SacI andBsu36I restriction enzymes and then ligated with similarly digested and dephosphorylated α7–5HT3 chimeric subunit cDNA.Table IIPCR primers for site-directed mutagenesisPrimer nameNucleotide position(s) mutatedSequenceα7, V219 T202IC726TACCTACACAGTAATCATGCGCCGTα7, V218 M203IG730CACAGTAACCATCCGCCGTAGGα7, V219 T207PA740C, A742TGCGCCGTAGGCCTCTCTACTATV201 I202TT782ATACACAGTAACCATCCGCCGGV201 I203MC786GACAGTAATCATGCGCCGGAGGV201 P207TC796A, T798ACGCCGGAGGACATTATTCTATα7 C218ST773ACTCATCCCTAGTGTACTCATTTCAGCCα7 V219IG776A, A778CCTCATCCCTTGTATCCTCATTTCAGV219 C218ST773ACTCATCCCTAGTGTATTCCTCATGGTCV219 V219IG776A, A778CCTCATCCCTTGTATCTTCCTCATGGTV201 S218CA773TTTGCTGCCCTGTATCTTCCTCATV201 I219VA776G, C778ATTGCTGCCCAGTGTATTCCTCATThe chosen mutation is listed, and the sequence of the mutagenizing primer is shown with the targeted nucleotide(s) underlined.

FLAG epitope-tagged 5HT3R (5HT3-FLAG) subunit cDNA in the pcDNAI/Neo (Invitrogen) was a gift from P. Seguela (McGill University, Montreal, Canada). This construct was described previously (5.Seguela P. Wadiche J. Dineley-Miller K. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 596-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The subunit cDNA was subcloned into pcDNAI/Amp at HindIII and XbaI restriction sites. A FLAG epitope-tagged V201 chimeric cDNA was generated by subcloning. The sequence of all mutated cDNA constructs was verified by dideoxy sequencing (26.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52743) Google Scholar) as performed by SeqWright (Houston, TX). COS cells were transfected with receptor subunit cDNA by the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (27.Gu Y. Forsayeth J.R. Verrall S., Yu, X.M. Hall Z.W. Neuron. 1990; 5: 147-157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28.Chen D. Patrick J.W. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 106 cells/150-mm culture dish were transfected with 5 μg of the appropriate cDNA in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% antibiotics, 1% fetal bovine serum, 100 μm chloroquine disulfate, 0.04% DEAE-dextran. Following 4 h of incubation, cells were treated for 2 min with 10% Me2SO in PBS followed by transfer to complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% antibiotics). Twenty-four h following transfection, cells were trypsinized, counted, and plated to 24-well dishes coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma, M r > 300,000) at 25,000 cells per well. Receptor expression was assayed 24 h later. Adenoviral transfection was performed according to a modified version of Cristiano et al. (29.Christiano R.J. Smith L.C. Kay M.A. Brinkley B.R. Woo S.L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11548-11552Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Briefly, complexed adenovirus, plasmid cDNA, and poly(l-lysine) in PBS were incubated for a total of 40 min at room temperature. The mixture was added to wells of a 48-well plate containing 25,000 SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells per well in a total volume of 400 μl of complete medium. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2, the transfection mixture was aspirated and replaced with complete medium. Cells were assayed 48 h later. Surface receptors were assayed by binding 125I-α-bungarotoxin. Transfected cells were rinsed twice with PBS and then preincubated in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin with (nonspecific binding samples, in triplicate) or without (total binding samples, in triplicate) 10 μm cobratoxin for 30 min at room temperature. This incubation was followed by the addition of125I-α-bungarotoxin (NEN Life Science Products) to 5 nm and incubation for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were rinsed four times with 1 ml of PBS and dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.1n NaOH, and isotope was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Toxin binding dose-response data were generated by performing125I-α-bungarotoxin binding using concentrations of toxin ranging from 0.1 to 10 nm as described above. Total receptors were measured under the same conditions as above, except binding was performed in solubilization buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA/EGTA, 1% Triton X-100), and toxin-bound cell lysates were rinsed over filters. GFC filters (Whatman) pretreated in 3% polyethylenimine, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, followed by 2% bovine serum albumin block in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, were used. Filters were rinsed four times with 4 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin. After drying, filters were treated with 1 ml of Soluene (Packard) for 30 min at 60 °C and then liquid scintillation-counted in the presence of 7 ml of Ultima Gold (Packard). COS cells transfected with FLAG epitope-tagged V201 chimeric or 5HT3R subunit cDNA were rinsed twice with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed twice in PBS and blocked in 6% casein in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. Mouse anti-FLAG antibody (Research Diagnostics Inc., Flanders, NJ) was diluted to 10 μg/ml in blocking solution and incubated with cells for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed three times with PBS. Biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) was diluted to 5 μg/ml in blocking solution and incubated with cells at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were rinsed three times in PBS. Cells were then incubated with 0.63 pm125I-Streptavidin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at room temperature. After rinsing three times with PBS, cells were solubilized in 0.1n NaOH and liquid scintillation-counted. Nonspecific binding was determined as above, except the primary antibody was omitted. α-Bungarotoxin binding proteins were purified using α-cobratoxin affinity resin according to the method of Kemp et al. (30.Kemp G. Bentley L. McNamee M.G. Morley B.J. Brain Res. 1985; 347: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected COS cells were rinsed with PBS and then harvested by scraping in PBS containing Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and then resuspended in solubilization buffer containing Complete protease inhibitor. Cell lysate was rocked at 4 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 ×g. The supernatant was collected and mixed overnight at 4 °C with agarose-conjugated cobratoxin (Sigma) equilibrated with solubilization buffer. The cobratoxin resin was rinsed four times with solubilization buffer, and toxin receptors were eluted with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (300 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 30% glycerol, 8% SDS, 1 murea, 1 m dithiothreitol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol). Samples were resolved with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4% stacking, 8% separating gels) transferred to Immobilon membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and immunodetected with antibodies specific for the extracellular domain of the α7 nAChR subunit (31.Chen D. Patrick J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24024-24029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 32.Neff S. Dineley-Miller K. Char D. Quik M. Patrick J. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). All antibodies were diluted in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dry milk. Blots were rinsed in PBS and 0.1% Tween 20. One to 200 ng of bacterial recombinant protein encoding the α7 nAChR extracellular domain was applied to each gel in order to generate a standard curve and quantify toxin-purified protein. Rainbow molecular weight markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were loaded to each gel to estimate the molecular weight of protein samples. Immunoreactivity was visualized with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Cappel Organon Teknika, West Chester, PA) followed by ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and film exposure (Eastman Kodak Co.). Purified receptor bands on exposed film were quantified with densitometry analysis (NIH Image; National Institutes of Health) in comparison with an α7 nAChR recombinant protein standard curve. Lysates of approximately 1 × 107 cells were prepared as above, preincubated with 20 nm125I-α-bungarotoxin, and applied to a 5–20% linear sucrose gradient prepared in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100. Gradient and loaded sample were sedimented at 60,000 rpm (SW 60; Beckman Corp., Palo Alto, CA), 4.5 h at 4 °C. An aliquot of purified T. californica nAChR preincubated with 20 nm125I-α-bungarotoxin was run in parallel as a standard for toxin-bound pentameric and dipentameric receptor. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the centrifuge tube. Odd numbered fractions were assayed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting, and even numbered fractions were resolved with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunodetected as described. Oocytes were prepared, injected, and recorded according to Chen and Patrick (28.Chen D. Patrick J.W. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Currents induced by 3 s of agonist application (300 μm nicotine) were recorded. The V201 chimera served as a control, and the oocytes injected with the V201 chimera subunit cDNA had currents of 300 nA or greater when agonist was applied. Recorded currents were filtered at 300 Hz using an eight-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA). Data were acquired and analyzed using Axodata, Axograph (Axon Instruments), and Igor (Wave Mechanics) software on an Apple Macintosh IIci computer. For much of the data to be described,125I-α-bungarotoxin binding was utilized to quantify receptor expression level. Because the ligand binding domain of the chimeric receptor is contributed by the α7 subunit and α7 nAChRs and V201 chimeric receptors exhibit equivalent affinity for α-bungarotoxin (33.Corringer P.J. Bertrand S. Bohler S. Edelstein S.J. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 18: 648-657Crossref Google Scholar), iodinated α-bungarotoxin is a quantitative label for both α7 nAChRs and α7–5HT3 chimeric receptors. Thus, the term “receptor” is defined as an α-bungarotoxin binding site and “expression level” refers to the number of toxin binding sites produced by a cell. We evaluated the surface expression levels of the V201 chimeric receptor, the 5HT3R, and the α7 nAChR. COS cells were transfected with α7 nAChR or V201 chimeric subunit cDNAs, and surface receptor expression was quantified 2 days post-transfection. α7 nAChR surface expression is below the detection limit of a125I-α-bungarotoxin binding assay (Fig.1 A). In contrast, cells transfected with the V201 chimeric subunit cDNA express tens of thousands of surface toxin binding sites (Fig. 1 A). These results demonstrate again that the V201 α7–5HT3 chimeric receptor expresses many more toxin binding sites on the cell surface than the α7 nAChR. We then determined whether the high surface expression level of the V201 chimera reflects a property of wild type 5HT3R's or is unique to the chimera. We compared the surface expression level of wild type 5HT3R with that of the V201 chimeric receptor. The 3′-end of each subunit cDNA was tagged with a sequence encoding the FLAG peptide, and surface receptor expression was measured on transfected cells with a FLAG antibody-125I-streptavidin binding assay. Surface receptor expression levels were equivalent for the 5HT3R and the V201 chimeric receptor, indicating that the surface expression phenotype of the V201 chimera is conferred by 5HT3 sequence (Fig. 1 B). Based on the subunit sequence of the V201 chimera, 5HT3R surface expression determinants are contained within amino acids 201–449 of the subunit. We measured total α7 nAChR expression and total V201 chimeric receptor expression to determine whether the number of surface receptors is simply a result of higher levels of expression of the V201 chimeric receptor. Cells expressing the V201 receptor express approximately 3.5 times more toxin binding sites than cells expressing the α7 nAChR. 65,000 ± 15,000 toxin binding sites are detected in extracts of cells transfected with α7 cDNA (n= 30), while extracts of cells expressing the V201 chimeric receptor contain 224,000 ± 23,000 toxin binding sites per cell (n = 41; Fig. 1 C). Less than 1% of α7 nAChRs expressed are on the cell surface, whereas 30% of V201 chimeric receptors are surface receptors (Fig. 1 D). This 30-fold difference demonstrates that the number of surface toxin binding sites produced by the α7 nAChR and the V201 chimeric receptor does not simply result from greater V201 chimeric receptor production. These results indicate that the mechanism underlying the different surface expression levels of these two receptors lies downstream of receptor assembly and processing events that produce a toxin binding site. We propose that the differential surface expression of the two receptor types is determined by the amino acid sequence of their subunits. To state it another way, sequence differences carboxyl-terminal to residue 201 between α7 and V201 chimeric subunits underlie the surface expression differences observed for these receptors. We tested the idea that subunit sequence determines the level of surface receptor expression by identifying amino acids in α7–5HT3 chimeric receptor subunits that act as surface expression determinants. Initially we mapped the 5HT3portion of the V201 chimera necessary for surface receptor expression. Chimeric subunit cDNAs were engineered in which the junction between α7 and 5HT3 sequence moved progressively toward the 3′-end of the cDNA. Based on secondary structure analysis (34.Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 222-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar), the junction between α7 and 5HT3 amino acid sequence for each of these chimeric"

The His6-tagged protein was fully functional in in vitro and in vivo biotin production assays. Analysis of all the publishedbioB sequences identified a number of conserved residues. Single point mutations, to either serine or threonine, were carried out on the four conserved (Cys-53, Cys-57, Cys-60, and Cys-188) and one non-conserved (Cys-288) cysteine residues, and the purified mutant proteins were tested both for ability to reconstitute the [2Fe-2S] clusters of the native (oxidized) dimer and enzymatic activity. The C188S mutant was insoluble. The wild-type and four of the mutant proteins were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, metal and sulfide analysis, and both in vitro and in vivobiotin production assays. The molecular masses of all proteins were verified using electrospray mass spectrometry. The results indicate that the His6 tag and the C288T mutation have no effect on the activity of biotin synthase when compared with the wild-type protein. The C53S, C57S, and C60S mutant proteins, both as prepared and reconstituted, were unable to covert dethiobiotin to biotin in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that three of the conserved cysteine residues (Cys-53, Cys-57, and Cys-60), all of which lie in the highly conserved “cysteine box” motif, are crucial for [Fe-S] cluster binding, whereas Cys-188 plays a hitherto unknown structural role in biotin synthase.

However, the mechanism of the final step, the conversion of dethiobiotin to biotin catalyzed by biotin synthase (see SchemeFS1), remains unresolved. Numerous studies have shown that a fully functional in vitrosystem for conversion of dethiobiotin to biotin requires not only the product of the bioB gene but also several other proteins and low molecular weight molecules. Although the exact components of this system vary between different laboratories,S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet),1 NADPH, cysteine, DTT, Fe2+, and a reducing system (5.Sanyal I. Gibson K.J. Flint D.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) are common to all. The reducing system we and others use consists of flavodoxin (FLD) (6.Ifuku O. Koga N. Haze S. Kishimoto J. Wachi Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and flavodoxin (ferredoxin) NADP+ oxidoreductase (FLDR) (7.Birch O.M. Fuhrmann M. Shaw N.M. J.

Commun. 1995; 217: 1231-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) have found can be replaced by a photoreduced deazaflavin. Both systems appear to be equally effective in providing reducing equivalents for the reaction. There is, however, conflicting evidence that other proteins, cofactors, and allosteric activators may also be required for competence of the biotin synthase complex. There is no doubt that addition of extracts derived from E. coli bioB − strains can enhance activity of biotin synthase, but whether this is due to the presence of a thiamine pyrophosphate-stabilized protein (7.Birch O.M. Fuhrmann M. Shaw N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19158-19165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), high levels of constitutive low molecular weight cellular components such as fructose 1,6-biphosphate and the labile (and as yet uncharacterized) AdoMet-derived product of the 7,8-diaminononanoate synthase reaction (5.Sanyal I. Gibson K.J. Flint D.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), or indeed to a combination of several of these factors is still open to question. Recent results indicate that the sulfur incorporated in the tetrahydrothiophene ring of biotin is ultimately derived from cysteine (7.Birch O.M. Fuhrmann M. Shaw N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19158-19165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and that 9-mercaptodethiobiotin (but not 6-mercaptodethiobiotin) can act as an intermediate (9.Baxter R.L. Camp D.J. Cotts A. Shaw N. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1992; 1: 255-258Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The intermediacy of 9-mercaptodethiobiotin, racemization at C-9 (10.Marti F.B.

Tetrahedron Lett. 1980; 21: 4783-4786Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar)), and the requirement for at least two molecules of AdoMet for each ring formation step provides clues to the mechanism of C–S bond formation (12.Guianvarc'h D.

Taken together these results suggest that the mechanism involves the following: (a) initial AdoMet-dependent radical formation at C-9; (b) capture of sulfur by the C-9 radical to form a 9-mercaptodethiobiotin derivative; and (c) a second AdoMet-initiated radical formation by abstraction of the pro-S hydrogen at C-6 to generate a conformationally restrained radical that subsequently captures the C-9 thiol resulting in tetrahydrothiophene ring closure (13.Marquet A. Florentin D. Ploux O. Tse Sum Bui B. J. Phys. Org. Chem. 1998; 11: 529-535Crossref Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that a sulfur atom of the [Fe-S] cluster of biotin synthase, rather than cysteine itself, may act as the actual sulfur donor, suggesting that the [Fe-S] cluster of the enzyme must be regenerated prior to the next reaction (14.Tse Sum Bui B. Florentin D. Fournier F. Ploux O. Méjean A. Marquet A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus biotin synthase could be regarded as both a reagent and a catalyst. It has been suggested that a NifS-like enzyme, similar to the Azotobacter vinelandii NifS (15.Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V. Dean D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), may be required for construction of the [Fe-S] cluster in vivoand regeneration in vitro but such an activity has still to be identified. NifS is a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the desulfuration of l-cysteine to yield l-alanine and sulfide that has been shown to catalyze [Fe-S] cluster formation in vitro and in vivo. The fact that E. coli biotin synthase is based on a core [2Fe-2S] protein with a requirement for a FLD/FLDR redox couple and AdoMet as a radical generator suggests that it belongs to the family of enzymes that include anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase-activating enzyme (ARR-AE) (16.Mulliez E. Fontecave M. Gaillard J. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2296-2299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), pyruvate formate-lyase-activating enzyme (PFL-AE) (17.Broderick J.B. Duderstadt R.E. Fernandez D.C. Wojtuszewski K. Henshaw T.F. Johnson M.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 7396-7397Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar), lysine 2,3-aminomutase (LAM) (18.Leider K.W. Booker S. Ruzicka F.J. Beinert H. Reed G.H. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2578-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and lipoic acid synthase (LIPA) (19.Ollangier-de Choudons S. Fontecave M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Even within this small group there already appears to be differences with regard to subunit composition and chemical function; biotin synthase, LIPA, and ARR-AE are dimers; LAM is a hexamer, and PFL-AE is a monomer. Biotin synthase, LIPA, and LAM generate a radical on a small molecule, whereas ARR-AE and PFL-AE generate a protein glycyl radical. Characterization of the E. coli biotin synthase has been complicated by the fact that most preparations of the protein contain variable amounts of polymeric forms (mainly dimers and tetramers) with variable [Fe-S] content. The major native form of the core biotin synthase, however, appears to be a 76-kDa dimer, each monomer containing an [2Fe-2S] cluster (20.Sanyal I. Cohen G. Flint D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3625-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Spectroscopic studies suggest that reduction of the two [2Fe-2S] clusters in the oxidized protein dimer, an obligatory step in the mechanism, results in formation of a biotin synthase dimer containing a single [4Fe-4S] cluster in which each of the iron centers is coordinated to a thiol ligand(s) of the protein (21.Duin E.C. Lafferty M.E. Crouse B.R. Allen R.M. Sanyal I. Flint D.H. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11811-11820Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 22.Johnson M.K. Staples C.R. Duin E.C.

Biol. 1999; 3: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, almost nothing is known about the protein residues involved in coordination to the [Fe-S] clusters of biotin synthase. Whereas the active sites have been proposed to involve the cysteine thiols of the common GXCXXXCXXCXQ motif as a “cysteine ([Fe-S] coordination) box” motif, there has been as yet no experimental evidence to support this contention (20.Sanyal I. Cohen G. Flint D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3625-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In this paper we describe studies on mutants of the biotin synthase protein that uniquely identify the key protein cysteine residues involved in formation of the [Fe-S] cluster. Electrophoresis was carried out using a Bio-Rad Protean II minigel system (protein) and a Life Technologies, Inc., H5 system (DNA). PCR and sequencing reactions were done on a Perkin-Elmer 480 thermal cycler, and automated DNA sequencing was carried out using an ABI prism 377 DNA sequencer. An Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC system and columns were used for chromatographic separations of proteins. Electrospray mass spectrometry was performed on a Micromass Platform II quadrupole mass spectrometer. UV-visible spectrophotometry was done on a Unicam UV4. Determination of metal ion concentrations were carried out using a Thermo Jarrell Ash IRIS inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer. Primers were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and Ready to Go PCRTM beads from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Pre-cast SDS-PAGE gels (10% Bis-Tris) were purchased from Novex and were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The E. coli strain Top 10 One ShotTM cells (F′mcrA D(mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC) F80lacZDM15 DlacX74 deoR recA1 araD139 Δ(ara-leu)7697 galU galKrpsL endA1 nupG, Invitrogen) were used for the maintenance of plasmids and also for the initial transformation of ligation products. HMS174 (DE3) cells (F- recAhsdR(rK12−mK12+) Rifr (DE3), Novagen) were used for the overexpression of genes cloned into pET plasmids. PCOi (bio−Δ(attλ, bio uvrB) thr, leu, thi, placi) was used to prepare a biotin minus cell-free extract. The biotin auxotrophLactobacillus plantarum (ATCC 8014) was used in the microbial biotin assay (24.DeMoll E. Shive W. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 158: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A 1041-base pairNcoI/BamHI fragment from pB030 (a gift from Lonza AG) containing the bioB gene was cloned into the same sites of pET16b (Novagen), and the resultant plasmid was called pET16b/bioB. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the “mega-primer” PCR method using vector forward (BIOB PCR) and reverse (M13) oligonucleotides and the mutagenic primers (C53S, C57S, C60S, C188S and C288T) (25.Sarker G. Sommers S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). The typical PCR reaction volume was 50 μl and consisted of template DNA (1 μl), forward primer (1 μm), reverse primer (1 μm), water (39 μl), and two Taq beads. The primers for the cysteine mutations used were C53S (5′ AAG ACC GGA GCT TCC CCG GAA GAT 3′), C57S (5′ CCG GAA GAT TCT AAA TAC TGC CCG 3′), C60S (5′ AAA TAC TCT CCG CAA ACG TCG CGC 3′), C188S (5′ GGG ATC AAA GTC TCT TCT GGC 3′), and C288T (5′ GGT CAG CAG TTT GGT ACC GTA 3′). The bases underlined in each primer indicate the position where the cysteine codon is replaced by one encoding a serine or in the case of C288T a threonine. The bases in bold indicate a KpnI restriction site. All clones were sequenced, and the data were analyzed using ABI Prism editview software. Wild-type biotin synthase, His6-tagged biotin synthase (from HMS174 (DE3)/pET16b/bioB and pET6H/bioB), and mutant proteins (from HMS174 (DE3)/pHC53S, pHC57S, pHC60S, pHC188S, and pHC288T) were prepared from cultures grown in 2–10 liters of 2YT media (tryptone (16 g/liter), yeast extract (10 g/liter), sodium chloride (5 g/liter), pH 7.5) containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Transformed cells were grown at 37 °C (shaking 250 rpm) until the A 600 nm = 1.0 and biotin synthase was produced by addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells (∼2.5 g/liter wet weight) were harvested (5,000 × g for 20 min, 4 °C) after a further 4 h of growth. The cells pellets were washed by resuspension in ice-cold buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m sodium chloride, 5 mm imidazole). All other cell pellets were washed in buffer B (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5). The cell pellets were lysed by intermittent sonication (30 s on, 30 s off) 4 °C for 15 min. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 30 min, 4 °C), and the supernatants were stored frozen (−20 °C) in glycerol (15%). The PCOi (bioB−) strain was grown in 2YT, and the cells washed with buffer A and cell extracts, used for augmentation in the in vitro assay, were prepared in a similar fashion to that described above. Protamine sulfate (1%, 0.5 ml per 10 ml) was added to the cell-free extract to remove nucleic acids. After ammonium sulfate (45%) precipitation, precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer B, and filtered (0.45 μm) prior to being loaded onto a Q-Sepharose 26/10 high load anion exchange column (2.5 × 10 cm) which had been equilibrated with buffer B. The proteins were eluted with an increasing gradient of potassium chloride (0–1 M, 20 CV) in buffer B. The deep red fractions containing biotin synthase eluted at 300 mm salt. These were combined, brought to a final concentration of 10% ammonium sulfate, and loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose hydrophobic interaction column (1 × 30 cm) that had been equilibrated with buffer B containing ammonium sulfate (10%). Biotin synthase was eluted with a decreasing gradient of buffer B containing ammonium sulfate (10–0%, 20 CV). Biotin synthase eluted at the end of the gradient, and these fractions were combined and filtration concentrated (Amicon PM10 membrane). The protein was purified by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 HR eluting with buffer B. Protein samples were diluted with glycerol (15%) and stored (−80 °C). Cell-free extracts were loaded directly onto a Hi-TrapTM-chelating column (5 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been charged with NiSO4 (100 mm) and prewashed with buffer A. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of (5 mm to 1 m) imidazole in buffer A. Biotin synthase-containing fractions typically eluted between 120 and 150 mm imidazole. These were combined and exhaustively dialyzed against buffer B to remove imidazole and nickel salts and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The purity and integrity of wild-type, His6-tagged, and mutant biotin synthase forms were assessed by SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry, and UV-visible spectrophotometry. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a reference (26.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216068) Google Scholar) and by spectrophotometry using reported extinction coefficients (ε274 nm = 3.3 × 104m−1 cm−1, ε330 nm= 1.4 × 104m−1cm−1, ε420 nm = 6.0 × 103m−1 cm−1, ε453 nm= 7.1 × 103m−1cm−1, ε540 nm = 3.5 × 103m−1 cm−1) (20.Sanyal I. Cohen G. Flint D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3625-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Prior to mass spectrometry all protein samples were passed through an Aquapure reverse phase C-4 column at a constant trifluoroacetic acid concentration of 0.1% using a linear gradient of 10–100% acetonitrile in water over 40 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and the separation monitored at 280 nm. The total ion count of all the ions in the m/z range 500–2,000 was recorded. The mass spectrometer was scanned at intervals of 0.1 s, the scans accumulated, spectra combined, and the average molecular mass determined using MaxEnt and Transform algorithms of MassLynx software. Swiss-Prot and the Genomes Representation Organization data bases were used to search for amino acid sequences that were then aligned using Expasy, Clustal W, and Alscript (27.Barton G.J. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). This was carried out using methods previously described (14.Tse Sum Bui B. Florentin D. Fournier F. Ploux O. Méjean A. Marquet A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20.Sanyal I. Cohen G. Flint D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3625-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In vitrobiotin production was determined using the Lactobacillus assay (24.DeMoll E. Shive W. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 158: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Incubations were carried out both aerobically and anaerobically in buffer B. A typical assay mixture contained biotin synthase or mutant protein (5 μm), potassium chloride (10 mm), dethiobiotin (50 μm), AdoMet (150 μm), Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 (5 mm), NADPH (1 mm), fructose 1,6-biphosphate (5 mm), l-cysteine (500 μm), DTT (10 mm), PCOi cell-free extract (100 μl), FLD (12.5 μm), and FLDR (2 μm). The final reaction volume was typically 1 ml. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and then stopped by adding 100 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The resulting precipitate was centrifuged, and 5 μl of the supernatant was used for bioassay. Transformants of HMS174 (DE3) with pET16b, pET6H, pET16b/bioB, pET6H/bioB, pHC53S, pHC57S, pHC60S, pHC188S, and pHC288T were grown in M9CA media containing dethiobiotin (5 μg/ml), glucose (0.4%), thiamine (0.8 μg/ml), MgSO4 (2 mm), CaCl2 (0.1 mm), and ampicillin (100 μg/ml). AtA 600 nm = 1.0 the cells were equally divided, and one sample was kept as a control and the other was induced with IPTG (1 mm). Aliquots (1 ml) of cells were removed from both control and induced samples at various time intervals. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and 5 μl of the supernatants were used in the bioassay as above. Supernatant from HMS174 (DE3) cells were grown in the same media minus ampicillin and used as the control. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) was used for metal analyses. All data were interpreted using thermospec/CID software. The radiofrequency power was 1150 watts, the nebulizer flow was 30 pounds/square inch, the pump rate was 100 rpm, and the purge time was 90 s. Fe(NO3)3 (0.01–100 ppm; 180 nmto 1.8 mm) and Ni(NO3)2(0.0001–1.0 ppm; 1.7 nm to 17 mm) solutions were used as standards. All biotin synthase samples (27 μm) and standard solutions were made up in buffer B (28.Harris D.C. Quantitative Chemical Analysis. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1948: 513-532Google Scholar). Chemical analysis for iron was carried out using the ferrozine assay as described by Stookey (29.Stookey L.L. Anal. Chem. 1970; 42: 779-781Crossref Scopus (3589) Google Scholar) using the standard described above. Labile sulfide analysis was determined as previously reported (20.Sanyal I. Cohen G. Flint D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3625-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To study the molecular properties of wild-type and mutant forms of biotin synthase, we overproduced the protein using the pET system. In our hands we found the purification procedure described by Sanyal et al. (20.Sanyal I. Cohen G. Flint D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3625-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) both technically difficult and time-consuming, although the procedure provided ∼80% pure biotin synthase. We found it impossible to reproduce the purification of biotin synthase using a cobalt column, as described by Marquet and co-workers (30.Tse Sum Bui B. Marquet A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 279: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To overcome these problems, we decided to express the protein with an N-terminal polyhistidine tag. The bioB gene was cloned into pET6H which fused the 5′ terminus of the gene to a sequence encoding a MHHHHHHA tag. Overexpression of His6-tagged biotin synthase was carried out in HMS174 (DE3) and gave comparable expression levels when compared with wild-type biotin synthase. Optimal yields of both proteins were obtained by aerobic cell growth in 2YT at 37 °C. By using the IMAC purification system, we were able to routinely prepare 100-mg quantities of >95% pure His6-tagged biotin synthase from 5 liters of transformed cell culture. Spectroscopic studies on biotin synthase, PFL activase, and LIPA (17.Broderick J.B. Duderstadt R.E. Fernandez D.C. Wojtuszewski K. Henshaw T.F. Johnson M.K. J. Am. Chem.

Soc. 1999; 121: 4706-4707Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar) suggest that three cysteine residues from each monomer are required to coordinate the iron in the [2Fe-2S] clusters of the oxidized dimer and that two of these are required ligands in the reduced catalytically active form. Five cysteine residues of biotin synthase (Cys-53, Cys-57, Cys-60, Cys-188, and Cys-288) were replaced separately with serine or threonine residues by site-directed mutagenesis (threonine was chosen as a replacement for Cys-288 since it enabled us to engineer aKpnI restriction site into the bioB gene to facilitate mutant selection). Each of the mutant proteins was overproduced in E. coli HMS174 (DE3), and its catalytic activity was determined. Since the His6-tagged biotin synthase showed identical in vitro spectroscopic parameters and catalytic activity to wild-type protein, the mutant bioBgenes were also expressed as histidine fusion proteins. Each of the mutant proteins was purified using IMAC under identical conditions to the histidine-tagged wild-type biotin synthase except for mutant C188S, which despite numerous attempts (low temperature induction and IPTG concentrations <0.1 mm), remained intractably insoluble. Protein purity was estimated by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1). The apoenzymes of each of wild-type biotin synthase, His6-tagged biotin synthase, and mutants were prepared anaerobically using sodium dithionite and EDTA. The samples were then desalted using a G10 gel filtration column. ICP-AES analysis and UV-visible spectroscopy confirmed the absence of iron in the proteins. The samples were then reconstituted by incubation with FeCl3 and Na2S under similar conditions to those described previously (14.Tse Sum Bui B. Florentin D. Fournier F. Ploux O. Méjean A. Marquet A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20.Sanyal I. Cohen G. Flint D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3625-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Solutions of wild-type, His6-tagged, and C288T biotin synthase were all reddish brown in color, and they showed virtually identical UV-visible spectra with a maximum at 274 nm, a shoulder at 330 nm, and a distinctive peak at 420 nm (see Fig. 2). The spectra of the apo forms of each of these proteins were colorless and showed no peaks at 330 or 420 nm. Upon incubation with FeCl3 and Na2S for 2 h, their spectra were identical to that of the wild-type isolate. The mutants (C53S, C57S, and C60S) were colorless, and their spectra showed no peaks indicative of the presence of an [Fe-S] cluster. Moreover, their spectra did not show any significant changes even after prolonged incubation with FeCl3 and Na2S. All the mass spectrometry results were within 0.1% of the expected values for the polypeptide chains (TableI) indicating that the [Fe-S] cluster is lost under the MS conditions.Table IMolecular masses of the wild-type, His6-tagged, and mutant E. coli biotin synthases measured by electrospray mass spectrometryProteinExpectedActualWild-type biotin synthase38,64838,646His6-tagged biotin synthase39,67339,666C53S39,65739,656C57S39,65739,658C60S39,65739,652C288T39,67139,6705-μl samples of proteins (20 μm) in trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile/water (0.1:50:50%) solution were used in the measurements.

Open table in a new tab 5-μl samples of proteins (20 μm) in trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile/water (0.1:50:50%) solution were used in the measurements. The instrument was calibrated with a myoglobin standard. The estimated error of the molecular mass for each protein is within 0.1%. Analyses for iron, sulfur, and nickel were carried out on all proteins using ICP-AES, the Beinert method, and the ferrozine method (29.Stookey L.L. Anal. Chem. 1970; 42: 779-781Crossref Scopus (3589) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were adjusted to ∼27 μm (based on a monomeric mass of 39,673 Da for His6-tagged proteins and 38,648 Da for wild-type biotin synthase). The amount of sulfur (as S2-) in His6-tagged biotin synthase was virtually identical to that in the untagged protein and similar to the value previously reported by Sanyal et al. (20.Sanyal I. Cohen G. Flint D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3625-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) for wild type. Analysis for nickel content proved that there was negligible nickel binding. Iron analysis (Table II) on the purified proteins revealed a 1:1 ratio between iron and sulfide in both unmodified and His6-tagged biotin synthase in agreement with previously reported values (14.Tse Sum Bui B.

N-methyl-d-aspartate dopamine transporter γ-aminobutyric acid GABA transporter green fluorescent protein glycine transporters 1 and 2 serotonin transporter Glycine is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the spinal cord and the brain stem of vertebrates, where it participates in a variety of motor and sensory functions. In addition, glycine positively modulates the action of glutamate, the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, on postsynaptic NMDA1 receptors. The re-uptake of glycine into presynaptic nerve terminals or the surrounding fine glial processes plays a major role in the maintenance of low synaptic levels of the transmitter (1.Iversen L.L. Br.

Recently, a second GLYT2 isoform (GLYT2b) has been isolated, cloned, and characterized in our laboratory (19.Ponce J. Poyatos I. Aragón C. Giménez C. Zafra F. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 242: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The GLYT1 variants are distinguishable from the GLYT2 ones by their brain distribution (20.Zafra F. Aragón C. Olivares L.

In the absence of three-dimensional information from these proteins, a structure-function relationship can be obtained from site-directed mutagenesis approaches based on the homology between members of the same transporter family. Previous work from related GABA (GAT-1) and serotonin (SERT) transporters point to a tyrosine residue and its surroundings in the third transmembrane domain (TMIII) as being critical in substrate binding (22.Bismuth Y.

This tyrosine residue is conserved in all the family members, including the bacterial transporters (24.Nelson N. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1785-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the tyrosine may interact with a moiety common to all substrates of the family, namely the amino group (22.Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16096-16102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this study we have modified Tyr288 and the conserved Tyr289 located in the TMIII of GLYT2a transporter. By using a glycine transport assay and the whole cell recording configuration of the patch-clamp technique, we have studied the functional effects of these point modifications. We show that Tyr289 replacement either by Phe or Ser has a dramatic effect in glycine binding and transport, ion dependence, and sodium selectivity. This is the first study giving valuable information about the structure-function relationship of the neuronal GLYT2a glycine transporter. This was performed using a modification of the method of Higuchi (25.Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, New York1990: 177-183Google Scholar) as described (11.Olivares L. Aragón C. Giménez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9437-9442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Mutants and wild type cDNAs were subcloned downstream the cytomegalovirus promoter of pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. COS-7 and HEK-293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Transient expression in COS-7 cells was carried out using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the procedure indicated by the supplier. HEK-293 cells were transfected with FuGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C and then used to assay transport activity and surface expression. For patch-clamp experiments, HEK-293 cells were seeded on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips (125 × 10 3 cells/coverslip) placed in 12-well Corning dishes. The cDNA encoding for the GLYT2a transporter was cotransfected with that encoding for green fluorescent protein (GFP) in a 10/1 ratio, respectively, by using the FuGENE transfection technique (see above). Cells were used for patch-clamp experiments 24–72 h after transfection. Transport assays in transfected COS-7 cells were performed at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm Ca2Cl, 2.5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose) as described previously (26.Casado M.

Cells were incubated for the indicated times in 0.3 ml of the former solution containing 0.2 μm[2-3H]glycine (1.6 TBq/mmol) (NEN Life Science Products).

Proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to the method of Laemmli (28.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) and analyzed by Western blot for immunoreactivity against anti-GLYT2a antibodies as described previously (20.Zafra F.

Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (30.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Cells were viewed at a total magnification of 400 under ultraviolet light illumination, in order to identify the GFP-expressing fluorescent cells. Solutions were applied by means of a polyethylene tubing (opening, 500 μm) approached within 3 mm of the cell under investigation. Pipettes (5–10 megohms) were pulled from thick walled borosilicate glass capillaries (Phymep, Paris, France). Whole-cell currents were recorded with an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) connected to a Pentium class computer driven by the pClamp7 software (Axon Instruments). The extracellular solution (pH 7.4) contained (in mm): NaCl (147), KCl (5.Simpson Jr., R.K. Gondo M. Robertson C.S. Goodman J.C. Neurochem. Res. 1995; 20: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), CaCl2 (2.Johnston G.A.R. Iversen L.L. J.

When the Na+ dependence was studied, NaCl was replaced either by choline chloride or by LiCl. When the chloride dependence was studied, NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2 were replaced by gluconate salts. The pipette solution (pH 7.2) contained (in mm): CsCl (160), MgCl2 (1.Iversen L.L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1971; 41: 571-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), CaCl2 (1.Iversen L.L. Br. J.

The calculated free Ca2+concentration was 10−8m. Nonlinear regression fits of experimental data were performed with Origin (Microcal Software). The statistical analysis was done with data from single experiments. All the experiments were performed three times. According to the theoretical topological model proposed for the Na+- and Cl−- dependent neurotransmitter transporter family (15.Liu Q.R. López-Corcuera B. Mandiyan S. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22802-22808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which recently has received strong experimental support (31.Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12675-12681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), Tyr289 and Tyr288 of glycine transporter GLYT2a are located in the transmembrane domain III. Tyrosine 289 is stringently conserved in all known members of the family, and Tyr288 is a position mainly occupied by aromatic residues in most of these transporters. To examine if these positions are involved in the function of GLYT2a, we have changed each of these residues to phenylalanine, tryptophan, and serine by site-directed mutagenesis. Subsequently, the cDNAs were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells and used in a transport activity assay. Fig. 1 shows the results of sodium-dependent [3H]glycine transport of the tyrosine 288 and 289 mutants of GLYT2a transporter. In the case of tyrosine 289, all replacement mutants were devoid of any detectable specific transport activity. Aromatic replacement mutants of tyrosine 288 exhibited significant transport of [3H]glycine, ranging from about 26% to 65% of the wild type rate for Y288W and Y288F mutants, respectively. Only when tyrosine 288 was replaced by serine, transport into cells expressing Y288S was indistinguishable from the basal glycine uptake. To determine whether the impaired transport of the mutants was due to a poor protein expression or to low surface transporter levels, we performed cell surface biotinylation experiments (Fig.2). Plasma membrane proteins were labeled with the membrane-impermeable reagent sulfosuccimido-NHS-biotin, and the biotinylated proteins were precipitated with immobilized streptavidin, followed by Western blot with previously characterized specific antibodies against the NH2-terminal domain of GLYT2 (20.Zafra F. Aragón C. Olivares L. Danbolt N.C. Giménez C. Storm-Mathisen J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3952-3969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Zafra F. Gomeza J. Olivares L. Aragón C. Giménez C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1342-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The antibodies recognized two bands; the 90-kDa one is the totally processed transporter, present at the plasma membrane (Fig.2, A and B), and the 67-kDa band corresponds to the partially glycosylated protein, which is mainly intracellular (Fig.2, A and C). No significant differences were detected in the total and surface expression of the mutants respect to the wild type. One exception was the Y288S mutant, in which neither the totally processed 90-kDa band nor the partially glycosylated form of the transporter appears (Fig. 2, A and B,lane 7). This result is consistent with the absence of transport activity shown by this mutant (Fig. 1). The results from the experiments shown in Figs. 1 and 2 indicate that Tyr289mutant transporters have an intrinsic defect in the transport process, but Tyr288 mutants (with the exception of Y288S) retain significant glycine transport activity. We used an electrophysiological approach to address the reason underlying the transport defect of the mutants Y288F, Y289F, and Y289S by characterizing their response to extracellularly applied glycine. For these studies, we selected the structurally closest aromatic (Phe) and nonaromatic but polar (Ser) substitutions, both showing nonaltered external membrane levels. Patch-clamp experiments were performed in HEK-293 transiently cotransfected with cDNAs encoding glycine transporters and recombinant GFP. Fluorescent HEK-293 cells were voltage-clamped at a holding voltage of −40 mV, and transport currents were elicited by application of 0.01–30 mm glycine. Glycine concentrations up to 30 mm failed to evoke any measurable current in control HEK-293 cells (data not shown), demonstrating that nonspecific glycine transport was not involved in the glycine responses obtained in transfected cells. Fig.3 shows the concentration dependence relationships of the glycine-induced currents obtained with HEK-293 cells transiently expressing either the GLYT2a wild type or the mutants Y289F, Y289S, and Y288F (Fig. 3 C). The current recorded in wild type-expressing cells was lower than in the mutants (Fig.3 A). This was not always observed (see Figs.Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6), which might be due to the high variability shown in the current amplitude recorded from GLYT2-expressing HEK 293 cells. Indeed, this observation has also been reported for HEK cells stably expressing GLYT2 wild type (21.López-Corcuera B. Martı́nez-Maza R. Núñez E. Roux M. Supplisson S. Aragón C. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2211-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Data were fit to the general equation described in the legend of Fig. 3. The GLYT2 wild type transporter was characterized by an EC50 for glycine of 0.087 mm, and a similar value was found for the Y288F mutant (EC50 = 0.1 mm), indicating that Tyr288 can be replaced by Phe without significant alterations in GLYT2a function. On the other hand, the Y289F and the Y289S mutants displayed higher EC50 values than the wild type (1.5 ± 0.18 mm and 3.95 ± 0.34 mm, respectively). In addition, the Hill coefficients were equal or very close to 1 for all assayed transporters. The dramatic decrease in the apparent affinity for glycine induced by the replacement of Tyr289 (Fig. 3) is consistent with the lack of transport activity observed for position 289 mutants in the glycine uptake experiments (Fig. 1). Indeed, transport assays were performed in the presence of a concentration of tritiated glycine (0.2 μm) low enough to avoid interference with low affinity nonspecific glycine transport.Figure 6Chloride dependence of glycine evoked currents in HEK-293 transiently expressing GLYT2a wild type and Y289F and Y289S mutants.

The glycine concentrations used were: 1 mm for the wild type (A), 10 mm for the Y289F mutant and 30 mm for the Y289S mutant (B); given the similitude of the chloride dependence in both Tyr289 mutants, only a recording from the Y289S is displayed in B.

Each point represents the mean ± S.E. of experimental data obtained from three to five cells. The curve for the wild type is the best fit to the single-site model equation, I = 100 ([Cl−]/[Cl−] + EC50), whereI is the percentage of the current recorded in 158 mm Cl−, [Cl−] is the concentration of chloride, and EC50 is the concentration of Cl− eliciting 50% of the maximal current; the calculated EC50 for wild type is 9.1 ± 2.7 mm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Sodium dependence of glycine evoked currents in HEK-293 cells transiently expressing GLYT2a wild type and Y289F and Y289S mutants.

The curves are the best fit of the mean data points to the single-site model equation, I = I max([Na+] nH/[Na+] nH+ EC50 nH), where I is the percentage of the current obtained in normal extracellular medium (147 mm Na+), I max is the maximal current fixed as 110, [Na+] is the concentration of sodium, n H is the Hill coefficient, and EC50 is the concentration of Na+ eliciting 50% of the maximal current. Each point represents the mean ± S.E. of experimental data obtained from three to five cells. The calculated sodium EC50 values and Hill coefficients are as follows: wild type, EC50 = 32.5 ± 0.8 mm,n H = 1.6 ± 0.05; Y289F mutant, EC50 = 20.01 ± 1.72 mm,n H = 0.92 ± 0.07; Y289S mutant, EC50 = 9.38 ± 0.37 mm,n H = 0.76 ± 0.03.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) By applying a maximal concentration of glycine equal to 10-fold the previously calculated EC50, avoiding that the substrate concentration was a limiting factor (32.Mager S. Kleinberger-Doron N. Keshet G.I. Davidson N. Kanner B.I. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5405-5414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we addressed the sodium dependence of the glycine induced currents in the GLYT2a wild type and both Tyr289 mutants. The complete replacement of sodium chloride by choline chloride fully inhibited the current induced by glycine for the wild type and mutant transporters (Fig. 4). Progressive increase of the sodium concentration caused an increase in the current amplitude for all three transporters. The wild type exhibited a sigmoidal Na+ dependence with an EC50 of 32.5 ± 0.8 mm and a Hill coefficient of 1.6, which reflects the implication of at least two Na+ ions, consistent with data from GAT1 obtained in equivalent conditions (32.Mager S. Kleinberger-Doron N. Keshet G.I. Davidson N. Kanner B.I. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5405-5414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), and accordingly to the proposed stoichiometry of two or more Na+, one Cl−, and one glycine molecule (21.López-Corcuera B. Martı́nez-Maza R. Núñez E. Roux M. Supplisson S. Aragón C. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2211-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 34.Aragón C. Giménez C. Mayor F. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the EC50 for sodium was shifted toward lower values for both mutants (EC50 = 20.0 ± 1.7 mm and 9.4 ± 0.4 mm for Y289F and Y289S, respectively), while the Hill coefficients were found to be less than 1. Lower concentrations of Na+ (0.1–1 mm) were assayed for the Y289S mutant, which showed the highest apparent affinity for Na+, and the results further confirmed the previously calculated EC50 and Hill coefficient (data not shown). These results suggest a modification in the cation-transporter interaction beyond a mere increase in the affinity for Na+. In another set of experiments, the current evoked by maximal glycine concentrations was recorded first in the presence of 147 mm sodium chloride and subsequently in the presence of 147 mm lithium chloride (Fig. 5). Switching from Na+ to Li+ in the absence of glycine did not induce any recordable current at −40 mV. The total replacement of sodium by lithium almost completely abolished the current elicited by the maximal glycine concentration of 10 mm on HEK-293 cells expressing the GLYT2a wild type. In contrast, in the Y289F and Y289S mutants, total sodium replacement by lithium did not prevent glycine evoked currents whose amplitudes reached 50% and about 100% of the control current recorded in the sodium chloride containing medium, respectively. Results from Figs. 4and 5 clearly demonstrate that Tyr289 of GLYT2a transporter is involved in the Na+ coupling and in the cation selectivity. To study the chloride dependence of the GLYT2a wild type and the 289 mutants, we applied maximal glycine concentrations while replacing chloride ions by gluconate. As shown in Fig. 6, the wild type displayed a typical hyperbolic chloride dependence, with an EC50 of 9.1 ± 2.7 mm and a Hill coefficient of 1, suggesting a coupling ratio of 1 chloride ion for 1 glycine molecule consistent with the proposed stoichiometry (21.López-Corcuera B. Martı́nez-Maza R. Núñez E. Roux M. Supplisson S. Aragón C. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2211-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 34.Aragón C. Giménez C. Mayor F. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For the wild type and mutants, a significant transport current was still present in the absence of chloride. However, while this current amplitude did not exceed 25% of the maximal current for the wild type, it achieved about 50% or more of the maximal current for both mutants, indicating that those two Tyr289 mutations induced a marked decrease of the requirement for chloride. The results included in the present report demonstrate, by using biochemical and electrophysiological methods, that tyrosine at position 289 located in the putative TMIII domain of GLYT2a is essential for transport activity. We mutated Tyr289 and Tyr288 in GLYT2a as the former position is strictly conserved throughout the Na+- and Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporters family, and Tyr288 is conserved in most of the members except in rDAT, where this position is occupied for a Phe residue. The position equivalent to Tyr289 of GLYT2a in GAT1 and SERT has recently been proved to be involved in substrate binding (22.Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16096-16102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 23.Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Moreover, Lin et al. (35.Lin Z. Wang W. Kopajtic T. Revay R.S. Uhl G.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 434-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), have shown the involvement of Phe155 of rDAT in dopamine uptake and ligand selectivity; this position is homologous to Tyr288 of GLYT2a. When the Tyr288 of GLYT2a was replaced by Phe, more than 50% of wild type glycine uptake activity was retained and a similar EC50 for glycine in substrate-evoked currents was observed. In contrast, all the substitutions of Tyr289 resulted in uptake levels not significantly different from the background. With the exception of the Y288S mutant, which showed an abnormal protein degradation, wild type and mutant transporters reached similar levels in the membrane. Once Tyr289 was identified as a residue essential for activity, we proceeded to analyze electrophysiologically the mutants Y289F and Y289S in an attempt to shed some light on the structure-function relationships that govern the transport of ions and glycine. Measurements of glycine-evoked steady state currents in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells revealed EC50 values for glycine 17-fold (Y289F) and 45-fold (Y289S) higher than that of the wild type, with the Hill coefficient being close to 1 in all cases. The EC50 for glycine of the wild type GLYT2a was roughly comparable with uptake K m values previously reported in transiently transfected COS-7 cells (19.Ponce J. Poyatos I. Aragón C. Giménez C. Zafra F. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 242: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and in stably transfected HEK-293 cells (21.López-Corcuera B. Martı́nez-Maza R. Núñez E. Roux M. Supplisson S. Aragón C. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2211-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), with minor differences attributable to different expression systems. Given the positive net charge translocated by the transport cycle (34.Aragón C. Giménez C. Mayor F. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and the similar ionic dependence and kinetic parameters of both glycine uptake and glycine-evoked currents, we assumed a tight correlation between these two processes by analogy with GAT1 (32.Mager S. Kleinberger-Doron N. Keshet G.I. Davidson N. Kanner B.I. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5405-5414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and hDAT (36.Sonders M.S. Zhu S.J. Zahniser N.R. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 960-974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), even though our system did not allow simultaneous measurements of substrate influx and steady-state currents. Interesting to note is that the kinetic parameters obtained either by uptake assays or glycine evoked steady-state currents do describe a cycle which involve steps other than binding, namely translocation and release of substrates. The affinities, in the millimolar range, of the Y289F and Y289S mutants are consistent with the lack of glycine uptake in our experimental conditions. These results are consistent with those obtained by Bismuth et al.(22.Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16096-16102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar); mutations at the homologous position of GAT1 rendered transporters with a defect in GABA recognition, being unimpaired the transient capacitative and Li+ leak currents associated respectively to Na+ and Cl− binding. The transport-specific steps such as the Na+ binding have been previously addressed for the GAT1 transporter by measuring capacitative currents from transient voltage jumps in the presence or absence of Na+ (39.Cammack J.N. Rakhilin S.V. Schwartz E.A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 949-960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although small differences existed in our experiments between the time courses of the transients observed in NaCl and choline chloride, we could not use reliably subtracted currents in the absence of a potent inhibitor to confirm the validity of the measurement. In the absence of any known GLYT2a-specific antagonist to perform binding assays or analyze transient currents mediated by the transporter, there is no possibility of addressing specific steps in the transport cycle but to study the substrate and ionic dependence of the entire process. We found that mutations of Tyr289indeed altered Na+ and Cl− dependence of currents induced by nonlimiting concentrations of glycine. Replacement of sodium by choline abolished glycine induced steady-state currents in wild type and mutant transporters. Na+ dose dependence of glycine evoked currents were built for wild type GLYT2a, Y289F, and Y289S at glycine concentrations 10-fold the EC50in each transporter. Within the isotonic range of substitution, mutations at Tyr289 actually produced both a shift to a higher apparent affinity for Na+ and a loss of cooperativity, the latter arguing for dramatic changes in the cation-transporter interaction beyond a mere increase in affinity. Interestingly, the substitution to Phe, keeping the aromatic moiety at the 289 position, has a higher affinity for glycine and lower affinity for Na+ than the replacement by Ser, which displayed the lowest apparent affinity for glycine and the highest for Na+. Moreover, mutants Y289F and Y289S displayed glycine evoked steady-state currents at 147 mm Li+. While for the wild type, these currents were less than 10% of the current induced by saturating concentrations of glycine in Na+, they reached 50% in the Y289F mutant and around 100% in the Y289S mutant (Fig. 5). These results indicate that the Y289S mutant has lost its selectivity for Na+, and point to the aromatic ring at 289 as a possible molecular determinant of the cation selectivity in GLYT2a, given the partial Li+ tolerance observed in the Y289F mutant. It could be another example of the importance of cation-π interactions (37.Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2358) Google Scholar) in recognition of positive charges or polarities to add to the growing list of putative transmembrane aromatic residues essential for function in this neurotransmitter transporter family (24.Nelson N. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1785-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Nonabsolute requirement for Cl− was reported for GAT1 (32.Mager S. Kleinberger-Doron N. Keshet G.I. Davidson N. Kanner B.I. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5405-5414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,33.Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and for the recently cloned human amino acid transporter B0+ (38.Sloan J.L. Mager S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23740-23745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), a new member of the Na+-, Cl--dependent neurotransmitter transporter family that shows the highest similarity with glycine and proline transporters. Cl− dependence of glycine evoked steady-state currents was hyperbolic for the wild type transporter, while it was almost vanished in tyrosine 289 mutants, which displayed currents in the absence of Cl− higher than 50% of the current observed at 158 mm chloride. This behavior in mutant transporters showing higher apparent affinity for Na+ is in agreement with the results obtained by Mageret al. (32.Mager S. Kleinberger-Doron N. Keshet G.I. Davidson N. Kanner B.I. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5405-5414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the W68L GAT1 mutant. Cl−would act favoring the binding of Na+. Therefore, in Y289F and Y289S mutants, which showed a higher affinity for Na+, the transporter might be completely occupied by Na+ even in the absence of Cl−. All the above results can be interpreted on the basis of two hypothesis. First, the sum of alterations at the putative Na+ binding site, i.e. increased affinity, decreased cooperativity, and loss of Na+ selectivity, could account for the dramatic loss of glycine affinity. Assuming, as reported for GAT1, that Na+ binding dominates the entire cycle by promoting a conformational change which enhances substrate binding and translocation (32.Mager S. Kleinberger-Doron N. Keshet G.I. Davidson N. Kanner B.I. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5405-5414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Cammack J.N. Rakhilin S.V. Schwartz E.A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 949-960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), a higher affinity for Na+ in the Y289F and Y289S mutants would correspond with a more inefficient release of substrate into the cell. The loss of selectivity and co-operativity for Na+ binding would indicates that Tyr289 could be part of the external gate involved in initial Na+ binding, as has been suggested for the related serotonin transporter (40.Sur C. Betz H. Schloss P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7639-7644Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As a second hypothesis, a specific defect in glycine binding would underlie alterations of ion coupling and cation selectivity, and would find an explanation in the conceptual framework of a common aqueous pathway for substrate and ions (41.Sonders M.S. Amara S.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 42.Su A. Mager S. Mayo S.L. Lester H.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 762-777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recently, numerous reports have appeared supporting a channel-like behavior in this family of neurotransmitter transporters (36.Sonders M.S. Zhu S.J. Zahniser N.R. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 960-974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Lin F. Lester H., A. Mager S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3126-3135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 44.Mager S. Min C.

DeFelice L.J. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, the absence of three-dimensional data and the possibility to incorporate this postulated common pathway features that explain ion coupling, makes this scheme very useful. In GLYT2a, replacement of Tyr289 would drastically alter the way in which glycine binds and/or translocates, thus modifying translocated species interactions in a common permeation pathway (51.Petersen C.I. DeFelice L.J. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This in turn would explain the altered Na+ interaction and the ability of Li+ to maintain glycine evoked currents as well as the altered Cl− dependence. We have no direct evidence of that Tyr289, located within two helical turns of the extracellular border following the topology derived from hydropathy plots, is exposed to an aqueous pore. However, the TMIII topology of SERT, based on Cys scanning mutagenesis, proposed the homologous Tyr as facing an aqueous pore (23.Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We found that Cys substitution in positions Ala286 and Ile292 of GLYT2a 2C. Aragón, unpublished results. gave a perfect correlation with the results reported for the homologous positions in SERT. As Y289F and Y289S mutations drastically affect apparent affinity for glycine, ion coupling, and a gradual loss of cation selectivity of transport-associated currents, it is tempting to apply the paradigms of ion channel research; given a mutation in an ion channel able to change ion selectivity, the affected residue is likely to lie in or near the permeation pathway (52.Lester H.A. Cao Y. Mager S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 807-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We thank Enrique Núñez and Danielle Godet for expert technical assistance."

GR-Gαs-S bound glucagon with an affinity similar to that of GR, while GR-Gαs-L showed a 10-fold higher affinity for glucagon. In the presence of GTPγS, GR-Gαs-L reverted to the low affinity glucagon binding conformation. Both GR-Gαs-L and GR-Gαs-S were constitutively active, causing elevated basal levels of cAMP even in the absence of glucagon. A mutant GR that failed to activate Gs (G23D1R) was fused to Gαs-L. G23D1R-Gαs-L bound glucagon with high affinity, but failed to elevate cAMP levels, suggesting that the mechanisms of GR-mediated Gαs-L activation and Gαs-L-induced high affinity glucagon binding are independent. Both GR-Gαs-S and GR-Gαs-L bound the antagonist desHis1[Nle9,Ala11,Ala16]glucagon amide with affinities similar to GR. The antagonist displayed partial agonist activity with GR-Gαs-L, but not with GR-Gαs-S. Therefore, the partial agonist activity of the antagonist observed in intact cells appears to be due to GRs coupled to Gαs-L.

Upon glucagon binding, the glucagon receptor (GR) interacts with the heterotrimeric G protein, Gs, to catalyze GDP/GTP exchange. Two predominant splice variants of Gαs, a short and a long form (Gαs-S and Gαs-L) result from differential splicing of a single precursor mRNA (4.Robishaw J.D. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

The functional significance of the multiple forms of Gαs is unclear, but the conservation of two predominant isoforms suggests that the efficiency of interactions between receptors and Gαsmight be modulated by differences in structure between the isoforms as well as the stoichiometry of these proteins in cells (7.Walseth T.F.

X-ray crystallographic studies have revealed that Gα subunits consist of a GTPase domain that resembles the oncogene protein p21 ras and a helical domain (11.Sunhara R.K. Tesmer J.J.G. Gilman A.G.

Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). In the structures, the guanine-nucleotide binding site lies in a cleft between these two distinct domains. A 15-amino acid insert in Gαs-L following residue 71 is located in the first of two linkers that connect the Ras-like domain and the helical domain. Linker 1 lies near two of three “switch” regions in the Gα structure that undergo conformational rearrangement to allow nucleotide exchange. Thus, the 15-residue insert in Gαs-L may influence the kinetics of receptor-mediated nucleotide exchange. Glucagon is known to exhibit both high and low binding affinities for GRs, which is thought to be due to the existence of a heterogeneous population of receptors in cells, one having a high affinity and the other a low affinity for ligand (14.Sonne O. Berg T. Christoffersen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3203-3210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Horwitz E.D. Wyborski R.J. Gurd R.S. J. Biol.

An expanded ternary complex model of receptor activation postulates that GPCRs exist in an equilibrium between two interconverting states that are stabilized by association with G proteins, even prior to ligand binding. The differential expression of the two forms of Gαs in various tissues suggests the possibility for functional consequences for glucagon-dependent activation of GRs that may account for the observed differences in receptor affinities. To test this hypothesis, we prepared fusion constructs of GR with Gαs-S and Gαs-L and assessed the fusion proteins for signal transduction properties in transiently transfected COS-1 cells. The abilities of glucagon and the glucagon antagonist desHis1[Nle9,Ala11,Ala16]glucagon amide to bind to the expressed GR-Gαs-S and GR-Gαs-L were measured. In addition, cAMP measurements were carried out to evaluate the ability of GR-Gαs-S and GR-Gαs-L to couple to adenylyl cyclase. Both GR-Gαs-S and GR-Gαs-L caused glucagon-dependent adenylyl cyclase activation and were constitutively active. The antagonist bound to GR-Gαs-S and GR-Gαs-L with equal affinities, but behaved as a weak partial agonist when bound to GR-Gαs-L but not with GR-Gαs-S. Finally, a non-signaling GR mutant (G23D1R) in which the second (i2) and third (i3) intracellular loops were each replaced with the first (i1) intracellular loop sequence from the D4 dopamine receptor, was fused to Gαs-L and studied. Interestingly, the G23D1R-Gαs-L was not constitutively active, but did display high affinity glucagon binding. Our results using GR-Gαs fusion proteins demonstrate that Gαs-S and Gαs-L have different effects on GR-mediated signaling, and suggest that receptors pre-coupled to Gαs-L account for GTP-sensitive high affinity glucagon binding.

N-Glycosidase F, endoglycosidase H, and GTPγS were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The GR-Gαs fusion DNAs were generated using a combination of restriction fragment replacement and PCR-based techniques in a modified pGEM-2 (Invitrogen) cloning vector. All nucleotide sequences were verified by fluorescence-based sequencing (Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems model 377A DNA sequencer). GR-Gαs-L was assembled in a four-part ligation consisting of: (i) the largeAvrII-NotI restriction fragment from the GR synthetic gene in pGEM-2, which deletes the last eight codons (position 478–485) and the termination codon from the C terminus of GR; (ii) aBseRI-NsiI restriction fragment encoding residues 20–385 of Gαs-L; (iii) a 78-base pair synthetic duplex with cohesive ends for AvrII and BseRI encoding the C-terminal residues 478–485 of GR and the N-terminal residues 2–19 of Gαs-L; and (iv) a 30-base pair synthetic duplex with cohesive ends for NsiI and NotI encoding the C-terminal 386–393 residues of Gαs-L, two successive stop codons, and a NotI site at the 3′-end of the open reading frame in the fusion. GR-Gαs-S DNA was generated by the overlap extension PCR protocol using Pfu polymerase (24.Vallejo A.N. Pogulis R.J. Pease L.R. PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 603-612Google Scholar) and the GR-Gαs-L construct as template. A set of primers was synthesized to remove codons for amino acids 72–86 and to replace Glu71 by Asp. In the first round of PCR, two overlapping DNA sequences were amplified independently. The sense primer at the deletion site and an antisense primer from theNsiI site of Gαs-L were used in one PCR reaction, and the antisense deletion primer and an extension primer from the SacII site of GR were used in another reaction. In a second round of PCR, the two overlapping sequences were spliced together to form a single product using the terminal extension primers from the complementary strands. The resulting PCR-amplified fragment was digested with AccI and BglII and ligated into GR-Gαs-L in pGEM-2. After DNA sequencing, aSpeI-NotI fragment with the correct Gαs-S sequence was introduced in place of the analogous restriction fragment in GR-Gαs-L in the eukaryotic expression vector pMT (25.Franke R.R.

In GR mutant G23D1R, the i2 loop (Ser252–Glu261) and the i3 loop (Leu334–Ala349) were replaced by an 11-amino acid peptide derived from the dopamine D4 receptor sequence (26.Cypess A.M. Unson C.G.

To prepare G23D1R-Gαs-L, a KpnI-SacII restriction fragment from GR-Gαs-L in pGEM-2 was replaced by the analogous restriction fragment from G23D1R in pcDNA3 (26.Cypess A.M. Unson C.G. Wu C.-R.

To transfer Gαs-L into pMT, a BseRI-NotI restriction fragment from GR-Gαs-L in pGEM-2, corresponding to residues 20–393 of Gαs-L, and a 67-base pair EcoRI-BseRI synthetic duplex containing the codons for N-terminal residues 1–19 of Gαs-L were joined with an EcoRI-NotI restriction fragment from pMT in a three-part ligation reaction. GR-Gαs fusion genes were expressed in COS-1 cells by transient transfection using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). In addition, GR was independently co-expressed with Gαs-L by transfecting COS-1 cells with equimolar ratios of vectors.

Unson C.G. Kim H.N. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29321-29328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Competitive binding studies with 125I-glucagon were also performed in membranes expressing GR and Gαs fusion proteins in the absence or presence of 100 μm GTPγS. Binding and adenylyl cyclase activities were also measured in COS-1 cells that had been co-transfected with GR and Gαs-L. Ligand binding and adenylyl cyclase studies were performed at least three times to verify reproducibility. The data were fit to a four-parameter logistic function and the IC50 and EC50 values calculated from the inflection point of the best-fit curve with Sigma Plot version 4 (Jandel Scientific Software). The rat GR was fused with the short and long forms of Gαs (Gαs-S and Gαs-L) to construct GR-Gαs-S and GR-Gαs-L. The 3′-terminal codon of the open reading frame of the synthetic GR gene was joined directly to codon 2 of the cDNAs encoding the two Gαs variants. The nonsense codon of the GR gene and the initiator-Met codon of the Gαs cDNAs were removed. Gαs-L differs from Gαs-S by 16 amino acids. Gαs-L contains a Glu in place of Asp at position 71 and an insert of 15 amino acids starting with position 72 (17). The 15-amino acid insert in Gαs-L is located within the first of two linkers connecting the Ras and helical domains in the structure of Gαs (Fig. 1). Gαs-L was also fused to GR mutant G23D1R, in which the i2 and i3 loops were both replaced with the i1 loop of the D4 dopamine receptor, to form G23D1R-Gαs-L. G23D1R did not couple to cellular Gαs as described previously (26.Cypess A.M. Unson C.G. Wu C.-R. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19455-19464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, experiments were carried out in which GR and Gαs-L were co-expressed from separate vectors in COS-1 cells. Immunoblot analysis of the membrane preparations from cells expressing GR-Gαs-L was carried out with DK-12 anti-GR antibody (Fig. 2 A) and RM anti-Gαs antibody (Fig. 2 B). The fusion protein GR-Gαs-L immunoreacted with DK-12 to yield a band with an apparent molecular mass of 102 kDa afterN-glycosidase treatment (Fig. 2 A) (20.Unson C.G. Cypess A.M. Kim H.N.

This result was expected since the apparent molecular mass of Gαs-L is 52 kDa (4.Robishaw J.D. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9587-9590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the GR migrates as a broad band with an apparent molecular mass of 55–75 kDa that collapsed to a band at 50 kDa after N-glycosidase F treatment. GR-Gαs-S migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 95 kDa, which is consistent with the apparent molecular mass of Gαs-S (45 kDa) plus GR (Fig. 2 A) (4.Robishaw J.D. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9587-9590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RM antibody, which is directed against a C-terminal peptide of Gαs, did not react with GR. However, as expected it detected in COS-1 cells the endogenous short and long forms of Gαs, which migrate with apparent molecular masses of 45 and 52 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and 2). The immunoblots consistently showed that the COS-1 cell membranes contained a greater proportion of the short form relative to the long form of Gαs. Bands at apparent molecular masses of 102 and 95 kDa corresponding to deglycosylated GR-Gαs-L and GR-Gαs-S (Fig.2 B, lanes 4 and 6), respectively, were also detected by RM antibody. The membrane preparations also contained minor bands that were immunoreactive with RM antibody at 35, 40, and 60 kDa that could be degradation products derived from the fusion proteins. The fusion proteins were not recognized by anti-GR antibody ST-18, which was generated against a C-terminal peptide of GR. This suggests that the ST-18 epitope is eclipsed in the fusion or that the free C-terminal carboxylic acid group is required for immunoreactivity (data not shown) (18.Carruthers C.J.L. Unson C.G. Kim H.N. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29321-29328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both GR and GR-Gαs-L were insensitive to endoglycosidase H digestion, indicating that they were properly processed and transported to the cell surface (20.Unson C.G. Cypess A.M. Kim H.N.

Increasing concentrations of glucagon were used to compete with125I-glucagon for binding to membranes from COS-1 cells containing the expressed fusion proteins.

GR-Gαs-S displayed an affinity for glucagon that was essentially the same as non-fused GR (Fig. 4). In contrast, GR-Gαs-L bound glucagon with an IC50 value of 3.2 nm (Fig. 4, Table I). GR and Gαs-L were co-expressed in COS-1 cells to determine if simply increasing the proportion of Gαs-L to GR increased glucagon-binding affinity. The overexpression of Gαs-L was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using RM antibody to detect an increase in the intensity of the 52-kDa band, which represents total combined endogenous and recombinant Gαs-L expression (data not shown). The expression of GR in combination with overexpression of Gαs-L resulted in an increase in glucagon binding affinity. However, the IC50 value obtained for the fusion protein GR-Gαs-L (IC50 value = 3.2 nm) was still about 5-fold lower than that obtained for GR in the presence of excess Gαs-L (IC50value = 16 nm) (Table I).Table IPharmacological parameters of glucagon receptor-Gαs fusion proteinsGlucagonAntagonist aThe glucagon antagonist, desHis1[Nle9,Ala11,Ala16]glucagon amide, showed <0.001% adenylyl cyclase activity relative to glucagon when assayed in liver membranes (22) and weak partial agonist activity (0.01% relative to glucagon) when assayed in COS-1 cells.GR-GαsCompetitive binding (IC50) bThe concentration of unlabeled glucagon or antagonist required to displace 50% of receptor-bound125I-glucagon.

Open table in a new tab Mutation of the loops i2 and i3 of GR has little effect on the ligand-binding pocket of the receptor. GR mutant G23D1R bound glucagon with an affinity similar to that of the wild-type GR (26.Cypess A.M. Unson C.G. Wu C.-R. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19455-19464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, G23D1R was unable to activate endogenous Gαs in COS-1 cells as measured by cAMP accumulation, or in HEK-293T cells as measured by calcium flux (26.Cypess A.M. Unson C.G. Wu C.-R. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19455-19464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Despite the inability of G23D1R to activate Gαs, tethering G23D1R to Gαs-L in the fusion protein G23D1R-Gαs-L led to a 10-fold increase in affinity for glucagon. The IC50 value for competitive displacement of labeled glucagon from G23D1R-Gαs-L (IC50 value = 6.3 nm) was similar to that of the wild-type GR (Table I). Competitive binding of glucagon by the fusion proteins GR-Gαs-S and GR-Gαs-L was also measured in the presence of GTPγS, a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue. The affinity of glucagon for GR and for GR-Gαs-S was not affected by the presence of 100 μm GTPγS. This result suggests that GR-Gαs-S displayed a single low affinity state that was independent of GTP. However, GR-Gαs-L displayed two glucagon-binding affinities. In the presence of 100 μmGTPγS, the binding affinity of glucagon for GR-Gαs-L shifted to an IC50 value about 10-fold higher than that observed in the absence of GTPγS (Fig.5). The binding affinity of the glucagon analogue desHis1[Nle9,Ala11,Ala16]glucagon amide for the GR-Gαs fusion proteins was also evaluated. The glucagon analogue binds to native GRs in rat liver membranes with an affinity similar to that of glucagon and effectively inhibits glucagon action (22.Unson C.G. Wu C.-R. Fitzpatrick K.J. Merrifield R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12548-12551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In COS-1 cell membranes expressing recombinant GRs, desHis1[Nle9,Ala11,Ala16]glucagon amide displayed a slightly lower binding affinity (IC50 = 71 nm) than glucagon. The glucagon analogue had the same binding affinity for GR-Gαs-S, GR-Gαs-L, and GR (Table I). Bringing the GR and Gαs signaling partners in close proximity in the fusion proteins did not lead to higher binding affinities for the antagonist even in the absence of GTP. The fusion proteins were assayed for the ability to mediate an increase in intracellular cAMP upon stimulation with glucagon. The fusion proteins GR-Gαs-S and GR-Gαs-L caused glucagon-dependent adenylyl cyclase activation, which led to an increase in intracellular cAMP concentrations in transfected COS-1 cells. The EC50 value of glucagon-dependent adenylyl cyclase activation in COS-1 cells expressing GR was 5.8 nm (Table I). Essentially the same EC50 value was obtained for GR-Gαs-L (5.1 nm). Consistent with a lower glucagon binding affinity, GR-Gαs-S exhibited an EC50 value that was 4 times higher than that measured for GR-Gαs-L or non-fused GR (22.4 nm). In addition, expression of both fusion proteins GR-Gαs-S and GR-Gαs-L produced elevated basal levels of cAMP in the absence of glucagon, which is characteristic of constitutive receptor signaling (Fig. 6). The constitutive activity of the fusion proteins GR-Gαs-S and GR-Gαs-L was not suppressed by desHis1[Nle9,Ala11,Ala16]glucagon amide. The fact that desHis1[Nle9,Ala11,Ala16]glucagon amide had no effect on the constitutive activity of the fusion proteins confirms that the elevated basal activity is not caused by endogenous glucagon. In the classification of antagonists, this result would mean that desHis1[Nle9,Ala11,Ala16]glucagon amide is a neutral antagonist, not a negative antagonist or inverse agonist (27.Samama P. Pei G. Costa T. Cotecchia S. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 390-394PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Milligan G. Bond R.A. Lee M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 10-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). DesHis1[Nle9,Ala11,Ala16]glucagon amide showed no measurable adenylyl cyclase activity (<0.001% relative to glucagon), when assayed in liver membrane preparations. However, in COS-1 cells expressing recombinant GRs, a small cAMP elevation, 0.01% relative to glucagon, was observed upon treatment with desHis1[Nle9,Ala11,Ala16]glucagon amide, consistent with very weak partial agonist activity (Fig.7). Interestingly, the glucagon analogue induced adenylyl cyclase activity above baseline only in cells expressing GR-Gαs-L, but not in cells expressing GR-Gαs-S (Fig. 7). This observation suggests that the partial agonist activity in intact cells induced by desHis1[Nle9,Ala11,Ala16]glucagon amide may be attributed to receptors that are coupled to Gαs-L, and not Gαs-S.Figure 7Adenylyl cyclase activity of COS-1 cells expressing GR and GR-Gαs fusion genes in the presence of glucagon antagonist.

By determining second-order rate constants for the reaction of cysteine mutants at α184–α197 with the thiol-specific biotin derivative (+)-biotinyl-3-maleimidopropionamidyl-3,6-dioxaoctanediamine, we now show that only very subtle differences in reactivity (∼10-fold) are detectable, arguing that the entire region is solvent-exposed. Importantly, biotinylation in the presence of saturating concentrations of the long neurotoxin α-Bgtx is significantly retarded for positions αW187C, αF189C, and reduced wild-type receptors (αCys192 and αCys193), further emphasizing their major contribution to the α-Bgtx binding site. Interestingly, although biotinylation of position αV188C is not affected by the presence of α-Bgtx, erabutoxin a, which is a member of the short neurotoxin family, inhibits biotinylation at position αV188C, but not at αW187C or αF189C. Taken together, these results indicate that short and long neurotoxins establish interactions with distinct amino acids on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.

It is a pentameric protein composed of four subunit types in a molar ratio 2α:β:γ:δ (see Ref. 1.Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar for review). An important first step in assessing the structure and function of such ion channels at a molecular level is to determine their transmembrane topology. To address this issue, a variety of techniques have been developed (see Ref. 2.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar for review). The most commonly used methods are the epitope protection assay (3.Bennett J.A. Dingledine R. Neuron. 1995; 14: 373-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 4.Anand R. Bason L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The above methods, however, are only useful to assess overall topology of membrane proteins. For the nAChR, there is general consensus on the overall topology, although final proof will have to await high resolution structural data; each subunit possesses a large, extracellular amino-terminal domain, which is followed by four transmembrane-spanning regions and a short extracellular carboxyl terminus (9.Unwin N. Cell. 1993; 72: 31-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In contrast, the key structural issue of whether individual residues are solvent-exposed has not been resolved. To address this issue, Gallivan et al. (10.Gallivan J.P. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 739-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have recently employed the in vivo nonsense suppression technique to incorporate derivatives of the unnatural amino acid biocytin into the nAChR heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. By evaluating the binding of 125I-streptavidin to biotinylated receptors, they studied the surface exposure of individual residues comprising the main immunogenic region (spanning positions 67–76; Ref.11.Saedi M. Anand R. Conroy W. Lindstrom J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 267: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and showed that position α70 was highly exposed. In the current study, we have used the substituted cysteine accessibility method (12.Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 13.Stauffer D.A. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6840-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) to systematically map the accessibility of individual residues between positions 184 and 197 of the α-subunit, the main determinant for agonist and competitive antagonist binding to the nAChR (14.Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23521-23527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15.Machold J. Weise C. Utkin Y. Tsetlin V. Hucho F. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4912-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To achieve this, we have introduced cysteine residues into the nAChR and labeled them with thiol-reactive, water-soluble biotin derivatives. Subsequently, we precipitated biotinylated receptors with immobilized streptavidin and probed the immunoprecipitates by Western blotting. Previous studies of oocyte-expressed Cys substitution mutations of α-subunit residues 181–197 (17.McLaughlin J.T. Hawrot E. Yellen G. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) indicate that the majority of these substitutions are well tolerated and lead to minimal perturbations in receptor function. Here, we show that positions 184–197 are all amenable to biotinylation, suggesting that the entire region is surface-exposed. In addition, modifications with the uncharged biotin derivative occur with similar rates for all of these residues. Moreover, we demonstrate that preincubation with the competitive antagonist α-Bgtx, a long-chain α-neurotoxin, selectively blocks biotinylation of positions 187, 189, and cysteines 192 and 193 in reduced wild-type receptors, demonstrating the importance of these residues in the binding of α-Bgtx and further supporting results we obtained previously (16.Spura A. Russin T.S. Freedman N.D. Grant M. McLaughlin J.T. Hawrot E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4912-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In contrast, preincubation with Ea, a short-chain α-neurotoxin, yields a different footprint, preventing only position 188 and reduced wild-type receptors from biotinylation. Thus, our findings strongly argue that long- and short-chain α-neurotoxins interact selectively with different positions when blocking agonist binding on the nAChR. MTSEA-biotin was from Toronto Research. PEO-biotin and streptavidin-agarose beads were from Pierce, mAb 35 from Research Biochemicals International, and Protein G-agarose beads from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. We used a cytomegalovirus-based expression vector (GWI, British Biotechnology, Oxford, United Kingdom) to express the cDNAs for the α-, β-, γ-, and δ-subunits of the mouse muscle nicotinic AChR. Mutations were introduced using the Quikchange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's specifications. Mutations were confirmed by diagnostic restriction enzyme digests and bidirectional sequencing of the entire insert following a DyeDeoxy terminator protocol (Perkin-Elmer). These have been described previously (16.Spura A. Russin T.S. Freedman N.D. Grant M. McLaughlin J.T. Hawrot E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4912-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). MTSEDE-biotin belongs to a class of compound generally known as alkyl alkanethiolsulfonates. It was synthesized as follows (Fig.1). 2,2′-(Ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine) (38 g, 257 mmol) was dissolved in 40 ml of deionized water and 40 ml of dioxane. While this solution was stirring, di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (8 g, 36.7 mmol) dissolved in 80 ml of dioxane was added dropwise. Formation of the bis-Boc-protected product was discouraged by performing the dropwise addition at 0 °C. The reaction was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 6 h. The solvents were removed by rotary evaporation, and the product was dissolved in ethyl acetate and washed with saturated NaHCO3. The organic layers were dried over sodium carbonate, gravity-filtered, and rotary-evaporated to remove ethyl acetate. Flash chromatography using a 20% MeOH, 1% NH4OH, CH2Cl2 solvent system gave a 66% yield (6 g, 2.4 mmol) of a yellowish oil. The mono-Boc-protected diamine (0.38 g, 0.15 mmol) was dissolved in 8 ml of methanol. To this solution was added diisopropylethylamine (1.2 g, 0.9 mmol) and biotinN-hydroxysuccinimide ester (0.78 g, 0.2 mmol). The flask was stirred at room temperature for 4 h, concentrated by rotary evaporation, and redissolved in 50 ml of ethyl acetate. This solution was washed once with 10 ml HCl, once with 10 ml of NaHCO3, and once with brine. The organic layer was dried over magnesium sulfate, gravity-filtered through celite, and rotary-evaporated. Flash chromatography with an 8% MeOH/CH2Cl2 solvent system gives a 69% yield (0.5 g, 0.1 mmol) of a white solid. The Boc-protected biotin diamine (0.5 g, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in 4.9 ml of trifluoroacetic acid and stirred at room temperature for 20 min. The reaction flask was rotary-evaporated to remove trifluoroacetic acid, producing a brownish oil. This oil was dissolved in a few drops of deionized water and placed under vacuum to remove any remaining trifluoroacetic acid. Thin layer chromatography (15% MeOH/CH2Cl2) showed the product spot very close to the base line, suggesting that it contained the extremely polar free amine. The biotin diamine (0.06 g, 0.02 mmol) was dissolved in 2 ml of tetrahydrofuran and stirred at room temperature. To this solution, iodoacetic anhydride (0.17 g, 0.05 mmol) and diisopropylethylamine (0.12 g, 0.1 mmol) were added. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h, after which the flask was rotary evaporated to remove the tetrahydrofuran and placed under vacuum. Flash chromatography was performed using 10% MeOH/CH2Cl2 as the eluent, giving an 88% yield of an off-white solid (0.06 g, 0.01 mmol). The iodobiotin diamine (0.75 g, 1.4 mmol) was taken up in 10 ml of dimethylformamide (DMF). To this solution was added sodium methanethiolsulfonate (0.37 g, 0.003 mmol), and the reaction was allowed to stir at room temperature for 2 h. The flask was placed under high vacuum to remove the DMF, and the product was flash-chromatographed using a 15% MeOH/CH2Cl2solvent system. An 88% yield (0.64 g) of a yellowish oil was isolated. NMR spectra for MTSEDE-biotin and its intermediates were determined to confirm the purity of the product (data not shown) and are available upon request. Biotin (5.5 g, 22.6 mmol) was dissolved in 70 ml of DMF. To this solution was addedN-hydroxysuccinimide (3.12 g, 27.1 mmol) and diisopropyl carbodiimide (3.42 g, 27 mmol). The reaction was stirred at 90 °C overnight, after which rotary evaporation was used to remove DMF, giving a yellowish solid. Ethyl ether (150 ml) was added to the crude product to dissolve impurities, after which the crude solid was suction filtered. This off-white solid had a melting point range of 177–182 °C. The crude product was recrystallized in isopropanol and suction-filtered to give an 84.5% yield of a white solid (6.5 g, 19 mmol). The melting point of this solid was 200–202 °C. Sodium hydrosulfide was dried over P2O5 for 3 days. This dried sodium hydrosulfide (11 g, 20 mmol) was then dissolved in 150 ml of absolute ethanol. Methanesulfonyl chloride (11.4 g, 9.9 mmol) was added dropwise to this solution as it stirred at room temperature and under a nitrogen atmosphere. After all of the methanesulfonyl chloride had been added, the reaction was allowed to stir for another 2 h, under nitrogen. As nitrogen gas was bubbled through the reaction, it was forced through a drying tube and then bubbled through 2000 ml of bleach in order to neutralize the developing hydrogen sulfide gas. After 2 h, the reaction flask was heated to 65–70 °C for 1 h. The flask was allowed to cool, and then 100 ml of absolute ethanol were added before leaving the flask under nitrogen overnight. After this time, the solution was gravity-filtered to remove NaCl and then rotary-evaporated to remove ethanol. Recrystallization was performed with warm ethanol to yield a white solid with a melting point of 271.5 °C. The yield was 3.8 g (2.88 mmol). Iodoacetic acid (20 g, 107 mmol) was dissolved in 290 ml of ethyl acetate. Diisopropyl carbodiimide (6.8 g, 54 mmol) was added to this solution, and the reaction was stirred at room temperature for 1 h under nitrogen. IR spectroscopy showed that the reaction had gone to completion by the formation of two strong, sharp peaks at 1793.7 and 1735.6 cm−1 and the disappearance of a strong, broad peak at 3401.5 cm−1 (COOH peak). Ethyl acetate was removed by rotary evaporation, yielding a ruby red oil of iodoacetic anhydride. Two days after transfection, cells were harvested by gentle agitation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mmNa2-EDTA (∼0.5–1 × 107 cells obtained from one 75-cm2 tissue culture flask). After a brief centrifugation at ∼600 × g, the cells were resuspended in high potassium Ringer's solution (22.Sine S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6692-6699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), pooled, divided into 300-μl aliquots, and incubated for the specified times with 5–500 μm MTSEDE-biotin or PEO-biotin. For MTSEA-biotin, the reagent was dissolved in Me2SO instead of water before being added to the cells at 500 μm. For each biotin reagent, we added an excess of BrACh (1.5 mm) to terminate the reaction. The unbound biotin was removed by pelleting the cells (2 min at 20 °C), and resuspending the pellet in 0.5 ml of high potassium Ringer's. This wash was repeated three times in total. For preincubations with α-Bgtx or Ea, the cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 10 μm amounts of the respective toxin to allow for a saturation of binding sites. PEO-biotin was then added directly into the tubes for the times indicated. Typically, HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with wild-type AChR subunits yielded 50–100 fmol of biotinylated surface receptor/cm2 of confluent cells. After treatment with PEO-biotin, cells were lysed in 450 μl of ice-cold RIPA solution (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) with added proteinase inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μm benzamide) and incubated on ice for 15 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was precipitated with 50 μg of streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) at 4 °C overnight. Under these conditions, we found that the maximal amount of biotinylated receptor was precipitated, as the addition of larger volumes of beads did not lead to an increase in detectable α-subunit. The precipitated samples were washed three times with 500 μl of RIPA solution (4,000 × g, 2 min, 4 °C). Typically, lysed cells containing ∼1 mg of total protein were precipitated and the equivalent of ∼200 fmol of toxin binding sites was retrieved and loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels. To determine receptor surface expression, intact cells containing ∼1 mg of total protein were incubated with 5 μg of monoclonal anti-nAChR mAb 35 (11, 23) in a final volume of 500 μl of Ringer's solution for 90 min on ice. Subsequently, unbound antibody was removed by washing as above, cells were lysed with 450 μl of RIPA solution as above, and receptors were precipitated overnight using 50 μl of Protein G-agarose. The precipitated samples were washed three times with 500 μl of RIPA solution (4,000 × g, 2 min, 4 °C). The conditions chosen are saturating, as neither the addition of larger amounts of Protein G-agarose or mAb 35 nor the prolonged exposure with mAb 35 lead to an increased precipitation of α-subunit. Biotinylated receptor-streptavidin-agarose bead complexes (or Protein G-receptor complexes in the case of mAb 35-treated samples) were brought to a final concentration of 4% SDS, 0.002% bromphenol blue, 0.12 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 10% glycerol. Prior to loading, DTT and β-mercaptoethanol were added to a final concentration of 500 mm each. Samples were heated to 95 °C for 3 min before being loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (24.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206615) Google Scholar). The gels were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween and 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Primary antibody incubations were performed in the same buffer using a 1:500 dilution of antibody 43.37 (120 μg/ml stock) (25.Chase B.A. Holliday J. Reese J.H. Chun L.L. Hawrot E. Neuroscience. 1987; 3: 959-976Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Blots were then incubated with anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (working dilution 1:2500; Transduction Laboratories). Proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection method (ECL Plus, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Visualized receptor bands were quantitated by densitometry using the software ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). A calibration curve relating band intensities to femtomoles of ACh binding sites was established for mutant and wild-type receptors by running known concentrations of Torpedo membranes on a gel, followed by Western blotting, ECL exposure, and densitometry quantitation. These defined amounts of Torpedo membranes were run alongside with the biotinylated receptors and subjected to identical experimental conditions. Using these calibration curves, intensities of biotinylated receptor bands were then converted from pixel values to femtomoles of ACh binding sites for each time point. Rate constants for the biotinylation of AChR were then determined using a second-order rate equation (26.Sine S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 254: 3315-3325Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In cases where α-Bgtx or Ea led to a substantial inhibition (>10-fold), second-order reaction rates were estimated by comparing the maximal amounts of biotinylation in the absence or presence of the toxins for three PEO-biotin concentrations (5, 50, and 500 μm). In previous studies, we demonstrated that a cysteine can be substituted for all of the individual amino acids between positions 184 and 197 of the mouse muscle-type α-subunit without dramatic effect on receptor functionality (<6-fold changes in the EC50) as measured by ACh responsiveness in Xenopus oocytes (17.McLaughlin J.T. Hawrot E. Yellen G. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Moreover, we showed that within this region, residues Trp187, Val188, Phe189, Tyr190, and Pro194 are solvent-accessible and are in a position to contribute to the α-Bgtx binding site. In order to explore further the topology of the bracketing region extending from 184 to 197, we have now modified the appropriate Cys-substituted mutants with thiol-specific biotin derivatives following their expression in HEK-293 cells, permitting a more detailed analysis of the accessibility of these Cys-substituted residues. Initially, we wanted to determine whether alkyl methane thiosulfonate derivatives of biotin could be used to specifically modify surface-exposed cysteines in the nAChR. Previously, we and others showed that smaller alkyl methane thiosulfonate derivatives and bromoacetylcholine, an alkylammonium compound containing an α-haloacyl ester moiety, react covalently and specifically with Cys192 and Cys193 of the nAChR following their selective reduction with 1 mm DTT (16.Spura A. Russin T.S. Freedman N.D. Grant M. McLaughlin J.T. Hawrot E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4912-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 17.McLaughlin J.T. Hawrot E. Yellen G. Biochem.

Sarin V. Fox J.L. Lindstrom J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2839-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, when cells expressing the wild-type nAChR were selectively reduced at positions 192 and 193 with 1 mm DTT and then treated with 500 μm of MTSEDE-biotin (Fig. 2 A,lane 4), we detected a band corresponding to the α-subunit of the nAChR. As these studies were under way, a similar biotin derivative (PEO-biotin) became commercially available. When we applied this reagent to reduced wild-type receptors, we obtained results comparable to those for MTSEDE-biotin (Fig. 2 B,lane 4). Importantly, this band was not present when unreduced nAChR was exposed to MTSEDE-biotin (Fig. 2 A,lane 3) or PEO-biotin (Fig. 2 B,lane 3). Biotinylation was blocked by preincubation with either 1.5 mm BrACh or 1.5 mm MTSET for both MTSEDE- and PEO-biotin, confirming its specificity (Fig.3 B, lane 3; Fig. 5 A). In contrast, exposure of cells to the more hydrophobic MTSEA-biotin leads to considerable nonspecific labeling, as we detected α-subunit labeling that was equally pronounced both before and after reduction with DTT. These results suggest that this reagent is capable of penetrating the lipid bilayer to a large degree and may have access to the internal cysteines at position αCys222 (in presumed transmembrane segment M1) and αCys418 (M4) (compare Fig. 2 A,lanes 6 and 7). In addition, we observed that MTSEA-mediated biotinylation of reduced wild-type and mutant receptors cannot be blocked by 1.5 mm BrACh (data not shown), further pointing to its reactivity with an internal cysteine. For PEO- and MTSEDE-biotin, we detected nonspecific labeling of native unreduced receptors only when concentrations were raised to 1.5 mm and above (data not shown). The weak signal we obtained in the presence of DTT alone may suggest nonspecific absorption of the receptor to the streptavidin beads that are used for precipitation, although the result presented here was somewhat exceptional, and we generally did not observe a signal in the presence of DTT alone (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). Additionally, labeling of surface-expressed α-subunit by incubation of intact cells with the mouse monoclonal nAChR antibody, mAb 35 (11) (directed against region α67–76), followed by immunoprecipitation enabled us to the detect an α-band of an intensity comparable to that for the biotinylated wild-type receptor, indicating that at least a large fraction of the surface population of wild-type nAChRs can be biotinylated (Fig. 2 A, lane 5). However, it should be noted that a direct comparison of the signal intensities is not 100% accurate. Although we have optimized conditions such that maximal amounts of both mAb 35-labeled and biotinylated receptor are precipitated, it remains possible that the recovery of receptor eluted from the beads is different for the two methods. Nevertheless, we could use mAb 35 to test surface expression of all the cysteine mutants from position α184C to α197C, and we detected no noticeable difference in cell-surface expression levels among these mutants (Fig. 3 A).Figure 5Reactivity of mutant αV188C with PEO-biotin in the presence or absence of α-Bgtx. The αV188C mutant α-subunit encoding cDNA was transfected together with wild-type β-, γ-, and δ-subunits into HEK-293 cells, which were harvested after 2 days of incubation, and treated with PEO-biotin. The PEO-biotin concentration for all time points was 50 μm, unless otherwise stated in the figure. Streptavidin precipitation, electrophoresis, Western blotting, and visualization of the α-subunit were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.”A, biotinylation in the absence of α-Bgtx. Biotinylation was terminated by the addition of the thiol-specific BrACh (1.5 mm) at the indicated time points. Torpedomembranes (100 fmol in toxin binding sites) were loaded as a standard reference. For BrACh preincubation, the sample was exposed to 1.5 mm BrACh for 10 min at 20 °C, followed by three washes, prior to the addition of PEO-biotin. B, biotinylation in the presence of 10 μm α-Bgtx. Harvested cells were first incubated with 10 μm α-Bgtx for 2 h, and PEO-biotin was then added directly. For all samples in A andB, equal amounts of receptor (∼200 fmol of toxin binding sites) were modified and loaded onto each lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In an effort to quantitate the reactivity of reduced wild-type and mutant nAChRs with PEO-biotin, we exposed nAChRs to 5 μm PEO-biotin for various incubation times (Fig. 4 A). Second-order reaction rates were calculated as described under “Materials and Methods.” For reduced wild receptors, we obtained a rate constant of 103.6m−1 s−1(Table I). Comparable results were obtained with MTSEDE-biotin (data not shown). However, since the MTS compound was more light-sensitive and degraded rapidly at room temperature, we focused the remainder of our studies exclusively on the effects mediated by PEO-biotin.Table ISecond-order reaction rates of mutant α-subunits with PEO-biotinMutantSecond-order reaction rate kRatiok/k Bgtxm −1 s −1αD71C39.5 ± 5.10.98 ± 0.03Reduced wild-type (α192/193)103.6 ± 3.4>100αW184C41.3 ± 3.90.89 ± 0.08αK185C23.5 ± 3.11.1 ± 0.05αH186C28.3 ± 3.50.91 ± 0.09αW187C10.8 ± 0.9>10αV188C101.9 ± 12.81.34 ± 0.07αF189C93.7 ± 9.6>100αY190C55.6 ± 13.30.86 ± 0.07αS191C37.1 ± 1.90.88 ± 0.05αP194C21.1 ± 3.21.36 ± 0.09αT195C36.8 ± 4.40.98 ± 0.05αT196C59.3 ± 3.30.96 ± 0.06αP197C47.6 ± 9.41.21 ± 0.11Wild-type or the respective mutant α-subunits encoding cDNAs were transfected together with wild-type β-, γ-, and δ-subunits into HEK-293 cells, which were harvested after 2 days of incubation, and treated with PEO-biotin. Streptavidin precipitation, electrophoresis, Western blotting and visualization of the α-subunit and calculation of second-order reaction rates were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Second-order reaction rate constants in the absence (k) and presence of α-Bgtx (k Bgtx) were determined using 50 μmPEO-biotin for all of the mutants, except for mutant αW187C (500 μm) and reduced wild-type receptors (5 μm). Positions 192 and 193 form a vicinal disulfide bond in the wild-type receptor and are not listed separately, since they are indistinguishable and become modified in PEO-biotin-exposed reduced wild-type receptors. In cases where α-Bgtx led to a blockade of the second-order reaction rate with PEO-biotin, only estimates of the maximal rates of biotinylation in the presence of α-Bgtx could be calculated, due to nonspecific labeling at high concentrations of PEO-biotin. The reduction in the rate of reactivity was estimated by comparing the intensities obtained for 10-min incubations with 5, 50, and 500 μm biotin in the presence and absence of the α-Bgtx.

https://openalex.org/W2034468123,"In the P2-type ATPases, there is growing evidence that four α-helical stalk segments connect the cytoplasmic part of the molecule, responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis, to the membrane-embedded part that mediates cation transport. The present study has focused on stalk segment 4, which displays a significant degree of sequence conservation among P2-ATPases. When site-directed mutants in this region of the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase were constructed and expressed in secretory vesicles, more than half of the amino acid substitutions led to a severalfold decrease in the rate of ATP hydrolysis, although they had little or no effect on the coupling between hydrolysis and transport. Strikingly, mutant ATPases bearing single substitutions of 13 consecutive residues from Ile-359 through Gly-371 were highly resistant to inorganic orthovanadate, with IC50 values at least 10-fold above those seen in the wild-type enzyme. Most of the same mutants also displayed a significant reduction in the K m for MgATP and an increase in the pH optimum for ATP hydrolysis. Taken together, these changes in kinetic behavior point to a shift in equilibrium from the E2 conformation of the ATPase toward the E1conformation. The residues from Ile-359 through Gly-371 would occupy three full turns of an α-helix, suggesting that this portion of stalk segment 4 may provide a conformationally active link between catalytic sites in the cytoplasm and cation-binding sites in the membrane.

In the most abundant subfamily, designated P2, the 100-kDa ATPase polypeptide is embedded in the lipid bilayer by four hydrophobic segments at the N-terminal end of the molecule and six at the C-terminal end (1.Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The central hydrophilic region protrudes into the cytoplasm and contains catalytic sites for ATP binding and formation of the characteristic β-aspartyl phosphate intermediate. It was proposed more than a decade ago that conformational changes in the catalytic portion of the P-type ATPases are transmitted into the membrane via a stalk-like region made up of the cytoplasmic extensions from some, but not necessarily all, of the transmembrane segments (2.MacLennan D.H. Brandl C.J. Korczak B. Green N.M. Nature. 1985; 316: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Recently, the stalk has been directly visualized in cryoelectron microscopic studies of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (3.Zhang P. Toyoshima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and the plasma membrane H+-ATPase of Neurospora crassa (4.Auer M. Scarborough G.A. Kuhlbrandt W. Nature. 1998; 392: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), both at 8-Å resolution. In the case of the Ca2+-ATPase, the stalk appeared as a narrow structure connecting the compact, wedge-shaped cytoplasmic domain with the membrane-spanning segments; it contained four rod-like densities (very likely α-helices), which were tentatively identified as stalk segments 2–5 (3.Zhang P. Toyoshima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). TheNeurospora H+-ATPase was strikingly similar to the Ca2+-ATPase in its membrane region, but the cytoplasmic portion was noticeably less compact, and instead of a single stalk, there were several apparent connections between the cytoplasmic portion and the membrane (4.Auer M. Scarborough G.A. Kuhlbrandt W. Nature. 1998; 392: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). As the authors pointed out (3.Zhang P. Toyoshima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 4.Auer M. Scarborough G.A. Kuhlbrandt W. Nature. 1998; 392: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 5.Stokes D.L. Auer M. Zhang P. Kuhlbrandt W. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the two structures may represent different conformational states, since the Ca2+-ATPase was crystallized in the presence of decavanadate and the H+-ATPase, in the absence of added ligands. Indeed, there is compelling evidence that the reaction cycle of the P-ATPases alternates between two major conformations (E1 and E2), that are different enough to be distinguished from one another by a variety of biochemical and biophysical methods (6.Jorgensen P.L. Andersen J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 103: 95-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) including proteolytic digestion patterns (7.Addison R. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 26426-26431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) carried out an informative mutagenesis study of stalk segments 2 and 3 in the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase, a close relative of theNeurospora enzyme. Their approach was to replace selected amino acids in S2 (Ile-183 and Gly-186) and S3 (Gly-270 and Thr-287) with helix-breaking residues, Gly and Pro, in order to test the helical nature of S2 and S3. At both positions in S2, the mutations proved to be lethal; at the positions in S3, the cells were viable, but the Pro replacements led to a significant reduction in ATPase activity. The authors concluded that the α-helical nature of S2, and to a lesser extent that of S3, may help to stabilize the stalk and/or promote the proper conformational interaction between the cytoplasmic and membrane-embedded portions of the ATPase. In the present study, we have performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis along the entire length of S4, again in the yeast H+-ATPase. S4 almost certainly contributes to the stalk structure seen by cryoelectron microscopy, and it links the Asp residue that is phosphorylated by ATP to membrane segment 4 (M4). M4 in turn plays a central role in cation binding and translocation, based on mutagenesis studies of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (11.Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2740-2745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Consistent with this picture, the mutagenesis results to be described below provide evidence that stalk segment 4 helps to mediate the E1/E2 conformational change in the yeast H+-ATPase. Strain SY4 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (MATa, ura3-52, leu2-3, 112, his4-619, sec6-4 ts GAL2, pma1::YIpGAL-PMA1) was used throughout in this study. In strain SY4, the chromosomal copy of the PMA1 gene encoding the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase has been placed under control of the GAL1 promoter as described previously (22.Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SY4 also carries the temperature-sensitive sec6-4 mutation which, upon incubation at 37 °C, blocks the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane (23.Novick P. Field C. Schekman R. Cell. 1980; 21: 205-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). To introduce mutations into the S4 region of the H+-ATPase by polymerase chain reaction (24.Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar), two restriction fragments of the PMA1 gene were employed, both subcloned into a modified Bluescript plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutations from Lys-355 to Ala-370 were introduced into a 615-base pair BstEII/EcoRI restriction fragment, whereas mutations from Gly-371 to Leu-375 were introduced into a 495-base pairStyI/BamHI fragment. After DNA sequencing to verify the mutation, the restriction fragment was moved into plasmid PMA1.2 (22.Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 3.8-kilobase pair HindIII/SacI fragment containing the entire pma1-coding region was then cloned into the yeast expression vector YCp2HSE (22.Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), placing the mutant allele under control of two tandemly arranged heat-shock elements. Finally, the plasmids were transformed into yeast strain SY4 (see above) according to the method of Ito et al. (25.Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformed SY4 cells were grown to mid-exponential phase (A 600 ∼1) at 23 °C in supplemented minimal medium containing 2% galactose, shifted to medium containing 2% glucose for 3 h, and then heat-shocked at 39 °C for an additional 2 h. The cells were harvested and washed, and secretory vesicles were isolated and suspended in 0.8 m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm triethanolamine/acetic acid, pH 7.2, as described previously (26.Ambesi A. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 127-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To determine the level of expressed PMA1 protein, secretory vesicles (5–20 μg) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted. Quantitative PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad) analysis was carried out at two protein concentrations within the linear range, and the expression level was calculated from the average of two or more determinations. Unless otherwise noted, ATP hydrolysis was assayed at 30 °C in 0.5 ml of 50 mmMES1/Tris, pH 5.7, 5 mm KN3, 5 mm Na2ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and an ATP-regenerating system (5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 50 μg/ml pyruvate kinase). The reaction was terminated after 20–40 min, and the release of inorganic phosphate from ATP was determined by the method of Fiske and Subbarow (27.Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Specific activity was calculated as the difference between ATP hydrolysis in the absence and in the presence of 100 μmsodium orthovanadate, a potent inhibitor of P-type ATPases. IC50 values for vanadate inhibition were determined by measuring ATP hydrolysis in the presence of increasing concentrations of vanadate. For determination of K m values, Na2ATP was varied between 0.15 and 7.5 mm with MgCl2 always in excess of ATP by 5 mm; actual concentrations of MgATP were calculated by the method of Fabiato and Fabiato (28.Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the pH optimum for ATP hydrolysis, the pH of the assay media was adjusted to values between 5.2 and 7.5 with Tris base. ATP hydrolysis was also assayed under conditions similar to that used for quantitation of proton transport (see below), as described previously (29.Ambesi A. Pan R.L. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, secretory vesicles (5–10 μg of protein) were diluted into 200 μl of 0.6 m sorbitol, 0.1m KCl, 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 6.7, Na2ATP (0.3 to 3.0 mm), and MgCl2(5 mm excess over the ATP concentration) at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped after 20–40 min by addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 5%, and inorganic phosphate was determined. ATP-dependent proton transport was assayed by measuring the initial rate of acridine orange fluorescence quenching as described previously (29.Ambesi A. Pan R.L. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The specific initial rate of quenching was adjusted for the level of ATPase expression and reported as a percentage of the wild-type rate. In order to examine the coupling of proton transport to ATP hydrolysis, the initial rate of fluorescence quenching was determined over a range of ATP concentrations and plotted as a function of the rate of ATP hydrolysis, assayed under similar conditions (see above). Limited trypsinolysis was performed on isolated secretory vesicles as described previously (30.Dutra M.B. Ambesi A. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 17411-17417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Vesicles were suspended at 0.5 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 5 mm MgCl2. Following preincubation at 30 °C for 5 min in the presence of 0, 1, 10, or 100 μmorthovanadate, tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin was added (trypsin/protein ratio of 1:4), and the incubation was continued for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and the products were analyzed by immunoblotting with polyclonal antiserum against the ATPase. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (31.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as modified by Ambesi et al. (26.Ambesi A. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 127-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin as standard. The goal of the present study was to explore the functional role of amino acid residues throughout stalk segment 4 (S4), which links membrane segment 4 (M4) with the phosphorylation site (Asp-378) of the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase (Fig. 1). Residues from Lys-355 to Leu-375 were subjected to alanine-scanning mutagenesis, filling in the 21-amino acid stretch between previously published studies of M4 (Tyr-325 through Ala-354; Ref. 29.Ambesi A. Pan R.L. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and the phosphorylation domain (Cys-376 through Thr-384; Refs. 32.Rao R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21744-21751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). With the exception of Ala-358, Ala-365, and Ala-370, which were replaced with Ser, each residue was changed to Ala. Each mutant allele was cloned into the expression vector YCp-2HSE, transformed into yeast strain SY4, and expressed under the control of a heat-shock promoter after turning off the wild-type PMA1 allele (22.Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Secretory vesicles containing newly synthesized mutant ATPase were then isolated and characterized (26.Ambesi A. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 127-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As summarized in TableI (top part), quantitative immunoblotting revealed that Ala/Ser substitutions in S4 had only a modest effect on biogenesis, with mutant H+-ATPases reaching the secretory vesicles at 35–101% of the amount seen in the wild-type control. Likewise, 19 of 21 mutant enzymes clearly retained the ability to hydrolyze ATP, with specific activities ranging from 27 to 118% after correction for the level of expression in the vesicles. Only two of the mutants showed more serious defects in ATP hydrolysis as follows: L369A (12%) and I374A (16%), and even in these cases, the uncorrected activities were 4–5-fold greater than the background values measured in the empty plasmid control. Thus, none of the residues in S4 appeared to be completely essential for ATP hydrolysis, although most of the mutations caused at least a 50% decrease in the rate of hydrolysis.Table IEffect of mutations in stalk segment 4 on expression, ATP hydrolysis, and proton transportMutationExpression aThe amount of mutant H+-ATPase in isolated secretory vesicles was determined by quantitative immunoblotting and calculated as a percent of the wild-type control (30).ATP hydrolysis bVanadate-sensitive ATP hydrolysis was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” One unit is defined as 1 μmol of Pi/min.

Corrections for expression have not been made for mutants with measured ATPase activities below 4% of the wild-type control. Open table in a new tab Given that S4 physically links the phosphorylated Asp residue to the membrane, it was important to examine the effects of the Ala/Ser substitutions on the ability of the ATPase to transport protons. This was measured by fluorescence quenching of the pH-sensitive dye, acridine orange (Table I, top part). In four of the mutants (K356A, L369A, I374A, and L375A), ATP-dependent quenching was clearly above background, but the activities were so low that quantitative determinations were not possible. In one mutant (E367A), the initial rate of proton transport (83% of wild type) appeared to exceed the rate of ATP hydrolysis (46% of wild type). Closer examination of this mutant seemed warranted, given the fact that Glu-367 is strongly conserved among P2-ATPases (see Fig. 1). When proton transport was measured over a range of ATP concentrations, however, and the initial rates were plotted as a function of ATP hydrolysis assayed under the same conditions, the data for E367A (like the data for three other mutants) proved to be very similar to the wild-type control (Fig.2). It later became obvious that the discrepancy in Table I could be accounted for by the abnormal pH optimum of the E367A ATPase (see legend to Fig. 2 and below). For all of the remaining mutants, the initial rate of ATP-dependent quenching closely paralleled that of ATP hydrolysis (Table I), suggesting that the substitutions had little or no effect on the coupling between transport and hydrolysis. Each of the mutant ATPases was next examined for changes in sensitivity to inorganic orthovanadate, an inhibitor that binds tightly to the E2 conformation of P-type ATPases. Here, a striking result was obtained; of the 21 mutants studied, 9 showed a very significant degree of vanadate resistance, with IC50 values above 10 μm (TableII, top part). The resistant mutations began at position 360 and continued (with interruptions) through position 374. Upon closer inspection of this region, it was apparent that 4 of the 6 mutants still sensitive to vanadate carried substitutions of Ser for Ala or Ala for Ser. Because a less conservative substitution at one of these positions (S368F) had previously been shown to produce a highly vanadate-resistant enzyme (34.Harris S.L. Perlin D.S. Seto-Young D. Haber J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24439-24445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it seemed worthwhile to make further replacements of Ser-364, Ala-365, and Ala-370. To define the ends of the region, Ile-359, Val-372, and Glu-373 were also included.Table IIKinetic properties of stalk 4 mutantsMutationIC50(Van) aVan, vanadate.K m(MgATP)pH optimumμmmmAlanine scan Wild type1.81.55.7 K355A3.21.55.7 K356A4.31.05.7 Q357A4.01.15.4 A358S1.51.35.7 I359A1.61.35.7 V360A12.61.05.7 Q361A10.40.85.7 K362A15.30.95.4 L363A18.40.76.0 S364A2.91.05.7 A365S0.90.95.7 I366A376.50.36.0 E367A22.70.26.1 S368A0.90.75.9 L369A17.20.45.4 A370S1.10.75.8 G371A24.61.45.7 V372A5.71.25.4 E373A2.10.56.0 I374A17.70.65.7 L375A5.00.75.7Additional substitutions I359F10.40.35.4 S364D17.80.55.4 S364E6.60.85.7 S364F3.40.85.9 S364K4.30.16.3 S364L1.80.46.0 S364R4.00.16.3 S365F13.20.75.7 A365L54.10.65.7 A370F43.00.16.3 E373F2.50.46.2a Van, vanadate. Open table in a new tab Among the additional mutants that were tested, all but one (V372F) were expressed in secretory vesicles at 43% or more of the wild-type level, and all but two (A370L and V372F) had measurable rates of ATP hydrolysis (Table I, bottom part). Furthermore, for every mutant with sufficient activity to be assayed, there was a close correspondence between the initial rate of ATP hydrolysis and the initial rate of ATP-dependent proton transport (Table I), indicating that these substitutions (like the initial set described above) had little or no effect on the coupling between hydrolysis and transport. In five of the additional mutants (I359F, S364D, A365F, A365L, and A370F), the IC50 value for vanadate rose above 10 μm (Table II, bottom part), confirming that substantial vanadate resistance could be observed at these positions as well. The distribution of resistance along S4 is illustrated in Fig.3 A, which demonstrates that the 13-amino acid stretch from Ile-359 through Gly-371 can undergo mutations that elevate the IC50 more than 5-fold above the wild-type value. In previous mutagenesis studies of the yeast H+-ATPase, vanadate resistance has frequently been accompanied by a reduction in the apparent K mvalue for MgATP and a rise in pH optimum (29.Ambesi A. Pan R.L. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 30.Dutra M.B. Ambesi A. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 17411-17417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This “coordinated” phenotype has been interpreted as a shift in equilibrium from the vanadate-sensitive E2 conformation toward the E1 conformation, where MgATP and the transported proton are expected to bind with higher affinity than in E2. In the present study, 6 of the 14 vanadate-resistant mutants in the stalk 4 region (I359F, S364D, I366A, E367A, L369A, and A370F) displayed K m values of 0.5 mm or lower, representing at least a 3-fold change from the value seen in the wild-type control; six additional mutants (Q361A, K362A, L363A, A365F, A365L, and I374A) gave smaller but reproducible reductions to 0.6–0.9 mm (Table II). Thus, a strong but not complete correlation could be seen between vanadate resistance and a decreasedK m for MgATP (Fig. 3 B). Not surprisingly, given the many ways in which the pH dependence of the H+-ATPase might be altered, the situation was less clear-cut with regard to pH optimum. Four of the vanadate-resistant mutants (L363A, I366A, E367A, and A370F) displayed a conspicuous alkaline shift of 0.3 to 0.6 pH units (Table II). The rest retained an essentially normal pH optimum, except for a few with a minor shift in the acid direction (e.g. K362A). If the cluster of kinetic changes seen in many of the stalk 4 mutants reflects a shift in equilibrium from the vanadate-sensitive E2 conformation toward the vanadate-insensitive E1 conformation, it should be possible to detect the shift by limited trypsinolysis (29.Ambesi A. Pan R.L. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 30.Dutra M.B. Ambesi A. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 17411-17417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the experiment of Fig.4, secretory vesicles were incubated with trypsin for 20 min in the presence of 0, 1, 10, or 100 μmvanadate. The reaction was stopped by the addition of diisopropyl fluorophosphate (1 mm), and the digestion products were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with anti-PMA1 antibody. Under the conditions of the experiment, the wild-type ATPase displayed significant protection by vanadate, with the accumulation of 97-, 70-, and 60-kDa fragments. By contrast, the fragments were barely visible in E367A and not seen at all in I366A, consistent with the idea that the mutant enzymes had difficulty reaching the vanadate-protectable E2 conformation. This study reports an impressive stretch of 13 consecutive vanadate-resistant mutations in stalk segment 4 of the yeast PMA1 H+-ATPase. While similar mutations have been described previously for the yeast ATPase (29.Ambesi A. Pan R.L. Slayman C.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 581-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), they have been scattered throughout the 100-kDa polypeptide, with no discernible structural or functional pattern (Fig.5). The cluster in S4 therefore deserves special interest. At the structural level, S4 is customarily depicted as an α-helix, acting with three other stalk helices to connect the cytoplasmic and membrane-embedded portions of the ATPase. Evidence for the α-helical nature of S4 came originally from the use of standard algorithms (as reviewed in Ref. 38.MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) and has since been reinforced by cryoelectron microscopy of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, where an α-helical backbone was found to fit comfortably into each of four rod-like densities within the stalk region (5.Stokes D.L. Auer M. Zhang P. Kuhlbrandt W. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Significantly, however, the residues represented by the vanadate-resistant mutants from Ile-359 through Gly-371 would not be restricted to one face of such a helix; instead, they would occupy three full turns near the middle of S4. Functionally, it seems likely that the mutations cause a shift in E1-E2 equilibrium toward the vanadate-insensitive E1 conformation, given the fact that most of them display coordinated changes in the K mvalue for MgATP and the pH optimum of the H+-ATPase. In an earlier paper (29.Ambesi A. Pan R.L. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we described three similar mutants, spaced at intervals along transmembrane segment M4 (I332A, V336A, and V341A). Likewise, Blostein and co-workers (39.Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 40.Boxenbaum N.

Chem. 1998; 273: 23086-23092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have pointed out that a shift in E1-E2 equilibrium could explain the kinetic behavior of two Na+,K+-ATPase mutants: E233K, located in the M2-M3 cytoplasmic loop (39.Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 40.Boxenbaum N. Daly S.E. Javaid Z.Z. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23086-23092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and α1M32, a deletion mutant lacking 32 amino acids at the N terminus. In both mutants, vanadate resistance was accompanied by a decrease in theK m value for MgATP and by marked K+activation of Na-ATPase activity at micromolar ATP concentrations, a condition under which the E2(K) to E1 step is normally rate-limiting. The concentration of E1-E2 mutants in stalk segment 4 of the yeast H+-ATPase suggests that S4 may provide a critical, conformationally mobile link between the cytoplasmic phosphorylation site and cation-binding sites in the membrane. Independent evidence for this idea has come from mutagenesis studies by Inesi and co-workers (41.Zhang Z. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Summers S. Klein M.G. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16283-16290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on stalk segment 4 of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase. Here, single substitutions of conserved S4 residues significantly slowed the rate of ATP hydrolysis and Ca2+ uptake, even though measurable levels of phosphorylated intermediate were formed (41.Zhang Z. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Summers S. Klein M.G. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16283-16290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Single substitutions of non-conserved residues were less damaging, but multiple substitutions of such residues interfered with the Ca2·E1P to Ca2·E2transition (as reflected by the rate of phosphoenzyme turnover) and the E1 to E2 transition (as reflected by the time course of EGTA inactivation, Ref. 42.Garnett C. Sumbilla C. Belda F.F. Chen L. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11019-11025Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, once again it seems likely that stalk 4 has a profound influence on rate-limiting conformational transitions. To visualize the way in which S4 performs this function, high resolution structures for both the E1 and E2conformations will be required. Reporter groups engineered into specific locations along S4 will also help to track the conformational changes; studies along these lines are presently under way in several laboratories including our own."
https://openalex.org/W2069991641,"Identification of the transcriptionally activated targets of receptor tyrosine kinases is critical to understanding biologic programs directing both normal and neoplastic growth. To elucidate these molecular processes, we identified genes induced by a potent mesenchymal mitogen, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Using differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technology, we isolated a novel growth factor-induced cDNA, <i>San5. San5</i> transcript induction occurred within 60 min in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and proceeded in the presence of cycloheximide. Maximal induction of the <i>San5</i> transcript occurred between 8 and 16 h, concurrent with passage of fibroblasts through G<sub>1</sub>. <i>San5</i> message was potently induced by PDGF AA and BB and acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors, all strong activators of fibroblast proliferation, but not by epidermal growth factor and interleukin-4. In a murine hematopoietic progenitor cell line, <i>San5</i> transcript induction strictly correlated with [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine uptake. Isolation and sequencing of the murine <i>San5</i> cDNA revealed amino acid sequence homology to yeast Nop5p, a nucleolar protein required for pre-rRNA processing and ribosome assembly. Strikingly, SAN5 was able to rescue a <i>nop5</i> null mutant, implicating SAN5 in the process of ribosome biogenesis. Consistent with this result, SAN5 was localized to the nucleolus in both yeast and mouse. Thus, <i>San5</i> may provide a link between growth factor receptor activation and the cellular translational machinery."
