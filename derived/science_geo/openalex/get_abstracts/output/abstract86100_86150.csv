https://openalex.org/W2072558376,"We report the isolation of cDNA clones for fibronectin from a rat liver library prepared in the expression vector, lambda gt11. Restriction mapping and DNA sequencing of these clones establish the sequence of the C-terminal 35% of rat fibronectin, covering the cell-, heparin-, and fibrin-binding domains. The cell- and heparin-binding regions have homologous repeating sequences. Based on the sequence data and S1 nuclease mapping, we conclude that there are at least three different fibronectin mRNAs in rat liver which differ in coding potential. The three RNAs appear to arise by alternative splicing within the coding region and are probably all encoded by a single gene. The implications of these results for the structure and function of fibronectin and the differences between various types of fibronectin are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2064345521,"Glucocorticoid receptor protein stimulates transcription initiation within murine mammary tumor virus (MTV) DNA sequences in vivo, and interacts selectively with MTV DNA in vitro. We mapped and compared five regions of MTV DNA that are bound specifically by purified receptor; one resides upstream of the transcription start site, and the others are distributed within transcribed sequences between 4 and 8 kb from the initiation site. Each region contains at least two strong binding sites for receptor, which itself appears to be a tetramer of 94,000 dalton hormone-binding subunits. Three of the five binding regions contain nine nuclease footprints that lack extensive homology, although a family of related octanucleotides can be discerned. Receptor interacts with the different regions with similar efficiencies, suggesting that receptor affinity for upstream and internal regions may differ by less than one order of magnitude. Moreover, each region appears to be bound independent of the others. A restriction fragment containing four footprint sequences from one of the regions has previously been shown to act in vivo as a receptor-dependent transcriptional enhancer element, implying that the binding sites detected in vitro may be biologically functional."
https://openalex.org/W1555798239,"Using the P4 unknotting assay, DNA topoisomerase II has been purified from several mammalian cells. Similar to prokaryotic DNA gyrase, mammalian DNA topoisomerase II can cleave double-stranded DNA and be trapped as a covalent protein-DNA complex. This cleavage reaction requires protein denaturant treatment of the topoisomerase II-DNA complex and is reversible with respect to salt and temperature. The product after reversal of the cleavage reaction remains supertwisted, suggesting that the two ends of the putatively broken DNA are held tightly by the topoisomerase. Alternatively, the enzyme-DNA interaction is noncovalent, and the covalent linking of topoisomerase to DNA is induced by the protein denaturant. Detailed characterization of the cleavage products has revealed that topoisomerase II cuts DNA with a four-base stagger and is covalently linked to the protruding 5'-phosphoryl ends of each broken DNA strand. Calf thymus DNA topoisomerase II cuts SV40 DNA at multiple and specific sites. However, no sequence homology has been found among the cleavage sites as determined by direct nucleotide-sequencing studies."
https://openalex.org/W1587595704,"In human fibroblasts, the receptor for low density lipoprotein (LDL) is synthesized as a precursor of apparent Mr = 120,000 which is converted to a mature form of apparent Mr = 160,000, as determined by migration in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels (Tolleshaug, H., Goldstein, J. L., Schneider, W. J., and Brown, M. S. (1982) Cell 30, 715-724). The current paper describes the relationship of N- and O-glycosylation to this post-translational modification. Oligosaccharides were analyzed from precursor and mature forms of LDL receptors that had been immunoprecipitated from cells grown in media containing radioactive sugars. In human epidermoid carcinoma A-431 cells, the receptor precursor appears to contain one N-linked high mannose oligosaccharide and approximately 6-9 N-acetylgalactosamine residues linked O-glycosidically to Ser/Thr residues. In the mature receptor, the O-linked oligosaccharides are mono- and disialylated species having the core structure of galactose leads to N-acetylgalactosamine leads to Ser/Thr. The single N-linked oligosaccharide of the mature receptor can either be a tri- or tetraantennary complex-type species. Similar results were obtained with normal human fibroblast receptor except that the O-linked oligosaccharides on the precursor are neutral disaccharides, of which one component is GalNAc and the N-linked complex type unit on the mature receptor is less branched. Since the addition of GalNAc residues to Ser/Thr residues precedes the conversion of N-linked high mannose-type oligosaccharides to complex-type structures, the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine must occur prior to the entry of glycoproteins into the region of the Golgi containing the processing enzyme alpha-mannosidase I. We also studied the receptor from tunicamycin-treated cells and after treatment with neuraminidase. In addition, we analyzed the receptor synthesized by a lectin-resistant clone of Chinese hamster ovary cells that is deficient in adding galactose residues to both N- and O-linked oligosaccharides. These studies suggest that the apparent differences in molecular weight between the precursor and mature forms of the LDL receptor are largely, if not entirely, due to the addition of sialic acid and galactose residues to the O-linked GalNAc residues.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1996238942,"The AtT-20 cell line, derived from the mouse anterior pituitary, synthesizes an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) precursor, proteolytically processes it to mature ACTH, stores it in secretory granules, and releases mature ACTH on stimulation with a secretagogue. A cDNA for human proinsulin inserted downstream from the SV40 early promoter in an SV40-pBR322 recombinant vector was introduced into AtT-20 cells. The stably transformed cell line, AtT-20ins4b/1, stores immunoreactive insulin, proteolytically processes proinsulin to smaller fragments, and on stimulation with secretagogues releases insulin-like material, not proinsulin, into the medium. Similarly transformed fibroblast L-cells secrete only proinsulin; they do not store it, and their secretion rate is unaffected by secretagogues. The transport mechanism for precursor ACTH thus appears to recognize other prohormones."
https://openalex.org/W1485546348,"The early actions of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) have been studied in hormone-responsive clonal GH3 rat pituitary cells. Previous studies had demonstrated that TRH promotes a response in which increased incorporation of [32P]orthophosphate into phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidic acid was observed within minutes of hormone addition. The studies described here were designed to establish whether increased labeling of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidic acid resulted from prior hormone-induced breakdown of an inositol phosphatide. GH3 cells were prelabeled with [32P]orthophosphate or myo-[3H]inositol. Addition of TRH resulted in the rapid disappearance of labeled polyphosphoinositides, whereas levels of phosphatidylinositol and other phospholipids remained unchanged. TRH-promoted polyphosphoinositide breakdown was evident by 5 S and maximal by 15 s of hormone treatment. Concomitant appearance of inositol polyphosphates in [3H]inositol-labeled cells was observed. In addition, TRH rapidly stimulated diacylglycerol accumulation in either [3H]arachidonic- or [3H]oleic acid-labeled cultures. These results indicate that TRH rapidly causes activation of a polyphosphoinositide-hydrolyzing phospholipase C-type enzyme. The short latency of this hormone effect suggests a proximal role for polyphosphoinositide breakdown in the sequence of events by which TRH alters pituitary cell function."

https://openalex.org/W2024116262,"The mRNA coding for the Sendai virus P and C proteins was located on the viral genome using cloned DNA and the relevant regions of the DNA were sequenced. The nucleotide sequence revealed two overlapping open reading frames that could code for proteins of 568 and 204 amino acids. Primer extension and S1 nuclease mapping studies detected only a single 1.894 kb mRNA from this region. Hybrid arrest of translation studies using restriction fragments verified the overlapping nature of these genes. Sequence homologies at the beginning of three Sendai virus cistrons suggest that these genes may have arisen by duplication from a common ancestor, possibly an influenza-like virus gene."
https://openalex.org/W1970634297,"Human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), American PL isolate, was transmitted by cocultivation and by cell-free filtrates to a nonlymphoid human osteogenic sarcoma (HOS) cell line, designated HOS/PL, but not to nine other lines bearing receptors for HTLV. HOS and HOS/PL cells are not dependent on interleukin-2 and do not express interleukin-2 receptors that are recognized by anti-Tac monoclonal antibody. HTLV released by the Japanese MT2 cell line was also transmitted to HOS cells. The infected HOS cells release substantial titers of progeny HTLV which is antigenically indistinguishable from parental virus and is able to transform T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1983969012,"We have examined the conformation of DNA cloned from the hypersensitive region 5′ of the chicken adult β-globin gene, in order to determine whether the unusual sensitivity to nucleases is related to altered secondary structure of the DNA. The region contains a large number of sites for methylation; we have studied the effect of methylation at Hpall sites on the topological properties of a small plasmid containing the region. We find that methylation does not alter the supercoiling properties of the plasmid under a wide variety of conditions; we find no evidence for conversion of any measurable segment of DNA to the Z conformation, even at high superhelix densities. We have also devised a protocol for mapping precisely the sites sensitive to S1 nuclease. The data are not consistent with the presence of cruciform structures. They reveal, however, a major cutting site located within a tract of 16 consecutive deoxyguanosine residues in the center of the hypersensitive region. Susceptibility to cutting is dependent upon supercoiling, but methylation at Hpall sequences has no effect on the S1 cutting pattern."

https://openalex.org/W1509366823,"Protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas testosteroni has been purified to homogeneity and crystallized. The iron containing, extradiol dioxygenase is shown to be composed of two subunit types (alpha, Mr = 17,700 and beta, Mr = 33,800) in a 1:1 ratio; such a composition has not been observed for other extradiol dioxygenases. The 4.2 K Mossbauer spectrum of native protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase prepared from cells grown in 57Fe-enriched media consists of a doublet with quadrupole splitting, delta EQ = 2.22 mm/s, and isomer shift delta Fe = 1.28 mm/s, demonstrating a high spin Fe2+ site. These parameters, and the temperature dependence of delta EQ, are unique among enzymes but are strikingly similar to those reported for the reaction center of the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides R-26, suggesting very similar ligand environments. The Fe2+ of protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase can be oxidized, for instance by H2O2, to yield high spin Fe3+ with EPR g values around g = 6 (and g = 4.3). In the oxidized state, protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase is inactive; the iron, however, can be rereduced by ascorbate to yield active enzyme. Our data suggest that protocatechuate binds to Fe2+; the spectra indicate that the ligand binding is heterogenous. The Mossbauer spectra observed here are fundamentally different from those reported earlier (Zabinski, R., Munck, E., Champion, P., and Wood, J. M. (1972) Biochemistry 11, 3212-3219). The spectra of the earlier (reconstituted) preparations, which had substantially lower specific activities, probably reflect adventitiously bound Fe3+. We discuss here how adventitiously bound iron can be identified and removed. The Fe2+ which is present in native protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase and its complexes with substrates and inhibitors reacts quantitatively with nitric oxide to produce a species with electronic spin S = 3/2. The EPR and Mossbauer spectra of these complexes compare favorably with EDTA . Fe(II) . NO. We have studied the latter complex extensively and have analyzed the Mossbauer spectra with an S = 3/2 spin Hamiltonian. EPR spectra show that protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase-NO complexes with substrates or inhibitors are heterogeneous and consist of several well defined subspecies. The data show that NO, and presumably also O2, has access to the active site Fe2+ in the enzyme-substrate complex. The use of EPR-detectable NO complexes as a rapid and sensitive tool for the study of the EPR silent active site iron of extradiol dioxygenases is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2054933558,"Symbiotic nitrogen fixation by Rhizobium meliloti requires the developmentally specific expression of certain bacterial genes. One set of these genes encodes the subunits of nitrogenase, the enzyme responsible for the reduction of atmospheric dinitrogen to ammonia, and another set consists of closely linked genes also essential for nitrogen fixation. Examination of promoter and probable regulatory regions for these gene sets has revealed extensive DNA sequence conservation for more than 160 bp upstream of the respective transcription start points. Three such promoter regions have been identified in the nitrogen fixation (nif) gene cluster of R. meliloti strain 102F34. Using one of these promoter regions as a hybridization probe, three additional sequences were found in the genome of this strain. The DNA of other R. meliloti strains and Rhizobium species were also examined for homology to the symbiotically regulated promoters of R. meliloti 102F34. DNA sequences homologous to these R. meliloti promoters were found among diverse rhizobia, and in at least some cases were associated with nif genes."
https://openalex.org/W2068825288,"We have localized ten oxi3- mutations in the first, al1, intron of the coxl gene. All are splicing deficient, being unable to excise the intron. Complementation experiments disclose several domains in the intron al1: the 5'-proximal and 3'-proximal domains harbor cis-dominant mutations, while trans-recessive ones are located in the intron's open reading frame. Comprehensive analyses of allele-specific polypeptides accumulating in mutants show that they result from the translation of the intron's ORF. We conclude that a specific mRNA maturase involved in splicing of oxidase mRNA is encoded by the intron al1 in a manner similar to the cytochrome b mRNA maturase."
https://openalex.org/W1982741134,"Unstable ars1 (autonomously replicating sequence)-containing plasmids can be stabilized by connecting particular DNA segments of yeast 2 mu-plasmid. A cis-acting locus for the plasmid's stability (the STB locus) was found in the large unique region and separated from the replication origin of 2 mu-plasmid. Several direct repeats found in this region were essential for its function. Two proteins encoded by the plasmid (B and C) were required as trans-acting factors. The average copy number of the plasmid was not affected whether the plasmid carried the stability system or not, suggesting that the system was not directly associated with the replication function but was involved in partitioning at cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2139258737,"We demonstrate that the topoisomerase activity of bacteriophage lambda Int protein introduces single-strand breaks into duplex DNA at specific sites. Strand breakage is accompanied by the covalent linkage of Int to DNA. The linkage connects a residue in Int to the 3' phosphate of DNA at the site of breakage; the other breakage product has a 5' OH terminus. Int is the first procaryotic topoisomerase shown to break DNA in this manner. We find that in att sites, Int breaks DNA within the 15 bp homologous core. These sites of Int topoisomerase action result from the interaction of Int with ""junction-type"" recognition sequences (CAACTTNNT), and Int topoisomerase acts between the 7th and 8th bases of this sequence. The sites of breakage within the cores of attP and attB coincide exactly with positions where breakage and reunion occur during Int-dependent recombination. These results indicate that Int topoisomerase executes strand exchange during recombination."
https://openalex.org/W1592200608,"Hormone-sensitive lipase, detergent-solubilized and purified from rat adipose tissue, was phosphorylated with the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase from the same tissue. Maximally 1.05 +/- 0.05 (mean +/- S.E. (n = 3) ) mol of phosphate/mol of hormone-sensitive lipase Mr = 84,000 subunit was incorporated. Phosphoserine was the only phosphorylated amino acid residue. A single phosphorylation site was demonstrated by digestion with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and trypsin that produced a single acidic phosphopeptide of about 10 amino acid residues length, which was isolated by two-dimensional electrophoresis-thin layer chromatography. Enzyme activity was enhanced, 2.5-fold against trioleoylglycerol, concomitant with phosphorylation, with half-maximal effect within 30 sec, a rate of phosphorylation of the enzyme comparable to that obtained in vivo (Nilsson, N. O., Stralfors, P., Fredrikson, G., and Belfrage, P. (1980) FEBS Lett. 111, 125-130). The initial rate of phosphorylation was approximately half that with phosphorylase kinase as substrate. The effects of modifications of hormone-sensitive lipase and of various additions and variation in pH were examined."

https://openalex.org/W2137748564,"We have shown that neither the signal recognition particle (SRP) nor the SRP receptor is directly involved in the maintenance of a ribosome-membrane junction for the translocation of secretory proteins. We found that the purified SRP receptor releases the signal-sequence-induced and SRP-mediated elongation arrest of synthesis by displacing SRP from the ribosome. This SRP displacement was not accompanied by binding of the SRP receptor to the ribosome. Using intact microsomal membranes as a source of the SRP receptor, we found that both SRP displacement and binding of the elongation-arrested ribosome to the membrane can occur at 0 degrees C, by a mechanism that is independent of chain elongation."
https://openalex.org/W2121066085,"The transposition-replication reaction of phage Mu has been reproduced in a cell-free reaction system. Two assay methods were used for the detection of transposition products. The first method uses λ DNA as the target of transposition and a plasmid containing the ends of Mu DNA and an ampicillin-resistance gene as the donor; after the reaction, in vitro X packaging allows the scoring of amp′ transducing phages generated by transposition. In the second method, the products made in the presence of a radioactive precursor for DNA synthesis are directly analyzed by gel electrophoresis and unique product species are identified. The reaction requires a donor DNA carrying the two Mu ends in their proper relative orientation, extracts containing the A and B gene products of Mu, and host factor(s). RNA synthesis by E. coli RNA polymerase is not required for the reaction. The products include both cointegrates and simple inserts. Both types of products show incorporation of radioactive DNA precursors; however, simple inserts do not seem to undergo a full round of DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1505154018,"Abstract The mechanism of enzymatic inactivation of purified and membrane-bound acetylcholine esterase by ascorbate and copper was investigated. While the exposure of the enzyme to either ascorbate or copper did not cause enzymatic inactivation, the incubation of the enzyme with a combination of both ascorbate and copper resulted in a loss in acetylcholine esterase activity, which was time dependent. The enzymatic inactivation required either molecular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide under anaerobic conditions. Scavengers of hydroxyl radicals at concentrations of up to 100 mM did not provide protection to acetylcholine esterase. Only mannitol at very high concentrations (above 1 M) efficiently prevented the inactivation of the enzyme. The kinetics of the aerobic oxidation of reduced ascorbate in the presence of acetylcholine esterase and copper closely followed the rate of enzyme inactivation. Addition of the chelating agents EDTA and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid prevented both the oxidation of ascorbate and the inactivation of the enzyme. In the presence of low concentrations of histidine (0.5-2.0 mM), which forms high affinity complexes with copper, the rate of ascorbate oxidation was similar to that recorded in its absence. On the other hand, no enzyme inactivation was indicated in the presence of histidine. Low temperature EPR measurements have demonstrated the binding of copper to the enzyme, and have shown the reduction of the cupric enzyme to the corresponding cuprous complex. In view of these results, a general site-specific mechanism for biological damage can be offered, in which copper(II) ions are bound to enzymes or other biological macromolecules. Ascorbate plays a dual role: it reduces the cupric complex to the corresponding cuprous state and serves as a source for H2O2, which, in turn, reacts with the reduced copper complex, in a Fenton reaction. In this reaction, secondary hydroxyl radicals are site specifically formed, and react preferentially with the protein, at the site of their formation, causing its inactivation. This mechanism is analogous to that previously proposed (Samuni, A., Chevion, M., and Czapski, G. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 12632-12635) for the enhancement of the biological damage caused by superoxide in the presence of copper."
https://openalex.org/W1983727450,"E. coli recA protein promotes the pairing of circular single strands with linear duplex DNA and the subsequent formation of large heteroduplex joints. From fd and M13 DNA, recA protein can make heteroduplex joints that include every kind of single base-pair mismatch. Aided by E. coli single-strand binding protein (SSB) and ATP regeneration, recA protein can incorporate into heteroduplex DNA insertions that are hundreds of base pairs long, whether the extra DNA is located initially in either the single-stranded or the double-stranded substrate. The ability of recA protein to span large insertions in the duplex DNA indicates that it unwinds a sizeable number of turns in advance of the growing heteroduplex joint. These observations show that an enzymatic basis exists in E. coli for forming extensively mismatched heteroduplex DNA, which might be involved in conversion-like events associated with recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2084100792,"Restrictions fragments encompassing the DNA sequence changes, which allow polyoma mutants to productively infect embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, have been coupled to the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV TK) gene and to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene. F9 TK(-) EC cells have been transfected with the TK constructions and transformation to TK(+) colonies has been determined. F9 EC cells, retinoic-acid-induced differentiating F9 cultures, mouse fibroblasts, and mouse myoblasts have been transfected with the CAT constructions and CAT enzyme activity has been measured from the transfected cells. The results suggest that the mutant changes function at the level of gene-expression enhancement, the mutant constructions increasing the TK transformation frequency and also yielding a higher level of CAT enzyme activity when compared with constructions having no polyoma fragment or the analogous wild-type polyoma restriction fragment. The sequence specificity for enhancement changes upon differentiation of F9 EC cells, with the CAT enzyme levels from the wild-type construction approaching the values obtained from a PyEC mutant construction having a single base-pair difference."
https://openalex.org/W1966962162,"We have isolated chicken cDNA and genomic clones for the intermediate filament subunit vimentin and show that the gene for this protein, which exists in a single copy in the haploid chicken genome, is transcribed into two mature mRNA species with approximate lengths of 2.0 and 2.3 kb. We have found cell-specific regulation in the expression of these two mRNAs; whereas both mRNA species are present in muscle cells, fibroblasts, spinal cord and lens, erythroid cells from 10- and 15-day-old chicken embryos express predominantly the lower molecular weight RNA. The difference between these two mRNAs is due to different lengths of their 3' untranslated regions, suggesting that the cell-specific regulation of their expression occurs either by specific termination of transcription or by differential post-transcriptional processing of the 3' untranslated region. Additionally, a remarkable induction (40- to 50-fold) in the abundance of the vimentin mRNA is observed in erythroid cells as chicken development proceeds from 4 to 15 days, which suggests that the level of expression of vimentin during erythroid development is regulated at the transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W2080602395,"The avian myelocytomatosis virus MC29 induces neoplastic diseases in chicken, including myelocytomas and tumors of kidney and liver, which are due to the action of the v-myc gene. However, MC29 has never been reported to cause lymphoid tumors, the disease associated with activation of the c-myc gene by the insertion of a lymphoid leukosis virus genome. We have analyzed a recovered MC29 virus, HBI, which has a myc gene containing c-myc sequences, acquired by recombination with the cellular gene, and some v-myc sequences. Inoculation of HBI into chickens resulted in lymhoid tumors independent of the bursa. Antigenically these tumors were made up of T and B cells. Molecular analysis showed HBI proviral DNA in 36 of 39 tumors analyzed, with no obvious alteration of c-myc, and the HBI gag-myc fusion protein, p 108, could be detected in tumor cells. These data are discussed in terms of the mechanism of target-cell specificity for transformation by the myc gene."
https://openalex.org/W2139948799,"Two cloned Drosophila sequences, Dash and Dsrc, were previously isolated by hybridization to the viral oncogenes v-abl and v-src. We report that the Drosophila DNA sequences are more than 50% homologous to 700 base pairs of the vertebrate oncogenes that are essential for kinase activity of the v-abl and the v-src gene products. Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences in the homologous regions shows amino acid sequence identities of 74% between Dash and the 5′ portion of v-abl and of 54% between Dsrc and 3′ portion of v-src. Comparison of the Drosophila and vertebrate sequences identifies amino acids that may be essential for the distinct functions of the c-src and the c-abl gene products and places the gene duplication event that has generated the two genes prior to the Chordate-Arthropod divergence."
https://openalex.org/W1680719178,"Abstract Enzymatic activity which hydrolyzes diadenosine 5',5'-P1,P4-tetraphosphate (Ap4A) yielding ADP has been identified in extracts of eubacteria, Escherichia coli and Acidaminococcus fermentans, and of a highly thermophilic archaebacterium, Pyrodictum occultum. Specific Ap4A (symmetric) pyrophosphohydrolase from Escherichia coli K12 has been purified almost 400-fold. The preparation was free of phosphatase, ATPase, phosphodiesterase, AMP-nucleosidase, and adenylate kinase. The Ap4A pyrophosphohydrolase molecular weight estimated by gel filtration is 27,000 +/- 1,000. Activity maximum is at pH 8.3. The Km value computed for Ap4A is 25 +/- 3 microM. The sulfhydryl group(s) is essential for enzyme activity. Metal chelators, EDTA, and o-phenanthroline, inhibit Ap4A hydrolysis; I0.5 values are 3 and 50 microM, respectively. Co2+ is a strong stimulator with an almost 100-fold increase in rate of Ap4A hydrolysis and a plateau in the range of 100-500 microM Co2+, when compared with the nonstimulated hydrolysis. Other transition metal ions, Mn2+, Cd2+, and Ni2+, stimulate by factors of 8, 3.5, and 3.5, respectively, with optimal concentrations in the range 200-500, 2-5, and 4-8 microM, respectively. Zn2+, Cu2+, and Fe2+, up to 30 microM, are without effect and they inhibit at higher concentrations. Mg2+ or Ca2+, in the absence of other divalent metal ions, are weak stimulators (1.5-fold stimulation occurs at 1-2 mM concentration), but act synergistically with Co2+ at its suboptimal concentrations. Stimulation in the presence of 10 microM Co2+ and either 1 mM MgCl2 or CaCl2 increases up to 75-fold. The same degree of synergy is found at 10 microM Co2+ and either 2-5 mM spermidine or 0.5-1.5 mM spermine. Besides Ap4A, bacterial Ap4A pyrophosphohydrolase hydrolyzes effectively Ap5A and Gp4G, and, to some extent, p4A, Ap6A, and Ap3A yielding in each case corresponding nucleoside diphosphate as one of the products."
https://openalex.org/W2072709970,"The mouse neuroblastoma-rat glioma hybrid cell line NG108-15 was used to study the acute and chronic interaction of ethanol with intact neural cells. In the short term, ethanol inhibited opiate receptor binding, but after long-term exposure the cells exhibited an apparent adaptive increase in the number of opiate binding sites; this was reversible when ethanol was withdrawn. High concentrations of ethanol (200 mM) increased opiate binding after 18 to 24 hours, whereas lower concentrations (25 to 50 mM) produced similar changes after 2 weeks. This model system has potential for exploring the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying ethanol intoxication, tolerance, and withdrawal."
https://openalex.org/W2065978184,"Insertion sequence IS50R, which encodes the transposase and an inhibitor of transposition of the kanamycin-resistance transposon Tn5, increases the growth rate of E. coli K12 cells relative to that of their otherwise isogenic counterparts during competition in continuous culture. Most clones isolated from chemostats in which selection had occurred retain their original number of copies of IS50R at their original genomic locations, implying that the increased growth rate is not mediated by transposition. The selective advantage due to a single IS50R element averages about 5% per hour. When the number of copies of IS50R is small, the growth-rate advantage is approximately proportional to the number of copies of IS50R. These results imply that IS50R has effects on cells that are independent of both position and transposition and may be important in the initial selection leading to the appearance of such elements in bacterial populations."
https://openalex.org/W1505976169,"The mechanism of the metabolic inactivation of leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4 by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes activated by phorbol myristate acetate has been analyzed with the use of activated cells, their supernatants, the isolated components of the myeloperoxidase system, and chemically synthesized hypochlorous acid (HOC1). The metabolic products were resolved by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography in one or more solvent systems, and each product was characterized relative to chemically synthesized standards by its reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography retention time, UV absorption spectrum, nonvascular smooth muscle spasmogenic activity, and immunoreactivity. The phorbol myristate acetate-activated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes converted each of the sulfidopeptide leukotrienes to products identical with synthetic diastereoisomers of 6-trans-leukotriene B4 by the following criteria: retention times in two solvent systems, lambda max of 269 nm with shoulders at 259 and 279 nm, and mass spectral analysis. Each of the sulfidopeptide leukotrienes was simultaneously converted to subclass-specific S-diastereoisomeric sulfoxides which co-chromatographed with synthetic standards, exhibited a bathochromic shift to a lambda max at 284 nm, were fully immunoreactive, and possessed less than 5% spasmogenic activity of the corresponding sulfidopeptide leukotrienes. When the sulfidopeptide leukotrienes were incubated with supernatants of phorbol myristate acetate-activated cells in the presence of 0.1 mM H2O2, with a mixture of 100 milliunits of myeloperoxidase, 0.1 mM H2O2, and 10 mM Cl-, or with chemically prepared HOCl, the metabolic products formed were the same as those obtained with the activated cells, indicating that extracellular inactivation was due to HOCl produced by the action of released myeloperoxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1966999414,The initiation of DNA replication of the low copy number plasmid pSC101 is dependent on the dnaA initiator protein encoded by Escherichia coli. We have previously reported that the minimum essential replicon of the plasmid encodes a approximately 37.5 kd protein and that the protein is necessary along with host-encoded proteins for the replication of the plasmid chromosome. In this communication we show that the plasmid-encoded protein has sequence-specific DNA-binding activity. The protein binds cooperatively to the replication origin of pSC101. Using chemical and enzymatic probes we have determined the contact points of the protein with the DNA and the precise domain of the replication origin recognized by the 37.5 kd protein. The specificity of the DNA-protein interaction would suggest that the 37.5 kd protein may possibly function by guiding the replisome to the correct DNA sequence on the chromosome of pSC101.

Authentic 8,15-diHETE, identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, was prepared by treating arachidonic acid with soybean lipoxygenase and was purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Using a leading front assay, 8,15-diHETE exhibited significant chemotactic activity at a concentration of 5.0 ng/ml. Maximum chemotactic activity was observed at a concentration of 30 ng/ml. The 8,15-diHETE generated by mixed human leukocytes after stimulation with arachidonic acid and the calcium ionophore, A23187, exhibited quantitatively similar chemotactic activity. Two synthetic all-trans conjugated isomers of 8,15-diHETE, however, were not chemotactic at concentrations up to 500 ng/ml. In contrast to its potent chemotactic activity, 8,15-diHETE (at concentrations up to 10 micrograms/ml) was relatively inactive with respect to its ability to provoke either degranulation or generation of superoxide anion radicals by cytochalasin B-treated leukocytes. Both leukotriene B4 and 8,15-diHETE may be important mediators of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1531528768,"Acyl carrier protein (ACP) functions as a cofactor in fatty acid biosynthesis due to the covalent linkage of an acyl moiety to its 4'-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group. This prosthetic group undergoes turnover in vivo and since the apoprotein is functionally inactive, the interconversion between ACP and apo-ACP has been considered as a possible regulatory point in lipid biosynthesis. To investigate this possibility, the ratio of ACP to apo-ACP was measured in Escherichia coli. An apo-ACP standard was synthesized using [ACP] phosphodiesterase (EC 3.1.4.14) and could be clearly separated from ACP by conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis, thus providing a reliable assay for the presence of these two species. Antibodies specific for ACP were purified from rabbit serum on an ACP-Sepharose column and subsequently used to synthesize an immunoaffinity column. Chromatography of leucine-labeled cell extracts on this support resulted in the specific binding of ACP, but apo-ACP was not detected in either logarithmically growing or stationary phase cells, although both ACP species bound to the purified anti-ACP IgG. Apo-ACP was not detected as an intermediate in ACP biosynthesis, suggesting that apo-ACP is rapidly converted to ACP following translation. CoA is the biosynthetic precursor to the ACP prosthetic group, but apo-ACP did not accumulate when the intracellular CoA concentration was severely depressed in strain SJ16 (panD), a beta-alanine auxotroph. Strain MP4 (acpS) is conditionally defective in [ACP]synthase (EC 2.7.8.7) and apo-ACP was the predominant form of ACP synthesized in this strain under nonpermissive conditions. Even under conditions that permitted growth, apo-ACP comprised 70% of the total ACP pool in strain MP4. Strain MP4 possessed a phospholipid to protein ratio within the normal range, suggesting that the ratio of ACP to apo-ACP can be significantly altered without affecting total lipid content. Thus, it appears that the prosthetic group turnover cycle maintains all of the ACP in an active form in vivo and a regulatory role for the ACP/apo-ACP ratio seems doubtful."
https://openalex.org/W1558239059,"The relationship between endogenous ADP-ribosylation of chromosomal proteins and glucocorticoid-regulated mouse mammary tumor virus gene expression was investigated in cultured mouse mammary tumor cells. It was observed that glucocorticoids quickly decreased endogenous (ADP-ribose)n on the nonhistone high mobility group (HMG) 14 and 17 proteins. The half-time for this loss was 8 and 17 min, respectively, for the two proteins. (ADP-ribose)n on HMG 1 and 2 and on histone H1 was less susceptible to hydrolysis during glucocorticoid treatment. The rapid loss of (ADP-ribose)n from HMG 14 and 17 occurred in the same time frame as the induction of mouse mammary tumor virus RNA synthesis by glucocorticoids in these cells (Young, H. A., Shih, T. Y., Scolnick, E. M., and Parks, W. P. (1977) J. Virol. 21, 139-149). 3-Amino-benzamide, a specific inhibitor of (ADP-ribose)n synthetase, increased mouse mammary tumor virus RNA levels with an accompanying decrease in endogenous ADP-ribosylation of HMG 14 and 17. These results show that a decrease in endogenous ADP-ribosylation of HMG 14 and 17 is a consequence of glucocorticoid action and suggest that loss of (ADP-ribose)n from these proteins may be an important event in mouse mammary tumor virus gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2019100271,"A soluble system that specifically and accurately initiates transcription on defined vaccinia virus templates has been obtained from lysates of infected cells. The required regulatory signals are contained within a DNA segment extending about 230 bp upstream and 30 bp downstream of the RNA start site. Transcription is resistant to α-amanitin and inhibited by antibodies to the viral RNA polymerase. Whole cell extracts from uninfected cells cannot accurately transcribe vaccinia DNA. Conversely, extracts prepared at 2 hr or later after vaccinia infection no longer transcribe RNA polymerase II templates but retain the ability to transcribe RNA polymerase III templates as well as vaccinia virus DNA. These profound changes in transcriptional specificity may contribute to the selective expression of viral genes following vaccinia infection."
https://openalex.org/W1596370061,"The substrate specificity of cGMP-dependent protein kinase has been investigated by examining the ability of the enzyme to phosphorylate a series of synthetic peptides that correspond to the amino acid sequence at its site of autophosphorylation. The undecapeptide Ile53-Gly-Pro-Arg-Thr-Thr58-Arg-Ala-Gln-Gly-Ile63 which corresponds to the sequence around threonine-58 in cGMP-dependent protein kinase (Takio, K., Smith, S.B., Walsh, K.A., Krebs, E.G., and Titani, K. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 5531-5536) was synthesized and tested as a substrate for that enzyme. It was phosphorylated to the extent of 1.0 mol of phosphate/mol of peptide. Analysis of the products of Edman degradation of the phosphopeptide indicated that only threonine-58 was phosphorylated, as is the case for the autophosphorylation reaction in the native enzyme. The peptide was phosphorylated by cGMP-dependent protein kinase with a Km value of 578 +/- 25 microM and a Vmax of 0.069 +/- 0.003 mumol/min/mg of enzyme. This low Vmax value is consistent with the relatively slow rate of the autophosphorylation reaction. An analog peptide that contained serine in place of threonine-58 was also phosphorylated to 1.0 mol of phosphate/mol of peptide. That phosphopeptide contained only phosphoserine. The serine-containing analog peptide had a Km value similar to that of the parent peptide but was phosphorylated with a 70-fold higher Vmax value. Substitution of arginine-56 in the parent peptide by an alanine residue resulted in a peptide that was essentially not a substrate. Substitution of arginine-59, COOH-terminal to the phosphorylatable threonine, yielded a peptide with a Vmax similar to that of the parent peptide but a Km value of almost 22,000 microM. These results indicate that serine is a better phosphate-accepting residue than is threonine and that both arginine residues around the site of autophosphorylation are important specificity determinants for the cGMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2005693873,"Gap junctions have been isolated from both rat heart and liver, tissues where junctions are typical in appearance and physiology. The purity of the fractions obtained was monitored by electron microscopy (thin-sectioning and negative staining) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The myocardial gap junctions are comprised of a single polypeptide of Mr 28,000, apparently derived from a protein of Mr 30,000. Hepatic gap junctions are also comprised of a single native protein of Mr 28,000 as previously reported. Exhaustive trypsin digestion of the isolated junctions cleaves both of these proteins similarly, while leaving their characteristic junctional lattice structures intact. However, comparison of heart and liver junctional proteins by two-dimensional peptide mapping of tryptic and α-chymotryptic fragments, followed by high pressure liquid chromatography, reveals no homology between these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1481640863,"The cleavage of specific DNA sequences by the restriction endonucleases AluI, DdeI, HinfI, RsaI, and TaqI has been studied by monitoring the effect of various nucleotide modifications on the rate of DNA digestion. Bacteriophage fd DNA was completely substituted in one strand with a single nucleotide analog, using an in vitro primed DNA synthesis reaction on a single-stranded viral DNA template. Twelve deoxynucleotide analogs were incorporated into these DNA substrates: 2-aminopurine, 2,6-diaminopurine, deoxytubercidin, deoxyuridine, 5-bromodeoxyuridine, 5-allylamine deoxyuridine, 5-biotinyl deoxyuridine, deoxypseudouridine, deoxyinosine, 8-azadeoxyguanosine, 5-iododeoxycytidine, and 5-bromodeoxycytidine. The restriction enzymes tested varied considerably in their ability to digest hemi-substituted DNAs containing these modified nucleotides. Structural alterations in the base pairs immediately adjacent to the phosphodiester bonds cleaved by the enzyme reduced the rate of enzyme activity most dramatically, and in most cases more than a single determinant on each base pair altered activity. Interactions with nucleotides outside the recognition site seem to have little importance in the binding or catalytic activity of these enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1578403770,"The radiation inactivation of membrane-bound (Na,K)-ATPase from pig kidney was studied by irradiating lyophilized enzyme preparations in vacuo. Various results were obtained depending upon the function assayed. The apparent target size of (Na,K)-ATPase activity was found to be 264 kDa an the high affinity binding sites for ATP, vanadate, and ouabain (bound in the presence of Na+, Mg2+, and ATP) had an apparent target size of 145 kDa. The binding of ouabain in the presence of Mg2+ alone seemed to depend upon the integrity of a domain with a target size of approximately 100 kDa. Na-ATPase and p-nitrophenyl phosphatase, assayed under a variety of conditions, gave inactivation kinetics that did not conform to classical target theory. All the results have been assembled into a model according to which 1) the membrane-bound enzyme is an (alpha beta)2-dimer; 2) there is radiation energy coupling between all four peptides in a molecule, and 3) each alpha-peptide consists of five discrete and independent radiation-sensitive domains with specific functions in the enzymatic reactions catalyzed by the sodium pump."
https://openalex.org/W152052855,"An improved device for potentiometry using magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy has been developed and used to characterize the potentiometric behavior of solubilized beef heart cytochrome oxidase. In the absence of inhibitors, the electron affinity of cytochromes alpha and alpha 3 are indistinguishable and adequately described by the allosteric model of Nicholls and Peterson (Nicholls, P., and Peterson, L. C. (1972) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 357, 462-467). All of the cytochrome alpha can be accounted for as low spin heme throughout the titration. Cytochrome c present at 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1 stoichiometry with cytochrome alpha did not significantly affect the potentiometric behavior of alpha or chondroitinase alpha 3; at the 1:1 ratio the midpoint potential of cytochrome c was lowered by about 30 mV. In the presence of formate, azide and cyanide cytochrome alpha assumed approximately n = 1 behavior. However, the response of alpha 3 differed with each reagent and was particularly complex in the presence of azide. Fluoride produced very small changes in the potentiometric behavior suggesting that it may not be a ligand to cytochrome alpha 3. Possible deficiencies in the allosteric model are examined."
https://openalex.org/W128823262,"At the concentrations usually employed as a Ca2+ indicator, arsenazo III undergoes a one-electron reduction by rat liver microsomes to produce an azo anion radical as demonstrated by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. Either NADH or NADPH can serve as a source of reducing equivalents for the production of this free radical by rat liver microsomes. The steady state concentration of the azo anion radical is proportional to the square root of the protein concentration, suggesting that the radical decays through a nonenzymatic second order process. The steady state concentration of the azo anion radical is not altered in the presence of metyrapone or CO, and is decreased in the presence of NADP+ or p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. These observations suggest that the formation of arsenazo III anion radical is mediated through NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase and not by cytochrome P-450. Under aerobic conditions, addition of arsenazo III to rat liver microsomes produces an increase in electron flow from NAD(P)H to molecular oxygen, generating both superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. The steady state concentration of the azo anion radical, but neither oxygen consumption nor superoxide anion formation, is enhanced by calcium and magnesium, suggesting an enhanced azo anion radical-stabilization by complexation with the metal ions. Accordingly, the arsenazo III anion radical signal is abolished in the presence of paramagnetic metal ions (Fe3+, Gd3+, and Ni2+) and enhanced in the presence of other diamagnetic metal ions (La3+). Antipyrylazo III is less effective than arsenazo III in increasing superoxide anion formation by rat liver microsomes, and gives a much weaker ESR spectrum of an azo anion radical. Murexide is reduced to the monodehydro-5,5'-iminobarbituric acid radical by rat liver microsomes, and its efficiency as a superoxide anion generator is intermediate between arsenazo III and antipyrylazo III."
https://openalex.org/W1546675367,"Cytosols from rat thymus cells incubated with glucocorticoid contain nonactivated and activated receptors and mero-receptor complexes, in relative amounts that depend on the incubation conditions. These forms can be separated by a rapid minicolumn chromatographic technique based on their differential affinities for DNA, DEAE, and hydroxylapatite. We have used this method to examine the effects of ATP, pyrophosphate (PPi), and related compounds on cytosolic complexes. In addition to ATP, already known to promote activation at 0 degrees C, PPi, ADP, and other triphosphates at millimolar concentrations promoted activation of nonactivated complexes. AMP and Pi had little effect. ATP and PPi at millimolar concentrations also reduced binding of activated complexes to DNA. Characterization of the ATP- and PPi-activated complexes by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography revealed two DNA-binding forms. One was essentially identical (Stokes radius of approximately 5.4 nm, elution from DEAE at approximately 50 mM KCl) to the normal activated complex obtained directly from cells incubated at 37 degrees C. The other had a Stokes radius of approximately 3.1 nm and had no affinity for DEAE. Analysis by minicolumns and gel filtration showed that ATP and PPi prevented formation of mero-receptor complexes, a process which occurs relatively rapidly in untreated thymus cytosols. These compounds did not alter properties of preformed mero-receptor. The accumulation of 3.1-nm complexes in thymus cytosols in which formation of mero-receptor is prevented suggests that this form is an intermediate, normally short-lived, in the conversion of 5.4 nm complexes to mero-receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1574067873,"We studied deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine phosphorylating activities in human placental cytosol. The specific activities of nucleoside kinase enzymes in nanomoles per h per mg +/- SD were as follows: adenosine kinase, 30 +/- 14; deoxyadenosine kinase, 12 +/- 2; deoxycytidine kinase, 0.30 +/- 0.04; and deoxyguanosine kinase, 27 +/- 16. Three major activities were resolved by ion exchange and affinity chromatography: deoxyguanosine-deoxycytidine kinase, deoxycytidine-deoxyadenosine kinase, and adenosine-deoxyadenosine kinase. Two other activities contained significant quantities of deoxyadenosine kinase. Deoxyguanosine-phosphorylating activity eluted as a single peak in association with deoxycytidine kinase. This deoxyguanosine-deoxycytidine kinase had an apparent molecular weight of 54,000, a Stokes radius of 31 A, and apparent Km values of 10, 130, and 14 microM for deoxyguanosine, deoxycytidine, and ATP, respectively. Four peaks of deoxyadenosine phosphorylating activity were resolved by affinity chromatography with AMP-Sepharose 4B. Adenosine-deoxyadenosine kinase had an apparent molecular weight of 38,000, a Stokes radius of 27.4 A, and apparent Km values of 0.4, 510, and 75 microM for adenosine, deoxyadenosine, and ATP, respectively. Attempts to distinguish whether adenosine-deoxyadenosine kinase was one enzyme with these two activities or two separate enzymes suggested that the former was the case. Deoxycytidine-deoxyadenosine kinase had apparent Km values of 0.7, 670, and 12 microM for deoxycytidine, deoxyadenosine, and ATP, respectively. Its apparent molecular weight was estimated to be 49,000 and its Stokes radius 30 A. Two other minor peaks of deoxyadenosine-phosphorylating activity had characteristics different from either deoxycytidine kinase or adenosine kinase-associated deoxyadenosine kinase. Our studies indicate that human placental cytosol contains a complex mixture of nucleoside kinase enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2084165167,Previous studies at this laboratory showed that repeated application of inactivated herpes simplex virus type 2 to the mouse cevix produced premalignant and malignant lesions. In the present study mice were inoculated with inactivated herpes simplex virus type 2 or control solution and Freund's adjuvant by intraperitoneal and subcuaneous routes before exposure of the cervix to inactivated virus. It appears that immunization with inactivated virus conferred a protection against the induction of cervical carcinoma.
https://openalex.org/W55204829,"The diphtheria toxin fragment A-related polypeptide encoded by the recombinant plasmid pDT201 (Leong, D., Coleman, K. D., and Murphy, J. R. (1983) Science 220, 515-517) and expressed in Escherichia coli K12 was found to have an electrophoretic mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels corresponding to 28,500 daltons. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the mature form of the fragment A-related polypeptide was exported to the periplasmic compartment of E. coli K12 harboring plasmid pDT201. The polypeptide was sensitive to trypsin nicking. Following treatment an Mr = 24,000 fragment was released which co-electrophoresed with fragment A of diphtheria toxin. The precursor form (Mr = 31,000) of the fragment A-related polypeptide was found to accumulate in the cytoplasmic fraction of the temperature-sensitive secretion-defective strain of E. coli K12 under nonpermissive conditions. We further demonstrate that a 263-base pair HaeIII fragment of pDT201 which carries the putative diphtheria tox promoter has promoter activity in E. coli K12."
https://openalex.org/W1524927948,"Rat liver microsomes were isolated and fractionated into Golgi, smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER), and rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and the purity of these preparations was determined. The dolichyl phosphate (Dol-P) content of whole microsomes and of each of the submicrosomal fractions was estimated using high pressure liquid chromatography. Dol-P accounts for 4 and 40% of the sum of the alcohol, the fatty acyl esters of dolichol, and monophosphate forms present in whole liver and in purified microsomes, respectively. Concentrations equal to 58, 77, and 108 ng of Dol-P/mg of protein were found in Golgi, SER, and RER, respectively. These values represent 3, 36, and 54% of the sum of the alcohol, the fatty acyl esters of dolichol, and monophosphate forms present in each of these same fractions, respectively. Increases in the Dol-P content of rat liver were observed as early as 12 h after turpentine-induced inflammation and increased 2-fold over 36 h. In this system, Dol-P accounts for no more than 50% of the sum of all phosphorylated and pyrophosphorylated dolichol intermediates present. The specific activity for dolichyl phosphate phosphatase was highest by more than a factor of 2 in Golgi membrane. Specific activities obtained for SER and RER were 42 and 11% of those present in Golgi. The major requirement for Dol-P is thought to be for the saccharide and oligosaccharide transferase reactions which are presumed to take place in RER. The discovery of significant quantities of Dol-P in Golgi and SER is consistent with a possible role of Dol-P in the transport of sugars required for glycoprotein synthesis and processing from a cytosolic to luminal orientation."
https://openalex.org/W1566647429,"Inhibition of neutrophil superoxide production has been previously reported for reagents and polypeptides which also inhibit serine proteases. There are disagreements between the results of different laboratories including our own, which have attempted to use the Kunitz soybean trypsin inhibitor to block neutrophil superoxide production. Having confirmed that crude extracts of soybean do contain inhibitory factors which affect neutrophil superoxide production, we have resolved polypeptides in an ethanolic extract of soybean flour by anion and cation exchange chromatography and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fractions have been assayed for protease inhibitory activity and inhibition of neutrophil superoxide production. We have found an inverse relation between these two inhibitory activities during the purification process. Two of three isolated polypeptides are potent inhibitors of neutrophil superoxide production (50% inhibition at 10(-7) M) but retain only weak anti-trypsin activity. A third polypeptide is a potent inhibitor of trypsin but is completely lacking superoxide inhibitory activity. None of the isolated polypeptides inhibit chymotrypsin. The implications of these findings for the hypothetical association between neutrophil production of superoxide and cellular proteases are discussed."

This analog retains a high binding affinity for the vasopressin receptor in plasma membranes from bovine kidney inner medulla (apparent dissociation constant, KD = 8.5 X 10(-9) M). [Asu1,6, Phe (p-N3)3] AVP was found to be biologically active in triggering the characteristic increase in toad bladder permeability to water. Photolysis of the analog in the presence of the toad bladder results in a hydroosmotic response which persists, in spite of repeated washings, for more than 18 h. The irreversible stimulation of the bladder is inhibited when photolysis is carried out in the presence of vasopressin. Our findings indicate that with photoactivation [Asu1,6, Phe(p-N3)3]AVP binds covalently to hormonal receptors and forms an active hormone-receptor complex. This analog, therefore, is a suitable tool for studies of hydroosmotic receptor function and for receptor isolation."
https://openalex.org/W1548683943,"A variety of chemical agents that are known to induce erythrodifferentiation in the Friend virus-induced murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cell have been suggested to mediate DNA cleavage in cultured cells prior to differentiation. The activation of the nuclear enzyme, ADP-ribosyltransferase, depends upon the presence of single strand breaks in DNA. If dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) causes DNA breakage, it would be expected that the activity of ADP-ribosyltransferase would increase. A study of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity during cell growth indicates that both Me2SO-treated and untreated MEL cells exhibit a similar increase in the enzyme activity but the increase in Me2SO-treated cells is delayed by a few hours. When examined at comparable stages of growth, both treated and untreated cells show almost identical levels of enzyme activity. The present data thus do not support the contention that Me2SO induces DNA breakage in the MEL cells."
