https://openalex.org/W3004127014,"Molecular mechanisms of ovarian aging and female age-related fertility decline remain unclear. We surveyed the single-cell transcriptomic landscape of ovaries from young and aged non-human primates (NHPs) and identified seven ovarian cell types with distinct gene-expression signatures, including oocyte and six types of ovarian somatic cells. In-depth dissection of gene-expression dynamics of oocytes revealed four subtypes at sequential and stepwise developmental stages. Further analysis of cell-type-specific aging-associated transcriptional changes uncovered the disturbance of antioxidant signaling specific to early-stage oocytes and granulosa cells, indicative of oxidative damage as a crucial factor in ovarian functional decline with age. Additionally, inactivated antioxidative pathways, increased reactive oxygen species, and apoptosis were observed in granulosa cells from aged women. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the cell-type-specific mechanisms underlying primate ovarian aging at single-cell resolution, revealing new diagnostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for age-related human ovarian disorders."

Cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 serve as key components of the endocannabinoid system and are the principal targets of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), a psychoactive chemical from Cannabis sativa with a wide range of therapeutic applications (Lemberger, 1980Lemberger L. Potential therapeutic usefulness of marijuana.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1980; 20: 151-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). CB1 and CB2 play crucial roles in a variety of physiological processes, including appetite, pain sensation, memory, and immunomodulation (Guzmán, 2003Guzmán M. Cannabinoids: potential anticancer agents.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 745-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The two cannabinoid receptors share 44% total sequence identity and 68% sequence similarity in the transmembrane regions (Munro et al., 1993Munro S. Thomas K.L. Abu-Shaar M. Molecular characterization of a peripheral receptor for cannabinoids.Nature. 1993; 365: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (3863) Google Scholar). However, they differ in their tissue distribution and exert distinct functions in endocannabinoid system, where CB1 and CB2 are expressed predominantly in the central nervous system and the immune system, respectively. So far, several crystal structures of cannabinoid receptors have been determined, including antagonist-bound (Hua et al., 2016Hua T. Vemuri K. Pu M. Qu L. Han G.W. Wu Y. Zhao S. Shui W. Li S.

Nikas S.P. Laprairie R.B. Wu Y. Qu L. Pu M. Korde A. Jiang S. Ho J.H. et al.Crystal structures of agonist-bound human cannabinoid receptor CB1.Nature. 2017; 547: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) as well as antagonist-bound CB2 structures (Li et al., 2019Li X. Hua T. Vemuri K. Ho J.H. Wu Y. Wu L. Popov P. Benchama O. Zvonok N. Locke K. et al.Crystal Structure of the Human Cannabinoid Receptor CB2.Cell. 2019; 176: 459-467.e13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). While these structures have enhanced our understanding of the ligand induced inactive or active-like states, there are a number of important challenges that remain. First, the development of therapeutic applications has been hindered by difficulty in specifically modulating the individual cannabinoid receptors due to their high sequence similarity. Also, the absence of the agonist-bound CB2 structure has held back the development of CB2-selective agonists as high potential drug candidates for treating inflammatory and neuropathic pain without the psychoactivity of CB1 (Contino et al., 2017Contino M.

Biology and therapeutic potential of cannabinoid CB2 receptor inverse agonists.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 153: 226-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Finally, CB2 and CB1 elicit their physiological responses by coupling primarily to Gi/o proteins to inhibit adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP signaling, yet CB1 also couples with Gs (G protein-stimulating adenylate cyclase) or Gq/11 (G protein-activating phospholipase C and G protein-increasing cytosolic Ca2+) to instigate signaling under special circumstances (Glass and Felder, 1997Glass M. Felder C.C. Concurrent stimulation of cannabinoid CB1 and dopamine D2 receptors augments cAMP accumulation in striatal neurons: evidence for a Gs linkage to the CB1 receptor.J.

USA. 2005; 102: 19144-19149Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Although an indole-based synthetic cannabinoid MDMB-Fubinaca (FUB)-bound CB1-Gi structure was determined recently (Krishna Kumar et al., 2019Krishna Kumar K. Shalev-Benami M. Robertson M.J. Hu H. Banister S.D. Hollingsworth S.A. Latorraca N.R. Kato H.E. Hilger D. Maeda S. et al.Structure of a Signaling Cannabinoid Receptor 1-G Protein Complex.Cell. 2019; 176: 448-458.e12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the activation and G protein-coupling mechanism underlying the two cannabinoid receptors CB2 and CB1 is still elusive. Here, we have used single-particle cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) and obtained the structures of agonist-bound CB2 and CB1 in complex with the heterotrimeric protein Gi as well as the crystal structure of agonist-bound CB2 by X-ray crystallography method. Together with our previously reported crystal structures of CB1 and CB2, we have, so far, determined structures of CB1 and CB2 in their inactive, active-like, and active states. Comparing the six cannabinoid receptor structures together with several other solved G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) structures in complex with Gi/o, Gs, or G11 proteins, this study provides comprehensive insights into the diverse activation and means by which cannabinoid receptors couple to G proteins and opens up avenues for the rational design of new selective ligands, especially agonists, to precisely modulate the endocannabinoid systems. To prepare the stable CB2-Gi (Gαiβγ) complexes for cryo-EM studies, we tried different modifications and ligands. Eventually, the expression level of CB2 receptor was improved by the insertion of BRIL protein at CB2’s N terminus. The stability of the CB2-Gi complex was achieved by co-expression of the receptor with the heterotrimeric Gi protein and the designed high-affinity (Ki = 0.37 nM for CB2) agonist AM12033 (Figure S1). The CB2-Gi complex was further stabilized by the addition of scFv16 (Koehl et al., 2018Koehl A. Hu H. Maeda S. Zhang Y. Qu Q. Paggi J.M. Latorraca N.R. Hilger D. Dawson R. Matile H. et al.Structure of the μ-opioid receptor-Gi protein complex.Nature. 2018; 558: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Single-particle cryo-EM analysis of the frozen sample enabled us to obtain nominal global maps at 2.9 Å resolution for CB2-AM12033-Gi-scFv16 (Figure 1; Figure S2; Table S1). The ligand, receptor, and Gi in the isolated complex are clearly visible in the EM maps (Figure S2). Side chains of the majority of amino acid residues are well defined in all protein components (Figures S2C and S2D). Thus, the structure provides an accurate model of intermolecular interactions of CB2 with the agonist and Gi.Figure 1Cryo-EM Structures of the CB1-Gi and CB2-Gi ComplexesShow full caption(A) Cryo-EM density maps of the CB1-Gi and CB2-Gi complexes, with colored subunits.

The same method was applied in obtaining the CB1-AM841-Gi-scFv16 complex cryo-EM structure at 3.0 Å resolution and the only differences is that the CB1-Gi complex was constituted in vitro from purified protein components using the THC-like cannabinoid agonist AM841(Hua et al., 2017Hua T. Vemuri K. Nikas S.P. Laprairie R.B. Wu Y. Qu L. Pu M. Korde A. Jiang S. Ho J.H. et al.Crystal structures of agonist-bound human cannabinoid receptor CB1.Nature. 2017; 547: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) instead of in vivo co-expression for CB2-Gi complex. In addition, the agonist AM12033-bound CB2 crystal structure was also determined at 3.2 Å resolution (Table S2). The overall structure of the active CB2-Gi complex is similar to that of the active conformation of the CB1-Gi complex (Figure 2A), with root mean square deviation (RMSD) values of 1.65 Å for the whole complex, 1.26 Å for the receptors alone, and 0.41 Å for the Gi proteins. The N termini of both receptors adopt identical conformations, forming a short helix over the binding pocket. The binding poses of AM12033 in CB2 and AM841 in CB1 are superimposable. When comparing inactive and active states of CB2, we observe an outward movement of TM6 that is characteristic of receptor activation and an extension of TM5 that resulted in new interactions with Gαi (Figure 2B). Similar conformational changes are also observed in CB1-Gi complex structure (Figures S3A and S3B). These structural changes allow the G protein to engage with the receptor core. In addition, the conformations of critical residues for the receptor activation, such as D3.49R3.50Y3.51 and N7.49P7.50xxY7.53 motifs (superscripts indicate Ballesteros-Weinstein numbering for GPCRs [Ballesteros and Weinstein, 1995Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Integrated methods for the construction of three-dimensional models and computational probing of structure-function relations in G protein-coupled receptors.Methods in Neurosciences. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2196) Google Scholar]), are almost identical between the active conformations of CB2 and CB1 (Figures S3C and S3D). Different from the large conformational changes of both extracellular and intracellular domains occurring from inactive to active states in CB1 (Figure S3B), the extracellular region, including the N terminus of CB2, undergoes very minor changes during its activation (Figures 2C and 2D).Figure S3Conformational Changes of DRY and NPxxY Motifs between Inactive and Active CB1 and CB2, Related to Figures 2, 4, and 5Show full caption(A) Comparison of CB1 between active and inactive (PDB: 5TGZ) from side view.(B) Extracellular and intracellular views of superimposed CB1.

The summarized data in (F) are presented as the mean with 95% confidence intervals. The overall structure of the Gi heterotrimers in CB2 and CB1 complex structures is similar to those previously solved GPCR-Gi complexes (Figure S4). No electron density for guanosine diphosphate (GDP) is observed in the GDP-binding pocket, which is mainly formed by the β1-α1 loop (P loop) and the β6-α5 loop, suggesting that Gi is nucleotide-free in both receptor-Gi complex structures. The antibody scFv16 binds at a similar interface comprising of the αN helix of Gαi and the β-propeller of Gβ, as previously reported (Koehl et al., 2018Koehl A. Hu H. Maeda S. Zhang Y. Qu Q. Paggi J.M. Latorraca N.R. Hilger D. Dawson R. Matile H. et al.Structure of the μ-opioid receptor-Gi protein complex.Nature. 2018; 558: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The structure of the CB2-Gi complex reveals a similar mode of interaction when compared with the CB1-Gi complex. The contacts between CB2 and Gi are extensively mediated through the Gαi subunit. The primary interaction interface is composed of TM3, TM5, TM6, and ICL2 of the receptor and the α5 helix, αN helix, and αN-β1 loop of the Gαi subunit (Figure 3A). Similar to other Gi-bound GPCRs, the two large hydrophobic side chains L353 and L348 of the α5 helix from Gαi are directed toward the hydrophobic pocket. For example, the hydrophobic pocket is formed by Val2125.61, Leu2436.33, Leu2476.37, Leu2396.29, and Leu1353.54 from the cytosolic ends of TM5, TM6, and TM3 of receptor (Figure 3B). However, compared to the μOR-, A1-, 5HT1B-, and M2-Gi complexes (Draper-Joyce et al., 2018Draper-Joyce C.J. Khoshouei M. Thal D.M. Liang Y.L. Nguyen A.T.N. Furness S.G.B. Venugopal H. Baltos J.A.

Skiniotis G. Kobilka B.K. Structures of the M1 and M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor/G-protein complexes.Science. 2019; 364: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the Gi proteins in CB2- and CB1-Gi complexes are observed to have a ∼20° anticlockwise rotation (if viewed from intracellular to extracellular direction) when aligning all available receptor-G protein complex structures using CB2 structure as reference (Figures S4A and S4B). The orientation difference of the Gi proteins from CB2 and CB1 complexes may be attributed to the more extended TM5 of CB2 or CB1 where additional interactions with the α5 helix of Gαi are observed (Figure 3B). Specifically, residues Ser2225.71 and His2265.75 from CB2 or R3115.75 from CB1 formed new interactions with D337 and Q333 in α5 helix of Gαi. We hypothesize that the extra pulling force may serve to twist Gi into a more energy-favorable orientation in the CB2- and CB1-Gi complexes. While CB1 and CB2 signal through Gi, CB1 is also known to couple with Gs or Gq. After careful inspection of the residues that are involved in the receptor-Gi interactions, L222ICL2 in CB1 is found in the proximity of L194 in the β2-β3 loop, as well as I344 in α5 helix of Gαi, which established weak interactions between CB1 and Gi (Figure 3C). In contrast, equivalent residue to L222ICL2 in CB2 is P139ICL2, which is unique in class A GPCRs and not involved in the interaction with Gi (Figure 3C). Previous studies have shown that the P139ICL2 mutation of P139F, P139M, or P139L enabled CB2 to couple with Gs protein (Zheng et al., 2013Zheng C. Chen L. Chen X. He X. Yang J. Shi Y. Zhou N. The second intracellular loop of the human cannabinoid CB2 receptor governs G protein coupling in coordination with the carboxyl terminal domain.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e63262Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, the L222ICL2 (CB1) equivalent residue F139ICL2 in the β2AR-Gs structure forms extensive hydrophobic interactions with a pocket consisting of α5 helix, β2-β3 loop, and β1 strand in Gαs (Figures S4E and S4F) (Maeda et al., 2019Maeda S. Qu Q. Robertson M.J. Skiniotis G. Kobilka B.K. Structures of the M1 and M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor/G-protein complexes.Science. 2019; 364: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In agreement, L222F mutation in CB1 has been shown to increase CB1-Gs basal activity (Chen et al., 2010bChen X.P. Yang W. Fan Y. Luo J.S. Hong K. Wang Z. Yan J.F. Chen X. Lu J.X. Benovic J.L. Zhou N.M. Structural determinants in the second intracellular loop of the human cannabinoid CB1 receptor mediate selective coupling to G(s) and G(i).Br. J.

Maeda S. et al.Structure of a Signaling Cannabinoid Receptor 1-G Protein Complex.Cell. 2019; 176: 448-458.e12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, we speculate that the residue L222ICL2 in CB1 facilitates its coupling with Gs, and likely Gq as well. Concerning the interactions between ICL1, helix8 from CB2 and Gαi, we identified that Ser69 and Tyr70 in ICL1 form polar interactions with D305 in Gαi, which constrain the conformation of ICL1. In addition, ICL1 and helix8 of CB2 are in close proximity to the Gβ subunit, and the presence of multiple polar and charged amino acids at this interface suggests potential interactions. In the CB2-Gi complex, the agonist AM12033 adopts an L-shape conformation in the orthosteric binding pocket. The interactions between AM12033 and CB2 are mainly hydrophobic and aromatic, including residues from ECL2, TM3, TM5, TM6, and TM7 (Figure 4). The tricyclic tetrahydrocannabinol system of AM12033 forms π-π interactions with Phe183ECL2, Phe2817.35 and Phe942.64, and the phenolic hydroxyl at C1 forms a hydrogen bond with Ser2857.39. The alkyl chain of AM12033 extends into the long channel and forms hydrophobic interactions with residues from TM3, TM5, and TM6. Prior to solving cryo-EM CB2-Gi complex structure, we have already determined the AM12033-bound CB2 crystal structure at 3.2 Å resolution (Figure 4A) where the binding pose of AM12033 can be unambiguously defined, owing to the clear electron density in the orthosteric ligand-binding pocket. The competitive binding of AM12033 is in agreement with cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) functional assay (Figures S3E and S3F). The agonist AM12033 in both cryo-EM and crystal structures shares almost identical binding poses, and the surrounding residues take similar conformations as well (Figure S5A). Notably, the binding pockets of agonist AM12033 and antagonist AM10257 in CB2 share a high degree of similarity, as speculated in our previous report (Li et al., 2019Li X. Hua T. Vemuri K. Ho J.H.

In the AM12033-Gi-bound CB2 structure, the side chain of “toggle switch” residue Trp2586.48 experiences an expected major conformational change (Figure 4D) and a large outward movement of the intracellular part of TM6 by 11 Å (Arg238 as reference) to accommodate the mounting of α5 from the Gαi protein (Figure 5A). Moreover, the cytoplasmic portion of TM5 extended and moved outward by about 6 Å (V220 as reference) to form extensive interactions with the α5 of the Gαi, as discussed above. However, the cytoplasmic region of TM5 in CB1 is simply extended during activation (Figure 5B). The larger movement of TM5 in CB2 may be attributed to Gly2105.59 (Met2955.59 in CB1) that provides extra bending flexibility of TM5 (Figure 5C). Additionally, the classical activation features in class A GPCRs are also observed here, including the rearrangement of “microswitches” DRY and NPxxY motifs (Figures S3C and S3D) (Erlandson et al., 2018Erlandson S.C. McMahon C. Kruse A.C. Structural Basis for G Protein-Coupled Receptor Signaling.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2018; (Published online March 2, 2018)https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biophys-070317-032931Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The “ionic lock” between Arg1313.50 and Asp2406.30, which is important for maintaining the ground state of the receptor (Savinainen et al., 2003Savinainen J.R. Saario S.M. Niemi R. Järvinen T. Laitinen J.T. An optimized approach to study endocannabinoid signaling: evidence against constitutive activity of rat brain adenosine A1 and cannabinoid CB1 receptors.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 140: 1451-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), is broken, and Arg1313.50 in the DRY motif extends toward TM7 and forms a hydrogen bond with G352 from the α5-helix of Gαi. A 4 Å inward displacement of the NPxxY motif (N2957.49, P2967.50, and Y2997.52) in TM7 induces the conformational change of helix 8 and ICL1, eventually leading to the closer interaction between the receptor and Gi. The overall structure of AM841-CB1-Gi is similar to our previously solved AM841-bound CB1 crystal structure (Hua et al., 2017Hua T. Vemuri K. Nikas S.P. Laprairie R.B. Wu Y. Qu L. Pu M. Korde A. Jiang S. Ho J.H. et al.Crystal structures of agonist-bound human cannabinoid receptor CB1.Nature. 2017; 547: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The main differences occur in the CB1-G protein interface where the interacting residues are stabilized by Gi. In addition, elongation of TM5 and inward movement of TM5, TM6, ICL1, and ICL2 in the intracellular region resulted in more polar and hydrophobic interactions with α5 of the Gαi protein (Figure S5D).

The endocannabinoid system (ECS) includes two major G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), cannabinoid receptor subtypes 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2), which mediate the biophysiological activities of the phytocannabinoid Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and several endogenous cannabinoids. ECS is a complex and homeostatic system that is involved in a broad spectrum of physiological and pathological processes such as appetite regulation (Kirkham, 2005Kirkham T.C.

Efforts have been made to develop selective CB1 and CB2 ligands that can modulate these biological functions and treat associated diseases. Although some CB2-selective agonists have been developed, showing certain efficacy in animal models or in vitro assays (Leleu-Chavain et al., 2019Leleu-Chavain N. Baudelet D. Heloire V.M. Rocha D.E.

Med.

Latest advances in novel cannabinoid CB(2) ligands for drug abuse and their therapeutic potential.Future Med. Chem. 2012; 4: 187-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As a therapeutic target, CB2 has a notable advantage over CB1 in its pattern of expression. CB1 is primarily expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and is the primary receptor responsible for the psychotropic effects of THC and the deleterious psychiatric side effects of CB1-targeting drugs. The CB1 inverse agonists rimonabant and taranabant (MK-0364) were developed as anti-obesity drugs, but both produce crippling CNS side effects of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation (Aronne et al., 2010Aronne L.J.

Psychiatry. 2009; 31: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and were consequently either withdrawn from the market or dropped in clinical trials. In contrast, CB2 is predominantly expressed in peripheral tissues of the immune system, such as the spleen and thymus, where it modulates immune suppression, apoptosis, and cell migration (Yang et al., 2012aYang P. Myint K.Z. Tong Q. Feng R. Cao H. Almehizia A.A. Alqarni M.H. Wang L. Bartlow P.

Casellas P. Expression of central and peripheral cannabinoid receptors in human immune tissues and leukocyte subpopulations.Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). Modest levels of CB2 expression have also been observed in several areas of the brain, such as ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons and hippocampal CA3 neurons (Onaivi et al., 2006Onaivi E.S. Ishiguro H. Gong J.P. Patel S. Perchuk A. Meozzi P.A. Myers L. Mora Z. Tagliaferro P. Gardner E. et al.Discovery of the presence and functional expression of cannabinoid CB2 receptors in brain.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2006; 1074: 514-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), which regulate cravings of drug addiction and memory processes, respectively (Chen et al., 2017Chen D.-J. Gao M. Gao F.-F. Su Q.-X. Wu J. Brain cannabinoid receptor 2: expression, function and modulation.Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2017; 38: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, it is believed that targeting the CB2 receptor and CB2 structure-based design offer promising avenues of new drug discovery for treatment of a number of disorders while avoiding the severe psychiatric side effects associated with CB1 (Seely et al., 2011Seely K.A. Prather P.L. James L.P. Moran J.H. Marijuana-based drugs: innovative therapeutics or designer drugs of abuse?.Mol. Interv. 2011; 11: 36-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Activated CB2 mainly couples to the Gi/o family and induces Gi/o-mediated signaling pathways, although Gq/11 coupling has also been reported (Ibsen et al., 2017Ibsen M.S. Connor M. Glass M. Cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 Receptor Signaling and Bias.Cannabis Cannabinoid Res. 2017; 2: 48-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CB2 antagonists and inverse agonists have been reported to promote osteoclast apoptosis and prevent bone loss (Idris et al., 2005Idris A.I. van ’t Hof R.J. Greig I.R. Ridge S.A. Baker D. Ross R.A. Ralston S.H. Regulation of bone mass, bone loss and osteoclast activity by cannabinoid receptors.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 774-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a large body of evidence has indicated a broad therapeutic application of CB2 agonists in neurodegenerative disorders (Aso and Ferrer, 2016Aso E. Ferrer I.

However, lack of a well-defined CB2 ligand activation and signaling mechanism has hindered development of synthetic CB2 agonists. WIN 55,212-2 ((R)-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-(4-morpholinylmethyl)pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]-1-naphthalenylmethanone) is a representative agonist of the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 (Ki = 62.3 nM and 3.3 nM, respectively), and it has been used extensively to investigate cannabinoid receptor function. In animal models, WIN 55,212-2 has demonstrated efficacy in treating several disease states, including pain (Mohammadi Vosough et al., 2019Mohammadi Vosough E. Baradaran Rahimi V. Masoud S.A. Mirkarimi H.R. Demneh M.K. Abed A. Banafshe H.R. Askari V.R.

Unlike most CB1 and CB2 agonists, WIN 55,212-2 activates G protein signaling pathways without eliciting CB2 internalization, a property that putatively avoids drug tolerance development. Here we report a 3.2-Å cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of human CB2 bound to the potent agonist WIN 55,212-2 in complex with Gi. Analyses of the ligand binding pocket, the CB2-Gi signaling complex, and conformational dynamics of activated CB2 are conducted by comparisons and contrasts with previously reported structures of inverse agonist-bound CB2 and inverse agonist or agonist-bound CB1. We developed and applied an innovative residual energy calculation algorithm to aid in the design of a pair of selective CB2 agonist and inverse agonist to validate our putative mechanism of receptor activation involving the structural arrangement of critical residues. Our results provide insightful information to facilitate structure-based design and discovery of high-affinity and/or high-selectivity CB2 ligands that can be developed as CB2-targeting therapeutic agents. To obtain a stable complex of CB2 bound to WIN 55,212-2 and Gi, we co-expressed human CB2 with heterotrimeric Gi protein in insect cells (Figure S1). The receptor-Gi complexes were assembled on the membrane by incubation with WIN 55,212-2 and apyrase. In addition, the antibody fragment scFv16 was added to stabilize the nucleotide-free Gi complex by binding to the interface between Gαi and Gβ (Maeda et al., 2018Maeda S. Koehl A. Matile H. Hu H. Hilger D. Schertler G.F.X. Manglik A. Skiniotis G. Dawson R.J.P. Kobilka B.K. Development of an antibody fragment that stabilizes GPCR/G-protein complexes.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 3712Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The CB2-WIN 55,212-2-Gi-scFv16 complex was then purified through sequential steps of affinity chromatography to homogeneity, yielding a relatively thermostable complex suitable for single-particle cryo-EM analysis (Figure S1). The structure of the CB2-WIN 55,212-2-Gi-scFv16 complex (Figure 1) was determined from 772,000 particles to a nominal resolution of 3.2 Å (Figure S2), which allowed unambiguous assignment of the transmembrane domain (TMD) of CB2, Gi protein, as well as the antibody fragment in the EM density maps (Figure S3). The α-helical domain (AHD) of Gαi, which is poorly resolved in most cryo-EM GPCR-G protein complex structures, is resolved in our CB2-Gi complex structure with a relatively low resolution compared with that of the core structure of this complex. The overall structures were built by rigid body fit of an online homology building model (Kelley et al., 2015Kelley L.A. Mezulis S. Yates C.M. Wass M.N. Sternberg M.J. The Phyre2 web portal for protein modeling, prediction and analysis.Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (4525) Google Scholar). Apart from the AHD of the Gi protein, the majority of the amino acid side chains were well resolved in the final models against the EM density map with excellent geometry (Table S1).Figure S2Cryo-EM Data Collection and Structure Determination, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Representative micrographs CB2-WIN 55,212-2-Gi-scFv16 complex with particles of 190 Å diameter highlighted in a green circle.(B) Representative images of 2D class-averages.(C) Cryo-electron microscopy data processing workflow by cryoSPARC to generate an unbiased Ab initio 3D map.

The EM density map shows the binding mode of the CB2 agonist WIN 55,212-2 in the orthosteric binding site in the TMD of CB2. The orientation of the agonist was determined with the electron density and the chemical and geometric constraints of the binding pocket of CB2 (Figure 2). To further validate the binding pose of WIN 55,212-2 in the ligand-binding pocket of CB2, we conducted molecular docking (Figure S4A) using three different software packages or algorithms: Schrödinger-Glide, Auto Dock, and SYBYL-Surflex Dock. The pose of WIN 55,212-2 depicted in our complex structure (Figure S4A) was scored as the top one or two from all three algorithms with the lowest binding energies. We also performed a molecular dynamics simulation, and the results showed that the pose of WIN 55,212-2 in the orthosteric ligand-binding pocket of CB2 is stable (Figures S4B–S4D). The binding interface between WIN 55,212-2 and CB2 is also supported by previously reported mutagenesis-based and structural studies (Li et al., 2019Li X. Hua T. Vemuri K. Ho J.H. Wu Y. Wu L.

The stronger the interaction, the more reddish the residue is colored, while the weaker the interaction the more blueish the residue. (D) Representative MD structure (blue cartoon and brownish sticks), having the smallest RMSD to the average structure of MD snapshots, aligned to the Cryo-EM structure (gray cartoon and greenish sticks). As shown in Figure 2, the binding pocket of WIN 55,212-2, buried in the transmembrane (TM) region, is formed by residues from TM2–TM3 and TM5–TM7 and capped by extracellular loop 2 (ECL2). The naphthalene moiety of WIN 55,212-2 extends between TM2 and TM3 and is predicted to form strong π-π interactions with F912.61 and F942.64 and hydrophobic interactions with F872.57, H952.65, P184ECL2, and F2817.35. These results are consistent with the findings from Li et al., 2019Li X. Hua T. Vemuri K. Ho J.H. Wu Y. Wu L. Popov P. Benchama O. Zvonok N. Locke K. et al.Crystal Structure of the Human Cannabinoid Receptor CB2.Cell. 2019; 176: 459-467.e13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, who reported that F872.57, F912.61, F942.64, and H952.65 in TM2 are important for recognition of the CB2 antagonist AM10257. Furthermore, our cryo-EM data reveal that the core structure of WIN 55,212-2 (2,3-dihydro-[1,4]oxazino[2,3,4-hi]indole) points downward and engages in π-π interactions with F1173.36 and W2586.48. It also interacts with I1103.29, V1133.32, F183ECL2, V2616.51, and M2656.55 via hydrophobic interactions, which have been shown previously to play key roles in ligand binding of CB2. The morpholine moiety of WIN 55,212-2, which adopts the chair conformation, approaches TM5 and ECL2 to form additional hydrophobic interactions with critical residues that have been reported to function in ligand binding (Feng et al., 2014Feng Z. Alqarni M.H. Yang P. Tong Q. Chowdhury A. Wang L. Xie X.-Q. Modeling, molecular dynamics simulation, and mutation validation for structure of cannabinoid receptor 2 based on known crystal structures of GPCRs.J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2014; 54: 2483-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), including F183ECL2, I186ECL2, and W1945.43. WIN 55,212-2 has a certain similarity to the antagonist AM10257 in binding to the receptor, but noteworthy differences also exist. From the structural alignment shown in Figure 3A, we may infer that AM10257 (antagonist) and WIN 55,212-2 (agonist) share a similar binding pocket and that most of the interactions with the receptor are conserved (Figure 3A). In addition, the volume of the WIN 55,212-2 binding site within active CB2 (∼415 Å3) is similar to that of the AM10257 binding site (antagonist, ∼447 Å3). One significant difference is that AM10257 (antagonist; Figure 3A, orange sticks) inserts deeper (2.8 Å) into the binding pocket compared with WIN 55,212-2 (agonist; Figure 3A, cyan sticks), which results in different conformations of the toggle switch residue W2586.48. W2586.48 is a highly conserved residue in class A GPCRs and has been reported to have a crucial role in GPCR activation (Lin and Sakmar, 1996Lin S.W. Sakmar T.P. Specific tryptophan UV-absorbance changes are probes of the transition of rhodopsin to its active state.Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11149-11159Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In comparison with the inactive CB2, our data showed that W2586.48 undergoes a 64° clockwise rotation and F1173.36 a 10° counterclockwise rotation in the active CB2 (Figures 3A and 3B). We also noted that the distance between W2586.48 and WIN 55,212-2 is about 5.0 Å, greater than that observed for AM10257 (∼3.8 Å). Therefore, the steric effects of CB2 ligands on W2586.48 appear to play critical roles in determining ligand efficacy. To further explore the role of critical residues on CB2 activation, we calculated the individual residue energy contribution to determine how much certain residues contribute to the binding of WIN 55,212-2. Briefly, the total binding energy of WIN 55,212-2 at CB2 is the sum of intra-ligand free energy (the energy of WIN 55,212-2) and inter-ligand free energy (the energy between WIN 55,212-2 and residues in CB2), with the latter component further divided into energy contributions from each residue. We quantitatively calculated and compared the residual energy contributions between the inactive and active CB2. Although most of the residues contribute equally to recognition of both antagonist-AM10257 (Figure 3C, green bars) and agonist-WIN 55,212-2 (Figure 3C, magenta bars), three residues, W1945.43, F1173.36, and W2586.48, were found to potentially play important roles in distinguishing agonist from antagonist. This occurs in a manner not requiring direct interaction because they are too far from the WIN 55,212-2 molecule to significantly contribute to its recognition as an agonist (Figure 3C).

Crucially, animal behavior in natural settings implies that the brain can represent hypothetical future experience not only quickly but also constantly over time, as external events continually unfold. To determine how this is possible, we recorded neural activity in the hippocampus of rats navigating a maze with multiple spatial paths. We found neural activity encoding two possible future scenarios (two upcoming maze paths) in constant alternation at 8 Hz: one scenario per ∼125-ms cycle. Further, we found that the underlying dynamics of cycling (both inter- and intra-cycle dynamics) generalized across qualitatively different representational correlates (location and direction). Notably, cycling occurred across moving behaviors, including during running. These findings identify a general dynamic process capable of quickly and continually representing hypothetical experience, including that of multiple possible futures."
https://openalex.org/W3004208933,"Admixture has played a prominent role in shaping patterns of human genomic variation, including gene flow with now-extinct hominins like Neanderthals and Denisovans. Here, we describe a novel probabilistic method called IBDmix to identify introgressed hominin sequences, which, unlike existing approaches, does not use a modern reference population. We applied IBDmix to 2,504 individuals from geographically diverse populations to identify and analyze Neanderthal sequences segregating in modern humans. Strikingly, we find that African individuals carry a stronger signal of Neanderthal ancestry than previously thought. We show that this can be explained by genuine Neanderthal ancestry due to migrations back to Africa, predominately from ancestral Europeans, and gene flow into Neanderthals from an early dispersing group of humans out of Africa. Our results refine our understanding of Neanderthal ancestry in African and non-African populations and demonstrate that remnants of Neanderthal genomes survive in every modern human population studied to date."

Here, we engineer AEC2s from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in vitro and use time-series single-cell RNA sequencing with lentiviral barcoding to profile the kinetics of their differentiation in comparison to primary fetal and adult AEC2 benchmarks. We observe bifurcating cell-fate trajectories as primordial lung progenitors differentiate in vitro, with some progeny reaching their AEC2 fate target, while others diverge to alternative non-lung endodermal fates. We develop a Continuous State Hidden Markov model to identify the timing and type of signals, such as overexuberant Wnt responses, that induce some early multipotent NKX2-1+ progenitors to lose lung fate. Finally, we find that this initial developmental plasticity is regulatable and subsides over time, ultimately resulting in PSC-derived AEC2s that exhibit a stable phenotype and nearly limitless self-renewal capacity."

However, viral escape through mutation of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) limits clinical applications. Here we describe 1-18, a new VH1-46-encoded CD4 binding site (CD4bs) bNAb with outstanding breadth (97%) and potency (GeoMean IC50 = 0.048 μg/mL). Notably, 1-18 is not susceptible to typical CD4bs escape mutations and effectively overcomes HIV-1 resistance to other CD4bs bNAbs. Moreover, mutational antigenic profiling uncovered restricted pathways of HIV-1 escape. Of most promise for therapeutic use, even 1-18 alone fully suppressed viremia in HIV-1-infected humanized mice without selecting for resistant viral variants. A 2.5-Å cryo-EM structure of a 1-18-BG505SOSIP.664 Env complex revealed that these characteristics are likely facilitated by a heavy-chain insertion and increased inter-protomer contacts. The ability of 1-18 to effectively restrict HIV-1 escape pathways provides a new option to successfully prevent and treat HIV-1 infection."

Microbial diversity is ultimately manifested at the finest taxonomic resolution: individual strains of a microbial species can exhibit widely diverse phenotypes.

Zhao L. Strain-level dissection of the contribution of the gut microbiome to human metabolic disease.Genome Med. 2016; 8: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, subsequent diversification of strains within an individual—one’s own intrinsic bacterial population diversity—is little understood, largely due to the limitations in the sequencing depth of metagenomic studies and sample sizes of culture-based studies. The most fundamental questions are how diverse are within-individual bacterial populations, what begets and then maintains this diversity (if it exists), and what is the impact on human health? We can further delineate the question of population diversity by asking whether founding lineages, once established, further diverge within and between skin sites, or is there continual transmission and genetic exchange across the body and evolution over time? Are there functional consequences of genetic diversification, such as niche specialization or the dissemination of ABR or virulence factors? How are they affected by horizontal gene transfer (HGT)? Finally, does the surrounding microbiota affect the diversity of a focal population or provide additional opportunities for genetic exchange by HGT? Addressing these questions requires high-quality whole-genome sequences for tracking evolutionary processes, broad skin-site representation with sufficient sampling depth to assess prevalence of microbial features at each site, and paired metagenomic data to interrogate the influence of environmental factors. To date, nearly all large-scale studies investigating microbial population diversity have done so using isolates obtained from different individuals, disease sites, or environments to identify interpersonal/environmental transmission events or identify virulence characteristics of infectious disease-associated isolates. Yet recent studies of gut microbes suggest the biological significance of within-host evolution (Zhao et al., 2019Zhao S. Lieberman T.D. Poyet M. Kauffman K.M. Gibbons S.M. Groussin M. Xavier R.J. Alm E.J. Adaptive Evolution within Gut Microbiomes of Healthy People.Cell Host Microbe. 2019; 25: 656-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this study, we present a detailed analysis on the within-individual spatiotemporal diversity of S. epidermidis. S. epidermidis is ubiquitous yet of low abundance in human skin (Oh et al., 2014Oh J. Byrd A.L. Deming C. Conlan S. Kong H.H. Segre J.A. NISC Comparative Sequencing ProgramBiogeography and individuality shape function in the human skin metagenome.Nature. 2014; 514: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), thus particularly intractable for metagenomic approaches for inferring strain diversity (Oh et al., 2014Oh J.

Huttenhower C. Segata N. Microbial strain-level population structure and genetic diversity from metagenomes.Genome Res. 2017; 27: 626-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition, its extensive genomic heterogeneity (Conlan et al., 2012Conlan S. Mijares L.A. Becker J. Blakesley R.W. Bouffard G.G. Brooks S. Coleman H. Gupta J. Gurson N. Park M. et al.NISC Comparative Sequencing ProgramStaphylococcus epidermidis pan-genome sequence analysis reveals diversity of skin commensal and hospital infection-associated isolates.Genome Biol. 2012; 13: R64Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) makes it a strong candidate for HGT and ecological niche specialization. Indeed, the complexity of the human skin’s microenvironments, which encompass dry, moist, and oily sites and correspondingly different compositions of the contextual microbiota (Oh et al., 2014Oh J. Byrd A.L. Deming C. Conlan S. Kong H.H. Segre J.A. NISC Comparative Sequencing ProgramBiogeography and individuality shape function in the human skin metagenome.Nature. 2014; 514: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), provides unique opportunities for local S. epidermidis to functionally specialize. Moreover, host-specific behaviors can foster or curb microbial transmission, with frequent physical contacts between some skin sites and near-isolation from others (e.g., nares from foot). We generated a whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing dataset of 1,482 S. epidermidis isolates cultured from 16 skin sites from five healthy males and females at 2–4 time points over a month (Table S1; Figure S1). We paired the isolate sequencing data with 153 metagenomic whole-genome shotgun (mWGS) sequencing data samples collected from the same skin sites to explore how the contextual skin microbiome may shape S. epidermidis genetic diversity. Our study reveals a remarkable spatiotemporal diversity and genetic exchange of S. epidermidis within each individual. We experimentally show that this genetic admixture can suppress virulence and regulation of metabolic pathways, suggesting an evolutionary mechanism by which genetically diverse strains can co-exist in the skin. Broadly, we identified patterns of population-level diversity that are both skin site specific and subject specific and determined how such diversity patterns resulted from different evolutionary (e.g., point mutation, HGT) and demographic processes (e.g., transmission across skin sites). 1,629 S. epidermidis clones were isolated from five healthy males and females from 16 defined anatomical skin sites (Table S1 for skin-site nomenclatures, “_L” indicated the left side of the body and “_R” the right) at 2–4 time points (denoted as T1–T4) over a month, with ∼10 isolates sampled at random and sequenced per site/time point/subject. After sequencing, assembly, and quality filtering (Figure S1), 1,482 S. epidermidis draft genomes (median genome size = 2.49 Mbp (range 2.20–2.78 Mbp) were reconstructed at median 101.6× coverage (17.7–794.9×), hereafter referred to as the “subject isolates.” In addition, total DNA was isolated from 153 matched skin swab specimens for metagenomic library preparation and sequencing (median reads after quality filtering and removal of human DNA = 1,850,938 (377,256–26,290,470, Table S1). Microbial populations on the human skin can be derived from a single founding member over one’s lifetime in the absence of major perturbations (a single colonizer hypothesis) or alternatively colonized by multiple founder lineages. These hypothetical processes are distinguishable depending on whether isolates sampled from different individuals have distinct most recent common ancestors (MRCAs)—suggesting a single colonization event in each individual, such as that observed for B. fragilis in the human gut (Zhao et al., 2019Zhao S. Lieberman T.D. Poyet M. Kauffman K.M. Gibbons S.M. Groussin M. Xavier R.J. Alm E.J. Adaptive Evolution within Gut Microbiomes of Healthy People.Cell Host Microbe. 2019; 25: 656-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)—or not, suggesting the presence of multiple founder lineages (Figure 1A). Here, we reconstructed the molecular phylogeny based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the core genome (regions conserved across all isolates) from our 1,482 subject isolates (Table S1) and 50 publicly deposited, high-quality S. epidermidis genomes sampled from healthy and diseased individuals (Conlan et al., 2012Conlan S. Mijares L.A. Becker J. Blakesley R.W. Bouffard G.G. Brooks S. Coleman H. Gupta J. Gurson N.

Collectively, S. epidermidis isolates formed two major phylogenetic clades (Figure 1B), similar to previous observations (Conlan et al., 2012Conlan S. Mijares L.A. Becker J. Blakesley R.W. Bouffard G.G. Brooks S. Coleman H. Gupta J. Gurson N.

NISC Comparative Sequencing ProgramBiogeography and individuality shape function in the human skin metagenome.Nature. 2014; 514: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, isolates from each subject, as well as the 50 public isolates, shared a MRCA, suggesting the presence of multiple founder lineages (Figures 1B and 1C). This observation revealed that unlike B. fragilis, diversity within founder lineages is maintained in S. epidermidis, resulting in broad phylogenetic representation within a single host. Moreover, subject isolates exhibited subject- and skin-site-specific phylogenetic structuring (Figure 1D, PERMANOVA based on cophenetic distances, p = 0.001 for skin sites, subjects, and their interaction term). Strikingly, all toeweb isolates spanned a limited phylogenetic space not only within each of the five subjects but also between subjects (Figure 1D). Such uniformity in phylogenetic similarity of toeweb isolates was unlikely due to stochastic mechanisms (e.g., population bottleneck), suggesting a stronger purifying selection favoring the growth of a particular genetic configuration. An evolutionary process particularly relevant to skin microbes is transmission of bacteria across environmental barriers, which can further modulate the genetic diversity landscape (Brito and Alm, 2016Brito I.L.

Migration and horizontal gene transfer divide microbial genomes into multiple niches.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 8924Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Indeed, sister isolates—isolates with 0 core-genome nucleotide differences, likely representing recent descendants of the same lineage—were observed at different skin sites (Figure 2A). Although the number of shared sister isolates could be skewed due to sampling depth and the overall frequency of sister isolates within a population, it is highly unlikely for isolates observed at different skin sites to accumulate the same alleles at all core-genome SNP loci (n = 58,498). Therefore, the presence of shared sister isolates heuristically supports the presence of recent transmission events. However, shared sister isolates cannot be used to infer historical transmissions nor provide quantitative estimates of transmission rate. To quantitatively estimate and compare transmission between skin sites, we inferred transmission events along a phylogenetic tree using Bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees (BEAST) (Suchard et al., 2018Suchard M.A. Lemey P. Baele G. Ayres D.L. Drummond A.J. Rambaut A. Bayesian phylogenetic and phylodynamic data integration using BEAST 1.10.Virus Evol. 2018; 4: vey016Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BEAST represented transmission events as switches in node states (for example, see Figure S2A), and estimated transmission probability by sampling many time-calibrated phylogenetic trees (n = 2,000 in this study). Based on the time calibration, isolates from each subject diverged from multiple ancestral nodes that were older than the subject (Figure S2B) and suggested that the S. epidermidis population on a given subject was likely established by at least 12–20 founder strains (Figure S2B). The diverse founder strains then further diverged into the isolates observed in this study, at least partially explaining their broad phylogenetic representation (Figure 1B).Figure S2Bayesian Inference of Evolutionary History, Related to Figure 2 and STAR MethodsShow full caption(A) Maximum clade credibility tree annotated with historical transmission events.

The highlighted data points indicate either the umbilicus or toeweb in a pairwise comparison. (D) Consistency of Bayes factors (upper) and posterior probabilities (lower) supporting pairwise transmission events estimated from two independent MCMC runs. We then estimated the probability of transmission between each pair of skin sites, resulting in a probabilistic transmission map of within-individual S. epidermidis on the human skin (Figure 2B). Both the transmission map and the previous heuristic method (Figure 2A) revealed that (1) transmission occurs frequently between facial sites and hand sites, which are relatively exposed, (2) transmission patterns are subject specific, and (3) the umbilicus and toeweb were relatively isolated from the rest of the skin sites. For the toeweb and umbilicus, the lack of transmission can result in distinct S. epidermidis gene contents in these subpopulations (Figure S2C). Interestingly, in subject p3, which had relatively few shared sister isolates (Figure 2A), transmission between facial and hand sites was still frequent (Figure 2B), consistent with the presence of closely related isolates with few (but not 0) SNPs at different skin sites (Figure 1D). Biologically, this could be due to larger effective population sizes in p3, which decreased the probability of observing sister isolates shared between skin sites. Note that the heuristic method (Figure 2A) and the probabilistic transmission map (Figure 2B) showed some incongruencies for a subset of skin sites; this is because the heuristic method reports sharing of sister isolates “as it is,” while the probabilistic transmission analyses additionally infer the transmission rates that are necessary to explain the data through variable selection (see STAR Methods). Altogether, these findings suggested that topography is an important determinant of S. epidermidis population diversity in the skin and is further shaped by transmission between sites such as the hand and the face, or geographic isolation, as for the umbilicus and toeweb. Gene content diversification—likely driven both by transmission and natural selection—is important because it indicates the functional capacity of a given isolate and also how that capacity is constrained within a host, is associated with skin sites, and fluctuates over time. Previous metagenomic studies have suggested host- and skin-site specificity of strain-specific gene content (Tett et al., 2017Tett A. Pasolli E. Farina S. Truong D.T. Asnicar F. Zolfo M. Beghini F. Armanini F. Jousson O. De Sanctis V. et al.Unexplored diversity and strain-level structure of the skin microbiome associated with psoriasis.NPJ Biofilms Microbiomes. 2017; 3: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); here, we leveraged our large isolate dataset to test these hypotheses. Isolates sampled from each subject constituted relatively closed pan-genomes with comparable sizes across the subjects (Figure 3A), suggesting a limited repertoire of within-individual gene content. Conversely, this gene content showed considerable subject specificity. Only 55.4%–65.1% of the S. epidermidis gene clusters observed in a given subject (i.e., the subject-specific pan-genome) and 58.0%–80.5% of the gene clusters observed in all isolates of a given subject (i.e., the subject-specific core-genome) were shared between all five subjects, and 9.5%–15.6% of gene clusters were entirely unique to a subject (Figure 3B). These findings suggested a personalization of gene content at the population level: while the S. epidermidis population found in a single host retains the inherent diversity from multiple founder lineages, further evolution of the S. epidermidis gene repertoire occurred in a host-specific manner. Consistent with this observation was the much greater size of the collective pan-genome of the 50 publicly available genomes (Figure 3A) and an additional 17.4% of the gene clusters unique to the public strains (Figure 3B). Put together, our results showed that, despite their wide distribution in the SNP-based phylogeny (Figure 1B), S. epidermidis within a single host had constrained gene content diversity. Ne"

Here, we report the results of the first genome-wide genetic screens in the CNS using both short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and CRISPR libraries. Our screens identify many classes of CNS neuronal essential genes and demonstrate that CNS neurons are particularly sensitive not only to perturbations to synaptic processes but also autophagy, proteostasis, mRNA processing, and mitochondrial function. These results reveal a molecular logic for the common implication of these pathways across multiple neurodegenerative diseases. To further identify disease-relevant genetic modifiers, we applied our screening approach to two mouse models of Huntington’s disease (HD).

Here, we show that hiPSC-derived NPCs from ASD individuals with macrocephaly display an altered DNA replication program and increased DNA damage. When compared with the control NPCs, high-throughput genome-wide translocation sequencing (HTGTS) demonstrates that ASD-derived NPCs harbored elevated DNA double-strand breaks in replication stress-susceptible genes, some of which are associated with ASD pathogenesis.

We trace DIX domains to unicellular eukaryotes and thus show that DIX-dependent polymerization is an ancient mechanism conserved between kingdoms and central to polarity proteins. Cell polarity is fundamental for the development of organisms across kingdoms of life. Polarity establishment involves the translation of directional cues into subcellular responses, such as local assembly of protein complexes or formation of outgrowths (St Johnston and Ahringer, 2010St Johnston D. Ahringer J. Cell polarity in eggs and epithelia: parallels and diversity.Cell. 2010; 141: 757-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In multicellular organisms, individual cell polarity additionally needs to integrate global organismal axes, and be coordinated among neighboring cells within a plane (Butler and Wallingford, 2017Butler M.T. Wallingford J.B. Planar cell polarity in development and disease.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Planar polarity ensures correct morphogenesis of tissues by regulating cell growth and differentiation, as well as through orienting structures protruding from single cells within epithelia, such as hairs and cilia (Butler and Wallingford, 2017Butler M.T. Wallingford J.B. Planar cell polarity in development and disease.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Despite the fundamental importance of cellular and planar polarity for multicellular life, it remains unclear how polarity-determining systems evolved in plants and animals. Do both kingdoms use similar mechanisms derived from their last single-celled common ancestor, or did each lineage evolve independent solutions to the same problem? Various mechanisms conferring cell polarization have been uncovered in animals. A central component in planar cell polarity (PCP) depends on Wnt signaling, transduced by Dishevelled (DVL) (Strutt, 2002Strutt D.I. The asymmetric subcellular localisation of components of the planar polarity pathway.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 13: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Wnt ligands bind to Frizzled and one of several co-receptors, which leads to the activation of distinct branches of intracellular Wnt signaling, depending on the co-receptor (Angers and Moon, 2009Angers S. Moon R.T. Proximal events in Wnt signal transduction.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The best-studied branch is mediated by β-catenin which is stabilized upon Wnt binding to Frizzled and LRP5/6 co-receptor, and thus translocates to the nucleus to co-activate Wnt-dependent gene transcription (Gammons and Bienz, 2018Gammons M. Bienz M. Multiprotein complexes governing Wnt signal transduction.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2018; 51: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Non-canonical Wnt signaling does not involve β-catenin, but instead controls various cellular processes through other signaling intermediates (Strutt, 2002Strutt D.I. The asymmetric subcellular localisation of components of the planar polarity pathway.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 13: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Central to both canonical and non-canonical signaling is the Dishevelled hub protein, which assembles Wnt signalosomes by reversible head-to-tail polymerization of its DIX domain (Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007aSchwarz-Romond T. Fiedler M. Shibata N. Butler P.J.G. Kikuchi A. Higuchi Y. Bienz M. The DIX domain of Dishevelled confers Wnt signaling by dynamic polymerization.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). DIX filaments are cross-linked by dimerization of the Dishevelled DEP domain, generating three-dimensional dynamic structures (Gammons et al., 2016aGammons M.V. Renko M. Johnson C.M. Rutherford T.J. Bienz M. Wnt signalosome assembly by DEP domain swapping of Dishevelled.Mol. Cell. 2016; 64: 92-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), akin to phase-separated protein condensates (Schaefer and Peifer, 2019Schaefer K.N. Peifer M. Wnt/Beta-Catenin Signaling Regulation and a Role for Biomolecular Condensates.Dev. Cell. 2019; 48: 429-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Dishevelled thus attains a high local concentration that enables it to interact efficiently with low-affinity signaling effectors whose normal cellular concentration is too low to interact with unpolymerized Dishevelled (Bienz, 2014Bienz M. Signalosome assembly by domains undergoing dynamic head-to-tail polymerization.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2014; 39: 487-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Signaling effectors include Axin for canonical Wnt signaling and various other proteins in non-canonical signaling (Strutt, 2002Strutt D.I. The asymmetric subcellular localisation of components of the planar polarity pathway.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 13: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, Yang and Mlodzik, 2015Yang Y.

While the importance of DIX domain-mediated polymerization is well-established in canonical Wnt signaling, its role in cell polarity signaling has not been tested. However, all available evidence suggests that the DIX domain may also be important for non-canonical signaling: for example, polar membrane-associated Dishevelled puncta (condensates) have been reported in Drosophila wing discs during PCP signaling (Axelrod, 2001Axelrod J.D. Unipolar membrane association of Dishevelled mediates Frizzled planar cell polarity signaling.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1182-1187PubMed Google Scholar, Strutt et al., 2016Strutt H. Gamage J. Strutt D. Robust asymmetric localization of planar polarity proteins is associated with organization into signalosome-like domains of variable stoichiometry.Cell Rep. 2016; 17: 2660-2671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), in C. elegans B cells (Wu and Herman, 2007Wu M. Herman M.A. Asymmetric localizations of LIN-17/Fz and MIG-5/Dsh are involved in the asymmetric B cell division in C. elegans.Dev. Biol. 2007; 303: 650-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and Xenopus embryos (Yamanaka and Nishida, 2007Yamanaka H. Nishida E. Wnt11 stimulation induces polarized accumulation of Dishevelled at apical adherens junctions through Frizzled7.Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and the DIX domain is required for polar localization in the latter two cellular contexts. Furthermore, upon deletion of its DIX domain, Drosophila Dsh behaves as a dominant-negative, producing planar polarity phenotypes in wings (Axelrod et al., 1998Axelrod J.D. Miller J.R. Shulman J.M. Moon R.T. Perrimon N. Differential recruitment of Dishevelled provides signaling specificity in the planar cell polarity and Wingless signaling pathways.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2610-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), indicating a function of this domain for PCP signaling. Plants evolved multicellularity independently from animals, and may therefore use different polarity systems. Indeed, orthologs of the well-known polarity regulators from animals or yeast are thought to be missing from plant genomes (Kania et al., 2014Kania U. Fendrych M. Friml J. Polar delivery in plants; commonalities and differences to animal epithelial cells.Open Biol. 2014; 4: 140017Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), with the exception of the Rho-of-Plants (Rop) proteins (Yang, 2008Yang Z. Cell polarity signaling in Arabidopsis.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 24: 551-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) that are important for cell morphogenesis (Yang and Lavagi, 2012Yang Z. Lavagi I. Spatial control of plasma membrane domains: ROP GTPase-based symmetry breaking.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2012; 15: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, a role for Rop proteins in polarization of dividing cells has not yet been found. Several plant-specific proteins have been linked to polarity because of their accumulation at one side of the cell. For example, PIN auxin hormone transport facilitators (Gälweiler et al., 1998Gälweiler L. Guan C. Müller A. Wisman E. Mendgen K. Yephremov A. Palme K.

Polarly localized kinase SGN1 is required for Casparian strip integrity and positioning.Nat. Plants. 2016; 2: 16113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and CASP scaffold proteins (Roppolo et al., 2011Roppolo D. De Rybel B. Dénervaud Tendon V. Pfister A. Alassimone J. Vermeer J.E.M. Yamazaki M.

A novel protein family mediates Casparian strip formation in the endodermis.Nature. 2011; 473: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) all localize to specific sides of plant cells. However, their localization is readily perturbed by experimental manipulations of transport systems or cellular trafficking (Kania et al., 2014Kania U. Fendrych M. Friml J. Polar delivery in plants; commonalities and differences to animal epithelial cells.Open Biol. 2014; 4: 140017Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and often depends on tissue context and developmental stage. As such, most currently known polar proteins are likely clients or readouts of polarity systems, rather than integral components of polarity-generating pathways. Some polar proteins, such as the BASL scaffold protein (Dong et al., 2009Dong J. MacAlister C.A. Bergmann D.C. BASL controls asymmetric cell division in Arabidopsis.Cell. 2009; 137: 1320-1330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and its partner protein BRXL2 (Rowe et al., 2019Rowe M.H. Dong J. Weimer A.K. Bergmann D.C. A plant-specific polarity module establishes cell fate asymmetry in the Arabidopsis stomatal lineage.bioRxiv. 2019; https://doi.org/10.1101/614636Crossref Google Scholar), have been shown to regulate cell polarity or asymmetric cell division. However, BASL is expressed in specific tissues and cell types exclusively of flowering plants, which makes it unlikely that it is a constituent of a universal polarity-generating mechanism. Such a mechanism may be expected to be conserved in early-diverging land plants such as mosses or liverworts; however, little is known about cell and tissue polarity in these organisms. In fact, the only polar protein that has been found in these species is the PINA protein of the moss Physcomitrella patens that shows polar localization in tip-growing cells, and bi-polar localization in leafy tissues (Viaene et al., 2014Viaene T. Landberg K. Thelander M. Medvecka E. Pederson E. Feraru E. Cooper E.D. Karimi M. Delwiche C.F.C.F. Ljung K. et al.Directional auxin transport mechanisms in early diverging land plants.Curr.

Polar delivery in plants; commonalities and differences to animal epithelial cells.Open Biol. 2014; 4: 140017Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In summary, the mechanisms that establish and integrate polarity in plants remain elusive, and it is even less clear whether plant polarity systems bear any similarity to polarity-generating signaling pathways in animals. We recently discovered a family of five paralogs called SOSEKI (SOK1–SOK5) in the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Each of these proteins displays robust polar edge localization in multiple cell types throughout development. Polar localization of SOSEKI proteins involves two conserved domains: a central domain required for membrane association that dictates localization to polar edges, and an N-terminal domain required for focused localization at these edges (Yoshida et al., 2019Yoshida S. van der Schuren A. van Dop M. van Galen L. Saiga S. Adibi M. Möller B. Ten Hove C.A. Marhavy P. Smith R. et al.A SOSEKI-based coordinate system interprets global polarity cues in Arabidopsis.Nat. Plants. 2019; 5: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain was proposed to contain a DIX domain-like fold, hinting at similarities between animal and plant cell polarity systems. Here, we discover orthologs of SOSEKI proteins across all land plants, and we show that paralogs in two bryophyte species also display polar edge localization. Furthermore, we use structural and biochemical analysis to establish that this ancient protein family contains a bona fide DIX domain—constituting the closest structural relatives of the Dishevelled DIX domain—and that these domains, like Dishevelled DIX, undergo concentration-dependent head-to-tail polymerization. We also use cross-kingdom assays to reveal functional equivalence between Dishevelled and plant DIX domains. Notably, the likely origin of DIX domains can be traced to unicellular eukaryotic ancestors. Collectively, our insights suggest an ancient origin of a phase-separating biochemical paradigm underlying cell polarity in animals and plants. The genome of the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana encodes five SOSEKI proteins, each of which shows polar localization during development (Yoshida et al., 2019Yoshida S. van der Schuren A. van Dop M. van Galen L. Saiga S. Adibi M. Möller B. Ten Hove C.A. Marhavy P. Smith R. et al.A SOSEKI-based coordinate system interprets global polarity cues in Arabidopsis.Nat. Plants. 2019; 5: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To identity other SOSEKI proteins in the plant kingdom, we searched the OneKP dataset (Matasci et al., 2014Matasci N. Hung L.-H.

This dataset encompasses RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) transcriptome assemblies from more than a thousand plants species, including both land plants and their aquatic sister group, the green algae (Matasci et al., 2014Matasci N.

To recover more distantly related sequences, we also searched the genome of the early-diverging liverwort plant Marchantia polymorpha (Bowman et al., 2017Bowman J.L. Kohchi T. Yamato K.T. Jenkins J.

SOSEKI-related sequences are widespread throughout land plants, and we thus subjected them to phylogenetic analysis. The rich species sampling in the OneKP dataset, with multiple species in each major taxonomic clade, allowed us previously to infer the plausible number of ancestral gene copies within a number of gene families at the divergence of each lineage (Mutte et al., 2018Mutte S.K. Kato H. Rothfels C. Melkonian M. Wong G.K.S. Weijers D. Origin and evolution of the nuclear auxin response system.eLife. 2018; 7: e33399Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Applying this strategy to SOSEKI proteins, we found these to be limited to land plants, and no clear homologs could be identified in algal sister groups (Figures 1A and 1B ). Thus, it is likely that SOSEKI proteins are limited to land plants, but more genome-based information will be required to confirm their absence in algae. Indeed, a single SOSEKI ancestor must have existed until a first duplication gave rise to SOK1 and SOK2–SOK5 precursors (Arabidopsis nomenclature) in the common ancestor of ferns and seed or flowering plants (Figures 1A and 1B). Subsequent duplications in flowering plants increased the number of paralogs (Figure 1A and 1B). Because RNA-seq transcriptome assemblies tend to miss genes that are weakly expressed in sampled tissue, we also searched curated genome sequences of 107 angiosperms, seven gymnosperms, a single lycophyte, and two bryophyte species (https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/plaza/). Strikingly, none of the investigated land plant species lacks SOSEKI genes (Table S1), which indicates a fundamental function of these genes in all land plants. All five Arabidopsis SOSEKI proteins show polar localization, but it is unclear whether this reflects an ancestral or derived property. To address this, we determined the subcellular localizations of SOSEKI proteins in two bryophyte species. We first localized four of the nine SOSEKI proteins found in the moss Physcomitrella patens (named PpSOK). All PpSOK genes, including one encoding a truncated protein, are derived from a single ancestral bryophyte gene by duplications within the moss ancestor, and are thus all co-orthologous to AtSOK genes (Figure S1A). We selected four genes for which expression had been documented (Ortiz-Ramírez et al., 2016Ortiz-Ramírez C. Hernandez-Coronado M. Thamm A. Catarino B. Wang M. Dolan L. Feijó J.A. Becker J.D. A Transcriptome Atlas of Physcomitrella patens Provides Insights into the Evolution and Development of Land Plants.Mol. Plant. 2016; 9: 205-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (http://bar.utoronto.ca/efp_physcomitrella/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi) for genomic tagging with a C-terminal mCitrine fluorescent protein by homologous recombination. Three of the four PpSOK proteins are expressed during the filamentous stage (protonema) of Physcomitrella development. In the tip-growing and branching cells, two of these (PpSOK1, PpSOK3) are diffuse throughout the cytosol and nucleus (Figures S1B and S1D), while the truncated PpSOK4 marks the newly formed cell walls (Figure 1C). The fourth (PpSOK2) is only expressed after the switch from filamentous to three-dimensional growth (Figure 1E and 1F). In young gametophore buds, PpSOK2 shows coordinated localization limited to the lower inner edge of bud cells (Figure 1F). In the leafy gametophores that develop from these buds, coordinated polarized PpSOK2 localization points to the leaf base and away from the leaf margin (Figure 1G). Following the switch from filamentous to three-dimensional growth, we detect a weak cytosolic signal for PpSOK1 and PpSOK3 in young gametophore buds (Figures S1C and S1E) while PpSOK4 remains localized to the cell plate (Figure 1D). Because the apical cells in young buds divide in a polarized fashion (Harrison et al., 2009Harrison C.J. Roeder A.H.K. Meyerowitz E.M. Langdale J.A. Local cues and asymmetric cell divisions underpin body plan transitions in the moss Physcomitrella patens.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 461-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), localization of SOSEKI proteins to newly formed walls in these buds will result in basal polar localization in the apical-most cell (Figure 1D). Two of the four PpSOK proteins did not show polar localization, which is likely a consequence of loss of polarity after gene duplications. However, it is also possible that the ancestral state was non-polar and some of the PpSOK proteins and all Arabidopsis SOK proteins independently gained polarity. To test if polarity is retained in a species that has only a single SOSEKI protein, we localized the single Marchantia polymorpha MpSOK protein. Because fluorescence was too weak to be detected when Citrine was fused to the C terminus of MpSOK in the context of a genomic fragment with ∼4 kb of endogenous promoter (not shown), we expressed a Citrine-MpSOK protein from the 35S promoter. In these lines, we observed clear polar localization in gemmae (Figure 1H), that appeared coordinated among cells. In summary, the only Marchantia SOSEKI protein, and two of the four tested Physcomitrella SOSEKI proteins show polarized localizations similar to their Arabidopsis counterparts. Notably, these three species are separated by 450 million years of evolution (Rensing et al., 2008Rensing S.A. Lang D. Zimmer A.D. Terry A. Salamov A. Shapiro H. Nishiyama T. Perroud P.-F. Lindquist E.A. Kamisugi Y. et al.The Physcomitrella Genome Reveals Evolutionary Insights into the Conquest of Land by Plants.Science. 2008; 319: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar), and therefore polar localization appears to be an ancestral property. Thus, SOSEKI proteins belong to an ancient polarity system common to all land plants. Mining the full set of land plant SOSEKI sequences for conserved elements, we uncovered a common domain topology, including a prominent N-terminal signature domain (part of the DUF966 Interpro domain; https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/IPR010369) (Figure 2A). Further downstream, SOSEKI proteins exhibit an invariant CG motif (Figures 2A and S2A) predicted to be a target site for palmitoylation (Ren et al., 2008Ren J. Wen L. Gao X. Jin C. Xue Y. Yao X. CSS-Palm 2.0: an updated software for palmitoylation sites prediction.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2008; 21: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), thus potentially conferring membrane association. Within their C termini, they exhibit a conserved domain that can be divided into two distinct subclasses that are mutually exclusive among different orthologs and paralogs (Figures 2A and S2A). One of these subclasses bears a C2HC zinc finger (ZnF) signature, found in bryophyte and lycophyte SOSEKI and in the AtSOK1 clade of vascular plants, while the other subclass, found in AtSOK2–AtSOK5 orthologs of vascular plants, bears a central KEY motif (Figures 2A and S2A). However, several residues are highly conserved in both elements (e.g., two invariant charged residues and five hydrophobic residues, including one of the ZnF signature cysteines; Figure S2A), suggesting a shared structural fold (to be called KEY/ZnF domain). Notably, early land plants exclusively encode ZnF-bearing SOSEKI orthologs, suggesting that AtSOK1 typifies the ancestral protein.Figure S2Conserved SOSEKI Elements and Localizations of Mutant SOK1-YFP, Related to Figures 2 and 3Show full caption(A) Amino acid logos of conserved elements in plant SOSEKI proteins.(B and C) Representative confocal images as in main Figures 2B–2G, revealing subcellular localizations of C233A (B) and H29D/D78R (C) mutant SOK1-YFP, as indicated in panels.

We previously used a misexpression system based on the RPS5A promoter to demonstrate the functional relevance of the N-terminal DUF966 domain in AtSOK1 (Yoshida et al., 2019Yoshida S. van der Schuren A. van Dop M. van Galen L. Saiga S. Adibi M. Möller B. Ten Hove C.A. Marhavy P. Smith R. et al.A SOSEKI-based coordinate system interprets global polarity cues in Arabidopsis.Nat. Plants. 2019; 5: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). When misexpressed, SOK1 localizes to polar edges in any cell it is expressed in, and this misexpression induces aberrations in cell division orientation (Figure 2B; 70% of independent transgenics show at least one abnormal cell division plane in median cross-section; n = 37), which serves as a readout for biological activity of the SOK1 protein. To examine the functions of SOSEKI elements, we misexpressed tagged AtSOK1 (SOK1-YFP) and AtSOK5 (SOK5-YFP) with the same system, which mediates ubiquitous polar localization across the root meristem (Figures 2B and 2C). Point mutations of the CG motif cause delocalization of SOK1-YFP (C233A and C233A/G234A) and SOK5-YFP (C303A) from cell membranes (Figures 2D, 2E, and S2B), indicating that this motif is essential for membrane association. Likewise, the C233A and C233A/G234A mutations in SOK1 also impaired its ability to alter cell division planes (Figure 2D; 18%; n = 45). However, we were unable to detect any changes in the localization or biological activity of SOK1-YFP bearing a mutant ZnF motif (C307A/C310A; Figure 2F; 62%; n = 61) nor in SOK5-YFP bearing a mutant KEY motif (E356Q/E359Q; Figure 2G), suggesting that these motifs are either dispensable for polar localization in our overexpression system, or that the"

EPH receptors comprise the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and modulate a diverse range of developmental processes and human diseases. However, the role of C1GALT1 in the signaling of EPH receptors remains largely overlooked. Here, we showed that C1GALT1 high expression in gastric adenocarcinomas correlated with adverse clinicopathologic features and is an independent prognostic factor for poor overall survival. Silencing or loss of C1GALT1 inhibited cell viability, migration, invasion, tumor growth and metastasis, as well as increased apoptosis and cytotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil in AGS and MKN45 cells. Phospho-RTK array and western blot analysis showed that C1GALT1 depletion suppressed tyrosine phosphorylation of EPHA2 induced by soluble Ephrin A1-Fc. O-glycans on EPHA2 were modified by C1GALT1 and both S277A and T429A mutants, which are O-glycosites on EPHA2, dramatically enhanced phosphorylation of Y588, suggesting that not only overall O-glycan structures but also site-specific O-glycosylation can regulate EPHA2 activity. Furthermore, depletion of C1GALT1 decreased Ephrin A1-Fc induced migration and reduced Ephrin A1 binding to cell surfaces. The effects of C1GALT1 knockdown or knockout on cell invasiveness in vitro and in vivo were phenocopied by EPHA2 knockdown in gastric cancer cells. These results suggest that C1GALT1 promotes phosphorylation of EPHA2 and enhances soluble Ephrin A1-mediated migration primarily by modifying EPHA2 O-glycosylation. Our study highlights the importance of GalNAc-type O-glycosylation in EPH receptor-regulated diseases and identifies C1GALT1 as a potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3004457953,"Melatonin, a hormone secreted by pineal gland, exerts antimetastatic effects by reducing tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that play a crucial role in regulation of gene expression and biological processes of the cells. Herein, we search for a link between the tumor/metastatic-suppressive actions of melatonin and miRNA expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells. We demonstrated that melatonin exerts its anti-tumor actions by reducing proliferation, migration and c-Myc expression of triple negative breast cancer cells. By using Taqman-based assays, we analyzed the expression levels of a set of miRNAs following melatonin treatment of triple negative breast cancer cells and we identified 17 differentially expressed miRNAs, 6 down-regulated and 11 up-regulated. We focused on the anti-metastatic miR-148b and the oncogenic miR-210 both up-regulated by melatonin treatment and studied the effect of their modulation on melatonin-mediated impairment of tumor progression. Surprisingly, when miR-148b or miR-210 were depleted in triple-negative breast cancer cells, using a specific miR-148b sponge or anti-miR-210, melatonin effects on migration inhibition and c-myc downregulation were still visible suggesting that the increase of miR-148b and miR-210 expression observed following melatonin treatment was not required for the efficacy of melatonin action. Nevertheless, ours results suggest that melatonin exhibit a compound for metastatic trait inhibition, especially in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells even if a direct link between modulation of expression of certain proteins or miRNAs and melatonin effects has still to be established."

https://openalex.org/W3003562596,"Upon activation with pathogen-associated molecular patterns, metabolism of macrophages and dendritic cells is shifted from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis, which is considered important for proinflammatory cytokine production. Fragments of bacterial peptidoglycan (muramyl peptides) activate innate immune cells through nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) 1 and/or NOD2 receptors. Here, we show that NOD1 and NOD2 agonists induce early glycolytic reprogramming of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), which is similar to that induced by the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist lipopolysaccharide. This glycolytic reprogramming depends on Akt kinases, independent of mTOR complex 1 and is efficiently inhibited by 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) or by glucose starvation. 2-DG inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production by MDM and monocyte-derived dendritic cells activated by NOD1 or TLR4 agonists, except for tumor necrosis factor production by MDM, which is inhibited initially, but augmented 4 h after addition of agonists and later. However, 2-DG exerts these effects by inducing unfolded protein response rather than by inhibiting glycolysis. By contrast, glucose starvation does not cause unfolded protein response and, in normoxic conditions, only marginally affects proinflammatory cytokine production triggered through NOD1 or TLR4. In hypoxia mimicked by treating MDM with oligomycin (a mitochondrial ATP synthase inhibitor), both 2-DG and glucose starvation strongly suppress tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6 production and compromise cell viability. In summary, the requirement of glycolytic reprogramming for proinflammatory cytokine production in normoxia is not obvious, and effects of 2-DG on cytokine responses should be interpreted cautiously. In hypoxia, however, glycolysis becomes critical for cytokine production and cell survival."

In the present study, using mammalian cell cultures and a PD mouse model, along with CD spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, immunofluorescence-based imaging, and various biochemical assays, we demonstrate that after heat-induced protein aggregation, OTUB1 reacts strongly with both anti-A11 and anti-osteocalcin antibodies, detecting oligomeric, prefibrillar structures or fibrillar species of amyloidogenic proteins, respectively. Further, recombinant OTUB1 exhibited high thioflavin-T and Congo red binding and increased β-sheet formation upon heat induction. The oligomeric OTUB1 aggregates were highly cytotoxic, characteristic of many amyloid proteins. OTUB1 formed inclusions in neuronal cells and co-localized with thioflavin S and with α-synuclein during rotenone-induced stress.

Interestingly, OTUB1 aggregates were also associated with severe cytoskeleton damage, rapid internalization inside the neuronal cells, and mitochondrial damage, all of which contribute to neurotoxicity.

It also unexpectedly plays a noncatalytic role in inhibiting the accumulation of Lys-63 polyubiquitin chain in the DNA double-strand damage response (31Nakada S. Tai I. Panier S. Al-Hakim A.

The inhibition of Lys-63 ubiquitin chain formation is due to the inhibition of the activity of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc13 (UBE2N) through tight binding with the N terminus of OTUB1. The deubiquitinating activity of OTUB1 is not essential for the inhibition of the ubiquitin-conjugating activity of Ubc13 (32Pasupala N. Morrow M.E. Que L.T. Malynn B.A. Ma A. Wolberger C. OTUB1 non-catalytically stabilizes the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2E1 by preventing its autoubiquitination.J. Biol.

Recent studies have also demonstrated that OTUB1 is an anti-apoptotic agent and it attenuates the apoptosis of neuronal cells after intracerebral hemorrhage (33Xie L. Li A. Shen J. Cao M. Ning X. Yuan D. Ji Y. Wang H. Ke K. OTUB1 attenuates neuronal apoptosis after intracerebral hemorrhage.Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2016; 422 (27629786): 171-18010.1007/s11010-016-2817-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The silencing of OTUB1 inhibits the migration of human glioma cells in vitro (34Xu L. Li J.

Silencing of OTUB1 inhibits migration of human glioma cells in vitro.Neuropathology. 2017; 37 (28139865): 217-22610.1111/neup.12366Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Moreover, OTUB1 also directly controls the accumulation of Tau and phosphorylated Tau (AT8 Tau) by regulating Lys-48–linked Tau deubiquitination (35Wang P. Joberty G. Buist A. Vanoosthuyse A. Stancu I.C. Vasconcelos B. Pierrot N. Faelth-Savitski M. Kienlen-Campard P. Octave J.N. Bantscheff M. Drewes G. Moechars D. Dewachter I.

OTUB1 has been reported in the regulation of lung cancer development, ovarian cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma metastasis, colorectal cancer, and many other malignant tumors. However, its high expression in the brain has suggested that it must have a vital role in neuronal functions. On the other hand, its presence in LB, Alzheimer's plaque, and Tau pathology also provides strong evidence that OTUB1 might be a key player in neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we have demonstrated that OTUB1 is an amyloidogenic protein, which forms ordered aggregates with a β-sheet–rich structure in vitro. The oligomeric and fibril forms of OTUB1 cause cytotoxicity due to cytoskeleton disruption, pore formation in the cell membrane, internalization of oligomeric and fibrillar aggregates, the abrupt increment of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and damage to mitochondria. The oligomeric and fibril forms of OTUB1 also induce the expression of α-synuclein and its pathological form pS129-α-synuclein in vitro and co-localize with pS129-α-synuclein in vitro and in a PD mouse model. In summary, our data unambiguously demonstrate that the amyloid characteristic of OTUB1 might regulate the complex PD pathology. Earlier reported MS data of LB were reanalyzed, and our analysis yielded 52 proteins that showed significant differential expression in Lewy bodies of PD compared with control. The aggregation propensity of these 52 proteins was analyzed in the Prediction of Amyloid STructure Aggregation 2.0 (PASTA 2.0) online server (36Walsh I. Seno F. Tosatto S.C. Trovato A. PASTA 2.0: an improved server for protein aggregation prediction.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24848016): W301-W30710.1093/nar/gku399Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). PASTA 2.0 provides secondary structural information as well as energy value in the genome scale. PASTA 2.0 energy function evaluates cross-β pairing between amino acid sequence stretches. We plotted PASTA 2.0 energy values with the relative abundance of proteins in LB compared with control. Correlation plot analysis identified 27 proteins with a PASTA 2.0 score >−9.0, and many of them were reported earlier as amyloidogenic proteins, as listed in Table S1. In a correlation plot, each blue dot represents the protein that was prone to aggregate or was amyloidogenic in nature, and a blue dot above the red line represents more amyloidogenicity of the protein. The red line represents a fitting of the correlation plot. The proteins with high PASTA 2.0 energy exhibited a greater amyloidogenic property, and proteins with low PASTA 2.0 energy showed a lesser amyloidogenic property (Fig. 1A). The PASTA 2.0 energy values for OTUB1 and α-synuclein were −8.0 and −7.0, respectively (Table S1). Interestingly, OTUB1 is also shown to enrich with α-synuclein in the LBs (12Xia Q. Liao L. Cheng D. Duong D.M. Gearing M. Lah J.J. Levey A.I. Peng J. Proteomic identification of novel proteins associated with Lewy bodies.Front. Biosci. 2008; 13 (18508479): 3850-385610.2741/2973Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Composition analysis of micron-scale protein deposits in the AD patient and mouse model also demonstrated that OTUB1 is enriched in AD plaque (13Hadley K.C. Rakhit R. Guo H. Sun Y. Jonkman J.E. McLaurin J. Hazrati L.N. Emili A. Chakrabartty A. Determining composition of micron-scale protein deposits in neurodegenerative disease by spatially targeted optical microproteomics.Elife. 2015; 4 (26418743): e0957910.7554/eLife.09579Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We next checked the amyloidogenic propensity within the OTUB1 sequence using Aggrescan (37Conchillo-Solé O. de Groot N.S. Avilés F.X. Vendrell J. Daura X. Ventura S. AGGRESCAN: a server for the prediction and evaluation of “hot spots” of aggregation in polypeptides.BMC Bioinformatics. 2007; 8 (17324296): 6510.1186/1471-2105-8-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) and Tango (38Fernandez-Escamilla A.M. Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J. Serrano L. Prediction of sequence-dependent and mutational effects on the aggregation of peptides and proteins.Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22 (15361882): 1302-130610.1038/nbt1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Both Aggrescan and Tango analysis predicted that OTUB1 harbors amino acid stretches 169–181 and 158–184, respectively, with the highest β aggregation propensity (Fig. 1, B and C). We used α-synuclein as a positive control for both Aggrescan and Tango analysis. Aggrescan and Tango analysis predicted the stretches of amino acids from 36–42 and 62–79, respectively, of α-synuclein with the highest β aggregation propensity (Fig. 1, D and E). Both of these stretches lie in the N-terminal and NAC domain of α-synuclein, and they play a crucial role in α-synuclein aggregation (39Rodríguez E.E. Arcos-López T. Trujano-Ortiz L.G. Fernández C.O.

Our in silico analysis provided an indication of the amyloidogenic behaviors of OTUB1. Next, we tested the amyloidogenic potential of OTUB1 with purified recombinant protein. OTUB1 purification was performed by a standard GST purification protocol followed by gel filtration. The quality of the protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gel filtration chromatogram and SDS-PAGE image are shown in Fig. S1 (A and B). Thermal stability of OTUB1 was estimated in the thermal melting experiment in CD spectroscopy, and it was found to be 47 °C (Fig. 2A). We also performed a dot blot assay with anti-A11, anti-OC, and anti-OTUB1 antibody after incubation of OTUB1 (350 μm) at 37 °C for 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. We used 10 μl of heat-induced aggregates of OTUB1 aliquot at each time point for anti-A11 and anti-OC reactivity assays and 1 μl of an OTUB1 aliquot at each time point for anti-OTUB1 reactivity in a dot blot assay. The anti-A11 antibody specifically reacts with the oligomeric structure or prefibrillar structure of amyloidogenic protein, whereas the anti-OC antibody specifically reacts with fibrillar species of amyloidogenic protein. Reactivity of A11 and OC antibody was normalized to the total OTUB1. Interestingly, the anti-A11 antibody showed strong reactivity at the initial time points, which are 1-, 2-, 4-, and 6-h. Among them, A11 reactivity is maximum at 6 h time point. However, the anti-OC antibody reactivity started from 1 h, and its signal was increased with the time of incubation (Fig. 2, B and C). The reactivity against anti-A11 and anti-OC antibody demonstrated that OTUB1 produced amyloid aggregates in heat-induced conditions. Proteins that have a tendency to aggregate also expose the hydrophobic surface in heat-induced conditions (41Münch C. Bertolotti A. Exposure of hydrophobic surfaces initiates aggregation of diverse ALS-causing superoxide dismutase-1 mutants.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 399 (20399791): 512-52510.1016/j.jmb.2010.04.019Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic surface exposure was measured by an 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid (ANS)-binding assay. Incubation of OTUB1 with ANS at 37 °C showed an increase in fluorescence intensity with time (Fig. 2D). The concentration-dependent ANS binding was observed in the case of OTUB1, and it was evident from the rate of binding analysis. Thioflavin T (ThT) is a dye that binds with the amyloid proteins and shows an increase in ThT fluorescence (42Xue C. Lin T.Y. Chang D. Guo Z. Thioflavin T as an amyloid dye: fibril quantification, optimal concentration and effect on aggregation.R. Soc. Open Sci. 2017; 4 (28280572): 16069610.1098/rsos.160696Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Here, we observed that OTUB1 strongly bound with ThT dye in heat-induced conditions. The normalized ThT fluorescence intensity at different concentrations of OTUB1 showed an increased ThT fluorescence intensity with the progression of time at 37 °C (Fig. 2E). Both ANS- and ThT-binding kinetic parameters at different OTUB1 concentrations are given in Table S2. Congo red (CR) is a histologic dye that binds to amyloid proteins because of their extensive cross-β-sheet structures and produces apple yellow-green color birefringence in cross-polarized light (43Wu C. Scott J. Shea J.E. Binding of Congo red to amyloid protofibrils of the Alzheimer Aβ(9–40) peptide probed by molecular dynamics simulations.Biophys.

The mature amyloid-like structure of OTUB1 was confirmed by CR-binding assays. OTUB1 fibril-bound CR showed an apple yellow-green color birefringence under cross-polarized light (Fig. 2F). Far-UV CD spectropolarimetry was used to find the secondary structure component analysis of OTUB1. Dichroweb analysis (44Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. DICHROWEB, an online server for protein secondary structure analyses from circular dichroism spectroscopic data.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32 (15215473): W668-W67310.1093/nar/gkh371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1847) Google Scholar) of the CD spectra of OTUB1 confirmed 39 ± 5% α-helix, 17 ± 3% β-sheet, and a 20 ± 0% turn in solution as indicated in Table S3. The secondary structural information obtained from CD analysis was very much consistent with the crystallographic information with α-helix 44%, β-sheet 24%, and turn 28% (45Ernst A. Avvakumov G. Tong J. Fan Y. Zhao Y. Alberts P. Persaud A. Walker J.R. Neculai A.M. Neculai D. Vorobyov A. Garg P. Beatty L. Chan P.K. Juang Y.C. et al.A strategy for modulation of enzymes in the ubiquitin system.Science. 2013; 339 (23287719): 590-59510.1126/science.1230161Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The time-dependent molar ellipticity change of OTUB1 at 37 °C was also monitored. At 0 h of incubation, OTUB1 showed two minima, one at 208 nm and the other at 222 nm (Fig. S2). The molar ellipticity ratio of 218 nm/208 nm (β-sheet) was slowly increased, and the 208/218 nm (α-helix) ratio was decreased upon incubation of OTUB1 at 37 °C with the progression of time (Fig. 2G). Collectively, the ThT binding assay, the CR-binding assay, and secondary structural analysis have confirmed that OTUB1 undergoes amyloid-like conformation in heat-induced conditions. The oligomerization of OTUB1 upon heat-induced conditions was monitored in a dynamic light-scattering experiment. We found that the hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of the OTUB1 monomer at 0 h of incubation was 8 ± 0.6 nm, and with time, the hydrodynamic radius of OTUB1 species was shifted to a higher-size particle, as indicated in Fig. 3A. The hydrodynamic radius of different species at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h were 1.42 ± 0.06 × 103, 1.79 ± 0.14 × 103, 1.83 ± 0.12 × 103, 1.99 ± 0.35 × 103, and 2.24 ± 0.43 × 103, respectively. The OTUB1 monomer-to-oligomer transition was completed within a 6-h incubation, which prompted us to perform the dynamic light scattering (DLS) study with a short time interval. Protein was incubated at 0 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 2 h, 4 h, and 6 h, and oligomeric intermediates were monitored in DLS at 37 °C. We found 4.73 ± 0.52 × 102-nm species as a major oligomer upon 30 min of incubation. The hydrodynamic radius of major species gradually increased in size with the time of incubation (Fig. S3A). The morphology of heat-induced aggregates of OTUB1 at 0, 6, 12, 48, and 72 h was visualized in the atomic force microscopy. It did not show any characteristic aggregate at 0 h. However, we observed specific ordered oligomeric aggregates at 6 h. Longer incubation induced fibrillar morphology, as evident in the atomic force microscope (AFM) images at 12, 48, and 72 h (Fig. 3B). The crater-like OTUB"

The findings should contribute to the field of health promotion programs for wheelchair users. Methods Five focus groups were held with wheelchair users (n = 25), and two with rehabilitation professionals (n = 11). A thematic approach was used for data analysis in which the determinants were categorized using an integrated International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health and Attitude, Social influence and self-Efficacy model. Results Reported personal factors influencing dietary behaviour in wheelchair users were knowledge, boredom, fatigue, stage of life, habits, appetite, self-control, multiple lifestyle problems, intrinsic motivation, goal setting, monitoring, risk perception, positive experiences, suffering, action planning, health condition, function impairments, attitude and self-efficacy. Reported environmental factors influencing dietary behaviour in wheelchair users were unadjusted kitchens, monitoring difficulties, eating out, costs, unfavourable food supply, nutrition education/counselling, access to simple healthy recipes, eating together, cooking for others, and awareness and support of family and friends. Conclusions Important modifiable determinants of dietary behaviour in wheelchair users that might be influenced in lifestyle interventions are knowledge, fatigue, habits, self-control, intrinsic motivation, risk perception, attitude and self-efficacy. It is recommended to involve relatives, since they appear to significantly influence dietary behaviour."

Patients in the INTEGRATE Intervention Group were 1:1 matched to controls selected from provincial healthcare administrative data using propensity score-matching. The use of palliative care, community-based care services (home care, physician home visit, and outpatient opioid use) and acute care (emergency department, hospitalization) was each evaluated within one year after the date of identification. The hazard ratio (HR) in the Intervention Group was calculated for each outcome.Of the 1,185 patients in the Intervention Group, 951 (80.3%) used palliative care services during follow-up, compared to 739 (62.4%) among 1,185 patients in the Control Group [HR of 1.69 (95% CI 1.56 to 1.82)]. The Intervention Group also had higher proportions of patients who used home care [81.4% vs. 55.2%; HR 2.07 (95% CI 1.89 to 2.27)], had physician home visits [35.5% vs. 23.7%; HR 1.63 (95% CI 1.46 to 1.92)] or had increased outpatient opioid use [64.3% vs. 52.1%); HR 1.43 (95% CI 1.30 to 1.57]. The Intervention Group was also more likely to have a hospitalization that was not primarily focused on palliative care (1.42 (95% CI 1.28 to 1.58)) and an unplanned emergency department visit for non-palliative care purpose (1.47 (95% CI 1.32 to 1.64)).Physicians actively identifying patients who would benefit from palliative care resulted in increased use of palliative and community-based care services, but also increased use of acute care services."

https://openalex.org/W3004924406,"The Australian National Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) provides biennial immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) screening for people aged 50-74 years. Previous work has quantified the number of colorectal cancer (CRC) deaths prevented by the NBCSP and has shown that it is cost-effective. With a 40% screening participation rate, the NBCSP is currently underutilised and could be improved by increasing program participation, but the maximum appropriate level of spending on effective interventions to increase adherence has not yet been quantified.To estimate (i) reductions in CRC cases and deaths for 2020-2040 attributable to, and (ii) the threshold for cost-effective investment (TCEI) in, effective future interventions to improve participation in the NBCSP.A comprehensive microsimulation model, Policy1-Bowel, was used to simulate CRC natural history and screening in Australia, considering currently reported NBCSP adherence rates, i.e. iFOBT participation (∼40%) and diagnostic colonoscopy assessment rates (∼70%). Australian residents aged 40-74 were modelled. We evaluated three scenarios: (1) diagnostic colonoscopy assessment increasing to 90%; (2) iFOBT screening participation increasing to 60% by 2020, 70% by 2030 with diagnostic assessment rates of 90%; and (3) iFOBT screening increasing to 90% by 2020 with diagnostic assessment rates of 90%. In each scenario, we estimated CRC incidence and mortality, colonoscopies, costs, and TCEI given indicative willingness-to-pay thresholds of AUD$10,000-$30,000/LYS.By 2040, age-standardised CRC incidence and mortality rates could be reduced from 46.2 and 13.5 per 100,000 persons, respectively, if current participation rates continued, to (1) 44.0 and 12.7, (2) 36.8 and 8.8, and (3) 31.9 and 6.5. In Scenario 2, 23,000 lives would be saved from 2020-2040 vs current participation rates. The estimated scenario-specific TCEI (Australian dollars or AUD$/year) to invest in interventions to increase participation, given a conservative willingness-to-pay threshold of AUD$10,000/LYS, was (1) AUD$14.9M, (2) AUD$72.0M, and (3) AUD$76.5M.Significant investment in evidence-based interventions could be used to improve NBCSP adherence and help realise the program's potential. Such interventions might include mass media campaigns to increase program participation, educational or awareness interventions for practitioners, and/or interventions resulting in improvements in referral pathways. Any set of interventions which achieves at least 70% iFOBT screening participation and a 90% diagnostic assessment rate while costing under AUD$72 million annually would be highly cost-effective (<AUD$10,000/LYS) and save 23,000 additional lives from 2020-2040."
https://openalex.org/W3005261412,"Background On-line hemodiafiltration (HDF) clears more azotemic toxins compared to high-flux hemodialysis (HD). The response to vaccination is impaired in dialysis patients. We wished to determine whether the immune responses to influenza vaccine in dialysis patients treated by HDF were stronger than those treated by HD. Materials and methods We conducted a prospective cohort study in chronic dialysis patients during the 2016 and 2017 influenza seasons. All participants received a single standard dose of trivalent influenza vaccine, and we studied the elicited humoral immune response by hemagglutination inhibition test, and cell-mediated immune response by enumeration of lymphocyte cellular markers and proliferation assays. Results We immunized 60 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients: 42 (70%) treated with HD and 18 patients (30%) with HDF. The median (interquartile range) age was 65.0 (55.0–74.5) years. All patients developed seroprotection to at least one influenza vaccine strain at one month post-vaccination, and did not differ between groups. By logistic regression, age was the only factor independently associated with seroconversion to all vaccine strains (odds ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.80–0.98; p = 0.022). Seroprotection to all vaccine strains was sustained for longer in patients treated with HDF, and the results remained the same after age adjustment. For cellular immune response, patients who seroconverted to all vaccine strains had higher CD38+ T cell subpopulations pre-vaccination. Patients treated by HDF had higher lymphocyte proliferation to circulating influenza A strains. Conclusions Seroconversion to all influenza vaccine strains was associated with age. Patients treated with HDF demonstrated seroprotection was sustained for longer compared to those treated by HD and greater lymphocyte proliferation to circulating influenza A strains. These encouraging results for HDF require confirmation in a larger dialysis population. Trial registration ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT04122222."
https://openalex.org/W3003268053,"Concerns on the timing and processes associated with petroleum degradation were raised after the use of Corexit during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. There is a lack of understanding of the removal of oil associated with flocculate materials to the sediment. Mesocosm studies employing coastal and open-ocean seawater from the Gulf of Mexico were undertaken to examine changes in oil concentration and composition with time. The water accommodated fractions (WAF) and chemically enhanced WAF (CEWAF) produced using Macondo surrogate oil and Corexit were followed over 3-4 days in controlled environmental conditions. Environmental half-lives of estimated oil equivalents (EOE), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), n-alkanes (C10-C35), isoprenoids pristane and phytane, and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) were determined. EOE and PAH concentrations decreased exponentially following first-order decay rate kinetics. WAF, CEWAF and DCEWAF (a 10X CEWAF dilution) treatments half-lives ranged from 0.9 to 3.2 days for EOE and 0.5 to 3.3 days for PAH, agreeing with estimates from previous mesocosm and field studies. The aliphatic half-lives for CEWAF and DECWAF treatments ranged from 0.8 to 2.0 days, but no half-life for WAF could be calculated as concentrations were below the detection limits. Biodegradation occurred in all treatments based on the temporal decrease of the nC17/pristane and nC18/phytane ratios. The heterogeneity observed in all treatments was likely due to the hydrophobicity of oil and weathering processes occurring at different rates and times. The presence of dispersant did not dramatically change the half-lives of oil. Comparing degradation of oil alone as well as with dispersant present is critical to determine the fate and transport of these materials in the ocean."
https://openalex.org/W3004274389,"Chronic exposure to ambient levels of air pollution induces respiratory illness exacerbation by increasing inflammatory responses and apoptotic cells in pulmonary tissues. The ineffective phagocytosis of these apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) by macrophages has been considered an important factor in these pathological mechanisms. Depending on microenvironmental stimuli, macrophages can assume different phenotypes with different functional actions. M1 macrophages are recognized by their proinflammatory activity, whereas M2 macrophages play pivotal roles in responding to microorganisms and in efferocytosis to avoid the progression of inflammatory conditions. To verify how exposure to air pollutants interferes with macrophage polarization in emphysema development, we evaluated the different macrophage phenotypes in a PPE- induced model with the exposure to diesel exhaust particles. C57BL/6 mice received intranasal instillation of porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) to induce emphysema, and the control groups received saline. Both groups were exposed to diesel exhaust particles or filtered air for 60 days according to the groups. We observed that both the diesel and PPE groups had an increase in alveolar enlargement, collagen and elastic fibers in the parenchyma and the number of macrophages, lymphocytes and epithelial cells in BAL, and these responses were exacerbated in animals that received PPE instillation prior to exposure to diesel exhaust particles. The same response pattern was found inCaspase-3 positive cell analysis, attesting to an increase in cell apoptosis, which is in agreement with the increase in M2 phenotype markers, measured by RT-PCR and flow cytometry analysis. We did not verify differences among the groups for the M1 phenotype. In conclusion, our results showed that both chronic exposure to diesel exhaust particles and PPE instillation induced inflammatory conditions, cell apoptosis and emphysema development, as well as an increase in M2 phenotype macrophages, and the combination of these two factors exacerbated these responses. The predominance of the M2-like phenotype likely occurred due to the increased demand for efferocytosis. However, M2 macrophage activity was ineffective, resulting in emphysema development and worsening of symptoms."

In this study, the fracture behavior of sandwich honeycomb composite (SHC) beams containing crack at the skin was investigated experimentally and numerically under four-point loading. Three different arrangements of unidirectional (UD) carbon fiber composite and the triaxially woven (TW) fabric were considered for the skins. The presence of a 10 mm crack at mid-span of the top skin, mid-span of the bottom skin, and mid-way between load and support of the top skin, respectively, were considered. Failure load equations of the load initiating the skin crack extension were analytically derived and then numerically developed using the J-integral approach. The crack extension failure mode dominated all cracked specimens except those with low-stiffness skin which were controlled by the compressive skin debonding and core shear failures."
https://openalex.org/W3003281968,"Abstract Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a dynamic process that drives cancer cell plasticity and is thought to play a major role in metastasis. Here we show, using MDA-MB-231 cells as a model, that the plasticity of at least some metastatic breast cancer cells is dependent on the transcriptional co-regulator CBFβ. We demonstrate that CBFβ is essential to maintain the mesenchymal phenotype of triple-negative breast cancer cells and that CBFβ-depleted cells undergo a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) and re-organise into acini-like structures, reminiscent of those formed by epithelial breast cells. We subsequently show, using an inducible CBFβ system, that the MET can be reversed, thus demonstrating the plasticity of CBFβ-mediated EMT. Moreover, the MET can be reversed by expression of the EMT transcription factor Slug whose expression is dependent on CBFβ. Finally, we demonstrate that loss of CBFβ inhibits the ability of metastatic breast cancer cells to invade bone cell cultures and suppresses their ability to form bone metastases in vivo. Together our findings demonstrate that CBFβ can determine the plasticity of the metastatic cancer cell phenotype, suggesting that its regulation in different micro-environments may play a key role in the establishment of metastatic tumours."
https://openalex.org/W3004273640,"The actin cytoskeleton is a dynamic array of filaments that undergoes rapid remodeling to drive many cellular processes. An essential feature of filament remodeling is the spatio-temporal regulation of actin filament nucleation. One family of actin filament nucleators, the Diaphanous-related formins, is activated by the binding of small G-proteins such as RhoA. However, RhoA only partially activates formins, suggesting that additional factors are required to fully activate the formin. Here we identify one such factor, IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein-1 (IQGAP1), which enhances RhoA-mediated activation of the Diaphanous-related formin (DIAPH1) and targets DIAPH1 to the plasma membrane. We find that the inhibitory intramolecular interaction within DIAPH1 is disrupted by the sequential binding of RhoA and IQGAP1. Binding of RhoA and IQGAP1 robustly stimulates DIAPH1-mediated actin filament nucleation in vitro In contrast, the actin capping protein Flightless-I, in conjunction with RhoA, only weakly stimulates DIAPH1 activity. IQGAP1, but not Flightless-I, is required to recruit DIAPH1 to the plasma membrane where actin filaments are generated. These results indicate that IQGAP1 enhances RhoA-mediated activation of DIAPH1 in vivo Collectively these data support a model where the combined action of RhoA and an enhancer ensures the spatio-temporal regulation of actin nucleation to stimulate robust and localized actin filament production in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3004623335,"Staphylococcus epidermidis has emerged as the leading agent causing neonatal late-onset sepsis in preterm neonates; although the severity of the episodes caused by this species is often underestimated, it might exert relevant short- and long-term detrimental effects on neonatal outcomes. In this context, the objective of this study was to characterize a collection of S. epidermidis strains obtained from meconium and feces of preterm infants, and to assess the potential role of the enteral feeding tubes as potential reservoirs for this microorganism. A total of 26 preterm infants were enrolled in the study. Meconium and fecal samples were collected weekly during their first month of life (n = 92). Feeding samples were collected after their pass through the enteral feeding tubes (n = 84). S. epidermidis was present in the fecal samples of all the infants in, at least, one sampling time at concentrations ranging from 6.5 to 7.8 log10 CFU/g. Initially, 344 isolates were obtained and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiling allowed the reduction of the collection to 101 strains. Among them, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) profiling showed the presence of 32 different sequence types (ST). Globally, most of the STs to hospital-adapted high-risk clones and belonged to clonal complexes (CC) associated to the hospital environment, such as CC2. The virulence gene most commonly detected among the strains was altE. High resistance rates to macrolides and aminoglycosides were detected and 64% of the strains harboured the mecA gene, which was codified in SCCmec types. Our results indicates the existence of a complex and genetically diverse S. epidermidis population in the NICU environment. A better knowledge of S. epidermidis strains may help to devise strategies to avoid their conversion from symbiont to pathobiont microorganisms in the NICUs."
https://openalex.org/W3004048883,"Globular protein sequences encode not only functional structures (the native state) but also protein foldability, i.e. a conformational search that is both efficient and robustly minimizes misfolding. Studies of mutations associated with toxic misfolding have yielded insights into molecular determinants of protein foldability. Of particular interest are residues that are conserved yet dispensable in the native state. Here, we exploited the mutant proinsulin syndrome (a major cause of permanent neonatal-onset diabetes mellitus) to investigate whether toxic misfolding poses an evolutionary constraint. Our experiments focused on an invariant aromatic motif (PheB24–PheB25–TyrB26) with complementary roles in native self-assembly and receptor binding. A novel class of mutations provided evidence that insulin can bind to the insulin receptor (IR) in two different modes, distinguished by a “register shift” in this motif, as visualized by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Register-shift variants are active but defective in cellular foldability and exquisitely susceptible to fibrillation in vitro. Indeed, expression of the corresponding proinsulin variant induced endoplasmic reticulum stress, a general feature of the mutant proinsulin syndrome. Although not present among vertebrate insulin and insulin-like sequences, a prototypical variant ([GlyB24]insulin) was as potent as WT insulin in a rat model of diabetes. Although in MD simulations the shifted register of receptor engagement is compatible with the structure and allosteric reorganization of the IR-signaling complex, our results suggest that this binding mode is associated with toxic misfolding and so is disallowed in evolution.

The variant proinsulin must therefore contain an unpaired cysteine, in principle mediating aberrant disulfide interchange and inter-molecular disulfide bridges (31Liu M. Li Y. Cavener D. Arvan P.

Whereas patients with Cys-related mutations invariably present with neonatal DM, nonCys-related mutations are associated with ages of onset ranging from neonatal to the 3rd decade of life; furthermore, the latter pedigrees typically exhibit incomplete penetrance (34Liu M.

Animals 15 client-owned dogs of different breeds and additionally 1 research beagle dog cadaver. Procedures In the retrospective study part, 15 dogs who underwent multiple consecutive MR imaging examinations with intravenous injection of linear GBCA gadodiamide were analyzed. SI ratio differences on unenhanced T1-weighted MR images before and after gadodiamide injections was calculated by subtracting SI ratios between DCN and pons of the first examination from the ratio of the last examination. Additionally, 1 research beagle dog cadaver was used for LA-ICP-MS (Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) analysis of gadolinium in the cerebellum as an add-on to another animal study. Descriptive and non-parametrical statistical analysis was performed and a p-value of < 0.05 was considered significant. Results No statistically significant differences of SI ratios, between DCN and pons, were detectable based on unenhanced T1-weighted MR images. LA-ICP-MS analyses showed between 1.5 to 2.5 μg gadolinium/g tissue in the cerebellum of the examined dog, 35 months after the last of 3 MRI examination with gadodiamide (two examinations at a dose of 1 x 0.1mmol/kg, last examination at a dose of 3 x 0.05mmol/kg). Conclusion and clinical relevance Although the retrospective MRI study did not indicate any visible effect of SI increase after multiple gadodiamide exposures, further studies based on LA-ICP-MS showed that the optical threshold was not reached for a potential visible effect. Gadolinium was detectable at a level of 1.5 to 2.5 μg gadolinium/g tissue by using LA-ICP-MS in the cerebellum 35 months after last MRI examination. The general importance of gadolinium retention of subvisible contents requires further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3003603020,"Cellular senescence is terminal cell cycle arrest that represents a prominent response to numerous anticancer therapies. The oncogene inhibitor of the apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 (iASPP) plays essential roles in regulating cellular drug response by inhibiting apoptosis. However, whether or not it regulates chemotherapy-induced senescence (TIS) in cancer cells remains unclear. Here, using two commonly used cancer cell lines, HCT 116 and MCF-7, along with the xenograft mouse model, we found that iASPP inhibits senescence and also influences the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which confers anticancer drug resistance independently of apoptosis. Mechanistically, iASPP is transcriptionally elevated by the p65 subunit of NF-κB in senescent cells and then translocates to the nucleus, where it binds p53 and NF-κBp65. This binding inhibits their transcriptional activities toward p21 and the key SASP factors interleukin (IL)-6/IL-8, respectively, and subsequently prevents senescence. Of note, we observed that iASPP knockdown sensitizes apoptosis-resistant cancers to doxorubicin treatment by promoting senescence both in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that iASPP integrates the NF-κBp65- and p53-signaling pathways and thereby regulates cell fate in response to TIS, leading to chemotherapy resistance. These findings suggest that iASPP inhibition might be a strategy that could help restore senescence in cancer cells and improve outcomes of chemotherapy-based therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3004118377,"Objective The main objective of this study was to evidence the potential impact of the intensity, duration and recurrence of depression on the development of arterial stiffness (AS) leading to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and diastolic dysfunction (DD) in patients with new onset depression (NOD) and recurrent depression (RD) in comparison to 33 control subjects without depression. Another aim was to identify potential predictive factors regarding the occurrence of diastolic dysfunction (DD). Methods Our study group included 58 patients diagnosed with NOD and 128 diagnosed with RD, without any previously diagnosed significant heart diseases. The intensity of depression was evaluated by means of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Assessment of pulse wave velocity (PWV), left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and echocardiographic parameters characterizing DD were performed for each patient. Results The cardiology evaluations suggested an increased prevalence of AS in all patients, of significantly higher rate than in controls (p<0.001), which was statistically correlated with the severity and duration of depression. Another significant finding was an increased prevalence of DD (29.31% and 63.28%, respectively; p<0.001) correlated with the MADRS score, total duration and number of recurrences/relapses. The multivariate logistic regression analysis identified PWV, the intensity and duration of depression as significant predictive factors for the occurrence of DD. Conclusions In our study, diastolic dysfunction was a common finding among patients with RD, but it was also noted, to a lesser extent, in those suffering with NOD. DD was associated with altered AS, and strongly correlated with the intensity and the duration of depressive symptoms. The two latter factors, together with an increased PWV, were strong predictors for the occurrence of DD."
https://openalex.org/W3005029546,"Fish stocks interact through predation and competition for resources, yet stocks are typically managed independently on a stock-by-stock basis. The need to take account of multi-species interactions is widely acknowledged. However, examples of the application of multi-species models to support management decisions are limited as they are often seen as too complex and lacking transparency. Thus there is a need for simple and transparent methods to address stock interactions in a way that supports managers. Here we introduce LeMaRns, a new R-package of a general length-structured fish community model, LeMans, that characterises fishing using fleets that can have different gears and species catch preferences. We describe the model, package implementation, and give three examples of use: determination of multi-species reference points; modelling of mixed-fishery interactions; and examination of the response of community indicators to dynamical changes in fleet effort within a mixed-fishery. LeMaRns offers a diverse array of options for parameterisation. This, along with the speed, comprehensive documentation, and open source nature of the package makes LeMans newly accessible, transparent, and easy to use, which we hope will lead to increased uptake by the fisheries management community."
https://openalex.org/W3005200081,"Autoimmune regulator (AIRE) is a transcriptional regulator that is primarily expressed in medullary epithelial cells, where it induces tissue-specific antigen expression. Under pathological conditions, AIRE expression is induced in epidermal cells and promotes skin tumor development. This study aimed to clarify the role of AIRE in the pathogenesis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). AIRE expression was evaluated in six OSCC cell lines and in OSCC tissue specimens. Expression of STAT1, ICAM1, CXCL10, CXCL11, and MMP9 was elevated in 293A cells stably expressing AIRE, and conversely, was decreased in AIRE-knockout HSC3 OSCC cells when compared to the respective controls. Upregulation of STAT1, and ICAM in OSCC cells was confirmed in tissue specimens by immunohistochemistry. We provide evidence that AIRE exerts transcriptional control in cooperation with ETS1. Expression of STAT1, ICAM1, CXCL10, CXCL11, and MMP9 was increased in 293A cells upon Ets1 transfection, and coexpression of AIRE further increased the expression of these proteins. AIRE coprecipitated with ETS1 in a modified immunoprecipitation assay using formaldehyde crosslinking. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR analysis revealed that promoter fragments of STAT1, ICAM1, CXCL10, and MMP9 were enriched in the AIRE precipitates. These results indicate that AIRE is induced in OSCC and supports cancer-related gene expression in cooperation with ETS1. This is a novel function of AIRE in extrathymic tissues under the pathological condition."

We have determined whether antibody and T cell responses to Mtb membrane (MtM)-associated antigens, especially the latency-induced protein alpha crystallin (Acr), can discriminate between latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and active TB (ATB) disease. Study subjects comprised a previously described cohort of healthcare workers (HCWs, n = 43) and smear-positive ATB patients (n = 10). HCWs were further categorized as occupational contacts (OC, n = 30), household contacts of TB (HC, n = 8) and cured TB (CTB, n = 5). Levels (ΔOD) of serum antibody isotypes (IgG, IgA and IgM) were determined by ELISA and blood T cell proliferative responses were determined by flow cytometry using Ki67 protein as marker for DNA synthesis. Antibodies to MtM and Acr were predominantly IgG and their levels in HCWs and ATB did not differ significantly. However, HCWs showed a significantly higher level of anti-MtM IgM and a significantly lower level of anti-Acr IgA antibodies than the ATB patients. Also, a larger proportion of HCWs showed a high (>1) ΔODAcr/ΔODMtM ratio for IgG. HCWs also showed a higher, though not significantly different from ATB, avidity of anti-MtM (IgG) antibodies. A higher proportion of HCWs (35% of OC, 62.5% of HC and 20% of CTB), compared with ATB (10%) showed a positive T cell response to Acr along with significant difference (P <0.05) between HC and ATB. A significant correlation (r = 0.60, P <0.0001) was noted between T cell responses of HCWs towards Acr and MtM (reported earlier by us) and both responses tended to decline with rising exposure to the infection. Even so, positive responses to Acr (38.5%) were significantly lower than to MtM (92%). Neither antibody nor T cell responses to either antigen appeared affected by BCG vaccination or reactivity to tuberculin. Results of the study suggest that the levels of IgM antibodies to MtM, IgA antibodies to Acr and proliferative T cell responses to both the antigens can potentially discriminate between LTBI and active TB disease. They also underscore the necessity of SOPs for antibody assays."
https://openalex.org/W3003241878,"Nuclear accumulation of the small phosphoprotein integrin cytoplasmic domain–associated protein-1 (ICAP1) results in recruitment of its binding partner, Krev/Rap1 interaction trapped-1 (KRIT1), to the nucleus. KRIT1 loss is the most common cause of cerebral cavernous malformation, a neurovascular dysplasia resulting in dilated, thin-walled vessels that tend to rupture, increasing the risk for hemorrhagic stroke. KRIT1's nuclear roles are unknown, but it is known to function as a scaffolding or adaptor protein at cell-cell junctions and in the cytosol, supporting normal blood vessel integrity and development. As ICAP1 controls KRIT1 subcellular localization, presumably influencing KRIT1 function, in this work, we investigated the signals that regulate ICAP1 and, hence, KRIT1 nuclear localization. ICAP1 contains a nuclear localization signal within an unstructured, N-terminal region that is rich in serine and threonine residues, several of which are reportedly phosphorylated. Using quantitative microscopy, we revealed that phosphorylation-mimicking substitutions at Ser-10, or to a lesser extent at Ser-25, within this N-terminal region inhibit ICAP1 nuclear accumulation. Conversely, phosphorylation-blocking substitutions at these sites enhanced ICAP1 nuclear accumulation. We further demonstrate that p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) can phosphorylate ICAP1 at Ser-10 both in vitro and in cultured cells and that active PAK4 inhibits ICAP1 nuclear accumulation in a Ser-10–dependent manner. Finally, we show that ICAP1 phosphorylation controls nuclear localization of the ICAP1-KRIT1 complex. We conclude that serine phosphorylation within the ICAP1 N-terminal region can prevent nuclear ICAP1 accumulation, providing a mechanism that regulates KRIT1 localization and signaling, potentially influencing vascular development.

We further demonstrate that p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) can phosphorylate ICAP1 at Ser-10 both in vitro and in cultured cells and that active PAK4 inhibits ICAP1 nuclear accumulation in a Ser-10–dependent manner. Finally, we show that ICAP1 phosphorylation controls nuclear localization of the ICAP1-KRIT1 complex. We conclude that serine phosphorylation within the ICAP1 N-terminal region can prevent nuclear ICAP1 accumulation, providing a mechanism that regulates KRIT1 localization and signaling, potentially influencing vascular development."

Here we determined the crystal structure of human VAT-1, a cytosolic soluble protein that was suggested to transfer phosphatidylserine, at 2.2 A resolution. We found that VAT-1 transferred not only phosphatidylserine but also other acidic phospholipids between membranes in vitro Structure-based mutational analyses showed the presence of a possible lipid-binding cavity at the interface between the two subdomains, and two tyrosine residues in the flexible loops facilitated phospholipid transfer, likely by functioning as a gate to this lipid-binding cavity. We also found that a basic and hydrophobic loop with two tryptophan residues protruded from the molecule and facilitated binding to the acidic-lipid membranes, thereby achieving efficient phospholipid transfer."

However, only a few isolates from Japan were included in this analysis. To conduct more precise genotyping of T. gondii, we examined the genotypes of Japanese isolates in this study. DNA sequences of 6 loci were determined in 17 Japanese isolates and compared with those of strains of 16 haplogroups. As a result, Japanese isolates were classified into four groups. We investigated the virulence of some Japanese isolates and found a highly virulent strain in mice, comparable to that of RH strain, although this Japanese isolate was sister to strains of haplogroup 2, which show moderate virulence in mice. We further investigated whether this high virulence isolate had different virulence mechanism and strategy to adapt to Japanese host from other strains by comparing the virulence-related genes, ROP5, 18 and the immunomodulatory gene, ROP16 of the isolate with those of archetypical strains (GT1, ME49 and VEG). This analysis indicated the high virulence of the isolate in mice was partly explained by gene sequences of ROP5 and ROP16. These findings lead to the elucidation of biodiversity of T. gondii and have potential to optimize the diagnostic protocol."

Unlike other bacteria, Clostridium difficile, the major human pathogen responsible for antibiotic-associated diarrhea, has only a single functional sortase (SrtB). Sortase's vital importance in bacterial virulence has been long recognized, and C. difficile sortase B (Cd-SrtB) has become an attractive therapeutic target for managing C. difficile infection. A better understanding of the molecular activity of Cd-SrtB may help spur the development of effective agents against C. difficile infection. In this study, using site-directed mutagenesis, biochemical and biophysical tools, LC-MS/MS, and crystallographic analyses, we identified key residues essential for Cd-SrtB catalysis and substrate recognition. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first evidence that a conserved serine residue near the active site participates in the catalytic activity of Cd-SrtB and also SrtB from Staphylococcus aureus. The serine residue indispensable for SrtB activity may be involved in stabilizing a thioacyl-enzyme intermediate because it is neither a nucleophilic residue nor a substrate-interacting residue, based on the LC-MS/MS data and available structural models of SrtB–substrate complexes. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that residues 163–168 located on the β6/β7 loop of Cd-SrtB dominate specific recognition of the peptide substrate PPKTG.

CDI is transmitted through bacterial spores or from person to person by the fecal–oral route. Patients infected with C. difficile spores are mostly by direct contact with contaminated surfaces and symptomatic patients in the hospital setting (9Dubberke E.R. Gerding D.N. Classen D. Arias K.M.

Furthermore, alternative treatment options are considered, such as fecal microbiota transplantation as a means of re-establishing a normal microbiota profile for patients with recurrent CDI (12Surawicz C.M.

Nevertheless, fecal microbiota transplantation is still not widely applied, and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy remains the first choice in managing CDI (6Leffler D.A. Lamont J.T.

However, antibiotic use is a major risk factor for recurrent CDI and C. difficile superinfection (5Johnson S. Recurrent Clostridium difficile infection: a review of risk factors, treatments, and outcomes.J.

The incidence rate of multiple recurrent CDI and frequency of antimicrobial treatment failures have significantly increased (13Ma G.K. Brensinger C.M. Wu Q. Lewis J.D.

Med. 2017; 167 (28672282): 152-15810.7326/M16-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Moreover, C. difficile 630 is a multidrug-resistant strain whose genome was isolated from a patient with pseudomembranous colitis (14Sebaihia M. Wren B.W. Mullany P. Fairweather N.F. Minton N.

Given that the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is rising, nonconventional antimicrobial therapies are in demand, and efforts searching for developing alternative anti-infective drugs for the treatment of CDI patients are growing (15Roshan N. Hammer K.A. Riley T.V. Non-conventional antimicrobial and alternative therapies for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection.Anaerobe. 2018; 49 (29309845): 103-11110.1016/j.anaerobe.2018.01.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).

All the characterized sortases possess a signal sequence that enables their translocation across the membrane via the Sec apparatus and target proteins consisting of a cell wall sorting signal in the C-terminal region (23Jacobitz A.W.

The characteristic five-residue sortase-recognition sequence motif located within cell wall sorting signal of substrate proteins is class- and/or bacteria-specific. Class A sortase enzymes anchor many surface proteins in cell wall and play a housekeeping role. Sortase A from Staphylococcus aureus (Sa-SrtA), the best studied sortase, recognizes the LPXTG motif of its substrates and initiates catalysis by employing the thiolate of the active site cysteine residue to cleave the peptide bond between Thr and Gly residues (25Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Proteolytic cleavage and cell wall anchoring at the LPXTG motif of surface proteins in Gram-positive bacteria.Mol.

This process results in generation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate by a thioester linkage between the cysteine residue of sortase and its substrate (26Marraffini L.A. Dedent A.C. Schneewind O. Sortases and the art of anchoring proteins to the envelopes of Gram-positive bacteria.Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Subsequently, a secondary substrate (lipid II or pilin) is recognized by sortase that catalyzes a reaction in which the amine group from lipid II or a lysine residue within a pilin subunit nucleophilic attacks the thioacyl bond and relieves the sortase-protein thioacyl intermediate (23Jacobitz A.W.

In contrast to many other bacteria that typically have multiple sortases, C. difficile possesses only sortase B (Cd-SrtB), which attaches seven proteins to cell wall and appears to play a general role (28Donahue E.H.

The binding grooves are primarily formed by strands β4 and β7 and loops connecting β2/β3, β3/β4, β6/β7, and β7/β8. The β6/β7 loop plays a substantial role in interacting and discriminating sorting motif because studies showed that the replacement of the β6/β7 loop in Sa-SrtA with the corresponding site from Sa-SrtB results in converting the specificity profile of Sa-SrtA to Sa-SrtB (33Jacobitz A.W.

Our previous work has defined two residues located within β6/β7 loop of Cd-SrtB, Ser163 and Tyr167, that are to be in the direct contact with the substrate peptide PPKTG (40Yin J.C. Fei C.H. Lo Y.C.

It draws our attention whether the less dissimilar β6/β7 loop in class B sortase also acts as a determinant for bacteria-specific sorting signal recognition. Significant efforts have been made to seek the novel therapeutics for CDI, and sortase is one of the most considered targets (28Donahue E.H. Dawson L.F. Valiente E. Firth-Clark S. Major M.R.

https://openalex.org/W3004620128,"Hepatitis E is an enteric disease highly prevalent in the developing countries. The basis for high mortality among pregnant hepatitis E patients remains unclear. Importantly, a large proportion of infected pregnant women present with subclinical infection as well. In order to understand the possible mechanisms influencing clinical presentation of hepatitis E in pregnant women, we explored a system biology approach. For this, PBMCs from various categories were subjected to RNAseq analysis. These included non-pregnant (NPR, acute and convalescent phases) and pregnant (PR, 2nd and 3rd trimesters, acute phase and subclinical HEV infections) patients and corresponding healthy controls. The current study deals with immune response genes. In contrast to exclusive up-regulation of nonspecific, early immune response transcripts in the NPR patients, the PR patients exhibited broader and heightened expression of genes associated with innate as well as adaptive T and B cell responses. The study identified for the first time (1) inverse relationship of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes overexpression and (2) association of differential expression of S100 series genes with disease presentation. The data suggests possible involvement of TLR4 and NOD1 in pregnant patients and alpha defensins in all patient categories suggesting a role in protection. Induction of IFNγ gene was not detected during the acute phase irrespective of pregnancy. Association of response to vitamin D, transcripts related to NK/NKT and regulatory T cells during subclinical infection are noteworthy. The data obtained here could be correlated with several studies reported earlier in hepatitis E patients suggesting utility of PBMCs as an alternate specimen. The extensive, informative data provided here for the first time should form basis for future studies that will help in understanding pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis E."
https://openalex.org/W3004525545,"Achieving an optimal configuration of the diffuser is indispensable for high pump performances. In this work, a numerical study on diffuser configuration is conducted for a high pump performance using a computational fluid dynamics code, and the effects of the wrap angle and the relative position of the diffuser vane to the impeller on pump performances are included. The results indicate that the modified diffuser with a suitable wrap angle may improve the pump hydraulic efficiency and the head by approximately 4% and 8%, respectively, while a suitable position of the diffuser vane can enhance the pump head by more than 4%. Meanwhile, the pressure recovery coefficient and the local Euler head of the diffuser are adopted to evaluate the diffuser performance. For a high pump performance, the local Euler head of the diffuser has a peak value at the leading edge with the change rate of zero along the meridian streamline, meaning that no blade loading at the leading edge of the diffuser guarantees a better match between the impeller and the diffuser."
https://openalex.org/W3005106817,"Individuals who engage in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) often report significant interpersonal difficulties, with studies lending support to the idea of impaired social interactions. Perceptual processing deficits of facial expressions have also been associated with interpersonal difficulties, yet little research has assessed how individuals with a history of NSSI (HNSSI) process facial emotions. This study used an ideal observer analysis to assess emotion processing capabilities of these individuals. A total of 30 HNSSI and 31 controls were presented with static images of various facial expressions (fear, anger, disgust, happiness, sadness, surprise) at three intensity levels (50%, 75% and 100% emotion expressivity). Recognition of emotions were measured by signal-proportion thresholds, efficiency scores, and unbiased hit rate. Error responses were also recorded to investigate errors biases made by each group. No significant differences between HNSSI and controls were found in signal-proportion thresholds or efficiency scores. Decreased accuracy of HNSSI participants for recognizing fearful expressions was observed. An increased likelihood of mistaking angry for happy expressions and a decreased likelihood of mistaking sad for surprised expressions were recorded for the HNSSI group compared to controls. These findings provide support to the literature reporting deficits in accurate emotion identification for those engaged in NSSI behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W2887769799,"Millions of volunteers take part in clinical trials every year. This is unsurprising, given that clinical trials are often much more lucrative than other types of unskilled work. When clinical trials offer very high pay, however, some people consider them repugnant. To understand why, we asked 1,428 respondents to evaluate a hypothetical medical trial for a new Ebola vaccine offering three different payment amounts. Some respondents (27%) used very high pay (£10,000) as a cue to infer the potential risks the clinical trial posed. These respondents were also concerned that offering £10,000 was coercive— simply too profitable to pass up. Both perceived risk and coercion in high-paying clinical trials shape how people evaluate these trials. This result was robust within and between respondents. The link between risk and repugnance may generalize to other markets in which parties are partially remunerated for the risk they take and contributes to a more complete understanding of why some market transactions appear repugnant."
https://openalex.org/W3004573713,"People suffering from glaucoma often endure high intra-ocular pressure (IOP). Methods for determining IOP either contact the eye or are unpleasant to some patients. There is therefore a need for a rapid and patient friendly non-contacting method to determine IOP. To address this need, we developed a tonometer prototype that employs spark-gap induced shock waves and a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) that reads the amplitude of membrane waves. The IOP was first identified from the membrane wave propagation velocity first in a custom-made ocular phantom and was then verified in ex vivo porcine eyes. The time-of-flight (TOF) of the membrane wave travelling on a hemispherical membrane was compared to reference IOP values in the sample obtained with an iCare TA01 tonometer. The shock front was characterized by high speed photography. Within one eye, the method achieved an agreement of 5 mmHg (1.96 standard deviation between the shock wave tonometer and the commercial manometer) and high method-to-method association (Pearson correlation, R2 = 0.98). The results indicate that the presented method could potentially be developed into a non-contacting technique for measuring IOP in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3004292968,"The class III histone deacetylase sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) modulates numerous functions in the cell by deacetylating histone lysine residues. Interestingly, SIRT6's efficiency in in vitro experiments is far greater against substrates carrying long-chain fatty acyl modifications such as myristoylated lysine compared with acetylated counterparts, but the deacetylase activity can be stimulated by fatty acids and small-molecule allosteric modulators. A new study helps to explain this puzzling activation using a novel activator, thorough kinetic investigation, and mutagenesis studies. These data help elucidate the molecular requirements for activation of SIRT6 and provide a foundation for development of activators for therapeutic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W3005323134,"Ventricle retraining has been extensively studied by our laboratory. Previous studies have demonstrated that intermittent overload causes a more efficient ventricular hypertrophy. The adaptive mechanisms involved in the ventricle retraining are not completely established. This study assessed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in the ventricles of goats submitted to systolic overload.Twenty-one young goats were divided into 3 groups (7 animals each): control, 96-hour continuous systolic overload, and intermittent systolic overload (four 12-hour periods of systolic overload paired with 12-hour resting period). During the 96-hour protocol, systolic overload was adjusted to achieve a right ventricular (RV) / aortic pressure ratio of 0.7. Hemodynamic evaluations were performed daily before and after systolic overload. Echocardiograms were obtained preoperatively and at protocol end to measure cardiac masses thickness. At study end, the animals were killed for morphologic evaluation and immunohistochemical assessment of VEGF expression.RV-trained groups developed hypertrophy of RV and septal masses, confirmed by increased weight and thickness, as expected. In the study groups, there was a small but significantly increased water content of the RV and septum compared with those in the control group (p<0.002). VEGF expression in the RV myocardium was greater in the intermittent group (2.89% ± 0.41%) than in the continuous (1.80% ± 0.19%) and control (1.43% ± 0.18%) groups (p<0.023).Intermittent systolic overload promotes greater upregulation of VEGF expression in the subpulmonary ventricle, an adaptation that provides a mechanism for increased myocardial perfusion during the rapid myocardial hypertrophy of young goats."
