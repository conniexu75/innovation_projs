https://openalex.org/W3198399896,"It has been widely observed that adult men of all ages are at higher risk of developing serious complications from COVID-19 when compared with women. This study aimed to investigate the association of COVID-19 positivity and severity with estrogen exposure in women, in a population based matched cohort study of female users of the COVID Symptom Study application in the UK. Analyses included 152,637 women for menopausal status, 295,689 women for exogenous estrogen intake in the form of the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP), and 151,193 menopausal women for hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Data were collected using the COVID Symptom Study in May-June 2020. Analyses investigated associations between predicted or tested COVID-19 status and menopausal status, COCP use, and HRT use, adjusting for age, smoking and BMI, with follow-up age sensitivity analysis, and validation in a subset of participants from the TwinsUK cohort. Menopausal women had higher rates of predicted COVID-19 (P = 0.003). COCP-users had lower rates of predicted COVID-19 (P = 8.03E-05), with reduction in hospital attendance (P = 0.023). Menopausal women using HRT or hormonal therapies did not exhibit consistent associations, including increased rates of predicted COVID-19 (P = 2.22E-05) for HRT users alone. The findings support a protective effect of estrogen exposure on COVID-19, based on positive association between predicted COVID-19 with menopausal status, and negative association with COCP use. HRT use was positively associated with COVID-19, but the results should be considered with caution due to lack of data on HRT type, route of administration, duration of treatment, and potential unaccounted for confounders and comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W3197258770,"Background There is an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies for reversing COVID-19-related lung inflammation. Recent evidence has demonstrated that the cholesterol-lowering agents, statins, are associated with reduced mortality in patients with various respiratory infections. We sought to investigate the relationship between statin use and COVID-19 disease severity in hospitalized patients. Methods A retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patients admitted to the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions between March 1, 2020 and June 30, 2020 was performed. The outcomes of interest were mortality and severe COVID-19 infection, as defined by prolonged hospital stay (≥ 7 days) and/ or invasive mechanical ventilation. Logistic regression, Cox proportional hazards regression and propensity score matching were used to obtain both univariable and multivariable associations between covariates and outcomes in addition to the average treatment effect of statin use. Results Of the 4,447 patients who met our inclusion criteria, 594 (13.4%) patients were exposed to statins on admission, of which 340 (57.2%) were male. The mean age was higher in statin users compared to non-users [64.9 ± 13.4 vs. 45.5 ± 16.6 years, p &lt;0.001]. The average treatment effect of statin use on COVID-19-related mortality was RR = 1.00 (95% CI: 0.99–1.01, p = 0.928), while its effect on severe COVID-19 infection was RR = 1.18 (95% CI: 1.11–1.27, p &lt;0.001). Conclusion Statin use was not associated with altered mortality, but with an 18% increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection."
https://openalex.org/W3196315194,"Large changes have taken place in smallholder farming systems in South Asia's coastal areas in recent decades, particularly related to cropping intensity, input availability, climate risks, and off-farm activities. However, few studies have investigated the extent to which these changes have impacted farm-level crop productivity, which is a key driver of food security and poverty in rainfed, low-input, rice-based systems. The objective of this study was to conduct an integrated assessment of variables related to socioeconomic status, farm characteristics, and crop management practices to understand the major factors influencing crop productivity and identify promising leverage points for sustainable development in coastal Bangladesh. Using a panel survey dataset of 32 variables from 502 farm households located within polder (coastal embankment) and outside polder systems during 2005-2015, we employed statistical factor analysis to characterize five independent latent factors named here as Farming Challenges, Economic Status, Crop Management Practices, Asset Endowment, and Farm Characteristics. The factor Farming Challenges explained the most variation among households (31%), with decreases observed over time, specifically households located outside polders. Individual variables contributing to this factor included perceived cyclone severity, household distance to main roads and input-output markets, cropping intensity, and access to extension services. The most important factors for increasing crop productivity on a household and per unit area basis were Asset Endowment and Crop Management Practices, respectively. The former highlights the need for increasing gross cropped area, which can be achieved through greater cropping intensity, while the latter was associated with increased fertilizer, labor, and pesticide input use. Despite the importance of these factors, household poverty trajectory maps showed that changes in off-farm income had played the strongest role in improving livelihoods in this coastal area. This study can help inform development efforts and policies for boosting farm-level crop productivity, specifically through agricultural intensification (higher cropping intensity combined with appropriate and efficient use of inputs) and expanding opportunities for off-farm income as key pathways to bring smallholder households out of poverty."
https://openalex.org/W3196611333,"Background The objective of this cohort study was to determine whether elevated CRP in early COVID-19 was associated with 14-day mortality in geriatric patients. Methods Plasma CRP levels at hospital admission and 14-day all-cause mortality were assessed in geriatric inpatients hospitalized for COVID-19. Potential confounders were age, sex, functional abilities, history of malignancies, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, albuminemia, number of acute health issues, use of antibiotics and respiratory treatments. Results Ninety-five participants (mean±SD 88.0±5.5years; 49.5%women; mean CRP, 76.7±77.5mg/L; mean albuminemia, 32.9±6.0g/L) were included. Sixteen participants who did not survive at day 14 exhibited higher CRP level at baseline than the others (120.3±71.2 versus 67.9±76.1 mg/L, P = 0.002). There was no difference in albuminemia (P = 0.329). Plasma CRP level was directly associated with 14-day mortality (fully adjusted HR = 1.11, P = 0.025). The cut-off for CRP associated with 14-day mortality was set at 35mg/L (sensitivity = 0.88; specificity = 0.56). Those with CRP&lt;35mg/L had longer survival time than the others (log-rank P&lt;0.001). Conclusions Elevated CRP levels were associated with poorer 14-day survival in hospitalized geriatric COVID-19 patients."
https://openalex.org/W3196292936,"Background Critical illness is common throughout the world and has been the focus of a dramatic increase in attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Severely deranged vital signs such as hypoxia, hypotension and low conscious level can identify critical illness. These vital signs are simple to check and treatments that aim to correct derangements are established, basic and low-cost. The aim of the study was to estimate the unmet need of such essential treatments for severely deranged vital signs in all adults admitted to hospitals in Malawi. Methods We conducted a point prevalence cross-sectional study of adult hospitalized patients in Malawi. All in-patients aged ≥18 on single days Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) and Chiradzulu District Hospital (CDH) were screened. Patients with hypoxia (oxygen saturation &lt;90%), hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt;90mmHg) and reduced conscious level (Glasgow Coma Scale &lt;9) were included in the study. The a-priori defined essential treatments were oxygen therapy for hypoxia, intravenous fluid for hypotension and an action to protect the airway for reduced consciousness (placing the patient in the lateral position, insertion of an oro-pharyngeal airway or endo-tracheal tube or manual airway protection). Results Of the 1135 hospital in-patients screened, 45 (4.0%) had hypoxia, 103 (9.1%) had hypotension, and 17 (1.5%) had a reduced conscious level. Of those with hypoxia, 40 were not receiving oxygen (88.9%). Of those with hypotension, 94 were not receiving intravenous fluids (91.3%). Of those with a reduced conscious level, nine were not receiving an action to protect the airway (53.0%). Conclusion There was a large unmet need of essential treatments for critical illness in two hospitals in Malawi."
https://openalex.org/W3198308799,"Soil microorganisms are important components of agricultural ecosystems; they are important in agricultural soil nutrient cycle and are easily affected by soil tillage. The response of soil microbial community to tillage is very complex, and the effect of the no tillage and residue mulching method on soil microbial diversity remains unclear. In 2019, the soil was collected from an experimental field after 10 years of continuous cultivation in the black soil area of the Sanjiang Plain in Northeastern China. In this study, the diversity and composition of the soil bacterial community and their relationship with soil properties were explored via high-throughput sequencing under no tillage with four residue mulching treatments. No tillage with 60% residue mulching (NTR3) significantly increased the alpha diversity of the rhizosphere soil bacteria and changed the composition of the bacterial community—consistent with changes in soil physicochemical properties. Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the dominant phyla in the sample soil. Soil physicochemical properties explained 80.6% of the changes in soil diversity and composition, of which soil organic carbon, soil pH, and soil temperature were the principal contributors. Our results suggest that no tillage and residue mulching is conducive to increasing soil organic carbon and soil nutrient content, which is a beneficial conservation tillage measure for black soil protection in Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China. The no tillage with residue mulching, especially 60% residue mulching, alters soil bacterial community and highlights the importance of soil physicochemical properties in shaping the diversity and composition of the soil bacterial community. Our findings contribute to a broad understanding of the effects of no tillage and residue mulching on bacterial community differences and provide a scientific basis for the optimization of no tillage measures and sustainable utilization of the black soil of the Sanjiang Plain in Northeastern China."
https://openalex.org/W3197286334,"The purpose of this study was to examine to what extent the physical match performance of professional soccer players is both position and player specific. First, official match data from the 2019/20 German Bundesliga season was used to search for players that met the inclusion criteria of playing a minimum of four entire matches in at least two different playing positions. Overall, 25 players met the criteria prior to the COVID-19 induced break, playing a minimum of eight matches. Second, the physical match performance of these players was analyzed separately for each position they played. The following four parameters were captured: total distance, high-intensity distance, sprinting distance, and accelerations. Third, the 25 players’ physical match performance data was then compared to normative data for each position they played to understand whether players adapted their physical performance (position dependent), or maintained their performance regardless of which position they were assigned to (position independent). When switching the position, the change in physical match performance of the respective players could be explained by 44–58% through the normative positional data. Moreover, there existed large individual differences in the way players adapted or maintained their performance when acting in different positions. Coaches and practitioners should be aware that some professional soccer players will likely incur differences in the composition of physical match performance when switching positions and therefore should pay special consideration for such differences in the training and recovery process of these players."
https://openalex.org/W3197198990,"The vast majority of plant viruses are unenveloped, i.e., they lack a lipid bilayer that is characteristic of most animal viruses. The interactions between plant viruses, and between viruses and surfaces, properties that are essential for understanding their infectivity and to their use as bionanomaterials, are largely controlled by their surface charge, which depends on pH and ionic strength. They may also depend on the charge of their contents, i.e., of their genes or-in the instance of virus-like particles-encapsidated cargo such as nucleic acid molecules, nanoparticles or drugs. In the case of enveloped viruses, the surface charge of the capsid is equally important for controlling its interaction with the lipid bilayer that it acquires and loses upon leaving and entering host cells. We have previously investigated the charge on the unenveloped plant virus Cowpea Chlorotic Mottle Virus (CCMV) by measurements of its electrophoretic mobility. Here we examine the electrophoretic properties of a structurally and genetically closely related bromovirus, Brome Mosaic Virus (BMV), of its capsid protein, and of its empty viral shells, as functions of pH and ionic strength, and compare them with those of CCMV. From measurements of both solution and gel electrophoretic mobilities (EMs) we find that the isoelectric point (pI) of BMV (5.2) is significantly higher than that of CCMV (3.7), that virion EMs are essentially the same as those of the corresponding empty capsids, and that the same is true for the pIs of the virions and of their cleaved protein subunits. We discuss these results in terms of current theories of charged colloidal particles and relate them to biological processes and the role of surface charge in the design of new classes of drug and gene delivery systems."
https://openalex.org/W3168501232,"In the risky-choice framing effect, different wording of the same options leads to predictably different choices. In a large-scale survey conducted from March to May 2020 and including 88,181 participants from 47 countries, we investigated how stress, concerns, and trust moderated the effect in the Disease problem, a prominent framing problem highly evocative of the COVID-19 pandemic. As predicted by the appraisal-tendency framework, risk aversion and the framing effect in our study were larger than under typical circumstances. Furthermore, perceived stress and concerns over coronavirus were positively associated with the framing effect. Contrary to predictions, however, they were not related to risk aversion. Trust in the government’s efforts to handle the coronavirus was associated with neither risk aversion nor the framing effect. The proportion of risky choices and the framing effect varied substantially across nations. Additional exploratory analyses showed that the framing effect was unrelated to reported compliance with safety measures, suggesting, along with similar findings during the pandemic and beyond, that the effectiveness of framing manipulations in public messages might be limited. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed, along with directions for further investigations."
https://openalex.org/W3197599826,"Background/aim We investigated alterations in the expression of serum exosomal miRNAs with the progression of liver fibrosis and evaluated their clinical applicability as biomarkers. Methods This study prospectively enrolled 71 patients who underwent liver biopsy at an academic hospital in Korea. Exosomes were extracted from serum samples, followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of miRNAs and targeted real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A model was derived to discriminate advanced fibrosis based on miRNA levels and the performance of this model was evaluated. Validation of the effect of miRNA on liver fibrosis in vitro was followed. Results NGS data revealed that exosomal miR-660-5p, miR-125a-5p, and miR-122 expression were changed significantly with the progression of liver fibrosis, of which miR-122 exhibited high read counts enough to be used as a biomarker. The level of exosomal miR-122 decreased as the pathologic fibrosis grade progressed and patients with biopsy-proven advanced fibrosis had significantly lower levels of exosomal miR-122 ( P &lt; 0.001) than those without advanced fibrosis. Exosomal miR-122 exhibited a fair performance in discriminating advanced fibrosis especially in combination with fibrosis-4 score and transient elastography. In a subgroup of patients with a non-viral etiology of liver disease, the performance of exosomal miR-122 as a biomarker was greatly improved. Inhibition of miR-122 expression increased the proliferation of the human hepatic stellate cell line, LX-2, and upregulated the expression of various fibrosis related proteins. Conclusion Exosomal miR-122 may serve as a useful non-invasive biomarker for liver fibrosis, especially in patients with non-viral etiologies of chronic liver disease."
https://openalex.org/W3197588495,"Purpose Previous studies have rarely attempted to test the confounding factors that may affect learning outcomes of the flipped classroom. The purpose of this study was to assess how flipped classrooms affect the acquisition of knowledge in clinical dental education based on multilevel factor analysis. Method The authors conducted a 3-year (2017, 2018, and 2019) randomized controlled trial in a series of introductory prosthodontics courses in dental education. A total of 137 participants were randomly assigned to flipped classroom (n = 70, 51%) or lecture (n = 67, 49%) formats. The flipped group was instructed to self-learn knowledge-based content through online preparation materials, including videos and text, while the lecture group was given text only. Both groups were provided with the same study content and opportunities for different styles of learning. The session attendance rate and number of times the materials were accessed were monitored. Individual and team readiness assurance tests (IRAT/TRAT) were conducted to evaluate knowledge acquisition. A multilevel linear regression analysis was conducted on both instructional styles (flipped vs. lecture) as an intervention factor, and confounding factors that could affect the outcomes were implemented. Results The average number of online accesses was 2.5 times per session in the flipped group and 1.2 in the lecture group, with a significant difference (p &lt; .05). The average IRAT score was significantly higher in the flipped than in the lecture group (effect size [ES] 0.58, p &lt; .001). The number of online accesses was significantly and positively correlated with IRAT scores (0.6 [0.4, 0.8]). The instructional style was significantly and positively correlated with TRAT scores (coefficient [95% confidence interval]: 4.6 [2.0, 7.3]), but it was not correlated with IRAT (4.3 [-0.45, 9.0]). Conclusions The flipped classroom was more effective than the lecture format regarding knowledge acquisition; however, the decisive factor was not the instructional style but the number of individual learning occasions. The employment of the flipped classroom was the decisive factor for team-based learning outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3197949657,"Gardenia jasminoides Ellis (G. jasminoides) fruits are used as a resource for obtaining natural colorants and in traditional Chinese herbal medicine. However, G. jasminoides presents a relatively long flowering period and different ripening periods, so there are significant differences in the accumulation of metabolites in fruits of different colors. In addition, the complete metabolic pathways of iridoidsand crocins, which are used as medicinal composition of G. jasminoides, are poorly understood at present. In this research, we comprehensively compared the transcriptome and metabolites profiles of the developmental stages and locations of iridoid and crocin biosynthesis. A large number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were detected in four groups of samples, and clear variation in the pattern of metabolite abundance and gene expression were observed among different fruit colors and parts. Geniposide and gardenoside mainly accumulated in the sarcocarp of green fruit (GFS) and the sarcocarp of red fruit (FS), respectively. Crocin mainly accumulated in the peel and sarcocarp of red fruits. In the iridoid pathway, we hypothesized that there was a transport mechanism from the sarcocarp to the peel of G. jasminoides because of the inconsistent expression of G8O, 10-HGO and IS associated with differences in fruit ripening. UGTs play an important role in the biosynthesis of the active components of G. jasminoides. Combined transcriptome and metabonomics analysis showed a negative correlation between the biosynthesis of geniposide and crocin. The redirection of the metabolic flux and the regulation of key enzymes may be the main reasons for the changes in the biosynthesis of iridoid and crocin in G. jasminoides fruit. Our study expended valuable information for functional genomic library and provided new insights for metabolic engineering of secondary metabolite in G. Jasminoides."
https://openalex.org/W3198528362,"Background The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was characterized by rapid increases in Emergency department (ED) patient visits. EDs required an appropriate transformation. The main challenges were: adapting capacity to respond to surges in the number of patient visits, protection of high risk (frontline) staff and the segregation of suspect-COVID-19 patients. To date, only a few studies have assessed the nation-wide response of EDs to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was designed to review the preparations of Dutch EDs during the initial phase of this public health crisis. Methods The study was designed as a nation-wide, cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study of Dutch hospital organizations having one or more EDs. One respondent completed the questionnaire for each hospital. The questionnaire was conducted between the first and the second COVID-19 wave in the Netherlands. It contained close-ended and open-ended questions on changes in ED infrastructure, ED workforce adaptions and the role of emergency physicians (EPs) in each hospital crisis management team. Results The questionnaire was completed by 58 respondents. This represented 80% of the total number of EDs. All respondents had made preparations in anticipation of a COVID-19 patient surge. Treatment capacity was expanded in 70% of EDs, with a median increase of 49% (IQR 33–73%). Suspect-COVID-19 was segregated from non-COVID-19 patients in 89% of EDs. Alternative locations (such as outpatient departments) were more often used to assess non-COVID-19 patients, than for suspect-COVID-19 patients. Staff was expanded in 82% of EDs. This largely concerned nursing staff. A formal role for Emergency Physicians (EPs) in the hospital’s crisis management team was reported by 94% of hospital organizations employing EPs. Conclusion All Dutch EDs responded to the COVID-19 pandemic in a very short time span despite much uncertainty. Preparations predominantly concerned expansion of treatment capacity and segregation of COVID-19 ED care. EPs played a prominent role, both in direct COVID-19 care and in the hospital crises management team. It is vital for EDs to adapt to community needs swiftly. The ability of EDs to respond to the pandemic varied considerably."
https://openalex.org/W3196950835,"The temporal binding window refers to the time frame within which temporal grouping of sensory information takes place. Sense of agency is the feeling of being in control of one's actions, and their associated outcomes. While previous research has shown that temporal cues and multisensory integration play a role in sense of agency, no studies have directly assessed whether individual differences in the temporal binding window and sense of agency are associated. In all three experiments, to assess sense of agency, participants pressed a button triggering, after a varying delay, the appearance of the circle, and reported their sense of agency over the effect. To assess the temporal binding window a simultaneity judgment task (Experiment 1) and a double-flash illusion task (Experiment 2 and 3) was also performed. As expected, the temporal binding window correlated with the sense of agency window. In Experiment 3, these processes were modulated by applying occipital tACS at either 14Hz or 8Hz. We found 14Hz tACS stimulation was associated with narrower temporal biding window and sense of agency window. Our results suggest the temporal binding window and the time window of sense of agency are related. They also point towards a possible underlying neural mechanism (alpha peak frequency) for this association."
https://openalex.org/W3161485252,"Background The aim of this research was to investigate the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown (March 17 th —May 11 th 2020) on violence against women in France. Methods A prospective survey was conducted online between April 2th 2020 and July 5 th 2020. Female respondents were recruited from social media networks using the snowball sampling method. Data were collected three times: during (2–19 April) and at the end (11–25 May) of the first lockdown, and following the first lockdown (20 June– 05 July). Sociodemographic variables, lockdown living conditions, financial impact of COVID, and history of psychiatric disorder were evaluated, together with changes in psychological distress over the lockdown period, and the risk of being assaulted post lockdown. Results Psychological distress was elevated and remained stable for most of the 1538 female respondents during lockdown. More than 7% of women were affected by physical or sexual violence post lockdown. Unwanted sexual contact accounted for the majority of abuse, but physical and sexual assault were also prevalent. The risk of being abused was higher for participants who had changed anxiety/insomnia symptoms over the lockdown period, and a history of abuse. Discussion Women who experienced changes in anxiety/insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown were at higher risk than others of being assaulted post lockdown, especially when they were already socially vulnerable. While social and psychological factors accounting for these changes warrant further investigation, communication and preventive measures during pandemics should include initiatives tailored to women more vulnerable to violence."
https://openalex.org/W3196553938,"Available evidence suggests that provision of quality of care in family planning services is crucial to increasing uptake and continuation of use of contraception. Kenya achieved a modern contraceptive prevalence rate of 60% in 2018, surpassing its 2020 target of 58%. With the high prevalence, focus is geared towards improved quality of family planning services. The objective of this study is to examine the quality of family planning counseling and its associated factors in health facilities in Kenya.We conducted a secondary analysis of the 2019 Kenya Performance Monitoring and Action, client exit data of women who had received family planning services. Quality of counseling was assessed using the Method Information Index Plus. We conducted a multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis of data from 3,731 women to establish determinants of receiving quality family planning services.The Method Information Index Plus score for higher-quality counseling was 56.7%, lower-quality counseling 32.4%, and no counseling 10.9%. Women aged 15-24 years (aOR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.56-0.86, p = 0.001) had lower odds of receiving better counseling compared to women aged 35 years and above. Those with no education (aOR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.33-0.82, p = 0.005), primary (aOR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.44-0.71, p<0.001) and secondary (aOR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.65-0.98, p = 0.028) were less likely to receive better counseling compared to those with tertiary education. Women who received long acting and reversible contraception methods (aOR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.42-2.17, p<0.001), and those who were method switchers (aOR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.03-1.50, p = 0.027), had a higher likelihood of receiving better quality of counseling as compared to those on short-term methods and those who were continuers, respectively.The quality of family planning counseling in Kenya is still sub-optimal considering that some women receive no form of counseling at service delivery point. There is need to review the existing FP guidelines and training packages to increase focus on the quality of counseling services offered by health providers. Social accountability strategies that empower women to demand quality services should be included in community-level family planning interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3197125297,"Myotoxicity is one of the common clinical manifestations of red-bellied black snake (Pseudechis porphyriacus) envenomation characterised by elevated creatine kinase (CK) concentrations of greater than 1000 U/L. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of myotoxicity in patients following envenomation.Patient characteristics and serial blood samples (timed venom concentrations and CK concentrations, pre- and post- antivenom) from 114 patients (median age 41, 2-90y; 80 male) were extracted from the Australian Snakebite Project database. Patients were categorised into three groups based on peak CK concentrations [no myotoxicity (<1000 U/L), mild (1000-10,000 U/L) and severe (>10,000 U/L)]. The odds of (mild or severe) myotoxicity was lower in patients that received early antivenom (within 6 hours post-bite) compared to those that received late or no antivenom (odd ratio was 0.186; 95% confidence interval, 0.052-0.664). A population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model was developed to describe the relationship between the time course of venom (a mixture of toxins) and effect (elevated CK). In addition, a kinetic-pharmacodynamic (KPD) model was developed to describe the relationship between time course of a theoretical toxin and effect. Model development and parameter estimation was performed using NONMEM v7.3. No single set of parameter values from either the PKPD or KPD models were found that could accurately describe the time course of different levels of severity of myotoxicity. The predicted theoretical toxin half-life from the KPD model was 11 ± 3.9 hours compared to the half-life of venom of 5.3 ± 0.36 hours. This indicates that the putative causative toxin's concentration-time profile does not parallel that of venom.Early antivenom administration reduces the incidence of myotoxicity. The venom concentration profile does not appear to be the driver for myotoxicity following envenomation. Additional factors that affect the sensitivity of the patient to snake venom/toxins must be explored to understand the relationship with myotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W3197970795,"KR2 from marine bacteria Krokinobacter eikastus is a light-driven Na+ pumping rhodopsin family (NaRs) member that actively transports Na+ and/or H+ depending on the ionic state. We here report electrophysiological studies on KR2 to address ion-transport properties under various electrochemical potentials of Δ[Na+], ΔpH, membrane voltage and light quality, because the contributions of these on the pumping activity were less understood so far. After transient expression of KR2 in mammalian cultured cells (ND7/23 cells), photocurrents were measured by whole-cell patch clamp under various intracellular Na+ and pH conditions. When KR2 was continuously illuminated with LED light, two distinct time constants were obtained depending on the Na+ concentration. KR2 exhibited slow ion transport (τoff of 28 ms) below 1.1 mM NaCl and rapid transport (τoff of 11 ms) above 11 mM NaCl. This indicates distinct transporting kinetics of H+ and Na+. Photocurrent amplitude (current density) depends on the intracellular Na+ concentration, as is expected for a Na+ pump. The M-intermediate in the photocycle of KR2 could be transferred into the dark state without net ion transport by blue light illumination on top of green light. The M intermediate was stabilized by higher membrane voltage. Furthermore, we assessed the optogenetic silencing effect of rat cortical neurons after expressing KR2. Light power dependency revealed that action potential was profoundly inhibited by 1.5 mW/mm2 green light illumination, confirming the ability to apply KR2 as an optogenetics silencer."
https://openalex.org/W3198155052,"Background Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) in Indonesia is still high, 305, compared to 240 deaths per 100,000 in South East Asian Region. The use of Traditional Birth Attendance (TBA) as a cascade for maternal health and delivery, suspected to be the pocket of the MMR problem. The study aimed to assess the influence of traditional practices on maternal health services in Indonesia. Methods We used two data sets of national surveys for this secondary data analysis. The samples included 14,798 mothers whose final delivery was between January 2005 and August 2010. The dependent variables were utilization of maternal healthcare, including receiving antenatal care (ANC≥4), attended by skilled birth attendance (SBA), and having a facility-based delivery (FBD). The independent variables were the use of traditional practices, type of family structure, and TBA density. We run a Multivariate logistic regression for the analysis by controlling all the covariates. Results Traditional practices and high TBA density have significantly inhibited the mother’s access to maternal health services. Mothers who completed antenatal care were 15.6% lost the cascade of facility-based delivery. The higher the TBA population, the lower cascade of the use of Maternal Health Services irrespective of the economic quintile. Mothers in villages with a high TBA density had significantly lower odds (AOR = 0.30; CI = 0.24–0.38; p&lt;0.01) than mothers in towns with low TBA density. Moreover, mothers who lived in an extended family had positively significantly higher odds (AOR = 1.33, CI = 1.17–1.52; p&lt;0.01) of using maternal health services. Discussion Not all mothers who have received proper antenatal delivered the baby in health care facilities or preferred a traditional birth attendance instead. Traditional practices influenced the ideal utilization of maternal health care. Maternal health care utilization can be improved by community empowerment through the maternal health policy to easier mothers get delivery in a health care facility."

However, they are increasingly under threat from anthropogenic pressures that may exacerbate already intense intra-guild competition. Understanding the coexistence mechanisms employed by these species in human-impacted landscapes could help shed light on some of the more subtle ways in which humans may impact wildlife populations, and inform multi-species conservation planning. We used camera trap data from Tanzania’s Ruaha-Rungwa landscape to explore temporal and spatiotemporal associations between members of an intact East African large carnivore guild, and determine how these varied across gradients of anthropogenic impact and protection. All large carnivores except African wild dog ( Lycaon pictus ) exhibited predominantly nocturnal road-travel behaviour. Leopard ( Panthera pardus ) appeared to employ minor temporal avoidance of lion ( Panthera leo ) in all sites except those where human impacts were highest, suggesting that leopard may have been freed up from avoidance of lion in areas where the dominant competitor was less abundant, or that the need for leopard to avoid humans outweighed the need to avoid sympatric competitors. Lion appeared to modify their activity patterns to avoid humans in the most impacted areas. We also found evidence of avoidance and attraction among large carnivores: lion and spotted hyaena ( Crocuta crocuta ) followed leopard; leopard avoided lion; spotted hyaena followed lion; and lion avoided spotted hyaena. Our findings suggest that large carnivores in Ruaha-Rungwa employ fine-scale partitioning mechanisms to facilitate coexistence with both sympatric species and humans, and that growing human pressures may interfere with these behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W3198151334,"Six to eight months after total hip arthroplasty, patients only attain 80% of the functional level of control groups. Understanding which functional tasks are most affected could help reduce this deficit by guiding rehabilitation towards them. The timed up-and-go test bundles multiple tasks together in one test and is a good indicator of a patient's overall level of function. Previously, biomechanical analysis of its phases was used to identify specific functional deficits in pathological populations. To the best of our knowledge, this analysis has never been performed in patients who have undergone total hip arthroplasty. Seventy-one total hip arthroplasty patients performed an instrumented timed up-and-go test in a gait laboratory before and six months after surgery; fifty-two controls performed it only once. Biomechanical features were selected to analyse the test's four phases (sit-to-stand, walking, turning, turn-to-sit) and mean differences between groups were evaluated for each phase. On average, six months after surgery, patients' overall test time rose to 80% of the mean of the control group. The walking phase was revealed as the main deficiency before and after surgery (-41 ± 47% and -22 ± 32% slower, respectively). High standard deviations indicated that variability between patients was high. On average, patients showed improved results in every phase of the timed up-and-go test six months after surgery, but residual deficits in function differed between those phases. This simple test could be appropriate for quantifying patient-specific deficits in function and hence guiding and monitoring post-operative rehabilitation in clinical settings."

The main objective of this trial was to identify the most effective method of delivering dihydroartemesinin-piperaquine to children recovering from severe anemia.This was a 5-arm, cluster-randomized trial among under-5 children hospitalized with severe anemia at Zomba Central Hospital in Southern Malawi. Children were randomized to receive three day treatment doses of dihydroartemesinin-piperaquine monthly either; 1) in the community without a short text reminder; 2) in the community with a short message reminder; 3) in the community with a community health worker reminder; 4) at the facility without a short text reminder; or 5) at the facility with a short message reminder. The primary outcome measure was adherence to all treatment doses of dihydroartemesinin-piperaquine and this was assessed by pill-counts done by field workers during home visits. Poisson regression was utilized for analysis.Between March 2016 and October 2018, 1460 clusters were randomized. A total of 667 children were screened and 375 from 329 clusters were eligible and enrolled from the hospital. Adherence was higher in all three community-based compared to the two facility-based delivery (156/221 [70·6%] vs. 78/150 [52·0%], IRR = 1·24,95%CI 1·06-1·44, p = 0·006). This was observed in both the SMS group (IRR = 1·41,1·21-1·64, p<0·001) and in the non-SMS group (IRR = 1·37,1·18-1·61, p<0·001). Although adherence was higher among SMS recipients (98/148 66·2%] vs. non-SMS 82/144 (56·9%), there was no statistical evidence that SMS reminders resulted in greater adherence ([IRR = 1·03,0·88-1·21, p = 0·68). When compared to the facility-based non-SMS arm (control arm), community-based delivery utilizing CHWs resulted in higher adherence [39/76 (51·3%) vs. 54/79 (68·4%), IRR = 1·32, 1·14-1·54, p<0·001].Community-based delivery of dihydroartemesinin-piperaquine for post-discharge malaria chemoprevention in children recovering from severe anemia resulted in higher adherence compared to facility-based methods.NCT02721420; ClinicalTrials.gov."
https://openalex.org/W3198812230,"Pancreatic cancer remains a significant public health problem with an ever-rising incidence of disease. Cancers of the pancreas are characterised by various molecular aberrations, including changes in the proteomics and genomics landscape of the tumour cells. Therefore, there is a need to identify the proteomic landscape of pancreatic cancer and the specific genomic and molecular alterations associated with disease subtypes. Here, we carry out an integrative bioinformatics analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset, including proteomics and whole-exome sequencing data collected from pancreatic cancer patients. We apply unsupervised clustering on the proteomics dataset to reveal the two distinct subtypes of pancreatic cancer. Using functional and pathway analysis based on the proteomics data, we demonstrate the different molecular processes and signalling aberrations of the pancreatic cancer subtypes. In addition, we explore the clinical characteristics of these subtypes to show differences in disease outcome. Using datasets of mutations and copy number alterations, we show that various signalling pathways previously associated with pancreatic cancer are altered among both subtypes of pancreatic tumours, including the Wnt pathway, Notch pathway and PI3K-mTOR pathways. Altogether, we reveal the proteogenomic landscape of pancreatic cancer subtypes and the altered molecular processes that can be leveraged to devise more effective treatments."
https://openalex.org/W3196595867,"Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is the causative agent of enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL), a malignant B cell lymphoma. However, the mechanisms of BLV-associated lymphomagenesis remain poorly understood. Here, after deep sequencing, we performed comparative analyses of B cell microRNAs (miRNAs) in cattle infected with BLV and those without BLV. In BLV-infected cattle, BLV-derived miRNAs (blv-miRNAs) accounted for 38% of all miRNAs in B cells. Four of these blv-miRNAs (blv-miR-B1-5p, blv-miR-B2-5p, blv-miR-B4-3p, and blv-miR-B5-5p) had highly significant positive correlations with BLV proviral load (PVL). The read counts of 90 host-derived miRNAs (bta-miRNAs) were significantly down-regulated in BLV-infected cattle compared to those in uninfected cattle. Only bta-miR-375 had a positive correlation with PVL in BLV-infected cattle and was highly expressed in the B cell lymphoma tissue of EBL cattle. There were a few bta-miRNAs that correlated with BLV tax/rex gene expression; however, BLV AS1 expression had a significant negative correlation with many of the down-regulated bta-miRNAs that are important for tumor development and/or tumor suppression. These results suggest that BLV promotes lymphomagenesis via AS1 and blv-miRNAs, rather than tax/rex, by down-regulating the expression of bta-miRNAs that have a tumor-suppressing function, and this downregulation is linked to increased PVL."
https://openalex.org/W3197543851,"Bortezomib and the other licensed 20S proteasome inhibitors show robust activity against liquid tumors like multiple myeloma, but have disappointed against solid tumors including ovarian cancer. Consequently, interest is mounting in alternative non-peptide based drugs targeting the proteasome's 19S regulatory particle subunit, including its ubiquitin receptor RPN13. RA183 and RA375 are more potent analogs of the prototypic inhibitor of RPN13 (iRPN13) called RA190, and they show promise for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Here we demonstrate that rendering these candidate RPN13 inhibitors chiral and asymmetric through the addition of a single methyl to the core piperidone moiety increases their potency against cancer cell lines, with the S-isomer being more active than the R-isomer. The enhanced cancer cell cytotoxicities of these compounds are associated with improved binding to RPN13 in cell lysates, ATP depletion by inhibition of glycolysis and mitochondrial electron chain transport, mitochondrial depolarization and perinuclear clustering, oxidative stress and glutathione depletion, and rapid accumulation of high molecular weight polyubiquitinated proteins with a consequent unresolved ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) stress response. Cytotoxicity was associated with an early biomarker of apoptosis, increased surface annexin V binding. As for cisplatin, BRCA2 and ATM deficiency conferred increased sensitivity to these iRPN13s. Ubiquitination plays an important role in coordinating DNA damage repair and the iRPN13s may compromise this process by depletion of monomeric ubiquitin following its sequestration in high molecular weight polyubiquitinated protein aggregates. Indeed, a synergistic cytotoxic response was evident upon treatment of several ovarian cancer cell lines with either cisplatin or doxorubicin and our new candidate iRPN13s, suggesting that such a combination approach warrants further exploration for the treatment of ovarian cancer."

Health status was assessed upon presentation and at 12 months with the disease-specific Peripheral Artery Questionnaire (PAQ). Higher PAQ scores indicate better health status. A sequentially-adjusted hierarchical linear regression model examined the association between sleep apnea and 1-year PAQ symptoms, quality of life, and summary scores. Five-year survival curves by comorbid sleep apnea status for US patients were compared using the log-rank test.The mean age of the 1204 PORTRAIT participants was 67.6 ± 9.4 years with 37.5% women and 8.3% (n = 100) having sleep apnea. Patients with sleep apnea were more likely to be from the US, more sedentary, and to have diabetes, obesity, coronary disease, more depressive symptoms and a history of prior peripheral interventions. Paradoxically, they also had higher ankle-brachial indices, but lower PAQ Summary scores at presentation and 12 months (41.2 ± 22.0 vs. 49. 9± 21.6 and 58.6 ± 27.9 vs. 71.3 ± 24.9, respectively, p = <0.05). The association between sleep apnea and 1-year health status persisted after multivariable adjustment, but there were no differences in all-cause mortality over 5 years (28.0% vs. 23.4%, p = 0.76).In patients presenting with PAD, comorbid sleep apnea is independently associated with worse health status over time.

We map the adaptation engagement of the 30 IOs across organizations, across issue areas, and over time. This dataset can be used to compare adaptation activities across and within IOs, but also as an empirical foundation for the emerging research field of global adaptation governance, for which IO climate change adaptation activities are relevant."
https://openalex.org/W3197485349,"Metabolic disorders are associated with a higher risk of psychiatric disorders. We previously reported that 20-week-old Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty (OLETF) rats, a model of progressive type 2 diabetes, showed increased anxiety-like behavior and regional area reductions and increased cholecystokinin-positive neurons in the corticolimbic system. However, in which stages of diabetes these alterations in OLETF rats occur remains unclear. We aimed to investigate anxiety-like behavior and its possible mechanisms at different stages of type 2 diabetes in OLETF rats. Eight- and 30-week-old OLETF rats were used as diabetic animal models at the prediabetic and progressive stages of type 2 diabetes respectively, and age-matched Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka rats served as non-diabetic controls. In the open-field test, OLETF rats showed less locomotion in the center zone and longer latency to leave the center zone at 8 and 30 weeks old, respectively. The areas of the medial prefrontal cortex were smaller in the OLETF rats, regardless of age. The densities of cholecystokinin-positive neurons in OLETF rats were higher in the lateral and basolateral amygdala only at 8 weeks old and in the anterior cingulate and infralimbic cortices and hippocampal cornu ammonis area 3 at both ages. The densities of parvalbumin-positive neurons of OLETF rats were lower in the cornu ammonis area 2 at 8 weeks old and in the prelimbic and infralimbic cortices at both ages. No apoptotic cell death was detected in OLETF rats, but the percentage of neurons co-expressing activating transcription factor 4 and cholecystokinin and parvalbumin was higher in OLETF rats at both ages in the anterior cingulate cortex and basolateral amygdala, respectively. These results suggest that altered emotional behavior and related neurological changes in the corticolimbic system are already present in the prediabetic stage of OLETF rats."
https://openalex.org/W3197810513,"Purpose We aim to determine an advantageous approach for the acceleration of high spatial resolution 3D cardiac T2 relaxometry data by comparing the performance of different undersampling patterns and reconstruction methods over a range of acceleration rates. Methods Multi-volume 3D high-resolution cardiac images were acquired fully and undersampled retrospectively using 1) optimal CAIPIRINHA and 2) a variable density random (VDR) sampling. Data were reconstructed using 1) multi-volume sensitivity encoding (SENSE), 2) joint-sparsity SENSE and 3) model-based SENSE. Four metrics were calculated on 3 naïve swine and 8 normal human subjects over a whole left-ventricular region of interest: root-mean-square error (RMSE) of image signal intensity, RMSE of T2, the bias of mean T2, and standard deviation (SD) of T2. Fully sampled data and volume-by-volume SENSE with standard equally spaced undersampling were used as references. The Jaccard index calculated from one swine with acute myocardial infarction (MI) was used to demonstrate preservation of segmentation of edematous tissues with elevated T2. Results In naïve swine and normal human subjects, all methods had similar performance when the net reduction factor (R net ) &lt;2.5. VDR sampling with model-based SENSE showed the lowest RMSEs (10.5%-14.2%) and SDs (+1.7–2.4 ms) of T2 when R net &gt;2.5, while VDR sampling with the joint-sparsity SENSE had the lowest bias of mean T2 (0.0–1.1ms) when R net &gt;3. The RMSEs of parametric T2 values (9.2%-24.6%) were larger than for image signal intensities (5.2%-18.4%). In the swine with MI, VDR sampling with either joint-sparsity or model-based SENSE showed consistently higher Jaccard index for all R net (0.71–0.50) than volume-by-volume SENSE (0.68–0.30). Conclusions Retrospective exploration of undersampling and reconstruction in 3D whole-heart T2 parametric mapping revealed that maps were more sensitive to undersampling than images, presenting a more stringent limiting factor on R net . The combination of VDR sampling patterns with model-based or joint-sparsity SENSE reconstructions were more robust for R net &gt;3."
https://openalex.org/W3198347579,"Surface evapotranspiration is a water exchange process between the atmosphere, biosphere, and hydrosphere. Accurate evapotranspiration estimations in arid and semi-arid regions are important for monitoring droughts and protecting the ecological environment. The main objective of this study is to build an evapotranspiration estimation model suitable for an effective scientific and objective evaluation of water consumption in the arid and semi-arid regions of the Xilin River Basin based on comprehensive parameters, including meteorological parameters, vegetation coverage, and soil water content. In this study, the community evapotranspiration model was initially constructed using field data, which was then expanded for applicability to the Xilin River Basin based on Geographic Information System technology and spatial heterogeneity characteristics of remote sensing data; both models were significant at the 0.05 level. The monthly evapotranspiration values in July during 2000-2017 and those from April to September (growing season) during the dry, normal, and wet years were calculated using the model at the basin scale. The evapotranspiration showed a generally increasing trend, which was consistent with the fluctuation trend in precipitation in July during 2000-2017. The trend curve for evapotranspiration was gentle during the growing season in dry years, but steep during wet years. The evapotranspiration was the lowest in April, with negligible spatial variations throughout the Xilin River Basin. During May-July, the evapotranspiration was higher than that in other months, in the following order: upper reaches > middle reaches > lower reaches; this was consistent with the vegetation coverage. The evapotranspiration declined and spatial variations were not evident during August-September. The results of this study provide a reference for evapotranspiration model construction and a scientific basis for evaluating regional water resources and protecting the ecological environment."
https://openalex.org/W3198494781,"Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is one of the primary causes of death of infants in the first year of life. According to the WHO’s data, the global infant mortality rate is 0.64–2 per 1,000 live-born children. Molecular and cellular aspects of SIDS development have not been identified so far. The purpose of this paper is to verify and analyze the expression of melatonin 1 and 2 receptors, serotonin (as a melatonin precursor), and CD34 molecules (as hematopoietic and endothelial markers of cardiovascular damage) in the medulla, heart, and aorta in infants who died from SIDS. An immunohistochemical method was used to investigate samples of medulla, heart, and aorta tissues of infants 3 to 9 months of age who died from SIDS. The control group included children who died from accidents. It has been shown that the expression of melatonin receptors as well as serotonin and CD34 angiogenesis markers in tissues of the medulla, heart, and aorta of infants who died from SIDS is statistically lower as compared with their expression in the same tissues in children who died from accidents. The obtained data help to clarify in detail the role of melatonin and such signaling molecules as serotonin and CD34 in SIDS pathogenesis, which can open new prospects for devising novel methods for predictive diagnosis of development and targeted prophylaxis of SIDS."

This study assessed the relationship between employment rate and weight loss, deprivation, and Bariatric Analysis and Reporting Outcome System (BAROS) scores after bariatric surgery in a deprived area. This retrospective study evaluated the employment rate at a mean period of 2.3±0.1 years after bariatric surgery among 133 individuals. The Evaluation of Deprivation and Inequalities in Health Examination Centers (EPICES score), satisfaction scale, and BAROS (self-esteem, physical activity, social life, work conditions, and sexual activity) questionnaires were used. The mean age of the participants was 45 (range: 19-67) years. Approximately 88% were women. The initial mean body mass index (BMI) was 42.7 kg/m2, and about 88% of the participants underwent sleeve gastrectomy. The mean decrease in BMI was 12 ± 0.5 kg/m2. The mean EPICES score (N<30), BAROS, and satisfaction scale (range: 1-5) scores were 31.9±18, 1.3±1.1, and 4.27±1.19, respectively. After surgery, 19 participants obtained a job. However, three were unemployed. Based on a multivariate analysis, employed and unemployed participants (77 vs 52) before surgery had a lower initial BMI and better BAROS and satisfaction scale scores. After surgery, there was no difference between participants who obtained a new job and those still did not have a job in terms of questionnaire responses. Obtaining a new job was not associated with BMI, sex, or age differences. However, there was a positive correlation between social life score and weight loss. Bariatric surgery increased an individual's chance of finding a job independently of deprivation status. Participants with a pre-operative job had a better perception of satisfaction and BAROS scores. Moreover, social isolation was correlated with unsuccessful weight loss."
https://openalex.org/W3025140065,"Background Parental misperception and underestimation of their child’s weight are documented in studies. Demographic factors like age and gender have been linked to misclassification. However, modifiable factors that could potentially frame future intervention and prevention strategies have not been explored. This study aimed to assess factors that could predict parental misclassification of their preschool child’s weight. Methods This was a cross-sectional study with 198 parents and their 2- to 5-year-old children who attended standalone preschools or childcare centers with preschools. Parents completed a questionnaire that asked about demographic features, personal and family health, and the assessment of their child’s weight using the three most frequently utilized measures. Logistic regression was conducted to assess the association between parental factors and child weight classification status. Instruments included the Parental Self-Efficacy for Promoting Healthy Physical Activity and Dietary Behaviors in Children Scale (PSEPAD), the Obesity Risk Scale (ORK-10), and the Adolescent Obesity Risk Scale (AORK). Analyses included frequencies, chi-square tests, Kappa coefficients, and logistic regressions. Results Parents were least accurate (35.9%) identifying child weight when selecting a picture (κ = -.028, p = .42). The pictorial and Likert method (κ = -.032, p = .37) showed parental agreement with child weight was not significantly better than chance. Statistically, a significant agreement was found in the weight-reporting method (κ = .21). Two of the three HBM-related measures were significantly related to accurate classification. Logistic regression showed child sex, PSEPAD scores, and ORK-10 scores were statistically significant predictors in the Likert method. The model had no statistical significance for the pictorial or weight-reporting method. Conclusion Results indicate parents support intervening if aware of child weight problems. However, parents do not accurately recognize healthy versus unhealthy weights and report that health providers are not informing them of weight deviations. Further, important relationships between the HBM variables were identified. Results show barriers (self-efficacy) mediate the impact of perceived severity (knowledge) regarding the parental ability to assess child weight accurately. These relationships and incorporation of the HBM principles of barriers and severity into prevention/intervention strategies need further exploration."
https://openalex.org/W3198677157,"More than 300 genetic risk loci have been identified for male pattern baldness (MPB) but little is known about the exact molecular mechanisms through which the associated variants exert their effects on MPB pathophysiology. Here, we aimed at further elucidating the regulatory architecture of the MPB risk locus on chromosome (chr.) 2q35, where we have previously reported a regulatory effect of the MPB lead variant on the expression of WNT10A. A HaploReg database research for regulatory annotations revealed that the association signal at 2q35 maps to a binding site for the transcription factor EBF1, whose gene is located at a second MPB risk locus on chr. 5q33.3. To investigate a potential interaction between EBF1 and WNT10A during MPB development, we performed in vitro luciferase reporter assays as well as expression analyses and immunofluorescence co-stainings in microdissected human hair follicles. Our experiments confirm that EBF1 activates the WNT10A promoter and that the WNT10A/EBF1 interaction is impacted by the allelic expression of the MPB risk allele at 2q35. Expression analyses across different hair cycle phases and immunhistochemical (co)stainings against WNT10A and EBF1 suggest a predominant relevance of EBF1/WNT10A interaction for hair shaft formation during anagen. Based on these findings we suggest a functional mechanism at the 2q35 risk locus for MPB, where an MPB-risk allele associated reduction in WNT10A promoter activation via EBF1 results in a decrease in WNT10A expression that eventually results in anagen shortening, that is frequently observed in MPB affected hair follicles. To our knowledge, this study is the first follow-up study on MPB that proves functional interaction between two MPB risk loci and sheds light on the underlying pathophysiological mechanism at these loci."

Samples were enriched for MeV using filtration or nucleases and the minimal number of sequence reads to allocate per sample based on its MeV content was assessed using in-silico reduction of sequencing depth. Application of limited-resource sequencing to treated MeV-positive samples demonstrated that 1-5 million sequences for samples with high/medium MeV quantities and 10-15 million sequences for samples with lower MeV quantities are sufficient to obtain >98% MeV genome coverage and over X50 average depth. This approach enables real-time high-resolution molecular epidemiological investigations of large-scale MeV outbreaks."

To date, no incremental badminton field test has been developed that can be easily used by badminton coaches that requires accessible material for anyone. Objectives The purpose of this study was to develop a practical and reliable easy-to use intermittent endurance badminton test for estimating maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2max ). Methods Thirty six Spanish badminton players (age: 24.1±10.3 years) performed, on different days of the same week, four incremental protocols to exhaustion in randomized order: a treadmill incremental test, a Yo-Yo intermittent recovery level 1 test (Yo-Yo IR1) and twice the Abian intermittent recovery badminton test (AIR-BT). Oxygen uptake was determined with a breath-by-breath gas analyzer during the incremental treadmill test, and performance in the Yo-yo IR1 and AIR-BT was recorded. Results Significant correlations (p&lt;0.001) for Pearson’s product moment coefficient were found between the performance in the AIR-BT and the two non-specific incremental tests (VO 2max in the Treadmill Test: r = 0.87, distance in the Yo-Yo IR1: r = 0.86). The regression equation to calculate the VO 2max from the AIR-BT time [VO 2max = 0.023*(AIR-BT time in seconds)+31.334] showed an adjusted R 2 of 0.76 and a SEE of 3.34 ml·kg -1 ·min -1 . There was no significant difference between VO 2max obtained by the incremental treadmill test and VO 2max calculated using the regression equation (p = 0.644). A paired t-test reported no significant differences between day 1 and day 2 in the AIR-BT time (p = 0.753), the Pearson correlation coefficient between both days was: r = 0.88 (p&lt;0.001) and the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.875. Conclusions The AIR-BT is a valid and reliable on-court test for assessing VO 2max in badminton players and may be utilized by coaches and physical trainers for cross-sectional comparison of players and for evaluation of longitudinal changes."
https://openalex.org/W3130049521,"Screening plans for prevention and containment of SARS-CoV-2 infection should take into account the epidemic context, the fact that undetected infected individuals may transmit the disease and that the infection spreads through outbreaks, creating clusters in the population. In this paper, we compare through simulations the performance of six screening plans based on poorly sensitive individual tests, in detecting infection outbreaks at the level of single classes in a typical European school context. The performance evaluation is done by simulating different epidemic dynamics within the class during the four weeks following the day of the initial infection. The plans have different costs in terms of number of individual tests required for the screening and are based on recurrent evaluations on all students or subgroups of students in rotation. Especially in scenarios where the rate of contagion is high, at an equal cost, testing half of the class in rotation every week appears to be better in terms of sensitivity than testing all students every two weeks. Similarly, testing one-fourth of the students every week is comparable with testing all students every two weeks, despite the first one is a much cheaper strategy. In conclusion, we show that in the presence of natural clusters in the population, testing subgroups of individuals belonging to the same cluster in rotation may have a better performance than testing all the individuals less frequently. The proposed simulations approach can be extended to evaluate more complex screening plans than those presented in the paper."

In Mexico, there are no national, state, nor municipal estimates that inform the country's situation over time. The purpose of this study was to estimate the incidence of LBW at the national, state, and municipal levels from 2008 to 2017, and to estimate the LBW incidence based on maternal sociodemographic characteristics, prenatal care and marginalization indexes at the national level using open national data. We used spatial data analysis to georeferenced LBW incidence at the three levels of geographical disaggregation studied. At the national level, the incidence of LBW increased progressively from 6.2% (2008) to 7.1% (2017), and the country's capital represented the area with the highest incidence. Southeastern and central states reported the highest LBW regional incidence. At the municipal level, the number of municipalities with an incidence of LBW ≥8% increased in both male and female newborns. The incidence of LBW was higher as the marginalization indexes increases.

Logistic regression model was used to estimate relations between adiposity change and HBP risk with adjustment of covariates. A total of 28,288 children (median of baseline age:10 years) were involved with follow-up of 6.88±1.20 months. After the follow-up, 9.4% of the children had persistent general obesity (GOB), 2.8% converted from GOB to non-GOB, 0.9% had newly developed GOB. When compared with children remained non-GOB, children with continuous GOB status, newly developed GOB, converting from GOB to non-GOB had 5.03-fold (95%CI: 4.32~5.86), 3.35-fold (95%CI: 1.99~5.65), 2.72-fold (2.03~3.63) HBP risk, respectively. Similar findings were observed for abdominal obesity (AOB). Reduction of 0.21–0.88 kg/m 2 of baseline BMI (0.86–3.59%) or 0.009–0.024 of baseline WHtR (1.66–4.42%) in GOB or AOB children, respectively, was associated with significant decrease in HBP risk. Children with persistent obesity, newly developed obesity, or converting from obese to non-obese had significantly higher HBP risk. For children with GOB or AOB, reduction of &lt;3.6% in BMI or &lt;4.5% in WHtR could decrease the HBP risk."

Uric acids disorders in particular hyperuricemia are significant problems in essential hypertensive patients and can cause substantial morbidity and mortality. Determination of uric acid disorders may play a major role in the management and early aversion of complications in hypertensive patient. Therefore, this study aimed to determine uric acid disorders and associated factors among essential hypertensive adults in the outpatient department at Wolkite University specialized Hospital, Southern Ethiopia from November 1 to February 30, 2021.An institional based cross sectional study was conducted on 270 essential hypertensive adults on follow-up in outpatient department from November 1 to February 30, 2021. Structured questionnaires through face to face interviews and participants' medical records were used to collect information on determinants related with uric acid disorders. The blood specimen was collected and level of serum uric acid, blood sugar and lipid profile was measured using standard principles and procedures with an ABX Pentra 400 automated chemistry analyzer. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were done to identify factors associated with hyperuricemia. The p-value was set at <0.05 with a 95% confidence interval of the adjusted odds ratio.A total of 270 adult essential hypertensive patients were participated in the study, among those 196(27.4%) of study participants were hyperuricemic with 95%CI (21.9, 33.3). Being alcoholic [(AOR: 15.68, 95% CI: (5.93, 21.41)], taking antihypertensive medication [(AOR: 11.56, 95% CI: (3.94, 23.80)], BMI > = 30 [(AOR: 4.89, 95% CI: (1.46, 25.5)] and being centrally obese [(AOR: 6.87, 95% CI: (2.53, 18.63)] were factors significantly associated with hyperuricemia.In this study, the high burden of hyperuricemia (27.4%) was observed in essential hypertensive patients with follow-up in outpatient department. Taking alcohol and antihypertensive medication, being overweight and centrally obese were identified factors of uric acid disorders. The finding of this study should be taken into consideration to implement preventive interventions on identified predictors in hypertensive patients. Taking fruit and vegetable, and promoting physical exercise and determinations of serum uric acid level in adult essential hypertensive patients was recommended to minimize the emergence of hyperuricemia."
https://openalex.org/W3198509281,"Pine wilt disease (PWD) is a devastating disease affecting trees belonging to the genus Pinus. To control the spread of PWD in the Masson pine forest in China, PWD resistant Masson pine clones have been selected by the Anhui Academy of Forestry. However, because Masson pine is a difficult-to-root species, producing seedlings is challenging, especially from trees older than 5 years of age, which impedes the application of PWD resistant clones. In this study, we investigated the factors affecting rooting of PWD resistant clones and established a cheap, reliable, and simple method that promotes rooting. We tested the effects of three management methods, four substrates, two cutting materials, two cutting treatments, and three collection times on the rooting of cuttings obtained from 9-year-old PWD resistant clones. Rooting was observed only in stem cuttings treated with the full-light automatic spray management method. Additionally, stem cuttings showed a significantly higher rooting rate and root quality than needles cuttings. Compared with other substrates, stem cuttings planted in perlite produced the longest adventitious root and the highest total root length and lateral root number. Moreover, stem cuttings of PWD resistant clones collected in May showed a significantly higher rooting rate and root quality than those collected in June and July. Moreover, stem cuttings prepared with a horizontal cut while retaining the needles showed significantly higher rooting rate and root quality than those prepared with a diagonal cut while partly removing the needles. This study promotes the reproduction of seedlings of PWD-resistant Masson pine clones which helps control the spread of PWD, meanwhile, provides a technical reference for the propagation of mature pine trees via cuttings."
https://openalex.org/W3196627210,"Much of the current research on supervised modelling is focused on maximizing outcome prediction accuracy. However, in engineering disciplines, an arguably more important goal is that of feature extraction, the identification of relevant features associated with the various outcomes. For instance, in microbial communities, the identification of keystone species can often lead to improved prediction of future behavioral shifts. This paper proposes a novel feature extractor based on Deep Learning, which is largely agnostic to underlying assumptions regarding the training data. Starting from a collection of microbial species abundance counts, the Deep Learning model first trains itself to classify the selected distinct habitats. It then identifies indicator species associated with the habitats. The results are then compared and contrasted with those obtained by traditional statistical techniques. The indicator species are similar when compared at top taxonomic levels such as Domain and Phylum, despite visible differences in lower levels such as Class and Order. More importantly, when our estimated indicators are used to predict final habitat labels using simpler models (such as Support Vector Machines and traditional Artificial Neural Networks), the prediction accuracy is improved. Overall, this study serves as a preliminary step that bridges modern, black-box Machine Learning models with traditional, domain expertise-rich techniques."
https://openalex.org/W3196671401,"The reduced specificity of positive and negative autobiographical memories observed in anorexic (AN) patients may reflect a global disturbance in their emotional information processing. However, their emotional difficulties may differ according to the subtype of AN, implying possible differences in the manifestation of autobiographical memory impairments. The aims of the study were (1) to confirm the autobiographical memory deficits in AN patients in terms of specificity and wealth of memories, and (2) to compare autobiographical deficits according to the AN subtype: restrictive type (AR) or binge/purging type (AB). Ninety-five non-clinical (NC) individuals and 95 AN patients including 69 AR and 22 AB patients were administered the Williams' and Scott's Autobiographical Memory Test. The results confirmed a lack of specificity regardless of emotional valence in the overall AN patient group without any distinction of subtype, which was linked to the number of hospitalizations. When the AN subtype was considered, AR patients demonstrated reduced specificity for negative memories only, suggesting differences in emotional functioning or in the mechanisms underlying reduced specificity between AR and AB patients. Furthermore, the overall AN group demonstrated lower variability and complexity in their memory content than the NC group. However, this difference in the complexity of recalled memories was only found in response to negative cues. When AN subtypes were considered, AR patients showed fewer complex memories than NC individuals. Beyond a reduced specificity, AN patients also depict a poverty in the range of event recall and a difficulty in developing narrative content. The clinical implications of such autobiographical memory deficits need to be further investigated."
https://openalex.org/W3197189001,"Heightened immigration enforcement may induce fear in undocumented patients when coming to the Emergency Department (ED) for care. Limited literature examining health system policies to reduce immigrant fear exists. In this multi-site qualitative study, we sought to assess provider and system-level policies on caring for undocumented patients in three California EDs.We recruited 41 ED providers and administrators from three California EDs (in San Francisco, Oakland, and Sylmar) with large immigrant populations. Participants were recruited using a trusted gatekeeper and snowball sampling. We conducted semi-structured interviews and analyzed the transcripts using constructivist grounded theory.We interviewed 10 physicians, 11 nurses, 9 social workers, and 11 administrators, and identified 7 themes. Providers described existing policies and recent policy changes that facilitate access to care for undocumented patients. Providers reported that current training and communication around policies is limited, there are variations between who asks about and documents status, and there remains uncertainty around policy details, laws, and jurisdiction of staff. Providers also stated they are taking an active role in building safety and trust and see their role as supporting undocumented patients.This study introduces ED-level health system perspectives and recommendations for caring for undocumented patients. There is a need for active, multi-disciplinary ED policy training, clear policy details including the extent of providers' roles, protocols on the screening and documentation of status, and continual reassessment of our health systems to reduce fear and build safety and trust with our undocumented communities."
https://openalex.org/W3197492621,"Water and land resource utilization is an important driving force of changes in ecosystem services; therefore, research on multi-parameter coupling systems that consider “ecosystem services, water resources, and land resources” together has key significance for river basins. This study aims to reveal the interaction and mutual influence of ecosystem services and water and land resources in the Daguhe River Basin, China, based on the coupling coordination degree model. The results showed that during the period from 2000 to 2010, the coupling coordination degree values for the years 2000, 2005, and 2010 were 0.6005, 0.7292, and 0.8037. The corresponding coupling coordination classifications were categorized as “primary coordinated development”, “intermediate coordinated development,” and “well-coordinated development”, respectively. These results reflected the fact that the relationship between water and land resource utilization and the environment tends to evolve in the direction of coordinated development (an improvement in one part corresponds to an improvement in another part) with variation in water and land utilization types, and eventually pushes the whole resource, as well as ecological and environmental systems, from low to high levels of coupling coordination degrees as observed in case of the Daguhe River Basin, China. Our research provides an overview of the interaction between ecosystem services and water and land resources in the Daguhe Basin and even in the Shandong Province. With our results, we offer new perspectives on river basin management and for planning future eco-environmental policies (the policy is specifically designed for the ecological environment) by combining water and land resource utilization."
https://openalex.org/W3198068476,"Background Detailed longitudinal studies of HIV-positive individuals in West Africa are lacking. Here the HIV prevalence, incidence, all-cause mortality, and the proportion of individuals receiving treatment with cART in two cohorts of participants in Ebola-related studies are described. Setting Individuals of all ages were enrolled and followed at four sites in the area of Monrovia, Liberia. Methods Two cohorts identified in response to the Ebola epidemic are described to provide insights into the current state of the HIV epidemic. HIV testing was performed at baseline for participants in both cohorts and during follow-up in one cohort. Results Prevalence and incidence of HIV (prevalence of 3.1% for women and 1.4% for men and incidence of 3.3 per 1,000) were higher in these cohorts compared to 2018 national estimates (prevalence of 1.3% and incidence of 0.39 per 1,000). Most participants testing positive did not know their status prior to testing. Of those who knew they were HIV positive, 7.9% reported being on antiretroviral treatment. The death rate among those with HIV was 12.3% compared to 1.9% in HIV-negative individuals (adjusted odds ratio of 6.87). While higher levels of d-dimer were associated with increased mortality, this was not specific to those with HIV, however lower hemoglobin levels were associated with increased mortality among those with HIV. Conclusion These findings point to a need to perform further research studies aimed at fulfilling these knowledge gaps and address current shortcomings in the provision of care for those living with HIV in Liberia."
https://openalex.org/W3198435710,"Neurodegenerative disease (ND) is a growing health burden worldwide, but its causes and treatments remain elusive. Although most cases of ND are sporadic, rare familial cases have been attributed to single genes, which can be investigated in animal models. We have generated a new mutation in the calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) VIA gene CG6718, the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of human PLA2G6/PARK14, mutations in which cause a suite of NDs collectively called PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN). Our mutants display age-related loss of climbing ability, a symptom of neurodegeneration in flies. Although phospholipase activity commonly is presumed to underlie iPLA2-VIA function, locomotor decline in our mutants is rescued by a transgene carrying a serine-to-alanine mutation in the catalytic residue, suggesting that important functional aspects are independent of phospholipase activity. Additionally, we find that iPLA2-VIA knockdown in either muscle or neurons phenocopies locomotor decline with age, demonstrating its necessity in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues. Furthermore, RNA in situ hybridization shows high endogenous iPLA2-VIA mRNA expression in adult germ cells, and transgenic HA-tagged iPLA2-VIA colocalizes with mitochondria there. Mutant males are fertile with normal spermatogenesis, while fertility is reduced in mutant females. Mutant female germ cells display age-related mitochondrial aggregation, loss of mitochondrial potential, and elevated cell death. These results suggest that iPLA2-VIA is critical for mitochondrial integrity in the Drosophila female germline, which may provide a novel context to investigate its functions with parallels to PLAN."
https://openalex.org/W3198492490,"The vast majority of testing procedures presented in the literature as goodness-of-fit tests fail to accomplish what the term is promising. Actually, a significant result of such a test indicates that the true distribution underlying the data differs substantially from the assumed model, whereas the true objective is usually to establish that the model fits the data sufficiently well. Meeting that objective requires to carry out a testing procedure for a problem in which the statement that the deviations between model and true distribution are small, plays the role of the alternative hypothesis. Testing procedures of this kind, for which the term tests for equivalence has been coined in statistical usage, are available for establishing goodness-of-fit of discrete distributions. We show how this methodology can be extended to settings where interest is in establishing goodness-of-fit of distributions of the continuous type."
https://openalex.org/W3198661372,"The optimal salvage treatment strategies for lymph node-positive (LNP) patients after radical surgery have not been clearly defined in prostate cancer with biochemical recurrence or persistence of elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In this study, we compared the clinical outcomes of two different salvage treatments, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) alone versus ADT with radiotherapy (RT). We also investigated prognostic factors that could support the use of ADT with RT in LNP prostate cancer.We retrospectively reviewed 94 LNP prostate cancer patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) followed by salvage treatment between 2004 and 2018. Salvage treatments involved either ADT alone or ADT with RT according to the clinical judgment of the physician. We analyzed clinicopathological and treatment factors related to 2nd biochemical failure (2nd BCF), clinical progression (CP), and progression-free survival (PFS). The cumulative failure after salvage treatment was defined as including both 2nd BCF and CP.The median duration of follow-up was 55 months (interquartile range, 35-97 months). Thirty-seven (39.4%) patients were treated with ADT alone, and 57 patients (60.6%) were treated with a combination of ADT with RT. During follow-up period, the incidence of failure after salvage treatment in the ADT alone group and the combined treatment group was 89.2% and 45.6%, respectively (HR, 22.4; 95% CI 5.43-92.1; P < 0.001). The combination of ADT with RT was associated with better 2nd BCF and PFS than ADT alone (P = 0.007 and P = 0.015, respectively). In multivariate analyses, number of positive LN ≥ 2 and PSA nadir ≥ 0.005 ng/ml after RP were associated with poor 2nd BCF, CP, and PFS after salvage treatment. Salvage by combined ADT plus RT showed better 2nd BCF and PFS than ADT alone. Specifically, patients with number of positive LN ≥ 2 or PSA nadir ≥ 0.005 ng/ml after RP showed better 2nd BCF (P = 0.004) or PFS (P = 0.011) when treated with ADT plus RT rather than ADT alone.In patients with LNP prostate cancer, salvage ADT plus RT improved 2nd BCF and PFS compared to ADT alone. In particular, when the patients had more than two positive lymph nodes or PSA nadir ≥ 0.005 ng/ml after RP, ADT with RT seems to be a more beneficial salvage treatment resulting in better 2nd BCF and PFS."
