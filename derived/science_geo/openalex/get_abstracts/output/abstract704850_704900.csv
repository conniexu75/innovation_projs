https://openalex.org/W4307646630,"Lysosomes are one of the major centers for regulating cargo degradation and protein quality control. Transcription factor EB (TFEB)-promoted lysosome biogenesis enhances lysosome-mediated degradation and alleviates neurodegenerative diseases, but the mechanisms underlying TFEB modification and activation are still poorly understood. Here, we report essential roles of TFEB acetylation in TFEB nuclear translocation and lysosome biogenesis, which are independent of TFEB dephosphorylation. By screening small molecules, we find that Trichostatin A (TSA), the pan-inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs), promotes nuclear translocation of TFEB. TSA enhances the staining of cells by LysoTracker Red and increases the expression of lysosomal and autophagic genes. We identify four novel acetylated lysine residues in TFEB, which are important for TFEB nuclear translocation and lysosome biogenesis. We show that TFEB acetylation is regulated by HDACs (HDAC5, HDAC6, and HDAC9) and lysine acetyltransferases (KATs), including ELP3, CREBBP, and HAT1. During TSA-induced cytosol-to-nucleus translocation of TFEB, acetylation is independent of TFEB dephosphorylation, since the mTORC1- or GSK3β-related phosphorylation sites on TFEB are still phosphorylated. Administration of TSA to APP/PS1 mice increases the expression of lysosomal and autophagic genes in mouse brains and also improves memory. Accordingly, the β-amyloid plaque burden is decreased. These results show that the acetylation of TFEB, as a novel mechanism of TFEB activation, promotes lysosome biogenesis and alleviates the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Our results also suggest that HDAC inhibition can promote lysosome biogenesis, and this may be a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and disorders related to HDAC hyperactivation."
https://openalex.org/W4310095994,"The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 is one of the optimum targets for antiviral drug design and development. The hydroxyl groups of cytidine structures were modified with different aliphatic and aromatic groups to obtain 5´-O-acyl and 2´,3´-di-O-acyl derivatives, and then, these derivatives were employed in molecular modeling, antiviral prediction, molecular docking, molecular dynamics, pharmacological and POM studies. Density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G++ level analyzed biochemical behavior and molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) of the modified cytidine derivatives. The antiviral parameters of the mutated derivatives revealed promising drug properties compared with those of standard antiviral drugs. Molecular docking has determined binding affinities and interactions between the cytidine derivatives and SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The modified derivatives strongly interacted with prime Pro620 and Lys621 residues. The binding conformation and interactions stability were investigated by 200 ns of molecular dynamics simulations and predicted the compounds to firmly dock inside the RdRp binding pocket. Interestingly, the binding residues of the derivatives were revealed in high equilibrium showing an enhanced binding affinity for the molecules. Intermolecular interactions are dominated by both Van der Waals and electrostatic energies. Finally, the pharmacokinetic characterization of the optimized inhibitors confirmed the safety of derivatives due to their improved kinetic properties. The selected cytidine derivatives can be suggested as potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2. The POM Theory supports the hypothesis above by confirming the existence of an antiviral (Oδ--O'δ-) pharmacophore site of Hits."
https://openalex.org/W4310092913,"Rotenone is a commonly used insecticidal chemical in agriculture and it is an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex Ⅰ. Previous studies have found that rotenone induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by inhibiting electron transport in the mitochondria of somatic and germ cells. However, there is little precise information on the effects of rotenone exposure in porcine oocytes during in vitro maturation, and the mechanisms underlying these effects have not been determined. The Cumulus-oocyte complexes were supplemented with different concentrations of rotenone to elucidate the effects of rotenone exposure on the meiotic maturation of porcine oocytes during in vitro maturation for about 48 hours. First, we found that the maturation rate and expansion of cumulus cells were significantly reduced in the 3 and 5 μM rotenone-treated groups. Subsequently, the concentration of rotenone was determined to be 3 μM. Also, immunofluorescence, western blotting, and image quantification analyses were performed to test the rotenone exposure on the meiotic maturation, total and mitochondrial ROS, mitochondrial function and biogenesis, mitophagy and apoptosis in porcine oocytes. Further experiments showed that rotenone treatment induced mitochondrial dysfunction and failure of mitochondrial biogenesis by repressing the level of SIRT1 during in vitro maturation of porcine oocytes. In addition, rotenone treatment reduced the ratio of active mitochondria to total mitochondria, increased ROS production, and decreased ATP production. The levels of LC3 and active-caspase 3 were significantly increased by rotenone treatment, indicating that mitochondrial dysfunction induced by rotenone increased mitophagy but eventually led to apoptosis. Collectively, these results suggest that rotenone interferes with porcine oocyte maturation by inhibiting mitochondrial function."
https://openalex.org/W4310150472,"The number of new cases of cancer is increasing each year, and rates of diabetes mellitus are also increasing dramatically over time. It is not an unusual occurrence for an individual to have both cancer and diabetes at the same time, given they are both individually common, and that one condition can increase the risk of the other. In this manuscript, we use national-level diabetes (Virtual Diabetes Register) and cancer (New Zealand Cancer Registry) data on nearly five million individuals over 44 million person-years of follow-up to examine the occurrence of cancer amongst a national prevalent cohort of patients with diabetes. We completed this analysis separately by cancer for the 24 most commonly diagnosed cancers in Aotearoa New Zealand, and then compared the occurrence of cancer among those with diabetes to those without diabetes. We found that the rate of cancer was highest amongst those with diabetes for 21 of the 24 most common cancers diagnosed over our study period, with excess risk among those with diabetes ranging between 11% (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) and 236% (liver cancer). The cancers with the greatest difference in incidence between those with diabetes and those without diabetes tended to be within the endocrine or gastrointestinal system, and/or had a strong relationship with obesity. However, in an absolute sense, due to the volume of breast, colorectal and lung cancers, prevention of the more modest excess cancer risk among those with diabetes (16%, 22% and 48%, respectively) would lead to a substantial overall reduction in the total burden of cancer in the population. Our findings reinforce the fact that diabetes prevention activities are also cancer prevention activities, and must therefore be prioritised and resourced in tandem."
https://openalex.org/W4309900091,"We show that T7 DNA polymerase (pol) and exonuclease (exo) domains contribute to selective error correction during DNA replication by regulating bidirectional strand transfer between the two active sites. To explore the kinetic basis for selective removal of mismatches, we used a fluorescent cytosine analog (1,3-diaza-2-oxophenoxazine) to monitor the kinetics of DNA transfer between the exo and pol sites. We globally fit stopped-flow fluorescence and base excision kinetic data and compared results obtained with ssDNA versus duplex DNA to resolve how DNA transfer governs exo specificity. We performed parallel studies using hydrolysis-resistant phosphorothioate oligonucleotides to monitor DNA transfer to the exo site without hydrolysis. ssDNA binds to the exo site at the diffusion limit (109 M-1 s-1, Kd = 40 nM) followed by fast hydrolysis of the 3'-terminal nucleotide (>5000 s-1). Analysis using duplex DNA with a 3'-terminal mismatch or a buried mismatch exposed a unique intermediate state between pol and exo active sites and revealed that transfer via the intermediate to the exo site is stimulated by free nucleoside triphosphates. Transfer from the exo site back to the pol site after cleavage is fast and efficient. We propose a model to explain why buried mismatches are removed faster than single 3'-terminal mismatches and thereby provide an additional opportunity for error correction. Our data provide the first comprehensive model to explain how DNA transfer from pol to exo active sites and back again after base excision allow efficient selective mismatch removal during DNA replication to improve fidelity by more than 1000-fold."
https://openalex.org/W4310092902,"Background This study aimed to analyse the content of the Dental Benefits Act 2008 as a foundation for the Child Dental Benefits Schedule (CDBS) to determine how the Act encourages Australian families to seek and utilise oral health services. Methods This was a qualitative narrative document analysis conducted in 2022. Data was collected by searching formal websites for retrieving documents that reported the Australian Dental Benefits Act. The eligibility of the retrieved documents was assessed based on authenticity, credibility, representativeness, and meaningfulness of the data. A seven-steps procedure was applied for framework analysis. Results The content of the Dental Benefits Act 2008 provides directions on the three categories of operational, collective, and constitutional rules. Operational rules at the level of oral health providers and the population, as the service end users, can be demonstrated as rules in use in a mutual interaction with the collective and constitutional rules. The consequence of governing the rules at the community level can easily define how the oral health services are provided and utilised. The response is sent to the government level for better regulation of oral health service delivery and utilisation. Then, with interaction and advocacy with the diverse range of stakeholders and interdisciplinary partnerships, with community groups, non-government sectors and councils, the rules can be transformed, adopted, monitored, and enforced. Another mechanism of response has occurred at the providers’ and users’ level and to the operational rules to community groups and stakeholders via advertising and promoting the utilisation and provision of oral health services. Conclusion This study integrates the perspective of politicians with those of policy makers to reconsider the role and significance of the rules based on the triple collaborations among oral health users and oral service providers, the community, and the stakeholders as well as the government. A comprehensive attention is still needed in future revisions of the Dental Benefits Act 2008 according to the contextual factors, socioeconomic and geographical attributes of the population for better implementation of de facto rules and more effective outcomes of the interventions. It is recommended that further research be undertaken utilising a mix-method approach for a holistic view prior to further revisions of the Act or proposal of probable upcoming schemes."
https://openalex.org/W4310095977,"Due to the conflict between reducing cost and improving water supply performance, how to select the appropriate pipe diameter is a current challenge. In this paper, the problem is transformed into a multi-objective optimization problem, and the evolutionary genetic optimization algorithm is used to solve the problem to determine the optimal selection of pipe diameter in the pipe network. To solve this problem, the evolutionary genetic algorithm was coupled with EPANET hydraulic simulation software in Python environment. The results show that NSGA-II and NSGA-III perform better in two typical case tests. Moreover, the increase of the objective functions will lead to an increase in the amount of data in the optimal solution set, and will affect the optimal value of each objective function. That shows that the balance between the economy and reliability of water supply can be successfully found by coupling the hydraulic model and the multi-objective optimization algorithm, which can provide an auxiliary decision for enterprises."
https://openalex.org/W4307723480,"Pyruvate has two major fates upon entry into mitochondria, the oxidative decarboxylation to acetyl-CoA via the pyruvate decarboxylase complex or the biotin-dependent carboxylation to oxaloacetate via pyruvate carboxylase (Pcx). Here, we have generated mice with a liver-specific KO of pyruvate carboxylase (PcxL-/-) to understand the role of Pcx in hepatic mitochondrial metabolism under disparate physiological states. PcxL-/- mice exhibited a deficit in hepatic gluconeogenesis and enhanced ketogenesis as expected but were able to maintain systemic euglycemia following a 24 h fast. Feeding a high-fat diet to PcxL-/- mice resulted in animals that were resistant to glucose intolerance without affecting body weight. However, we found that PcxL-/- mice fed a ketogenic diet for 1 week became severely hypoglycemic, demonstrating a requirement for hepatic Pcx for long-term glycemia under carbohydrate-limited diets. Additionally, we determined that loss of Pcx was associated with an induction in the abundance of lysine-acetylated proteins in PcxL-/- mice regardless of physiologic state. Furthermore, liver acetyl-proteomics revealed a biased induction in mitochondrial lysine-acetylated proteins. These data show that Pcx is important for maintaining the proper balance of pyruvate metabolism between oxidative and anaplerotic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W4310092911,"The use of starch, a natural polymeric material, and derivatives thereof is based on its adhesive, thickening, gelling, swelling, and film-forming properties, as well as its ready availability. The objective of this research work is to develop an effective propylated Dioscorea abyssinica starch (PDAS) as a hydrophobic excipient for pharmaceutical applications with a reasonable price. This paper reports on the synthesis, characterization, and in vivo safety evaluation of PDAS. Native Dioscorea abyssinica starch (NDAS) was modified to its propylated form with propionic anhydride and characterized. Crystallinity, morphological structure, thermal behavior, solubility, and safety of PDAS were evaluated using x-ray diffraction, SEM, thermogravimetric, gravimetric, and toxicity studies, respectively. Propionyl content and degree of substitution (DS) of starch increased significantly (p < 0.05) with an increase in reaction time and temperature. Propionyl content and DS of starch increased significantly (p < 0.05) with a decrease in the ratio of starch to pyridine and starch to propionic anhydride in the reaction medium. FTIR spectra of PDAS indicated that hydroxyl groups participated in the propylation reaction. X-ray diffraction results showed that the chemical modification destroyed the crystalline structure of the NDAS. SEM of NDAS showed a rounded shape which became irregular after propylation. Thermogravimetric curves revealed that all the PDAS samples decomposed at higher temperatures than their native counterparts. At higher DS, swelling power and solubility in an aqueous environment significantly (p < 0.05) decreased below that of the native starch. PDAS with high DS, were soluble in organic solvents at room temperature. But PDAS with lower DS didn't dissolve in all types of organic solvents used. PDAS (DS = 2.842) in distilled water did not produce adverse effects in rats. Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that PDAS can be considered as a generally safe excipient and fulfills the physicochemical properties of a hydrophobic excipient."
https://openalex.org/W4310095169,"Introduction Since the previous survey of the osteopathic profession in Austria was almost a decade ago, an update was necessary. The Osteopathic Practitioners Estimates and RAtes (OPERA) project was developed as a Europe-based survey, whereby an updated profile of the profession not only provides new data for Austria, but also allows for a clear comparison with other European countries. Methods A voluntary, online-based, closed-ended survey was distributed across Austria in the period between April and August 2020. The original English OPERA-questionnaire, composed of 52 questions in seven sections, was formally translated in German and adapted to the Austrian situation. Recruitment was performed through social-media and an e-based campaign. Results The survey was completed by 338 individuals, of which 239 (71%) were female, and the median age was 40–49 years. Almost all respondents had preliminary healthcare training, mainly in physiotherapy (72%). The majority of respondents were self-employed (88%) and working as sole practitioners (54%). The median number of consultations per week was 21–25 and the majority of respondents scheduled 46–60 minutes for each consultation (69%). The most commonly used diagnostic techniques were: palpation of position/structure, palpation of tenderness and visual inspection. The most commonly used treatment techniques were cranial, visceral and articulatory/mobilisation techniques. The majority of patients estimated by respondents consulted an osteopath for musculoskeletal complaints mainly localised in the lumbar and cervical region. Although the majority of respondents experience a strong osteopathic identity, only a small proportion (17%) advertise themselves exclusively as osteopaths. Conclusions This study represents the first published document to determine the characteristics of the osteopathic practitioners in Austria using large, national data. It provides new information on where, how, and by whom osteopathic care is delivered. The information provided may contribute to the evidence used by stakeholders and policy makers for the future regulation of the profession in Austria."
https://openalex.org/W4310095212,"Most SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) validation studies have been performed on specimens from COVID-19 patients and negative controls or from mostly symptomatic individuals. Herein we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of AFIAS COVID-19 Ag, hereinafter denominated as AFIAS, during a COVID-19 screening program surveillance testing conducted among personnel of an Italian military airport.Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) were collected from study participants and were analysed by both AFIAS and RT-PCR assay. A questionnaire collecting demographic and exposure data were administered to all participants. AFIAS accuracy parameters including Cohen's kappa (K) were determined.Overall, from November 2020 to April 2021, 1294 (NPSs) were collected from 1183 participants (88.6% males, 11.4% females; mean age were 41.3, median age 42). Forty-nine NPSs (3.78%) were positive by RT-PCR, while 54 NPSs were positive by AFIAS. Overall baseline sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 0.633, 0.981, 0.574, 0.985, respectively and K was 0.585 (moderate). AFIAS sensitivity tended to be higher for NPSs with higher viral load. A higher sensitivity (0.944) compared to the overall baseline sensitivity (0.633) was also found for NPSs from participants with COVID-19 compatible symptoms, for which K was 0.891 (almost perfect). Instead, AFIAS sensitivity was quite poor for NPSs from asymptomatic participants. Most false negative NPSs in this group had moderate viral load.Overall, AFIAS showed high specificity but only moderate sensitivity, mainly because of the high proportion of asymptomatic participants. However, AFIAS showed good sensitivity for NPSs with high viral load and nearly optimal accuracy parameters for NPSs from participants with COVID-19 compatible symptoms. Thus, taking into consideration its performance features, this test can be useful for COVID-19 case identification and management as well as for infection control."
https://openalex.org/W4310095317,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led the Canadian provincial governments to take unprecedented measures, including restrictions to healthcare services and pharmacists. Limited evidence exists on changes in prescription trends in Canada during the pandemic period.To examine the trend of prescription medications' utilization before and during COVID-19, among incident and prevalent users in the general population. We examined 18 major classes of medications.We used the administrative health databases from the province of Manitoba, Canada, to conduct a province-wide cross-sectional study. Incident and prevalent use was compared between two time periods; pre-COVID-19: July 2016-March 2020 and during COVID-19: April 2020-March 2021. Interrupted time series analysis using autoregressive models was used to quantify the change in level and slope in quarterly medication use among incident and prevalent users.The quarterly study population ranged from 1,353,485 to 1,411,630 Manitobans. The most common comorbidities were asthma (26.67%), hypertension (20.64%), and diabetes (8.31%). On average, the pandemic restrictions resulted in a 45.55% and 12.17% relative decline in the aggregated utilization of all drugs among both incident and prevalent users, respectively. Subclass analysis showed a 46.83%, 23.05%, and 30.98% relative drop among incident users of antibiotics, cardiovascular drugs and opioids use, respectively. We observed a significant slope increase during COVID-19 among the quarterly cardiovascular, antidiabetics, alpha-1 blockers, and statins incident users compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. We noted a significant decrease in level among NSAIDs, opioids, and antibiotic prevalent users, however, no significant changes in slope were observed.Our findings show a significant impact of COVID-19 measures on prescription trends in the general population. The observed decline among several medication classes was temporary. Further research is needed to monitor prescription trends and better understand if those changes were associated with increased health services and worsened outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4310095337,"In the present study, a neuro-evolutionary scheme is presented for solving a class of singular singularly perturbed boundary value problems (SSP-BVPs) by manipulating the strength of feed-forward artificial neural networks (ANNs), global search particle swarm optimization (PSO) and local search interior-point algorithm (IPA), i.e., ANNs-PSO-IPA. An error-based fitness function is designed using the differential form of the SSP-BVPs and its boundary conditions. The optimization of this fitness function is performed by using the computing capabilities of ANNs-PSO-IPA. Four cases of two SSP systems are tested to confirm the performance of the suggested ANNs-PSO-IPA. The correctness of the scheme is observed by using the comparison of the proposed and the exact solutions. The performance indices through different statistical operators are also provided to solve the SSP-BVPs using the proposed ANNs-PSO-IPA. Moreover, the reliability of the scheme is observed by taking hundred independent executions and different statistical performances have been provided for solving the SSP-BVPs to check the convergence, robustness and accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W4310095827,"Objectives Nurse home visiting (NHV) is widely implemented to address inequities in child and maternal health. However, few studies have examined longer-term effectiveness or delivery within universal healthcare systems. We evaluated the benefits of an Australian NHV program (“right@home”) in promoting children’s language and learning, general and mental health, maternal mental health and wellbeing, parenting and family relationships, at child ages 4 and 5 years. Setting and participants Randomised controlled trial of NHV delivered via universal, child and family health services (the comparator). Pregnant women experiencing adversity (≥2 of 10 risk factors) were recruited from 10 antenatal clinics across 2 states (Victoria, Tasmania) in Australia. Intervention Mothers in the intervention arm were offered 25 nurse home visits (mean 23·2 home visits [SD 7·4, range 1–43] received) of 60–90 minutes, commencing antenatally and continuing until children’s second birthdays. Primary and secondary outcomes measured At 4 and 5 years, outcomes were assessed via parent interview and direct assessment of children’s language and learning (receptive and expressive language, phonological awareness, attention, and executive function). Outcomes were compared between intervention and usual care arms (intention to treat) using adjusted regression with robust estimation to account for nurse/site. Missing data were addressed using multiple imputation and inverse probability weighting. Results Of 722 women enrolled in the trial, 225 of 363 (62%) intervention and 201 of 359 (56%) usual care women provided data at 5 years. Estimated group differences showed an overall pattern favouring the intervention. Statistical evidence of benefits was found across child and maternal mental health and wellbeing, parenting and family relationships with effect sizes ranging 0·01–0·27. Conclusion An Australian NHV program promoted longer-term family functioning and wellbeing for women experiencing adversity. NHV can offer an important component of a proportionate universal system that delivers support and intervention relative to need. Trial registration 2013–2016, registration ISRCTN89962120"
https://openalex.org/W4310154654,"FMS-like receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) expression was reported to increase in the heart in response to pathological stress, but the role of Flt3 activation and its underlying mechanisms remain poorly elucidated. This study was designed to investigate the role of Flt3 activation in sympathetic hyperactivity-induced cardiac hypertrophy and its mechanisms through autophagy and mitochondrial dynamics. In vivo, cardiac hypertrophy was established by subcutaneous injection of isoprenaline (6 mg/kg·day) in C57BL/6 mice for 7 consecutive days. The Flt3-ligand intervention was launched 2 h prior to isoprenaline each day. In vitro, experiments of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, autophagy, and mitochondrial dynamics were performed in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). Our results revealed that the expression level of Flt3 protein was significantly increased in the hypertrophic myocardium provoked by isoprenaline administration. Flt3-ligand intervention alleviated isoprenaline-induced cardiac oxidative stress, hypertrophy, fibrosis, and contractile dysfunction. Isoprenaline stimulation impaired autophagic flux in hypertrophic mouse hearts, supported by the accumulation of LC3II and P62 proteins, while Flt3-ligand restored the impairment of autophagic flux. Flt3 activation normalized the imbalance of mitochondrial fission and fusion in the hearts of mice evoked by isoprenaline as evidenced by the neutralization of elevated mitochondrial fission markers and reduced mitochondrial fusion markers. In NRCMs, Flt3-ligand treatment attenuated isoprenaline-stimulated hypertrophy, which was abolished by a Flt3-specific blocker AC220. Activating Flt3 reversed isoprenaline-induced autophagosome accumulation and impairment of autophagic flux probably by enhancing SIRT1 expression and consequently TFEB nuclear translocation. Flt3 activation improved the imbalance of mitochondrial dynamics induced by isoprenaline in NRCMs through the SIRT1/P53 pathway. Activation of Flt3 mitigated ISO-stimulated hypertrophy probably involves the restoration of autophagic flux and balance of mitochondrial dynamics. Therefore, activation of Flt3 attenuates isoprenaline-induced cardiac hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro, the potential mechanism probably attributes to SIRT1/TFEB-mediated autophagy promotion and SIRT1/P53-mediated mitochondrial dynamics balance. These findings suggest that activation of Flt3 may be a novel target for protection against cardiac remodeling and heart failure during sympathetic hyperactivity."
https://openalex.org/W4309922091,"Crustaceans have an open vascular system in which hemocytes freely circulate in hemolymph. Hemocytes are rich in hemocyanin, a specific oxygen-transport protein in crustaceans; therefore, understanding the response of hemocytes to hypoxia is crucial. Although hemocytes take up glucose during hypoxia, the molecular mechanism of glucose uptake in crustaceans remains unclear. Herein, we identified two highly conserved glucose transporters (GLUT1 and GLUT2) in Macrobrachium nipponense (oriental river prawn) and analyzed their tissue-specific expression patterns. Our immunofluorescence assays showed that GLUT1 and GLUT2 are located on the cell membrane, with a strong GLUT1 signal in primary hemocytes under hypoxia. We found that during acute hypoxia, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α-related metabolic alterations result in decreased mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase activity, implying a classic glycolytic mechanism. As a proof of concept, we replicated these findings in insect S2 cells. Acute hypoxia significantly induced hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, GLUT1, and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 1 expression in primary hemocytes, and hypoxia-induced increases in glucose uptake and lactate secretion were observed. GLUT1 knockdown induced intracellular reactive oxygen species generation and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, resulting in increased prawn mortality and more apoptotic cells in their brains, implying a vital function of GLUT1 in hypoxia adaptation. Taken together, our results suggest a close relationship between hypoxia-mediated glycolysis and GLUT1 in hemocytes. These results demonstrated that in crustaceans, adaptation to hypoxia involves glucose metabolic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W4309938638,"The MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex plays essential roles in the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are the most cytotoxic DNA lesions, and is a target of various modifications and controls. Recently, lysine 48-linked ubiquitination of NBS1, resulting in premature disassembly of the MRN complex from DSB sites, was observed in cells lacking RECQL4 helicase activity. However, the role and control of this ubiquitination during the DSB response in cells with intact RECQL4 remain unknown. Here, we showed that USP2 counteracts this ubiquitination and stabilizes the MRN complex during the DSB response. By screening deubiquitinases that increase the stability of the MRN complex in RECQL4-deficient cells, USP2 was identified as a new deubiquitinase that acts at DSB sites to counteract NBS1 ubiquitination. We determined that USP2 is recruited to DSB sites in a manner dependent on ATM, a major checkpoint kinase against DSBs, and stably interacts with NBS1 and RECQL4 in immunoprecipitation experiments. Phosphorylation of two critical residues in the N terminus of USP2 by ATM is required for its recruitment to DSBs and its interaction with RECQL4. While inactivation of USP2 alone does not substantially influence the DSB response, we found that inactivation of USP2 and USP28, another deubiquitinase influencing NBS1 ubiquitination, results in premature disassembly of the MRN complex from DSB sites as well as defects in ATM activation and homologous recombination repair abilities. These results suggest that deubiquitinases counteracting NBS1 ubiquitination are essential for the stable maintenance of the MRN complex and proper cellular response to DSBs."

However, it has many disadvantages, such as excessive radiation exposure, long operation times, and high cement leakage rates. This study was conducted to explore the clinical effects and safety of the use of a three-dimensional (3D)-printed body-surface guide plate to aid PVP for the treatment of OVCFs.This prospective cohort study was conducted with patients with OVCFs presenting between October 2020 and June 2021. Fifty patients underwent traditional PVP (group T) and 47 patients underwent PVP aided by 3D-printed body-surface guide plates (3D group). The following clinical and adverse events were compared between groups: the puncture positioning, puncture, fluoroscopy exposure and total operation times; changes in vertebral height and the Cobb angle after surgery relative to baseline; preoperative and postoperative visual analog scale and Oswestry disability index scores; and perioperative complications (bone cement leakage, neurological impairment, vertebral infection, and cardiopulmonary complications.The puncture, adjustment, fluoroscopy, and total operation times were shorter in the 3D group than in group T. Visual analog scale and Oswestry disability index scores improved significantly after surgery, with significant differences between groups (both p < 0.05). At the last follow-up examination, the vertebral midline height and Cobb angle did not differ between groups. The incidence of complications was significantly lower in the 3D group than in group T (p < 0.05).The use of 3D-printed body-surface guide plates can simplify and optimize PVP, shortening the operative time, improving the success rate, reducing surgical complications, and overall improving the safety of PVP."
https://openalex.org/W4310092905,"AMPK can activate nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), increasing the ratio of oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)/reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) ratio, leading to the activation of the energy receptor SIRT1. This pathway is known as the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway. SIRT1 deacetylates and activate LKB1, which is activated by phosphorylation of AMPK (Thr172) and inhibited by phosphorylase-mediated dephosphorylation of AMPK. At the same time, increased AMP/ATP and NAD+/NADH ratios lead to the activation of AMPK and SIRT1. SIRT1 and AMPK can activate each other forming a positive feedback loop, which can strengthen catabolism and weaken anabolism thus maintaining energy homeostasis of energy metabolism. At present, there has been no systematic study on AMPK-associated signaling cascades in stored yak meat and details of the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling under these conditions are not known. In this study, NAD+, NADH were added to yak longissimus thoracic muscles to study AMPK pathway regulation by AMPK/SIRT1 signaling. NAD+ significantly increased the activity of AMPK and glycolysis during postmortem maturation, increased the rate of energy metabolism, and increased the expression of AMPK protein, indicating that NAD+ increased energy metabolism in the stored muscle by promoting AMPK activity. NADH treatment inhibited both AMPK activation and glycolysis, together with increasing the pH in the muscle. The results showed that SIRT1 activation elevated the activity of AMPK, leading to its phosphorylation and the activation of glycolysis. Thus, AMPK activity was found to increase in yak meat as an adaptation to hypoxic conditions. This allows more effective regulation of energy production and improves the tenderness of the meat."
https://openalex.org/W4310092932,"Remote sensing can be used to map tillage practices at large spatial and temporal scales. However, detecting such management practices in smallholder systems is challenging given that the size of fields is smaller than historical readily-available satellite imagery. In this study we used newer, higher-resolution satellite data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Planet to map tillage practices in the Eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains in India. We specifically tested the classification performance of single sensor and multiple sensor random forest models, and the impact of spatial, temporal, or spectral resolution on classification accuracy. We found that when considering a single sensor, the model that used Planet imagery (3 m) had the highest classification accuracy (86.55%) while the model that used Sentinel-1 data (10 m) had the lowest classification accuracy (62.28%). When considering sensor combinations, the model that used data from all three sensors achieved the highest classification accuracy (87.71%), though this model was not statistically different from the Planet only model when considering 95% confidence intervals from bootstrap analyses. We also found that high levels of accuracy could be achieved by only using imagery from the sowing period. Considering the impact of spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution on classification accuracy, we found that improved spatial resolution from Planet contributed the most to improved classification accuracy. Overall, it is possible to use readily-available, high spatial resolution satellite data to map tillage practices of smallholder farms, even in heterogeneous systems with small field sizes."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between recent overdose and whether or not chronic pain is active. 3,577 individuals in treatment for opioid use disorder in 2017 or 2018 were surveyed regarding recent overdoses and chronic pain. Demographics from the 2017 Treatment Episode Data Set, which includes all U.S. facilities licensed or certified to provide substance use care, were used to evaluate the generalizability of the sample. χ 2 tests and logistic regression models were used to compare associations between recent overdoses and chronic pain. Specifically, active chronic pain was associated with opioid overdose among people in treatment for opioid use disorder. Individuals with active chronic pain were more likely to have had a past month opioid overdose than those with no history chronic pain (adjusted OR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.16–2.08, p = 0.0003). In contrast, individuals with prior chronic pain, but no symptoms in the past 30 days, had a risk of past month opioid overdose similar to those with no history of chronic pain (adjusted OR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.66–1.17, p = 0.38). This suggests that the incorporation of treatment for chronic pain into treatment for opioid use disorder may reduce opioid overdoses."
https://openalex.org/W4310092949,"Cognitive impairment and dementia have a high prevalence among the elderly and cause significant socio-economic impact. Any progress in their prevention can benefit millions of people. Current data indicate that cardiovascular risk (CVR) factors increase the risk of developing cognitive impairment and dementia. Using models to calculate CVR specific for the Spanish population can be useful for estimating the risk of cognitive deterioration since research on this topic is limited and predicting this risk is mainly based on outcomes in the Anglo-Saxon population. The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between CVR in the Spanish population, as calculated using the FRESCO (Función de Riesgo Española de acontecimientos Coronarios y Otros) and REGICOR (Registre Gironí del Cor) CVR tables, and the change in cognitive performance at a 5-year follow-up.Design: Observational, analytic, prospective cohort study, with a 5-year follow-up. Ambit: Population. Population: Subjects 55 to 74 years of age, included in the NEDICES2 (2014-2017) cohort, who did not present dementia and had undergone the neuropsychological evaluation (N = 962). Variables: Exposure factors (CVR factors and estimated risk according to the CVR predictors by REGICOR and FRESCO), dependent variables (change in the score of the brief neuropsychological test in the study NEDICES2 five years after the first evaluation), and clinical and socio-demographic variables. Statistical analysis: Analysis of data quality. Descriptive analysis: socio-demographic and clinical variables of subjects. Bivariate analysis: relationship between basal CVR and change in neuropsychological tests. Multivariate analysis: relationship between basal CVR and change in neuropsychological tests adjusted by co-variables. Analysis and comparison of the reliable change in independent samples.The Spanish population can benefit from determining if individuals with high CVR, which is commonly detected in usual clinical practice, will present decreased cognitive performance compared to subjects with lower CVR. This study can affect how to address CVR factors and the design of effective prevention strategies for cognitive deterioration.Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03925844."
https://openalex.org/W4310095185,"Disruptions of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuit has been implicated in both attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and substance use disorder. Given the high prevalence of cannabis use among patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, we set out to investigate the relationship between the two in the thalamus. We analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data obtained from the Addiction Connectome Preprocessed Initiative Multimodal Treatment Study of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder database. Functional connectivity maps were extracted to compare thalamic connectivity among adults who had been diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder during childhood according to whether or not they used cannabis. The study participants included 18 cannabis users and 15 cannabis non-users with childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Our results revealed that adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder who used cannabis (n = 18) had significantly decreased functional connectivity between the thalamus and parietal regions, which was particularly prominent in the inferior parietal areas, in comparison with those who did not use cannabis (n = 15). Left thalamic functional connectivity with the inferior parietal and middle frontal areas and right thalamic functional connectivity with the inferior parietal and superior frontal areas were increased in non-users of cannabis with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder compared with a local normative comparison group (n = 7). In conclusion, adults with a childhood history of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder who do not use cannabis often have relatively stronger thalamoparietal and thalamofrontal connectivity, which may help reduce the risk of cannabis use."
https://openalex.org/W4310095249,"The protein kinase Gcn2 is present in virtually all eukaryotic cells. It is best known for its role in helping cells cope with amino acid starvation. Under starvation, Gcn2 phosphorylates the α subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), to stimulate a signal transduction pathway that allows cells to cope and overcome starvation. Gcn2 has been implicated in many additional biological functions. It appears that for all functions, Gcn2 must directly bind to its effector protein Gcn1, mediated via a region in Gcn1 called the RWD binding domain (RWDBD). Arg-2259 in this region is important for Gcn2 binding. Overexpression of a Gcn1 fragment only encompassing the RWDBD binds Gcn2, thereby disrupting endogenous Gcn1-Gcn2 interaction which dampens Gcn2 activation. Consequently, cells are unable to increase eIF2α phosphorylation under starvation conditions, visible by impaired growth. This dominant negative phenotype is reverted by the R2259A substitution, again allowing Gcn1-Gcn2 interaction and enhanced eIF2α phosphorylation. We have found that the amino acid substitutions, R2289A, R2297A, and K2301A, also reverted the dominant negative phenotype as well as allowed enhanced eIF2α phosphorylation, as found previously for the R2259A substitution. This suggests that the respective amino acids are relevant for the overexpressed RWDBD to disrupt Gcn1-Gcn2 interaction and impair Gcn2 activation, supporting the idea that in Gcn1 these amino acids mediate Gcn2-binding. Our findings suggest that two helices in Gcn1 constitute a Gcn2 binding site. We serendipitously found amino acid substitutions that enhanced the dominant negative phenotype that correlated with a further reduction in eIF2α-P levels, suggesting that the respective RWDBD variants are more potent in disrupting Gcn1-Gcn2 interaction."
https://openalex.org/W4310095856,"As the foundation of the industrial economy, the equipment manufacturing industry takes an important position on the China-EU trade. Based on the analysis of the overall trend and structure of China-EU equipment manufacturing industry trade in 2007-2020, this article involves the construction of trade concentration into trade dependence metrics, and then calculate the degree of interdependence between China and EU equipment manufacturing trade in 2020. The perspective of the intra-industry specialization will be used to analyze China-EU equipment manufacturing trade dependency in 2020. The results show that: (1) Although China-EU equipment manufacturing trade has continued to grow, China had an imbalanced export structure to the EU, and electronic equipment exports are too high; (2) Regardless of import or export, the trade dependence of the EU countries on China about equipment manufacturing was higher than that of China on European countries; (3) China mainly depended on the EU about the high-end equipment manufacturing trade, which brings risks to Chinese manufacturing supply chains."
https://openalex.org/W4310095959,"It is known that exercise can be one of the causes of muscular damage. In recent times, physiotherapists and medical professionals have been employing USGET techniques to stimulate muscle recovery to improve its performance after the injury. We pretend to analyse if the Ultrasound-guided electrolysis (USGET) technique could reduce muscle damage, inflammation, and pain in the present study. Female Wistar rats were assigned to one of three different groups: control (C), notexin (NOT) and notexin with USGET (electrolysis at 6mA) (NOT+USGET). We used the USGT technique, based on electrical stimulation with a continuous current of 4 pulses at an intensity of 6 mA for 5 seconds, conveyed to the muscle. The response was tested with motor function tests. In these tests, we could observe an increase in time and foot faults when crossing a beam in the NOT group compared to C group rats. On the other hand, a significant decrease in both variables was detected in the NOT+USGET compared to the NOT group. Muscle power was measured with a grip strength test, obtaining far better performances in NOT+USGET rats when compared to NOT rats. Moreover, the USGET technique prevented the increase of pro-inflammatory proteins IL-6 and chemokines CCL3 (Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3), CCL4 (Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4), and CCL5 (Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5) with their receptor CCR5 (C-C chemokine receptor type 5), induced by notexin in the quadriceps. At the same time, the study evidenced a decrease in both CCR8 (C-C chemokine receptor type 5,) and NF-ᴋB (nuclear factor- ᴋB) expressions after USGET treatment. On the other hand, we obtained evidence that demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties of the USGET technique, thus being the increase in IL-10 (Interleukin 10) and IL-13 (Interleukin 13) in the NOT+USGET group compared to the NOT group. Furthermore, when applying NSGET after damage, an increase in anti-inflammatory mediators and reduction of pro-inflammatory mediators, which, overall, promoted muscle regeneration, was observed. These results support the idea that the NSGET technique improves muscle recovery after toxic damages, which would justify its employment."
https://openalex.org/W4310095992,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a highly contagious pathogenic viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly and remains a challenge to global public health. COVID-19 patients manifest various symptoms from mild to severe cases with poor clinical outcomes. Prognostic values of novel markers, including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and C-reactive protein to lymphocyte ratio (CLR) calculated from routine laboratory parameters have recently been reported to predict severe cases; however, whether this investigation can guide oxygen therapy in COVID-19 patients remains unclear. In this study, we assessed the ability of these markers in screening and predicting types of oxygen therapy in COVID-19 patients. The retrospective data of 474 COVID-19 patients were categorized into mild and severe cases and grouped according to the types of oxygen therapy requirement, including noninvasive oxygen support, high-flow nasal cannula and invasive mechanical ventilator. Among the novel markers, the ROC curve analysis indicated a screening cutoff of CRP ≥ 30.0 mg/L, NLR ≥ 3.0 and CLR ≥ 25 in predicting the requirement of any type of oxygen support. The NLR and CLR with increasing cut-off values have discriminative power with high accuracy and specificity for more effective oxygen therapy with a high-flow nasal cannula (NLR ≥ 6.0 and CLR ≥ 60) and mechanical ventilator (NLR ≥ 8.0 and CLR ≥ 80). Our study thus identifies potential markers to differentiate the suitable management of oxygen therapy in COVID-19 patients at an earlier time for improving disease outcomes with limited respiratory support resources."
https://openalex.org/W4310096008,"Speech with high sound quality and little noise is central to many of our communication tools, including calls, video conferencing and hearing aids. While human ratings provide the best measure of sound quality, they are costly and time-intensive to gather, thus computational metrics are typically used instead. Here we present a non-intrusive, deep learning-based metric that takes only a sound sample as an input and returns ratings in three categories: overall quality, noise, and sound quality. This metric is available via a web API and is composed of a deep neural network ensemble with 5 networks that use either ResNet-26 architectures with STFT inputs or fully-connected networks with wav2vec features as inputs. The networks are trained and tested on over 1 million crowd-sourced human sound ratings across the three categories. Correlations of our metric with human ratings exceed or match other state-of-the-art metrics on 51 out of 56 benchmark scenes, while not requiring clean speech reference samples as opposed to metrics that are performing well on the other 5 scenes. The benchmark scenes represent a wide variety of acoustic environments and a large selection of post-processing methods that include classical methods (e.g. Wiener-filtering) and newer deep-learning methods."
https://openalex.org/W4310150448,"Background Mental health services are advocated to move from specialized care to more integrated and accessible primary care settings. The integration of mental health into primary health services is expanding in Ethiopia. However, there is a lack of research on the perspectives of health professionals on mental health services in Ethiopia. This study aimed to explore the perspectives, views, and experiences of health professionals regarding mental health services and the help-seeking behavior of people with mental illness in Northwest Ethiopia. Methods This qualitative study included sixteen health professionals. The participants were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. Interviews were conducted in Amharic and translated into English. We analyzed the data using reflexive thematic analysis. Results Five key themes were generated from the interview data: (1) Avoidance of mental healthcare; (2) Low literacy about mental illness; (3) Stigma as a hindrance to accessing mental health services; (4) The role of culture and religion in mental health services; and (5) Lack of government concern about mental health services. Conclusion This study identified important factors related to mental health services in Northwest Ethiopia, from the perspectives of health professionals. Our findings highlighted that the government health agenda needs to prioritize mental health services. The role of religious and cultural healing places in the help-seeking pathway should be given due consideration to ensure success in mental health services provision and utilization."
https://openalex.org/W4310150487,"Input-shaping control has received considerable research attention for suppressing residual vibrations. Although numerous studies have been conducted on designing input shapers with arbitrary robustness to modeling errors, no studies have focused on the design of input shapers with arbitrarily specified shaping times. In this study, a specified-duration (SD) shaper, which is an input shaper with an arbitrarily specified shaping time, and a systematic method to design an SD shaper using impulse vectors are proposed. As the specified shaping time increases, the SD shaper increases the number of impulses one by one according to the number of added derivative constraints, thereby improving robustness to modeling errors. The performance of the SD shaper was evaluated for a second-order system through computer simulations. The simulation results revealed that the SD shaper suppresses residual vibrations of the vibratory system at the specified shaping time. The validity of the SD shaper was experimentally verified using a horizontal beam vibration apparatus. The results of this study provide insight into the development of vibration suppression strategies with input shaping control."
https://openalex.org/W4309938601,"The Apolipoprotein E-ε4 allele (APOE-ε4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer disease (AD). ApoE plays a critical role in amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation in AD, and genetic deletion of the murine ApoE gene in mouse models results in a decrease or inhibition of Aβ deposition. The association between the presence of ApoE and amyloid in amyloidoses suggests a more general role for ApoE in the fibrillogenesis process. However, whether decreasing levels of ApoE would attenuate amyloid pathology in different amyloidoses has not been directly addressed. Familial Danish dementia (FDD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by the presence of widespread parenchymal and vascular Danish amyloid (ADan) deposition and neurofibrillary tangles. A transgenic mouse model for FDD (Tg-FDD) is characterized by parenchymal and vascular ADan deposition. To determine the effect of decreasing ApoE levels on ADan accumulation in vivo, we generated a mouse model by crossing Tg-FDD mice with ApoE KO mice (Tg-FDD+/-/ApoE-/-). Lack of ApoE results in inhibition of ADan deposition up to 18 months of age. Additionally, our results from a genetic screen of Tg-FDD+/-/ApoE-/- mice emphasize the significant role for ApoE in neurodegeneration in FDD via glial-mediated mechanisms. Taken together, our findings suggest that the interaction between ApoE and ADan plays a key role in FDD pathogenesis, in addition to the known role for ApoE in amyloid plaque formation in AD."
https://openalex.org/W4309938757,"Type IIB receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases are cell surface transmembrane proteins that engage in cell adhesion via their extracellular domains (ECDs) and cell signaling via their cytoplasmic phosphatase domains. The ECDs of type IIB receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases form stable, homophilic, and trans interactions between adjacent cell membranes. Previous work has demonstrated how one family member, PTPRM, forms head-to-tail homodimers. However, as the interface was composed of residues conserved across the family, the determinants of homophilic specificity remain unknown. Here, we have solved the X-ray crystal structure of the membrane-distal N-terminal domains of PTPRK that form a head-to-tail dimer consistent with intermembrane adhesion. Comparison with the PTPRM structure demonstrates interdomain conformational differences that may define homophilic specificity. Using small-angle X-ray scattering, we determined the solution structures of the full-length ECDs of PTPRM and PTPRK, identifying that both are rigid extended molecules that differ in their overall long-range conformation. Furthermore, we identified one residue, W351, within the interaction interface that differs between PTPRM and PTPRK and showed that mutation to glycine, the equivalent residue in PTPRM, abolishes PTPRK dimer formation in vitro. This comparison of two members of the receptor tyrosine phosphatase family suggests that homophilic specificity is driven by a combination of shape complementarity and specific but limited sequence differences."
https://openalex.org/W4310070104,"Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) are nuclear transcription factors that partner with other nuclear receptors to regulate numerous physiological processes. Although RXR represents a valid therapeutic target, only a few RXR-specific ligands (rexinoids) have been identified, in part due to the lack of clarity on how rexinoids selectively modulate RXR response. Previously, we showed that rexinoid UAB30 potentiates all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) signaling in human keratinocytes, in part by stimulating ATRA biosynthesis. Here, we examined the mechanism of action of next-generation rexinoids UAB110 and UAB111 that are more potent in vitro than UAB30 and the FDA-approved Targretin. Both UAB110 and UAB111 enhanced ATRA signaling in human organotypic epithelium at a 50-fold lower concentration than UAB30. This was consistent with the 2- to 5- fold greater increase in ATRA in organotypic epidermis treated with UAB110/111 versus UAB30. Furthermore, at 0.2 μM, UAB110/111 increased the expression of ATRA genes up to 16-fold stronger than Targretin. The less toxic and more potent UAB110 also induced more changes in differential gene expression than Targretin. Additionally, our hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry analysis showed that both ligands reduced the dynamics of the ligand-binding pocket but also induced unique dynamic responses that were indicative of higher affinity binding relative to UAB30, especially for Helix 3. UAB110 binding also showed increased dynamics towards the dimer interface through the Helix 8 and Helix 9 regions. These data suggest that UAB110 and UAB111 are potent activators of RXR-RAR signaling pathways but accomplish activation through different molecular responses to ligand binding."
https://openalex.org/W4310092897,"Falls are common and often lead to serious physical and psychological consequences for older persons. The occurrence of falls are usually attributed to the interaction between multiple risk factors. The clinical evaluation of falls risks is time-consuming as a result, hence limiting its availability. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to develop a clustering-based algorithm to determine falls risk. Data from the Malaysian Elders Longitudinal Research (MELoR), comprising 1411 subjects aged ≥55 years, were utilized. The proposed algorithm was developed through the stages of: data pre-processing, feature identification and extraction with either t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) or principal component analysis (PCA)), clustering (K-means clustering, Hierarchical clustering, and Fuzzy C-means clustering) and characteristics interpretation with statistical analysis. A total of 1279 subjects and 9 variables were selected for clustering after the data pre-possessing stage. Using feature extraction with the t-SNE and the K-means clustering algorithm, subjects were clustered into low, intermediate A, intermediate B and high fall risk groups which corresponded with fall occurrence of 13%, 19%, 21% and 31% respectively. Slower gait, poorer balance, weaker muscle strength, presence of cardiovascular disorder, poorer cognitive performance, and advancing age were the key variables identified. The proposed fall risk clustering algorithm grouped the subjects according to features. Such a tool could serve as a case identification or clinical decision support tool for clinical practice to enhance access to falls prevention efforts."
https://openalex.org/W4310092943,"Eating disorders are associated with one of the highest mortality rates among all mental disorders, yet there is very little research about them within the newly emerging and promising field of computational psychiatry. As such, we focus on investigating a previously unexplored, yet core aspect of eating disorders-body image dissatisfaction. We continue a freshly opened debate about model-based learning and its trade-off against model-free learning-a proxy for goal-directed and habitual behaviour. We perform a behavioural study that utilises a two-step decision-making task and a reinforcement learning model to understand the effect of body image dissatisfaction on model-based learning in a population characterised by high scores of disordered eating and negative appearance beliefs, as recruited using Prolific. We find a significantly reduced model-based contribution in the body image dissatisfaction task condition in the population of interest as compared to a healthy control. This finding suggests general deficits in deliberate control in this population, leading to habitual, compulsive-like behaviours (body checking) dominating the experience. Importantly, the results may inform treatment approaches, which could focus on enhancing the reliance on goal-directed decision making to help cope with unwanted behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W4310095244,"Cocaine abuse has a negative impact on the immune system. To investigate the adverse effects of binge cocaine administration on lymphoid organs such as thymus and spleen, we examined the effects of repeated intravenous (i.v.) administration of cocaine on rats. Sprague Dawley rats (male, 8 weeks old) received 20 mg/kg body weight of cocaine hydrochloride per day for 7 or 14 days. In addition to a significant loss in the weight of the spleen, consistent with our previous intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection model of binge cocaine abuse (50 mg/kg cocaine for 7 days), we also found a significant loss of weight as well as apparent shrinkage of the thymus in the cocaine group. Transcriptome analysis of the thymus revealed increased expressions of genes involved in apoptosis, such as Ifi27 and Traf2, as well as decreased expressions of several genes related to lipid metabolism, such as Cd36, Adipoq, Scd1, and Fabp4, in the thymus of the cocaine group (7 days), suggesting an apoptotic loss of thymic cells as well as alterations in lipid metabolism. Paradoxically, cocaine activates PPARγ, a key transcriptional factor activating lipid metabolism, although ectopic adipogenesis was scarcely observed in the thymus. Further analysis of rats administered 20 mg/kg cocaine for 14 days revealed ectopic adipogenesis, which was accompanied with the activation of PPARγ as well as increased expression of Adipoq and Fabp4, in the thymus. Taken together, these results indicate that repeated cocaine administration induces thymic involution, which is initiated by the loss of thymic cells through apoptosis and subsequent ectopic adipocyte development."
https://openalex.org/W4310095259,"Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) often experience fatigue. The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) is a valid tool for evaluating fatigue; however, its psychometric properties have not been examined in Indonesian-speaking patients with T2DM. This study assessed the psychometric properties of the Indonesian version of the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20 (IMFI-20) in patients with T2DM and investigated fatigue in a health-care setting. A cross-sectional design was adopted. Two hundred patients with T2DM were interviewed in clinics. Five self-structured measures were used to assess the frequency and duration of fatigue and the health-care utilization of patients with fatigue. Cronbach's alpha and intraclass correlation (ICC) were used to evaluate the internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the Indonesian version of the MFI-20 (IMFI-20). The criterion, convergent, and known-group validity of the IMFI-20 were also examined, and its underlying structure was determined using explanatory factor analysis. The STROBE checklist was used. The results revealed that approximately half of the patients experienced fatigue. Among those with fatigue, 62% reported that their fatigue was rarely or never treated by their physicians. The IMFI-20 exhibited satisfactory model fit, excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha of 0.92), and test-retest ICC of 0.93. The IMFI-20 was significantly associated with the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue, Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (r = 0.705, 0.670, and 0.581, respectively). The IMFI-20 exhibited known-group validity for unfavorable sleep quality and HbA1C ≥ 6.5%. Our findings suggest that patients with T2DM who experience fatigue are often overlooked by health-care providers, and that the IMFI-20, which exhibits excellent psychometric properties, can be adopted by studies that use fatigue as an endpoint in Indonesian-speaking populations."

Animal experiments were carried out to verify the effect of LTG for the treatment of ICH, combined with behavior test and morphologic detection. Results Forty-three active components in LTG and involved 192 gene targets were identified successfully. Moreoner, they were intersected with 1132 genes of ICH,88 intersection targets were obtained. subsequently, Cytoscape was used to screen Hub genes, in which,6 core molecules, including AKT1, IL6, VEGFA, CASP3, JUN and MMP9 were recognized. Furthermore, we constructed Six core compounds by "" disease-drug-active ingredient-target-KEGG "" (D-D-A-T-K) network, showed including quercetin, luteolin, β sitosterol, stigmasterol, kaempferol and formononetin, and PPI protein network interaction showed that AKT1:OS3 and CNA2:DKN1A had the highest correlation. Whereas the enrichment of GO and KEGG indicated that LTG was most likely to play a therapeutic role in ICH through AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications. Integrated analysis also showed that the first 10 pathways of KEGG are integrated into 59 genes, among which 6 core genes are closely involved. Lastly, molecular docking showed that there was a good binding activity between the core components and the core genes, and animal experiments confirmed effect of LTG in the treatment of ICH, by using TTC staining and behavior test. Conclusion LTG are effective for the treatment of ICH, the underlying mechanism could be involved in gene network including anti-inflammatory response, nerve repair, analgesia, anti-epilepsy and other aspects."

It can lead to prolonged infection, increased transmission, drug resistance, and loss of life. Even though the causative microorganism of TB has been identified for more than a century, the disease is still a substantial public health problem worldwide. This research aims to devise, implement, and assess an educational intervention to improve adherence to TB treatment. Methods and findings A randomised clinical trial involving 146 Sudanese TB patients will be conducted at the Abu Anga hospital in Khartoum. The participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. A 2-hour session will be offered to the intervention group in a one-day TB educational intervention course. The same educational materials will also be provided to the control group after the randomised controlled trial (RCT). Data will be collected at baseline, one month, and four months after the intervention. The primary outcome of interest is TB treatment adherence, while secondary outcomes include quality of life score, tuberculosis knowledge, and health belief domains. Generalised estimating equations (GEE) in SPSS software version 25.0 will be utilised to evaluate the changes over time. Conclusions This trial will provide information that could be used in improving TB control strategies to achieve better results in the adherence of healthcare services to the norms of the National Program and patient adherence to the disease treatment and cure.

https://openalex.org/W4310095321,"The pedicle screw (PS) is widely used for spinal fixation surgery. However, PS malpositioning can cause critical complications; thus, the accuracy of ascertaining PS trajectory is paramount. This study aimed to demonstrate the accuracy and safety of a simple and cost-effective PS placement technique using a human internal reference frame for angle estimation. Ex vivo lumbar porcine spine samples were fixed to a wooden board with rostrocaudal and mediolateral rotational angles adjusted by two angle vises. PS entry points (EPs) were identified using clear anatomical vertebral landmarks. PS placement was performed on one side using the perpendicular probing and screwing technique (PPST), wherein the attitude angle of the sample was adjusted such that the longitudinal axis of the target pedicle was perpendicular to the ground. The pedicle probe and PS driver were manually maintained perpendicular to the ground during probing and PS placement. PS placement on the contralateral side was performed freehand as a control. Offsets between the preoperatively planned and implanted PS rotational angles measured using computed tomography for PPST and freehand method were analyzed. Pedicle wall penetration was also evaluated. The mean ± standard error of the medial rotational offsets was 5.83° ± 0.57° in the freehand group versus 2.89° ± 0.31° in the PPST group (p <0.001), and the rostrocaudal rotational offsets were 4.81° ± 0.65° in the freehand group versus 2.92° ± 0.45° in the PPST group (p = 0.01). The mean pedicle wall penetration distance was significantly reduced by PPST (0.28 ± 0.12 mm vs 0.80 ± 0.17 mm in the freehand group, p = 0.0071). Thus, PPST improved PS positioning accuracy, resulting in reduced pedicle wall penetration and increased PS placement safety. This simple technique is also potentially cost-effective for institutions without computer-assisted surgical systems."

The objectives of this study were to describe symptoms considered to be the most troublesome by patients with PA, and to explore health related worries and expectations following treatment. Methods This was an explorative qualitative study where 25 patients with PA, diagnosed between 2017 and 2019, were included; 13 patients who had undergone adrenalectomy and 12 who were receiving medical treatment. Data was collected during six group interviews and analyzed using a thematic approach. Results Three main themes were identified: 1) Distress of the past , where the most important issues were struggle to receive a correct diagnosis, impaired well-being and the consumption of a large number of tablets, 2) Satisfaction after receiving a correct diagnosis , both in patients with unilateral and bilateral disease, but also dissatisfaction with lack of information about the disease, and 3) Future concerns , where worries about the long-term effects of PA on health in general dominated. Conclusions Our findings illustrate several important issues related to PA where improvements in patient care are needed, including actions aiming at shortening the long diagnostic delay, a thorough information to the patients about the disease is of great importance, and that all patients with PA, regardless of treatment, would benefit from a structured long-term follow-up."

Knowledge of community transmission of COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses is essential to better predict subsequent surges in cases during the pandemic to alert health services, protect vulnerable populations and enhance public health measures. We describe a methodology for a testing-based sentinel surveillance program to monitor disease in the community for early signal detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. Methods/design A longitudinal active testing-based sentinel surveillance program for respiratory viruses (including SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B and Respiratory Syncytial Virus) will be implemented in some regions of Queensland. Adults will be eligible for enrolment if they are part of specific community groups at increased risk of exposure and have not had a COVID-19 infection in the last 13 weeks. Recruitment via workplaces will occur in-person, via email and through online advertisement. Asymptomatic participants will be tested via PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection by weekly self-collected nasal swabs. In addition, symptomatic participants will be asked to seek SARS-CoV-2 and additional respiratory virus PCR testing at nominated COVID-19 testing sites. SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory virus prevalence data will be analysed weekly and at the end of the study period. Discussion Once implemented, this surveillance program will determine the weekly prevalence of COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses in the broader community by testing a representative sample of adults, with an aim to detect early changes in the baseline positivity rate. This information is essential to define the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in the community in near-real time to inform public health control measures and prepare health services and other stakeholders for a rise in service demand."
https://openalex.org/W4310095841,"This study explored healthcare professionals’ perceived role in talking to adult patients about sharing their diagnosis with children. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore healthcare professionals’ beliefs about how families could and should be supported when a parent has a serious illness. Participants were 24 healthcare professionals working in primary, secondary and tertiary NHS services in the UK with adult patients diagnosed with a serious illness. Data were analysed thematically. Many healthcare professionals reported systems to identify patients’ family relationships, but this information was rarely used to initiate conversations on what and how to talk to children. It was frequently assumed that someone else in the healthcare system was supporting patients with family communication. Others reported there were more urgent priorities for the consultation or considered that talking to children was a private family matter. However, several professionals did undertake these conversations, viewing this as a central part of their role. Some healthcare professionals felt they had inadequate skills or confidence to raise talking to children with their patients and indicated a need for specific training to address this. The results highlight the importance of systematically documenting patients’ relationships with children so that this information can be used to inform ongoing discussions with the healthcare team about what children have been told. Patients consistently report wanting support about how to talk to children and the benefits of effective communication are well documented. Dissemination of this evidence could encourage professionals across all specialities to include family-centred communication in routine patient care. Training resources are needed so that staff feel empowered and equipped to raise these sensitive subjects with their patients."
https://openalex.org/W4310095845,"The genetic modification of cattle has many agricultural and biomedical applications. However, random integration often leads to the unstable or differentially expression of the exogenous genes, which limit the application and development of transgenic technologies. Finding a safe locus suitable for site-specific insertion and efficient expression of exogenous genes is a good way to overcome these hurdles. In this study, we efficiently integrated three targeted vector into the cattle Rosa26 (cRosa26) by CRISPR/Cas9 technology in which EGFP was driven by CAG, EF1a, PGK and cRosa26 endogenous promoter respectively. The CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in system allows highly efficient gene insertion of different expression units at the cRosa26 locus. We also find that in the four cell lines, EGFP was stable expressed at different times, and the CAG promoter has the highest activity to activate the expression of EGFP, when compared with the cRosa26, EF1a and PGK promoter. Our results proved that cRosa26 was a locus that could integrate different expression units efficiently, and supported the friendly expression of different expression units. Our findings described here will be useful for a variety of studies using cattle."
https://openalex.org/W4310095878,"Based on the finite element theory, a joint-plane modeling method is employed to connect the corresponding nodes at the joint surface of the woodworking computer numerical control (CNC) machining center bed with a 2-node 12-degree-of-freedom unit. A spatial element model is established, which can show the state of the nodes between joint surfaces when they are stretched, compressed, or twisted; and it can help build a woodworking CNC machining center on a finite element model of bed with the characteristics of the joint surface. The simulated analysis is performed on the model and is compared with the result of simulated analysis on the bed model that ignores the characteristics of the joint surface and modal experiment. The comparison verifies the effectiveness of the modeling method based on the characteristics of the joint surface. The weak link of the machine bed structure is analyzed and optimized. The natural frequency of the bed is improved by2.55% ~ 11.3%. The displacement is reduced by a maximum of 19.4%, and dynamic performance of the bed is improved."
https://openalex.org/W4310095973,"The concept of safety climate has gained attention from safety experts as one of the most efficient and effective ways to deal with occupational accidents and injuries across industries. This paper explores the safety climate and the effect of employees' demographic variables on the safety climate perception in the printing industry. We adopted the Safety Climate Scale (SCS) developed by Ghahramani and Khalkhali to measure the safety climate in the print manufacturing industry of Ghana. Our findings, based on all the dimensions in the scale, revealed an unsafe safety climate. Also, there was a correlation between demographic factors (age, gender, experience, and education) and perception of workplace safety climate. The major contribution of this paper is to extend empirical research that provides a greater understanding of the health and safety environment within the printing industry of Ghana and the personal and collective attitudes and patterns of behaviour that determine the commitment to organisations' health and safety practices. These findings are important for managers in the printing industry because they provide evidence about the current safety climate so that management can take the action to reduce risks and improve performance. To improve the safety climate, we recommend that management and other stakeholders within the printing industry must commit and communicate effectively, embrace safety practices and procedures, and be more accountable and responsible to minimise the effects of a poor safety climate."
https://openalex.org/W4310095990,"Mental health is one of the most important contributors to the global burden of disease in children and adolescents. Mental health conditions are associated with lower quality of life in adulthood. These conditions have an early onset and typically first occur in childhood. However, little is known about how these conditions are related to service utilization before the initial diagnosis, or about the significance of the diagnosis on later service utilization. To study this, register data on 5-15-year-old children in the city of Oulu, Finland, covering the years 2013-2018 were used. To identify the association of mental health and behavioral conditions with service utilization, counterfactuals were constructed from children who were similarly diagnosed three years later. Event study regressions on several health care and service utilization outcomes were estimated. The findings showed that primary and specialized health care utilization increased sharply before the initial diagnosis and peaked during the time of diagnosis. Primary care utilization started decreasing slowly after, while specialized health care utilization remained high for two years after the diagnosis. Probability of visiting a mental health professional, use of rehabilitation services, psychiatric medication, and utilization of child protection services increased significantly after the diagnosis. The results highlighted the importance of outpatient health care in detecting and treating the conditions in children. In a fragmented system, knowledge on utilization trajectories in different services may be of help in allocating resources to improve the health of these children."
https://openalex.org/W4310096204,"The bumblebee Bombus terrestris is commonly infected by a trypanosomatid gut parasite Crithidia bombi. This system shows a striking degree of genetic specificity where host genotypes are susceptible to different genotypes of parasite. To a degree, variation in host gene expression underlies these differences, however, the effects of standing genetic variation has not yet been explored. Here we report on an extensive experiment where workers of twenty colonies of B. terrestris were each infected by one of twenty strains of C. bombi. To elucidate the host's genetic bases of susceptibility to infection (measured as infection intensity), we used a low-coverage (~2 x) genome-wide association study (GWAS), based on angsd, and a standard high-coverage (~15x) GWAS (with a reduced set from a 8 x 8 interaction matrix, selected from the full set of twenty). The results from the low-coverage approach remained ambiguous. The high-coverage approach suggested potentially relevant genetic variation in cell surface and adhesion processes. In particular, mucin, a surface mucoglycoprotein, potentially affecting parasite binding to the host gut epithelia, emerged as a candidate. Sequencing the gut microbial community of the same bees showed that the abundance of bacterial taxa, such as Gilliamella, Snodgrassella, or Lactobacillus, differed between 'susceptible' and 'resistant' microbiota, in line with earlier studies. Our study suggests that the constitutive microbiota and binding processes at the cell surface are candidates to affect infection intensity after the first response (captured by gene expression) has run its course. We also note that a low-coverage approach may not be powerful enough to analyse such complex traits. Furthermore, testing large interactions matrices (as with the full 20 x 20 combinations) for the effect of interaction terms on infection intensity seems to blur the specific host x parasite interaction effects, likely because the outcome of an infection is a highly non-linear process dominated by variation in individually different pathways of host defence (immune) responses."
https://openalex.org/W4310150512,"China is determined to accomplish universal preschool education by asking the kindergartens to participate in social responsibility programs. This study intends to assess the level of participation of inclusive kindergartens in social responsibility programs. This study uses the Delphi expert method, integrated ISO26000 International Standard Guidelines for Social Responsibility, CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) Scale, and the characteristics of the preschool education industry to construct a social responsibility evaluation model for inclusive kindergartens. It includes five dimensions (responsibility management, customer responsibility, employee responsibility, social service, and organizational responsibility) to show the social responsibility status of kindergartens. Data was collected from 832 respondents from 27 provinces, cities, and regions in China. This study reveals that the overall performance of social responsibility of inclusive kindergarten (3.67) is better, while organization responsibility (3.91) shows the highest performance. In comparison, customer (3.63) and staff responsibility (3.63) deliver average performance, and responsibility management (3.56) offers lower performance. The statistical analysis shows that the nature of kindergartens, whether inclusive or not, the number of classes, years of establishment, the distribution area, and performance are different. Kindergartens should have certain social values, including specific behaviors and participating in social activities in the spirit of social service. They should ensure preschool teacher’s professional and vocational development through multiple subjects’ synergetic governance. In addition to fulfilling the teachers’ social responsibility and professional development, the findings can put forward the cooperation with the government, social organizations, and kindergartens to improve teachers’ professional quality and social responsibility."
https://openalex.org/W4310150516,"Cerebral organoids show great promise as tools to unravel the complex mechanisms by which the mammalian brain develops during embryogenesis. We generated mouse cerebral organoids harbouring constitutive or conditional mutations in Pax6, which encodes a transcription factor with multiple important roles in brain development. By comparing the phenotypes of mutant organoids with the well-described phenotypes of Pax6 mutant mouse embryos, we evaluated the extent to which cerebral organoids reproduce phenotypes previously described in vivo. Organoids lacking Pax6 showed multiple phenotypes associated with its activity in mice, including precocious neural differentiation, altered cell cycle and an increase in abventricular mitoses. Neural progenitors in both Pax6 mutant and wild type control organoids cycled more slowly than their in vivo counterparts, but nonetheless we were able to identify clear changes to cell cycle attributable to the absence of Pax6. Our findings support the value of cerebral organoids as tools to explore mechanisms of brain development, complementing the use of mouse models."
