Nuclei of numerous glia cells were found labeled in brain regions associated with the traumatized areas. In addition, some neurons and neuroblasts showed labeling, suggesting the possibility of proliferation of neurons in adult rats."

https://openalex.org/W1995681933,"2-Dimethylallyl- 5,9-dimethyl-2'-hydroxybenzomorphan (Win 20,228) was found to be a weak antagonist of morphine and meperidine, whereas 2-allyl-5-ethyl-2'- hydroxy-9-methyl-6,7-benzomorphan (Win 19,362) and 2-allyl-2'-hydroxy-5,9- dimethyl-6,7-benzomorphan (Win 19,631) were about three times as potent as nalorphine. Preliminary clinical trials indicate that Win 19,362 is about twice as potent as morphine as an analgesic but, like nalorphine, is capable of producing severe psychic side effects. Win 20,228 is estimated to be about half as active as morphine as an analgesic, but no bizarre psychic effects were reported at any dose tested. Studies of addiction liability with Win 20,228 in monkeys suggest that this compound will not support morphine addiction."

https://openalex.org/W2081137895,"PLASMA kinin formation1 can be induced by treating plasma in a variety of ways, excluding the addition of proteolytic enzymes. In our present work the procedures which we have applied to ‘pre-active’ human plasma or serum include exposure to a large glass surface2, addition of e-amino-caproic acid or disodium edetate3, dilution4, re-suspension of the 33 per cent saturated ammonium sulphate precipitate, or addition of the purified kinin-forming material isolated from human plasma (Armstrong, D., and Mills, G. L., unpublished work)."

https://openalex.org/W1996308143,"Zonal separation of particles in density gradients contained in hollow or tubeless rotors has been explored with the aim of developing a preparative counterpart of the analytical ultracentrifuge. A rotor with a capacity of 1625 milliliters has been tested up to 22,500 revolutions per minute, with sucrose density gradients used. Excellent separation of subcellular particles has been achieved as well as partial separation of the albumin and globulin peaks of serum."

https://openalex.org/W1992655433,"THE role of zinc in biological systems has been the subject of many investigations during recent years. Addink1 suggested a possible correlation between the zinc content of blood and liver and the presence of cancer. No clear confirmation of this correlation has been obtained. Zinc has been found to be an integral portion of several enzymes by Vallee2. The high levels of zinc present in the prostate, in leucocytes and in sperm have been observed by a number of investigators3. In general, the understanding of the role of zinc in biological systems is still largely reduced to a description of concentration differences rather than of metabolic interactions."

We propose several possible interpretations of the data and point out the possibility that mechanisms of cesium retention may be age-dependent."

https://openalex.org/W2080349714,"IN the course of investigation of some aspects of renal function in adult dairy cattle, it was noted that there was a marked diuretic response to a painful stimulus. The animals used were non-lactating, non-pregnant Ayrshire dairy cows accustomed to experimental procedures, and the stimulus was puncture of the brachial artery by the technique described by Fisher1, which, despite the use of local anæsthetic, always caused some discomfort. Arterial puncture was carried out during continuous urine collection by an indwelling urethral catheter for renal clearance measurements. In association with the increased rate of flow after arterial puncture, urine became noticeably paler in colour, and there was a marked fall in urinary bicarbonate concentration. Cystometric measurement of bladder pressure showed that there was no variation in intracystic pressure at the onset of diuresis, and, on the basis of these observations, it was assumed that the increase in the rate of urine collection was a true reflexion of increased rate of formation, rather than the expulsion of uncollected urine from the bladder."
