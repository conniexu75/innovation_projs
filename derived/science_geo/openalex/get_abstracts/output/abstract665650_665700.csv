https://openalex.org/W3117227522,"Introduction Peru is among the top ten countries with the highest number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases worldwide. The aim of the study was to describe the clinical features of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 and to determine the prognostic factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study among adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to Hospital Cayetano Heredia; a tertiary care hospital in Lima, Peru. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify factors independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Results A total of 369 patients (median age 59 years [IQR:49–68]; 241 (65.31%) male) were included. Most patients (68.56%) reported at least one comorbidity; more frequently: obesity (42.55%), diabetes mellitus (21.95%), and hypertension (21.68%). The median duration of symptoms prior to hospital admission was 7 days (IQR: 5–10). Reported in-hospital mortality was 49.59%. By multiple Cox regression, oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) values of less than 90% on admission correlated with mortality, presenting 1.86 (95%CI: 1.02–3.39), 4.44 (95%CI: 2.46–8.02) and 7.74 (95%CI: 4.54–13.19) times greater risk of death for SaO 2 of 89–85%, 84–80% and &lt;80%, respectively, when compared to patients with SaO 2 &gt;90%. Additionally, age &gt;60 years was associated with 1.88 times greater mortality. Conclusions Oxygen saturation below 90% on admission is a strong predictor of in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. In settings with limited resources, efforts to reduce mortality in COVID-19 should focus on early identification of hypoxemia and timely access to hospital care."
https://openalex.org/W3116817030,"Objective To explore parents’ and guardians’ views and experiences of accessing National Health Service (NHS) general practices for routine childhood vaccinations during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in England. Design Mixed methods approach involving an online cross-sectional survey (conducted between 19 th April and 11 th May 2020) and semi-structured telephone interviews (conducted between 27 th April and 27 th May 2020). Participants 1252 parents and guardians (aged 16+ years) who reported living in England with a child aged 18 months or under completed the survey. Nineteen survey respondents took part in follow-up interviews. Results The majority of survey respondents (85.7%) considered it important for their children to receive routine vaccinations on schedule during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, several barriers to vaccination were identified. These included a lack of clarity around whether vaccination services were operating as usual, particularly amongst respondents from lower income households and those self-reporting as Black, Asian, Chinese, Mixed or Other ethnicity; difficulties in organising vaccination appointments; and fears around contracting COVID-19 while attending general practice. Concerns about catching COVID-19 while accessing general practice were weighed against concerns about children acquiring a vaccine-preventable disease if they did not receive scheduled routine childhood vaccinations. Many parents and guardians felt their child’s risk of acquiring a vaccine-preventable disease was low as the implementation of stringent physical distancing measures (from March 23 rd 2020) meant they were not mixing with others. Conclusion To promote routine childhood vaccination uptake during the current COVID-19 outbreak, further waves of COVID-19 infection, and future pandemics, prompt and sustained national and general practice level communication is needed to raise awareness of vaccination service continuation and the importance of timely vaccination, and invitation-reminder systems for vaccination need to be maintained. To allay concerns about the safety of accessing general practice, practices should communicate the measures being implemented to prevent COVID-19 transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3116446264,"Introduction A large proportion of patients with COVID-19 develop acute kidney injury (AKI). While the most severe of these cases require renal replacement therapy (RRT), little is known about their clinical course. Methods We describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in the ICU with AKI requiring RRT at an academic medical center in New York City and followed patients for outcomes of death and renal recovery using time-to-event analyses. Results Our cohort of 115 patients represented 23% of all ICU admissions at our center, with a peak prevalence of 29%. Patients were followed for a median of 29 days (2542 total patient-RRT-days; median 54 days for survivors). Mechanical ventilation and vasopressor use were common (99% and 84%, respectively), and the median Sequential Organ Function Assessment (SOFA) score was 14. By the end of follow-up 51% died, 41% recovered kidney function (84% of survivors), and 8% still needed RRT (survival probability at 60 days: 0.46 [95% CI: 0.36–0.56])). In an adjusted Cox model, coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were associated with increased mortality (HRs: 3.99 [95% CI 1.46–10.90] and 3.10 [95% CI 1.25–7.66]) as were angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (HR 2.33 [95% CI 1.21–4.47]) and a SOFA score &gt;15 (HR 3.46 [95% CI 1.65–7.25). Conclusions and relevance Our analysis demonstrates the high prevalence of AKI requiring RRT among critically ill patients with COVID-19 and is associated with a high mortality, however, the rate of renal recovery is high among survivors and should inform shared-decision making."
https://openalex.org/W3112441150,"Background Detailed temporal analyses of complete (full) blood count (CBC) parameters, their evolution and relationship to patient age, gender, co-morbidities and management outcomes in survivors and non-survivors with COVID-19 disease, could identify prognostic clinical biomarkers. Methods From 29 January 2020 until 28 March 2020, we performed a longitudinal cohort study of COVID-19 inpatients at the Italian National Institute for Infectious Diseases, Rome, Italy. 9 CBC parameters were studied as continuous variables [neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, platelets, mean platelet volume, red blood cell count, haemoglobin concentration, mean red blood cell volume and red blood cell distribution width (RDW %)]. Model-based punctual estimates, as average of all patients’ values, and differences between survivors and non-survivors, overall, and by co-morbidities, at specific times after symptoms, with relative 95% CI and P-values, were obtained by marginal prediction and ANOVA- style joint tests. All analyses were carried out by STATA 15 statistical package. Main findings 379 COVID-19 patients [273 (72% were male; mean age was 61.67 (SD 15.60)] were enrolled and 1,805 measures per parameter were analysed. Neutrophils’ counts were on average significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors (P&lt;0.001) and lymphocytes were on average higher in survivors (P&lt;0.001). These differences were time dependent. Average platelets’ counts (P&lt;0.001) and median platelets’ volume (P&lt;0.001) were significantly different in survivors and non-survivors. The differences were time dependent and consistent with acute inflammation followed either by recovery or by death. Anaemia with anisocytosis was observed in the later phase of COVID-19 disease in non-survivors only. Mortality was significantly higher in patients with diabetes (OR = 3.28; 95%CI 1.51–7.13; p = 0.005), obesity (OR = 3.89; 95%CI 1.51–10.04; p = 0.010), chronic renal failure (OR = 9.23; 95%CI 3.49–24.36; p = 0.001), COPD (OR = 2.47; 95% IC 1.13–5.43; p = 0.033), cardiovascular diseases (OR = 4.46; 95%CI 2.25–8.86; p = 0.001), and those &gt;60 years (OR = 4.21; 95%CI 1.82–9.77; p = 0.001). Age (OR = 2.59; 95%CI 1.04–6.45; p = 0.042), obesity (OR = 5.13; 95%CI 1.81–14.50; p = 0.002), renal chronic failure (OR = 5.20; 95%CI 1.80–14.97; p = 0.002) and cardiovascular diseases (OR 2.79; 95%CI 1.29–6.03; p = 0.009) were independently associated with poor clinical outcome at 30 days after symptoms’ onset. Interpretation Increased neutrophil counts, reduced lymphocyte counts, increased median platelet volume and anaemia with anisocytosis, are poor prognostic indicators for COVID19, after adjusting for the confounding effect of obesity, chronic renal failure, COPD, cardiovascular diseases and age &gt;60 years."
https://openalex.org/W3116520267,"Background The rapid spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) around the world has caused a global pandemic, infecting millions of individuals, with an unprecedented impact in health care systems worldwide. Healthcare workers are one of the risk groups that need to be well protected, due to their strategic role in patient management, presently and in prevention of healthcare needs for future outbreaks. Here, we present the results of the first SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study in the Northern Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, Spain. Methods IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were analyzed in serum samples from 7563 healthcare workers of the Northern Metropolitan Area of Barcelona. Samples were collected after the first pandemic wave (from May 4th to May 22nd, 2020) and were analyzed by automated chemiluminescence assays. All samples were tested for IgG anti-S1/S2. Participant samples with negative or equivocal results but with analytical signals above the limit of detection and/or previously confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were also tested for IgG anti-Nucleocapsid. Results A total of 779 of 7563 (10.3%) healthcare workers were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (specific for either S1/S2 or N antigens). No significant differences were observed between those working at primary care or at the reference hospital. Interestingly, among 341 participants with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, 36 (10.55%) tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG (both S1/S2 and recombinant N antigen). Conclusion Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in the healthcare workers of the North Metropolitan Area of Barcelona was higher than in the general population in the same geographical area. Safety measures have to be stressed in order to protect these essential workers from future pandemic waves."
https://openalex.org/W3116631662,"Environmental DNA (eDNA) can be used for early detection, population estimations, and assessment of potential spread of invasive species, but questions remain about factors that influence eDNA detection results. Efforts are being made to understand how physical, chemical, and biological factors—settling, resuspension, dispersion, eDNA stability/decay—influence eDNA estimations and potentially population abundance. In a series of field and controlled mesocosm experiments, we examined the detection and accumulation of eDNA in sediment and water and the transport of eDNA in a small stream in the Lake Michigan watershed, using the invasive round goby fish ( Neogobius melanostomus ) as a DNA source. Experiment 1: caged fish (average n = 44) were placed in a stream devoid of round goby; water was collected over 24 hours along 120-m of stream, including a simultaneous sampling event at 7 distances from DNA source; stream monitoring continued for 24 hours after fish were removed. Experiment 2: round goby were placed in laboratory tanks; water and sediment were collected over 14 days and for another 150 days post-fish removal to calculate eDNA shedding and decay rates for water and sediment. For samples from both experiments, DNA was extracted, and qPCR targeted a cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI) fragment specific to round goby. Results indicated that eDNA accumulated and decayed more slowly in sediment than water. In the stream, DNA shedding was markedly lower than calculated in the laboratory, but models indicate eDNA could potentially travel long distances (up to 50 km) under certain circumstances. Collectively, these findings show that the interactive effects of ambient conditions (e.g., eDNA stability and decay, hydrology, settling-resuspension) are important to consider when developing comprehensive models. Results of this study can help resource managers target representative sites downstream of potential invasion sites, thereby maximizing resource use."
https://openalex.org/W3117374507,"Marine phytoplankton, and in particular diatoms, are responsible for almost half of all primary production on Earth. Diatom species thrive from polar to tropical waters and across light environments that are highly complex to relatively benign, and so have evolved highly divergent strategies for regulating light capture and utilization. It is increasingly well established that diatoms have achieved such successful ecosystem dominance by regulating excitation energy available for generating photosynthetic energy via highly flexible light harvesting strategies. However, how different light harvesting strategies and downstream pathways for oxygen production and consumption interact to balance excitation pressure remains unknown. We therefore examined the responses of three diatom taxa adapted to inherently different light climates (estuarine Thalassioisira weissflogii , coastal Thalassiosira pseudonana and oceanic Thalassiosira oceanica ) during transient shifts from a moderate to high growth irradiance (85 to 1200 μmol photons m -2 s -1 ). Transient high light exposure caused T . weissflogii to rapidly downregulate PSII with substantial nonphotochemical quenching, protecting PSII from inactivation or damage, and obviating the need for induction of O 2 consuming (light-dependent respiration, LDR) pathways. In contrast, T . oceanica retained high excitation pressure on PSII, but with little change in RCII photochemical turnover, thereby requiring moderate repair activity and greater reliance on LDR. T . pseudonana exhibited an intermediate response compared to the other two diatom species, exhibiting some downregulation and inactivation of PSII, but high repair of PSII and induction of reversible PSII nonphotochemical quenching, with some LDR. Together, these data demonstrate a range of strategies for balancing light harvesting and utilization across diatom species, which reflect their adaptation to sustain photosynthesis under environments with inherently different light regimes."
https://openalex.org/W3113893184,"Background The early identification of pregnant women at risk of developing complications at birth is fundamental to antenatal care and an important strategy in preventing maternal death. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of high-risk pregnancies and explore the association between risk stratification and severe maternal morbidity. Methods This hospital-based prospective cohort study included 346 pregnant women between 28–32 gestational weeks who were followed up after childbirth at Koshi Hospital in Nepal. The Malaysian antenatal risk stratification approach, which applies four color codes, was used: red and yellow denote high-risk women, while green and white indicate low-risk women based on maternal past and present medical and obstetric risk factors. The World Health Organization criteria were used to identify women with severe maternal morbidity. Multivariate confirmatory logistic regression analysis was performed to adjust for possible confounders (age and mode of birth) and explore the association between risk stratification and severe maternal morbidity. Results The prevalence of high-risk pregnancies was 14.4%. Based on the color-coded risk stratification, 7.5% of the women were categorized red, 6.9% yellow, 72.0% green, and 13.6% white. The women with high-risk pregnancies were 4.2 times more likely to develop severe maternal morbidity conditions during childbirth. Conclusions Although smaller in percentage, the chances of severe maternal morbidity among high-risk pregnancies were higher than those of low-risk pregnancies. This risk scoring approach shows the potential to predict severe maternal morbidity if routine screening is implemented at antenatal care services. Notwithstanding, unpredictable severe maternal morbidity events also occur among low-risk pregnant women, thus all pregnant women require vigilance and quality obstetrics care but high-risk pregnant women require specialized care and referral."
https://openalex.org/W3115506656,"Background To investigate the survival prognostic value of the radiomic features of 18 F-FDG PET in patients who had EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) mutated lung adenocarcinoma and received targeted TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) treatment. Methods Fifty-one patients with stage III-IV lung adenocarcinoma and actionable EGFR mutation who received first-line TKI were retrospectively analyzed. All patients underwent pretreatment 18 F-FDG PET/CT, and we calculated the PET-derived radiomic features. Cox proportional hazard model was used to examine the association between the radiomic features and the survival outcomes, including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). A score model was established according to the independent prognostic predictors and we compared this model to the TNM staging system using Harrell's concordance index (c-index). Results Forty-eight patients (94.1%) experienced disease progression and 41 patients (80.4%) died. Primary tumor SUV entropy &gt; 5.36, and presence of pleural effusion were independently associated with worse OS (both p &lt; 0.001) and PFS ( p = 0.001, and 0.003, respectively). We used these two survival predictors to devise a scoring system (score 0–2). Patients with a score of 1 or 2 had a worse survival than those with a score of 0 (HR for OS: 3.6, p = 0.006 for score 1, and HR: 21.8, p &lt; 0.001 for score 2; HR for PFS: 2.2, p = 0.027 for score 1 and HR: 8.8, p &lt; 0.001 for score 2). Our scoring system surpassed the TNM staging system (c-index = 0.691 versus 0.574, p = 0.013 for OS, and c-index = 0.649 versus 0.517, p = 0.004 for PFS). Conclusions In this preliminary study, combining PET radiomics with clinical risk factors may improve survival stratification in stage III-IV lung adenocarcinoma with actionable EFGR mutation. Our proposed scoring system may assist with optimization of individualized treatment strategies in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W3115650628,"Background Current cardiorespiratory monitoring equipment can cause injuries and infections in neonates with fragile skin. Impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar was recently demonstrated to be an effective contactless vital sign monitor in adults. The purpose of this study was to assess heart rates (HRs) and respiratory rates (RRs) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) using IR-UWB radar and to evaluate its accuracy and reliability compared to conventional electrocardiography (ECG)/impedance pneumography (IPG). Methods The HR and RR were recorded in 34 neonates between 3 and 72 days of age during minimal movement (51 measurements in total) using IR-UWB radar (HR Rd , RR Rd ) and ECG/IPG (HR ECG , RR IPG ) simultaneously. The radar signals were processed in real time using algorithms for neonates. Radar and ECG/IPG measurements were compared using concordance correlation coefficients (CCCs) and Bland-Altman plots. Results From the 34 neonates, 12,530 HR samples and 3,504 RR samples were measured. Both the HR and RR measured using the two methods were highly concordant when the neonates had minimal movements (CCC = 0.95 between the RR Rd and RR IPG , CCC = 0.97 between the HR Rd and HR ECG ). In the Bland-Altman plot, the mean biases were 0.17 breaths/min (95% limit of agreement [LOA] -7.0–7.3) between the RR Rd and RR IPG and -0.23 bpm (95% LOA -5.3–4.8) between the HR Rd and HR ECG . Moreover, the agreement for the HR and RR measurements between the two modalities was consistently high regardless of neonate weight. Conclusions A cardiorespiratory monitor using IR-UWB radar may provide accurate non-contact HR and RR estimates without wires and electrodes for neonates in the NICU."
https://openalex.org/W3116120383,"Background Dislocations of the sternoclavicular joint (anterior/posterior) and acromioclavicular joint (SCJ and ACJ, respectively) are rare injuries in childhood/adolescence, each having its own special characteristics. In posterior SCJ dislocation, the concomitant injuries in the upper mediastinum are most important complication, while in anterior SCJ dislocation there is a risk of permanent or recurrent instability. Methods In a retrospective analysis from seven pediatric trauma centers under the leadership of the Section of Pediatric Traumatology of the German Trauma Society, children (&lt;18 years) were analyzed with focus on age, gender, trauma mechanism, diagnostics, treatment strategy and follow-up results. Additional epidemiological big data analysis from routine data was done. Results In total 24 cases with an average age of 14.4 years (23 boys, 1 girl) could be evaluated (7x ACJ dislocation type ≥ Rockwood III; 17x SCJ dislocation type Allman III, including 12 posterior). All ACJ dislocations were treated surgically. Postoperative immobilization lasted 3–6 weeks, after which a movement limit of 90 degrees was recommended until implant removal. Patients with SCJ dislocation were posterior dislocations in 75%, and 15 of 17 were treated surgically. One patient had a tendency toward sub-dislocation and another had a relapse. Conservatively treated injuries healed without complications. Compared to adults, SCJ injuries were equally rarely found in children (&lt; 1% of clavicle-associated injuries), while pediatric ACJ dislocations were significantly less frequent (p&lt;0.001). Conclusions In cases of SCJ dislocations, our cohort analysis confirmed both the heterogeneous spectrum of the treatment strategies in addition to the problems/complications based on previous literature. The indication for the operative or conservative approach and for the specific method is not standardized. In order to be able to create evidence-based standards, a prospective, multicenter-study with a sufficiently long follow-up time would be necessary due to the rarity of these injuries in children. The rarity was emphasized by our routine data analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3117541877,"Background The incidence of sepsis has been rising overall but updated data in cancer patients are lacking. After a cancer diagnosis, incidence of sepsis and overall mortality peak within the first year. However, how much sepsis contributes to mortality remains unclear. We used a multistate model approach to analyze the incidence, risk factors and associated mortality of sepsis within 1 year of cancer diagnosis in middle aged adults. Methods Analysis of a large US health insurance claims database (Marketscan) between 2005 and 2014. Patients with a new diagnosis of cancer who received chemotherapy were included. Within a year of diagnosis, we assessed inpatient admissions for sepsis based on ICD-9 codes and survival using hospitalizations, outpatient visits and prescriptions filled. Competing risk and multistate models were used to assess the incidence of sepsis and transition probabilities between cancer, sepsis and death. Results 119,379 patients (38.9% males), aged 55 (50–60) years, were included; 2,560 developed isolated sepsis, 477 severe sepsis and 1331 septic shock within 1 year, with associated hospital mortality of 14.8%, 30% and 46% respectively. The probability of sepsis increased between 2005 and 2014; at 1 year, its cumulative incidence was 3.7% with a probability of mortality after sepsis of 35.5% (95% CI 21.6%-50.9%). Age, male gender, Charlson comorbidity index, hematological malignancies and metastases at diagnosis were associated with sepsis and mortality. Conclusions Incidence and mortality of sepsis were 3.7% and 35.5% at 1 year after cancer diagnosis and were both associated with baseline patient and cancer characteristics."

https://openalex.org/W3113887658,"This research examines how rural-to-urban migration influences health through discrimination experience in China after considering migration selection bias. We conducted propensity score matching (PSM) to obtain a matched group of rural residents and rural-to-urban migrants with a similar probability of migrating from rural to urban areas using data from the 2014 China Family Panel Studies (CFPS). Regression and mediation analyses were performed after PSM. The results of regression analysis after PSM indicated that rural-to-urban migrants reported more discrimination experience than rural residents, and those of mediation analysis revealed discrimination experience to exert negative indirect effects on the associations between rural-to-urban migration and three measures of health: self-reported health, psychological distress, and physical discomfort. Sensitivity analysis using different calipers yielded similar results. Relevant policies and practices are required to respond to the unfair treatment and discrimination experienced by this migrant population."
https://openalex.org/W3114797997,"A salient objective feature of the social environment in which people find themselves is group size. Knowledge of group size is highly relevant to behavioural scientists given that humans spend considerable time in social settings and the number of others influences much of human behaviour. What size of group do people actually look for and encounter in everyday life? Here we report four survey studies and one experience-sampling study (total N = 4,398) which provide evidence for the predominance of the dyad in daily life. Relative to larger group sizes, dyads are most common across a wide range of activities (e.g., conversations, projects, holidays, movies, sports, bars) obtained from three time moments (past activities, present, and future activities), sampling both mixed-sex and same-sex groups, with three different methodological approaches (retrospective reports, real-time data capture, and preference measures) in the United States and the Netherlands. We offer four mechanisms that may help explain this finding: reciprocity , coordination , social exclusion , and reproduction . The present findings advance our understanding of how individuals organize themselves in everyday life."
https://openalex.org/W3115027804,"Objective The answer to this article lies in: Does the financial activities of physical enterprises have an adverse impact on their main business? Is it conducive to the sustainable development of the national economy? However, when most scholars study the impact of environmental regulations on companies performance, they have not classified companies performance. This article will study the relationship between environmental regulations and performance levels based on the classification of companies performance, and then divide the nature of industry pollution, companies location and nature of property for in-depth research. Methods First, this article uses a random effect variable-intercept model to measure companies financial performance and non-financial performance. Then, the variables are divided into two variable groups: light pollution and heavy pollution according to the nature of industry pollution. Next, the companies are divided into three variable groups: the eastern region, the central region, and the western region. Finally, the company is divided into two variable groups: state-owned and non-state-owned according to the nature of property. Conclusions The study found that: (1) Environmental regulations have inhibited companies financial activities. And the inhibitory effect of environmental regulations on the financial performance of enterprises is more obvious in the heavily polluting industries and enterprises in central and eastern regions. (2) Environmental regulations and companies non-financial performance are also negatively related, environmental regulations have also inhibited the non-financial performance of companies, this effect is more pronounced in heavily polluting industries and enterprises in western regions. (3) Income crowding effect brought by China's environmental regulations is greater than the income compensation effect brought by stimulating technological innovation."
https://openalex.org/W3115664296,"Background The burden of snakebite remains poorly characterised because of the paucity of population-based data. Further, factors determining the vulnerability of individuals within rural communities to snakebite have been rarely investigated. We undertook a population-based study to determine the prevalence, vulnerability and epidemiological characteristics of snakebite in rural Sri Lanka. Methods and findings A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 8707 current residents in the district of Ampara, representing typical rural Sri Lanka. The sample was recruited using multi-stage cluster sampling with probability proportionate-to-size. Snakebite victims were identified using the WHO criteria. Data were collected using a pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaire. Each household had on average 3.8 persons; mean age 28.3 years (SD = 18.2); 51.3% males. The one-year point prevalence of snakebites was 17.6 per 1000 residents (95% CI: 15–20.6) and 6.12 per 100 households (95% CI: 5.25–7.13), while the lifetime prevalence was 9.4 per 100 residents (95% CI: 8.8–10.0) and 30.5 per 100 households (95% CI: 28.6–32.2) with a case fatality ratio of 0.033. Venomous snakebites accounted for 28.1%; snakes were unidentified among 30.1%. Compared to the non-snakebite victims, being single, males, of Sinhala ethnicity, aged &gt;19 years, low education and socioeconomic status, engaging in farming or unskilled outdoor occupations denoted vulnerability to snakebites. Outdoor bites (77.8%) were more common among males; during daytime; mostly while walking; within the rural terrains and home gardens; on lower limbs; mostly by hump-nosed and Russell viper. Indoor bites were more common among females; during night-time; while sleeping and barefooted; on lower limbs; mostly by hump-nosed vipers, kraits and non-venomous snakes. Conclusions The burden of snakebite is considerably high among rural populations. The concept of vulnerability can be useful in healthcare decision-making and resource allocation."
https://openalex.org/W3117271761,"Background During ischemia a close relationship exists between sub-endocardial blood flow and myocardial function. Strain parameters can capture an impairment of regional longitudinal function but are load dependent. Recently, a novel non-invasive method to calculate Myocardial Work (MW) showed a strong correlation with invasive work measurements. Our aim was to investigate the ability of non-invasive MW indices to identify the ischaemic risk area during transient acute coronary occlusion (TACO). Methods and results The study population comprises 50 individuals with critical coronary stenosis (CCS). Echocardiography recordings were obtained before coronary angiography, during TACO and after revascularization to measure global longitudinal strain (GLS), Myocardial Work Index (MWI), Myocardial Constructive Work (MCW), Myocardial Wasted work (MWW), Myocardial work efficiency (MWE). Compared to baseline, we found a significant reduction of GLS (p = 0.005), MWI, MCW and MWE (p&lt;0.001) during TACO. Conclusions The non-invasive measurement of MW parameters is a sensitive and early marker of myocardial ischemia during TACO."
https://openalex.org/W3117732993,"Background Universal health coverage (UHC) for all people, regardless of citizenship, is a global priority. Health care providers are central to the achievement of UHC, and their attitudes and behaviour could either advance or impede UHC for migrants. Using a social exclusion conceptual framework, this study examined the perspectives of health care providers on delivering health services to migrants in public health facilities in Gauteng Province, South Africa. Methods We used stratified, random sampling to select 13 public health facilities. All health care providers working in ambulatory care were invited to complete a self-administered questionnaire. In addition to socio-demographic information, the questionnaire asked health care providers if they had witnessed discrimination against migrants at work, and measured their perspectives on social exclusionary views and practices. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify predictors of more exclusionary perspectives for each item. Results 277 of 308 health care providers participated in the study–a response rate of 90%. The participants were predominantly female (77.6%) and nurses (51.9%), and had worked for an average of 6.8 years in their facilities. 19.2% of health care providers reported that they had witnessed discrimination against migrants, while 20.0% reported differential treatment of migrant patients. Exclusionary perspectives varied across the different items, and for different provider groups. Enrolled nurses and nursing assistants were significantly more exclusionary on a number of items, while the opposite was found for providers born outside South Africa. For some questions, female providers held more exclusionary perspectives and this was also the case for providers from higher levels of care. Conclusion Health care providers are critical to inclusive UHC. Social exclusionary views or practices must be addressed through enabling health policies; training in culture-sensitivity, ethics and human rights; and advocacy to ensure that health care providers uphold their professional obligations to all patients."
https://openalex.org/W3114017355,"The western blacklegged tick, Ixodes pacificus, an important vector in the western United States of two zoonotic spirochetes: Borrelia burgdorferi (also called Borreliella burgdorferi), causing Lyme disease, and Borrelia miyamotoi, causing a relapsing fever-type illness. Human cases of Lyme disease are well-documented in California, with increased risk in the north coastal areas and western slopes of the Sierra Nevada range. Despite the established presence of B. miyamotoi in the human-biting I. pacificus tick in California, clinical cases with this spirochete have not been well studied. To assess exposure to B. burgdorferi and B. miyamotoi in California, and to address the hypothesis that B. miyamotoi exposure in humans is similar in geographic range to B. burgdorferi, 1,700 blood donor sera from California were tested for antibodies to both pathogens. Sampling was from high endemic and low endemic counties for Lyme disease in California. All sera were screened using the C6 ELISA. All C6 positive and equivocal samples and nine randomly chosen C6 negative samples were further analyzed for B. burgdorferi antibody using IgG western blot and a modified two ELISA test system and for B. miyamotoi antibody using the GlpQ ELISA and B. miyamotoi whole cell sonicate western blot. Of the 1,700 samples tested in series, eight tested positive for antibodies to B. burgdorferi (0.47%, Exact 95% CI: 0.20, 0.93) and two tested positive for antibodies to B. miyamotoi (0.12%, Exact 95% CI: 0.01, 0.42). There was no statistically significant difference in seroprevalence for either pathogen between high and low Lyme disease endemic counties. Our results confirm a low frequency of Lyme disease and an even lower frequency of B. miyamotoi exposure among adult blood donors in California; however, our findings reinforce public health messaging that there is risk of infection by these emerging diseases in the state."
https://openalex.org/W3114644627,"Harmful algal blooms are commonly thought to be dominated by a single genus, but they are not homogenous communities. Current approaches, both molecular and culture-based, often overlook fine-scale variations in community composition that can influence bloom dynamics. We combined homology-based searches (BLASTX) and phylogenetics to distinguish and quantify Microcystis host and phage members across a summer season during a 2014 Microcystis- dominated bloom that occurred in Lake Tai ( Taihu ), China. We found 47 different genotypes of the Microcystis- specific DNA-dependent RNA polymerase ( rpo B), which included several morphospecies. Microcystis flos-aquae and Microcystis wesenbergii accounted for ~86% of total Microcystis transcripts, while the more commonly studied Microcystis aeruginosa only accounted for ~7%. Microcystis genotypes were classified into three temporal groups according to their expression patterns across the course of the bloom: early, constant and late. All Microcystis morphospecies were present in each group, indicating that expression patterns were likely dictated by competition driven by environmental factors, not phylogeny. We identified three primary Microcystis -infecting phages based on the viral terminase, including a novel Siphoviridae phage that may be capable of lysogeny. Within our dataset, Myoviridae phages consistent with those infecting Microcystis in a lytic manner were positively correlated to the early host genotypes, while the Siphoviridae phages were positively correlated to the late host genotypes, when the Myoviridae phages express putative genetic markers for lysogeny. The expression of genes in the microcystin-encoding mcy cassette was estimated using mcyA , which revealed 24 Microcystis- specific genotypes that were negatively correlated to the early host genotypes. Of all environmental factors measured, pH best described the temporal shift in the Microcystis community genotypic composition, promoting hypotheses regarding carbon concentration mechanisms and oxidative stress. Our work expounds on the complexity of HAB events, using a well-studied dataset to highlight the need for increased resolution of community dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W3114666303,"Background Emerging data suggests a possible role for cysteamine as an adjunct treatment for pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis (CF) that continue to be a major clinical challenge. There are no studies investigating the use of cysteamine in pulmonary exacerbations of CF. This exploratory randomized clinical trial was conducted to answer the question: In future pivotal trials of cysteamine as an adjunct treatment in pulmonary exacerbations of CF, which candidate cysteamine dosing regimens should be tested and which are the most appropriate, clinically meaningful outcome measures to employ as endpoints? Methods and findings Multicentre double-blind randomized clinical trial. Adults experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation of CF being treated with standard care that included aminoglycoside therapy were randomized equally to a concomitant 14-day course of placebo, or one of 5 dosing regimens of cysteamine. Outcomes were recorded on days 0, 7, 14 and 21 and included sputum bacterial load and the patient reported outcome measures (PROMs): Chronic Respiratory Infection Symptom Score (CRISS), the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire–Revised (CFQ-R); FEV 1 , blood leukocyte count, and inflammatory markers. Eighty nine participants in fifteen US and EU centres were randomized, 78 completed the 14-day treatment period. Cysteamine had no significant effect on sputum bacterial load, however technical difficulties limited interpretation. The most consistent findings were for cysteamine 450mg twice daily that had effects additional to that observed with placebo, with improved symptoms, CRISS additional 9.85 points (95% CI 0.02, 19.7) p = 0.05, reduced blood leukocyte count by 2.46x10 9 /l (95% CI 0.11, 4.80), p = 0.041 and reduced CRP by geometric mean 2.57 nmol/l (95% CI 0.15, 0.99), p = 0.049. Conclusion In this exploratory study cysteamine appeared to be safe and well-tolerated. Future pivotal trials investigating the utility of cysteamine in pulmonary exacerbations of CF need to include the cysteamine 450mg doses and CRISS and blood leukocyte count as outcome measures.

https://openalex.org/W3117332044,"Anaemia and underweight or overweight/obesity are major public health problems driving maternal and child mortality in low- and middle-income countries. While the burden of these conditions is recognised, the evidence for the co-occurrence of these conditions is fragmented and mixed, especially at the individual level. Further, many studies have focused on families and communities. The different pathways for the occurrence of anaemia and BMI challenges indicate that an individual can potentially live with both conditions and suffer the complications. This study examined the prevalence and factors associated with the co-occurrence of anaemia and BMI challenges among a cohort of women in Ghana. Data from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey were used. The sample size was 4 337 women aged 15–49 years who were not pregnant during the survey. Women who suffered simultaneously from underweight or overweight/obesity and anaemia were considered as having the double burden of malnutrition. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square test and logistic regression in STATA. One-fifth of the participants were overweight (21%), 4% were underweight and about one-tenth were obese (12%). The prevalence of anaemia was 41%. Only one in three women had normal weight and was not anaemic (34%). About 14% of the women experienced the double burden of malnutrition. Being overweight and anaemic (57%) was the most common form of this double burden. Age, marital status, parity, and wealth were t key risk factors associated with the double burden of malnutrition. The findings from this study show that women experience multiple nutritional challenges concurrently and that only a few women had healthy nutritional status. This information is particularly important and can be introduced into health education programmes to help address misconceptions about body weight and health."
https://openalex.org/W3113738370,"Background Lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is associated with greater adiposity and adverse cardiometabolic risk profile. The evidence is inconsistent among South Asian Indians. We aimed to examine associations between 25(OH)D and cardiovascular (CVD) risk markers in a rural and urban cohort from South India. Subjects/Methods In this cross sectional study, 373 individuals (men, n = 205) underwent detailed CVD risk marker assessment including anthropometry [body mass index (BMI), waist, (WC) and hip circumferences (HC)], body composition analysis using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), blood pressure and biochemical analysis (glucose, insulin and lipids). The distribution of CVD risk factors were compared across serum 25(OH)D levels, stratified as deficiency (&lt;20 ng/ml), insufficiency (20 to 29 ng/ml) and normal (≥30 ng/ml) levels. Multiple regression analysis, adjusting for potential confounders, was used to study associations of 25(OH)D with adiposity and cardiometabolic traits. Results The mean and standard deviation (SD) of age, BMI and 25(OH)D levels were 41.4 (1.1) years, 25.5 (4.8) kg/m 2 and 23.4 (10.4) ng/ml respectively. The prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency was 39.9% in this cohort. Individuals in the 25(OH)D deficiency category had significantly higher mean (SD) BMI [26.6 (5.1) kg/m 2 ], waist circumference [89.9 (12.5) cm] and total fat mass [20.6 (7.9) kg] compared with the Vitamin D sufficient group [BMI: 24.0 (4.4); WC 84.7 (12.0); total fat mass: 15.2 (6.8)]. Significantly inverse associations were observed with DXA measured total and regional fat depots with 25(OH)D levels, while anthropometric indices of adiposity showed significant inverse association only in women. After adjusting for total fat mass, no significant associations were observed between 25(OH)D and the cardiometabolic traits. Conclusions Our results confirm that lower 25(OH)D is independently associated with both total and regional adiposity, but not with cardiometabolic traits, in this population."
https://openalex.org/W3114927978,"Human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) is responsible for acute respiratory infections in humans, with clinical and epidemiological relevance in pediatric, elderly, and immunocompromised populations. These features are largely unknown in Córdoba, Argentina and in adults in general. Hence, our goal was to broadly characterize hMPV infection in patients of all ages hospitalized with acute respiratory infections in Córdoba, Argentina, including epidemiology, clinical features and genetic diversity. Nasopharyngeal secretions were obtained from 795 patients during 2011–2013, 621 patients were 0–25 years old and 174 were 26–85 years old. HMPV was assayed by RT-PCR and other respiratory viruses by indirect immunofluorescence. Local strains were identified by sequence analysis. Human Metapneumovirus was detected in 20.3% (161/795) patients, 13.1% as single infections and 7.2% in co-infections, more frequently with Respiratory Syncytial Virus. HMPV circulated during late winter and spring in all age patients, but mainly in children under 4 years old in 71.4% (115/161) and adults between 26 and 59 years old in 12.4% (20/161). The most prevalent diagnosis was mild acute respiratory infection in 59.6% (96/161) and bronchiolitis in 9.3% (15/161). Local strains were clustered within A 2 subtype; they presented 73–100% identities among them, showing a high degree of homology compared to isolations from neighboring countries. We demonstrate that hMPV circulated among all age patients with respiratory infection during 2011–2013 in Córdoba, contributing to the understanding of this virus, its diagnosis and patient handling in local health-care centers."
https://openalex.org/W3116713395,"The Southeast Pacific comprises two Large Marine Ecosystems, the Pacific Central-American Coastal and the Humboldt Current System; and is one of the less well known in the tropical subregions in terms of biodiversity. To address this, we compared DNA barcoding repositories with the marine biodiversity species for the Southeast Pacific. We obtained a checklist of marine species in the Southeast Pacific (i.e. Colombia, Ecuador, Chile, and Peru) from the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) database and compared it with species available at the Barcoding of Life Data System (BOLD) repository. Of the 5504 species records retrieved from OBIS, 42% of them had at least one registered specimen in BOLD (including specimens around the world); however, only 4.5% of records corresponded to publicly available DNA barcodes including specimens collected from a Southeast Pacific country. The low representation of barcoded species does not vary much across the different taxonomic groups or within countries, but we observed an asymmetric distribution of DNA barcoding records for taxonomic groups along the coast, being more abundant for the Humboldt Current System than the Pacific Central-American Coastal. We observed high-level of barcode records with Barcode Index Number (BIN) incongruences, particularly for fishes (Actinopterygii = 30.27% and Elasmobranchii = 24.71%), reflecting taxonomic uncertainties for fishes, whereas for Invertebrates and Mammalia more than 85% of records were classified as data deficient or inadequate procedure for DNA barcoding. DNA barcoding is a powerful tool to study biodiversity, with a great potential to increase the knowledge of the Southeast Pacific marine biodiversity. Our results highlight the critical need for increasing taxonomic sampling effort, the number of trained taxonomic specialists, laboratory facilities, scientific collections, and genetic reference libraries."
https://openalex.org/W3085128655,"In archaeological research, changes in material culture and the evolution of styles are taken as major indicators for socio-cultural transformation. They form the basis for typo-chronological classification and the establishment of phases and periods. Central European Bronze Age material culture from burials reveals changes during the Bronze Age and represents a perfect case study for analyzing phenomena of cultural change and the adoption of innovation in the societies of prehistoric Europe. Our study focuses on the large-scale change in material culture which took place in the second millennium BC and the emergence at the same period of new burial rites: the shift from inhumation burials in flat graves to complex mounds and simple cremation burials. Paul Reinecke was the first to divide the European Bronze Age (EBA) into two phases, Bz A1 and A2. The shift from the first to the second phase has so far been ascribed to technical advances. Our study adopted an innovative approach to quantifying this phenomenon. Through regressive reciprocal averaging and Bayesian analysis of radiocarbon-dated grave contexts located in Switzerland and southern Germany, we modelled chronological changes in the material culture and changes in burial rites in these regions in a probabilistic way. We used kernel density models to summarize radiocarbon dates, with the aim of visualizing cultural changes in the third and second millennium BC. In 2015, Stockhammer et al. cast doubt on the chronological sequence of the Reinecke phases of the EBA on the basis of newly collected radiocarbon dates from southern Germany. Our intervention is a direct response to the results of that study. We fully agree with Stockhammer’s et al. dating of the start of EBA, but propose a markedly different dating of the EBA/MBA transition. Our modelling of radiocarbon data demonstrates a statistically significant typological sequence of phases Bz A1, Bz A2 and Bz B and disproves their postulated chronological overlap. The linking of the archaeological relative-chronological system with absolute dates is of major importance to understanding the temporal dimension of the EBA phases."
https://openalex.org/W3113417043,"Despite the use of front-line anticancer drugs such as paclitaxel for ovarian cancer treatment, mortality rates have remained almost unchanged for the past three decades and the majority of patients will develop recurrent chemoresistant disease which remains largely untreatable. Overcoming chemoresistance or preventing its onset in the first instance remains one of the major challenges for ovarian cancer research. In this study, we demonstrate a key link between senescence and inflammation and how this complex network involving the biomarkers MAD2, TLR4 and MyD88 drives paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer. This was investigated using siRNA knockdown of MAD2, TLR4 and MyD88 in two ovarian cancer cell lines, A2780 and SKOV-3 cells and overexpression of MyD88 in A2780 cells. Interestingly, siRNA knockdown of MAD2 led to a significant increase in TLR4 gene expression, this was coupled with the development of a highly paclitaxel-resistant cell phenotype. Additionally, siRNA knockdown of MAD2 or TLR4 in the serous ovarian cell model OVCAR-3 resulted in a significant increase in TLR4 or MAD2 expression respectively. Microarray analysis of SKOV-3 cells following knockdown of TLR4 or MAD2 highlighted a number of significantly altered biological processes including EMT, complement, coagulation, proliferation and survival, ECM remodelling, olfactory receptor signalling, ErbB signalling, DNA packaging, Insulin-like growth factor signalling, ion transport and alteration of components of the cytoskeleton. Cross comparison of the microarray data sets identified 7 overlapping genes including MMP13, ACTBL2, AMTN, PLXDC2, LYZL1, CCBE1 and CKS2. These results demonstrate an important link between these biomarkers, which to our knowledge has never before been shown in ovarian cancer. In the future, we hope that triaging patients into alterative treatment groups based on the expression of these three biomarkers or therapeutic targeting of the mechanisms they are involved in will lead to improvements in patient outcome and prevent the development of chemoresistance."
https://openalex.org/W3114946400,"The important but difficult choice of vocational trajectory often takes place in college, beginning with majoring in a subject and taking relevant coursework. Of all possible disciplines, pre-medical studies are often not a formally defined major but pursued by a substantial proportion of the college population. Understanding students’ experiences with pre-med coursework is valuable and understudied, as most research on medical education focuses on the later medical school and residency. We examined the pattern and predictors of attrition at various milestones along the pre-med coursework track during college. Using a College Board dataset, we analyzed a sample of 15,442 students spanning 102 institutions who began their post-secondary education in years between 2006 and 2009. We examined whether students fulfilled the required coursework to remain eligible for medical schools at several milestones: 1) one semester of general chemistry, biology, physics, 2) two semesters of general chemistry, biology, physics, 3) one semester of organic chemistry, and 4) either the second semester of organic chemistry or one semester of biochemistry, and predictors of persistence at each milestone. Only 16.5% of students who intended to major in pre-med graduate college with the required coursework for medical schools. Attrition rates are highest initially but drop as students take more advanced courses. Predictors of persistence include academic preparedness before college (e.g., SAT scores, high school GPA) and college performance (e.g., grades in pre-med courses). Students who perform better academically both in high school and in college courses are more likely to remain eligible for medical school."
https://openalex.org/W3115114148,"Background Coping strategies and their efficacy vary greatly in patients suffering from fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Objective We aimed to identify somatic and psychosocial factors that might contribute to different coping strategies and resilience levels in FMS. Subjects and methods Standardized questionnaires were used to assess coping, pain, and psychological variables in a cohort of 156 FMS patients. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) determined gene expression of selected cytokines in white blood cells of 136 FMS patients and 25 healthy controls. Data of skin innervation, functional and structural sensory profiles of peripheral nociceptive nerve fibers of a previous study were included into the statistics. An exploratory factor analysis was used to define variance explaining factors, which were then included into cluster analysis. Results 54.9% of the variance was explained by four factors which we termed (1) affective load, (2) coping, (3) pain, and (4) pro-inflammatory cytokines (p &lt; 0.05). Considering differences in the emerged factors, coping strategies, cytokine profiles, and disability levels, 118 FMS patients could be categorized into four clusters which we named “maladaptive”, “adaptive”, “vulnerable”, and “resilient” (p &lt; 0.05). The adaptive cluster had low scores in disability and in all symptom categories in contrast to the vulnerable cluster, which was characterized by high scores in catastrophizing and disability (p &lt; 0.05). The resilient vs. the maladaptive cluster was characterized by better coping and a less pro-inflammatory cytokine pattern (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion Our data suggest that problem- and emotion-focused coping strategies and an anti-inflammatory cytokine pattern are associated with reduced disability and might promote resilience. Additional personal factors such as low anxiety scores, ability of acceptance, and persistence further favor a resilient phenotype. Individualized therapy should take these factors into account."

Overall, this structured program provided opportunities for feedback from multiple peer and faculty reviewers, increased the participants’ confidence in developing and submitting research proposals, while accommodating a large number of participants."
https://openalex.org/W3118008387,"Background Smoking prevalence in Ireland is falling in all age groups, but e-cigarette use is rising among young people. This qualitative study explores young people’s accounts of e-cigarette use in Ireland. Methods Semi-structured individual (22) and focus group (8) interviews were conducted with 62 young people aged 18–22 years, recruited from a higher-education institution and youth organisations working with early school-leavers across Dublin. All were smokers or ex-smokers; 41 had tried e-cigarettes, 11 continued as dual users. We identified themes using thematic data analysis. Results Three broad themes were identified: incentivising features, disincentivising features, and ambivalent and unsuccessful cessation, named putative smoking cessation. Incentivising features included price, pleasing taste/ flavours, and the possibility of indoor use. Disincentivising features related to adverse health effects (pain, discomfort, sore throat, coughing, headache) and unpleasant physical effects (bad taste, problems resulting from device faults). Other disincentives were over-consumption arising from inability to control intake, ""greater addictiveness"", product taste, and device faults. Putative cessation refers to the conflict between participants' expected use of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation/reduction aid and their observed reality of e-cigarettes’ failure in this regard, with reported outcomes including: failure to quit or reduce; continued or resumed cigarette and/or roll-your-own smoking; dual use of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products; and inability to quit e-cigarettes. Conclusions Participants were sceptical about e-cigarettes’ ""purported relative healthiness"", concerned about addictiveness and potential long-term health consequences, and critically aware of advertising and industry strategies. E-cigarettes were viewed as being less denormalised, in part because they could be used in indoor spaces where smoking is banned in Ireland. Although price, taste, and perceived renormalisation were important motivators for young people's use of e-cigarettes, they wanted to quit smoking. The regulation of e-cigarettes through age restriction of access, licensing of outlets, pricing, point of sale and advertising restrictions as well as through the banning of indoor use should be considered by legislators and tobacco control policymakers."

We investigated the frequency of RNF 213 gene polymorphism and its association with MMD phenotypes in the Indian population. Materials and methods A case-control study for RNF 213 polymorphism involving 65 MMD patients, 75 parents, and 120 controls were performed. A total of 21 SNPs were screened, of which 17 SNPs were monomorphic. Allelic and genotypic frequency of all polymorphic SNPs were assessed and its association with MMD phenotypes was evaluated. Results The median age of symptom onset was 9 (range 2–17) and 37 years (range 20–58) in paediatric and adult patients respectively. A strong association was observed with RNF 213 rs112735431(p.R4810K) and MMD. Out of 65 patients with MMD, five patients carried the homozygous risk AA genotype. None of the healthy controls carried this homozygous mutation. The mutant allele was detected in MMD patients from Tamil Nadu and North eastern states of India ( p = &lt;0.0001). All the patients carrying the mutant allele had an early age of onset ( p = &lt;0.0001), higher incidence of bilateral disease (p = &lt;0.002), positive family history (p = 0.03), higher Suzuki angiographic stage (≥3) (p&lt;0.0006) and recurrent neurological events (ischemic strokes and TIAs) (p = &lt;0.009). Conclusion The homozygous rs112735431(p.R4810K) variant in RNF 213 variant not only predicts the risk for MMD but can also predict the phenotypic variants."
https://openalex.org/W3113414553,"Rodd et al. (2016) report that recreational rowers’ acquisition of sport-related terminology affected their interpretation of words that have both rowing-related and non-rowing-related meanings (e.g., crab ). The extent to which the rowing- and non-rowing-related meanings were accessible to the participants depended on experiential factors, such as how long the participant had been a rower, and how long it had been since they last rowed. We present two experiments that attempt to replicate these findings with another group of hobbyists, namely video game players. Experiment 1 examined the differences in word meaning choice between gamers and non-gamers. Participation in video-gaming lead to participants generating more gaming-related word meanings in a word association task. Experiment 2 further examined the effects of video gaming experience on the lexical representation of gaming-related words. Participants who had spent more years as gamers were more likely to produce gaming-related word meanings in a word association task. The effect of time spent gaming was no longer significant when we took into account whether the participant engaged with video-game related media (such as YouTube channels or gaming-related message boards). This finding helps us to refine our understanding of the results reported by Rodd et al. (2016), suggesting that it may not be the time spent in an activity that affects the interpretation of ambiguous words, but rather the specific exposure to activity-related vocabulary."
https://openalex.org/W3114461006,"Psychosocial chronic stress is a critical risk factor for the development of mood disorders. However, little is known about the consequences of acute stress in the context of chronic stress, and about the related brain responses. In the present study we examined the physio-behavioural effects of a supplementation with a sensory functional food ingredient (FI) containing Citrus sinensis extract (D11399, Phodé, France) in a pig psychosocial chronic stress model. Female pigs underwent a 5- to 6-week stress protocol while receiving daily the FI (FI, n = 10) or a placebo (Sham, n = 10). We performed pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) to study the brain responses to an acute stress (injection of Synacthen ® , a synthetic ACTH-related agonist) and to the FI odour with or without previous chronic supplementation. The olfactory stimulation with the ingredient elicited higher brain responses in FI animals, demonstrating memory retrieval and habituation to the odour. Pharmacological stress with Synacthen injection resulted in an increased activity in several brain regions associated with arousal, associative learning (hippocampus) and cognition (cingulate cortex) in chronically stressed animals. This highlighted the specific impact of acute stress on the brain. These responses were alleviated in animals previously supplemented by the FI during the entire chronic stress exposure. As chronic stress establishes upon the accumulation of acute stress events, any attenuation of the brain responses to acute stress can be interpreted as a beneficial effect, suggesting that FI could be a viable treatment to help individuals coping with repeated stressful events and eventually to reduce chronic stress. This study provides additional evidence on the potential benefits of this FI, of which the long-term consequences in terms of behaviour and physiology need to be further investigated."
https://openalex.org/W3116815335,"Russian wheat aphid (RWA; Diuraphis noxia Kurdjumov) resistance on the 1D chromosome of wheat has been the subject of intensive research. Conversely, the deployment of the Dn4 derived RWA resistant varieties diminished in recent years due to the overcoming of the resistance it imparts in the United States of America. However, this resistance has not been deployed in South Africa despite reports that Dn4 containing genotypes exhibited varying levels of resistance against the South African RWA biotypes. It is possible that there may be certain genetic differences within breeding lines or cultivars that influence the expression of resistance. The aim of this study was to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers associated with resistance to South African RWA biotypes. A panel of thirty-two wheat lines were phenotyped for RWA resistance using four South African RWA biotypes and a total of 181 samples were genotyped using the Illumina 9K SNP wheat chip. A genome wide association study using 7598 polymorphic SNPs showed that the population was clustered into two distinct subpopulations. Twenty-seven marker trait associations (MTA) were identified with an average linkage disequilibrium of 0.38 at 10 Mbp. Four of these markers were highly significant and three correlated with previously reported quantitative trait loci linked to RWA resistance in wheat. Twenty putative genes were annotated using the IWGSC RefSeq, three of which are linked to plant defence responses. This study identified novel chromosomal regions that contribute to RWA resistance and contributes to unravelling the complex genetics that control RWA resistance in wheat."
https://openalex.org/W2953968716,"Many human behaviors are discussed in terms of discrete categories. Quantizing behavior in this fashion may provide important traction for understanding the complexities of human experience, but it also may bias understanding of phenomena and associated mechanisms. One example of this is absolute pitch (AP), which is often treated as a discrete trait that is either present or absent (i.e., with easily identifiable near-perfect “genuine” AP possessors and at-chance non-AP possessors) despite emerging evidence that pitch-labeling ability is not all-or-nothing. We used a large-scale online assessment to test the discrete model of AP, specifically by measuring how intermediate performers related to the typically defined “non-AP” and “genuine AP” populations. Consistent with prior research, individuals who performed at-chance (non-AP) reported beginning musical instruction much later than the near-perfect AP participants, and the highest performers were more likely to speak a tonal language than were the lowest performers (though this effect was not as statistically robust as one would expect from prior research). Critically, however, these developmental factors did not differentiate the near-perfect AP performers from the intermediate AP performers. Gaussian mixture modeling supported the existence of two performance distributions–the first distribution encompassed both the intermediate and near-perfect AP possessors, whereas the second distribution encompassed only the at-chance participants. Overall, these results provide support for conceptualizing intermediate levels of pitch-labeling ability along the same continuum as genuine AP-level pitch labeling ability—in other words, a continuous distribution of AP skill among all above-chance performers rather than discrete categories of ability. Expanding the inclusion criteria for AP makes it possible to test hypotheses about the mechanisms that underlie this ability and relate this ability to more general cognitive mechanisms involved in other abilities."
https://openalex.org/W3113421150,"Climatic and other extreme events threaten the globalized economy, which relies on increasingly complex and specialized supply-chain networks. Disasters generate (i) direct economic losses due to reduced production in the locations where they occur, and (ii) to indirect losses from the supply shortages and demand changes that cascade along the supply chains. Firms can use inventories to reduce their risk of shortages. Since firms are interconnected through the supply chain, the level of inventory hold by one firm influences the risk of shortages of the others. Such interdependencies lead to systemic risks in supply chain networks. We introduce a stylized model of complex supply-chain networks in which firms adjust their inventory to maximize profit. We analyze the resulting risks and inventory patterns using evolutionary game theory. We report the following findings. Inventories significantly reduce disruption cascades and indirect losses at the expense of a moderate increase in direct losses. The more fragmented a supply chain is, the less beneficial it is for individual firms to maintain inventories, resulting in higher systemic risks. One way to mitigate such systemic risks is to prescribe inventory sizes to individual firms—a measure that could, for instance, be fostered by insurers. We found that prescribing firm-specific inventory sizes based on their position in the supply chain mitigates systemic risk more effectively than setting the same inventory requirements for all firms."
https://openalex.org/W3114102865,"Background New challenges in the medical field of the third millennium emphasise the ""humanization of medicine"" leading to a redefinition of doctors’ values, limits and roles. The study aims to assess whether there are different personality dimensions of physicians in relation to their perception of professional values and public expectations. Methods A questionnaire on the perception of professional values and the opinion on work in the medical field, work relationships and public expectations was administered to 374 doctors attending Continuing Medical Education courses. Results Two personality dimensions were identified: the first dimension (which we termed ""Performance Attainment"") is associated preeminently with values of competence, advocacy, confidentiality, spirit of enquiry, integrity, responsibility and commitment; the second dimension (which we called “Personal Involvement”) focuses on concern and compassion. The doctors that have more difficulty accepting judgements on their activity are those who think that “Performance attainment” is less important (β = 6.01; p-value = 0.007). Instead, the doctors who believe “public expectation of the health system” is not high enough, tend to think that “Performance Attainment” is more important (β = -6.08; p-value = 0.024). The less importance is given to the values of ""Personal Involvement"", the less is the doctor’s perception of having a leading role in respect to other health professionals (β = -2.37; p-value = 0.018). Conclusions Our results demonstrate that there are two different attitudes in terms of recognition and selection of the essential values to better practice the medical profession. Whether the doctors attach more importance to one dimension or the other, they do not differ in our analysis for how they answered the questions about relationships with patients, colleagues or family commitments in the questionnaire, even if they work in different areas. This suggests that in our research there is no single personal attitude that characterizes “a good doctor”."
https://openalex.org/W3115132660,"Wind erosion has gained increasing attention as one of the most serious global ecological and environmental threats. Windbreaks are effective at decreasing wind erosion by reducing wind speed to protect crops, livestock, and farmsteads, while providing wildlife habitats. Synthetic shrubs can act as novel windbreaks; however, there is limited knowledge on how their design affects wind speed. This study determined the protective effects (airflow field and sheltering efficiency) based on the design of synthetic shrubs in a wind tunnel. Broom-shaped synthetic shrubs weakened the wind speeds mainly at the middle and upper parts of the shrubs (5–14 cm), while for hemisphere-shaped shrubs this effect was greatest near their bases (below 4 cm) and least in the middle and upper parts (7–14 cm). Spindle-shaped synthetic shrubs provided the best reduction effect in wind range and strength. Moreover, the wind speed reduction ratio decreased with improved wind speeds and ranged from 26.25 cm (between the second and third rows) to 52.5 cm (after the third row). These results provide strong evidence that synthetic shrubs should be considered to decrease wind speed and prevent wind erosion."
https://openalex.org/W3115606196,"Field-based sports require athletes to run sub-maximally over significant distances, often while contending with dynamic perturbations to preferred coordination patterns. The ability to adapt movement to maintain performance under such perturbations appears to be trainable through exposure to task variability, which encourages movement variability. The aim of the present study was to investigate the extent to which various wearable resistance loading magnitudes alter coordination and induce movement variability during running. To investigate this, 14 participants (three female and 11 male) performed 10 sub-maximal velocity shuttle runs with either no weight, 1%, 3%, or 5% of body weight attached to the lower limbs. Sagittal plane lower limb joint kinematics from one complete stride cycle in each run were assessed using functional data analysis techniques, both across the participant group and within-individuals. At the group-level, decreases in ankle plantarflexion following toe-off were evident in the 3% and 5% conditions, while increased knee flexion occurred during weight acceptance in the 5% condition compared with unloaded running. At the individual-level, between-run joint angle profiles varied, with six participants exhibiting increased joint angle variability in one or more loading conditions compared with unloaded running. Loading of 5% decreased between-run ankle joint variability among two individuals, likely in accordance with the need to manage increased system load or the novelty of the task. In terms of joint coordination, the most considerable alterations to coordination occurred in the 5% loading condition at the hip-knee joint pair, however, only a minority of participants exhibited this tendency. Coaches should prescribe wearable resistance individually to perturb preferred coordination patterns and encourage movement variability without loading to the extent that movement options become limited."
https://openalex.org/W3117476796,"Predicting other people’s upcoming action is key to successful social interactions. Previous studies have started to disentangle the various sources of information that action observers exploit, including objects, movements, contextual cues and features regarding the acting person’s identity. We here focus on the role of static and dynamic inter-object spatial relations that change during an action. We designed a virtual reality setup and tested recognition speed for ten different manipulation actions. Importantly, all objects had been abstracted by emulating them with cubes such that participants could not infer an action using object information. Instead, participants had to rely only on the limited information that comes from the changes in the spatial relations between the cubes. In spite of these constraints, participants were able to predict actions in, on average, less than 64% of the action’s duration. Furthermore, we employed a computational model, the so-called enriched Semantic Event Chain (eSEC), which incorporates the information of different types of spatial relations: (a) objects’ touching/untouching, (b) static spatial relations between objects and (c) dynamic spatial relations between objects during an action. Assuming the eSEC as an underlying model, we show, using information theoretical analysis, that humans mostly rely on a mixed-cue strategy when predicting actions. Machine-based action prediction is able to produce faster decisions based on individual cues. We argue that human strategy, though slower, may be particularly beneficial for prediction of natural and more complex actions with more variable or partial sources of information. Our findings contribute to the understanding of how individuals afford inferring observed actions’ goals even before full goal accomplishment, and may open new avenues for building robots for conflict-free human-robot cooperation."
https://openalex.org/W3116114815,"Globally, conservation efforts have moved millions of people out of protected areas since the 1970s, yet quantitative studies on post-resettlement well-being remain a challenge due to poor documentation. Since 2008, the Indian forest department records demographic and financial details at the household level under standardized guidelines for resettlement. Here, we examine the food security of approximately 600 households’ post-resettlement from Kanha National Park (KNP) in central India between 2009 and 2014. We compare food security of resettled households with host community households with a total of 3519 household surveys, conducted over three seasons within one year. We measure food security using food consumption scores (FCSs), coping strategies index (CSI) and household hunger scale (HHS). Food insecurity is widespread in the landscape, with over 80% of households reporting poor or borderline FCSs year-round. Additionally, we recorded food insecurity increases in monsoon for all households regardless of resettlement status. Results indicate that resettled households are comparable to their host community neighbors in FCS and all households use mild coping strategies to combat food insecurity. While widespread, food insecurity in the KNP landscape is not acute with very few (&lt;10) reports of severe hunger (as measured by the HHS). Almost all foods are market bought (&gt;90%) and sometimes supplemented by gathering locally prevalent greens or from kitchen gardens (forest dependency for food was negligible). Accruing assets and diversifying incomes from non-labor avenues would alleviate food insecurity for all households. The patterns of market dependence and food security associated with diversified stable incomes around protected areas is in contrast with many studies but is likely to occur in similar human-dominated landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W3117083344,"Objectives To overcome key knowledge gaps in relation to justice involved and vulnerable young people and their sexual health and to compare this group with their peers from other youth health surveys in Australia to determine the extent of the issues. Methods Young people, aged between 14 and 17 years, who had ever been or were currently involved with the criminal justice system were purposively sampled. The survey was anonymous and delivered using Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI). Results A total of 465 justice involved MeH-JOSH young people, aged between 14 and 17 years, participated in the study: 44% Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander (Indigenous) and 37% not attending school. Of the total valid responses, 76% (n = 348) reported having ever had sex, with sexual initiation at a median age of 14 years. We compared these data with their peers in other Australian surveys and found that young people in our study had a higher engagement in sex and start having sex at a younger age, reporting more sexual partners at all ages. Conclusions The sexual behaviours of young people involved in the justice system in this study suggest they may be at a greater risk for sexually transmissible infections than their age-matched peers in the general population. Policymakers should elevate them to a priority population for targeting sexual health services and health promotion."
https://openalex.org/W3091563897,"Background The global burden of cancer continues to increase largely because of the aging and growth of the world population alongside an increasing adoption of cancer-causing behaviors. Hence, the purpose of this study was to identify determinants of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma cancer among individuals who diagnosed at the Felegehiwot specialized hospital, North West Ethiopia, 2019. Methods An institution-based unmatched case-control study was conducted at the Felegehiwot Specialized hospital from December 2018 up to June 2019. The sample size calculated using the two-population proportion formula. The final sample size was 486, (162 cases and 324 controls). The simple random sampling method was employed to catch up with the estimated samples. The collected data entered into the Epi-data version 3.1 software and analyzed using SPSS version 21 software. Descriptive statistics computed. Simple logistic analysis was run (at 95% CI and p-value &lt; 0.05) to identify the determinants of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Result A total of 486 patients participated. Nearly one-third of the cases and controls were in the age group of 46–60 years. About 90% of cases and 91% of controls were orthodox Christian. Monthly income of ≤28 dollars (AOR = 2. 73, 95%CI: 1. 8, 4.2), male sex (AOR = 1. 8, 95%CI: 1.2, 2.8), ever had chemical exposure, (AOR = 11. 9, 95%CI: 7.6, 18.8), no regular physical exercise (AOR = 15. 5, 95%CI: 5.7, 42.3), and having hypertension [AOR = 0. 03; 95%CI:0.005, 0.2), lung disease (AOR = 0. 2; 95%CI: 0.06, 0.7), and chronic kidney and cardiac diseases (AOR = 0. 06; 95%CI: 0.01, 0.2) were the determinants of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Conclusions The findings in this study suggest that having a low monthly income, being male sex, ever had chemical exposure, not engaged in regular physical exercise, and being diabetic were the determinants of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma."
https://openalex.org/W3114571728,"Plant species models are among the available tools to predict the future of ecosystems threatened by climate change, habitat loss, and degradation. However, they suffer from low to no inclusion of plant dispersal, which is necessary to predict ecosystem evolution. A variety of seed dispersal models have been conceived for anemochorous and zoochorous plant species, but the coupling between vegetation models and seed dispersal processes remains rare. The main challenge in modelling zoochoric dispersal is simulating animal movements in their complex habitat. Recent developments allow straightforward applications of hidden Markov modelling (HMM) to animal movements, which could ease generalizations when modelling zoochoric seed dispersal. We tested the use of HMM to model seed dispersal by an endangered primate in the Brazilian Atlantic forest, to demonstrate its potential simplicity to simulate seed dispersal processes. We also discuss how to adapt it to other species. We collected information on movement, fruit consumption, deposition, and habitat use of Leontopithecus chrysomelas . We analysed daily trajectories using HMM and built a deterministic Model Of Seed Transfer (MOST), which replicated, with good approximation, the primate’s movement and seed deposition patterns as observed in the field. Our results suggest that the dispersal behaviour and short daily-trajectories of L . chrysomelas restrict the species’ role in large-scale forest regeneration, but contribute to the prevalence of resource tree species locally, and potentially maintaining tree diversity by preventing local extinction. However, it may be possible to accurately simulate dispersal in an area, without necessarily quantifying variables that influence movement, if the movement can be broken down to step-length and turning angles, and parametrised along with the distribution of gut-transit times. For future objectives, coupling MOST with a DVM could be used to test hypotheses on tree species survival in various scenarios, simulating regeneration and growth at regional scales by including data on main dispersal agents over the area of interest, distribution of tree species, and land use data. The principal advantage of the MOST model is its functionality with data available from the literature as the variables are easy to parametrise. We suggest using the coupled model to perform experiments using only available information, but varying the numbers and species of seed dispersers, or modifying land cover or configuration to test for possible thresholds preventing the extinction of selected tree species."
https://openalex.org/W3114852907,"Microfluidic technologies have enormous potential to offer breakthrough solutions across a wide range of applications. However, the rate of scale-up and commercialization of these technologies has lagged significantly behind promising breakthrough developments in the lab, due at least in part to the problems presented by transitioning from benchtop fabrication methods to mass-manufacturing. In this work, we develop and validate a method to create functional microfluidic prototype devices using 3D printed masters in an industrial-scale roll-to-roll continuous casting process. There were no significant difference in mixing performance between the roll-to-roll cast devices and the PDMS controls in fluidic mixing tests. Furthermore, the casting process provided information on the suitability of the prototype microfluidic patterns for scale-up. This work represents an important step in the realization of high-volume prototyping and manufacturing of microfluidic patterns for use across a broad range of applications."
https://openalex.org/W3115473002,"Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of an experiential learning program based on Kolb’s theory in increasing dementia supporters’ motivation and activity involvement within the community. Method In this interventional study, the sample was divided into two groups. The intervention group underwent dementia supporter training and participated in an experiential learning program, which was conducted two weeks after the initial training session. The control group underwent only the dementia supporter training. Results Kolb’s experiential learning model consists of four stages: concrete experience, reflective observation, conceptualization, and active experimentation. A total of 37 and 44 individuals constituted the intervention and control groups, respectively. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed that there was a significant increase in motivation among the intervention group participants, when compared to the control group participants. Moreover, the activity rate was higher among the intervention group participants. Discussion The experiential learning program was effective in increasing motivation levels and activity involvement among the dementia supporters. Conclusions The experiential learning program for dementia supporters can be used to improve other volunteer and professional programs. Moreover, Kolb’s theory can be used to support individuals with dementia within the community."
https://openalex.org/W3115908331,"Ischemia-reperfusion injury is an important contributor to acute kidney injury and a major factor affecting early functional recovery after kidney transplantation. We conducted this experiment to investigate the protective effect of induced multipotent stem cell transplantation on renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Forty rabbits were divided into four groups of 10 rabbits each. Thirty rabbits were used to establish the renal ischemia-reperfusion injury model, and ten rabbits served as the model group and were not treated. Among the 30 rabbits with renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, 10 rabbits were treated with induced peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and 10 other rabbits were treated with noninduced PBMCs. After three weekly treatments, the serum creatinine levels, urea nitrogen levels and urine protein concentrations were quantified. The kidneys were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE), periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Masson’s trichrome and then sent for commercial metabolomic testing. The kidneys of the rabbits in the model group showed different degrees of pathological changes, and the recovery of renal function was observed in the group treated with induced cells. The results indicate that PBMCs differentiate into multipotent stem cells after induction and exert a therapeutic effect on renal ischemia-reperfusion injury."

In Korea, Plasmodium vivax malaria is an endemic disease and the main vector is Anopheles sinensis . Plasmodium vivax malaria is common in the northwestern part of South Korea, including in the city of Goyang in regions near the demilitarized zone. This study aimed to identify the best time-series model for predicting mosquito average abundance in Goyang, Korea. Mosquito data were obtained from the Mosquito Surveillance Program of the Goyang Ilsanseogu Public Health Center for the period 2008–2012. Black light traps were set up periodically in a park, a senior community center, and a village community center, public health center, drainage pumping station, cactus research center, restaurant near forest, in which many activities occur at night. In total, 9,512 female mosquitoes were collected at 12 permanent trapping sites during the mosquito season in the study period. Weekly An . sinensis average abundance was positively correlated with minimum grass temperature ( r = 0.694, p &lt; 0.001), precipitation ( r = 0.326, p = 0.001). The results showed that seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) (1,0,0)(0,0,1) 21 with minimum grass temperature variable at time lag0 weeks and the precipitation variable at time lag1 weeks provided that best model of mosquito average abundance. The multivariate model accounted for about 54.1% of the mosquito average abundance variation. Time-series analysis of mosquito average abundance and climate factors provided basic information for predicting the occurrence of malaria mosquitoes."
