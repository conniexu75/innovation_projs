https://openalex.org/W3101846945,"Neurons are frequently classified into distinct types on the basis of structural, physiological, or genetic attributes. To better constrain the definition of neuronal cell types, we characterized the transcriptomes and intrinsic physiological properties of over 4,200 mouse visual cortical GABAergic interneurons and reconstructed the local morphologies of 517 of those neurons. We find that most transcriptomic types (t-types) occupy specific laminar positions within visual cortex, and, for most types, the cells mapping to a t-type exhibit consistent electrophysiological and morphological properties. These properties display both discrete and continuous variation among t-types. Through multimodal integrated analysis, we define 28 met-types that have congruent morphological, electrophysiological, and transcriptomic properties and robust mutual predictability. We identify layer-specific axon innervation pattern as a defining feature distinguishing different met-types. These met-types represent a unified definition of cortical GABAergic interneuron types, providing a systematic framework to capture existing knowledge and bridge future analyses across different modalities."

Parallel to research focused on risk factors, it could be useful to investigate the factors that help to cope with such crises at an emotional level. Therefore, this study aimed to strengthen the role of variables that protect from subjective distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, explore the pathways between satisfaction with life and perceived stress, and consider the role of coping strategies and defense mechanisms in this relationship. A sample of 1102 Italian participants who were experiencing the COVID-19 lockdown measures (Mage = 34.91, SD = 11.91) completed an online survey in which the Ten Item Perceived Stress Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory and Forty-Item Defense Style Questionnaire were included. The data were analyzed using Pearson’s r correlations and moderation analysis. A chained-mediation model showed that the relationship between life satisfaction and perceived stress is partially mediated by approach coping, positive attitude and mature defenses. This study contributes toward gaining a better understanding of a protective pathway for mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings could be useful from both a preventive and an intervention perspective."

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins are involved in virtually all processes governing the fate of cells and organisms. By altering the chemical state of proteins dynamically, they enormously expand the functional repertoire of the proteome (Walsh et al., 2005Walsh C.T. Garneau-Tsodikova S. Gatto Jr., G.J. Protein posttranslational modifications: the chemistry of proteome diversifications.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2005; 44: 7342-7372Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability to study PTMs at the molecular level is essential for understanding the dynamics of proteins. For most well-studied PTMs, chemical methods, starting with peptide synthesis (Kent, 1988Kent S.B. Chemical synthesis of peptides and proteins.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 957-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), have fostered the growth of an ecosystem of approaches and reagents instrumental in elucidating many signaling pathways over the years (Hattori and Koide, 2018Hattori T. Koide S. Next-generation antibodies for post-translational modifications.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2018; 51: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This has remained a challenge for other important, but more complex PTMs, especially protein adenosine diphosphate-ribosylation (ADPr) and glycosylation. ADPr is a versatile PTM that has critical roles in many physiological and pathological processes, from bacterial pathogenesis, including unconventional ubiquitination by Legionella (Bhogaraju et al., 2016Bhogaraju S.

Derived from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), ADP-ribose is added to different amino acids on target proteins by the action of various transferases, including the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase family (PARPs). While the majority of these enzymes conjugate mono-ADPr (Vyas et al., 2014Vyas S. Matic I. Uchima L. Rood J. Zaja R. Hay R.T. Ahel I. Chang P.

PARP1 activity is limited to mono-ADPr if this residue is mutated (E988Q) (Marsischky et al., 1995Marsischky G.T. Wilson B.A. Collier R.J.

Not only is PARP1 itself biomedically important, but the significance of the ADPr erasers poly-ADPr glycohydrolase (PARG) and ADP-ribosylhydrolase 3 (ARH3) in human health and disease is also becoming increasingly evident. PARG has become a target for modern chemotherapeutic approaches (James et al., 2016James D.I. Smith K.M. Jordan A.M. Fairweather E.E. Griffiths L.A. Hamilton N.S. Hitchin J.R. Hutton C.P. Jones S.

PARG degrades poly-ADPr but cannot cleave the terminal protein-ribose bond (Slade et al., 2011Slade D. Dunstan M.S. Barkauskaite E. Weston R. Lafite P. Dixon N. Ahel M. Leys D. Ahel I.

In contrast, ARH3 has a broader target spectrum including OAADPr, Ser-ADPr, as well as poly-ADPr (Abplanalp et al., 2017Abplanalp J. Leutert M. Frugier E. Nowak K. Feurer R. Kato J. Kistemaker H.V.A.

Serine is the major residue for ADP-ribosylation upon DNA damage.eLife. 2018; 7: e34334Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although the biological and clinical significance of ADPr is well established, the molecular bases by which ADPr exerts its functions have been difficult to determine (Crawford et al., 2018Crawford K. Bonfiglio J.J. Mikoč A. Matic I. Ahel I. Specificity of reversible ADP-ribosylation and regulation of cellular processes.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2018; 53: 64-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This knowledge gap is due to the chemical nature of ADPr, which has hampered development of essential research tools despite considerable effort. The introduction of pan- and mono-ADPr reagents based on protein domains was an important advance (Gibson et al., 2017Gibson B.A. Conrad L.B. Huang D. Kraus W.L. Generation and Characterization of Recombinant Antibody-like ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins.Biochemistry. 2017; 56: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and a recent method based on techniques for studying DNA and RNA elegantly facilitates detection and enrichment of ADPr targets (Ando et al., 2019Ando Y. Elkayam E. McPherson R.L. Dasovich M. Cheng S.J. Voorneveld J. Filippov D.V. Ong S.E. Joshua-Tor L. Leung A.K.L. ELTA: Enzymatic Labeling of Terminal ADP-Ribose.Mol. Cell. 2019; 73: 845-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Yet, despite these successes, the standard toolkit for PTM research, including expandable collections of precisely modified peptides and site-specific antibodies, is still missing for ADPr. Strikingly, over half a century of ADPr research has failed to generate site-specific antibodies (Lüscher et al., 2018Lüscher B. Bütepage M. Eckei L. Krieg S. Verheugd P. Shilton B.H. ADP-Ribosylation, a Multifaceted Posttranslational Modification Involved in the Control of Cell Physiology in Health and Disease.Chem. Rev. 2018; 118: 1092-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, a straightforward and versatile platform for generating precisely ADP-ribosylated peptides and diverse antibodies to ADPr should be broadly useful for elucidating the role of this long-elusive PTM in a variety of biological processes, opening previously inaccessible avenues of research. Synthetic peptides carrying PTMs are not only important tools on their own but also the basis for developing other essential reagents, such as antibodies. While routine for phosphorylation and most other small PTMs, chemical synthesis of ADP-ribosylated peptides is very challenging due to the chemical nature of this PTM (Chuh et al., 2016Chuh K.N. Batt A.R. Pratt M.R. Chemical Methods for Encoding and Decoding of Posttranslational Modifications.Cell Chem. Biol. 2016; 23: 86-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar; Lüscher et al., 2018Lüscher B. Bütepage M. Eckei L. Krieg S. Verheugd P. Shilton B.H. ADP-Ribosylation, a Multifaceted Posttranslational Modification Involved in the Control of Cell Physiology in Health and Disease.Chem. Rev. 2018; 118: 1092-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The problem lies not only in the need to combine methodologies from carbohydrate, nucleic acid, and peptide chemistries, whose elements are sometimes incompatible, but also in the difficulty of introducing pyrophosphate bonds (Liu et al., 2019Liu Q. van der Marel G.A. Filippov D.V. Chemical ADP-ribosylation: mono-ADPr-peptides and oligo-ADP-ribose.Org. Biomol. Chem. 2019; 17: 5460-5474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heroic peptide chemistry efforts have overcome some of these issues and provided a few, mainly unnatural, ADP-ribosylated peptides (Moyle and Muir, 2010Moyle P.M. Muir T.W. Method for the synthesis of mono-ADP-ribose conjugated peptides.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 15878-15880Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar; van der Heden van Noort et al., 2010van der Heden van Noort G.J. van der Horst M.G. Overkleeft H.S. van der Marel G.A.

Synthetic α- and β-Ser-ADP-ribosylated Peptides Reveal α-Ser-ADPr as the Native Epimer.Org. Lett. 2018; 20: 4140-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Yet despite their sophistication, none of these current approaches can produce multiple authentic ADP-ribosylated peptides in scalable amounts and high purity, leaving researchers with no site-specific antibodies. Enzymatic ADPr could, in principle, provide an effective alternative to chemical methods. Many enzymes that conjugate PTMs in cells are routinely expressed as recombinant proteins, but enzymes rarely install PTMs to completion and site-specifically in vitro (Barber and Rinehart, 2018Barber K.W. Rinehart J. The ABCs of PTMs.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2018; 14: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar; Chin, 2017Chin J.W.

Phanumartwiwath A. et al.Posttranslational mutagenesis: A chemical strategy for exploring protein side-chain diversity.Science. 2016; 354: aag1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Enzymatic modification of multiple sites within the same substrate is particularly problematic for many applications, such as generation of site-specific antibodies, which is the reason why chemical peptide synthesis is usually preferred (Barber and Rinehart, 2018Barber K.W. Rinehart J. The ABCs of PTMs.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2018; 14: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar; Chin, 2017Chin J.W. Expanding and reprogramming the genetic code.Nature. 2017; 550: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Although chemical methods are also often prone to off-target reactions, reaction selectivity is achieved through the use of protecting groups (Isidro-Llobet et al., 2009Isidro-Llobet A. Alvarez M. Albericio F. Amino acid-protecting groups.Chem. Rev. 2009; 109: 2455-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Here, we apply this organic synthesis principle to a system based on a PTM writer, while keeping the methods for introducing and removing the protecting groups within the reach of most laboratories. A good protecting group is easily and selectively introduced, compatible with all the reaction steps and capable of being selectively removed. In cells, different PTMs compete for modification of the same residues (Hunter, 2007Hunter T. The age of crosstalk: phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and beyond.Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 730-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), such as ubiquitination and acetylation for lysine (Danielsen et al., 2011Danielsen J.M.R. Sylvestersen K.B. Bekker-Jensen S. Szklarczyk D. Poulsen J.W. Horn H. Jensen L.J. Mailand N. Nielsen M.L. Mass spectrometric analysis of lysine ubiquitylation reveals promiscuity at site level.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2011; 10: 003590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation for serine and threonine (Hart et al., 2007Hart G.W. Housley M.P. Slawson C. Cycling of O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine on nucleocytoplasmic proteins.Nature. 2007; 446: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). We reasoned that we could use one PTM as a protecting group to guide the writer of another and then use the eraser of the first for mild, selective deprotection. This concept is particularly appealing if means for both site-specific installation and enzymatic removal of the competing PTM are easily available, as is true for phosphorylation. Both synthetic phosphopeptides (as protected precursors for modification) and efficient phosphatases (for selective and complete deprotection) are easily obtained. Thus, well-established tools for phosphorylation serve as our basis for expanding the toolbox toward ADPr, a more challenging PTM. We present a three-step chemical biology strategy for efficient and scalable generation of pure Ser-ADP-ribosylated peptides (Figure 1A). (1) First, a peptide precursor is chemically synthesized with phosphoserines replacing the serines that are not to be ADP-ribosylated. (2) Next, authentic ADP-ribose is enzymatically attached to the desired residue. (3) Finally, the native nature of the peptide is restored by enzymatic removal of all the phosphate(s) protecting the off-target serines. To create an efficient biocatalytic tool for fast, scalable generation of pure mono-ADP-ribosylated peptides, we started with the PARP-1/HPF1 complex (Gibbs-Seymour et al., 2016Gibbs-Seymour I. Fontana P. Rack J.G.M. Ahel I. HPF1/C4orf27 Is a PARP-1-Interacting Protein that Regulates PARP-1 ADP-Ribosylation Activity.Mol.

Ahel D. et al.HPF1 completes the PARP active site for DNA damage-induced ADP-ribosylation.Nature. 2020; 579: 598-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), responsible for Ser-ADPr (Bonfiglio et al., 2017Bonfiglio J.J.

Cell. 2017; 65: 932-940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Since mixtures of unmodified, singly and multiply ADP-ribosylated peptides from in vitro reactions have limited utility for most applications, including antibody development, we have developed a strategy characterized not only by an efficient, controlled reaction, but also by purity of the final mono-ADP-ribosylated peptide. Initially, we focused on histone peptides with a single serine, monitoring reactions with our inverted-polarity peptide visualization (Bartlett et al., 2018Bartlett E. Bonfiglio J.J. Prokhorova E.

Biol. 2016; 12: 998-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although we and others have shown that the recombinant HPF1/PARP1 complex can ADP-ribosylate a variety of substrates in vitro (Bartlett et al., 2018Bartlett E. Bonfiglio J.J. Prokhorova E. Colby T.

Acetylation blocks DNA damage-induced chromatin ADP-ribosylation.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2018; 14: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), our first attempts at complete and consistent peptide modification were unsuccessful. For instance, while we were able to completely ADP-ribosylate an H3 peptide (Figure S1A), the initial reaction conditions led to only limited modification of an H2B peptide (Figure S1B). By systematically optimizing reaction conditions (Figures 1B, S1C, and S1D), we increased the reaction efficiency. We then used PARG to ensure that each target serine is modified by only one molecule of ADP-ribose (Figure S1E). This yielded over 5 mg of pure mono-ADP-ribosylated H3 peptide in 2 days, demonstrating the scalability of our approach (Figure S1F). Yet, despite optimization, generation of 100% ADP-ribosylated H2B peptide remained elusive (Figure S1G). After testing different methods, we found boronate-affinity chromatography (Liu and Scouten, 2000Liu X.C. Scouten W.H. Boronate affinity chromatography.Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 147: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) to be a straightforward step to ensure purity of the modified peptide when unmodified precursor is observed in the product mixture (Figures 1C and S1H), and the intact enzymes (PARP1 and HPF1) are effectively trapped by purifying the reaction mixture over C18 StageTips eluted with low acetonitrile (15%) (Figures S1I and S1J). As a whole, this constitutes a robust system based on recombinant wild-type (WT) HPF1/PARP1 and PARG for scalable preparation and quality control of pure native mono-ADP-ribosylated peptides (Figure 1D). To extend our approach to peptides with multiple serines, we needed a strategy to direct modification to only desired serine residues. Despite the striking residue-specificity of HPF1/PARP1 observed for peptides with one serine (Figure S2A), the presence of additional serines results in non-selective reactions, yielding a diverse mixture of species ADP-ribosylated at different positions (Figures S2B–S2D), posing a major problem for antibody generation and other applications. To control the site of ADPr precisely, we reasoned that phosphate as a protecting group could prevent ADPr of off-target serines while permitting modification of unprotected ones. Although ADPr of phosphate groups is seen on DNA and RNA (Munnur et al., 2019Munnur D. Bartlett E. Mikolčević P. Kirby I.T. Rack J.G.M. Mikoč A. Cohen M.S. Ahel I.

Importantly, here we demonstrate that phosphoserine peptides only get ADP-ribosylated when they have additional unphosphorylated serines (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2E), suggesting that phosphate acts as a protecting group guiding the reaction. As shown by MS, ADPr of a PARP1S507ph peptide results in a doubly modified intermediate (S499adpr S507ph) (Figure 2C), demonstrating that phosphoserines allow ADPr of nearby target serines. S504 does not need to be protected because it is not targeted by PARP1/HPF1, as shown previously (Bonfiglio et al., 2017Bonfiglio J.J. Fontana P. Zhang Q. Colby T. Gibbs-Seymour I. Atanassov I.

To deprotect the off-target serines following ADPr, we used Lambda phosphatase, which completely dephosphorylates all phosphoserines while preserving ADPr (Figures 1A, 2A, and S2E).

https://openalex.org/W3102740149,"Inertial measurement units (IMUs) have been increasingly popular in rehabilitation research. However, despite their accessibility and potential advantages, their uptake and acceptance by health professionals remain a big challenge. The development of an IMU-based clinical tool must bring together engineers, researchers and clinicians. This study is part of a developmental process with the investigation of clinicians’ perspectives about IMUs. Clinicians from four rehabilitation centers were invited to a 30-minute presentation on IMUs. Then, two one-hour focus groups were conducted with volunteer clinicians in each rehabilitation center on: 1) IMUs and their clinical usefulness, and 2) IMUs data analysis and visualization interface. Fifteen clinicians took part in the first focus groups. They expressed their thoughts on: 1) categories of variables that would be useful to measure with IMUs in clinical practice, and 2) desired characteristics of the IMUs. Twenty-three clinicians participated to the second focus groups, discussing: 1) functionalities, 2) display options, 3) clinical data reported and associated information, and 4) data collection duration. Potential influence of IMUs on clinical practice and added value were discussed in both focus groups. Clinicians expressed positive opinions about the use of IMUs, but their expectations were high before considering using IMUs in their practice."
https://openalex.org/W3101813394,"The generation of functional genomics datasets is surging, because they provide insight into gene regulation and organismal phenotypes (e.g., genes upregulated in cancer). The intent behind functional genomics experiments is not necessarily to study genetic variants, yet they pose privacy concerns due to their use of next-generation sequencing. Moreover, there is a great incentive to broadly share raw reads for better statistical power and general research reproducibility. Thus, we need new modes of sharing beyond traditional controlled-access models. Here, we develop a data-sanitization procedure allowing raw functional genomics reads to be shared while minimizing privacy leakage, enabling principled privacy-utility trade-offs. Our protocol works with traditional Illumina-based assays and newer technologies such as 10x single-cell RNA sequencing. It involves quantifying the privacy leakage in reads by statistically linking study participants to known individuals. We carried out these linkages using data from highly accurate reference genomes and more realistic environmental samples."
https://openalex.org/W3104477471,"Background Sepsis is one of the major causes of neonatal death worldwide as well as in Bangladesh. The objective of the present study was to identify the risk factors and causative organisms of neonatal sepsis after delivery in a tertiary care hospital, Bangladesh. Methods This was a case-control study conducted in the neonatal ward of Rajshahi Medical College Hospital (RMCH), a 1000-bed tertiary hospital situated in Rajshahi, Bangladesh. Neonates diagnosed as neonatal sepsis by clinical and laboratory parameters were included as cases in this study. Admitted neonates unsuspected or undiagnosed for sepsis were considered as controls. Maternal and neonatal information and their laboratory reports were collected and analyzed. Both bivariate and multiple logistic regression models were used to identify the risk factors of neonatal sepsis. Results A total of 91 cases and 193 controls were included in the study. Maternal history of urinary tract infection (UTI) during the third trimester of pregnancy (aOR 2.75, 95% CI: 1.04–7.23, p &lt;0.05), premature birth (aOR 2.77, 95% CI: 1.08–7.13, p &lt;0.05) and APGAR score &lt;7 at five minutes (aOR 2.58, 95% CI: 1.04–6.39, p &lt;0.05) were associated with onset of neonatal sepsis in multiple logistic regression model. All these factors were also associated with developing early-onset neonatal sepsis, while maternal UTI and male sex of neonates were associated with developing late-onset neonatal sepsis. Escherichia coli (40.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (27.5%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (18.7%) were the commonly isolated organisms causing neonatal sepsis. All these organisms were highly resistant to common antibiotics like amoxicillin, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and quinolones. Carbapenemase group of drugs along with amikacin, nitrofurantoin and linezolid were the most sensitive drugs. Conclusions Strengthening the existing facility for antenatal screening for early diagnosis and treatment of maternal infection during pregnancy as well as identifying high-risk pregnancy for adequate perinatal management is necessary to prevent neonatal sepsis-related morbidity and mortality. Rational use of antibiotics according to local epidemiology and culture and sensitivity reports may minimize the increasing hazards of antibiotic resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3101437579,"Background Many studies have investigated the prognosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); however, most studies had a relatively short follow-up. To elucidate the long-term outcome of NAFLD, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD. Methods We re-evaluated 6080 patients who underwent liver biopsy from 1975 to 2012 and identified NAFLD patients without other etiologies. With follow-up these patients, we evaluated the outcome-associated factors. Results A total of 223 patients were enrolled, 167 (74.9%) was non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The median follow-up was 19.5 (0.5–41.0) years and 4248.3 person-years. The risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension was 11.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.70–15.6) and 7.99 (95% CI 6.09–10.5) times higher, respectively, in NAFLD patients than in the general population. Twenty-three patients died, 22 of whom had NASH. Major causes of death were extrahepatic malignancy and cardiovascular disease (21.7%) followed by liver-related mortality (13.0%). All-cause mortality was significantly higher in NASH patients than in nonalcoholic fatty liver patients (P = 0.041). In multivariate analysis, older age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.09 [95% CI 1.05–1.14], P&lt;0.001) and T2DM (HR 2.87 [95% CI 1.12–7.04], P = 0.021) were significantly associated with all-cause mortality. The factors significantly associated with liver-related events were older age, T2DM, milder hepatic steatosis, and advanced liver fibrosis. Body mass index wasn’t associated with either mortality or liver-related events. Conclusions T2DM was highly prevalent in NAFLD patients and was significantly associated with both all-cause mortality and liver-related events. The lean patients’ prognosis wasn’t necessarily better than that of overweight patients."
https://openalex.org/W3101473234,"Heat waves are known for their disastrous mass die-off effects due to dehydration and cell damage, but little is known about the non-lethal consequences of surviving severe heat exposure. Severe heat exposure can cause oxidative stress which can have negative consequences on animal cognition, reproduction and life expectancy. We investigated the current oxidative stress experienced by a mesic mouse species, the four striped field mouse, Rhabdomys dilectus through a heat wave simulation with ad lib water and a more severe temperature exposure with minimal water. Wild four striped field mice were caught between 2017 and 2019. We predicted that wild four striped field mice in the heat wave simulation would show less susceptibility to oxidative stress as compared to a more severe heat stress which is likely to occur in the future. Oxidative stress was determined in the liver, kidney and brain using malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC) as markers for oxidative damage, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) as markers of antioxidant defense. Incubator heat stress was brought about by increasing the body temperatures of animals to 39–40.8°C for 6 hours. A heat wave (one hot day, followed by a 3-day heatwave) was simulated by using temperature cycle that wild four striped field mice would experience in their local habitat (determined through weather station data using temperature and humidity), with maximal ambient temperature of 39°C. The liver and kidney demonstrated no changes in the simulated heat wave, but the liver had significantly higher SOD activity and the kidney had significantly higher lipid peroxidation in the incubator experiment. Dehydration significantly contributed to the increase of these markers, as is evident from the decrease in body mass after the experiment. The brain only showed significantly higher lipid peroxidation following the simulated heat wave with no significant changes following the incubator experiment. The significant increase in lipid peroxidation was not correlated to body mass after the experiment. The magnitude and duration of heat stress, in conjunction with dehydration, played a critical role in the oxidative stress experienced by each tissue, with the results demonstrating the importance of measuring multiple tissues to determine the physiological state of an animal. Current heat waves in this species have the potential of causing oxidative stress in the brain with future heat waves to possibly stress the kidney and liver depending on the hydration state of animals."
https://openalex.org/W3098057089,"The concept of successional trajectories describes how small differences in initial community composition can magnify through time and lead to significant differences in mature communities. For many animals, the types and sources of early-life exposures to microbes have been shown to have significant and long-lasting effects on the community structure and/or function of the microbiome. In modern commercial poultry production, chicks are reared as a single age cohort and do not directly encounter adult birds. This scenario is likely to initiate a trajectory of microbial community development that is significantly different than non-industrial settings where chicks are exposed to a much broader range of environmental and fecal inocula; however, the comparative effects of these two scenarios on microbiome development and function remain largely unknown. In this work, we performed serial transfers of cecal material through multiple generations of birds to first determine if serial transfers exploiting the ceca in vivo , rather than the external environment or artificial incubations, can produce a stable microbial community. Subsequently, we compared microbiome development between chicks receiving this passaged, i . e . host-selected, cecal material orally, versus an environmental inoculum, to test the hypothesis that the first exposure of newly hatched chicks to microbes determines early GI microbiome structure and may have longer-lasting effects on bird health and development. Cecal microbiome dynamics and bird weights were tracked for a two-week period, with half of the birds in each treatment group exposed to a pathogen challenge at 7 days of age. We report that: i) a relatively stable community was derived after a single passage of transplanted cecal material, ii) this cecal inoculum significantly but ephemerally altered community structure relative to the environmental inoculum and PBS controls, and iii) either microbiome transplant administered at day-of-hatch appeared to have some protective effects against pathogen challenge relative to uninoculated controls. Differentially abundant taxa identified across treatment types may inform future studies aimed at identifying strains associated with beneficial phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W3105418468,"We developed a quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) of haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) associated with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC)-contaminated beef (intact beef cuts, ground beef and commercial hamburgers) in children under 15 years of age from Argentina. The QMRA was used to characterize STEC prevalence and concentration levels in each product through the Argentinean beef supply chain, including cattle primary production, cattle transport, processing and storage in the abattoir, retail and home preparation, and consumption. Median HUS probability from beef cut, ground beef and commercial hamburger consumption was &lt;10 −15 , 5.4x10 -8 and 3.5x10 -8 , respectively. The expected average annual number of HUS cases was 0, 28 and 4, respectively. Risk of infection and HUS probability were sensitive to the type of abattoir, the application or not of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) for STEC (HACCP-STEC), stx prevalence in carcasses and trimmings, storage conditions from the abattoir to retailers and home, the joint consumption of salads and beef products, and cooking preference. The QMRA results showed that the probability of HUS was higher if beef cuts (1.7x) and ground beef (1.2x) were from carcasses provided by abattoirs not applying HACCP-STEC. Thus, the use of a single sanitary standard that included the application of HACCP-STEC in all Argentinean abattoirs would greatly reduce HUS incidence. The average number of annual HUS cases estimated by the QMRA (n = 32) would explain about 10.0% of cases in children under 15 years per year in Argentina. Since other routes of contamination can be involved, including those not related to food, further research on the beef production chain, other food chains, person-to-person transmission and outbreak studies should be conducted to reduce the impact of HUS on the child population of Argentina."
https://openalex.org/W3103605764,"Background Gulf War (GW) Illness (GWI) is a debilitating condition with a complex constellation of immune, endocrine and neurological symptoms, including cognitive impairment, anxiety and depression. We studied a novel model of GWI based on 3 known common GW exposures (GWE): (i) intranasal lipopolysaccharide, to which personnel were exposed during desert sand storms; (ii) pyridostigmine bromide, used as prophylaxis against chemical warfare; and (iii) chronic unpredictable stress, an inescapable element of war. We used this model to evaluate prophylactic treatment with the PPARγ agonist, rosiglitazone (ROSI). Methods Rats were subjected to the three GWE for 33 days. In series 1 and 2, male and female GWE-rats were compared to naïve rats. In series 3, male rats with GWE were randomly assigned to prophylactic treatment with ROSI (GWE-ROSI) or vehicle. After the 33-day exposures, three neurofunctional domains were evaluated: cognition (novel object recognition), anxiety-like behaviors (elevated plus maze, open field) and depression-like behaviors (coat state, sucrose preference, splash test, tail suspension and forced swim). Brains were analyzed for astrocytic and microglial activation and neuroinflammation (GFAP, Iba1, tumor necrosis factor and translocator protein). Neurofunctional data from rats with similar exposures were pooled into 3 groups: naïve, GWE and GWE-ROSI. Results Compared to naïve rats, GWE-rats showed significant abnormalities in the three neurofunctional domains, along with significant neuroinflammation in amygdala and hippocampus. There were no differences between males and females with GWE. GWE-ROSI rats showed significant attenuation of neuroinflammation and of some of the neurofunctional abnormalities. Conclusion This novel GWI model recapitulates critical neurofunctional abnormalities reported by Veterans with GWI. Concurrent prophylactic treatment with ROSI was beneficial in this model."

Data was collected with pretested structured questionnaires. A Chi-square test used to check statistical associations between variables. Those variables with a p-value of less than 0.05 were selected for cross-tabulation and binary logistic regression. P-value set at 0.05, and 95% CI was used to determine the significance of the association. Relative risk was used to determine the strength and direction of the association. Result Among 438 participants, there where 75(52.1%) primigravida in a stained fluid group compared to112 (38.5%) of the non-stained fluid group. Labour was induced in 25 (17.4%) of the stained fluid group compared to 25(8.6%) of a non-stained fluid group and has a statistically significant association with meconium staining. The stained fluid group was twice more likely to undergo operative delivery compared with a non-stained fluid group. There were more low Apgar scores at birth (36.8% versus 13.2%), birth asphyxias (9% versus 2.4%), neonatal sepsis (1% versus 5.6%), neonatal death (1% versus 9%), and increased admissions to neonatal intensive care unit (6.2% versus 21.5%) among the meconium-stained group as compared to the non-stained group.

https://openalex.org/W3103659414,"Background Recent literature data have highlighted the important role of hypovitaminosis D in pregnancy complications and prenatal/perinatal health. Vitamin D action takes place through vitamin D receptor (VDR) activation. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms of VDR gene, FokI and BsmI , have been reported to affect VDR molecular signaling and be associated with several disorders, including hypertension. Methods We carried out a case-control study aimed to assess vitamin D serum levels together with the distribution of VDR Fok I and Bsm I in a population of 116 pregnant women with gestational hypertension (GH) and 69 normotensive pregnant women (CTR). Results Hypovitaminosis D was largely prevalent both in GH (81%) and CTR (69%) pregnant women. Vitamin D insufficiency (10–30 ng/ml) had a similar frequency in both cohorts (GH 60% vs CTR 58%), while vitamin D deficiency (&lt;10 ng/ml) was more frequent in GH cohort than in CTR one (21% vs 11%). Regression analysis showed that GH was significantly (p = 0.031) linked to vitamin D status. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with a threefold-increased risk of developing GH, while a normal vitamin D status was protective against this pregnancy disorder. The VDR FF/bB haplotype was the most frequent in GH cohort, and resulted to increase by two folds the risk for GH. Notably, hypovitaminosis D was found in 92% of FF/bB GH pregnant women, 27% of which had deficient vitamin D levels compared with 11% of their normotensive counterparts. Conclusions Despite being preliminary, these findings suggest that genotyping of pregnant women for VDR polymorphisms may be useful for a tailored vitamin D supplementation strategy."
https://openalex.org/W3142238651,"Small-scale fisheries are responsible for landing half of the world’s fish catch, yet there are very sparse data on these fishing activities and associated fisheries production in time and space. Fisheries-dependent data underpin scientific guidance of management and conservation of fisheries systems, but it is inherently difficult to generate robust and comprehensive data for small-scale fisheries, particularly given their dispersed and diverse nature. In tackling this challenge, we use open source software components including the Shiny R package to build PeskAAS ; an adaptable and scalable digital application that enables the collation, classification, analysis and visualisation of small-scale fisheries catch and effort data. We piloted and refined this system in Timor-Leste; a small island developing nation. The features that make PeskAAS fit for purpose are that it is: (i) fully open-source and free to use (ii) component-based, flexible and able to integrate vessel tracking data with catch records; (iii) able to perform spatial and temporal filtering of fishing productivity by fishing method and habitat; (iv) integrated with species-specific length-weight parameters from FishBase ; (v) controlled through a click-button dashboard, that was co-designed with fisheries scientists and government managers, that enables easy to read data summaries and interpretation of context-specific fisheries data. With limited training and code adaptation, the PeskAAS workflow has been used as a framework on which to build and adapt systematic, standardised data collection for small-scale fisheries in other contexts. Automated analytics of these data can provide fishers, managers and researchers with insights into a fisher’s experience of fishing efforts, fisheries status, catch rates, economic efficiency and geographic preferences and limits that can potentially guide management and livelihood investments."

Herein, possible strategies to improve the diagnostic performance of LR-5 without reducing specificity for HCC were investigated. This retrospective study included 792 patients who underwent gadoxetate disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Hepatic observations were categorized according to LI-RADS v2018 and categories were readjusted by upgrading LR4 to LR5 using ancillary features, arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE) interpreted with subtraction images, indication of no washout when APHE was absent, extension of washout to the transitional phase, and subthreshold growth as a major feature. Based on LI-RADS v2018, LR-5 showed a sensitivity of 71.9% and a specificity of 97.9% for the diagnosis of HCC. Category-readjusted LR-5 after upgrading LR-4 to LR-5 using ancillary features favoring HCC in particular, subthreshold growth as a major feature, extending washout to transitional phase and APHE interpreted using subtraction images showed significantly increased sensitivity ( P &lt;0.001) without decreased specificity ( Ps &gt;0.05).

https://openalex.org/W3101780905,"Differential expressions of estrogen/progesterone receptors (ER/PR) and individual component of extracellular matrices derived from fibroid are reported. Information on the pattern of change in ER/PR expression and amount of tissue fibrosis after hormonal treatment is unclear. We investigated pattern of change in ER/PR expression and percentage of tissue fibrosis in different uterine leiomyomas after gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) treatment. Biopsy specimens from fibroids and adjacent myometria were collected after surgery from women with submucosal myoma (SMM, n = 18), intramural myoma (IMM, n = 16) and subserosal myoma (SSM, n = 17). A proportion of women in each group of fibroid underwent treatment with GnRHa for a variable period of 3–6 months. Tissue expression of ER and PR was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. In vitro cell proliferation effect of GnRHa on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was examined. Distribution of tissue fibrosis was examined by Masson’s trichrome staining with computer-captured image analysis of fibrosis derived from different types of fibroid. PR content was significantly higher than ER in tissues derived from GnRHa-untreated women with SMM and SSM (p = 0.04 for both). Comparing to untreated group, GnRHa-treatment significantly decreased either ER or PR expression in different fibroids. Exogenous treatment with GnRHa dose-dependently decreased proliferation of HUVECs. No significant difference was observed in the percentage of fibrosis in tissues collected from GnRHa-treated and -untreated women with fibroids. The distribution of fibrosis in myoma/myometria and occurrence of fibrosis in perivascular area showed an increasing trend with higher age of the women and with larger size of fibroids. Our findings suggest that despite estrogen dependency, higher PR content in GnRHa-untreated group may indicate a potential role of progesterone in leiomyoma growth. Although GnRHa therapy may shrink fibroids and reduce risk of bleeding during surgery, the occurrence of diffuse tissue fibrosis may impair effective reduction of fibroid size after hormonal treatment."

Despite better tolerance have been verified by the artificial aging treatment for polyploid rice seed, the delayed senescence properties and delayed senescence related regulatory mechanisms of polyploid rice seed are rarely reported, due to the lack of polyploid rice materials with high seed set. High-throughput sequencing was applied to systematically investigate variations in small RNAs, the degradome, and the proteome between tetraploid and diploid rice seeds. Degradome sequencing analysis of microRNAs showed that expression of miR-164d, which regulates genes encoding antioxidant enzymes, was changed significantly, resulting in decreased miRNA-mediated cleavage of target genes in tetraploid rice. Comparisons of the expression levels of small RNAs (sRNAs) in the tetraploid and diploid libraries revealed that 12 sRNAs changed significantly, consistent with the findings from degradome sequencing. Furthermore, proteomics also showed that antioxidant enzymes were up-regulated in tetraploid rice seeds, relative to diploids."

To understand the incidence of foodborne gastroenteritis due to non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica and Vibrio parahaemolyticus , population survey and sentinel hospital surveillance were conducted during July 2010 to June 2011 in Shanghai, east China, and a model for calculating disease burden was established. The multiplier for gastroenteritis caused by these pathogens was estimated at 59 [95% confidence interval (CI) 30–102]. Annual incidence per 100,000 population in Shanghai was estimated as 48 (95% CI 24–83) and 183 (95% CI 93–317) cases for foodborne non-typhoidal salmonellosis and V . parahaemolyticus gastroenteritis, respectively, illustrating that bacterial gastroenteritis due to these two pathogens poses a substantial health burden. There is a significant difference between our simulated incidence and the data actually reported for foodborne diseases, indicating significant underreporting and underdiagnosis of non-typhoidal S . enterica and V . parahaemolyticus gastroenteritis in the surveillance area. The present research demonstrates basic situation of the health burden caused by major foodborne pathogens in the surveillance area. Enhanced laboratory-based sentinel hospital surveillance is one of the effective ways to monitor food safety in east China."

However, the relationship between sleep habits and meeting physical activity guidelines is still unclear. This study aimed to assess this relationship among fifth- to eighth-grade (ages 10–14) Japanese children. This cross-sectional study included 3,123 children (boys: 1,558, girls: 1,565, mean age: 12.5 ± 1.2 years). Questionnaires were used to assess parameters such as moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day, school and weekend night sleep durations, social jetlag, daytime sleepiness, napping, screen time, and breakfast intake. Participants were divided into an achievement and a non-achievement group depending on their physical activity guideline achievement status (i.e., whether they met the children’s physical activity guideline of 60 min or more of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day). Then, to determine the sleep habits in relation to the children’s achievement of guideline-recommended physical activity levels, multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted. In fifth- and sixth-grade (ages 10–12) boys, an inverse association was observed between physical activity guideline achievement and daytime sleepiness. In seventh- and eighth-grade (ages 12–14) boys, physical activity guideline achievement was inversely associated with social jetlag and skipping breakfast. Additionally, in seventh- and eighth-grade girls, physical activity guideline achievement was inversely associated with inappropriate sleep duration on weekends and screen time. These results suggest that meeting the physical activity guideline is related to favorable sleep habits in Japanese children. However, their relevance may differ by school type and gender."

https://openalex.org/W3102677103,"Concrete production is globally a major water consumer, and in general, drinking-quality water is mixed in the binder. In the present study, simulated sea water and reverse osmosis reject water were used as batching water for one-part (dry-mix) alkali-activated blast furnace slag mortar. Alkali-activated materials are low-CO 2 alternative binders gaining world-wide acceptance in construction. However, their production requires approximately similar amount of water as regular Portland cement concrete. The results of the present study revealed that the use of saline water did not hinder strength development, increased setting time, and did not affect workability. The salts incorporated in the binder decreased the total porosity of mortar, but they did not form separate phases detectable with X-ray diffraction or scanning electron microscopy. Leaching tests for monolithic materials revealed only minimal leaching. Furthermore, results for crushed mortars (by a standard two-stage leaching test) were within the limits of non-hazardous waste. Thus, the results indicated that high-salinity waters can be used safely in one-part alkali-activated slag to prepare high-strength mortars. Moreover, alkali-activation technology could be used as a novel stabilization/solidification method for reverse osmosis reject waters, which frequently pose disposal problems."

Here, it was evaluated if SIT intensity can be maintained in mild to moderate hypoxia. It was hypothesized that 6 x 30 s Wingate sprint performance with 2 min active rest between sprints can be performed in hypoxic conditions corresponding to ~3,000 m of altitude without reducing mean power output (MPO). In a single-blinded, randomized crossover design, ten highly-trained male endurance athletes with a maximal oxygen uptake ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M1""><mml:mover accent=""true""><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant=""normal"">V</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>˙</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math> O 2max ) of 68 ± 5 mL O 2 × min -1 × kg -1 completed 6 x 30 s all-out Wingate cycling sprints separated by two-minute active recovery on four separate days in a hypobaric chamber. The ambient pressure within the chamber on each experimental day was 772 mmHg (~0 m), 679 mmHg (~915 m), 585 mmHg (~ 2,150 m), and 522 mmHg (~3,050 m), respectively. MPO was not different at sea-level and up to ~2,150 m (~1% and ~3% non-significant decrements at ~915 and ~2,150 m, respectively), whereas MPO was ~5% lower (P&lt;0.05) at ~3,050 m. Temporal differences between altitudes was not different for peak power output (PPO), despite a main effect of altitude. In conclusion, repeated Wingate exercise can be completed by highly-trained athletes at altitudes up to ~2,150 m without compromising MPO or PPO. In contrast, MPO was compromised in hypobaric hypoxia corresponding to ~3,050 m. Thus, SIT may be an efficient strategy for athletes sojourning to moderate altitude and aiming to maintain training quality."
https://openalex.org/W3100211612,"We investigated how the shape of polymeric vesicles, made by the exact same material, impacts the replication activity and metabolic state of both cancer and non-cancer cell types. First, we isolated discrete geometrical structures (spheres and tubes) from a heterogeneous sample using density-gradient centrifugation. Then, we characterized the cellular internalization and the kinetics of uptake of both types of polymersomes in different cell types (either cancer or non-cancer cells). We also investigated the cellular metabolic response as a function of the shape of the structures internalized and discovered that tubular vesicles induce a significant decrease in the replication activity of cancer cells compared to spherical vesicles. We related this effect to the significant up-regulation of the tumor suppressor genes p21 and p53 with a concomitant activation of caspase 3/7. Finally, we demonstrated that combining the intrinsic shape-dependent effects of tubes with the delivery of doxorubicin significantly increases the cytotoxicity of the system. Our results illustrate how the geometrical conformation of nanoparticles could impact cell behavior and how this could be tuned to create novel drug delivery systems tailored to specific biomedical application."
https://openalex.org/W3100683548,"Genome-wide association studies have identified multiple genomic loci associated with coronary artery disease, but most are common variants in non-coding regions that provide limited information on causal genes and etiology of the disease. To overcome the limited scope that common variants provide, we focused our investigation on low-frequency and rare sequence variations primarily residing in coding regions of the genome.Using samples of individuals of European ancestry from ten cohorts within the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium, both cross-sectional and prospective analyses were conducted to examine associations between genetic variants and myocardial infarction (MI), coronary heart disease (CHD), and all-cause mortality following these events. For prevalent events, a total of 27,349 participants of European ancestry, including 1831 prevalent MI cases and 2518 prevalent CHD cases were used. For incident cases, a total of 55,736 participants of European ancestry were included (3,031 incident MI cases and 5,425 incident CHD cases). There were 1,860 all-cause deaths among the 3,751 MI and CHD cases from six cohorts that contributed to the analysis of all-cause mortality. Single variant and gene-based analyses were performed separately in each cohort and then meta-analyzed for each outcome. A low-frequency intronic variant (rs988583) in PLCL1 was significantly associated with prevalent MI (OR = 1.80, 95% confidence interval: 1.43, 2.27; P = 7.12 × 10-7). We conducted gene-based burden tests for genes with a cumulative minor allele count (cMAC) ≥ 5 and variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) < 5%. TMPRSS5 and LDLRAD1 were significantly associated with prevalent MI and CHD, respectively, and RC3H2 and ANGPTL4 were significantly associated with incident MI and CHD, respectively. No loci were significantly associated with all-cause mortality following a MI or CHD event.This study identified one known locus (ANGPTL4) and four new loci (PLCL1, RC3H2, TMPRSS5, and LDLRAD1) associated with cardiovascular disease risk that warrant further investigation."

The findings revealed that the link between narcissism and relationship satisfaction is fully mediated by intentions towards infidelity. Similarly, the full mediating effect of relationship satisfaction exists in the association between narcissism and intentions towards infidelity. Mediational analyses further revealed that narcissism is a predictor of intentions towards infidelity, and this link is moderated by preoccupied, fearful, and dismissive attachment styles. As the results indicate, narcissism plays a significant role in young adults’ intimate relationships, and attachment styles have a moderating role in narcissism’s effect on romantic relationships.

https://openalex.org/W3105413187,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a carcinoma of the lungs with strong invasion, poor prognosis and resistant to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs. It has posed severe challenges for the effective treatment of lung cancer. Therefore, searching for genes related to the development and prognosis of SCLC and uncovering their underlying molecular mechanisms are urgent problems to be resolved. This study is aimed at exploring the potential pathogenic and prognostic crucial genes and key pathways of SCLC via bioinformatic analysis of public datasets. Firstly, 117 SCLC samples and 51 normal lung samples were collected and analyzed from three gene expression datasets. Then, 102 up-regulated and 106 down-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were observed. And then, functional annotation and pathway enrichment analyzes of DEGs was performed utilizing the FunRich. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the DEGs was constructed through the STRING website, visualized by Cytoscape. Finally, the expression levels of eight hub genes were confirmed in Oncomine database and human samples from SCLC patients. It showed that CDC20 , BUB1 , TOP2A , RRM2 , CCNA2 , UBE2C , MAD2L1 , and BUB1B were upregulated in SCLC tissues compared to paired adjacent non-cancerous tissues. These suggested that eight hub genes might be viewed as new biomarkers for prognosis of SCLC or to guide individualized medication for the therapy of SCLC."
https://openalex.org/W3105960723,"Background Anemia is a global public health problem; but its burden is disproportionately borne among children in the African Regions. The 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey report showed that the prevalence of anemia among children 6–59 months of age was 57%; far exceeding the national target of 25% set for 2015. Although studies have been conducted in Ethiopia, multilevel analysis has rarely been used to identify factors associated with anemia among children. Therefore, this study aimed to identify individual and community-level factors associated with anemia among children 6–59 months of age by fitting a multilevel logistic regression model. Methods The data was obtained from the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey, conducted from January to June 2016, and downloaded from the website http://www.DHSprogram.com . The sample was taken using two-stage stratified sampling. In stage one, 645 Enumeration Areas and in stage two 28 households per Enumeration Area were selected. A sample of 7790 children 6–59 months of age was included. Data were analyzed using STATA version 14. A multilevel logistic regression model was fitted and an adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was obtained. Result From the individual-level factors, anemia was associated most strongly with child age, wealth index, maternal anemia and child stunting followed by child underweight, child fever and birth order whereas from the community-level, the strongest odds of anemia occurred among children from Somali, Harari, Dire Dawa and Afar region followed by Oromia and Addis Ababa. Low community-poverty is a protective factor for anemia. The odds of anemia were 0.81 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.99) times lower for children who were living in communities of lower poverty status than children who were living in communities of higher poverty status. Children from Somali and Dire Dawa had 3.38 (95% CI: 3.25, 5.07) and 2.22 (95% CI: 1.42, 3.48) times higher odds of anemia, respectively than children from the Tigray region. Conclusions This study shows that anemia among children 6–59 months of age is affected both by the individual and community level factors. It is better to strengthen the strategies of early detection and management of stunted and underweight children. At the same time, interventions should be strengthened to address maternal anemia, child fever and poverty, specifically targeting regions identified to have a high risk of anemia."
https://openalex.org/W3101078088,"Background Early initiation of breastfeeding within one hour of birth (EIBF) and no prelacteal feeding are WHO recommended practices for improving maternal and newborn health outcomes. Globally, EIBF can avert around 22% of newborn death. In recent years, Bangladesh has experienced increasing facility delivery coverage and cesarean section rates. However, the impact of these changes on early breastfeeding initiation in hard to reach areas (HtR) of the country is still poorly understood. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the independent associations between childbirth locations and mode of delivery with favorable early breastfeeding practices in four hard to reach areas of Bangladesh. Method We extracted data from a cross-sectional study conducted in four HtR areas of Bangladesh in 2017. A total of 2768 women, having birth outcomes in the past 12 months of the survey, were interviewed using structured questionnaires. EIBF and no prelacteal feeding were considered as favorable early breastfeeding practices. The categories of childbirth locations were defined by the place of birth (home vs. facility) and the delivery sector (public/NGO vs. private). The mode of delivery was categorized into vaginal delivery and cesarean section. Generalized linear models were used to test the independent associations while adjusting for potential confounders. Results The prevalence of EIBF practices were 69.6%(95% CI:67.8–71.3); 72.2%(95% CI:67.8–71.3) among home births Vs 63.0%(95% CI:59.5%-66.4%) among facility births. Around 73.9% (95% CI:72.3–75.6) mother’s in the study areas reported no-prelacteal feeding. Compared to home births, women delivering in the facilities had lower adjusted odds of EIBF (aOR = 0.51; 95%CI:0.35–0.75). Cesarean section was found to be negatively associated with EIBF (aOR = 0.20; 95%CI:0.12–0.35), after adjusting for potential confounders. We could not find any significant associations between the place of birth and mode of delivery with no prelacteal feeding. Discussions This study found that facility births and cesarean deliveries were negatively associated with EIBF. Although the implementation of ""Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiatives"" could be a potential solution for improving EIBF and no prelacteal feeding practices, the challenges of reduced service availability and accessibility in HtR areas must be considered while devising effective intervention strategies. Future studies can explore potential interventions to promote early breastfeeding for facility births and cesarean deliveries in HtR areas."
https://openalex.org/W3011370284,"Many researchers have proposed that straight men prefer women’s faces displaying feminine shape characteristics at least partly because mating with such women will produce healthier offspring. Although a prediction of this adaptation-for-mate-choice hypothesis is that straight men will show stronger preferences for feminized versus masculinized versions of women’s faces than will gay men, only one previous study has directly tested this prediction. Here we directly replicated that study by comparing 623 gay and 3163 straight men’s preferences for feminized versus masculinized versions of faces. Consistent with the adaptation-for-mate-choice hypothesis of straight men’s femininity preferences, we found that straight men showed significantly stronger preferences for feminized female faces than did gay men. Consistent with previous research suggesting that gay men place a premium on masculinity in potential romantic partners, we also found that gay men showed significantly stronger preferences for masculinized versions of male faces than did straight men. Together, these findings indicate the sexual orientation contributes to individual differences in men’s face preferences."
https://openalex.org/W3098608416,"Prior research has shown a serious lack of research transparency resulting from the failure to publish study results in a timely manner. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has increased its use of publication rate and time to publication as metrics for grant productivity. In this study, we analyze the publications associated with all R01 and U01 grants funded from 2008 through 2014, providing sufficient time for these grants to publish their findings, and identify predictors of time to publication based on a number of variables, including if a grant was coded as a behavioral and social sciences research (BSSR) grant or not. Overall, 2.4% of the 27,016 R01 and U01 grants did not have a publication associated with the grant within 60 months of the project start date, and this rate of zero publications was higher for BSSR grants (4.6%) than for non-BSSR grants (1.9%). Mean time in months to first publication was 15.2 months, longer for BSSR grants (22.4 months) than non-BSSR grants (13.6 months). Survival curves showed a more rapid reduction of risk to publish from non-BSSR vs BSSR grants. Cox regression models showed that human research (vs. animal, neither, or both) and clinical trials research (vs. not) are the strongest predictors of time to publication and failure to publish, but even after accounting for these and other predictors, BSSR grants continued to show longer times to first publication and greater risk of no publications than non-BSSR grants. These findings indicate that even with liberal criteria for publication (any publication associated with a grant), a small percentage of R01 and U01 grantees fail to publish in a timely manner, and that a number of factors, including human research, clinical trial research, child research, not being an early stage investigator, and conducting behavioral and social sciences research increase the risk of time to first publication."
https://openalex.org/W3099243286,"Background Integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) is a strategy for promoting access of under-served populations to lifesaving treatments through extending case management of common childhood illnesses to trained frontline health workers. In Ethiopia iCCM is provided by health extension workers (HEWs) deployed at health posts. We evaluated the association between the implementation of iCCM program in Assosa Zuria zone, Benishangul Gumuz region and changes in care-seeking for common childhood illnesses. Methods We conducted a pre-post study without control arm to evaluate the association of interest. The iCCM program that incorporated training, mentoring and supportive supervision of HEWs with community-based demand creation activities was implemented for two years (2017–18). Baseline, midline and endline surveys were completed approximately one year apart. Across the surveys, children aged 2–59 months (n = 1,848) who recently had cough, fever or diarrhea were included. Data were analysed using mixed-effects logistic regression model. Results Over the two-year period, care-seeking from any health facility and from health posts significantly increased by 10.7 and 17.4 percentage points (PP) from baseline levels of 64.5 and 34.1%, respectively ( p &lt;0.001). Care sought from health centres ( p = 0.420) and public hospitals ( p = 0.129) did not meaningfully change while proportion of caregivers who approached private ( p = 0.003) and informal providers ( p &lt;0.001) declined. Caregivers who visited health posts for the treatment of diarrhea (19.2 PP, p &lt;0.001), fever (15.5 PP, p &lt;0.001), cough (17.8 PP, p &lt;0.001) and cough with respiratory difficulty (17.3 PP, p = 0.038) significantly increased. After accounting for extraneous variables, we observed that care-seeking from iCCM providers was almost doubled (adjusted odds ratio = 2.32: 95% confidence interval; 1.88–2.86) over the period. Conclusion iCCM implementation was associated with a meaningful shift in care-seeking to health posts."

It is unclear whether exercise changes as a result, or in anticipation, of exercise. Objective To examine changes in cognitive control due to moderate aerobic exercise, and anticipation of such exercise. Methods Thirty-one young healthy adults (mean age 22 years; 55% women) completed three conditions (randomized order): 1) exercise (participants anticipated and completed exercise); 2) anticipation (participants anticipated exercise but completed rest); and 3) rest (participants anticipated and completed rest). Cognitive control was assessed with a modified Flanker task at three timepoints: (1) early (20 min pre-intervention, pre-reveal in anticipation session); (2) pre-intervention (after reveal); and (3) post-intervention. An accuracy-weighted response time (RT LISAS ) was the primary outcome, analyzed with a linear mixed effects modeling approach. Results There was an interaction between condition and time (p = 0.003) and between session and time (p = 0.015). RT LISAS was better post-exercise than post-rest and post-deception, but was similar across conditions at other timepoints. RT LISAS improved across time in session 1 and session 2, but did not improve over time in session 3. There were also main effects of condition (p = 0.024), session (p = 0.005), time (p&lt;0.001), and congruency (p&lt;0.001). Conclusions Cognitive control improved after moderate aerobic exercise, but not in anticipation of exercise. Improvements on a Flanker task were also observed across sessions and time, indicative of a learning effect that should be considered in study design and analyses."
https://openalex.org/W3105969802,"Cytohesin Arf-GEFs promote actin polymerization and protrusions of cultured cells, whereas the Drosophila cytohesin, Steppke, antagonizes actomyosin networks in several developmental contexts. To reconcile these findings, we analyzed epidermal leading edge actin networks during Drosophila embryo dorsal closure. Here, Steppke is required for F-actin of the actomyosin cable and for actin-based protrusions. steppke mutant defects in the leading edge actin networks are associated with improper sealing of the dorsal midline, but are distinguishable from effects of myosin mis-regulation. Steppke localizes to leading edge cell-cell junctions with accumulations of the F-actin regulator Enabled emanating from either side. Enabled requires Steppke for full leading edge recruitment, and genetic interaction shows the proteins cooperate for dorsal closure. Inversely, Steppke over-expression induces ectopic, actin-rich, lamellar cell protrusions, an effect dependent on the Arf-GEF activity and PH domain of Steppke, but independent of Steppke recruitment to myosin-rich AJs via its coiled-coil domain. Thus, Steppke promotes actin polymerization and cell protrusions, effects that occur in conjunction with Steppke’s previously reported regulation of myosin contractility during dorsal closure."
https://openalex.org/W3099226728,"Normative modeling is an increasingly popular method for characterizing the ways in which clinical cohorts deviate from a reference population, with respect to one or more biological features. In this paper, we extend the normative modeling framework with an approach for measuring the amount of heterogeneity in a cohort. This heterogeneity measure is based on the Representational Rényi Heterogeneity method, which generalizes diversity measurement paradigms used across multiple scientific disciplines. We propose that heterogeneity in the normative modeling setting can be measured as the effective number of deviation patterns ; that is, the effective number of coherent patterns by which a sample of data differ from a distribution of normative variation. We show that lower effective number of deviation patterns is associated with the presence of systematic differences from a (non-degenerate) normative distribution. This finding is shown to be consistent across (A) application of a Gaussian process model to synthetic and real-world neuroimaging data, and (B) application of a variational autoencoder to well-understood database of handwritten images."
https://openalex.org/W3102915500,"Renal outer medullary K + channel, ROMK (Kir1.1, kcnj1) is expressed in the kidney and brain, but its role in the central nervous system remains unknown. Recent studies suggested an involvement of the ROMK channel in mental diseases. Tertiapin (TPN) is a European honey bee venom peptide and is reported to selectively block the ROMK channel. Here, we have chemically synthesized a series of mutated TPN peptides, including TPN-I8R and -M13Q (TPN-RQ), reported previously, and examined their blocking activity on the ROMK channel. Among 71 peptides tested, TPN-RQ was found to block the ROMK channel most effectively. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings showed the essential roles of two disulfide bonds and the circular structure for the blockade activity. To examine the central role, we injected TPN-RQ intracerebroventricularly and examined the effects on depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in mice. TPN-RQ showed an antidepressive effect in tail-suspension and forced swim tests. The injection of TPN-RQ also enhanced the anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus-maze and light/dark box tests and impaired spontaneous motor activities in balance beam and wheel running tests. Administration of TPM-RQ suppressed the anti-c-Fos immunoreactivity in the lateral septum, without affecting immunoreactivity in antidepressant-related nuclei, e.g. the dorsal raphe nucleus and locus coeruleus. TPN-RQ may exert its antidepressive effects through a different mechanism from current drugs."
https://openalex.org/W3098990366,"The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of a single session of prolonged tendon vibration combined with low submaximal isometric contraction on maximal motor performance. Thirty-two young sedentary adults were assigned into two groups that differed based on the knee angle tested: 90° or 150° (180° = full knee extension). Participants performed two fatigue-inducing exercise protocols: one with three 10 min submaximal (10% of maximal voluntary contraction) knee extensor contractions and patellar tendon vibration (80 Hz) another with submaximal knee extensor contractions only. Before and after each fatigue protocol, maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC), voluntary activation level (assessed by the twitch interpolation technique), peak-to-peak amplitude of maximum compound action potentials of vastus medialis and vastus lateralis (assessed by electromyography with the use of electrical nerve stimulation), peak twitch amplitude and peak doublet force were measured. The knee extensor fatigue was significantly (P&lt;0.05) greater in the 90° knee angle group (-20.6% MVC force, P&lt;0.05) than the 150° knee angle group (-8.3% MVC force, P = 0.062). Both peripheral and central alterations could explain the reduction in MVC force at 90° knee angle. However, tendon vibration added to isometric contraction did not exacerbate the reduction in MVC force. These results clearly demonstrate that acute infrapatellar tendon vibration using a commercial apparatus operating at optimal conditions (i.e. contracted and stretched muscle) does not appear to induce knee extensor neuromuscular fatigue in young sedentary subjects."

Design Quasi-experimental, time-sequence intervention, retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis. Methods A program integrating leadership development, clinical skills and quality improvement training was piloted at the Greater Accra Regional Hospital from 2013 to 2016. The number of intrapartum and neonatal deaths prevented were estimated using the hospital’s 2012 stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates as a steady-state assumption. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention was calculated as cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. In order to test the assumptions included in this analysis, it was subjected to probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses. Main outcome measures Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which measures the cost per disability-adjusted life-year averted by the intervention compared to status quo. Results From 2012 to 2016, there were 45,495 births at the Greater Accra Regional Hospital, of whom 5,734 were admitted to the newborn intensive care unit. The budget for the systems strengthening program was US $1,716,976. Based on program estimates, 307 (±82) neonatal deaths and 84 (±35) stillbirths were prevented, amounting to 12,342 DALYs averted. The systems strengthening intervention was found to be highly cost effective with an ICER of US $139 (±$44), an amount significantly lower than the established threshold of cost-effectiveness of the per capita gross domestic product, which averaged US $1,649 between 2012–2016. The results were found to be sensitive to the following parameters: DALYs averted, number of neonatal deaths, and number of stillbirths. Conclusion An integrated approach to system strengthening in referral hospitals has the potential to reduce neonatal and intrapartum mortality in low resource settings and is likely to be cost-effective. Sustained change can be achieved by building organizational capacity through leadership and clinical training."
https://openalex.org/W3100534429,"The radiochemical analysis of plutonium activity in urine is the main method for indirect estimation of doses of internal exposure from plutonium incorporation in professional workers. It was previously shown that late-in-life acute diseases, particularly those that affect the liver, can promote accelerated rates of release of plutonium from the liver with enhanced excretion rates. This initial study examines the relationships of some chronic diseases on plutonium excretion as well as the terminal relative distribution of plutonium between the liver and skeleton. Fourteen cases from former workers at the Mayak Production Association (Mayak PA) who provided from 4–9 urine plutonium bioassays for plutonium, had an autopsy conducted after death, and had sufficient clinical records to document their health status were used in this study. Enhanced plutonium excretion was associated with more serious chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and other diseases that involved the liver. These chronic diseases were also associated with relatively less plutonium found in the liver relative to the skeleton determined by analyses conducted after autopsy. These data further document health conditions that affect plutonium biokinetics and organ deposition and retention patterns and suggest that health status should be considered when conducting plutonium bioassays as these may alter subsequent dosimetry and risk models."
https://openalex.org/W3100933076,"Wildlife tourism attractions (WTA) are popular in the United States, but they may be harmful to the individual animals involved and we question whether they provide benefits to environmental conservation. Most research on the welfare and environmental implications of WTAs focuses on charismatic mammals, with few studies investigating these issues for reptiles. Here we examine alligator wrestling, including its impact on animal welfare and environmental conservation. Using a sample of 94 relevant YouTube videos of alligator wrestling in Florida representing 16 different venues, we coded the environmental and behavioral characteristics evident in each video. We then performed a content analysis of wrestlers’ narration in a subset of 51 videos to analyze the environmental awareness and educational components of alligator wrestling. Our results show systemic welfare harm: 11 venues housed adult alligators together with conspecifics, 96% of alligator wrestling performances facilitated direct contact in the form of physical restraint by one or more human wrestlers, and as many as 96% of the videos did not show a suitable water or waterside features for captive alligators. Furthermore, 12% of performances showed wrestlers flipping alligators onto their backs while 16% showed wrestlers tying alligators’ jaws shut, both of which are known to be acute stressors. Finally, just under half of alligator wrestling commentary (49%) addressed environmental conservation topics, and much of this commentary included contradictory or misleading information that is not likely to benefit alligators in the wild. We argue that alligator wrestling serves no role in promoting positive relationships between humans, animals, and the environment, and instead furthers traditional notions of dominion that undermine welfare and conservation aims."
https://openalex.org/W3101002895,"Introduction Hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism (HA-VTE) in children comprises multiple risk factors that should not be evaluated separately due to collinearity and multiple cause and effect relationships. This is one of the first case-control study of pediatric HA-VTE risk factors using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) analysis. Material and methods Retrospective, case-control study with 22 cases of objectively confirmed HA-VTE and 76 controls matched by age, sex, unit of admission, and period of hospitalization. Descriptive statistics were used to define distributions of continuous variables, frequencies, and proportions of categorical variables, comparing cases and controls. Due to many potential risk factors of HA-VTE, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) model was created to identify confounding, reduce bias, and increase precision on the analysis. The final model consisted of a DAG-informed conditional logistic regression. Results In the initial conventional univariable model, the following variables were selected as potential risk factors for HA-VTE: length of stay (LOS, days), immobility, ICU admission in the last 30 days, LOS in ICU, infection, central venous catheter (CVC), number of CVCs placed, L-asparaginase, heart failure, liver failure, and nephrotic syndrome. The final model using the set of variables selected by DAG analysis revealed LOS (OR = 1.106, 95%CI = 1.021–1.198, p = 0.013), L-asparaginase (OR = 26.463, 95%CI = 1.609–435.342, p = 0.022), and nephrotic syndrome (OR = 29.127, 95%CI = 1.044–812.508, p = 0.004) as independent risk factors for HA-VTE. Conclusion The DAG-based approach was useful to clarify the influence of confounders and multiple causalities of HA-VTE. Interestingly, CVC placement—a known thrombotic risk factor highlighted in several studies—was considered a confounder, while LOS, L-asparaginase use and nephrotic syndrome were confirmed as risk factors to HA-VTE. Large confidence intervals are related to the sample size; however, the results were significant."
https://openalex.org/W3103548061,"Objective To assess whether survival and clinical events following elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair were associated with remoteness of residence in North Queensland, Australia. Methods This retrospective cohort study included participants undergoing elective AAA repair between February 2002 and April 2020 at two hospitals in Townsville, North Queensland, Australia. Outcomes were all-cause survival and AAA-related events, defined as requirement for repeat AAA repair or AAA-related mortality. Remoteness of participant’s place of residence was assessed by the Modified Monash Model classifications and estimated distance from the participants’ home to the tertiary vascular centre. Cox proportional hazard analysis examined the association of remoteness with outcome. Results The study included 526 participants undergoing elective repair by open (n = 204) or endovascular (n = 322) surgery. Fifty-four (10.2%) participants had a place of residence at a remote or very remote location. Participants' were followed for a median of 5.2 (inter-quartile range 2.5–8.3) years, during which time there were 252 (47.9%) deaths. Survival was not associated with either measure of remoteness. Fifty (9.5%) participants had at least one AAA-related event, including 30 (5.7%) that underwent at least one repeat AAA surgery and 23 (4.4%) that had AAA-related mortality. AAA-related events were more common in participants resident in the most remote areas (adjusted hazard ratio 2.83, 95% confidence intervals 1.40, 5.70) but not associated with distance from the participants’ residence to the tertiary vascular centre Conclusions The current study found that participants living in more remote locations were more likely to have AAA-related events but had no increased mortality following AAA surgery. The findings emphasize the need for careful follow-up after AAA surgery. Further studies are needed to examine the generalisability of the findings."
https://openalex.org/W3103867749,"Background The ability to balance on one foot for a certain time is a widely used clinical test to assess the effects of age and diseases like peripheral neuropathy on balance. While state-space methods have been used to explore the mechanical demands and achievable accelerations for balancing on two feet in the sagittal plane, less is known about the requirements for sustaining one legged balance (OLB) in the frontal plane. Research question While most studies have focused on ankle function in OLB, can age and/or disease-related decreases in maximum hip abduction strength also affect OLB ability? Methods A two-link frontal plane state space model was used to define and explore the ‘feasible balance region’ which helps reveal the requirements for maintaining and restoring OLB, given the adverse effects of age and peripheral neuropathy on maximum hip and ankle strengths. Results Maintaining quasistatic OLB required 50%-106% of the maximum hip abduction strength in young and older adults, and older patients with peripheral neuropathy. Effectiveness of a ‘hip strategy’ in recovering OLB was heavily dependent on the maximum hip abduction strength, and for healthy older women was as important as ankle strength. Natural reductions of strength due to healthy aging did not show a meaningful reduction in meeting the strength requirement of clinical OLB. However deficits in hip strength typical of patients with peripheral neuropathy did adversely affect both quasistatic OLB and recoverable OLB states. Significance The importance of hip muscle strength has been underappreciated in the clinical OLB test. This is partly because the passive tissues of the hip joint can mask moderate deficits in hip abduction strength until it is needed for recovering OLB. Adding a follow up OLB test with a slightly raised pelvis would be a simple way to check for adequate hip abductor muscle strength."
https://openalex.org/W3105759199,"Background Studies revealed that internal migrants are one of the most vulnerable groups for poor sexual and reproductive health (SRH) information and services. Risky sexual behavior (RSB) is a threat to public health and might lead to serious health problems such as unintended pregnancy, abortion, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV/AIDS. The reported prevalence of RSB among young female internal migrants in Ethiopia was as high as 70.3%. This requires in-depth understanding of the underlying cause. So, this study aimed at exploring reasons for RSB among sexually-active unmarried young female migrants in Ethiopia. Methods A descriptive qualitative study was conducted using focus group discussions among sexually-active young female migrants working Burayu town. The focus group discussions were done in the local languages of participants (Afaan Oromo and Amharic). The recorded data were transcribed verbatim and translated into English for analysis and presentation in the study. The data were coded and Atlas.ti 7.5 software packages were used for data analyses. Then, the findings were thematically organized and analyzed using content analysis. Results This study revealed that poor socio-economic status, social media indulgence, rape, substance use, poor knowledge of condom use, unfavorable attitude toward condom use, misconceptions about emergency pills, and the nature of the new environment and work place were responsible for RSB among internal migrants. The participants described that the migrants’ economic conditions and workplace sexual violence are pushing them toward engaging in unprotected sex, being sexually abused, commercial sex, and transactional sex. Conclusions Internal migrants’ sexual behavior is a complex process influenced by multiple interrelating systems. We have explored a set of factors namely poverty, pressure and sexual abuse from brokers, sexual exploitation and abuses against domestic workers by their bosses, indulgence in social media, sexting, inadequate knowledge, and unfavorable attitude toward condom use that led young female internal migrants to risky sexual practices. An intervention to promote safe sex targeted to this population is urgently needed with a focus on an intervention to eliminate misconceptions about condoms, increase proper condom use, and end sexual violence. Moreover, a relevant policy is needed to safeguard internal migrants from sexual exploitation and abuses at their work place."
https://openalex.org/W3099677211,"Background Chest radiography is not routinely recommended before elective endoscopies. A high incidence of perioperative chest radiography requests was observed at our institution. This study aims to investigate factors influencing preoperative chest radiography request for patients undergoing elective gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopies. Methods This cross-sectional clinical study recruited 264 participants from different medical specialties who were responsible for preoperative endoscopic chest x-ray (CXR) ordering including anesthesiologists, surgeons and gastroenterologists. They completed questionnaires exploring their general knowledge and attitudes about preoperative chest radiography. Demographic characteristic of the participants affecting the knowledge on preoperative chest radiography was determined. A Structural Equation Model (SEM) was constructed from validated conceptual framework to find causal relationships between hypothesized factors and intention for preoperative endoscopic chest radiography request. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software version 18.0 and Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) version 18.0. Results The questionnaire response rate was 53.79%. Baseline general knowledge on preoperative chest radiography of the participants was comparable. The SEM results showed unsupported relationship between hypothesized factors and the intention for preprocedural GI endoscopic CXR request (p &lt; 0.1). Conclusions General knowledge of medical personnel on tuberculosis needs improvement. To rectify the unnecessary chest radiography request before elective GI endoscopic procedures, awareness of the patients’ health conditions, adherence to the hospital’s policy and realizing of possible patient-related mishaps are not the determinants for preprocedural endoscopic chest radiography request. Future works are required to explore other alternative factors involved for reducing chest radiography requests which are not indicated."
https://openalex.org/W3101133332,"Background Most people are frequently exposed to chemicals and chemical products. This study provides basic information on the outcomes of acute chemical ingestion of patients aged under 19 years. Methods Patients aged under 19 years who had ingested chemicals and thus visited the emergency department between January 2011 and December 2016 were included in this study. Results In all, 1,247 patients included (1,145 in the unintentional group and 102 in the intentional group). The mean age was 3.27±4.77 in the unintentional ingestion group and 16.49±1.94 in the intentional group. In the unintentional group, detergents were most frequently ingested (by 219 patients), followed by hypochlorite-based agents, ethanol, sodium hydroxide, acetone, silica gel, and citric acid. Cases of boric acid (odds ratio [OR] = 6.131), ethylene glycol (OR = 6.541), glacial acetic acid (OR = 7.644), other hydrocarbons (OR = 4.496), hypochlorite-based agent (OR = 2.627), nicotine (OR = 5.635), and sodium peroxocarbonate (OR = 6.783) ingestion was associated with a significantly high admission rate. In the intentional group, there were 54 cases of ingestion of hypochlorite-based agent, followed by detergent, ethylene glycol, ethanol, methanol and sodium peroxycarbonate. The significant risk factors for admission in the intentional group were ingestion of ethylene glycol (OR = 37.333) and hypochlorite-based agent (OR = 5.026). There was no mortality case. Conclusion The most commonly ingested substances were sodium hypochlorite (hypochlorite-related agent), surfactants (detergent and soap), and ethanol. The ingestion of hypochlorite or ethylene glycol was the main risk factor for admission. Intentional ingestion was higher in adolescents than in children."
https://openalex.org/W3102780495,"Podocytes are highly specialized epithelial cells that are essential for an intact glomerular filtration barrier in the kidney. Several glomerular diseases like focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) are initially due to podocyte injury and loss. Since causative treatments for FSGS are not available until today, drug screening is of great relevance. In order to test a high number of drugs, FSGS needs to be reliably induced in a suitable animal model. The zebrafish larva is an ideal model for kidney research due to the vast amount of offsprings, the rapid development of a simple kidney and a remarkable homology to the mammalian glomerulus. Zebrafish larvae possess a size-selective glomerular filtration barrier at 4 days post fertilization including podocytes with interdigitating foot processes that are connected by a slit membrane. Adriamycin is an anthracycline which is often used in mice and rats to induce a FSGS-like phenotype. In this study, we aimed to induce a similar phenotype to zebrafish larvae by adding adriamycin to the tank water in different concentrations. Surprisingly, zebrafish larvae did not develop glomerular injury and displayed an intact filtration barrier after treatment with adriamycin. This was shown by (immuno-) histology, our filtration assay, in vivo imaging by 2-photon microcopy, RT-(q)PCR as well as transmission electron microscopy. To summarize, adriamycin is unable to induce a podocyte-related damage in zebrafish larvae and therefore major effort must be made to establish FSGS in zebrafish larvae to identify effective drugs by screenings."
https://openalex.org/W3105253691,"Damage assessment is a key element in structural health monitoring of various industrial applications to understand well and predict the response of the material. The big uncertainty in carbon fiber composite materials response is because of variability in the initiation and propagation of damage. Developing advanced tools to design with composite materials, methods for characterizing several damage modes during operation are required. While there is a significant amount of work on the analysis of acoustic emission (AE) from different composite materials and many loading cases, this research focuses on applying an unsupervised clustering method for separating AE data into several groups with distinct evolution. In this paper, we develop an adaptive sampling and unsupervised bivariate data clustering techniques to characterize the several damage initiations of a composite structure in different lay-ups. An adaptive sampling technique pre-processes the AE features and eliminates redundant AE data samples. The reduction of unnecessary AE data depends on the requirements of the proposed bivariate data clustering technique. The bivariate data clustering technique groups the AE data (dependent variable) with respect to the mechanical data (independent variable) to assess the damage of the composite structure. Tensile experiments on carbon fiber reinforced composite laminates (CFRP) in different orientations are carried out to collect mechanical and AE data and demonstrate the damage modes. Based on the mechanical stress-strain data, the results show the dominant damage regions in different lay-ups of specimens and the definition of the different states of damage. In addition, the states of the damage are observed using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis. Based on the AE data, the results show that the strong linear correlation between AE and mechanical energy, and the classification of various modes of damage in all lay-ups of specimens forming clusters of AE energy with respect to the mechanical energy. Furthermore, the validation of the cluster-based characterization and improvement of the sensitivity of the damage modes classification are observed by the combined knowledge of AE and mechanical energy and time-frequency spectrum analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3106004412,"Facilitation by tussocks is common in high-altitude tropical environments. It is thought that facilitation results from stress amelioration, but it is unclear which of the many stressors acting in these environments is ameliorated. We aimed at determining the relative importance of different stressors as drivers of facilitation by the tussock Festuca tolucensis in Mexico. We employed eight experimental treatments to manipulate five stressors in the field: minimum temperatures by using electric radiators that kept plants warm; maximum temperatures by means of reflective sand that precluded temperature build-up during the day; UV radiation by using screens opaque to UV; poor soil properties by comparing soils from beneath tussocks and from bare ground; and low water availability by adding vermiculite to the soil. The performance (survival and growth) of Mexerion sarmentosum (a plant usually associated with Festuca ) in these treatments was compared to that recorded under tussocks and in bare ground. Amelioration of extreme temperatures had the largest positive effects on Mexerion survival. UV radiation and increased soil humidity did not affect survival, although humidity increased growth rates. Nevertheless, tussocks reduced the growth of Mexerion , which is consistent with observations of competition between plants and soil microorganisms favoured by tussocks. Our results highlight the importance of the extreme daily fluctuations in temperature that characterise tropical mountains as fundamental drivers of their dynamics."
