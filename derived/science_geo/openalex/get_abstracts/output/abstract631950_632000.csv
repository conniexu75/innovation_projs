https://openalex.org/W2940452045,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated effective anti-tumour response in cancer types with high mutation burden (e.g. melanoma) and in subset of cancers with features of genomic instability (e.g. mismatch-repair deficiency). One possible explanation for this effect is the increased expression of immune checkpoint molecules and pre-existing adaptive immune response in these cancers. Given that BRCA1 and BRCA2 are integral in maintaining genomic integrity, we hypothesise that the inactivation of these genes may give rise to breast cancers with such immunogenic phenotype. Therefore, using two large series of publicly available breast cancer datasets, namely that from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Wellcome Trust Institute, we sought to investigate the association between BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficiency with features of genomic instability, expression of PD-L1 and PD-1, landscape of inferred tumour-infiltrating immune cells, and T-cell inflamed signature in breast cancers. Here, we report that BRCA1 and BRCA2-deficient breast cancers were associated with features of genomic instability including increased mutation burden. Interestingly, BRCA1-, but not BRCA2-, deficient breast cancers were associated with increased expression of PD-L1 and PD-1, higher abundance of tumour-infiltrating immune cells, and enrichment of T cell-inflamed signature. The differences in immunophenotype between BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient breast cancers can be attributed, in part, to PTEN gene mutation. Therefore, features of genomic instability such as that mediated by BRCA1- and BRCA2- deficiency in breast cancer were necessary, but not always sufficient, for yielding T cell-inflamed tumour microenvironment, and by extension, predicting clinical benefit from immunotherapy."

We aimed to determine the effects of intranasal insulin (INI) on cognition and motor performance in PD. This was a proof of concept, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the effects of 40 international units (IU) of insulin or saline once daily for four weeks on cognitive and functional performance. Of 16 subjects enrolled, eight in the INI group and six in the placebo group completed verbal fluency (FAS), Unified Parkinson Disease Scale (UPDRS), and modified Hoehn and Yahr scale (HY, PD severity) at baseline and post-treatment and were included in the analyses. After treatment, the INI group had a better total FAS score (p = 0.02) (41 ± 8.2 vs. 30.8 ± 7.1, mean ±SD, p = 0.02) compared to the placebo group. The INI group also had improved HY (p = 0.04) and UPDRS-Motor (Part III) (p = 0.02) scores when compared to baseline. One INI treated patient with multiple system atrophy (MSA) remained stable and did not show disease progression. The placebo group had no change. INI administration was well tolerated and there were no hypoglycemic episodes or serious study related adverse events or medications interactions. INI is safe in PD and MSA patients and may provide clinically relevant functional improvement. Larger studies are warranted to determine the INI effect in treatment of cognitive and motor impairment in Parkinson disease. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrial.gov NCT02064166."
https://openalex.org/W2940482405,"Most of the Parkinson’s disease (PD) cases are sporadic, although several genes are directly related to PD. Several pathways are central in PD pathogenesis: protein aggregation linked to proteasomal impairments, mitochondrial dysfunctions and impairment in dopamine (DA) release. Here we studied the close crossing of mitochondrial dysfunction and aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) and in the extension in the dopaminergic neuronal death. Here, using rat primary cultures of mesencephalic neurons, we induced the mitochondrial impairments using “DA-toxins” (MPP+, 6OHDA, rotenone). We showed that the DA-Toxins induced dopaminergic cell death through different pathways: caspase-dependent cell death for 6OHDA; MPP+ stimulated caspase-independent cell death, and rotenone activated both pathways. In addition, a decrease in energy production and/or a development of oxidative stress were observed and were linked to α-syn aggregation with generation of Lewy body-like inclusions (found inside and outside the dopaminergic neurons). We demonstrated that any of induced mitochondrial disturbances and processes of death led to α-syn protein aggregation and finally to cell death. Our study depicts the cell death mechanisms taking place in in vitro models of Parkinson’s disease and how mitochondrial dysfunctions is at the cross road of the pathologies of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2941671935,"Early initiation of breastfeeding (EIBF) is associated with better health of the mothers and reduced risk of neonatal mortality. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of EIBF and associated factors among Bangladeshi mothers.The data was extracted from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS)-2014. A total of 4,092 married non-pregnant Bangladeshi mothers who had at least one child aged 2 years or younger were included in this study. A two-level logistic regression model was used to remove the clustering effect for finding the impact of socio-economic and demographic factors on EIBF.The prevalence of EIBF among Bangladeshi mothers was 51.4% (urban: 47.1% and rural: 53.4%). A two -level logistic regression model showed that mothers living in the Sylhet division (p<0.01) and rural environment (p<0.05) were more likely to practice EIBF. Mothers who were obese or overweight (p<0.01), had secondary (p<0.05) or higher education (p<0.01) were less likely to provide early breastfeeding to their newborn babies compared to their counterparts. Those who delivered by caesarian-section (p<0.01) were less likely to perform EIBF while those who attended an antenatal care clinic more than 3 times (p<0.05) were more likely to do so.About half of the Bangladeshi mothers did not start breast-feeding within one hour after birth. This study identified several geographical and socio-demographic factors that were associated with EIBF, and hope that this information will help the government to focus their resources to promote early breastfeeding."
https://openalex.org/W2942256047,"β-(1→3)-D-Glucan is an essential component of the fungal cell wall. Mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against synthetic nona-β-(1→3)-D-glucoside conjugated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) were generated using hybridoma technology. The affinity constants of two selected mAbs, 3G11 and 5H5, measured by a surface plasmon resonance biosensor assay using biotinylated nona-β-(1→3)-D-glucan as the ligand, were approximately 11 nM and 1.9 nM, respectively. The glycoarray, which included a series of synthetic oligosaccharide derivatives representing β-glucans with different lengths of oligo-β-(1→3)-D-glucoside chains, demonstrated that linear tri-, penta- and nonaglucoside, as well as a β-(1→6)-branched octasaccharide, were recognized by mAb 5H5. By contrast, only linear oligo-β-(1→3)-D-glucoside chains that were not shorter than pentaglucosides (but not the branched octaglucoside) were ligands for mAb 3G11. Immunolabelling indicated that 3G11 and 5H5 interact with both yeasts and filamentous fungi, including species from Aspergillus, Candida, Penicillium genera and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but not bacteria. Both mAbs could inhibit the germination of Aspergillus fumigatus conidia during the initial hours and demonstrated synergy with the antifungal fluconazole in killing C. albicans in vitro. In addition, mAbs 3G11 and 5H5 demonstrated protective activity in in vivo experiments, suggesting that these β-glucan-specific mAbs could be useful in combinatorial antifungal therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2942215430,"Previous studies have attempted to assess the role of health insurance on health care utilization in African settings. However, there is limited evidence on the effects of health insurance on use of maternal health care. In the present study our objective was to measure the prevalence of insurance ownership, types of services covered by the insurance and the association of insurance ownership with the utilization of respective maternal health services in Ghana.This study was based on nationally representative Demographic and Health Survey in Ghana (GDHS 2014) encompassing 4,293 mothers aged 15-49 years. Outcome variables were use of early antenatal care (ANC), facility delivery, and postnatal care (PNC) for mothers and children, and the explanatory variables were insurance coverage for these services. Associations were analysed using logistic regression models whilst controlling for potentially confounding variables.Prevalence of health insurance ownership was 66.8% (95%CI = 64.5-68.9) with significant socioeconomic disparities. The prevalence was higher particularly among women who were urban residents, had higher educational and wealth status. In general, insurance coverage for services such as ANC, childbirth and postnatal care was higher in rural areas, but that of cash benefit was higher in urban areas. Findings of multivariate analysis indicated that women who had their ANC services covered had significantly higher odds of attending at least one and four ANC visits, as well as receiving PNC for child. Insurance coverage for childbirth services showed significant association with the PNC for child, not with choice of health facility delivery. Women who had cash benefit were twice as likely to use early ANC visit (OR = 2.046, p<0.05), facility delivery (OR = 1.449, p<0.05), and PNC for mother (OR = 1.290, p<0.05).Overall prevalence of health insurance coverage has increased since 2008, with significant disparities across demographic and socioeconomic groups. Insurance ownership for different types of maternal health services showed positive association with service uptake, with exceptions for place of delivery, indicating that insurance coverage alone may not be able to promote facility delivery. More studies are required to measure the progress in maternal healthcare utilisation through the insurance programmes."
https://openalex.org/W2941219212,"Canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) is a syndrome where multiple viral and bacterial pathogens are involved sequentially or synergistically to cause illness. There is limited information regarding the prevalence of pathogens related to CIRD in the United States as well as the role of co-infections in the pathogenesis of the syndrome. We aimed to conduct a comprehensive etiologic and epidemiologic study of multiple CIRD agents in a diverse dog population using molecular methods and statistical modeling analyses. In addition, a novel probe-based multiplex real-time PCR was developed to simultaneously detect and differentiate two species of Mycoplasma (M. canis and M. cynos). Canine adenovirus, canine distemper virus, canine parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, influenza A virus (H3N2 and H3N8), Bordetella bronchiseptica, M. canis, M. cynos and Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus were investigated in specimens from clinically ill and asymptomatic dogs received at the Athens Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Results showed low occurrence of classical CIRD agents such as B. bronchiseptica, canine adenovirus and distemper virus, while highlighting the potential role of emerging bacteria such as M. canis and M. cynos. Statistical modeling analyses of CIRD pathogens emphasized the impact of co-infections on the severity of clinical presentation, and showed that host factors, such as animal age, are the most important predictors of disease severity. This study provides new insights into the current understanding of the prevalence and role of co-infections with selected viruses and bacteria in the etiology of CIRD, while underscoring the importance of molecular diagnosis and vaccination against this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2940633975,"Pharmacists' knowledge about the clinical and legal aspects of antibiotic supply has an impact on appropriate dispensing practice. There are limited studies evaluating community pharmacists' knowledge of antibiotic dispensing in low and middle-income countries, including Sri Lanka. We aimed (i) to evaluate community pharmacy staff's self-reported knowledge about antibiotics and dispensing behaviour of antibiotics without a prescription, and (ii) to identify possible factors impacting their antibiotic dispensing behaviour.A cross-sectional survey was conducted among a random sample (n = 369) of community pharmacies across all nine provinces in Sri Lanka using a self-administered questionnaire on their antibiotic knowledge and dispensing practice. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics including; t-test, one-way ANOVA or chi-square test, and binary and multiple logistic regression.A total of 265 pharmacy staff (210 (79%) pharmacists and 55 (21%) assistants) responded. Overall mean antibiotic knowledge score was 26.1 (SD 3.9; range 1-33, max possible score 34). The overall mean knowledge score t(263) = 2.41, p = 0.017, specific knowledge about antibiotic resistance (ABR) t(262) = 4.98, p = 0.021 and legal aspects of antibiotic dispensing χ2(1, N = 265) = 8.55, p = 0.003) were significantly higher among pharmacists than assistants. One in every three pharmacy staff reported that they dispensed antibiotics without a prescription on patient request; however the proportion was close to half when the patient was known to them. About 30% of the staff reported to have supplied antibiotics for minor infections in the week prior to the survey. However, there was no significant difference in the supply between pharmacists and assistants except for acute sore throat (12% vs 23%, respectively; p = 0.040). Those pharmacists with higher ABR knowledge were less likely to give out antibiotics without a prescription for viral infections in adults (Adj. OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55-0.96; p = 0.027) and children (Adj. OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.38-0.80; p = 0.002). Awareness of legal aspects of antibiotic supply reduced overall dispensing (Adj. OR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.30-0.75; p = 0.001), and specifically for bacterial infections in adults (Adj. OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.20-0.99; p = 0.047). Knowledge about antibiotic use and misuse reduced the likelihood of illegal dispensing for common cold (Adj. OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.60-0.94; p = 0.011) and acute diarrhoea (Adj. OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.58-0.99; p = 0.048).Despite the law prohibiting provision, antibiotic dispensing without a prescription continues in community pharmacies in Sri Lanka. Appropriate antibiotic dispensing was associated with high levels of pharmacists' legal and clinical knowledge about antibiotics. Strategies to change the current practice are urgently needed."

Infection capability of the phages was optimum at 30-35°C and in alkali condition with optimum at pH 10-12. Structural protein profiles and restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses patterns were distinct for each of the phage type. Complete nucleotide sequences of phages vB-VmeM-32, vB_EauS-123 and vB_BhaS-171 genomes varied in size from 30,926-199,912 bp and G + C content of between 36.25-47.73%. A range of 56-260 potential open reading frames were identified and annotated. The results showed that the 12 phages were distinct from each other and confirmed the presence and diversity of phages in extreme environment of haloalkaline Lake Elmenteita. The phages were deposited at the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures and three of their genomes uploaded to NCBI GenBank."
https://openalex.org/W2940947323,"Objective Identify the socio-economic correlates of sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption among pregnant women and analyze to what extent SSB consumption is associated with diet quality and total energy intake. Additionally, we aim to predict how diet quality scores and totally energy intakes would change if SSB consumption was artificially set to 0. Design Repeated Cross Sectional Study. Setting United States. Subjects SSB consumption was estimated from 1–2 24-hour dietary recalls from 1,154 pregnant women who participated in the 1999–2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Methods Linear regression models were used to identify socioeconomic and demographic factors associated with SSB consumption and to assess the associations between SSB consumption and diet quality and total energy intake. Diet quality was measured with the Alternate Healthy Eating Index modified for Pregnancy (AHEI-P). Results The mean SSB intake was 1.3 servings per day (sd 1.5). Having a household income ≤100% of the Federal Poverty Level, being born in the United States, and not being married or living with a partner were positively associated with SSB consumption. Every 12 oz. of SSBs consumed was associated with a 2.3 lower AHEI-P score (95% CI: 1.6, 2.9) and the consumption of 124 more calories (95% CI: 85, 163), after adjusting for age, country of birth, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, marital status, household income, survey year and day/s of the week the recall/s were collected. Our predictive models indicated that average AHEI-P would be 6.4 (5.4, 7.6) higher and average total energy intakes would be 203.5 calories (122.2, 284.8) lower if SSB intake was set to 0. Conclusions SSB consumption is associated with poorer diet quality and higher total energy intake among pregnant women."
https://openalex.org/W2941933783,"Background Although electrolyte imbalances (EIs) are common in the emergency department (ED), few studies have examined the occurrence of such conditions in an unselected population. Objectives To investigate the frequency of EI among adult patients who present to the ED, with regards to type and severity, and the association with age and sex of the patient, hospital length of stay (LOS), readmission, and mortality. Methods A retrospective cohort study. All patients ≥18 years referred for any reason to the ED between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015, who had measured blood electrolytes were included. In total, 62 991 visits involving 31 966 patients were registered. Results EIs were mostly mild, and the most common EI was hyponatremia (glucose-corrected) (24.6%). Patients with increasing severity of EI had longer LOS compared with patients with normal electrolyte measurements. Among all admitted patients, there were 12928 (20.5%) readmissions within 30 days from discharge during the study period. Hyponatremia (glucose-corrected) was associated with readmission, with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.25 (95% CI, 1.18–1.32). Hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia (albumin-corrected) were also associated with readmission, with ORs of 1.25 (95% CI, 1.07–1.45) and 1.22 (95% CI, 1.02–1.46), respectively. Dysnatremia, dyskalemia, hypercalcemia, hypermagnesemia, and hyperphosphatemia were associated with increased in-hospital mortality, whereas all EIs except hypophosphatemia were associated with increased 30-day and 1-year mortality. Conclusions EIs were common and increasing severity of EIs was associated with longer LOS and increased in-hospital, 30-days and 1-year mortality. EI monitoring is crucial for newly admitted patients, and up-to-date training in EI diagnosis and treatment is essential for ED physicians."
https://openalex.org/W2941279955,"Clinical courses and treatment outcomes are largely unknown in patients with adult-onset immunodeficiency associated with anti-interferon-gamma autoantibodies due to the fact that it was recently recognized and anti-IFN-γ auto-Abs detection is not widely available.Non-HIV-infected adult patients with detectable anti-IFN-γ auto-Abs diagnosed and followed at Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand during January 2013 to November 2016 were prospectively studied. At each follow-up visit, patients were classified as stable or active disease according to symptoms and signs, and all proven OIs were recorded. Laboratory parameters, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and anti-IFN-γ auto-Abs level, were compared between active and stable disease episodes. We identified 80 patients with this clinical syndrome and followed them up during study period. Seventy-nine patients developed overall 194 proven opportunistic infections. Mycobacterium abscessus (34.5%) and Salmonella spp. (23.2%) were the two most common pathogens identified among these patients. Sixty-three patients were followed for a median of 2.7 years (range 0.6-4.8 years). Eleven (17.5%) patients achieved the drug-free remission period for at least 9 months. Four patients died. Anti-IFN-γ auto-Abs concentration was significantly lower at baseline and decreased over time in the drug-free remission group compared to another group (p = 0.001). C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and white cell count were found to be useful biomarkers for determining disease activity during follow-up.Reinfection or relapse of OIs is common despite long-term antimicrobial treatment in patients with anti-IFN-γ auto-Abs. Treatment to modify anti-IFN-γ auto-Abs production may improve long-term outcomes in this patient population."
https://openalex.org/W2941964428,"Background Health care associated urinary tract infections (HAUTI) is a common complicating factor of urological practice. It is unclear what the appropriate empirical antibiotic choices are and how infection control policies (ICP) influence this. The aim of this study is to use probabilistic approaches towards the problem. That is to determine the chances of coverage of empirical antibiotic choices in HAUTIs and their annual trends in Europe. In addition, the impact of departmental self-reported compliance with catheter management and regulated usage of prophylactic antibiotics policies was tested. The estimated chances of coverage of antibiotics and further probabilistic calculations are carried out using the Global Prevalence of Infections in Urology (GPIU) annual surveillance study European data. Methods GPIU is a multi-state annual prevalence study conducted in urology departments to detect patients with HAUTIs, using the Center for Disease Control (CDC) definitions and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In this analysis; the European cohort from 2005 to 2015 was used. The estimated chance of coverage for each antibiotic choice in HAUTIs was calculated using the Bayesian Weighted Incidence Syndromic Antibiogram (WISCA) approach. Annual trend of the overall cohort and number of appropriate antibiotic choices were estimated. Departments were compared according to their self-reported compliance to ICPs to determine if there was an impact on chances of coverage and appropriate antibiotic choices. Results We estimated that in most study years less than half of the single agent antibiotics and all combination options were appropriate for empirical treatment of HAUTIs. Departments with compliance to both ICPs were estimated to have 66%(2006) to 44% (2015) more antibiotic choices compared to departments with complete lack of compliance to the ICPs. In our estimates departments with adherence to a single policy was not superior to departments with complete lack of adherence to ICPs. Conclusions Most single agent choices had limited coverage for HAUTIs and combination choices had improved chance of coverage. Optimal antibiotic selection decision should be part of decision experiments and tested in local surveillance studies. Departments with self-reported compliance to ICPs have more antibiotic choices and details of the compliance should be evaluated in future studies. The analysis herein showed that over the 10-year course there was no clear time trend in the chances of coverage of antibiotics (Bayesian WISCA) in European urology departments."
https://openalex.org/W2940715158,"The study of optimal best practice within the context of academia has produced both empirical and theoretical contributions. Optimal best practice, also coined as optimal functioning, is concerned with a person's personal best-that is, ""what is the best that I can do for this academic subject?"" Research in the social sciences has, to date, explored different types of optimal best-physical, cognitive, emotional, and social. What is of considerable interest, as a related matter, is a question of how a person reaches and experiences a level of optimal best practice. Recent research development, for example, has explored various conceptualizations of optimal best practice-for example, one distinctive theoretical model, the Framework of Achievement Bests [1, 2], makes a concerted effort to explore the underlying process of optimization-that is, in this case, how an optimal level of best practice is achieved. The present study, as detailed below, investigates via means of non-experimental data a theoretical model pertaining to the achievement of optimal best practice. This examination, we postulate, would enable us to add clarity and provide additional theoretical insights the operational nature of the process of optimization. The operational nature of optimization, as described in our recent research [1, 3], emphasizes three major tenets: (i) the main sources of a person's optimal best practice, (ii) the potential 'optimizing' influences of three comparable agencies on the achievement of optimal best practice (i.e., personal resolve, social relationship, and personal self-efficacy), and (iii) the impact of optimal best practice on future adaptive outcomes (i.e., academic striving and personal well-being). We explored this topic via means of the use of a non-experimental, correlational design with participants drawn from Taiwanese university students (N = 1010). Structural equation modelling (SEM) produced evidence, which empirically supported existing research [1, 3] and substantiated our knowledge of the concept of optimal best practice. Evidence established from the present study has also assisted us to identify one pervasive issue, which we call for further research development-namely, to consider, design, and develop an appropriate methodological approach that would enable researchers to accurately measure and assess the process of optimization. Finally, in terms of teaching and learning, we acknowledge that our research investigation has provided some insights into potential educational practices for implementation."
https://openalex.org/W2941727313,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the safety of the probiotic strain Bacillus toyonensis BCT-7112T (active ingredient of Toyocerin) in relation to the enterotoxins haemolysin BL (Hbl) and the non-haemolytic enterotoxin (Nhe) by performing a quantitative reverse transcription (RT) real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a Western blot assay. The expression levels of the enterotoxin genes hblA, hblD, nheA, nheB and nheC, determined by means of RT real-time PCR in B. toyonensis, were lower than those in B. cereus reference strains. No expression of hblC was detected. The Western blot assays of native and 25-fold concentrated supernatants from B. toyonensis, using monoclonal antibodies directed against the Hbl component L1 and the Nhe component NheB, showed weak bands. The NheC component was not detected in the native supernatant, but weakly in the 25-fold concentrated supernatant. According to the results of the present study, the enterotoxin expression and protein levels of B. toyonensis BCT-7112T were absent or clearly lower compared to the B. cereus reference strains. Thus, their ability to form functional enterotoxins can also be considered to be lower or unlikely compared to the B. cereus reference strains. This experimental approach can be implemented when studying the health and safety as well as harmlessness of probiotic microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W2953128267,"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious viral disease that severely impacts global food security and is one of the greatest constraints on international trade of animal products. Extensive viral population diversity and rapid, continuous mutation of circulating FMD viruses (FMDVs) pose significant obstacles to the control and ultimate eradication of this important transboundary pathogen. The current study investigated mechanisms contributing to within-host evolution of FMDV in a natural host species (cattle). Specifically, vaccinated and non-vaccinated cattle were infected with FMDV under controlled, experimental conditions and subsequently sampled for up to 35 days to monitor viral genomic changes as related to phases of disease and experimental cohorts. Consensus-level genomic changes across the entire FMDV coding region were characterized through three previously defined stages of infection: early, transitional, and persistent. The overall conclusion was that viral evolution occurred via a combination of two mechanisms: emergence of full-genomic minority haplotypes from within the inoculum super-swarm, and concurrent continuous point mutations. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that individuals were infected with multiple distinct haplogroups that were pre-existent within the ancestral inoculum used to infect all animals. Multiple shifts of dominant viral haplotype took place during the early and transitional phases of infection, whereas few shifts occurred during persistent infection. Overall, this work suggests that the establishment of the carrier state is not associated with specific viral genomic characteristics. These insights into FMDV population dynamics have important implications for virus sampling methodology and molecular epidemiology."
https://openalex.org/W2942322200,"Many acute cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction (MI) follow circadian rhythms. Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) is a newly noticed entity with limited data on onset pattern and its impact on prognosis.In this observational study of Swedish MINOCA patients registered in the SWEDEHEART registry between 2003-2013 and followed until December 2013 we identified 9,092 unique patients with MINOCA out of 199,163 MI admissions in total. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated for whole hours, parts of the day, weekdays, months, seasons and major holidays.The mean age was 65.5 years, 62.0% were women and 16.6% presented with STEMI. The risk for MINOCA proved to be most common in the morning (IRR = 1.70, 95% CI [1.63-1.84]) with a peak at 08.00 AM (IRR = 2.25, 95% CI [1.96-2.59]) and on Mondays (IRR = 1.28, 95% CI [1.18-1.38]). No altered risk was detected during the different seasons, the Christmas and New Year holidays or the Swedish Midsummer festivities. There was no association between time of onset of MINOCA and short- or long-term prognosis.The onset of MINOCA shows a circadian and circaseptan variation with increased risk at early mornings and Mondays, similar to previous studies on all MI, suggesting stress related triggering. However, during holidays were traditional MI increase, we did not see any increase for MINOCA. No association was detected between time of onset and prognosis, indicating that the underlying pathological mechanisms of MINOCA and the quality of care are similar at different times of onset but triggering mechanism may be more active early mornings and Mondays."
https://openalex.org/W2950078408,"Rich geochemical datasets generated over the past 30 years have provided fine-scale resolution on the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM) coastal hypoxic (≤ 2 mg of O2 L-1) zone. In contrast, little is known about microbial community structure and activity in the hypoxic zone despite the implication that microbial respiration is responsible for forming low dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions. Here, we hypothesized that the extent of the hypoxic zone is a driver in determining microbial community structure, and in particular, the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA). Samples collected across the shelf for two consecutive hypoxic seasons in July 2013 and 2014 were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, oligotyping, microbial co-occurrence analysis, and quantification of thaumarchaeal 16S rRNA and archaeal ammonia-monooxygenase (amoA) genes. In 2014 Thaumarchaeota were enriched and inversely correlated with DO while Cyanobacteria, Acidimicrobiia, and Proteobacteria where more abundant in oxic samples compared to hypoxic. Oligotyping analysis of Nitrosopumilus 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that one oligotype was significantly inversely correlated with DO in both years. Oligotyping analysis revealed single nucleotide variation among all Nitrosopumilaceae, including Nitrosopumilus 16S rRNA gene sequences, with one oligotype possibly being better adapted to hypoxia. We further provide evidence that in the hypoxic zone of both year 2013 and 2014, low DO concentrations and high Thaumarchaeota abundances influenced microbial co-occurrence patterns. Taken together, the data demonstrated that the extent of hypoxic conditions could potentially drive patterns in microbial community structure, with two years of data revealing the annual nGOM hypoxic zone to be emerging as a low DO adapted AOA hotspot."
https://openalex.org/W2940657907,"The production of maple syrup is an important cultural and economic activity directly related to the climate of northeastern North America. As a result, there are signs that climate change could have negative impacts on maple syrup production in the next decades, particularly for regions located at the southern margins of the sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) range. The purpose of this survey study is to present the beliefs and opinions of maple syrup producers of Canada (N = 241) and the U.S. (N = 113) on climate change in general, its impacts on sugar maple health and maple syrup production, and potential adaptation measures. Using conditional inference classification trees, we examined how the socio-economic profile of respondents and the geographic location and size of respondents’ sugar bushes shaped the responses of survey participants. While a majority (75%) of respondents are confident that the average temperature on Earth is increasing, less than half (46%) believe that climate change will have negative impacts on maple syrup yield in the next 30 years. Political view was a significant predictor of these results, with respondents at the right right and center-right of the political spectrum being less likely to believe in climate change and less likely to anticipate negative effects of climate change on maple syrup production. In addition, 77% of the participants indicated an interest in adopting adaptation strategies if those could increase maple syrup production. This interest was greater for respondents using vacuum tubing for sap collection than other collection methods. However, for many respondents (particularly in Canada), lack of information was identified as a constraint limiting adaptation to climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2940518288,"Lucanus cervus (L.), the stag beetle, is a saproxylic beetle species distributed widely across Europe. Throughout its distribution the species has exhibited pronounced declines and is widely considered threatened. Conservation efforts may be hindered by the lack of population genetic data and understanding of the spatial scale of population connectivity. To address this knowledge gap this research details the first broad scale phylogeographic study of L. cervus based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing and microsatellite analysis of samples collected from 121 localities across Europe. Genetic data were complemented by palaeo-distribution models of spatial occupancy during the Last Glacial Maximum to strengthen inferences of refugial areas. A salient feature of the mtDNA was the identification of two lineages. Lineage I was widespread across Europe while lineage II was confined to Greece. Microsatellites supported the differentiation of the Greek samples and alongside palaeo-distribution models indicated this area was a glacial refuge. The genetic endemism of the Greek samples, and demographic results compatible with no signatures of spatial expansion likely reflects restricted dispersal into and out of the area. Lineage I exhibited a shallow star like phylogeny compatible with rapid population expansion across Europe. Demographic analysis indicated such expansions occurred after the Last Glacial Maximum. Nuclear diversity and hindcast species distribution models indicated a central Italian refuge for lineage I. Palaeo-distribution modelling results also suggested a western refuge in northern Iberia and south-west France. In conclusion the results provide evidence of glacial divergence in stag beetle while also suggesting high, at least on evolutionary timescales, gene flow across most of Europe. The data also provide a neutral genetic framework against which patterns of phenotypic variation may be assessed."
https://openalex.org/W2942378995,"The massive reach of social networks (SNs) has hidden their potential concerns, primarily those related to information privacy. Users increasingly rely on social networks for more than merely interactions and self-representation. However, social networking environments are not free of risks. Users are often threatened by privacy breaches, unauthorized access to personal information, and leakage of sensitive data. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving model that sanitizes the collection of user information from a social network utilizing restricted local differential privacy (LDP) to save synthetic copies of collected data. This model further uses reconstructed data to classify user activity and detect abnormal network behavior. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high data utility on the basis of improved privacy preservation. Moreover, LDP sanitized data are suitable for use in subsequent analyses, such as anomaly detection. Anomaly detection on the proposed method’s reconstructed data achieves a detection accuracy similar to that on the original data."
https://openalex.org/W2949179348,"Purpose To compare corneal biomechanics between patients with ocular graft versus-host disease (oGVHD) and healthy subjects (controls), and to further correlate these values with ocular and hematological characteristics. Materials and methods The following procedures were performed in oGVHD patients and controls: Schirmer test (ST), break-up time (BUT), corneal and conjunctival staining, tear matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) assay (InflammaDry test, Rapid Pathogen Screening, Inc, Sarasota, FL). Corneal biomechanics were calculated by using ocular response analyzer (ORA, Reichert Instruments, Depew, New York, USA). The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare continuous variables between oGVHD patients and controls. Correlations of corneal biomechanics with ocular and hematological parameters were examined using Spearman's correlation. Results A total of 45 oGVHD patients (mean age ± SD, 51.5 ± 7.1 years) and 34 controls (47.8 ± 6.1 years) were included. Patients with oGVHD showed significantly lower values of corneal hysteresis (CH) and corneal resistance factor (CRF) compared to controls (respectively, 9.4 ± 1.8 mmHg vs 11.6 ± 1.6 and 9.7 ± 1.4 mmHg vs 12.3 ± 1.3; always p<0.001). Twenty-nine of the oGVHD eyes (64.4%) were strong-positive for MMP-9, while 16 (35.6%) were weak-positive. Conversely, only 4 of the control eyes (11.8%) were weak-positive for MMP-9. In patients with oGVHD, CH was significantly correlated with corneal staining (Rs = -0.316, p = 0.035), conjunctival staining (Rs = -0.437, p = 0.003), ST (Rs = 0.390, p = 0.008), BUT (Rs = 0.423, p = 0.004), oGVHD severity grade (Rs = -0.383, p = 0.009), and MMP-9 positivity grade (Rs = -0.429, p = 0.003), while CRF was correlated only with corneal staining (Rs = -0.317, p = 0.034). Conclusions Corneal biomechanics are reduced in patients with oGVHD, and CH is negatively correlated with disease severity grade and MMP-9 tear levels."
https://openalex.org/W2941093422,"Introduction In France, midwives have been authorized to prescribe vaccines since 2016. Yet vaccination coverage among pregnant women remains low. Understanding the knowledge, attitudes and practices of midwives regarding influenza vaccination could help improve coverage. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2017 among midwives practicing in the public and private sectors in Paris using an online questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of the data was conducted. Results The response rate was 31% (n = 208/669). Overall, knowledge of influenza vaccine recommendations and of vaccine safety and effectiveness was high except regarding new-born immunity and influenza vaccine characteristics. Only 10% of midwives systematically prescribed the vaccine. Reported influenza vaccine uptake among midwives was 39%. Conclusion Efforts to improve the knowledge of midwives regarding the safety and effectiveness of vaccinating pregnant women in order to prevent influenza infection in newborns are necessary. Increasing vaccine uptake in both midwives and pregnant women will require adjusting education strategies."

However, there is little information in the literature on the longitudinal stability of these widely used biomarkers. In a large clinical trial involving 10 institutional sites, smokers were given, free of charge over a period of 20 weeks, Spectrum NRC600/601 research cigarettes containing 15.5 mg nicotine/g tobacco. All participants were instructed to smoke these cigarettes for the duration of the study. At weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20, first morning urine voids were collected and analyzed for 8-iso-PGF2α and PGE-M using validated liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry methods. The mean level of 8-iso-PGF2α at Week 4 was 1.34 ± 1.08 (S.D.) pmol/mg creatinine (N = 226) while that of PGE-M was 73.7 ± 113 (S.D.) pmol/mg creatinine (N = 232). The corresponding levels at Week 20 were 1.35 ± 0.93 (S.D.) pmol/mg creatinine (N = 209) for 8-iso-PGF2α and 74.2 ± 142 (S.D.) pmol/mg creatinine (N = 210) for PGE-M. There was variation in these values in the intervening weeks. The intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were 0.51 (95% CI, 0.45, 0.57) and 0.36 (0.30, 0.43), for 8-iso-PGF2α and PGE-M, respectively, indicating fair longitudinal stability for 8-iso-PGF2α and poorer longitudinal stability for PGE-M in cigarette smokers. Males had higher ICC values than females for both 8-iso-PGF2α and PGE-M. These results indicate that, in addition to cigarette smoking, endogenous processes of oxidative damage and inflammation influence the levels of these biomarkers over time among current smokers."

https://openalex.org/W2940996567,"The threats posed by neonicotinoid insecticides to bee populations have been the focus of considerable research. Previous work has shed new light on the effects of neonicotinoids on bees by uncovering pathways through which neonicotinoids affect bee population dynamics and the potential interactions they have with exogenous stressors. Yet, little is known about whether these effects translate in a field-relevant setting to substantial losses in honey yields for commercial beekeepers. Here, we used data from a 6-year survey of 60 apiaries in Greece and economic modelling to assess at the field level the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on honey production. Based on production function estimates, we found that sub-lethal concentrations of two widely used neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) detected in the nectar of flowers resulted in substantial losses in honey production for commercial beekeepers in our sample. By simulating a scenario with ideal pathogenic and environmental conditions, we found that the magnitude of the neonicotinoid effects decreases significantly under ideal conditions providing evidence for possible synergies at the field between neonicotinoids and environmental and pathogenic factors. Moreover, in a replicated study with grouped apiaries, we found evidence that the marginal effects of neonicotinoids on honey production vary across apiaries facing different conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2942174959,"IL-33 promotes type 2 immunity, epithelial repair, and tissue fibrosis by activating group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2). ILC2 lack all known surface markers of mature T, B, NK, and myeloid cell lineages (Linneg), express the IL-33 receptor ST2, and release type 2 cytokines which contribute to cholangiocyte proliferation and activation of hepatic stellate cells. This pathway results in massive proliferation of the extrahepatic bile duct (EHBD) but also exacerbates liver fibrosis, suggesting that there may be tissue-specific subpopulations of IL-33-induced ILC. To determine the tissue-specific subsets of ILC in the hepatobiliary system, we analyzed CD45+Linneg mononuclear cells from IL-33 treated adult Balb/c mouse liver or EHBD by single cell RNA sequencing. Principal component analysis identified 6 major CD45+Linneg cell classes, two of which were restricted to the EHBD. One of these classes, biliary immature myeloid (BIM) cells, was predicted to interact with ILC2 by a network of shared receptor-ligand pairs. BIM highly expressed Gp49 and ST2 receptors on the cell surface while lacking surface expression of markers for mature myeloid cells. In conclusion, single cell RNA sequencing identified IL-33 responsive cell groups regionally confined to the liver or extrahepatic bile duct, including a novel population of CD45+Linneg Gp49-expressing mononuclear cells."
https://openalex.org/W2941756495,"Nephrotoxicity is a well-known side effect of cisplatin for cancer treatment. Various regimens have been developed to treat cancer based on the type and severity of the tumor. We focus on the docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil regimen, which is called the TPF regimen, where the standard dose of cisplatin is 60 mg/m2. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship of the dosage of cisplatin that causes nephrotoxicity and back ground factors of patients using information about the dose of cisplatin actually administered to patients. It is shown that nephrotoxicity may be caused by a substantially smaller dosage than the standard dose of cisplatin in the TPF regimen, indicating the need for dose adjustment, taking into account the patient’s background factors in the treatment of a cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2941997115,"Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-technology is an important platform in medicine and disease modeling. Physiological degeneration and disease onset are common occurrences in the aging population. iPSCs could offer regenerative medical options for age-related degeneration and disease in the elderly. However, reprogramming somatic cells from the elderly is inefficient when successful at all. Perhaps due to their low rates of replication in culture, traditional transduction and reprogramming approaches with centenarian fibroblasts met with little success. A simple and reproducible reprogramming process is reported here which enhances interactions of the cells with the viral vectors that leads to improved iPSC generation. The improved methods efficiently generates fully reprogrammed iPSC lines from 105–107 years old subjects in feeder-free conditions using an episomal, Sendai-Virus (SeV) reprogramming vector expressing four reprogramming factors. In conclusion, dermal fibroblasts from human subjects older than 100 years can be efficiently and reproducibly reprogrammed to fully pluripotent cells with minor modifications to the standard reprogramming procedures. Efficient generation of iPSCs from the elderly may provide a source of cells for the regeneration of tissues and organs with autologous cells as well as cellular models for the study of aging, longevity and age-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2942189006,"Electrospun filaments are leading to a new generation of medical yarns that have the ability to enhance tissue healing through their biophysical cues. We have recently developed a technology to fabricate continuous electrospun filaments by depositing the submicron fibres onto a thin wire. Here we investigate the influence of pyridine on the fibre deposition. We have added pyridine to polydioxanone solutions at concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 ppm, increasing the conductivity of the solutions almost linearly from 0.04 uS/cm to 7 uS/cm. Following electrospinning, this led to deposition length increasing from 1 cm to 14 cm. The samples containing pyridine easily underwent cold drawing. The strength of drawn filaments increased from 0.8 N to 1.5 N and this corresponded to a decrease in fibre diameter, with values dropping from 2.7 μm to 1 μm. Overall, these findings are useful to increase the reliability of the manufacturing process of continuous electrospun filaments and to vary their biophysical properties required for their application as medical yarns such as surgical sutures."
https://openalex.org/W2949443444,"YxaL is conserved within the Bacillus subtilis species complex associated with plants and soil. The mature YxaL protein contains a repeated beta-propeller domain, but the subcellular location and function of YxaL has not been determined. The gene encoding the mature YxaL protein was PCR amplified from genomic DNA of B. velezensis strain GH1-13 and used for recombinant protein production. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against the purified YxaL was generated and used for western blotting to determine the constitutive expression and secretion of YxaL. During normal culture growth of strain GH1-13, levels of the constitutively secreted YxaL were slowly rising to 100 μg L-1, and degraded with a half-life of 1.6 h in the culture medium. When the effects of YxaL on plant seed germination and seedling growth were examined, it was shown that seed treatment of Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa L.) with purified YxaL at the optimal concentration of 1 mg L-1 was effective at improving the root growth of plants. Seedlings from the treated Arabidopsis seeds markedly increased transcription of a 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthetase marker gene (ACS11) but reduced expression of auxin- and abscisic acid-responsive marker genes (IAA1, GH3.3, and ABF4), especially when provided with exogenous auxin. Horticulture experiments showed that pepper (Capsicum annuum) seeds treated with 1 mg L-1 YxaL in a soaking solution increased shoot growth and improved tolerance to drought stress. We hypothesize that YxaL secreted from plant growth-promoting Bacillus cells has a significant impact on plant roots, with the potential to improve plant growth and stress tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2952778683,"A key determinant of insect persistence in marginal habitats is the ability to tolerate environmental extremes such as temperature. Aedes aegypti is highly invasive and little is known about the physiological sensitivity of the species to fluctuating temperature regimes at the lower critical threshold for development. A temperature that may limit the establishment and persistence of the species in sub-optimal regions. Daily winter temperatures were measured in common Australian larval habitats, replicated in environmental chambers and used to investigate the effect of fluctuating temperatures on the development and survival of tropical and subtropical strains of Australian Ae. aegypti. Development was slow for all treatments but both strains were able to complete development to the adult stage, suggesting previous models underestimate the potential for the species to persist in eastern Australia. Results suggested that thermal buffering in large volume habitats, and water that persists for greater than 32 days, will facilitate completion of the life cycle during sub-tropical winters. Furthermore, we provide a non-linear estimate of the lower critical temperature for Ae. aegypti development that suggests the current threshold may be incorrect. Our study demonstrates that the current re-introduction of water storage containers such as rainwater tanks, into major Australian population centres will increase the risk of Ae. aegypti establishment by permitting year-round development in locations south of its current distribution."

https://openalex.org/W2942208054,"Repetitive mechanical load applied to a body part may lead to hypertrophy of its muscles. If a movement requires asymmetric activation of bilateral muscles, this may result in differences in muscle size between the sides. This study aimed to investigate the degree of bilateral differences in the trunk muscle volume of golfers by comparing with non-golfers. Seventeen male right-handed golfers and eleven (nine right- and two left-handed) non-golfers participated. Trunk muscle volume was determined using magnetic resonance imaging, and the degree of asymmetry was calculated as the ratio of trunk muscle volume on the left to trunk muscle volume on the right side in right-handers and vice-versa in left-handers. Golfers had significantly larger lateral abdominal wall (LA) muscle volume than non-golfers: 12.36 ± 1.12 vs. 9.96 ± 0.94 cm3/kg; erector spinae: 9.12 ± 1.16 vs. 7.88 ± 0.84 cm3/kg; psoas major (PM): 6.27 ± 0.88 vs. 5.51 ± 0.98 cm3/kg; rectus abdominis (RA): 4.15 ± 0.54 vs. 3.50 ± 0.64 cm3/kg; and multifidus: 3.61 ± 0.41 vs. 3.05 ± 0.40 cm3/kg (p < 0.05). The degree of bilateral asymmetry of the LA, PM, and RA volume was significantly greater in golfers than in non-golfers (LA: -8.63 ± 7.40% vs. 1.94 ± 2.76%; PM: -9.10 ± 5.25% vs. -0.48 ± 5.96%; RA: 6.36 ± 6.50% vs. -2.12 ± 9.64%, respectively, p < 0.05). Right-handed golfers had greater left LA and PM volume compared to the right (LA: 5.89 ± 0.55 vs. 6.48 ± 0.65 cm3/kg; PM: 3.00 ± 0.42 vs. 3.27 ± 0.47 cm3/kg; p < 0.05) and had greater right RA volume compared to the left (2.15 ± 0.32 vs. 2.00 ± 0.24 cm3/kg, p < 0.05). These findings suggest that skilled, long-term golfers develop large volume and bilateral asymmetry of their trunk muscles."
https://openalex.org/W2940465375,"Beet black scorch virus (BBSV) is a species in the Betanecrovirus genus, in family Tombusviridae. BBSV infection is of considerable importance, causing economic losses to sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) field crops worldwide. Phylogenetic analyses using 3′UTR sequences divided most BBSV isolates into two main groups. Group I is composed of Iranian isolates from all Iranian provinces that have been sampled. Chinese, European, one North American and some other Iranian isolates from North-Western Iran are in Group II. The division of Iranian BBSV isolates into two groups suggests numerous independent infection events have occurred in Iran, possibly from isolated sources from unknown host(s) linked through the viral vector Olpidium. The between-group diversity was higher than the within-group diversity, indicating the role of a founder effect in the diversification of BBSV isolates. The high FST among BBSV populations differentiates BBSV groups. We found no indication of frequent gene flow between populations in Mid-Eurasia, East-Asia and Europe countries. Recombination analysis indicated an intra-recombination event in the Chinese Xinjiang/m81 isolate and an inter-recombination breakpoint in the viral 3′UTR of Iranian isolates in subgroup IranA in Group I. The ω ratios (dNS/dS) were used for detecting positive selection at individual codon sites. Amino acid sequences were conserved with ω from 0.040 to 0.229 in various proteins. In addition, a small fraction of amino acids in proteins RT-ORF1 (p82), ORF4 (p7b) and ORF6 (p24) are positively selected with ω > 1. This analysis could increase the understanding of protein structure and function and Betanecrovirus epidemiology. The recombination analysis shows that genomic exchanges are associated with the emergence of new BBSV strains. Such recombinational exchange analysis may provide new information about the evolution of Betanecrovirus diversity."

However, the role of echocardiography for preoperative cardiac risk stratification prior to major noncardiac surgery is still controversial. Methods This retrospective study included a total of 1453 patients (51% male; age, 67 ± 16) who underwent intermediate- or high-risk major abdominal surgery or orthopedic surgery at two medical centers in South Taiwan between February 2013 and June 2016. All patients underwent preoperative transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). All of the included patients were followed up for 56 days after surgery. The primary endpoints were major adverse events (MAEs), i.e., all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular-cerebral events (MACCEs). Results A total of 35 patients (2.4%) reached the primary endpoint: 24 patients (1.6%) died, and 17 patients (1.2%) had MACCEs. Patients with postsurgery MAEs had higher average E/e’ values, a lower Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, and higher prevalence of significant mitral regurgitation (MR) and moderate-advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). Multivariate analysis showed that the modified Lee index and significant MR were independent prognostic predictors of MAEs. Conclusion Preoperative identification of significant MR on TTE is associated with increased MAEs at 56 days compared with that predicted by the modified Lee index alone in patients undergoing intermediate- or high-risk noncardiac surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2941228035,"The interaction of active faults as a factor affecting the mechanisms of large earthquakes has been observed in many places. Most aftershock and clustering earthquake sequences do not recur on the main seismogenic fault but are controlled by fault interactions with adjacent seismic structures. Four groups of conceptual models were generated in this study to determine how the geometry of the seismogenic faults controls the distributions of stress fields and earthquakes. The influences of the fault length ratio, center distance, overlap ratio, echelon distance and fault opening angle were considered in a 2D viscoelastic model. The results indicate that the interaction in the slipping zone is larger when collinear interacting faults are more closely positioned, with one fault lengthening. For noncollinear faults, the interaction is stronger as the inner tips pass each other, which impedes their growth after some degree of overlap. Additionally, fault interaction at the slipping zone becomes stronger as the opening angle approaches 180°. We further generated a 3D viscoelastic model of fault interactions in Central North China Block and applied the finite element method to analyze the relationship between distributions of earthquakes and fault geometry. The calculated results reveal well-matched higher stress and maximum shear strain concentrations in the southern part of the Fen-wei Graben Zone than in other zones in Central North China Block, which can be explained by the longer faults, shorter center distances, shorter overlap lengths and larger opening angles. The stress distributions and fault interactions should be considered in long-term seismic hazard assessment in these zones."

This study explored health system and patient factors associated with initiation and timeliness of treatment among DR-TB patients in Nigeria, ranked 4th globally for estimated TB cases in 2015. Methods A retrospective cohort study using 2015 diagnosis and treatment data from the Nigerian TB program electronic records examined “treatment ever received” (yes/no) and “treatment within 30 days” (yes/no). We compared health system and patient characteristics using binomial logistic regression, while controlling for confounders. Results Of 996 patients diagnosed nationwide in 2015 (aged 0–87 years, median 34), 47.8% were never treated. Of those treated (n = 520), 51.2% were treated within the 30 days prescribed in the National treatment guideline. Healthcare facility locations were significantly associated with ever receiving treatment and timely treatment. Predictors of timely treatment at the national level also included level of care and patient treatment history. The South-West zone, where DR-TB programs started, showed overall better access to DR-TB healthcare. Conclusions Healthcare facility geographic locations were significantly associated with treatment initiation and timeliness. Significant regional differences in access to DR-TB care in Nigeria persist, reflecting uneven contexts for national DR-TB treatment rollout."

Pain is a leading symptom in IBD and could be seen as an EIM itself. Treatment of IBD associated pain is challenging and insufficiently studied. A better knowledge on the association of pain and IBD specific treatment is warranted to improve the management of IBD patients.All patients of the Swiss IBD Cohort Study (SIBDCS) (n = 2152) received a questionnaire regarding pain localization, pain character, and the use of IBD specific medication.1263 completed questionnaires were received. Twenty-one out of 184 patients (10%) receiving anti-TNF treatment compared to 142 out of 678 patients (21%) not receiving anti-TNF medication reported elbow pain (p = 0.002) while 28 out of 198 patients (14%) receiving steroid treatment significantly more often reported elbow pain compared to 59 from 696 patients (8%) not receiving steroids (p = 0.021).

A total of 357 856 non-institutionalized youth at age of 15-24 years were investigated. Population weighted numbers and prevalence rates with 95% CI of various types and causes of disabilities for the overall youth were estimated where appropriate. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify the association between poverty and each type of and cause-specific disability.A weighted number of 3 633 838 youth were living with disability in China, with a prevalence rate of 19.7 per thousand Chinese youth. Youth living in poor households were 3.84 times more likely to be with disability than those living in affluent households (95% CI: 3.56-4.14). Associations were similar for most types of and cause-specific disabilities. Among youth with disability, those from poor households had less healthcare service use (OR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.61-0.82) than those from affluent households.A significant number of Chinese youth were living with disability, and poverty is significant associated with the disability among youth. Investment in health and disability prevention are essential to the development of youth, as well as their families and communities."
https://openalex.org/W2940542620,"The bacteriophage Mu Com is a small zinc finger protein that binds to its cognate mom mRNA and activates its translation. The Mom protein, in turn, elicits a chemical modification (momification) of the bacteriophage genome, rendering the DNA resistant to cleavage by bacterial restriction endonucleases, and thereby protecting it from defense mechanisms of the host. We examined the basis of specificity in Com–RNA interactions by in vitro selection and probing of RNA structure. We demonstrated that Com recognizes a sequence motif within a hairpin-loop structure of its target RNA. Our data support the model of Com interaction with mom mRNA, in which Com binds to the short hairpin structure proximal to the so-called translation inhibition structure. We also observed that Com binds its target motif weakly if it is within an RNA duplex. These results suggest that the RNA structure, in addition to its sequence, is crucial for Com to recognize its target and that RNA conformational changes may constitute another level of Mom regulation. We determined a crystal structure of a Com binding site variant designed to form an RNA duplex preferentially. Our crystal model forms a 19-mer self-complementary double helix composed of the canonical and non-canonical base pairs. The helical parameters of crystalized RNA indicate why Com may bind it more weakly than a monomeric hairpin form."

Previous studies have suggested that variations in the in vivo activities of DNases I-like 3(1L3) and II have an impact on autoimmune-related conditions. The genes for these DNases are known to show copy number variations (CNVs) whereby copy loss leads to a reduction of the in vivo activities of the enzymes, thereby possibly affecting the pathophysiological background of autoimmune diseases. Using a simple newly developed quantitative real-time PCR method, we investigated the distributions of the CNVs for DNASE1L3 and DNASE2 in Japanese and German populations. It was found that only 2 diploid copy numbers for all of these DNASE CNVs was distributed in both of the study populations; no copy loss or gain was evident for any of the autoimmune-related DNase genes. Therefore, it was demonstrated that these human autoimmune-related DNase genes show low genetic diversity of CNVs resulting in alterations of the in vivo levels of DNase activity."

Most often only a single childhood IQ test is available or is used for these purposes in the belief that IQ is stable across the life course. The primary aim of this study was to examine the longitudinal stability of individuals’ IQ test scores derived from school-age tests. The secondary aim was to investigate the association of the pre-adult scores with later life intelligence scores. The longitudinal pre-adult IQ scores of 42 high socioeconomic status Guatemalans born 1941–1953 were analysed and showed low stability of longitudinal test scores. Fluctuations of >1SD were found for 59.5% of the sample. The same participants, aged 64–76 years, were re-assessed and average pre-adult IQ explained 12% of variance in the older age intelligence score. The reasons behind the longitudinal instability in test scores reported in this study remains unknown but the results suggest single point measurements of intelligence before adulthood should be regarded with some caution."
https://openalex.org/W2941068419,"We propose novel estimators for the parameters of an exponential distribution and a normal distribution when the only known information is a sample of sample maxima; i.e., the known information consists of a sample of m values, each of which is the maximum of a sample of n independent random variables drawn from the underlying exponential or normal distribution. We analyze the accuracy and precision of the estimators using extreme value theory, as well as through simulations of the sampling distributions. For the exponential distribution, the estimator of the mean is unbiased and its variance decreases as either m or n increases. Likewise, for the normal distribution, we show that the estimator of the mean has negligible bias and the estimator of the variance is unbiased. While the variance of the estimators for the normal distribution decreases as m, the number of sample maxima, increases, the variance increases as n, the sample size over which the maximum is computed, increases. We apply our method to estimate the mean length of pollen tubes in the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana, where the known biological information fits our context of a sample of sample maxima."
https://openalex.org/W2940567773,"Introduction Submicroscopic Plasmodium infections are common in malaria endemic countries, but very little studies have been done in Senegal. This study investigates the genetic diversity and complexity of submicroscopic P. falciparum infections among febrile patients in low transmission areas in Senegal. Materials and methods Hundred and fifty blood samples were collected from febrile individuals living in Dielmo and Ndiop (Senegal) between August 2014 and January 2015, tested for microscopic and sub-microscopic P. falciparum infections and characterized for their genetic diversity and complexity of infections using msp-1 and msp-2 genotyping. Results Submicroscopic P. falciparum infections were 19.6% and 25% in Dielmo and Ndiop, respectively. K1 and 3D7 were the predominant msp-1 and msp-2 allelic types with respective frequencies of 67.36% and 67.10% in microscopic isolates and 58.24% and 78% in submicroscopic ones. Frequencies of msp-1 allelic types were statistically comparable between the studied groups (p>0.05), and were respectively 93.54% vs 87.5% for K1, 60% vs 54.83% for MAD20 and 41.93% vs 22.5% for RO33 while frequencies of msp-2 allelic types were significantly highest in the microscopy group for FC27 (41.93% vs 10%, Fisher’s Exact Test, p = 0.001) and 3D7 (61.29% vs 32.5%, Fisher’s Exact Test, p = 0.02). Multiplicities of infection were lowest in submicroscopic P. falciparum isolates. Conclusions The study revealed a high submicroscopic P. falciparum carriage among patients in the study areas, and that submicroscopic P. falciparum isolates had a lower genetic diversity and complexity of malaria infections."
https://openalex.org/W2940846886,"Language change is accelerated by language contact, especially by contact that occurs when a group of speakers shifts from one language to another. This has commonly been explained by linguistic innovation occurring during second language acquisition. This hypothesis is based on historical reconstructions of instances of contact and has not been formally tested on empirical data. In this paper, we construct an agent-based model to formalize the hypothesis that second language speakers are responsible for accelerated language change during language shift. We compare model predictions to a unique combination of diachronic linguistic and demographic data from Maputu, Mozambique. The model correctly predicts an increased proportional use of the novel linguistic variants during the period we study. We find that a modified version of the model is a better fit to one of our two datasets and discuss plausible reasons for this. As a general conclusion concerning typological differences between contact-induced and non-contact-induced language change, we suggest that multiple introductions of a new linguistic variant by different individuals may be the mechanism by which language contact accelerates language change."
https://openalex.org/W2941286369,"Massively parallel DNA sequencing of clinical samples holds great promise for the gene-based diagnosis of human inherited diseases because it allows rapid detection of putatively causative mutations at genome-wide level. Without additional evidence complementing their initial bioinformatics evaluation, however, the clinical relevance of such candidate genetic variants often remains unclear. In consequence, dedicated 'matching' services have been established in recent years that aim at the discovery of other, comparable case reports to facilitate individual diagnoses. However, legal concerns have been raised about the global sharing of genetic data, particularly in Europe where the recently enacted General Data Protection Regulation EU-2016/679 classifies genetic data as highly sensitive. Hence, unrestricted sharing of genetic data from clinical cases on platforms outside the national jurisdiction increasingly may be perceived as problematic. To allow collaborative data producers, particularly large consortia of diagnostic laboratories, to acknowledge these concerns while still practicing efficient case matching internally, novel tools are required. To this end, we developed VarWatch, an easy-to-deploy and highly scalable case matching software that provides users with comprehensive programmatic tools and a user-friendly interface to fulfil said purpose."
https://openalex.org/W2953257680,"Nitrogen composition of the grape must has an impact on yeast growth and fermentation kinetics as well as on the organoleptic properties of the final product. In some technological processes, such as white wine/rosé winemaking, the yeast-assimilable nitrogen content is sometimes insufficient to cover yeast requirements, which can lead to slow or sluggish fermentations. Growth is nevertheless quickly restored upon relief from nutrient starvation, e.g. through the addition of ammonium nitrogen, allowing fermentation completion. The aim of this study was to determine how nitrogen repletion affected the transcriptional response of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine yeast strain, in particular within the first hour after nitrogen addition. We found almost 4800 genes induced or repressed, sometimes within minutes after nutrient changes. Some of these responses to nitrogen depended on the TOR pathway, which controls positively ribosomal protein genes, amino acid and purine biosynthesis or amino acid permease genes and negatively stress-response genes, and genes related to the retrograde response (RTG) specific to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR). Some unexpected transcriptional responses concerned all the glycolytic genes, carbohydrate metabolism and TCA cycle-related genes that were down-regulated, as well as genes from the lipid metabolism."
