https://openalex.org/W2013326206,"The integrin α9β1 mediates cell adhesion to tenascin-C and VCAM-1 by binding to sequences distinct from the common integrin-recognition sequence, arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD). A thrombin-cleaved NH2-terminal fragment of osteopontin containing the RGD sequence has recently been shown to also be a ligand for α9β1. In this report, we used site-directed mutagenesis and synthetic peptides to identify the α9β1 recognition sequence in osteopontin. α9-transfected SW480, Chinese hamster ovary, and L-cells adhered to a recombinant NH2-terminal osteopontin fragment in which the RGD site was mutated to RAA (nOPN-RAA). Adhesion was completely inhibited by anti-α9 monoclonal antibody Y9A2, indicating the presence of a non-RGD α9β1recognition sequence within this fragment. Alanine substitution mutagenesis of 13 additional conserved negatively charged amino acid residues in this fragment had no effect on α9β1-mediated adhesion, but adhesion was dramatically inhibited by either alanine substitution or deletion of tyrosine 165. A synthetic peptide, SVVYGLR, corresponding to the sequence surrounding Tyr165, blocked α9β1-mediated adhesion to nOPN-RAA and exposed a ligand-binding-dependent epitope on the integrin β1 subunit on α9-transfected, but not on mock-transfected cells. These results demonstrate that the linear sequence SVVYGLR directly binds to α9β1 and is responsible for α9β1-mediated cell adhesion to the NH2-terminal fragment of osteopontin.

Chinese hamster ovary NH2-terminal osteopontin Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium polymerase chain reaction Integrins are cell surface heterodimeric receptors that mediate cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion (1Sheppard D.

Upon ligation by a wide variety of ligands, integrins can initiate signaling cascades that regulate cell growth, cell death, migration, polarization, and tissue remodeling (3Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). Integrins recognize a surprisingly large number of functionally diverse proteins as ligands, and the list of known integrin ligands continues to grow. New integrin ligands have been identified, and drugs targeting integrins have been developed as a consequence of the description of short linear amino acid sequences that directly bind to integrins. For example, the integrins α5β1, α8β1, αvβ1, αvβ3, αIIbβ3, αvβ5, αvβ6, and αvβ8 bind to sequences containing the tri-peptide sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD). Several new and biologically important integrin ligands have been identified based on the presence of this sequence (4Munger J.S. Huang X. Kawakatsu H. Griffiths M.J. Dalton S.L. Wu J. Pittet J.F.

Drugs modeled on the structure of the RGD sequence are being used or tested to inhibit integrin function for treatment of thrombosis, inflammation, atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, and cancer (5Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (2512) Google Scholar). The RGD sequence has also been exploited to target cell surface integrins to enhance gene delivery (6Hart S. Harbottle R.P. Cooper R. Miller A. Williamson R Coutelle C. Gene Ther. 1995; 2: 552-554PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously identified the recognition sequence for the integrin α9β1 in tenascin-C and found that this sequence did not include RGD, but was homologous to the α4β1 recognition sequence in the inducible endothelial adhesion molecule VCAM-1 (7Yokosaki Y.

This finding led to our identification of α9β1 as a receptor for VCAM-1 (8Taooka Y. Chen J. Yednock T. Sheppard D. J.

Osteopontin is present at high concentrations in diseases associated with tissue remodeling, including granuloma formation (12O'Regan A.W. Chupp G.L. Lowry J.A. Goetschkes M. Mulligan N. Berman J.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1024-1031PubMed Google Scholar) and coronary re-stenosis (13O'Brien E.R. Garvin M.R. Stewart D.K. Hinohara T. Simpson J.B. Schwartz S.M. Giachelli C.M. Arteriosc.

Osteopontin contains a predicted thrombin cleavage site (15Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Gracey C.F. Papadopoulos A. Tenen D.G. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5770-5774PubMed Google Scholar) and appears to be cleaved at this site in vivo (16Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Papadopoulous A.

Several integrins have been identified as osteopontin receptors. Of these, α5β1 (18Nasu K. Ishida T. Setoguchi M. Higuchi Y. Akizuki S. Yamamoto S. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), α8β1(19Denda S. Reichardt L.F. Muller U. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), αvβ1 (20Liaw L. Skinner M.P. Raines E.W. Ross R. Cheresh D.A. Schwartz S.M. Giachelli C.M. J. Clin.

However, two integrins that generally bind to non-RGD sequences, α4β1 (23Bayless K.J. Meininger G.A. Scholtz J.M. Davis G.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and α9β1 (24Smith L.L. Cheung H.K. Ling L.E. Chen J. Sheppard D. Pytela R. Giachelli C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28485-28491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), have also been reported to be osteopontin receptors. In contrast to the other integrin osteopontin receptors, α9β1 recognizes only the NH2-terminal fragment produced by thrombin cleavage, but does not appear to bind to full-length osteopontin, at least in vitro (24Smith L.L. Cheung H.K. Ling L.E. Chen J. Sheppard D. Pytela R. Giachelli C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28485-28491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In the present study we have used substitution and deletion mutagenesis and synthetic peptides to identify the sequence within this fragment that serves as the binding site for α9β1. The sequence identified (SVVYGLR) is a novel integrin-binding site that could serve as a basis for identifying additional α9β1 ligands or for developing specific inhibitors of α9β1function.DISCUSSIONPrevious reports identified osteopontin as a ligand for the integrin α9β1 and localized the binding site to a thrombin-cleaved NH2-terminal osteopontin fragment (24Smith L.L. Cheung H.K. Ling L.E. Chen J. Sheppard D. Pytela R. Giachelli C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28485-28491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have mapped the ligand-binding region within this osteopontin fragment in more detail by site-directed mutagenesis and synthetic peptides. The dramatic reduction of adhesion of α9-transfected cells to the mutant fragment in which tyrosine 165 in the C-terminal region of the fragment was replaced with alanine identified this tyrosine residue as critical for ligand binding. Two different deletion mutations in the C-terminal region also abolished α9β1-mediated adhesion. The effects of the peptide corresponding to the region surrounding Tyr165, SVVYGLR, inhibition of adhesion of α9-transfected cells to the NH2-terminal osteopontin fragment, and induction of a ligand binding-dependent epitope on the integrin β1subunit, provide further evidence that this region includes the ligand binding site.One previous report suggested that the RGD sequence itself played an important role in α9β1-mediated adhesion to the NH2-terminal fragment of osteopontin (30Smith L.L. Giachelli C.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In that report, a melanoma cell line that did not express any αvintegrins (Mo) and had previously been shown to attach to the NH2-terminal fragment, demonstrated markedly less adhesion to a fragment in which the RGD site was changed to RAA. In that study, deletion of the carboxyl-terminal region of the fragment, including both the RGD sequence and the adjacent SVVYGLR completely abolished adhesion of these cells, whereas the RAA mutation partially inhibited adhesion. These results are consistent with a role for the SVVYGLR peptide in α9β1-mediated adhesion. In the current study, we also found some inhibition of adhesion of α9-expressing cells by the RAA mutation, but this effect could have been entirely due to the effects of this mutation on other RGD-binding integrins expressed on the cells we used. Our results do not allow us to completely exclude any contribution of the RGD site to α9β1-mediated adhesion, but any such contribution, if present, appears to be minimal. We cannot fully explain the difference in the magnitude of inhibition by the RAA mutation in our study and the previous report. One possible explanation would be differential effects of the RAA mutation on the conformation of the SVVYGLR binding site under the conditions used to purify the recombinant fragments in the two studies. Another possibility is that the cell line used in the previous report expresses higher levels of other RGD-binding integrins or lower levels of α9β1 than the three transfected cell lines used in the current study.We have previously reported that α9β1 binds to two other ligands, tenascin-C (7Yokosaki Y. Matsuura N. Higashiyama S. Murakami I. Obara M. Yamakido M. Shigeto N. Chen J. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11423-11428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 25Yokosaki Y. Palmer E.L. Prieto A.L. Crossin K.L. Bourdon M.A. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26691-26696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and VCAM-1 (8Taooka Y. Chen J. Yednock T. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), at sites that do not include an RGD sequence. In those studies it was possible to definitively exclude any contribution of RGD sites. Since VCAM-1 does not contain an RGD, the attachment of α9-transfected CHO cells and SW480 cells to recombinant VCAM-1 (8Taooka Y. Chen J. Yednock T. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) is definitely RGD-independent. α9β1 mediates adhesion to the third fibronectin type III repeat in tenascin-C, a repeat that does contain an RGD site that serves as a ligand binding site for the integrins αvβ3 (31Prieto A.L. Edelman G.M. Crossin K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10154-10158Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), αvβ6 (31Prieto A.L. Edelman G.M. Crossin K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10154-10158Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 32Yokosaki Y. Monis H. Chen J. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24144-24150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and α8β1 (33Schnapp L.M. Hatch N. Ramos D. Kliminskaya I.V. Sheppard D. Pytela R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23196-23202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, the α9-transfected SW480 cells we used to study interaction with tenascin-C do not express any of these integrins. These cells adhered equally well to a wild type tenascin-C fragment as to a fragment in which the RGD sequence had been changed to RAA, and an RGD-containing peptide had no effect on adhesion.Most previously described integrin recognition motifs, including the EIDGIEL-recognition sequence we described in tenascin-C, include a central negatively charged amino acid residue. We were therefore surprised that mutation of each of the conserved negatively charged amino acids in the NH2-terminal fragment of osteopontin had little effect on α9β1-mediated adhesion to this fragment, and that the binding site we identified did not contain any negatively charged amino acids. Rather, the critical sequence includes a central tyrosine residue. Thus far, the only integrin fragments for which there are solved crystal structures are the inserted (or I) domains present in a subset of integrin α subunits. In the case of these integrins, the negatively charged aspartic acid residue present in many integrin ligands has been suggested as one of the coordination sites for a metal ion predicted to be required at the ligand binding site (34Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). However, the α9 subunit does not contain an I domain (35Palmer E.L. Ruegg C. Ferrando R. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and the structural basis of interactions of non-I domain-containing integrins with their ligands remains to be determined. The identification of an integrin ligand binding site without any acidic residues suggests that alternative mechanisms must exist for integrin-ligand interactions. However, it is possible that the free carboxyl terminus could be an alternative source of a negative charge. In any case, the recognition sequence we have described could also allow identification of additional α9β1 ligands and improved design of specific inhibitors.Based on the results of in vitro cell adhesion assays, the adhesive sequence in the NH2-terminal osteopontin fragment appears to be cryptic, and is not recognized by α9β1 in the full-length form of osteopontin (24Smith L.L. Cheung H.K. Ling L.E. Chen J. Sheppard D. Pytela R. Giachelli C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28485-28491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Osteopontin cleavage by thrombin thus appears to be critical for induction of accessibility to this site. Since the crystal structure of the osteopontin protein is not available at this time, we cannot predict the nature of any conformational change that results from thrombin cleavage. However, the localization of the recognition site to a linear peptide sequence immediately adjacent to the cleavage site fits well with the idea that this sequence is made accessible by thrombin cleavage.The biological significance of the thrombin-cleaved fragment that is present in vivo has not been previously determined (16Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Papadopoulous A. Anticancer Res. 1989; 9: 1291-1299PubMed Google Scholar, 17Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Papadopoulous S.A. Van de Water L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The results of this study together with the previous report provide insights into the potential physiological role of thrombin cleavage. We have previously shown that α9β1 is expressed on neutrophils (8Taooka Y. Chen J. Yednock T. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), smooth muscle cells, and epithelial cells (35Palmer E.L. Ruegg C. Ferrando R. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and that ligation of α9β1 can contribute to cell migration (8Taooka Y. Chen J. Yednock T. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and proliferation (32Yokosaki Y. Monis H. Chen J. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24144-24150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Upon thrombin cleavage of osteopontin at sites of inflammation or remodeling, the generation of an α9β1 ligand could thus enhance the cell migration and proliferation that are required for tissue remodeling to occur. In addition, osteopontin has another thrombin cleavage site at Arg160-Gly161 (16Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Papadopoulous A. Anticancer Res. 1989; 9: 1291-1299PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the fragment produced by cleavage at both sites would be GDSVVYGLR, a fragment that would be expected to inhibit α9β1-mediated effects on cell behavior, and thereby potentially contribute to the termination of the events described above. Integrins are cell surface heterodimeric receptors that mediate cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion (1Sheppard D. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 2Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar).

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and α9β1 (24Smith L.L. Cheung H.K. Ling L.E. Chen J. Sheppard D. Pytela R. Giachelli C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28485-28491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), have also been reported to be osteopontin receptors. In contrast to the other integrin osteopontin receptors, α9β1 recognizes only the NH2-terminal fragment produced by thrombin cleavage, but does not appear to bind to full-length osteopontin, at least in vitro (24Smith L.L.

In the present study we have used substitution and deletion mutagenesis and synthetic peptides to identify the sequence within this fragment that serves as the binding site for α9β1. The sequence identified (SVVYGLR) is a novel integrin-binding site that could serve as a basis for identifying additional α9β1 ligands or for developing specific inhibitors of α9β1function. DISCUSSIONPrevious reports identified osteopontin as a ligand for the integrin α9β1 and localized the binding site to a thrombin-cleaved NH2-terminal osteopontin fragment (24Smith L.L. Cheung H.K. Ling L.E. Chen J. Sheppard D. Pytela R. Giachelli C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28485-28491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have mapped the ligand-binding region within this osteopontin fragment in more detail by site-directed mutagenesis and synthetic peptides. The dramatic reduction of adhesion of α9-transfected cells to the mutant fragment in which tyrosine 165 in the C-terminal region of the fragment was replaced with alanine identified this tyrosine residue as critical for ligand binding. Two different deletion mutations in the C-terminal region also abolished α9β1-mediated adhesion. The effects of the peptide corresponding to the region surrounding Tyr165, SVVYGLR, inhibition of adhesion of α9-transfected cells to the NH2-terminal osteopontin fragment, and induction of a ligand binding-dependent epitope on the integrin β1subunit, provide further evidence that this region includes the ligand binding site.One previous report suggested that the RGD sequence itself played an important role in α9β1-mediated adhesion to the NH2-terminal fragment of osteopontin (30Smith L.L. Giachelli C.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In that report, a melanoma cell line that did not express any αvintegrins (Mo) and had previously been shown to attach to the NH2-terminal fragment, demonstrated markedly less adhesion to a fragment in which the RGD site was changed to RAA. In that study, deletion of the carboxyl-terminal region of the fragment, including both the RGD sequence and the adjacent SVVYGLR completely abolished adhesion of these cells, whereas the RAA mutation partially inhibited adhesion. These results are consistent with a role for the SVVYGLR peptide in α9β1-mediated adhesion. In the current study, we also found some inhibition of adhesion of α9-expressing cells by the RAA mutation, but this effect could have been entirely due to the effects of this mutation on other RGD-binding integrins expressed on the cells we used. Our results do not allow us to completely exclude any contribution of the RGD site to α9β1-mediated adhesion, but any such contribution, if present, appears to be minimal. We cannot fully explain the difference in the magnitude of inhibition by the RAA mutation in our study and the previous report. One possible explanation would be differential effects of the RAA mutation on the conformation of the SVVYGLR binding site under the conditions used to purify the recombinant fragments in the two studies. Another possibility is that the cell line used in the previous report expresses higher levels of other RGD-binding integrins or lower levels of α9β1 than the three transfected cell lines used in the current study.We have previously reported that α9β1 binds to two other ligands, tenascin-C (7Yokosaki Y.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), at sites that do not include an RGD sequence. In those studies it was possible to definitively exclude any contribution of RGD sites. Since VCAM-1 does not contain an RGD, the attachment of α9-transfected CHO cells and SW480 cells to recombinant VCAM-1 (8Taooka Y. Chen J. Yednock T. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) is definitely RGD-independent. α9β1 mediates adhesion to the third fibronectin type III repeat in tenascin-C, a repeat that does contain an RGD site that serves as a ligand binding site for the integrins αvβ3 (31Prieto A.L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23196-23202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, the α9-transfected SW480 cells we used to study interaction with tenascin-C do not express any of these integrins. These cells adhered equally well to a wild type tenascin-C fragment as to a fragment in which the RGD sequence had been changed to RAA, and an RGD-containing peptide had no effect on adhesion.Most previously described integrin recognition motifs, including the EIDGIEL-recognition sequence we described in tenascin-C, include a central negatively charged amino acid residue. We were therefore surprised that mutation of each of the conserved negatively charged amino acids in the NH2-terminal fragment of osteopontin had little effect on α9β1-mediated adhesion to this fragment, and that the binding site we identified did not contain any negatively charged amino acids. Rather, the critical sequence includes a central tyrosine residue. Thus far, the only integrin fragments for which there are solved crystal structures are the inserted (or I) domains present in a subset of integrin α subunits. In the case of these integrins, the negatively charged aspartic acid residue present in many integrin ligands has been suggested as one of the coordination sites for a metal ion predicted to be required at the ligand binding site (34Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). However, the α9 subunit does not contain an I domain (35Palmer E.L. Ruegg C. Ferrando R. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and the structural basis of interactions of non-I domain-containing integrins with their ligands remains to be determined. The identification of an integrin ligand binding site without any acidic residues suggests that alternative mechanisms must exist for integrin-ligand interactions. However, it is possible that the free carboxyl terminus could be an alternative source of a negative charge. In any case, the recognition sequence we have described could also allow identification of additional α9β1 ligands and improved design of specific inhibitors.Based on the results of in vitro cell adhesion assays, the adhesive sequence in the NH2-terminal osteopontin fragment appears to be cryptic, and is not recognized by α9β1 in the full-length form of osteopontin (24Smith L.L. Cheung H.K. Ling L.E. Chen J. Sheppard D. Pytela R. Giachelli C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28485-28491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Osteopontin cleavage by thrombin thus appears to be critical for induction of accessibility to this site. Since the crystal structure of the osteopontin protein is not available at this time, we cannot predict the nature of any conformational change that results from thrombin cleavage. However, the localization of the recognition site to a linear peptide sequence immediately adjacent to the cleavage site fits well with the idea that this sequence is made accessible by thrombin cleavage.The biological significance of the thrombin-cleaved fragment that is present in vivo has not been previously determined (16Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Papadopoulous A. Anticancer Res. 1989; 9: 1291-1299PubMed Google Scholar, 17Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Papadopoulous S.A. Van de Water L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The results of this study together with the previous report provide insights into the potential physiological role of thrombin cleavage. We have previously shown that α9β1 is expressed on neutrophils (8Taooka Y. Chen J. Yednock T. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), smooth muscle cells, and epithelial cells (35Palmer E.L. Ruegg C. Ferrando R. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and that ligation of α9β1 can contribute to cell migration (8Taooka Y. Chen J. Yednock T. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and proliferation (32Yokosaki Y. Monis H. Chen J. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24144-24150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Upon thrombin cleavage of osteopontin at sites of inflammation or remodeling, the generation of an α9β1 ligand could thus enhance the cell migration and proliferation that are required for tissue remodeling to occur. In addition, osteopontin has another thrombin cleavage site at Arg160-Gly161 (16Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Papadopoulous A. Anticancer Res. 1989; 9: 1291-1299PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the fragment produced by cleavage at both sites would be GDSVVYGLR, a fragment that would be expected to inhibit α9β1-mediated effects on cell behavior, and thereby potentially contribute to the termination of the events described above. Previous reports identified osteopontin as a ligand for the integrin α9β1 and localized the binding site to a thrombin-cleaved NH2-terminal osteopontin fragment (24Smith L.L. Cheung H.K. Ling L.E.

Most proteins destined for export are synthesized with N-terminal extensions, termed “signal peptides,” and the translocation event is catalyzed by the general secretory (Sec) apparatus (1Pugsley A.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Danese P.N. Silhavy T.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 59-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Signal peptides, which direct export via the Sec pathway, show little identity with each other at the amino acid level, although they share similar structures and physicochemical properties (3von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 184: 99-105Google Scholar). A subset of periplasmic, and periplasmically oriented, proteins are exported via a pathway which operates independently of the core Sec translocon in Escherichia coli (4Santini C-L. Ize B. Chanal A.

The bacterial twin arginine transfer peptide-dependent protein translocase (Tat system) is apparently both structurally and mechanistically related to the ΔpH-dependent protein import machinery identified in chloroplast thylakoid membranes (7Settles A.M.

Cell. 1998; 93: 93-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) isolated a point mutant resulting in a leucine for proline substitution at position 22. This tatB P22L mutant was unable to correctly localize the twin arginine transfer peptide-dependent trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)2 reductase, Me2SO reductase, or periplasmic nitrate reductase (9Weiner J.H. Bilous P.T. Shaw G.M. Lubitz S.P. Frost L. Thomas G.H. Cole J.A. Turner R.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 93-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). A strain in which tatB was disrupted by insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette has also been described (13Chanal A. Santini C-L. Wu L-F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As with thetatB P22L mutant, thetatB::kanR insertion mutant was found to be defective in the export of TMAO reductase. However, in marked contrast to a ΔtatAΔtatE mutant, thetatB::kanR mutant was reported to be unaffected in membrane targeting and translocation of the transfer peptide-dependent hydrogenase-2, suggesting that TatB is not required for the translocation of all transfer peptide-bearing proteins (13Chanal A. Santini C-L. Wu L-F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, while TatB is truncated at amino acid 88 in the tatB::kanR mutant, the mutant phenotype of the tatB P22L strain can be suppressed by a plasmid encoding only the initial 100 (from a possible 171) amino acid residues of TatB (9Weiner J.H. Bilous P.T. Shaw G.M. Lubitz S.P. Frost L. Thomas G.H. Cole J.A. Turner R.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 93-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that the N- and C-terminal regions of TatB comprise functionally distinct domains that are differentially affected in the two tatB mutant alleles. In the current work we have sought to define in more detail the roles of the three homologous TatA, TatB, and TatE proteins. An in-frame deletion mutant of tatB has been constructed allowing determination of the phenotype of an unambiguously null tatBallele, as well as direct phenotypic comparison with previously characterized in-frame deletion mutants in tatA,tatC, and tatE (10Bogsch E.G. Sargent F. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Robinson C. Palmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18003-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 12Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The effects of ΔtatB and tatB::kanRmutations on the localization of an extensive range of Tat-dependent substrates have been assessed. Our studies show that TatB is an essential component of the Tat pathway for all the substrates tested. No evidence for phenotypic variation between the twotatB alleles was detected. While we confirm a previous report that a portion of hydrogenase-2 activity is associated with the cytoplasmic membrane (13Chanal A. Santini C-L. Wu L-F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we go on to demonstrate that this protein is not translocated but remains on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. Taken together, our results argue against the idea that different Tat components interact with different sets of substrate preproteins. Complementation analysis is used to support the proposal that TatA and TatE are functionally equivalent to one another, but are functionally distinct from the TatB protein. Remarkably, E. coli TatA and TatE function can be substituted by TatA from Helicobacter pylori, suggesting that only weak amino acid sequence constraints are placed on these essential Tat components. Finally, in vivo pulse-chase experiments demonstrate that the TatB protein plays a key role in stabilizing TatC, providing initial evidence for possible complex formation between TatB and TatC.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Concentrations of antibiotics were as described previously (12Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Growth phenotypes of mutants were determined on M9 minimal medium (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For all biochemical characterizations, cells were cultured in the medium of Cohen and Rickenberg (CR) (18Cohen G.N. Rickenberg H.W. Ann. Inst. Pasteur (Paris). 1956; 91: 693-720PubMed Google Scholar) fortified as described by Sawers et al. (19Sawers R.G. Ballantine S.P. Boxer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 1324-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For anaerobic respiration, CR was supplemented with glycerol (0.5% w/v) or glucose (0.2% w/v) and TMAO, Me2SO, sodium nitrate, or sodium fumarate (all at 0.4% w/v) where indicated. For aerobic respiration and anaerobic fermentations, glucose was added to 0.4% (w/v). The tatB deletion strain BO/D was constructed as follows: a 618-base pair (bp) fragment covering downstream sequence and last eight tatB codons was amplified by PCR using primers TATB2 5′-GCGCATCGATCCTTCGTCGAGTGATAAACCGTAA-3′ and TATB3 5′-GCGCGGTACCTTGCGTAAGTCTTCTGGCGAG-3′ with MC4100 chromosomal DNA template. The product was digested with ClaI andKpnI and cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to give plasmid pFAT163. An 828-bp fragment (upstream sequence and start codon of tatB) was amplified using primers TATA1 (12Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) and TATB1 5′-GCGCGGATCCCACGGATTACACCTGCTCTTTATC-3′ with MC4100 DNA template. The product was digested with XbaI andBamHI cloned into pFAT163 to give pFAT164. ThetatB in-frame deletion allele was excised by digestion withXbaI and KpnI and cloned into the polylinker of pMAK705 (20Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant allele of tatB was transferred to the chromosome of MC4100 as described (20Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to give strain BO/D. The tatA,tatE double deletion strain JARV16 was constructed as follows. A 574-bp fragment covering downstream sequence and final six codons of tatA was amplified by PCR using primers TATA6 5′-GCGCATCGATGATAAAGAGCAGGTGTAA-3′ and TATA4 (12Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) with MC4100 DNA template. The product was digested with ClaI andKpnI and cloned into pFAT4 (12Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) to give plasmid pFAT16. DNA covering the in-frame deletion of tatA was excised by digestion with XbaI and KpnI and cloned into the polylinker of pMAK705. The mutant allele of tatA was transferred to the chromosome of J1M1 (MC4100, ΔtatE) (12Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) to give strain JARV16. Note that JARV16 was constructed as replacement for the original tatA,tatE double deletion strain, JARV15, described by Sargent et al. (12Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The strategy adopted for the construction of JARV15 may have inadvertently altered part of a putative tatB Shine-Dalgarno sequence located within the tatA gene (12Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). We therefore re-constructed the ΔtatA,ΔtatE strain maintaining all possible tatB Shine-Dalgarno sequences. With respect to Tat-dependent protein export, the JARV16 and JARV15 (12Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) strains have identical phenotypes (data not shown). The hydrogenase mutant strain FTD89 was constructed as follows. A 566-bp fragment covering upstream sequence and the first four codons ofhyaB (encoding the catalytic subunit of hydrogenase-1 (21Menon N.K. Robbins J. Peck Jr., H.D. Chatelus C.Y. Choi E.-S. Przybyla A.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1969-1977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) was amplified from MC4100 DNA by PCR using primers HYA1 5′-GCGCTCTAGACATTATCAAAGTACCTGGCTGCCC-3′ and HYA2 5′-GCGCGGATCCCTGAGTGCTCATGCCTGTTTATCC-3′ digested with XbaI and BamHI and cloned into pBluescript to give plasmid pFAT420. A 412-bp fragment covering the last five codons and DNA downstream of hyaB was amplified from MC4100 chromosomal DNA using the primers HYA3 5′-GCGCGGATCCGTGCAGGTGCGTTAACAGGAAGG-3′ and HYA4 5′-GCGCAAGCTTGCTGTGAATGTCCATTGAGTTGCC-3′, digested withBamHI and HindIII and cloned into pFAT420 to yield pFAT421. Following digestion with XbaI andKpnI, the DNA covering the in-frame deletion ofhyaB in pFAT421 was transferred to pMAK705 (resulting in plasmid pFAT422), the mutant allele was moved to the chromosome of MC4100 by homologous recombination as described (20Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to give strain FTD22 (as MC4100, ΔhyaB). A 534-bp fragment covering the upstream DNA sequence and the first three codons of hybC(encoding the catalytic subunit of hydrogenase-2 (22Menon N.K. Chatelus C.Y. Dervartanian M. Wendt J.C. Shanmugam K.T. Peck Jr., H.D. Przybyla A.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4416-4423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) was amplified from MC4100 DNA using primers HYB1 5′-GCGCTCTAGACGTTCATCATGGGCTTCTCGATTG-3′ and HYB2 5′-GCGCGGATCCCTGGCTCATGCTTTGCTCGCC-3′, digested withXbaI and BamHI and cloned into pBluescript to give plasmid pFAT430. A 566-bp DNA fragment covering the last eight codons of hybC and downstream sequence was amplified from MC4100 DNA using primers HYB3 5′-GCGCGGATCCGTGGTTTCAGTGAAGGTTCTGTAAT-3′ and HYB4 5′-GCGCAAGCTTCGCTGCCTGTACTTGCGCCTTCGG-3′, digested withBamHI and HindIII and cloned into pFAT430 to give pFAT431. The in-frame deletion of hybC in pFAT431 was excised by digestion with XbaI and KpnI, cloned into pMAK705 (resulting in plasmid pFAT432), and transferred to the chromosome of FTD22 as described (20Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resultant ΔhyaB,ΔhybC strain was named FTD89. All chromosomal in-frame deletion strains were carefully constructed so to preserve identifiable regulatory elements, coding sequences, stop codons, and Shine-Dalgarno sequences of genes flanking the deletions. Chromosomal deletion strains were confirmed by PCR, and chromosomal PCR products were sequenced to ensure that no point mutations had been introduced. BO/D-P (BO/D, pcnB1 zad-981::Tn10d (KanR)) and JARV16-P (JARV16, pcnB1 zad-981::Tn10d (KanR)) were constructed by P1 transduction (23Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) of thepcnB1 allele from VJS5833 (kindly provided by Professor V. Stewart). Both tat strains were difficult to transduce with P1. Therefore pFAT205, a temperature-sensitive plasmid carryingtatABCD (below), was introduced into the tatmutants prior to P1 transduction. Transduced strains were selected by virtue of acquired kanamycin resistance, which is linked to thepcnB allele. Kanamycin-resistant tat mutant strains were subsequently cured of pFAT205 by growth overnight at 44 °C. To confirm the linked pcnB allele had been co-transduced into the strains, the yield of plasmid DNA was quantified following transformation of the cured strains with pBluescript and subsequent plasmid purification. A list of plasmids featured under “Results and Discussion” is shown in Table I. Plasmid pFAT205 carries tatABCD in pMAK705. Initially, tatABCDwas excised from pFAT65 (12Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) by digestion with EcoRI and partial digestion with HindIII and cloned into pQE60 (Qiagen, Crawley, United Kingdom). The tat genes were then excised as a XhoI-PstI fragment and cloned intoSalI-PstI-digested pMAK705 to give pFAT205. Plasmid pFAT222, which carries thetat(ΔA)BCD operon with thetatA in-frame deletion allele in JARV16, was constructed as follows. A 76-bp fragment covering the start codon of tatAand upstream DNA was amplified using primers TATA5 and TATA2 (12Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) with pFAT65 template. The product was digested with EcoRI andBamHI and cloned into the polylinker of pT7.5 (16Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar) to give plasmid pFAT220. A 2236-bp fragment covering the deletion allele oftatA to the end of tatD was amplified using primers TATA5 and TATD1 with JARV16 DNA template. The product was digested with BamHI and XbaI and cloned into pFAT220 to give plasmid pFAT222. Plasmid pFAT217, which carries thetatA(ΔB)CD operon with thetatB in-frame deletion allele of BO/D, was constructed as follows. A 350-bp PCR fragment covering the start codon oftatB and upstream DNA was amplified using primers TATB1 and TATA5 (12Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) with pFAT65 template. The product was digested withEcoRI and BamHI and cloned into the polylinker of pT7.5 to give plasmid pFAT206. A 2017-bp PCR fragment covering the deletion allele of tatB plus tatC andtatD was amplified using primers TATA5 and TATD1 (12Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) with BO/D chromosomal DNA template. The product was digested withBamHI and XbaI and cloned into pFAT206 to give plasmid pFAT217. Plasmid pFAT228, which carries thetatAB(ΔC)D operon with the in-frame deletion allele of tatC present in B1LK0 (10Bogsch E.G. Sargent F. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Robinson C. Palmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18003-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), was constructed as follows. An 840-bp DNA fragment coveringtatA,tatB, and initial three codons oftatC was amplified by PCR using primers TATA5 (12Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) and TATC2 (10Bogsch E.G. Sargent F. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Robinson C. Palmer T. J. Biol.

The PCR product was digested withEcoRI and BamHI and cloned into pT7.5 to give plasmid pFAT227. A 1760-bp DNA fragment covering the entiretatAB(ΔC)D operon within the chromosome of B1LK0 was amplified by PCR using primers TATA5 and TATA6 (12Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) with B1LK0 chromosomal DNA template. The product was digested withBamHI and XbaI and the released 900-bp fragment cloned into pFAT227 to give plasmid pFAT228. Plasmid pFAT415 carries the tatA gene and more than 500 bp of upstream DNA in pBluescript. It was constructed after PCR amplification of the tatA region using primers TATA1 and TATA4 with MC4100 DNA template. Plasmid pFAT416 carries 500 bp of DNA sequence upstream of tatA (as in pFAT415) but also the ΔtatA allele and the intact tatB gene in pBluescript. pFAT416 was constructed by PCR using primers TATA1 and TATA4 and JARV16 DNA template. Plasmid pFAT45 has tatE as a 1450-bp insert in pBluescript and was cloned following amplification of the tatE region using primers TATE1 and TATE4 (12Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), with MC4100 chromosomal DNA template. Plasmid pNR42 carries the genes encoding the phage T7 polymerase and the temperature-sensitive λ repressor excised from pGP1-2 (16Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar) and cloned as a 4300-bpBamHI-PstI fragment into the polylinker of pSU18 (24Bartolomé B. Jubete Y. Martı́nez E. de la Cruz F. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 102: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). In the case of plasmids pFAT23Z (tatAB,ΔC::lacZ,D) and pFAT24Z (tatA,ΔB,ΔC::lacZ,D) the tatC gene was replaced from codon 3 to 255 by a complete in-frame lacZ coding sequence within the tatoperon and the (ΔtatB) operon as displayed by BO/D, respectively. The lacZ gene (minus stop codon) was amplified from pAA182 (25Jayaraman P.-S. Peakman T. Busby S. Quincey R. Cole J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 281-788Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar) using primers LACZ1A 5′-GCGCCTCGAGATGACCATGATTACGGATTCACTG-3′ and LACZ2A 5′-GCGCGGGCCCTTTTTGACACCAGACCAACTGGTA-3′, digested withApaI and XhoI and cloned into pBluescript to give plasmid pFAT1Z. DNA covering the final 4 codons of tatC and the tatD gene was amplified from pFAT65 with primers TATC3Z 5′-GCGCGGGCCCACTGAAGAATAAATTCAACCGCCCG-3′ and TATD1Z 5′-GCGCGGTACCCGATGGTGAGGCTCGCTCC-3′, digested withApaI and KpnI, and cloned into pFAT1Z to give pFAT1ZD (lacZ::tatC′tatD). DNA covering tatAB plus the initial 3 codons oftatC, and tatAΔB plus the same first 3 codons of tatC, was amplified using primers TATA1 (12Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) and TATC2Z 5′-GCGCCTCGAGTACAGACATGTTTACGGTTTATCAC-3′ with MC4100 and B℘D DNA template, respectively. PCR products were digested with XbaI and XhoI and cloned into pFAT1ZD to give plasmids pFAT23Z and pFAT24Z. Plasmids pFATHP1 and pFATHP2, which carry H. pylori 26695 (26Tomb J.-F. et al.Nature. 1997; 388: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (2991) Google Scholar) genes HP0320 and HP1060, respectively, were constructed as follows. A 1950-bp region covering HP0320 and a 600-bp region covering HP1060 were amplified by PCR utilizing H. pylori 26695 chromosomal DNA template. Primers for HP0320 amplification were HPTA1 5′-GCGCATCGATCGAAACCCTATAAAACCTATC-3′ and HPTA2 5′-GCGCGGATCCGCTTAATCTCTAGCGGAAATTTTGG-3′, the product was digested with ClaI and BamHI and cloned into pBluescript to give pFATHP1. Primers for HP1060amplification were HPTBC1, 5′-GCGCGGATCCGAAAGAAAATTACACTACAATAACG-3′, and HPTBC3, 5′-GCGCTCTAGACCTGTAAATGCGGTTTTAAATCTTC-3′, the product was digested with BamHI and XbaI and cloned into pBluescript to yield plasmid pFATHP2. All clones obtained from PCR amplified DNA were sequenced to ensure that no mutations had been introduced. Cells were harvested by sedimentation at 7000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and washed twice in ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). Periplasmic fractions were prepared by the lysozyme/EDTA method of Osborn et al. (27Osborn M.J. Gander J.E. Parisi E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3973-3986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 0.5 to 2-liter cultures, or by cold mild osmotic shock for smaller (typically 30 ml) cultures. The method of cold mild osmotic shock involved resuspension of the cell pellet from a 30-ml culture in 7.5 ml of 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mm EDTA. Following a 10-min incubation at 20 °C, cells were resedimented by centrifugation and the pellet taken up in 2 ml of ice-cold 5 mm MgSO4. After incubation in melting ice for 10 min, the resultant sphaeroplasts were harvested by centrifugation and the supernatant retained as periplasmic fraction. The periplasmic extract was buffered by addition of 100 μl of 1m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). Sphaeroplasts were lysed by passage through a French pressure cell and separated into membrane and cytosolic fractions as described (28Ballantine S.P. Boxer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 454-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Roc"
https://openalex.org/W2094840146,"The primary sequence of the murine fatty acid transport protein (FATP1) is very similar to the multigene family of very long chain (C20-C26) acyl-CoA synthetases. To determine if FATP1 is a long chain acyl coenzyme A synthetase, FATP1-Myc/His fusion protein was expressed in COS1 cells, and its enzymatic activity was analyzed. In addition, mutations were generated in two domains conserved in acyl-CoA synthetases: a 6- amino acid substitution into the putative active site (amino acids 249–254) generating mutant M1 and a 59-amino acid deletion into a conserved C-terminal domain (amino acids 464–523) generating mutant M2. Immunolocalization revealed that the FATP1-Myc/His forms were distributed between the COS1 cell plasma membrane and intracellular membranes. COS1 cells expressing wild type FATP1-Myc/His exhibited a 3-fold increase in the ratio of lignoceroyl-CoA synthetase activity (C24:0) to palmitoyl-CoA synthetase activity (C16:0), characteristic of very long chain acyl-CoA synthetases, whereas both mutant M1 and M2 were catalytically inactive. Detergent-solubilized FATP1-Myc/His was partially purified using nickel-based affinity chromatography and demonstrated a 10-fold increase in very long chain acyl-CoA specific activity (C24:0/C16:0). These results indicate that FATP1 is a very long chain acyl-CoA synthetase and suggest that a potential mechanism for facilitating mammalian fatty acid uptake is via esterification coupled influx."
https://openalex.org/W2094069152,"Activation of several inwardly rectifying K+ channels (Kir) requires the presence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2). The constitutively active Kir2.1 (IRK1) channels interact with PtdIns(4,5)P2 strongly, whereas the G-protein activated Kir3.1/3.4 channels (GIRK1/GIRK4), show only weak interactions with PtdIns(4,5)P2. We investigated whether these inwardly rectifying K+ channels displayed distinct specificities for different phosphoinositides. IRK1, but not GIRK1/GIRK4 channels, showed a marked specificity toward phosphates in the 4,5 head group positions. GIRK1/GIRK4 channels were activated with a similar efficacy by PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(3,5)P2, PtdIns(4,5)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. In contrast, IRK1 channels were not activated by PtdIns(3,4)P2 and only marginally by high concentrations of PtdIns(3,5)P2. Similarly, high concentrations of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 were required to activate IRK1 channels. For either channel, PtdIns(4)P was much less effective than PtdIns(4,5)P2, whereas PtdIns was inactive. In contrast to the dependence on the position of phosphates of the phospholipid head group, GIRK1/GIRK4, but not IRK1 channel activation, showed a remarkable dependence on the phospholipid acyl chains. GIRK1/GIRK4 channels were activated most effectively by the natural arachidonyl stearyl PtdIns(4,5)P2 and much less by the synthetic dipalmitoyl analog, whereas IRK1 channels were activated equally by dipalmitoyl and arachidonyl stearyl PtdIns(4,5)P2. Incorporation of PtdInsP2 into the membrane is necessary for activation, as the short chain water soluble diC4 PtdIns(4,5)P2 did not activate either channel, whereas activation by diC8 PtdIns(4, 5)P2 required high concentrations.

Most of the inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir)1 channels have been cloned and classified into subfamilies Kir 1–6 (1Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar,2Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 91-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The Kir 2.0 subfamily consists of constitutively active, strongly inwardly rectifying K+ channels. The first member to be cloned (3Kubo Y. Baldwin T.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 362: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar) was Kir 2.1 (IRK1), which is expressed in brain, heart muscle, and skeletal muscle (1Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The Kir 3.0 subfamily consists of the G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+ channels (GIRKs) (4Sui J.L. Chan K.W. Langan M.N. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 179-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 5Yamada M. Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 723-757PubMed Google Scholar). The prototype of this channel subfamily is the atrial acetylcholine-activated K+ channel, KACh, which mediates the effect of the vagus nerve on cardiac pacemaker cells. KACh is a heterotetramer comprising two subunits, GIRK1 and GIRK4 (6Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that the mechanism of activation is via direct interaction of the channel with G protein βγ subunits (7Logothetis D.E. Kurachi Y. Galper J. Neer E.J. Clapham D.E.

Physiol. 1996; 108: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and Mg2+ ions (11Petit Jacques J. Sui J. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), although a quantitatively minor membrane component, is a key signaling phospholipid. Its hydrolysis by phospholipase C and further phosphorylation by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases generates important second messengers. In addition to serving as a precursor for second messengers, PtdIns(4,5)P2 itself plays an important role in such processes as the organization of the cytoskeleton and vesicular transport (12Toker A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 13Hsuan J.J. Minogue S. dos Santos M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 167-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, PtdIns(4,5)P2 has been shown to directly regulate various ion channels and transporters, such as the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (14Hilgemann D.W. Ball R. Science. 1996; 273: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), the InsP3receptor Ca2+ channel (15Lupu V.D. Kaznacheyeva E. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Bezprozvanny I. J. Biol.

IRK1 channels are constitutively active, with their activity depending only on the presence of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the membrane (19Zhang H. He C. Yan X. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). ROMK1 channels are regulated by protein kinase A through phosphorylation. The role of phosphorylation may be to enhance the interaction of these channels with PtdIns(4,5)P2 (18Liou H.-H. Zhou S.-S. Huang C.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5820-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). GIRK1/GIRK4 channels are regulated by Gβγ and intracellular Na+ ions. It has been proposed that both regulatory molecules exert their effects by strengthening the interaction of the channel with PtdIns(4,5)P2 (17Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 19Zhang H. He C. Yan X. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. Nat.

Zhang H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 630Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It seems, from these data, that PtdIns(4,5)P2 may serve as a common final regulator of several inwardly rectifying K+ channels. Furthermore, dynamic changes in PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the membrane can also contribute to the regulation of ion channels. Upon activation of phospholipase C by receptor stimulation in vivo, PtdIns(4,5)P2 concentration in the membrane decreases (26Willars G.B. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5037-5046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 27Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), and this decrease leads to inhibition of GIRK1/GIRK4 channels (29Kobrinsky E. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. Biophys. J. 1999; 76 (abstr.): A411Google Scholar). PtdIns(4,5)P2 may therefore also serve as a control point for cross-talk between different signaling pathways. In the present study, we have investigated the structural elements in PtdIns(4,5)P2 responsible for the interaction with inwardly rectifying K+ channels. For this purpose, we examined the effects of different phosphoinositides on recombinant channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We have chosen GIRK1/GIRK4 and IRK1 because they show different affinities toward PtdIns(4,5)P2; GIRK1/GIRK4 interacts with PtdIns(4,5)P2 weakly, whereas the interaction of IRK1 with PtdIns(4,5)P2 is strong (17Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 19Zhang H. He C. Yan X. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). We found that, in addition to the different affinities for PtdIns(4,5)P2, the two channels show remarkable differences in specificity toward various phosphoinositides. Some of these results have appeared in a preliminary form as an abstract (30Rohacs T. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Logothetis D.E. Biophys. J. 1999; 76 (abstr.): A410Google Scholar). Dipalmitoyl (diP) PtdIns(4,5)P2, PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(3,5)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3were synthesized as described previously (31Prestwich G.D. Acc. Chem. Res. 1996; 29: 503-513Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 32Peng J. Prestwich G.D. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998; 39: 3965-3968Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar), some batches of diP PtdIns(4,5)P2 were purchased from Echelon Research Laboratories Inc. (Salt Lake City, UT), Matreya Inc. (Pleasant Gap, PA), and Calbiochem. Short chain PtdIns(4,5)P2-s (diC4 and diC8) were purchased from Echelon. PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(4)P, purified from bovine brain, containing mostly the arachidonyl and stearyl (AASt) acyl chains, were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and from Calbiochem. PtdIns (purified from bovine liver) was purchased from Sigma. All synthetic analogs (from Echelon or synthesized in the laboratory of G. D. P.) were analyzed by 1H and 31P NMR and found to be homogenous in isomer composition to a detection limit of 2.5% and free from particulate material. The phosphate composition of these samples was established to be 75–95% of the theoretical amount by colorimetric analysis of ashed samples. Commercial PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 AAst lipids show phosphate content in the 80–95% range using the same methodology. All of the long acyl chain lipids (except PtdIns) were dispersed in water (0.5 mm) by sonication for 30 min on ice and then aliquoted and kept at −80 °C. Before experiments, a new aliquot was thawed, which was used only on that day. The lipid was diluted in the bath solution (see below under “Electrophysiology”) and sonicated for 10–30 min. This procedure results in the formation of mostly small micelles of PtdInsP2 (33Flanagan L.A. Cunningham C.C. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Kosik K.S. Janmey P.A. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1440-1447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Application of these lipids to the patch activates the channels, probably by fusion of these micelles to the patch membrane. The short acyl chain, water-soluble lipids (diC4 and diC8) were dissolved in water, aliquoted, and kept at −80 °C. We also sonicated these analogs in a similar manner to the longer acyl chain forms. PtdIns was dissolved in chloroform and kept at −80 °C. Before experiments, an aliquot was taken, chloroform was evaporated under N2, and PtdIns was then dispersed in bath solution by sonicating for 30 min. GIRK1, GIRK4 and IRK1 were subcloned in the pGMHE plasmid vector. The constructs were linearized with NheI, and cRNAs were transcribed in vitro using the “message machine” kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Xenopus oocytes were surgically removed, dissociated by collagenase treatment, and microinjected with 50 nl of water solution of the desired cRNA, as described previously (34Chan K.W. Langan M.N. Sui J.L. Kozak J.A. Pabon A. Ladias J.A. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Four ng of cRNA were injected for each of GIRK1 and GIRK4 and 0.5–1 ng for IRK1. Experiments were performed 1–4 days after injection. Single-channel recordings on GIRK1/GIRK4 channels were performed in the inside-out patch configuration using an EPC-7 patch clamp amplifier. All microelectrodes were pulled from WPI-K borosilicate glass using a Sutter P-97 microelectrode puller and gave 2–6 megaohms of resistance. The vitelline membrane of theXenopus oocytes was removed before seal formation using fine forceps. The pipette solution contained 96 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaCl, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.35). The bath solution contained 96 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.35). Gadolinium at 100 μmconcentration was added to the pipette solution to inhibit stretch-activated channels in the oocyte membrane. Free Mg2+ concentration was calculated as described previously (35Vivaudou M. Arnoult C. Villaz M. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 122: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Single-channel recordings were performed at −80 mV holding potential. Single-channel currents were filtered at 1 kHz and collected at 5–10 kHz for GIRK1/GIRK4 and 0.5–1 kHz for IRK1 channels. Data were stored directly on the hard drive of the computer through the Digidata 1200 interface (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). pCLAMP 6.01 (Axon Instruments) software was used for data acquisition and analysis. For calculation of NP o,NF o, and MT o in patches with a few unitary events, we complemented pCLAMP with our analysis program as described previously (10Sui J.L. Chan K.W. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (see also Axon Instruments' Web page). Results are displayed as average NP o over 5-s bins. For macropatch recordings (36Hilgemann D.W. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single - channel Recording. Plenum Press, New York1995: 307-327Google Scholar), low resistance pipettes (15–25-μm tip diameter) were used. Sampling rate was usually 30 Hz. Pipette and bath solutions were the same as in the single-channel measurements, including gadolinium in the pipette solution. The omission of gadolinium in macropatch measurements did not significantly affect the data. Recordings were performed at −80 mV holding potential. For quantitative analysis, the currents elicited by the phosphoinositides were fit by a sigmoidal (Boltzmann) function using the curve-fitting routine of Microcal Origin. Some of these fits are shown on Figs. 5,B and C, and 6 B. All experiments were performed at room temperature (20–22 °C).FIG. 6Effect of the number of phosphates in the head group on the efficacy of phosphoinositides on the activation of IRK1 channels. Representative macropatch measurements are shown with: A, 2.5 μm PtdIns(4)P; B, 25 μm PtdIns(4)P; and C, 25 μmPtdIns. At the end of each experiment, 2.5 μmPtdIns(4,5)P2 was applied as a positive control. Thearrows show the establishment of the inside-out patch configuration. Asterisks indicate brief successive steps to 0 and +80 mV.

Statistical significance was calculated with t test or analysis of variance. We examined first the effects of different PtdInsP2 analogs on GIRK1/GIRK4 channels expressed inXenopus oocytes. These channels are not significantly activated by 2.5 μm PtdIns(4,5)P2alone (20Sui J.L. Petit Jacques J. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar); however, the presence of PtdIns(4,5)P2 is required for other gating molecules such as Gβγ, Na+, and Mg2+ to activate the channel (11Petit Jacques J. Sui J. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19Zhang H. He C. Yan X. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). To test the interaction of the channel with PtdInsP2, we chose Na+ and Mg2+ rather than Gβγ to gate the channel because the effect of the ions is faster than that of Gβγ and is easily reversible. The top panel of Fig. 1 A shows the open probability (NP o) of channels in a typical experiment. Themiddle and bottom panels of Fig. 1 Ashow the mean open time (MT o) and mean frequency of opening (NF o) analysis, respectively, of the same experiment. Fig. 1 B shows representative current traces from the same patch that is shown in Fig. 1 A. After excision of the patch, channel activity ran down quickly, yielding very low levels of activity (trace a). This current rundown is thought to be attributable to the basal breakdown of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the membrane by lipid phosphatases and phospholipases, as well as the removal of cytosolic factors (Na+, Mg2+, GTP) needed for activity of the channel. The average NP o after channel rundown in the absence of Mg2+ and Na+ was 0.0106 ± 0.002 (n = 40). Application of 2 mm free Mg2+, 5 mmATP, and 20 mm Na+ induced high channel activity (trace b), because in the presence of ATP, lipid kinases can resynthesize PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the membrane, which together with Na+ and Mg2+ activate the channel. After removal of ATP, channel activity ran down despite the continued presence of the two gating ions. The averageNP o after channel rundown, in the presence of Mg2+ and Na+, was 0.0915 ± 0.0170 (n = 40). Application of PtdIns(4,5)P2alone thereafter did not significantly activate the channels. Reintroduction of Na+ and Mg2+ ions following patch exposure to 2.5 μm PtdIns(4,5)P2induced channel activity comparable with that induced by ATP, Mg2+, and Na+. PtdIns(4,5)P2 and Mg2+ ATP also increased the mean open time of the channels (Fig. 1 A, middle panel), consistent with our previous report (20Sui J.L. Petit Jacques J. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This increase, however, was small and contributed only slightly to the increase in NP o . ATP and 2.5 μmAASt PtdIns(4,5)P2 increased MTo from 2.11 ± 0.08 to 4.49 ± 0.22 ms (n = 27, p < 0.005) and from 1.87 ± 0.11 to 4.39 ± 0.31 ms (n = 13, p < 0.005), respectively. In experiments similar to the one shown in Fig. 1 A, we examined the effect of reducing the number of phosphate groups in the head group of PtdIns(4,5)P2 on channel activity. Fig. 1 C summarizes the data comparing PtdIns(4,5)P2, PtdIns (4Sui J.L. Chan K.W. Langan M.N. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 179-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar)P, and PtdIns. PtdIns at 2.5 μm was inactive (Fig. 1 C) and remained ineffective even at 25 μm (n = 2, data not shown). We next studied how the acyl chain composition influences the efficiency of these lipids to activate GIRK1/GIRK4 channel currents. Phosphoinositides in mammalian cells usually contain the arachidonyl side chain in position 2 and the stearyl side chain in position 3 (AASt) of the glycerol backbone (Fig. 2 D). In studying phospholipid signaling, synthetic analogs of these lipids are frequently used, which usually contain palmitoyl chains in both positions (diP), as the arachidonyl forms are difficult to handle during synthesis. Much to our surprise, we found a marked difference in efficacy between the synthetic versus the natural forms. The natural AASt PtdIns(4,5)P2 at 2.5 μm was about four times more active than the synthetic diP PtdIns(4,5)P2, even when the latter was applied at 25 μm (Fig. 2 B). DiP PtdIns(4,5)P2 also increased MT o less effectively than the AASt form. MT o was increased from 1.98 ± 0.18 to 3.16 ± 0.47 ms (n = 7,p < 0.02) by 2.5 diP PtdIns(4,5)P2 and from 1.74 ± 0.13 to 3.02 ± 0.44 ms (n = 4,p < 0.05) by 25 μm diP PtdIns(4,5)P2. The difference between diP and AASt PtdIns(4,5)P2 was even more marked when the experiments were performed on macropatches. Macropatch recordings of GIRK1/GIRK4 channels were relatively difficult to obtain because of the moderate expression of these channels. Thus, most experiments involving GIRK1/GIRK4 channels were performed on smaller patches. Fig. 2 C shows a representative macropatch measurement. After establishing the inside-out configuration, channels were allowed to run down, judging by application of Na+ and Mg2+ inducing only small currents. When the patch was treated with 2.5 μm diP PtdIns(4,5)P2, the Mg2+/Na+-induced current became gradually higher; it was 4.90 ± 2.07 times higher 10 min after the application of the lipid than before (n = 4,p < 0.05). Subsequent application of 2.5 μm AASt PtdIns(4,5)P2 substantially increased the Mg2+/Na+-induced current. Treatment with AASt PtdIns(4,5)P2 for 10 min rendered the Mg2+/Na+-induced current 100.9 ± 31.8 times higher than before the application of the lipids (n = 9, p < 0.01). Similar to our results with PtdIns(4,5)P2, the higher efficacy of AASt compared with diP PtdIns (3Kubo Y. Baldwin T.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also tested the effects of two different short chain analogs, diC8 and diC4 PtdIns(4,5)P2, on small patches in the presence of Mg2+ and Na+. DiC8 PtdIns(4,5)P2 activated GIRK1/GIRK4 channels when applied at 25 μm concentration (Fig. 2 A, lower panel and 2 B, right panel). This activation was immediate and quickly reversible, in contrast to the effects of the longer chain forms. DiC8PtdIns(4,5)P2 at 2.5 μm was marginally active (Fig. 2 B). The shortest side chain, diC4PtdIns(4,5)P2, was inefficient at both 2.5 and 25 μm (data not shown). We next tested the effect of the position of the phosphate group in the inositol ring on channel activation (Fig. 3.). We examined phosphoinositides containing phosphates in the following positions: 4,5; 3,5; 3,4; and 3,4,5. These head group combinations cover all of the naturally occurring PtdInsP2 and PtdInsP3. These experiments were carried out with the synthetic diP acyl chain forms of these lipids, as the purified (AASt) forms are not available. Representative experiments are shown in Fig. 3 A, and the data are summarized in Fig. 3 B. Even though the 4,5 and 3,4,5 analogs appeared to be slightly more active, all of these forms were able to activate the channel. These analogs also increasedMT o to a similar extent as diP PtdIns(4,5)P2 (data not shown). We also examined the effect of diP PtdIns(3,5)P2 in macropatches, using a protocol similar to that shown on Fig. 2 C. Following a 10-min treatment with 2.5 μm PtdIns(3,5)P2, the Mg2+/Na+-induced current was 3.67 ± 1.29 times higher than before lipid treatment (n = 4,p < 0.05). This response was similar to that induced by diP PtdIns(4,5)P2 (see Fig. 2 C). Thus, in both small patches and macropatches, activation of GIRK currents by phosphoinositides did not show a dependence on the position of the phosphate group in the inositol ring. Because of the high levels of expression of IRK1, macroscopic currents could easily be obtained from inside-out macropatches. IRK1 channels interact with PtdIns(4,5)P2strongly, and as a result, the lipid alone activates the channels without the need for accessory molecules (19Zhang H. He C. Yan X. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Because macropatch recordings of IRK1 offer the advantage of allowing assessment of the macroscopic kinetics of channel activation by the lipids tested, they were used for most experiments. First, we examined the effect of the acyl chain using the same analogs as for GIRK1/GIRK4. Fig. 4, Aand B, show that diP and AASt PtdIns(4,5)P2activated the channels with very similar kinetics and to similar extents. The summary of the data is shown in Fig. 4 D. Fig. 4 C shows the effect of the short chain analog diC8 PtdIns(4,5)P2. IRK1 was activated partially by 2.5 μm diC8PtdIns(4,5)P2, whereas 25 μm diC8was required for activation similar to that elicited by the longer side chain forms at 2.5 μm. The kinetics of activation were markedly faster than those of the diP or AASt forms (Fig. 4 D). Also, the effect rapidly reversed upon wash-out of this lipid (Fig. 4 C), unlike with the diP and AASt analogs. The shortest acyl chain form, diC4 PtdIns(4,5)P2, was completely ineffective at 25 μm concentration (not shown). We next examined whether IRK1 shows stereospecificity toward the position of phosphates on the inositol head group. Fig. 5, A–E, shows representative measurements, and Fig. 5 F shows the summary of the data. PtdIns(3,4)P2 did not activate the channels at concentrations of 2.5 (not shown) and 25 μm (Fig. 5 E). PtdIns(3,5)P2 was inactive at 2.5 μm (Fig. 5 A) and was partially active at 25 μm (Fig. 5 B). PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was partially active at 2.5 μm (Fig. 5 C) and almost fully active at 25 μm (Fig. 5 D). As a positive control, we applied PtdIns(4,5)P2 at the end of each experiment. The summary data are expressed as a percentage of the PtdIns(4,5)P2-induced response (Fig. 5 F). We also examined the effect of the number of phosphates in the head group on IRK1 activation, by applying PtdIns (4Sui J.L. Chan K.W. Langan M.N. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Adv.

We demonstrate for the first time that the levels of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and the hydroxyl radical ((.)OH) are significantly higher, and the level of the superoxide anion (O(2)(.-)) is significantly lower in ALS mutant mice than in controls, supporting by in vivo evidence the hypothesis that the mutant enzyme catalyzes (.)OH formation by the sequence: O(2)(.-) --> H(2)O(2) --> (.)OH. This removes doubts regarding the relevance of elevated ROS in FALS raised by in vitro experiments. The levels of oxidation products are also significantly higher in the mutant mice than in controls, consistent with some previous reports. Only the superoxide concentration differs between two controls among all the measurements. Our findings correlate in vivo a gene mutation to both elevated H(2)O(2) and (.)OH and increased oxidation of cellular constituents. The elevated H(2)O(2) in mutant mice indicates impairment of its detoxification pathways, perhaps by changed interactions between SOD1 and H(2)O(2) detoxification enzymes.-Liu, D., Wen, J., Liu, J., Li, L.

Measurement of glucose transport and glycogen synthesis in L6 myotubes showed that insulin stimulated both processes, by 2- and 5-fold, respectively. Acute (30 min) exposure of muscle cells to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) blocked the hormonal activation of both these processes. Immunoblot analyses of cell lysates prepared after an acute oxidant challenge using phospho-specific antibodies against c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, protein kinase B (PKB), and p42 and p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases established that H2O2 induced a dose-dependent activation of all five protein kinases. In vitro kinase analyses revealed that 1 mm H2O2stimulated the activity of JNK by ∼8-fold, MAPKAP-K2 (the downstream target of p38 MAP kinase) by ∼12-fold and that of PKB by up to 34-fold. PKB activation was associated with a concomitant inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3. Stimulation of the p38 pathway, but not that of JNK, was blocked by SB 202190 or SB203580, while that of p42/p44 MAP kinases and PKB was inhibited by PD 98059 and wortmannin respectively. However, of the kinases assayed, only p38 MAP kinase was activated at H2O2 concentrations (50 μm) that caused an inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport and glycogen synthesis. Strikingly, inhibiting the activation of p38 MAP kinase using either SB 202190 or SB 203580 prevented the loss in insulin-stimulated glucose transport, but not that of glycogen synthesis, by oxidative stress. Our data indicate that activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway plays a central role in the oxidant-induced inhibition of insulin-regulated glucose transport, and unveils an important biochemical link between the classical stress-activated and insulin signaling pathways in skeletal muscle.

Stimulation of the p38 pathway, but not that of JNK, was blocked by SB 202190 or SB203580, while that of p42/p44 MAP kinases and PKB was inhibited by PD 98059 and wortmannin respectively. However, of the kinases assayed, only p38 MAP kinase was activated at H2O2 concentrations (50 μm) that caused an inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport and glycogen synthesis. Strikingly, inhibiting the activation of p38 MAP kinase using either SB 202190 or SB 203580 prevented the loss in insulin-stimulated glucose transport, but not that of glycogen synthesis, by oxidative stress. Our data indicate that activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway plays a central role in the oxidant-induced inhibition of insulin-regulated glucose transport, and unveils an important biochemical link between the classical stress-activated and insulin signaling pathways in skeletal muscle. A key aspect of mammalian physiology involves the regulation of blood glucose levels. Glucose homeostasis is controlled largely by the action of circulating insulin, which facilitates the disposal of blood glucose in the fed state by stimulating its uptake into target tissues, primarily skeletal muscle and fat (1Kahn B.B. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1644-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 2Holman G.D. Cushman S.W. BioEssays. 1994; 11: 753-759Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 3Galuska D. Ryder J. Kawano Y. Charron M.J. Zierath J.R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 441: 73-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Both these tissues contribute toward the lowering of blood glucose, but it is widely accepted that skeletal muscle, by virtue of its large contribution to body mass, represents the major site of insulin-mediated glucose disposal (4DeFronzo R.A. Bonadonna R.C. Ferrannini E. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 318-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). The stimulation in glucose uptake elicited by insulin in both skeletal muscle and fat is achieved principally by the increased recruitment of the insulin regulated glucose transporter, GLUT4, to the blood-facing membranes of these tissues from its intracellular storage pools (5Holman G.D. Kasuga M. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).Reduced insulin sensitivity is a characteristic feature of various pathological conditions such as diabetes (1Kahn B.B. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1644-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 6DeFronzo R.A. Ferrannini E. Diabetes Care. 1991; 14: 173-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (4135) Google Scholar) and hypertension (7Ferrari P. Weidmann P. J. Hypertens. 1990; 8: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and fat may result in the progressive dysfunction of important hormonal effects such as glucose and protein homeostasis, and thus it is of considerable interest to understand the molecular pathology of this process. One factor that appears to be important in the progression of insulin resistance in the above conditions, as well as during hypoxia, ischemia/reperfusion injury, and sepsis, is increased oxidant stress (8Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar, 9Parik T. Allikmets K. Teesalu R. Zilmer M. J. Cardiovasc.

Care. 1995; 10: 122-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Prolonged oxidant stress in muscle and fat has been shown to reduce insulin-stimulated glucose transport significantly and to induce a compensatory increase in basal transport, through increased synthesis of GLUT1 (13Kozlovsky N.

Bashan N. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 35: E935-E940Google Scholar). The mechanism by which oxidant stress causes insulin resistance, be it a nonspecific effect of chronic exposure to reactive oxygen species or the specific activation of a stress-related signaling pathway, is unknown. However, since various stresses are known to induce a cellular protective response that involves activation of various protein kinases (15Cohen P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), it is possible that this participates in modulating insulin action.Insulin is known to stimulate multiple signaling pathways, but there is general acceptance that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) plays a central role in regulating glucose transport and glycogen synthesis (5Holman G.D. Kasuga M. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar,16Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). The hormonal activation of PI3K catalyzes the production of 3′-phosphoinositides (e.g. phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate), which act as key intermediates in the activation of protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), a molecule that is regulated also by growth factors and which plays a crucial role in the control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (17Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 18Kolesnick R.N. Kronke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Activated PKB is known to target glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), whose phosphorylation results in its inactivation, a step that is considered crucial for the concomitant activation of glycogen synthase (19Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Cross D.A.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 20Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar). In addition, there is growing evidence that expressing constitutively active or dominant negative PKB mutants in muscle and fat cells induce changes in glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation that are consistent with the involvement of PKB in the insulin signaling pathway regulating glucose uptake (21Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 22Tanti J.F. Grillo S. Gremeaux T. Coffer P.J.

Biol. 1999; 19: 4008-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Impaired activation of these early signaling molecules represents a potential mechanism by which insulin sensitivity may be lost in response to increased oxidant stress. This possibility is supported by recent work showing that oxidant stress inhibits the hormonal activation of IRS1, PI3K, and PKB in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 adipocytes (25Hansen L.L. Ikeda Y.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10595-10602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, it is noteworthy that reactive oxygen species such as H2O2 also exert insulin-like effects and can activate PKB (27Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 28Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Yin Q. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22699-22704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) and numerous other protein kinases, including components of the classical MAP kinase and stress signaling pathways (11Clerk A. Fuller S.J. Michael A. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7228-7234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 27Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem.

Toyokuni S. Uchida K. Odaka H. Tanaka T. Ikeda H. Hiai H. Seino Y. Yamada Y. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). It is likely that the activation of these pathways plays an important role in mediating some of the biological and possibly pathological responses to environmental stresses. Indeed, in some cell types, activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway has been implicated with some of the adverse complications associated with raised blood glucose levels and diabetes (31Igarashi M. Wakasaki H. Takahara N. Ishii H. Jiang Z.Y. Yamauchi T. Kuboki K. Meier M. Rhodes C.J. King G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Whether stress kinases, such as JNK and p38 MAP kinase, participate in modulating insulin action in response to oxidative stress in skeletal muscle is unknown currently. In this study we show that acute oxidative stress activates both JNK and the p38 MAP kinase pathway in cultured rat muscle cells and that activation of the latter results in the inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport.DISCUSSIONThe present study has shown that subjecting muscle cells to acute oxidative stress (using H2O2) results in a dramatic loss in insulin-stimulated glucose transport and glycogen synthesis. Interestingly, the loss in insulin sensitivity can be reversed rapidly, suggesting that H2O2 is likely to modulate insulin action by altering the activity of signaling molecules that mediate the biological effects of the hormone. This notion is supported by recent work showing that fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 adipocytes subjected to oxidative stress show a marked decline in insulin sensitivity that stems from a disruption in the activation of IRS1, PI3K, and PKB (25Hansen L.L. Ikeda Y. Olsen G.S. Busch A.K. Mosthaf L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25078-25084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 26Tirosh A. Potashnik R. Bashan N. Rudich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10595-10602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, our findings indicate that such a mechanism is unlikely to explain the inhibition in insulin-stimulated glucose transport and glycogen synthesis in L6 myotubes as both processes were inhibited by H2O2 concentrations (50 μm) that had no apparent effect on PKB activation by insulin (Fig. 5 b). This latter finding implies that the upstream insulin signaling events are fully functional. Furthermore, at higher (1 mm) concentrations, H2O2acts as an insulin mimetic, in that it activates both PKB α and γ and inhibits GSK3, a finding that is in line with similar observations reported using HEK 293 cells (27Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). However, despite the changes in PKB and GSK3 activity that take place in the presence of 1 mmH2O2, insulin fails to elicit any stimulation in glucose uptake or glycogen synthesis, signifying that the loss in insulin action in L6 cells is likely to occur by a mechanism different to that reported in fat cells (26Tirosh A. Potashnik R. Bashan N. Rudich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10595-10602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar).In addition to its insulin-like effects on PKB and GSK3, H2O2 also activated two separate stress signaling pathways, JNK and p38 MAP kinase. Activation of p38 has been suggested to be important in mediating some of the harmful effects associated with hyperglycaemia in smooth muscle cells (31Igarashi M. Wakasaki H. Takahara N. Ishii H. Jiang Z.Y. Yamauchi T. Kuboki K. Meier M. Rhodes C.J. King G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), and we believe that this pathway may also participate in the regulation of insulin-stimulated glucose transport in L6 myotubes during acute oxidative stress. This tenet is based on three separate lines of evidence. First, the loss in insulin-stimulated glucose transport was elicited at a H2O2 concentration (50 μm) that also induced activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway. At this H2O2 concentration, none of the other kinases assayed showed any detectable changes in phosphorylation and/or activity. Second, we were able to restore insulin-stimulated glucose transport within 30 min of removing H2O2 from the extracellular bathing solution. The ability to recover the insulin response correlated with the rapid dephosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase observed during the post-wash period. Finally, inhibiting the H2O2-induced activation of p38 MAP kinase, using SB 202190 and SB 203580, prevented the loss in insulin-stimulated glucose transport caused by H2O2. In contrast, SB 202190 and SB 203580 failed to inhibit JNK activation, consistent with previous reports showing that, at micromolar concentrations, both compounds target p38 MAP kinase selectively (for review see Ref. 15Cohen P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Moreover, our finding that both SB 202190 and SB 203580 prevent the H2O2-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase is fully consistent with reports showing that these compounds inhibit the agonist-induced phosphorylation and activity of p38 (38Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 39Frantz B. Klatt T. Pang M. Parsons J. Rolando A. Williams H. Tocci M.J. O'Keefe S.J. O'Neill E.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13846-13853Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Collectively, the above findings support the view that the oxidant-induced activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway plays a role in preventing the hormonal stimulation in glucose transport in skeletal muscle cells.The concept that there may be some element of “cross-talk” between the p38 MAP kinase pathway and the insulin signaling pathway is not without precedent. Evidence exists in the literature showing that insulin can, depending on cell type, stimulate or inhibit the activity of p38 MAP kinase (40Moxham C.M. Tabrizchi A. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30765-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 41Heidenreich K.A. Kummer J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9891-9894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and more recently it was reported that incubation of both 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes with SB 203580 inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transport in these two cell lines (42Sweeney G. Somwar R. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10071-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In the latter study the inhibitor was purported to induce a reduction in the functional activity of glucose transporters in the plasma membrane rather than blocking their acquisition from intracellular stores in response to insulin. However, we have been unable to observe any inhibition in the insulin-stimulated influx of glucose following pre-incubation of muscle cells with either SB 202190 (Fig. 6 b) or SB 203580 (data not shown). The precise reason for this discrepancy remains unclear, but it may result plausibly from differences in experimental design and the duration of cell pre-treatments.Previous work has reported that JNK activation in response to anisomycin (an environmental stress agent) can stimulate glycogen synthase in a manner similar to insulin in skeletal muscle (40Moxham C.M. Tabrizchi A. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30765-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The stimulation in glycogen synthase elicited by anisomycin was attributed to an activation of PP-1 (the phosphatase that dephosphorylates and stimulates glycogen synthase; Ref. 43Dent P. Lavoinne A. Nakielny S. Caudwell F.B. Watt P. Cohen P. Nature. 1990; 348: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and a parallel inactivation of GSK3. In our study, however, although incubation of muscle cells with 1 mm H2O2 caused JNK activation and an inhibition of GSK3, we did not detect any stimulation in glycogen synthase activity or glycogen synthesis. Moreover, in the presence of H2O2, insulin fails to stimulate glycogen synthase. One possible explanation for this is that H2O2, unlike anisomycin, either inhibits or fails to activate PP-1. If so, then increased oxidant levels may also interfere with the hormonal regulation of the phosphatase pathway, by an unknown mechanism. It is highly unlikely that the p38 MAP kinase pathway participates in the regulation of glycogen synthase or PP-1 given that, unlike their effects on glucose transport, neither SB 202190 nor SB 203580 suppressed the H2O2-induced loss in insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis.With one exception (44Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Lee A.D. Hansen P.A. Holloszy J.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), work from a number of laboratories, including our own, has suggested that PKB is likely to be an integral component of the insulin signaling pathway regulating glucose transport (21Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 22Tanti J.F. Grillo S. Gremeaux T. Coffer P.J.

Biol. 1999; 19: 4008-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). If this is correct, then agents that activate PKB should enhance glucose uptake in a manner similar to insulin. However, no increase in glucose transport was observed (Fig. 1 a) under circumstances when both PKBα and PKBγ were activated 34- and 12-fold, respectively (Fig. 3, a and b) by H2O2. We speculated that one explanation for this observation was that, like insulin, the effects of H2O2 might be inhibited downstream of PKB by a mechanism that involved the parallel activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway. Indeed, when activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway was inhibited using SB 202190, H2O2 stimulated glucose transport to a level comparable to that seen in muscle cells treated with insulin. Importantly, the increase in glucose transport elicited by H2O2 was sensitive to wortmannin, consistent with the observation that H2O2activates PKB in L6 myotubes in a PI3K-dependent fashion. These findings therefore support the view that PKB is a key component of the insulin-signaling pathway regulating glucose transport.Taken together, our findings indicate the existence of an important biochemical link between the p38 MAP kinase pathway and the insulin-signaling cascade that regulates glucose transport in skeletal muscle cells. Activation of the former in response to oxidative stress modulates the hormonal regulation of glucose transport at a point downstream of PKB. Such a mechanism may be significant physiologically and might help explain the reduced insulin sensitivity that is often observed after bouts of strenuous muscle exercise (45Kirwan J.P. Hickner R.C.

Precisely how activation of the p38 pathway modulates insulin-stimulated glucose transport remains poorly understood, but possible downstream effectors include: MAPKAP-K2/K3 (50Rouse J. Cohen P.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar), and themitogen- and stress-activatedkinase (MSK1) (54Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). However, we believe that MSK1 is unlikely to be involved, based on preliminary data showing that the protein kinase C inhibitor Ro 318220, which also inhibits strongly the stress-mediated activation of MSK1 but not that of MAPKAP-K2 (54Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar), fails to halt the H2O2-induced loss in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (data not shown). No inhibitors exist currently that inactivate MAPKAP-K2/K3, MNK1/2, or PRAK specifically, but assessing their potential role as modulators of insulin action during oxidant stress remain important issues for future study. A key aspect of mammalian physiology involves the regulation of blood glucose levels. Glucose homeostasis is controlled largely by the action of circulating insulin, which facilitates the disposal of blood glucose in the fed state by stimulating its uptake into target tissues, primarily skeletal muscle and fat (1Kahn B.B. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1644-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 2Holman G.D. Cushman S.W. BioEssays. 1994; 11: 753-759Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 3Galuska D. Ryder J. Kawano Y.

Both these tissues contribute toward the lowering of blood glucose, but it is widely accepted that skeletal muscle, by virtue of its large contribution to body mass, represents the major site of insulin-mediated glucose disposal (4DeFronzo R.A. Bonadonna R.C. Ferrannini E. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 318-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). The stimulation in glucose uptake elicited by insulin in both skeletal muscle and fat is achieved principally by the increased recruitment of the insulin regulated glucose transporter, GLUT4, to the blood-facing membranes of these tissues from its intracellular storage pools (5Holman G.D. Kasuga M. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Reduced insulin sensitivity is a characteristic feature of various pathological conditions such as diabetes (1Kahn B.B.

Insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and fat may result in the progressive dysfunction of important hormonal effects such as glucose and protein homeostasis, and thus it is of considerable interest to understand the molecular pathology of this process. One factor that appears to be important in the progression of insulin resistance in the above conditions, as well as during hypoxia, ischemia/reperfusion injury, and sepsis, is increased oxidant stress (8Baynes J.W.

Prolonged oxidant stress in muscle and fat has been shown to reduce insulin-stimulated glucose transport significantly and to induce a compensatory increase in basal transport, through increased synthesis of GLUT1 (13Kozlovsky N.

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), it is possible that this participates in modulating insulin action. Insulin is known to stimulate multiple signaling pathways, but there is general acceptance that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) plays a central role in regulating glucose transport and glycogen synthesis (5Holman G.D. Kasuga M. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar,16Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). The hormonal activation of PI3K catalyzes the production of 3′-phosphoinositides (e.g. phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate), which act as key intermediates in the activation of protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), a molecule that is regulated also by"

Metabolically [3H]glucosamine-labeled HS was isolated from chlorate-treated and untreated Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and subjected to low pH nitrous acid cleavage. Saccharides representing (i) the N-sulfated domains, (ii) the domains of alternatingN-acetylated and N-sulfated disaccharide units, and (iii) the N-acetylated domains were recovered and subjected to compositional disaccharide analysis. Upon treatment with 50 mm chlorate, overall O-sulfation of HS was inhibited by ∼70%, whereas N-sulfation remained essentially unchanged. Low chlorate concentrations (5 or 20 mm) selectively reduced the 6-O-sulfation of HS, whereas treatment with 50 mm chlorate reduced both 2-O- and 6-O-sulfation. Analysis of saccharides representing the different domain types indicated that 6-O-sulfation was preferentially inhibited in the alternating domains. These data suggest that reduced 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate availability has distinct effects on the N- and O-sulfation of HS and thatO-sulfation is affected in a domain-specific fashion.

The proteins bind primarily to sulfated domains that are assembled during HS biosynthesis in the Golgi apparatus (2Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U.

HS chain formation is initiated by addition of alternating d-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) andN-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) residues to the priming sugar sequence GlcNAc-GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl, that is linked to serine residues in HS proteoglycan core proteins. The subsequent modification of the nascent (GlcUA-GlcNAc) n polymer, particularly the pattern of sulfation, determines the binding specificity of a given HS species to various proteins (2Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 4Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The first modification step, N-deacetylation/N-sulfation of GlcNAc residues, occurs in a regioselective fashion and results in the domain design characteristic of HS. The three domain types are (i) sequences of consecutive N-sulfated disaccharide units (NS domains), (ii) sequences of alternating N-acetylated andN-sulfated disaccharide units (NA/NS domains) and (iii) repeats of N-acetylated disaccharide units (NA domains) (2Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar,4Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The further modification reactions all occur in the vicinity of previously incorporated N-sulfate groups. GlcUA residues are in part converted to l-iduronic acid (IdoA) residues by C5 epimerization, and some of the IdoA units undergo 2-O-sulfation. Although IdoA formation occurs in both NS and NA/NS domains, 2-O-sulfation appears to be largely restricted to the former domain type (5Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). By contrast, the other majorO-sulfate substituent, at C6 of GlcN residues, is found both in NS and NA/NS domains, as well as in the portions of NA domains that are vicinal to N-sulfate groups of neighboring domains. Consequently, more than 50% of all 6-O-sulfate groups in a HS polymer may be found outside the NS domains (5Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Rarely,O-sulfation occurs also at C2 of GlcUA units and at C3 of GlcNSO3 units (2Salmivirta M.

In HS biosynthesis, the product of a given modification reaction generally serves as a substrate for the next reaction. Although this substrate specificity constrains the number of possible structures occurring in HS, the type and extent of sulfation vary between HS species from various cell (6Kato M. Wang H.

Diabetes. 1983; 32: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and amyloidosis (13Lindahl B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26091-26094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), particularly with regard to 6-O-sulfation of the GlcN residues. At least in some cases, such modulation seems to involve a particular HS domain type. For example, we have found an age-dependent increase in GlcN 6-O-sulfation preferentially of the NS domains in human aorta HS (11Feyzi E. Saldeen T. Larsson E. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13395-13398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). On the other hand, studies with malignantly transformed cells suggest an association between transformation and altered 6-O-sulfation of NA/NS domains (14Winterbourne D.J. Mora P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4310-4320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Jayson G.C. Lyon M. Paraskeva C. Turnbull J.E. Deakin J.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 51-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the HS 6-O-sulfotransferases are known to present in at least three genetically distinct isoforms (4Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the modulation might involve controlled action of distinct 6-O-sulfotransferase species. To better understand the control of HS sulfation, we have studied the effects of chlorate treatment on the production of HS by MDCK cells. Chlorate competitively inhibits the formation of 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) (16Farley J.R. Nakayama G. Cryns D. Segel I.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 185: 376-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the high energy sulfate donor in cellular sulfation reactions. The sulfation pathway involves transport of sulfate to the cytosol, its reaction with ATP to form adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate, and phosphorylation of adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate to form PAPS (17Girard J.-P. Baekkevold E.S. Amalric F. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Hirchsberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). PAPS in then transported into the Golgi apparatus and used in sulfate transfer to acceptor structures. Culture of cells in chlorate-supplemented medium has been widely used in experimental work addressing HS functions (19Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar, 20Delehedde M. Deudon E. Boilly B. Hondermarck H. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Kispert A. Vainio S. Shen L. Rowitch D.H. McMahon A.P. Development. 1996; 122: 2637-3627Google Scholar), but the effects of chlorate treatment on the various HS sulfation reactions have not been studied in detail. It has, however, been shown that chlorate treatment of fibroblasts predominantly reduced the formation ofO-sulfate rather than N-sulfate groups (22Greve H. Cully Z. Blumberg P. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12886-12892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that chlorate may affect distinct sulfation reactions to different extents. We here show, by detailed assessment of HS structure in chlorate-treated and control MDCK cells, that chlorate differentially down-regulates the various HS sulfation reactions, in the overall order of 6-O-sulfation > 2-O-sulfation >N-sulfation. We further demonstrate that chlorate treatment has selective effects on the 6-O-sulfation of different HS domains, such that the 6-O-sulfation of NS domains is affected to a lesser extent than the 6-O-sulfation of NA/NS and NA domains. MDCK cells (strain II) were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Bio-Whittaker, Verviers, Belgium) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (23Kolset S.O. Vuong T.T. Prydz K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1797-1801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments, cells were seeded on polycarbonate filters (4.7 cm2; pore size, 0.4 μm; Type 3412; Costar, Cambridge, MA) kept in glass dishes containing 90 ml of culture medium. The cultures reached confluence after 3–4 days, after which the filters were transferred to six-well culture dishes, each well containing 2 ml of medium (basolateral medium). One ml of medium was added to the cell monolayer on the filter in its holder (apical medium). Metabolic labeling in the absence or presence of chlorate (0–50 mm) was carried out in glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 μCi/ml [3H]GlcN (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After 24 h, the apical and basolateral media were collected, and loose cells were pelleted by centrifugation. The media supernatants were brought to 4m guanidine-HCl, 2% Triton X-100 in 0.1 msodium acetate, pH 6.0. The basolateral media fractions, which have been shown to contain >75% of secreted HS proteoglycans in cultures of polarized MDCK cells (23Kolset S.O. Vuong T.T. Prydz K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1797-1801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were subjected to isolation and characterization of HS as described below. Labeled macromolecules in the culture media were separated from free radioactivity by chromatography on a 4-ml column of Sephadex G-50 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.05m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.15 m NaCl. Proteoglycans were purified by chromatography on a column of DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0.15–1.5 m) in 0.05 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0. Proteoglycan fractions were pooled, dialyzed against water, and lyophilized. DEAE-purified proteoglycans (each sample representing material from six 4.7-cm2 filters) were treated with 1 unit of chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4; Seikagaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) in 0.04 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.04m sodium acetate containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 4 h at 37 °C. HS chains were thereafter liberated from their protein cores by alkaline β-elimination (treatment with 0.5n NaOH at 4 °C overnight) followed by neutralization of the samples by careful addition of 4 m acetic acid. Previous control experiments involving biosynthetically35S-labeled heparin-like polysaccharide showed no loss of sulfate groups to occur under these conditions (cf. Ref.24Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12857-12864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2U. Lindahl, unpublished data. HS chains were recovered by DEAE chromatography as follows: samples were diluted 5-fold with water and passed through a 2-ml column of DEAE-Sephacel equilibrated with 0.2 m NH4HCO3. Columns were washed in a stepwise manner with 0.2 mNH4HCO3, 0.25 m NaCl and again with 0.2 m NH4HCO3, followed by elution of bound HS chains with 2 mNH4HCO3. The eluates were freeze-dried and stored at −20 °C until further analysis. To assess the purity of the HS preparations, aliquots of [3H]HS were treated with HNO2 at pH 1.5 (see below). The HNO2-treated and untreated samples were chromatographed on a column of Superose 12 (1 × 30 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 1 m NaCl, 0.05 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and analyzed for radioactivity by scintillation counting. The charge density of HS was studied by anion exchange chromatography. Samples of [3H]HS were applied to a 2-ml column of DEAE-Sephacel equilibrated with 0.05 m LiCl, 0.05m sodium acetate, pH 4.0. Bound HS was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.05–1.5 m LiCl in 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and analyzed for radioactivity. To study the hydrodynamic size of HS, samples of [3H]HS were applied to a column of Superose 6 (1 × 30 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), calibrated with hyaluronan and heparin fragments of defined size as described previously (25Petersen F. Brandt E. Lindahl U. Spillmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12376-12382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The column was run in 1m NaCl, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and analyzed for radioactivity. The occurrence of N-unsubstituted GlcN units was studied by treating samples of [3H]HS with HNO2 at pH 3.9 (see below), followed by chromatography on Superose 6. Samples of [3H]HS were treated with HNO2, pH 1.5, reagent in a volume of 0.5 ml for 10 min at room temperature (26Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), after which the pH was raised to ∼9 by addition of 2 mNa2CO3. This treatment causes deaminative cleavage of the polysaccharides at GlcNSO3 units, which are concomitantly converted into anhydromannose residues. These were further reduced to 2,5-anhydromannitol (aManR) units with NaBH4 (5 mg/ml). After 3 h, the excess NaBH4 was destroyed by acidifying the samples (to pH ∼4) by addition of 4 m acetic acid followed by neutralization with 4 m NaOH. For analysis of the depolymerization pattern, the cleavage products were chromatographed on a column of Bio-Gel P-10 (1 × 150 cm; Bio-Rad) in 1 m NaCl, 0.05m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.01% Triton X-100 at a flow rate of 2.3 ml/h. Fractions of 1.2 ml were collected and analyzed for radioactivity. The N-sulfation degree of the GlcN residues was calculated as described previously (14Winterbourne D.J. Mora P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4310-4320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For preparation of saccharide material representing the NS, NA/NS, and NA domains, the products of the HNO2, pH 1.5, cleavage were applied to a column of Sephadex G-15 (1 × 190 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fractions containing disaccharides (corresponding to NS domains) were pooled, desalted by lyophilization, and subjected to compositional disaccharide analysis (see below). To purify the tetra- and ≥-hexasaccharide fractions (which represent NA/NS and NA domains, respectively), the cleavage products were chromatographed on a column of Superdex 30 (1.6 × 60 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) calibrated with standard heparin oligosaccharides and run in 0.5 mNH4HCO3. The tetrasaccharide and ≥-hexasaccharide fractions were pooled, desalted by lyophilization, and N-deacetylated in hydrazine hydrate containing 30% water (Fluka), 1% (w/v) hydrazine sulfate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in tightly sealed glass tubes at 100 °C for 4 h (27Guo Y. Conrad H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Hydrazine hydrate was removed by repeated evaporation and intermittent addition of water followed by desalting of the samples on a Sephadex G15 column in 0.2 m NH4HCO3.N-Deacetylated saccharides were then treated with HNO2 at pH 3.9 (26Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) for 10 min at room temperature, after which the solution was neutralized by addition of Na2CO3 and reduced with NaBH4 as described for the HNO2, pH 1.5, procedure. This treatment causes cleavage at GlcNH3+ units generated by the N-deacetylation process. The resultant disaccharides were desalted by chromatography on a column of Sephadex G-15 in 0.2m NH4HCO3, lyophilized, and subjected to anion exchange HPLC. The [3H]disaccharides derived from NS, NA/NS, or NA domains (see above) were separated by anion exchange HPLC on a column of Partisil-10 SAX (4.6 × 250 mm; Whatman Inc., Clifton, NJ). The column was eluted using a step gradient of KH2PO4 (28Bienkowski M.J. Conrad H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 356-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed for radioactivity. Disaccharide peaks were identified by comparing their elution positions with those of heparin-derived standard disaccharides (29Pejler G. Bäckström G. Lindahl U. Paulsson M. Dziadek M. Fujiwara S. Timpl R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5036-5043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent MDCK cell cultures were metabolically radiolabeled with [3H]GlcN in the presence or absence of sodium chlorate. Proteoglycans were recovered from the conditioned media by DEAE chromatography, followed by isolation of [3H]HS as described under “Materials and Methods.” The purified [3H]HS preparations were quantitatively degraded into lower molecular weight species by treatment with HNO2 at pH 1.5, as shown by gel chromatography on Superose 12 (data not shown), and thus did not contain any contaminating 3H-labeled macromolecules. To monitor the effect of chlorate on HS sulfation, samples of [3H]HS from control and chlorate-treated cells were chromatographed on an anion exchange column of DEAE-Sephacel. The HS samples were quantitatively retained by the column, but they required different concentrations of LiCl for their elution. The peak elution positions of HS from control cells and from cells treated with 5 mm chlorate corresponded to ∼0.85 m LiCl, whereas HS synthesized in the presence of 20 or 50 mmchlorate emerged at lower LiCl concentrations (0.73 and 0.53m, respectively; Fig. 1). These data suggest that chlorate inhibits HS sulfation in a dose-dependent fashion in MDCK cells. Previous studies with microsomal fraction from mastocytoma tumors suggest that sulfation of the growing heparin polymer promotes its further elongation (30Lidholt K. Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 999-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). On the other hand, chlorate treatment has been reported to increase HS chain length in cultured adipocytes (31Hoogewerf A.J. Cisar L.A. Evans D.C. Bensadoun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16564-16571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the effects of chlorate treatment on HS chain length in MDCK cells, we subjected [3H]HS from chlorate-treated and control cells to gel chromatography on Superose 6. The peakK av for HS from control cells was ∼0.40, corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼35 kDa (Fig. 2). HS species from chlorate-treated cells were eluted earlier than those from control cells (Fig. 2), indicating, in agreement with previous data (31Hoogewerf A.J. Cisar L.A. Evans D.C. Bensadoun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16564-16571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that such treatment results in longer HS chains. These findings further exclude the possibility that the shifts in elution positions observed on DEAE chromatography (Fig. 1) were due to differences in HS chain length. To examine whether chlorate treatment affected theN-sulfation of HS, samples of [3H]HS were cleaved by deamination with HNO2, and the patterns of depolymerization were analyzed by gel chromatography on Bio-Gel P10. At pH 1.5, HNO2 induces selective cleavage of the hexosaminidic bonds adjacent to GlcNSO3 residues (26Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). NS domains thus yield disaccharides, whereas the occurrence of one or more GlcNAc residues between the N-sulfated disaccharides results in the formation of tetrasaccharides (representing NA/NS domains) and longer oligosaccharides (NA domains). The deamination products were separated into oligosaccharides ranging from 2 to ≥12 monosaccharide units in length (Fig. 3), and the proportions of the different species were used to calculate the degrees of N-sulfation of the HS polymers (14Winterbourne D.J. Mora P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4310-4320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The four preparations showed essentially similar degrees of GlcNN-sulfation, corresponding to ∼40% of the disaccharide units, thus indicating that theN-deacetylation/N-sulfation of GlcNAc residues was highly resistant to chlorate treatment. These findings further suggest that the differences in charge density seen upon DEAE chromatography of the same HS samples (Fig. 1) would be due to variation in O-sulfation. Although treatment with 5 or 20 mm chlorate did not affect the proportions of NS, NA/NS, and NA domains, HS from cells treated with 50 mm chlorate showed somewhat reduced proportions of NS domains (11% as compared with 16% in HS from control cells) and ≥12-mer NA domains but was more abundant in 6–8-mer NA domains (Fig. 3). Furthermore, HS from cells treated with 50 mm chlorate was partially depolymerized upon treatment with HNO2 at pH 3.9, indicating the presence of N-unsubstituted GlcN units that had presumably resulted from GlcNAc N-deacetylation without subsequent N-sulfation during HS biosynthesis. Size assessment of the cleavage products by gel chromatography on Superose 6 suggested that the number of GlcNH3+ units averaged ∼3/polysaccharide chain (data not shown). No significant depolymerization was detected following similar treatment of HS that had been generated at lower chlorate concentrations. These data suggest that although the overall degree of N-sulfation remained essentially unaltered, the high dose chlorate treatment induced limited redistribution of the N-sulfate groups along the HS polymer and some formation of GlcNH3+ units. The effects of chlorate treatment on the O-sulfation of NS domains were assessed by anion exchange HPLC analysis of the disaccharide fractions isolated following HNO2, pH 1.5, treatment of [3H]HS samples (Fig. 4), as described under “Materials and Methods.” Quantification of the labeled disaccharides thus obtained from the control sample indicated heavyO-sulfation, the di-O-sulfated IdoA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3) species constituting >60% of all disaccharide units. Additional disaccharide constituents included the mono-O-sulfated GlcUA-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3), IdoA-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3), and IdoA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3 species as well as non-O-sulfated HexA-GlcNSO3 units, in proportions ranging from 5 to 17% of all disaccharide units (Fig. 4; Table I). Although chlorate treatment, as expected, decreased the overall O-sulfation in a dose-dependent fashion, the 2-O- and 6-O-sulfation reactions were differentially affected (Fig. 4; Table I). At the lower concentrations tested (5 and 20 mm), chlorate treatment reduced the proportions of disaccharide units containing 6-O-sulfated GlcNSO3 residues without significantly affecting the 2-O-sulfation of IdoA. By contrast, treatment with 50 mm chlorate appreciably reduced both 2-O- and 6-O-sulfation and led to a dramatic (>80%) loss of the di-O-sulfated IdoA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3) disaccharide units (Fig. 4; Table I). These findings suggest that the 6-O-sulfotransferase(s) that act on GlcNSO3residues of NS domains are more readily affected by chlorate treatment than is the IdoA 2-O-sulfotransferase. Altogether, the data show that GlcN 6-O-sulfation is impaired at a relatively low (20 mm) chlorate concentration, and IdoA 2-O-sulfation is impaired at a higher (50 mm) chlorate concentration, whereas GlcNAcN-deacetylation/N-sulfation resists even 50 mm chlorate.Table ICompositional disaccharide analysis of NS, NA/NS, and NA domains of HS from chlorate-treated and untreated MDCK cellsDomainChlorateDeamination productType of O-sulfationHexA-aManRGlcA-aManR- (6-OSO3)IdoA-aManR- (6-OSO3)IdoA- (2-OSO3)-aManRIdoA- (2-OSO3)-aManR- (6-OSO3)2-OSO36-OSO3Total OSO3mm%aPercentage of all disaccharides from the respective domain type.Sulfate groups/100 disaccharide unitsbSulfate groups per 100 disaccharide units within each domain type.NS05115176279781575101032453776614320137529467558133501916253010405191NA/NS078119112212357710922421252088551121113509523NDNDND55NA09154NDNDND9959433NDNDND662096ND31ND13450100NDNDNDNDNDNDNDa Percentage of all disaccharides from the respective domain type.b Sulfate groups per 100 disaccharide units within each domain type. Open table in a new tab Previous analyses of HS preparations from various bovine tissues have shown that 2-O-sulfate groups tend to be restricted to NS domains, whereas 6-O-sulfation involves also NA/NS and NA domains (at the border to NS or NA/NS domains) (5Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We therefore studied the influence of chlorate treatment on the 6-O-sulfation of NA/NS and NA domains. Fractions of tetrasaccharides and longer oligosaccharides, corresponding to NA/NS and NA domains, respectively, were recovered following treatment of [3H]HS with HNO2 at pH 1.5 and were then N-deacetylated and reacted with HNO2 at pH 3.9. Analysis of the resultant disaccharides by anion exchange HPLC revealed, in accord with the prediction, 6-O-sulfated disaccharides containing both GlcUA and IdoA residues, but no significant amounts of 2-O-sulfate groups (Fig. 5; Table I). Based on the proportional amounts of the different domain types (determined using the data in Fig. 3), it was calculated that 53% of the total 6-O-sulfate groups of HS from control cells resided in NS domains, 25% in NA/NS domains, and 22% in NA domains, whereas >95% of the 2-O-sulfate groups were found in NS domains. Compositional disaccharide analysis of NA/NS and NA domains from chlorate-treated cells indicated reduced 6-O-sulfation (Fig. 5; Table I). Notably, this reduction was more pronounced than that observed for NS domains. Treatment with 20 mm chlorate thus inhibited the 6-O-sulfation of NS domains by ∼25%, but caused ∼40 and ∼70% reductions in the 6-O-sulfation of NA/NS and NA domains, respectively. Furthermore, treatment with 50 mm chlorate reduced the 6-O-sulfation of NA/NS domains by ∼75% and completely inhibited that of NA domains, as compared with a modest ∼30% down-regulation of 6-O-sulfation in the NS domains (Fig. 6). In summary, our data show that chlorate treatment may drastically reduce overall O-sulfation of HS (up to ∼70%; Fig. 7 A) without significantly affecting N-sulfation. Whereas reduction inO-sulfation involved both 2-O- and 6-O-sulfate groups, the former components were preferentially affected at higher chlorate concentrations. The results further indicate that the reduction in 6-O-sulfation occurs in a domain-specific manner, in the order NA domains > NA/NS domains > NS domains (Figs. 5 and 6). We have used graded sodium chlorate treatment of MDCK cells along with structural analysis of metabolically labeled HS to gain information on the regulation of HS sulfation in an intact cell system. A model summarizing the results is shown in Fig. 7. The different sulfation reactions differed markedly in susceptibility to chlorate treatment. Thus, N-sulfation was essentially unaffected even in the presence of 50 mm chlorate, whereas 6-O-sulfation was progressively depressed with increasing chlorate concentration (Fig. 7 A). By contrast, 2-O-sulfation was appreciably inhibited only at chlorate concentrations >20 mm. Due to the limited effect of chlorate treatment on N-sulfation under the experimental conditions used, the general organization of HS polymers into NS, NA/NS, and NA domains was preserved in chlorate-treated cells. Compositional analysis of disaccharides representing these domains indicated that 6-O-sulfation was selectively affected, such that the NS domains retained appreciable degree of 6-O-sulfation under conditions where the sulfation of NA/NS and NA domains was severely compromized (FIG. 5, FIG. 6, FIG. 7; Table I). What are the mechanisms by which distinct sulfation events become differentially affected upon changes in the availability of PAPS? Obviously, the effects could directly reflect the PAPS affinities of the sulfotransferase species involved. According to previous studies, the apparent K m values for PAPS of the IdoA 2-O-sulfotransferase and GlcNSO36-O-sulfotransferase are 0.2 (32Kobayashi M. Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Saito M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7645-7653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and 0.44 μm(33Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4172-4179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), respectively, whereas the corresponding value proposed forN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (NDST) from mastocytoma cells is much higher (K m 40 μm) (34Orellana A. Hirsberg C.B. Wei Z. Swiedler S.J. Ishihara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2270-2276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these values would suggest a higher sensitivity of NDST than of O-sulfotransferases toward chlorate inhibition, it should be noted that the data reflect widely different assay conditions used for measuring the PAPS affinities (see Ref. 32Kobayashi M. Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Saito M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7645-7653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar for discussion). Indeed, HS biosynthesis in the intact cell is presumably catalyzed by membrane-bound enzymes that are believed to act in processive fashion (2Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), and attempts at reproducing individual steps of this process with exogenous substrates must be evaluated with care. Furthermore, the NDSTs and 6-O-sulfotransferases are present in at least three isoforms each (4Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) that may have different PAPS affinities and saccharide substrate specificities. For example, heparin-producing mast cells express predominantly NDST-2 (35Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Pikas D. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11902-11907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and transfection of 293 kidney epithelial cells with NDST-2 leads to production of HS with more extended NS domains (36Cheung W.-F. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5250-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), thus raising the possibility that this NDST isoform may be involved in the generation of “heparin-like” NS sequences. The substrate specificities of the different 6-O-sulfotransferase isoforms (see Ref. 4Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) are so far unknown, but they may potentially differ with regard to NS, NA/NS, or NA domain targets. In such a case, the 6-O-sulfotransferase isoform(s) sulfating NA and NA/NS domains would be more readily affected by the reduced PAPS availability than the isoform that sulfates the NS domains. The observed chlorate effects could also reflect differences in the mechanisms of PAPS uptake between various Golgi compartments, assuming that different sulfotransferases occur at distinct Golgi loci. At present, only scattered information is available concerning the Golgi localization of the enzymes involved in HS biosynthesis. The cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions of NDSTs 1–3 diverge (37Aikawa J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2690-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), suggesting that they may reside in different Golgi compartments. NDST-1 was recently localized to the trans-Golgi network in NDST-1 transfected murine fibroblasts (38Humphries D.E. Sullivan B.M. Aleixo M.D. Stow J.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), such that at least some N-sulfation would occur as a late Golgi event. On the other hand, mastocytoma cells treated with Brefeldin A (which blocks transport from Golgi to the trans-Golgi network) produce heparin with N-, 2-O- and 6-O-sulfate groups (39Uhlin-Hansen L. Kusche-Gullberg M. Berg E. Eriksson I. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3200-3206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), indicating that these sulfotransferase activities are also expressed proximal to the trans-Golgi network. Culture of cells in sodium chlorate-supplemented media has been widely used to study the role of sulfated glycosaminoglycans in a variety of cellular activities (19Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar, 20Delehedde M. Deudon E. Boilly B. Hondermarck H. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Kispert A. Vainio S. Shen L. Rowitch D.H. McMahon A.P. Development. 1996; 122: 2637-3627Google Scholar). The degree of undersulfation achieved by the chlorate treatment depends on the concentrations of chlorate and sulfate ions in the culture medium, because chlorate inhibits PAPS formation by competing with sulfate ions for binding to ATP-sulfyrulase (40Klaassen C.D. Boles J.W. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 404-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In the present study, the cells were grown in medium with normal sulfate supplementation, thus presumably explaining the finding that HS sulfation was only partially inhibited despite the high dose (50 mm) chlorate treatment. Our present findings, that chlorate treatment affects different HS sulfation reactions to different extents, raise the possibility that the altered HS-dependent activities seen in chlorate-treated cells may reflect selective changes in HS structures (unless a complete block of HS sulfation has been achieved). We have previously shown that HS from MDCK cells treated with 50 mm chlorate is unable to bind fibroblast growth factor-1 but binds fibroblast growth factor-2, whereas HS from untreated cells binds avidly to both fibroblast growth factor species (41Kreuger J. Prydz K. Pettersson R.F. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Chlorate treatment thus can be used as a tool to discriminate between the HS binding specificities of different protein ligands. Further studies should be conducted to study the effects of chlorate on different types of cells having potentially different sets of sulfotransferases (4Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) and different organization of the biosynthetic assembly lines in the Golgi. The possible role of PAPS availability in the control of HS biosynthesis in vivo is not understood. Interestingly, mRNA for PAPS synthetase, the human PAPS synthesizing enzyme, with both ADP sulfurylase and adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate kinase activities, is expressed at highly different levels in distinct tissues, pointing to tissue variability in the PAPS production capacity (17Girard J.-P. Baekkevold E.S. Amalric F. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In fact, PAPS concentrations found in different tissues have been reported to vary between 4 and 80 nmol/g of tissue and are considerably lower than that of UDP-GlcUA in liver (200 nmol/g) (40Klaassen C.D. Boles J.W. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 404-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). A potential additional regulatory step is translocation of PAPS from the cytosol to the Golgi lumen, through the action of a specific antiporter protein (18Hirchsberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The findings of the present study indicate that such variability may affect not only the overall degree of sulfation of HS chains, but also the fine structural details contributed by various O-sulfate groups."

E. coli has three glutaredoxins: 1, 2, and 3, each with a classical -Cys-Pro-Tyr-Cys- active site. Glutaredoxin 2 is the major glutathione disulfide oxidoreductase in E. coli, but its function remains unknown. In this report glutaredoxin 2 is shown to be the most effective hydrogen donor for the reduction of arsenate by ArsC. Analysis of single or double cysteine-to-serine substitutions in the active site of the three glutaredoxins indicated that only the N-terminal cysteine residue is essential for activity. This suggests that, during the catalytic cycle, ArsC forms a mixed disulfide with GSH before being reduced by glutaredoxin to regenerate the active ArsC reductase.

This suggests that, during the catalytic cycle, ArsC forms a mixed disulfide with GSH before being reduced by glutaredoxin to regenerate the active ArsC reductase. glutaredoxin 2-hydroxyethyldisulfide polymerase chain reaction 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid Glutaredoxins (Grx)1 are glutathione-dependent dithiol hydrogen donors forEscherichia coli enzymes such as ribonucleotide reductase, 3′-phosphoadenylsulfate reductase, and arsenate reductase. The product of the grxA gene, glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1), was originally identified as a hydrogen donor to ribonucleotide reductase (1Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In searching for alternate reductants of ribonucleotide reductase, two new glutaredoxins, Grx2 and Grx3, were identified, both of which catalyzed GSH-disulfide reduction of 2-hydroxyethyldisulfide (HED) in a coupled system with NADPH and glutathione reductase (2Åslund F. Ehn B. Miranda-Vizuete A. Pueyo C. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9813-9817Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Grx2 was shown to be the predominant glutaredoxin in E. coli cells, with an intracellular concentration of 5 μm compared with 0.2 μm for Grx1 and 2.4 μm for Grx3. Grx2 also has a higher turnover number than the other two glutaredoxins for reduction of a mixed disulfide of GSH and HED. As a consequence of its high concentration and turnover, Grx2 provides over 80% of the GSH-oxidoreductase activity in E. coli for reduction of GSH mixed disulfides. However, Grx2 is not a hydrogen donor to ribonucleotide reductase, and no function has yet been assigned for this protein (3Vlamis-Gardikas A. Åslund F. Spyrou G. Bergman T. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11236-11243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Resistance to arsenicals and antimonials in E. coli is conferred by arsenic resistance (ars) operons (4Rosen B.P. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 207-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). ThearsC gene product of the ars operon of plasmid R773 is an arsenate reductase (5Oden K.L. Gladysheva T.B. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). ArsC reduces arsenate to arsenite, which is subsequently extruded from the cell, conferring resistance.In vitro reductase activity requires both GSH and Grx1 (6Gladysheva T.B. Oden K.L. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin is not able to couple to the R773 arsenate reductase. In contrast, the unrelated arsenate reductase of Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pI258 requires thioredoxin and cannot use GSH and glutaredoxin (7Ji G. Garber E.A.E. Armes L.G. Chen C.M. Fuchs J.A. Silver S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7294-7299Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the relative efficiency of Grx1, Grx2, and Grx3 to serve as hydrogen donor for the reduction of arsenate by ArsC. Each glutaredoxin supported arsenite formation, with the relative efficiencies being Grx2 > Grx3 > Grx1. This is the first demonstration of a role of Grx2 in a physiological reaction. Glutaredoxins have two active site cysteine residues in the sequence Cys-Pro-Tyr-Cys. The N-terminal cysteine has been shown to be required for both protein disulfide reduction and reduction of mixed protein-glutathione disulfides (8Bushweller J.H. Åslund F. Wuthrich K. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The other cysteine residue is required for the former but not for the latter. Here the codon for either of the two cysteine residues in grxA,grxB, and grxC was mutated to a serine codon, and the effect on arsenate reductase activity examined with the altered Grx1, Grx2, and Grx3. Mutation of the codon for the C-terminal active site cysteine of any of the three glutaredoxins had no effect on ArsC activity. In contrast, Grx1, Grx2, or Grx3 with a cysteine to serine substitution in the N-terminal residue were unable to serve as hydrogen donors to ArsC-catalyzed arsenate reduction. These results are consistent with a reaction cycle in which ArsC forms a mixed disulfide with glutathione, where the role of glutaredoxin would be to reduce the mixed disulfide, regenerating reduced arsenate reductase.

E. coli strain BL21(DE3) bearing eachgrx gene in vector plasmid pET28a was grown in 1 liter of Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin with shaking at 37 °C. At an A 600 nm = 0.5–0.6, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added as inducer to a final concentration of 0.4 mm for Grx1 and its mutants, 0.5 mm for Grx2 and its mutants, or 0.1 mm for Grx3 and its mutants. The culture was shaken for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed once with buffer A (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, containing 20 mmimidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 8 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 20% glycerol). The cells were suspended in buffer A at a ratio of 5 ml of buffer/g of cells and lysed by a single passing through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. Diisopropylfluorophosphate (2.5 μl/g of wet cells) was added to the lysate immediately after lysis. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant solution was loaded at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min onto a 5 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was then washed with 100 ml of buffer A containing 0.02 m imidazole followed by elution with 100 ml of the buffer A containing 0.2 m inidazole. Protein-containing fractions were identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), pooled, and concentrated using a Millipore Ultrafree-15 BIOMAX-5K or -10K centrifugal filter (Millipore) at 2,000 × g. All purified protein was stored at −70 °C. Protein concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm according to the methods of Gill and von Hippel (14Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar) using the following extinction coefficients: ArsC, 4,080m−1 cm−1; Grx1s: wild type, 11,050 m−1 cm−1 for Grx1; both C11S and C14S, 10,930 m−1cm−1, C11/14S, 10,810m−1 cm−1; Grx2s: wild type, 21,860 m−1 cm−1; both C9S and C12S, 21,740 m−1 cm−1; C9/12S, 21,620 m−1 cm−1;Grx3s: wild type, 4,200 m−1cm−1; both C12S and C15S, 4,080m−1 cm−1; and C12/15S, 3,960m−1 cm−1. Arsenate reductase activity was assayed by a modification of a glutathione disulfide oxidoreductase-dependent assay for glutaredoxin (15Bjornberg O. Holmgren A. Protein Expression Purif. 1991; 2: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The assay buffer was 50 mm MOPS and 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.25 mm NADPH, 15 nm yeast glutathione reductase, 1 mm GSH, 10 mm sodium arsenate, and 6.3 μm ArsC. Glutaredoxin was added as indicated below. Reductase activity was monitored by the decrease in NADPH absorption at 340 nm and is expressed as nanomoles of NADPH oxidized per milligram of ArsC using a molar extinction coefficient of 6,200 for NADPH. To allow for rapid purification of recombinant glutaredoxins, the sequence for 20 codons was added to the 5′-end of each glutaredoxin gene, including the sequence for a thrombin recognition site and six histidine codons, adding approximately 2 kDa to the molecular mass of each glutaredoxin species. Each protein was purified by chelate affinity chromatography. In saturating amounts, the three His-tagged glutaredoxins reduced arsenate in rates identical to those of their wild type counterparts lacking the six histidine tag (data not shown). Because of the ease of purification, all subsequent assays were performed with the His-tagged glutaredoxins. Each of the three glutaredoxins was able to serve as a hydrogen donor to ArsC-catalyzed arsenate reduction (Fig. 1). At saturating concentrations, the turnover numbers (k cat) of the three proteins were within a factor of two to three of each other (Table II). In contrast, theK m of ArsC for the three glutaredoxins differed by 3 orders of magnitude. ArsC exhibited a 100-fold lowerK m for Grx2 than Grx3 and more than 1,000-fold lower when compared with Grx1. Thus, the catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) for Grx2 is approximately 2 orders of magnitude greater than that for Grx3 and approximately 3 orders of magnitude greater than that for Grx1. These results suggest that Grx2 is most likely the major hydrogen donor for the reduction of arsenate to arsenite, the first credible physiological role found for Grx2. Since it is the major GSH-disulfide oxidoreductase in E. coli, the identification of an electron acceptor is important for understanding the function of Grx2.Table IIKinetic constants for glutaredoxin as hydrogen donor for reduction of arsenate by ArsCGlutaredoxinK m aK m for glutaredoxin at 6.3 μm ArsC and 10 mm sodium arsenate.V maxbCalculated per milligram of ArsC.k catk cat/K mμmnmol/minmgs −1m −1 s −1Grx14.211180.30.071 × 106Grx20.0035140.1446.7 × 106Grx30.33390.090.30 × 106a K m for glutaredoxin at 6.3 μm ArsC and 10 mm sodium arsenate.b Calculated per milligram of ArsC. Open table in a new tab It should be pointed out, however, that disruption of the gene for any of the three glutaredoxins does not eliminate arsenate resistance conferred by the ars operon (data not shown). This is not surprising in light of the redundancy of glutaredoxins and glutaredoxin-like proteins (16Jordan A. Åslund F. Pontis E. Reichard P. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18044-18050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and suggests the presence of an additional yet unidentified glutaredoxin activity. Similarly, in vivo reduction of ribonucleotides by ribonucleotide reductase is not affected by single or multiple disruptions of the trxAor grxA genes. However, cells lacking both Trx1 and Grx1 have highly induced ribonucleotide reductase (17Miranda-Vizuete A. Martinez-Galisteo E. Åslund F. Lopez-Barea J. Pueyo C. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16631-16637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later work resulted in the isolation of a second thioredoxin (Trx2) encoded by thetrxC gene (18Miranda-Vizuete A. Damdimopoulos A.E. Gustafsson J. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30841-30847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 19Stewart E.J. Åslund F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5543-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). On the other hand, 3′-phosphoadenylsulfate reduction is more specifically coupled to Trx1, Trx2 or Grx1 (20Lillig C.H. Prior A. Schwenn J.D. Åslund F. Ritz D. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7695-7698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and a double disruption of the trxA andgrxA genes resulted in cysteine auxotrophy (21Russel M. Model P. Holmgren A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1923-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Glutaredoxins can reduce either intramolecular disulfides (e.g. ribonucleotide reductase) or mixed disulfides between a thiol compound and GSH (e.g. the complex between HED and GSH). Grx1, Grx2, and Grx3 each have the conserved active site sequence Cys-Pro-Tyr-Cys. Both cysteine residues are required for protein disulfide reduction (8Bushweller J.H. Åslund F. Wuthrich K. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). For reducing glutathione-containing mixed disulfides, however, the N-terminal cysteine is sufficient (8Bushweller J.H. Åslund F. Wuthrich K. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 22Gravina S.A. Mieyal J.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3368-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In the monothiol mechanism, the N-terminal cysteine of glutaredoxin reacts with the glutathionyl moiety of the mixed disulfide, forming the mixed disulfide intermediate GrxS-SG. Simultaneously, the non-glutathione component is released in its reduced form. The GrxS-SG can be further reduced by GSH to give reduced glutaredoxin and GSSG. To determine which glutaredoxin mode was involved in ArsC-catalyzed arsenate reduction, mutant glutaredoxin genes encoding single and double cysteine-to-serine substitutions of the three E. coliglutaredoxins were constructed. Glutaredoxins with their N-terminal cysteine changed to serine (Grx1 C11S, Grx2 C9S, or Grx3 C12S) were unable to serve as hydrogen donors for the reduction of arsenate (Fig. 2). The three double substitutions (Grx1 C11/14S, Grx2 C9/12S, or Grx3 C12/15S) exhibited the same phenotype as the single substitutions. In contrast, glutaredoxins with intact N-terminal cysteines but serine substitutions in the C-terminal cysteines (Grx1 C14S, Grx2 C12S, or Grx3 C15S) retained nearly complete wild type activity. Thus, for ArsC catalysis, Cys11 for Grx1, Cys9 for Grx2, or Cys12 for Grx3 was sufficient. These results are consistent with formation of a mixed protein-SG disulfide during the reaction cycle, as indicated in the following proposed reaction scheme (where ES− represents the Cys12 thiolate of ArsC). ES−+As(V)⇆ES−·As(V)(Reaction 1) ES−·As(V)+GS−⇆ES­SG+As(III)(Reaction 2) ES­SG+Grx2­S−⇆ES−+GS­SGrx2(Reaction 3) GS­SGrx2+GS−⇆Grx2S−+GSSG(Reaction 4) GSSG+NADPH+H+⇆2GSH+NADP+(Reaction 5) In this proposed minimal reaction scheme, Reaction 1 shows noncovalent binding of arsenate to ArsC. Since ArsC is competitively inhibited by other tetrahedral oxyanions such as phosphate and sulfate (6Gladysheva T.B. Oden K.L. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), the first step represents binding at an oxyanion binding site. In Reaction 2, reduction of As(V) to As(III) is achieved by one electron donated by the thiolate of Cys12 of ArsC and another electron derived from the thiolate of GSH. Thus, Reaction 2 is likely to be the sum of several steps, one possibly involving a protein thiyl radical. In Reaction 3 Grx2 is indicated as the hydrogen donor for reduction of the ArsCS-SG mixed disulfide. This is followed by regeneration of reduced Grx2 by GSH, forming GSSG in reaction (4Rosen B.P. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 207-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The GSSG will finally be reduced to 2 mol of GSH by NADPH and glutathione reductase in Reaction 5. Since Grx2 has a catalytic efficiency that is 1 or 2 orders of magnitude greater than Grx3 or Grx1, what governs the glutaredoxin specificity of arsenate reduction? Since the three E. coliglutaredoxins have similar activities in an assay using reduction of the mixed disulfide between 2-hydroxyethyldisulfide and GSH (23Holmgren A. Åslund F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to speculate that specific protein-protein interactions between ArsC and each of the three glutaredoxins are involved, and the efficiency of those interactions determines the rate of reaction (3Vlamis-Gardikas A. Åslund F. Spyrou G. Bergman T. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11236-11243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of Grx2 in the ArsC reduction system is the first example of a monothiol mechanism in a substrate reduction involving electron transport by a glutaredoxin."

This often occurs close to exons, but may also occur deep within introns, creating either a novel donor or acceptor site that, in conjunction with a nearby cryptic splice site of the opposite polarity, defines a novel, aberrant exon that the spliceosome recognizes and includes into the mature message.

Nature. 1996; 379: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (2095) Google Scholar). Usage of such splice sites results in the abnormal inclusion of intron sequences in the mature transcripts with a wide range of clinical consequences. The exon-shuffling theory (44Gilbert W. Nature. 1978; 271: 501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar) proposes that introns serve as reservoirs of new coding sequence and evolutionary potential and mutations like 3849 + 10 kb C → T are mechanistically compatible with this theory. From the standpoint of immediate clinical consequences, however, molecular derangements of this class must be detrimental in the vast majority of individuals.The likelihood that an RNA sequence will be recognized by the spliceosome depends chiefly on how well it approximates the consensus splice site sequence. The relation between the consensus sequence and a given splice site may be expressed numerically using the scoring system of Shapiro and Senapathy (45Shapiro M.B. Senapathy P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7155-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). Relative to the consensus splice site score of 100, 3849 + 10 kb C → T creates a novel donor site with a score of 88.9; the score of the non-mutated sequence at this site is 70.6. By comparison, the native intron 19 donor and acceptor splice sites have scores of 83.2 and 86.7, respectively. This analysis suggests that the novel splice site should be preferred over the native ones by the splicing machinery. Moreover, and probably more importantly, the novel splice site in conjunction with the cryptic splice site located 84 nucleotides upstream in the intron creates an exon-like sequence. The exon definition mechanism predicts that such sequence should be efficiently included in the spliced mRNA (42Berget S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2411-2414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Interestingly, despite the high score of the novel donor splice site and creation of the aberrant exon, the impediment to normal splicing is not absolute. In vivo, but not in vitro, as shown by our results, approximately 8% of the CFTR transcripts are normal length (13Highsmith Jr., W.E. Burch L.H. Zhou Z. Olsen J.C. Boat T.E. Spock A. Gorvoy J.D. Quittell L. Friedman K.J. Silverman L.M. Boucher R.C. Knowles M.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 974-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). This low level of wild-type mRNAs is thought to account for the mild, if variable, phenotypes in patients with the 3849 + 10 kb C → T mutation (13Highsmith Jr., W.E. Burch L.H. Zhou Z. Olsen J.C. Boat T.E. Spock A. Gorvoy J.D. Quittell L. Friedman K.J. Silverman L.M. Boucher R.C. Knowles M.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 974-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 27Dreyfus D.H.

The retention of wild-type splice sites on 3849 + 10 kb C → T alleles not only permits low levels of normal splicing but also suggested a mechanism by which wild-type splicing could be restored. If usage of the aberrant splicing elements were prevented by antisense oligonucleotides, it seemed likely that the spliceosome will revert to normal utilization of the native splice elements.Using two different CFTR cDNA expression vectors, LCFSN and pCF1-CFTR, in three different cell lines (3T3, CFT1, and C127), we have demonstrated that antisense oligonucleotides complementary to either the aberrant donor or the cryptic acceptor splice sites promoted the formation of correctly spliced CFTR mRNA. This corrective effect was specific for the oligonucleotides with full complementarity to the 18 bp of sequence bracketing each novel splice site. Oligonucleotides with two nucleotide mismatches and an oligonucleotide of wholly unrelated sequence showed no efficacy for the correction of splicing.The correction of aberrant splicing in multiple cellular contexts speaks to the potential broad applicability of this therapeutic modality. This approach has been also shown to be effective in correction of splicing of human thalassemic β-globin pre-mRNAs (28Dominski Z. Kole R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8673-8677Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 29Sierakowska H. Sambade M.J. Agrawal S. Kole R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genet. 1998; 7: 1083-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).Patients with 3849 + 10 kb C → T reportedly produce one major aberrant mRNA isoform reflecting the inclusion of 84 bp of intron sequence (13Highsmith Jr., W.E. Burch L.H. Zhou Z. Olsen J.C. Boat T.E. Spock A. Gorvoy J.D. Quittell L. Friedman K.J. Silverman L.M. Boucher R.C. Knowles M.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 974-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). RT-PCR analysis of splicing in the 3T3- and C127-derived mutant cell lines, however, identified two bands associated with aberrant processing. One represented the expected 84-bp insertion, while the second band incorporated the first 40 bp of intron 19 due to splicing at a cryptic splice donor site (CA‖‖GTAAGT) at position 3849 + 41, which, surprisingly, is present but does not appear to be active, in native intron 19 sequence. This site has a Shapiro-Senapathy score of 79.4 in primates and 80.1 in rodents (45Shapiro M.B. Senapathy P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7155-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar) and, if activated, should disrupt the reading frame of the mature message. It is possible that the novel sequence context within the mini-intron may be responsible for its use and/or that the heterologous expression of the constructs in murine cells that do not normally express CFTRgave rise, in vitro, to this unexpected splicing pathway. However, since this splice site is present in the nativeCFTR intron 19, one must consider that its activation may occur in some patients or in specific tissue contexts. If this is true, the level of usage of this cryptic donor site may contribute to variable disease severity in patients with identical mutational genotypes of the CFTR gene.The anti-stop oligonucleotide that anneals to the vicinity of the ochre stop codon in the aberrant exon promoted wild-type splicing. This result, which was equally apparent in both CFT1- and C127-derived mutant cells, should be viewed in light of the exon definition model that postulates interaction between spliceosome components bridging an exon (42Berget S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2411-2414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide that sterically inhibits this bridging would impair recognition of the exon as sequence to be retained in the mature message. Blocking of the premature stop codon itself was probably not pertinent to this effect.Superior correction of splicing was seen when two rather than one antisense oligonucleotide were transfected in concert, e.g.targeting the 5′ and 3′ splice sites simultaneously. Presumably one oligonucleotide corrects splicing among those transcripts left untouched by the other oligonucleotide. A rigorously quantitative assessment will be required to determine if the effect is synergistic or merely additive.It is logical to assume a priori that correction of splicing would be accompanied by increased production of normal protein. The ribosome should translate correctly processed CFTR mRNAs equally without regard to how they came to be correctly spliced. C127 cells stably transfected with the aberrant pCF1-CFTR transgene produced CFTR protein upon treatment with the same oligonucleotides shown to correct splicing. The increase in detectable protein was both sequence- and dose-dependent, with dual oligonucleotide treatment associated with the highest level of protein. Furthermore, we note that the CFTR protein formed in response to antisense oligonucleotide treatment was appropriately glycosylated, suggesting that CFTR polypeptide processing beyond simple translation has also occurred, presumably leading to cell surface expression and chloride conductance.The potential for antisense-mediated approaches to achieve utility in the clinical arena will depend on several factors. Splicing mutations that evoke aberrant inclusion of intron sequence are currently regarded as infrequent. Although several mutations that fit this category have been reported (8Spritz R.A.

Analysis of the changes in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) with specific fluorescent probes showed a rapid and persistent increase of DeltaPsi(m), a potential that usually decreases in cells undergoing apoptosis through mitochondrial-dependent mechanisms. Using confocal microscopy, the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol was characterized as an early event preceding the rise of DeltaPsi(m). The cytochrome c from cells treated with nitric oxide donors was modified chemically, probably through the formation of nitrotyrosine residues, suggesting the synthesis of peroxynitrite in the mitochondria. These results indicate that nitric oxide-dependent apoptosis in macrophages occurs in the presence of a sustained increase of DeltaPsi(m), and that the chemical modification and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria precede the changes of DeltaPsi(m).-Hortelano, S., Alvarez, A.

This method involves treatment of platelets with a fusion peptide, calpastat, consisting of the cell-penetrating signal sequence from Kaposi's fibroblast growth factor connected to a calpain-inhibiting consensus sequence derived from calpastatin. Calpastat specifically inhibits thrombin peptide (SFLLR)-induced α-granule secretion (IC50 = 20 μm) during the first 30 s of activation, thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (IC50 = 50 μm), and platelet spreading on glass surfaces (IC50 = 34 μm).

These findings together suggest a regulatory role for calpain in early cytoskeletal remodeling, including secretion, aggregation, and spreading.There has been growing interest in the role of calpain in the site-specific cleavage of actin-associated proteins such as talin, actin-binding protein 280 (ABP 2801 or filamin) (7Phillips D.R.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4843-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) are also cleaved by calpain during platelet activation. Nonetheless, despite the identification of cytoskeletal and kinase/phosphatase targets for calpain in platelets, a functional role for calpain in aggregation and spreading has not been demonstrated.A major obstacle to determining the physiological functions of calpain in platelets is lack of specific cell-permeant inhibitors. Peptidyl calpain inhibitors inhibit other cysteine proteases, including cathepsins (24Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In addition, peptidyl calpain inhibitors require high micromolar concentrations to inhibit calpain in platelets (25Inomata M. Hayashi M. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Tsubuki S. Saido T.C. Kawashima S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), in contrast to fibroblasts (12Potter D.A. Tirnauer J.S. Janssen R. Croall D.E. Hughes C.N. Fiacco K.A. Mier J.W. Maki M. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The lack of efficacy of peptidyl calpain inhibitors in platelets may be due to the high calpain content of platelets, where calpain represents 2% of platelet protein (26Schmaier A.H. Bradford H.N. Lundberg D. Farber A. Colman R.W. Blood. 1990; 75: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While calpain's reversible biological inhibitor, calpastatin, is the only known specific inhibitor of calpain (24Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Enzyme Regul. 1980; 19: 407-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) simple strategies for increasing calpastatin in platelets have not been available. Calpastatin is cell-impermeant, and thus unsuitable for conventional studies of platelet activation (24Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). To solve this problem, we developed a cell-permeant specific inhibitor of calpain by joining the minimal inhibitory sequence of calpastatin to the cell-penetrating signal sequence of k-FGF, which confers cellular peptide importation (33Lin Y.Z. Yao S.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar, 34Liu K.Y. Timmons S. Lin Y.Z. Hawiger J. Proc.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5305-5308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Using this specific cell-penetrating inhibitor and a set of peptidyl calpain inhibitors, with appropriate specificity controls, we demonstrate that calpain regulates platelet degranulation, aggregation, and spreading.DISCUSSIONAlthough calpain is activated in agonist-stimulated platelets, the precise roles of calpain in platelet activation are unknown. The present study demonstrates the Ca2+ and calpain dependence of platelet secretion, aggregation, and spreading. A cell-permeant calpastatin motif, calpastat, and three distinct peptidyl calpain inhibitors, calpeptin, MDL, and E64d, block platelet secretion, aggregation, and spreading. These inhibitors block the expression of P-selectin on the platelet surface, remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton during filopodial and lamellipodial protrusion formation, and cleavage of the membrane-associated proteins ABP 280 and talin during platelet activation events. These results implicate calpain in Ca2+-associated secretion events occurring during the first 30 s of platelet activation by the thrombin receptor agonist peptide, SFLLR. This suggests a novel and direct connection between thrombin receptor signaling and early activation of calpain. Blocking of platelet aggregation and spreading by calpain inhibition also indicates that calpain regulates later platelet activation events involving integrin function, as well as actin remodeling. These results suggest that calpain plays a critical, rate-limiting role in the activation of platelets by thrombin, promoting remodeling of actin networks and the platelet membrane cytoskeleton.Prior studies of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation have demonstrated that an early sign of calpain activation, autolysis, occurs within 30–60 s of agonist stimulation, but not before (15Fox J.E. Taylor R.G. Taffarel M. Boyles J.K. Goll D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Calpain also rapidly translocates to the plasma membrane within 10 s of thrombin stimulation, but it has been proposed that this event alone is not sufficient for calpain activation (15Fox J.E. Taylor R.G. Taffarel M. Boyles J.K. Goll D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Activation of calpain was reported to be dependent upon both engagement of integrin IIb/IIIa (15Fox J.E. Taylor R.G. Taffarel M. Boyles J.K. Goll D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and stirring (16Saido T.C. Suzuki H. Yamazaki H. Tanoue K. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7422-7426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Fox J.E. Reynolds C.C. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9973-9981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Wallace R.W. Tallant E.A. McManus M.C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2766-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, α-granule secretion due to thrombin receptor stimulation is independent of integrin IIb/IIIa function (50Cramer E.M. Berger G. Berndt M.C. Blood. 1994; 84: 1722-1730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Furman M.I. Liu L. Benoit S.E. Becker R.C. Barnard M.R. Michelson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3082-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The results presented here indicate that calpain is functionally active in thrombin peptide-stimulated α-granule secretion during the first 30 s of activation, suggesting that rapid translocation of calpain to the platelet membrane may be of functional significance earlier in platelet activation than had been previously anticipated. Of interest, activation of calpain, measured by autolysis, is greatly reduced in Glanzmann's thrombasthenia platelets (15Fox J.E. Taylor R.G. Taffarel M. Boyles J.K. Goll D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), despite the fact that α-granule secretion is not defective (50Cramer E.M. Berger G. Berndt M.C. Blood. 1994; 84: 1722-1730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Furman M.I. Liu L. Benoit S.E. Becker R.C. Barnard M.R. Michelson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3082-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It is possible that secretion may require activation of only a small fraction of the calpain pool, not detectable by Western blotting. We hypothesize that there may be a direct connection between thrombin receptor engagement and initial calpain activation that may be sufficient to activate secretion and precede integrin IIb/IIIa mechanisms. Further studies will address this possibility.While Ca2+ transients regulate secretory processes in platelets and other cells, its precise role in platelet degranulation has yet to be elucidated. Our investigations have demonstrated that inhibition of calpain by calpastat or by peptidyl inhibitors resulted in 50–80% inhibition of P-selectin surface expression and α-granule secretion. Consistent with these findings are reports that calpain regulates secretion in type II alveolar cells (52Zimmerman U.J. Speicher D.W. Fisher A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1137: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 53Zimmerman U.J. Wang M. Liu L. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 54Li H.L. Feinstein S.I. Liu L. Zimmerman U.J. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). At present it is unknown whether resting platelet α-granules exist both pre-docked at the plasma membrane and free in the cytoplasm. The ability of the calpain inhibitors to block 50–80%, but not all α-granule secretion may result from a specific role for calpain in initial events enabling the priming of undocked rather than pre-docked granule stores.Recently, it was demonstrated that calpain cleaves spectrin, α-SNAP, syntaxin I, and synaptobrevin II during activation-directed degranulation of type II alveolar cells (52Zimmerman U.J. Speicher D.W. Fisher A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1137: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 55Zimmerman U.J.P. Malek S.K. Liu L. Li H.L. TUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our recent finding that SNARE family members are involved in α-granule secretion raises the possibility that calpain proteolysis facilitates granule fusion via cleavage of α-granule associated SNARE family members (5Flaumenhaft R. Croce K. Chen E. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2492-2501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The role of proteolysis in vesicle fusion is nonetheless unknown, and future investigations will examine the cleavage of these proteins during platelet activation. At present, our experiments also have not eliminated the possibility that calpain is involved in upstream signaling events required for α-granule secretion.Platelet aggregation draws on coordinated regulation of numerous signaling, cytoskeletal and adhesive processes. Calpain may be involved in the proteolytic cleavage of signaling kinases and phosphatases to active or inactive forms. Calpain cleavage of protein kinase C generates a constitutively active isoform, protein kinase M (PKM), which no longer requires diacyl glycerol for activity (24Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Calpain cleavage of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphatase results in inactivation of this enzyme, which may facilitate platelet activation by elevating levels of phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (21Norris F.A. Atkins R.C. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10987-10989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 56Hartwig J.H. Bokoch G.M. Carpenter C.L. Janmey P.A. Taylor L.A. Toker A. Stossel T.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Alternatively, calpain may facilitate the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate 4-kinase, through mechanisms that remain to be fully elucidated (57Banfic H. Downes C.P. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11630-11637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is also possible that calpain regulates the clustering and ligand engagement of platelet integrins, which are involved both in signaling process and in adhesive events. Thrombin-induced cleavage of the cytoplasmic domain of β3integrin is dependent on calpain (18Du X. Saido T.C. Tsubuki S. Indig F.E. Williams M.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26146-26151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and calpain is known to regulate integrin clustering in other cell types (8Stewart M.P. McDowall A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar).In the present study, inhibition of calpain with calpastat or the peptidyl calpain inhibitors blocks cell spreading. This finding is consistent with our previous report that calpain regulates spreading in fibroblasts (12Potter D.A. Tirnauer J.S. Janssen R. Croall D.E. Hughes C.N. Fiacco K.A. Mier J.W. Maki M. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Notably, the MICs of calpeptin, MDL, and E64d for spreading are comparable to the MICs of these inhibitors for spreading of fibroblasts (12Potter D.A. Tirnauer J.S. Janssen R. Croall D.E. Hughes C.N. Fiacco K.A. Mier J.W. Maki M. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). When calpain is inhibited in platelets, filopodial and lamellipodial protrusion formation is significantly attenuated, demonstrating a role for calpain in remodeling of the cortical actin cytoskeleton in platelets. Together, the platelet and fibroblast results suggest that modulation of cell spreading by calpain may be a general mechanism used by a variety of different cell types.There are at least three mechanisms by which calpain could modulate platelet spreading. First, calpain cleavage of actin filament capping complexes may expose barbed ends for polymerization and/or untethering the filamentous actin cytoskeleton from the plasma membrane. Although there is evidence to support a role for calpain in the uncapping of β-actin filaments through cleavage of the cytoskeleton-membrane linking protein, ezrin (11Shuster C.B. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 58Shuster C.B. Lin A.Y. Nayak R. Herman I.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 35: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), ezrin is not abundant in platelets (59Amieva M.R. Furthmayr H. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The dominant member of the ezrin/radixin/moesin family found in platelets is moesin, which is not a calpain substrate (60Shcherbina A. Bretscher A. Kenney D.M. Remold-O'Donnell E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Recently, adducin, a calpain substrate, has been identified as an actin capping protein in a variety of cell types (61Kuhlman P.A. Hughes C.A. Bennett V. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7986-7991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 62Kuhlman P.A. Fowler V.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13461-13472Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 63Li X. Matsuoka Y. Bennett V. J. Biol.

A. 1993; 90: 3398-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It is possible that adducin may be a calpain target during actin remodeling events in platelets. Calpain might also facilitate platelet spreading by raising intracellular levels of the 4-phosphate phosphatidylinositols (PIs) PI (4,5)P and PI (3,4)P, which can directly uncap β-actin filaments (56Hartwig J.H. Bokoch G.M. Carpenter C.L. Janmey P.A. Taylor L.A. Toker A. Stossel T.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar,66Schafer D.A. Jennings P.B. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Finally, calpain could facilitate platelet spreading by activating PKC (19Pontremoli S. Melloni E. Sparatore B. Michetti M. Salamino F. Horecker B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 706-712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is functionally active during platelet activation and is known to facilitate cell spreading by an undetermined mechanism (67Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Regulated proteolysis plays an important role in the regulation of intracellular signal transduction and cytoskeletal remodeling events. Our data provide strong evidence that calpain is a critical Ca2+ triggered molecular switch that regulates a series of complex processes during platelet activation. Identification of the critical physiologic substrates of calpain during platelet activation will add considerably to our understanding of calpain's specific role in cell activation. Reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is required for a number of platelet activation processes, including shape change, aggregation and spreading. In rapid response to platelet agonists, intracellular Ca2+ transients regulate the early platelet activation events of shape change (1Yoshida K. Dubyak G. Nachmias V.T. FEBS Lett. 1986; 206: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 2Winokur R. Hartwig J.H. Blood. 1995; 85: 1796-1804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and α-granule secretion (3White J.G.

Haemostasis. 1976; 5: 176-188PubMed Google Scholar) and spreading, occurring within minutes. Since the discovery of the Ca2+ -activated protease, calpain, in platelets (7Phillips D.R. Jakabova M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5602-5605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there has been considerable interest in determining whether the Ca2+ transients occurring early in platelet activation function, in part, through calpain-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling. Calpain has been found to modulate the late event of platelet-mediated fibrin clot retraction (8Stewart M.P. McDowall A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 9Hato T. Pampori N. Shattil S.J. J.

We have recently found that calpain regulates actin remodeling events of endothelial wound healing and fibroblast spreading, including lamellipodial and filopodial protrusion formation (11Shuster C.B.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Calpain has also been implicated in cell motility through its effects on release of rear integrin contacts (13Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P. Lu Q. Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Ginsberg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32719-32722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Calpain translocates to the plasma membrane within seconds of platelet activation, where it is activated and may cleave cytoskeletal proteins (14Fox J.E. Reynolds C.C. Morrow J.S. Phillips D.R.

These findings together suggest a regulatory role for calpain in early cytoskeletal remodeling, including secretion, aggregation, and spreading. There has been growing interest in the role of calpain in the site-specific cleavage of actin-associated proteins such as talin, actin-binding protein 280 (ABP 2801 or filamin) (7Phillips D.R.

https://openalex.org/W2140403106,"The basic helix-loop-helix/Per-ARNT-Sim homology domain dioxin receptor (DR) translocates to the nucleus upon binding of aromatic hydrocarbon ligands typified by dioxin, whereupon it partners the Ah receptor nuclear translocator and initiates transcription. Concurrently, ligand binding down-regulates receptor levels via an unknown mechanism. In this study we show that receptor levels are dependent upon cellular compartmentalization, with entry into the nucleus leading to the rapid destruction of the DR. Ligand-induced DR translocation was bypassed by adding a heterologous nuclear localization signal to the DR, creating a constitutively nuclear form of the dioxin receptor (DRNLS). The DRNLS protein was shown to be unstable with a half-life of ≤1 h whether partnering ARNT or HSP90. Thus, the structural changes induced by ligand binding have no inherent effect on DR stability but are critical in transporting the receptor prior to degradation. The proteolytic pathway that degrades the nuclear receptor is suggested to involve ubiquitination as it was inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or co-expression of DRNLS with the ubiquitin mutant UbK48R. Incubation of cells expressing DRNLS with the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin resulted in the rapid phosphorylation and ubiquitination of DRNLS, suggesting that a nuclear kinase is required to trigger receptor proteolysis. Overall, this study demonstrates a novel mechanism of proteolysis whereby the simple relocation of a transcription factor from cytoplasm to nucleus initiates its rapid destruction. The basic helix-loop-helix/Per-ARNT-Sim homology domain dioxin receptor (DR) translocates to the nucleus upon binding of aromatic hydrocarbon ligands typified by dioxin, whereupon it partners the Ah receptor nuclear translocator and initiates transcription. Concurrently, ligand binding down-regulates receptor levels via an unknown mechanism. In this study we show that receptor levels are dependent upon cellular compartmentalization, with entry into the nucleus leading to the rapid destruction of the DR. Ligand-induced DR translocation was bypassed by adding a heterologous nuclear localization signal to the DR, creating a constitutively nuclear form of the dioxin receptor (DRNLS). The DRNLS protein was shown to be unstable with a half-life of ≤1 h whether partnering ARNT or HSP90. Thus, the structural changes induced by ligand binding have no inherent effect on DR stability but are critical in transporting the receptor prior to degradation. The proteolytic pathway that degrades the nuclear receptor is suggested to involve ubiquitination as it was inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or co-expression of DRNLS with the ubiquitin mutant UbK48R.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In general, bHLH/PAS proteins function as heterodimers with an appropriate cellular stimulus providing the signal for dimerization and subsequent DNA binding. In many cases one component of the heterodimer is specialized to respond to individual cellular signals such as xenobiotic influx or hypoxia, whereas the other is a general partner factor, ARNT (Ah receptornuclear translocator), which functions in the absence of exogenous stimuli in the nuclear compartment. In response to ligand binding, the DR translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus whereupon it dimerizes with ARNT and binds to its cognate DNA recognition sequence (2Okey A.B. Riddick D.S.

In comparison with the rapidly turned over bHLH/PAS hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), the cytoplasmic DR is a stable protein with a half-life reported to be approximately 8 h (6Swanson H.I. Perdew G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, both proteins contain NLS regions that confer nuclear translocation in response to their respective physiological stimuli (7Ikuta T. Eguchi H. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2895-2904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar,8Kallio P.J. Okamoto K. O'Brien S. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When these sequences are mutated or deleted, DR (7Ikuta T. Eguchi H. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2895-2904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and HIF1α (8Kallio P.J. Okamoto K. O'Brien S. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) fail to enter the nuclear compartment and initiate transcription. Given these similarities it is intriguing that the DR has been shown to be rapidly down-regulated upon ligand binding (9Pollenz R.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 391-398PubMed Google Scholar, 10Prokipcak R.D. Okey A.B. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1991; 69: 1204-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) whereas HIF1α is rapidly up-regulated during hypoxia (11Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4928) Google Scholar). Such opposing forces in regulating transcription factor levels have several precedents in the literarature (for example; the cytokine-induced phosphorylation and degradation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 1α (12Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) or the mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated stabilization of c-Jun (13Musti A.M. Treier M. Bohmann D. Science. 1997; 275: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar)). In the case of signal transducers and activators of transcription 1α it has been suggested (12Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) that rapid down-regulation is a mechanism of attenuating potentially deleterious extended periods of transcription. Likewise, DR-responsive genes may also require pulsatile rather than continuous expression; however, it is unknown at present why overexpression of the DR-responsive genes so far identified, which are primarily involved in xenobiotic metabolism, would be harmful to the cell. In addition to down-regulation of the DR protein, it has recently been suggested that a DR homologue exerts a repressive effect on DR-mediated transcription via a negative feedback loop (14Mimura J. Ema M. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Thus, there are at least two separate pathways by which DR signaling, once initiated, can be quickly attenuated. Such mechanisms may reflect developmental cues rather than those associated with DR-mediated xenobiotic metabolism. In the cytoplasm the DR is complexed with 2 molecules of HSP90 and other proteins of uncertain function; the immunophilin-related AIP/XAP/ARA9 (15Carver L.A. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11452-11456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 16Carver L.A. LaPres J.J. Jain S. Dunham E.E. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13519-13524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This protein complex is suggested to allow the ligand-binding site of DR to remain correctly folded. Ligand binding is thought to expose an amino-terminal bipartite NLS on the DR such that importin binding and nuclear transport rapidly ensue (7Ikuta T. Eguchi H. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2895-2904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). ARA9 may facilitate one or both of these events although the data supporting this are indirect and based primarily on reporter gene assays (15Carver L.A. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11452-11456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 16Carver L.A. LaPres J.J. Jain S. Dunham E.E. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol.

Concurrently, ligand binding also induces DR depletion in a variety of cell lines (9Pollenz R.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 391-398PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that translocation and depletion may be linked. In general, protein levels can be down-regulated at any stage of their production, ranging from transcriptional to post-translational mechanisms. However, the DR is otherwise stable until the addition of ligand, suggesting that proteolysis is most likely to lead to receptor loss. Because the translocation and depletion of the DR occur simultaneously, it is impossible to separate the interdependence of these two events without the use of recombinant DNA. To address this issue, the DR was tagged with the nucleoplasmic NLS such that it is constitutively nuclear in the absence of ligand. Using this modified DR shows that translocation to the nucleus is necessary for DR proteolysis, with ligand binding and ARNT dimerization having no influence on susceptibility to proteolysis. We have also characterized the pathway of DR proteolysis, which involves ubiquitination and proteasome degradation, preceded by nuclear phosphorylation. A mouse monoclonal antibody (RPT1) specific for the DR was generously supplied by Dr. G. Perdew (Department of Veterinary Science, Pennsylvania State University). 12CA5 (anti-hemagglutinin) antisera was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-ARNT IgG was a gift from Dr. Y. Fujii-Kuriyama (Department of Chemistry, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan). Anti-ubiquitin IgG was obtained from Sigma. MG132 and E-64 were obtained from Biomol and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively. Calyculin was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Nickel affinity-agarose was obtained from Qiagen. Ubiquitin cDNA was a gift from Dr. R. Baker (John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia). Alkaline phosphatase was purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals and reagents were of the highest quality available commercially. Hepa 1c1c7 cells, Hepa1c4 cells, Y1 cells, and 293 T cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Y1 cells stably transfected with DRNLS were grown under the aforementioned conditions and supplemented with 50 μg/ml G418. Transfections were carried out using DOTAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) liposomal transfection medium in 35-mm culture dishes using 1–2 μg of DNA. Experiments were conducted 36 h after transfection. Experiments involving the transfection of ubiquitin mutants used wild type ubiquitin cDNA as a control in the same expression vector. Primers for ubiquitin mutagenesis were 5′TTTGCCGGTAGGCAGCTC3′/5′GAGCTGCCTACCGG-CAAA3′ (to generate UbK48R) and 5′CTAAGAGGTGCTTGAGGTACC3′/5′GGTACCTCAAGCACCTCTTAG3′ (to generate UbK48R/G76A). All ubiquitin constructs were mutated in a pGem7 cassette prior to being subcloned into pCMV5 (20Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all cases polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis was performed using the Quick-change kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All constructs were verified by sequencing. The primers and construction of DRNLS have been described previously (21Lees M. Whitelaw M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar); the NLS consists of the nucleoplasmic NLS (5′KRPAATKKAGQAKKKKR3′) followed by the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope. Briefly, the NLS-HA tag sequence was cloned in frame into an XhoI site on mouse DR cDNA previously generated at the 3′ end of the DR coding region by a polymerase chain reaction (21Lees M. Whitelaw M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar) and followed by a His6tag and a stop codon. When expressed in mammalian cells, the subsequent cDNA encoded DR with the NLS-HA-His6 fusion sequence at its carboxyl terminus (21Lees M. Whitelaw M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of this construct has been shown to be exclusively nuclear in mammalian cells (21Lees M. Whitelaw M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, and whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (21Lees M. Whitelaw M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). When extracts were prepared for analysis of ubiquitin conjugates or phosphorylation, 5 mm n-ethylmaleimide or 5 mm NaF were added to the respective buffers. Nuclear extracts were prepared as follows. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 10% Ficoll-400, 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 150 mm NaCl. After 5 min at 4 °C, extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) was removed, and the pellets were washed once with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline prior to centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20, 400 mm NaCl, 0.1 m EDTA, 10 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm dithiothreitol and mixed for 20 min at 4 °C. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the nuclear supernatant was removed and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation of DRNLS was performed using 12CA5 IgG. Briefly, whole cell extracts (60 μl) were mixed with 5× volumes of a binding buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. 12CA5 IgG was added, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. A 50-μl suspension of Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional hour. The suspension was washed 3 times with 1 ml of binding buffer, and the remaining slurry was boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer prior to immunoblotting. For assays using alkaline phosphatase, 20 μg of whole cell extract was resuspended in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5 and 11 μg of alkaline phosphatase (20 diethanolamine units per assay) in a 50-μl volume. Reactions were conducted at 37 °C and terminated with the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Cells were incubated with the calpain inhibitor E-64 or the proteasome inhibitor MG132 at concentrations of 10 μmand 2.5 μm, respectively. Both chemicals were dissolved in Me2SO and administered to cells 1 h before the commencement of experiments. Calyculin was dissolved in Me2SO and used in cells at a concentration of 50 nm. In all cases controls received vehicle solvent. Nickel affinity purification was performed using the method previously described by Lees and Whitelaw (21Lees M. Whitelaw M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar) with modifications by Aberle et al. (23Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2122) Google Scholar). His6-tagged DRNLS was eluted from the nickel-agarose with 300 mmimidazole in a buffer consisting of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 200 mm NaCl. SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the DRNLS eluate prior to electrophoresis and immunoblotting. When the DR ligand TCDD is administered to murine hepatoma Hepa1c1c7 cells, analysis of whole cell extracts by immunoblotting reveals that the DR is depleted in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A). Preparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts shows that the DR enters the nucleus following TCDD administration (Fig. 1 B). Co-incubation of the cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and TCDD leads to an accumulation of the DR in the nucleus only (Fig. 1 B,lane 6), with the calpain inhibitor E-64 having no effect on DR levels either in the cytoplasmic or nuclear compartments (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and 5). Using a radiolabeled probe containing the xenobiotic response element (XRE; the DNA-binding site of the DR/ARNT heterodimer), a gel shift was performed with extracts from TCDD-treated Hepa1c1c7 cells. When TCDD is added to the cells for 2.5 h, the extracts show a single shifted band corresponding to the DR/ARNT heterodimer (Fig. 1 C,lane 4). This band is intensified severalfold in the presence of MG132 but not E-64 (Fig. 1 C, lanes 5and 6), suggesting that proteasome inhibition increases the amount of DR/ARNT heterodimer available for DNA binding. Because an increase in DNA binding could conceivably result from elevated ARNT or DR, MG132 and E-64 were added to Hepa1c1c7 cells for 2.5 h, and levels of ARNT were determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 1 D). Neither protease inhibitor had any effect on ARNT concentrations either in the presence or absence of TCDD, suggesting that the increase observed in the gel shift resulted primarily from stabilization of DR by MG132. In Hepa1c1c7 cells the depletion of the DR and its subsequent stabilization by MG132 depends upon the addition of ligand. Therefore, the proteolysis of the DR could be initiated by (i) translocation to the nucleus, (ii) formation of a heterodimer with ARNT in the nucleus, or (iii) conformational changes induced by ligand. We attempted to address each of these possibilities experimentally using a combination of methods. In mutant Hepa1c4 cells, DR is expressed at similar levels to Hepa1c1c7 cells; however, levels of the partner factor ARNT are virtually undetectable (24Hoffman E.C. Reyes H. Chu F.F. Sander F. Conley L.H. Brooks B.A. Hankinson O. Science. 1991; 252: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Using identical conditions to those described in Fig. 1 A, addition of TCDD to Hepa1c4 cells resulted in the rapid depletion of DR (Fig. 2 A). When cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared, DR translocated to the nucleus where it could only be visualized by the addition of MG132 (Fig. 2 B,lane 6). Because of the absence of nuclear ARNT in these cells, there is some DR leakage out of the nuclear compartment during extract preparation, accounting for the DR present in the cytoplasmic fraction following the addition of TCDD and MG132. The data from Fig. 2suggest that the ligand-induced depletion of the DR is not triggered by dimerization with its partner factor ARNT. Because dimerization with ARNT in the nuclear compartment does not appear to initiate DR proteolysis, the role of nuclear translocation per se was investigated using recombinant DNA (Fig. 3). We decided to completely bypass ligand-induced nuclear translocation of the DR to determine the nuclear stability of the DR in both the absence and presence of ligand. Ligand binding could conceivably alter the structure of the latent DR complex such that it can be formatted for nuclear proteolysis, even though this is clearly not the case in the cytoplasmic compartment (Fig. 3). The carboxyl terminus of the DR was modified by the addition of the nucleoplasmic NLS followed by an additional epitope recognized by anti-hemagglutinin IgG and a hexahistidine tag (His6, 21). We have previously generated a derivative cell line from Y1 murine adrenal cells that stably expresses this DRNLS construct. From these cells, DRNLS has been shown to be exclusively nuclear while remaining in a latent HSP90 bound complex (21Lees M. Whitelaw M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of DRNLS from Y1/DRNLS cells using anti-HA IgG reveals that its dimerization with ARNT is contingent upon the addition of ligand (Fig. 3 A). Without ligand, DRNLS has been shown to be complexed with HSP90 (21Lees M. Whitelaw M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar), thus the relative stability of the HSP90/DR·ARNT/DR complexes can be directly assessed in the nucleus. When cells were treated with cycloheximide and immunoblotted in the presence or absence of ligand, DRNLS was shown in both cases to be an unstable protein with a half-life of ≤1 h (Fig. 3 B). Ligand binding and the subsequent shift in DRNLS partner proteins from HSP90 to ARNT is therefore suggested to have little effect on DR stability in the nucleus. When Y1/DRNLS cells were incubated with MG132, DRNLS accumulated whether complexed with HSP90 or ARNT (Fig. 3 C,lane 3). The calpain inhibitor E-64 had no effect in either case (Fig. 3 C, lane 2), suggesting that DRNLS is rapidly degraded by a proteasome-mediated pathway. Transient co-expression of DRNLS with or without ARNT in human embryonic kidney 293 T cells also failed to display any ligand-dependent changes in DRNLS levels (Fig. 3 D). Thus it appears that DRNLS stability is determined independently of the concentration of its partner proteins. Ubiquitin conjugation is a common mechanism by which transcription factor levels are targeted for destruction. Because ubiquitin conjugation precedes 26 S proteasome degradation, chemical inhibitors of the proteasome do not distinguish between ubiquitin-mediated or proteasome-mediated degradation of a protein (although examples of the latter are rare and usually reserved for damaged proteins). When incubating Y1/DRNLS cells or Hepa1c1c7/c4 cells with MG132 we were unable to visualize DR-ubiquitin conjugates as laddering on anti-HA immunoblots; however, the detection of such conjugates often varies, and as such, an alternative method was used to verify a role for ubiquitination in DR proteolysis. A ubiquitin construct with a lysine to arginine mutation at amino acid 48, a principal acceptor residue for further ubiquitin monomers, was utilized. Expression of UbK48R in eukaryotic cells acts as a dominant negative mutation (25Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar, 26Finley D. Sadis S. Monia B.P. Boucher P. Ecker D.J. Crooke S.T. Chau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5501-5509Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) by inhibiting ubiquitin chain formation, thereby preventing the multiubiquitination of a target protein and its subsequent recognition and proteolysis by the 26 S proteasome. Co-expression of UbK48R with DRNLS in 293 T cells results in an increase in DRNLS levels when compared with transfection with wild type Ub (Fig. 4 A, comparelanes 1 and 2). We attempted to “trap” monoubiquitinated DRNLS by creating another mutation at the carboxyl-terminal glycine of UbK48R (UbK48R/G76A). A glycine to alanine mutation at this residue has been demonstrated to inhibit ubiquitin isopeptidases (27Hodgins R.R. Ellison K.S. Ellison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8807-8812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wilkinson K.D. Tashayev V.L. O'Connor L.B. Larsen C.N. Kasperek E. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14535-14546Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), thus we reasoned that co-transfection with this double mutant would enhance our ability to detect DRNLS-Ub. Although we were still able to effectively inhibit DRNLS proteolysis with this construct (Fig. 4 A, lane 5), no DRNLS-ubiquitin conjugate(s) were identified, suggesting that the levels of DRNLS-Ub conjugates are very low and/or unstable under these experimental conditions. When UbK48R was co-expressed with DRNLS and ARNT, no changes were observed in ARNT levels as determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, the levels of DR but not ARNT are suggested to be regulated by ubiquitination. In Fig. 4 C the effect of UbK48R on DRNLS-signaling was determined in a gene reporter assay. Co-transfection of UbK48R with DRNLS significantly increased DRNLS-mediated reporter activity as compared with DRNLS alone. Overall, the simplest interpretation of the results presented in Fig. 4 is that the nuclear DR is rapidly degraded by ubiquitination that is either complexed with HSP90 or ARNT. In an effort to determine the mechanism responsible for rapid nuclear proteolysis of the DR we investigated the potential role of phosphorylation. Several transcription factors couple phosphorylation to ubiquitination as an effective trigger for their proteolysis (see Refs. 13Musti A.M. Treier M. Bohmann D. Science. 1997; 275: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 29Song A. Wang Q. Goebl M.G. Harrington M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4994-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, and 30Tsurumi C. Ishida N. Tamura T. Kakizuka A. Nishida E. Okumura E. Kishimoto T. Inagaki M. Okazaki K. Sagata N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5682-5687Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar for examples). Thus, in the absence of any obvious structural destabilization caused by ligand binding, it seemed logical that the DR may also be phosphorylated prior to its degradation. When the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin was added to Y1 cells expressing DRNLS, a time-dependent shift in the migration of DRNLS was observed by immunoblotting (Fig. 5 A), most notably after incubation for 1 h. We interpreted the slower migrating of these 2 bands to represent a phosphorylated form of DRNLS. When calyculin-treated extracts were split into separate aliquots and treated with alkaline phosphatase, the doublet was resolved to a single band after 25 min (Fig. 5 B), confirming the presence of phosphorylated DRNLS. When DRNLS cells were treated with calyculin and MG132 in the presence or absence of ligand (Fig. 5 C) it was apparent that DRNLS was phosphorylated to the same extent whether partnered by HSP90 or ARNT (Fig. 5 C, compare lanes 2 and 3). Moreover, when the immunoblots were exposed for longer time periods, several more bands from calyculin-treated cells were evident at higher molecular mass with an accrual of immunoreactive material at a molecular mass range of >200 kDa. Importantly, in the same cell line deficient for DRNLS, no immunoreactivity was observed (lane 4), suggesting that the staining consists of DRNLS and covalently bound derivatives thereof. These results are consistent with phosphorylation-induced ubiquitination of the DRNLS protein. To verify that this staining represented DRNLS-ubiquitin conjugates, we purified the His6-tagged DRNLS receptor from Y1 cells on a nickel affinity column and counter-stained with anti-ubiquitin IgG (Fig. 5 D). In extracts from the control cell line, nickel affinity purification showed no immunoreactive material with either anti-HA or anti-ubiquitin IgG in the presence of MG132 and calyculin (Fig. 5 D, lane 1). Nickel affinity purification of DRNLS from Y1 cells incubated with MG132 showed minimal staining with anti-ubiquitin IgG, indicative of the very low levels of DR-ubiquitin conjugates normally found within cells (Fig. 5 D, lane 2). However, when Y1/DRNLS cells were incubated with MG132 and calyculin, a considerable increase was observed in ubiquitin conjugates compared with MG132 alone (Fig. 5 D, lanes 2 and3). Therefore, the collective data presented in Fig. 5suggest that calyculin treatment results in the phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination of DRNLS. Compartmentalizing transcription factors is a major strategy used by the cell to confer control of activity or spatial proximity to physiological signals (for review see Ref. 31Ptashne M. Gann A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 812-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Over the past few years it has become clear that many nuclear proteins contain specific amino acid nuclear localization sequences that confer their subcellular distribution. In several transcription factors this sequence is “masked” until an appropriate signal exposes it, allowing binding to importin-α and transport through the nuclear pore (for review see Refs. 32Cole C.N.

The DR is one such factor that, in response to cognate ligands, is rapidly translocated to the nucleus and concomitantly depleted from the cell. The NLS of the DR is relatively well characterized and consists of a bipartite cluster of basic amino acids with a mutation-insensitive region between the cluster (7Ikuta T. Eguchi H. Tachibana T.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) both possess similar NLS sequences to the DR in their amino termini; however, in the case of HIF1α an additional hypoxia-sensitive NLS has recently been shown to control its nuclear translocation (8Kallio P.J. Okamoto K. O'Brien S. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we show that when the DR is sent directly to the nucleus, bypassing ligand-induced exposure of its NLS, it is rapidly degraded in the presence or absence of ligand. Therefore, in a proteolytic context, ligand binding acts only in transporting the DR to the site of degradation (Fig. 3). Although ARNT may potentially play a role in regulating HIF1α levels, the results from this study suggest that it does not influence the stability of the DR. The DR is rapidly depleted in both ARNT-containing Hepa1c1c7 cells or ARNT-deficient Hepa1c4 cells (Figs. 1 and 2), suggesting that DR dimerization with ARNT, although essential to transcriptional activity, is not a prerequisite for proteolysis. This finding was in accordance with results obtained using the constitutively nuclear receptor DRNLS, which was demonstrated to be unstable when complexed either with HSP90 or ARNT (Fig. 3 B). In all cases, ligand-translocated DR or DRNLS could be stabilized in the nuclear compartment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (FIG. 1, FIG. 2, FIG. 3), suggesting that a common nuclear mechanism accounts for DR proteolysis. Ubiquitination has been demonstrated to down-regulate the bHLH transcription factors HIF1α (37Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Both proteins are involved in development and may be required to rapidly switch target genes on and off. Likewise, control of DR levels may also be important in development and as such may require rapid down-regulation. At present, gene disruption studies have not defined a clear role for the DR in development; however, there are deficiencies in growth and liver size and reduced fertility (see Ref. 41Lahvis G.P. Bradfield C.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the present study we show that co-expression of DRNLS with UbK48R results in stabilization of DRNLS (Fig. 4), suggesting that ubiquitination is a major mechanism for rapidly removing the DR. Under these conditions, levels of the DR partner protein ARNT are not affected by UbK48R, thus we consider the rapid degradation of the DR/ARNT heterodimer to involve DR only (Fig. 4 B). An additional level of negative control has been recently identified by Mimura et al. (14Mimura J. Ema M. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), who showed that the DR is able to switch on the synthesis of a repressor protein AHRR, which binds to target DR XRE elements, thus starting a negative feedback loop. In our reporter assays, UbK48R did not increase activity by the amount predicted from its effects on DR levels (Fig. 4 C). It is conceivable that without UbK48R the reporter activity is already close to maximal with respect to the transcriptionally active DR/ARNT heterodimer. Alternatively, expression of AHRR may limit the extent to which high levels of DR can stimulate transcription. Phosphorylation is well established to elicit the structural changes required for ubiquitination. In the case of inhibitor of κB transcription factor α, the kinase and ubiquitin ligating enzyme may be part of the same protein complex (42Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis M. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar); however, the relationship between the kinase and the ubiquitin protein isopeptide ligase is less defined for other transcription factors. We show that co-incubation of DRNLS with MG132 and the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin causes the accumulation of a phosphorylated form of DRNLS (Fig. 5). Concurrently, a build-up of high M r DRNLS-Ub occurs (Fig. 5,C and D), suggesting that phosphorylation of DRNLS leads to ubiquitination. This process occurs whether HSP90 or ARNT is complexed with DRNLS, suggesting that this phosphorylation is a nuclear event that occurs irrespective of the structural differences between these two complexes. The exact location of the phosphorylation site(s) and the nature of the kinase/ubiquitin protein isopeptide ligase responsible for DR proteolysis are the subject of further investigation.

Interestingly, the primary structure of Ctr4 and a putative human high affinity copper transport protein, hCtr1, suggests that they are derived from a fusion of the functionally redundant but structurally distinct Ctr1 and Ctr3 copper transporters from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Furthermore, although Cuf1 activates ctr4 + gene expression under copper starvation conditions, under these same conditions Cuf1 directly represses expression of genes encoding components of the iron transport machinery. These studies have identified an evolutionary step in which copper transport modules have been fused, and describe a mechanism by which a copper-sensing factor directly represses expression of the iron uptake genes under conditions in which the essential copper co-factor is scarce.

Copper and iron are two metal ions that are essential for the growth of all organisms, serving as redox active co-factors for a wide variety of cellular enzymes including mitochondrial cytochromes, multi-copper ferroxidases, and superoxide dismutases (1Eide D.J.

Furthermore, as a consequence of chemical reactions between copper or iron and oxygen, these same metals generate reactive oxygen species that damage nucleic acids, proteins and membranes (5Santoro N. Thiele D.J. Hohmann S. Mager W.H. Yeast Stress Responses. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1997: 171-211Google Scholar). When copper and iron accumulate in excess or are abnormally mobilized, a number of disease states are manifest such as Menkes and Wilson diseases and anemia, disorders of copper and iron acquisition, respectively, and hemochromatosis, an iron overload condition that is one of the most common inherited disorders affecting people of Northern European genealogy (6Askwith C.

Therefore, it is critical for cells to maintain sufficient levels of copper and iron to carry out essential biochemical reactions, but regulatory mechanisms must be in place to prevent these metals from accumulating in excess.The bakers' yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is an excellent model system to understand the function and regulation of fundamental mechanisms for copper and iron uptake and distribution in eukaryotic cells. Biochemical and genetic experiments have shown that copper and iron ions are reduced by cell surface Fe3+/Cu2+ reductases, encoded by theFRE genes (10Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J.

The Ctr1 and Ctr3 proteins are functionally redundant; while cells expressing either Ctr1 or Ctr3 are fully competent for high affinity copper transport,ctr1Δ ctr3Δ cells exhibit copper starvation phenotypes including the inability to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources, lack of measurable high affinity iron uptake activity, and defective copper/zinc SOD activity (14Dancis A.

Interestingly, Ctr1 and Ctr3 are structurally distinct proteins, with Ctr1 harboring several potential copper binding motifs (M-X 2-M-X-M) in the amino-terminal extracellular domain while Ctr3 lacks these motifs, but has an abundance of cysteine residues throughout the protein.

This regulation involves cis-acting copper-responsive elements (CuREs),1 found in each of these promoters, with the consensus sequence 5′-TTTGC(T/G)C(A/G)-3′, and a copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1 (13Martins L.J.

In vivo footprinting has demonstrated that Mac1 is bound to CuRE elements under conditions of copper scarcity and is not bound under conditions of copper sufficiency (28Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J.

Furthermore, Mac1 undergoes copper-responsive intra-molecular interactions that modulate trans-activation function (31Jensen L.T. Winge D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5400-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Mac1 has homology with the amino-terminal 40 amino acids of the minor groove DNA binding domain found in the Ace1/Amt1 copper-activated DNA-binding proteins that activate metallothionein gene expression, but little homology outside of this region (32Jungmann J.

In the Mac1 carboxyl-terminal region reside two cysteine-rich repeats, REP-I and REP-II, that have been demonstrated to function in copper sensing (34Graden J.A. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The MAC1up1 allele, one of several dominant alleles with mutations in REP-I, encodes a protein unable to sense copper and, as a consequence, is constitutively bound to CuREs and strongly constitutively activates expression of CTR1,CTR3, and FRE1/7 (13Martins L.J.

Like genes involved in copper transport, FET3, FTR1, and many other iron homeostatic genes are regulated as a function of iron availability through conserved cis-acting promoter elements by the Aft1 iron-sensing transcription factor (36Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 37Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Indeed, the interdependence of the iron uptake pathway on copper availability is also underscored by the observations that FRE1 is regulated by copper and iron and the ATX1 and CCC2 genes, encoding copper trafficking proteins, are regulated by iron and Aft1, but not copper (10Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 16Lin S.-J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A.

For example, S. pombe utilizes pathways involved in stress-responsive signal transduction that are conserved in humans but not in S. cerevisiae (38Shiozaki K. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 39Wilkinson M.G. Samuels M. Takeda T. Toone W.M. Shieh J.C. Toda T. Millar J.B. Jones N.

Fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe: an attractive host for heterologous protein production. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1997: 3-28Google Scholar). Moreover, little is known about trace metal ion homeostasis in fission yeast. In S. pombe three components involved in the high affinity iron uptake system have been identified. Frp1, which shares amino acid sequence similarity with the Fre reductases from S. cerevisiae and the mammalian gp91 phox subunit of cytochromeb 558, is required at the cell surface to reduce Fe3+ (41Roman D.G. Dancis A. Anderson G.J. Klausner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4342-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 42Anderson G.J. Dancis A. Roman D.G. Klausner R.D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 356: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Once reduced, Fe2+ is taken up by a permease/oxidase complex, Fip1/Fio1, and transported into the cell, as occurs with the orthologous Fet3/Ftr1 complex in S. cerevisiae (43Askwith C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 401-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the structure and regulation of proteins involved in copper homeostasis, we have identified S. pombe genes encoding a copper-responsive transcription factor and a high affinity copper transporter. Interestingly, the S. pombe Cuf1 copper-sensing transcription factor is composed of modules from both the Mac1 and Ace1/Amt1 families of copper metalloregulatory transcription factors (44Koch K.A. Peña M.M.O. Thiele D.J. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 549-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 45Winge D.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 165-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Likewise, the S. pombe high affinity copper transporter, Ctr4, has no functionally redundant counterpart and resembles a fused version of the S. cerevisiae Ctr1 and Ctr3 copper transport proteins. Surprisingly, we show that the Cuf1 protein, which normally serves to activate expression of thectr4 + gene under conditions of copper scarcity, directly represses the expression of iron transport genes under the same conditions. These studies in S. pombe provide insight into the evolution of copper transport protein structure in eukaryotes and into the mechanisms by which cells couple copper availability with the expression of a functional iron transport complex.DISCUSSIONOur results in S. pombe have provided important information on the structural modularity of both copper ion-sensing transcription factors and copper ion transporters. Indeed, our studies clearly demonstrate that Cuf1 is functionally similar to Mac1 fromS. cerevisiae in terms of its regulation of copper transporter gene expression and repression of iron transport genes. However, structurally Cuf1 has hallmarks of the Ace1/Amt1 proteins at its amino terminus that extend beyond the similarity observed between Mac1 and the Ace1/Amt1 amino-terminal DNA binding domains. This similarity is further supported by the observations that Cuf1 will partially suppress an ace1Δ mutation, but not when the major target gene of Ace1, CUP1-encoded metallothionein, is deleted. Furthermore, in ace1Δ cells expressing Cuf1, the robust basal levels of CUP1 mRNA are repressed approximately 3-fold in response to copper, consistent with the manner by which Cuf1 regulates ctr4 + gene expression inS. pombe and the plausibility that Cuf1 directly binds to the CUP1 promoter.2 The possibility that the unique amino terminus of Cuf1 displays distinct DNA binding specificity from that of Mac1 is supported by the fact that the Cuf1 binding sites identified in thefio1 + -fip1 + promoter region (5′-TTTGTC-3′) differ from the CuRE element consensus sequence found in the CTR1, CTR3, FRE1, andFRE7 genes in S. cerevisiae(5′-TTTGC(T/G)C(A/G)-3′). Therefore, the network of hydrogen bonds made by the conserved Cuf1 amino-terminal minor groove DNA binding domain and the T-rich DNA sequence, while likely similar to those made by Mac1 and Ace1/Amt1, are likely to be highly specific for each protein within the more G-C rich core of their respective cis-acting DNA sequences. We also note that we have shown Cuf1 DNA binding in cell extracts to be responsive to copper levels, a feature associated with Ace1 and Amt1 in cell extracts, but one that has only been demonstrated for Mac1 in vivo (28Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

Because a specific mutation of the first repeated element in Mac1 (MAC1 up1) generates a protein that is unable to repress target gene expression in response to copper, this element likely serves a copper-sensing function to homeostatically modulate expression of the ctr4 + gene, and perhaps other genes, by Cuf1. Taken together, S. pombe has utilized copper-sensing domains from two distinct classes of copper metalloregulatory transcription factors for Cuf1, creating a chimeric protein from the phylogenetic standpoint.The S. pombe Ctr4 protein appears to be a chimera of theS. cerevisiae Ctr1 and Ctr3 high affinity copper transport proteins. This is supported by the observation that the Ctr4 amino terminus harbors five copies of a putative extracellular copper binding domain (M-X 2-M-X-M) that is found in the amino termini of both S. cerevisiae and human Ctr1, but not in S. cerevisiae Ctr3. Furthermore, the carboxyl-terminal ∼65% of Ctr4 has strong identity to Ctr3, especially within the transmembrane spanning domains, but little identity to Ctr1 in this segment. Since the transmembrane domains are likely to play crucial roles in guiding copper across the plasma membrane, this homology to Ctr3 may be very important in copper transport. Indeed, the analysis of human Ctr1, by domain structure, sequence identity, and phylogenetic tree formation using the Clustal method, demonstrates that like Ctr4, the human Ctr1 protein has homology to S. cerevisiae Ctr1 in the amino terminus (29%) and Ctr3 in the carboxyl terminus (31%) (Fig. 4 A). Furthermore, hCtr1 is more closely related to S. cerevisiaeCtr3 over the entire length of the protein, than it is to Ctr1. Based on these structural features of Ctr4, we speculate that S. pombe may represent an early evolutionary phase at which the Ctr1 and Ctr3 proteins, encoded by distinct and functionally redundant genes in S. cerevisiae, may have fused into one protein. This idea is supported by our observation that, unlike the functionally redundant situation in S. cerevisiae with Ctr1 and Ctr3, deletion of the S. pombe ctr4 + gene (ctr4Δ) is sufficient to confer a copper starvation phenotype. This would predict that inactivation of the mouse homologue of Ctr1, if a single copy gene, would be likely to generate a copper deficiency.It has been well established that iron uptake and mobilization in mammals is tightly linked to copper availability (65Kaplan J. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1996; 271: 1510-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 66Winzerling J.J. Law J.H. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 501-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Indeed, swine suffering from copper malnutrition exhibit several abnormalities in iron metabolism including the inability to absorb, mobilize, and utilize administered iron, and were diagnosed in an early study as anemic (67Gubler C.J.

Invest. 1968; 47: 2058-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Moreover, failure to incorporate copper ions into the copper-containing ferroxidase ceruloplasmin gives rise in an unstable protein and a loss of the ferroxidase activity, which is essential for iron mobilization (69Harris Z.L. Gitlin J.D. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1996; 63: 836S-841SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study has revealed the existence of a putative copper-dependent ferroxidase, hephaestin, which would transfer iron from the intestinal mucosal cells through the baso-lateral membrane into the blood stream in concert with other component(s), such as a putative iron transporter (9Vulpe C.D. Kuo Y.M. Murphy T.L. Cowley L. Askwith C. Libina N. Gitschier J. Anderson G.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). The requirement for copper in iron transport has also been biochemically characterized in some mammalian cell lines (70Yu J. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6909-6915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recent studies inS. cerevisiae have uncovered the mechanisms that underlie this dependence, through the isolation and analysis of genes encoding high affinity copper transporters (Ctr1 and Ctr3), the intracellular copper chaperone Atx1, a TGN localized P-type ATPase copper pump (Ccc2), a chloride channel that facilitates copper loading onto Fet3 (Gef1) (71Greene J.R.

The high affinity copper transporters are essential to mediate the passage of copper ions across the plasma membrane, with mobilization of copper to the Ccc2 P-type ATPase by the Atx1 copper chaperone, whereby it is delivered to the lumen of the secretory compartment through the action of Ccc2. Within the late secretory pathway, four copper atoms are assembled with Fet3 (74De Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Eide D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1098-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 75Hassett R.F. Yuan D.S. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23274-23282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with the assistance of the Gef1 chloride channel. The failure to incorporate copper into Fet3 is thought to lead to a misfolded and enzymatically inactive ferroxidase, which prevents the Fet3-Ftr1 high affinity iron transport complex from assembling at the plasma membrane, resulting in iron deficiency. Therefore, it is clear that copper must be provided for the iron transport/mobilization machinery to function. Previously, it was established that the ATX1 copper chaperone gene is regulated by intracellular iron availability by the Aft1 iron sensor. In this work, we have demonstrated that at least three genes involved in iron uptake in S. pombe, and the FET3 gene in S. cerevisiae, are transcriptionally regulated by the copper-sensing transcription factors Cuf1 and Mac1, respectively. Our data support a direct role for Cuf1 in repression of these genes since either inactivation of the cuf1 + gene, or mutation of Cuf1 binding sites in thefio1 +-fip1 + promoter region, gave a marked de-repression of thefio1 +-fip1 + gene expression. We suggest based on these data and on in vitroDNA binding experiments, that Cuf1 repressesfrp1 +, fio1 +,fip1 +, and possibly other genes involved in iron uptake/mobilization, under conditions of copper scarcity, by binding to TTTGTC elements with their respective promoters. When copper is present at higher levels, Cuf1 de-represses gene expression through copper-sensing mechanisms that inactivate DNA binding and perhaps via other intramolecular conformational changes. This model is consistent with the demonstrated copper-responsive DNA binding of Cuf1 in vitro and Mac1 in vivo (28Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and the marked repression of FET3 expression by the S. cerevisiaeMac1up1 protein, known to bind DNA in vivo even in the presence of copper. Since the iron uptake genes are inducibly expressed in response to the iron chelator BPS, even under conditions of copper scarcity, we speculate that there may be functional interactions between the copper- and iron-sensing transcription factors. Further studies will elucidate how Cuf1 and Mac1 repress expression of the iron uptake genes and how these copper-responsive transcription factors may interact with iron-sensing transcription factors.The regulation of iron uptake genes in both S. cerevisiaeand S. pombe by copper-sensing transcription factors provides a means of tightly coordinating and fine tuning iron transport with respect to copper availability. Since the Fet3 multi-copper ferroxidase is a key component of the high affinity iron transport complex at the plasma membrane, futile expression of the iron transport genes, in the absence of sufficient concentrations of the copper co-factor, would be undesirable. Yeast cells have therefore evolved both repressive and activator functions for copper-sensing transcription factors to maintain the delicate balance of these two essential, yet toxic metal ions. The mechanisms by which organisms accumulate, sense and respond to nutrients is a critical aspect of cellular growth control. Copper and iron are two metal ions that are essential for the growth of all organisms, serving as redox active co-factors for a wide variety of cellular enzymes including mitochondrial cytochromes, multi-copper ferroxidases, and superoxide dismutases (1Eide D.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 2Andrews N.C. Fleming M.D. Gunshin H. Nutr.

Furthermore, as a consequence of chemical reactions between copper or iron and oxygen, these same metals generate reactive oxygen species that damage nucleic acids, proteins and membranes (5Santoro N. Thiele D.J. Hohmann S. Mager W.H. Yeast Stress Responses. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1997: 171-211Google Scholar). When copper and iron accumulate in excess or are abnormally mobilized, a number of disease states are manifest such as Menkes and Wilson diseases and anemia, disorders of copper and iron acquisition, respectively, and hemochromatosis, an iron overload condition that is one of the most common inherited disorders affecting people of Northern European genealogy (6Askwith C.

We demonstrate here that platelets adhering to immobilized vWf under flow conditions undergo rapid morphological conversion from flat discs to spiny spheres during surface translocation. Studies of Glanzmann thrombasthenic platelets (lacking integrin αIIbβ3) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with GPIb/IX (CHO-Ib/IX) confirmed that vWf binding to GPIb/IX was sufficient to induce actin polymerization and cytoskeletal reorganization independent of integrin αIIbβ3. vWf-induced cytoskeletal reorganization occurred independently of several well characterized signaling processes linked to platelet activation, including calcium influx, prostaglandin metabolism, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, activation of protein kinase C or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase but was critically dependent on the mobilization of intracellular calcium.

The first step in the hemostatic process involves the binding of the platelet adhesion receptor, GPIb/V/IX, to the vascular adhesive protein, vWf.1 Under conditions of rapid blood flow this receptor-ligand interaction is indispensable for tethering platelets to the injured vessel wall as a prerequisite step for integrin-mediated cell arrest (1Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 2Savage B. Almus-Jacobs F. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). This multi-step adhesion mechanism is remarkably similar to that utilized by leukocytes to adhere to post-capillary venules in vivo. Rolling of leukocytes is mediated by one or more selectin family members, whereas irreversible cell adhesion requires activation of β2 integrins (3Lawrence M.B. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 859-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar, 4Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6414) Google Scholar). vWf is a unique adhesive ligand in that it has the ability to support both the initial transient phase of platelet adhesion as well as integrin αIIbβ3-mediated cell arrest. The A1 domain of vWf contains the binding site for GPIbα, whereas the C1 domain peptide sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) binds integrin αIIbβ3 (platelet GPIIb/IIIa) (5Ruggeri Z.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 898-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Bond formation between vWf and GPIb is rapid, reversible, and inherently resistant to detachment by high shear forces. This latter property of the vWf-GPIb interaction is essential for sustaining platelet tethering under high shear, presumably as a consequence of the multivalency of the vWf-GPIb interaction (6Ruggeri Z.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) as well as anchorage of the receptor complex to the membrane skeleton (7Cranmer S.L. Ulsemer P. Cooke B.M. Salem H.H. de la Salle C. Lanza F. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6097-6106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). There is growing evidence that GPIb/V/IX not only mediates platelet adhesion but also transduces signals required for platelet activation (8Kroll M.H. Harris T.S. Moake J.L. Handin R.I. Schafer A. I. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1568-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). One of these activation events involves the conversion of integrin αIIbβ3 from a low affinity to a high affinity receptor (9De Marco L. Girolami A. Russell S. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1198-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 10Gralnick H.R. Williams S.B. Coller B.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 19-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction between activated integrin αIIbβ3 and vWf is characterized by a slow dissociation rate that supports irreversible platelet adhesion and stable platelet aggregation (1Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 9De Marco L. Girolami A. Russell S. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Clin.

These adhesive interactions are physiologically important as evidenced by the severe bleeding disorders experienced by individuals with congenital deficiencies of vWf, GPIb/V/IX, or integrin αIIbβ3. In addition to supporting irreversible platelet adhesion, vWf binding to platelets induces dramatic cytoskeletal reorganization transforming resting disc-shaped platelets to fully spread forms (11Savage B. Shattil S.J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11300-11306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yuan Y. Dopheide S.M. Ivanidis C. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21847-21854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The physiological importance of vWf in promoting cytoskeletal reorganization has been highlighted by in vivo experiments on pigs with von Willebrand disease (vWD) (13Reddick R.L. Griggs T.R. Lamb M.A. Brinkhous K.M. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5076-5079Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In these studies, platelet adhesion to injured coronary arteries of normal pigs was associated with platelet filopodial extension and cell spreading. In contrast, platelets from vWD pigs extended few filopodia and failed to spread following adhesion to the subendothelium, indicating that cytoskeletal reorganization of adherent platelets in vivo is primarily a vWf-dependent process. Despite the potential importance of vWf-induced cytoskeletal reorganization, the molecular basis for this phenomenon has been poorly defined. Studies of human platelets congenitally deficient in integrin αIIbβ3 (Glanzmann thrombasthenia) have demonstrated an important role for this receptor in inducing platelet spreading at sites of vessel wall injury (14Weiss H.J. Turitto V.T. Baumgartner H.R. Blood. 1986; 67: 322-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sakariassen K.S. Nievelstein P.F.E.M. Coller B.S. Sixma J.J. Br. J. Haematol. 1986; 63: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The role of the vWf-GPIb/V/IX interaction in inducing cytoskeletal reorganization is less clear. A previous study by Cunningham et al. (16Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that the vWf-GPIb/IX interaction can induce pseudopodial extension and cell spreading in GPIb/IX-transfected CHO cells, although a follow-up study by the same group has suggested that these cytoskeletal changes require activation of endogenous CHO cell integrins (17Meyer S.C. Lowry B.R. Fox J.E.B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; (suppl.): 167Google Scholar). The ability of the vWf-GPIb interaction to induce cytoskeletal reorganization and shape change is a potentially important issue. Other rolling receptors, such as the selectins, do not induce cytoskeletal reorganization during the rolling process (3Lawrence M.B. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 859-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). This is not surprising given that the spherical shape of resting leukocytes is ideally suited for a rolling-type adhesion and that morphological change in these cells reduces their ability to adhere under flow (3Lawrence M.B. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 859-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). Circulating platelets, however, exhibit a flat discoid morphology, well suited for efficient cell transport through the microvasculature but less ideal for cell rolling. In this study we have examined the possibility that the vWf-GPIb/V/IX interaction not only mediates platelet rolling but also transduces signals leading to cytoskeletal reorganization during the rolling process. We demonstrate that platelets tethering to a vWf matrix under flow undergo dramatic cytoskeletal reorganization, leading to platelet sphering and filopodial extension. These morphological changes were also observed in Glanzmann thrombasthenic platelets and GPIb/IX-transfected cells demonstrating that these cytoskeletal changes occur independently of integrin αIIbβ3. The ability of the vWf-GPIb interaction to induce these cytoskeletal changes did not require calcium influx, activation of PKC, PI 3-kinase, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, or prostaglandin metabolism but was critically dependent on the mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores. DNA, DNase I, FITC-conjugated phalloidin, Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) peptide, wortmannin, and cytochalasin D were purchased from Sigma.

Anti-αIIbβ3 chimeric Fab fragment of mAb 7E3 (c7E3 Fab-abciximab) was from Eli Lilly (Centocor, Leiden, Netherlands). All other materials were from sources we have described previously (12Yuan Y.

Washed platelets were prepared and finally resuspended in Tyrode's buffer (10 mm Hepes, 12 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm glucose) as described previously (12Yuan Y.

Washed platelets (3 × 108/ml) were aggregated with the indicated concentration of HvWf in the presence of 1 mg/ml ristocetin or with BvWf alone. Aggregation was initiated by stirring the reaction mixture at 920 rpm, 37 °C, in a four-channel automated platelet analyzer (Kyoto Daiichi, Japan). In some studies, platelets were preincubated for 10 min with either EDTA (2 mm), RGDS peptide (1 mm), or the anti-αIIbβ3 c7E3 Fab (20 μg/ml) to block ligand binding to αIIbβ3. vWf binding to GPIb was blocked by pretreating platelets with the anti-GPIbα mAb, AK2 (5 μg/ml). Calcium influx was prevented by resuspending platelets in Tyrode's buffer containing EDTA (2 mm) or EGTA (2 mm). In other studies, platelets were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with inhibitors of PI 3-kinase (wortmannin (100 nm) or LY294002 (10 μm)), PKC (calphostin (1 μm) or bisindolylmaleimide (200 nm)), or protein tyrosine kinases (genistein (100 μm), tyrphostin (200 μm), or erbstatin (25 μg/ml)). The prostaglandin pathway was inhibited by pretreating platelets with aspirin (1 mm) for 90 min at 37 °C or by donor ingestion of 300 mg of aspirin per day for 3 consecutive days before blood collection. In each case the pharmacological activity of the inhibitors was confirmed as follows. Wortmannin and LY294002 caused dose-dependent inhibition of thrombin-stimulated production of phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate; genistein, tyrphostin, or erbstatin completely inhibited vWf-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation; calphostin or bisindolylmaleimide abolished PAC-1 binding to washed platelets adherent to a vWf matrix; aspirin abolished arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation; RGDS and c7E3 Fab blocked ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Resuspending platelets in EDTA-containing buffers abolished calpain activation in thrombin-stimulated platelets. Platelet adhesion under flow was performed using a modified method of Cranmer et al. (7Cranmer S.L. Ulsemer P. Cooke B.M. Salem H.H. de la Salle C. Lanza F. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6097-6106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Microslides (flat, rectangular microcapillary tubes) were coated with HvWf (100 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. For flow studies using citrated whole blood, the microcapillary tubes were left unblocked; however, for washed platelet studies the vWf-coated tubes were blocked with either 25% heat-inactivated human serum (containing 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) or 1% bovine serum albumin for 60 min. In general, the results were similar with either blocking method although there was less nonspecific adhesion on the serum-blocked vWf matrices. For whole blood studies, platelets were fluorescently labeled by incubating citrate anti-coagulated blood with DiOC6 (1 μm) for 10 min. The labeled whole blood was perfused through the vWf-coated microcapillary tubes at a shear rate of 150 or 750 s−1, and the non-adherent blood cells were removed by perfusing Tyrode's buffer. c7E3 Fab (20 μg/ml) was present throughout the experiments to prevent irreversible platelet adhesion. For washed platelet flow studies, cells were washed twice in platelet washing buffer, pH 6.5, containing the platelet activation inhibitors, PGE1 (200 ng/ml), and theophylline (10 mm). Platelets were finally resuspended in the same buffer (3 × 108/ml) and perfused over a vWf matrix at a shear rate of 150 s−1. In the majority of experiments with washed platelets, flow was ceased for 5 min to maximize platelet adhesion onto the matrix. Flow was reinitiated at a shear rate of 750 s−1 and platelets washed with platelet washing buffer (containing platelet activation inhibitors) or Tyrode's buffer. In some studies, platelets were preincubated with cytochalasin D (10 μm) or latrunculin B (500 ng/ml) for 10 min, or with inhibitors of tyrosine kinases, PKC, PI 3-kinase, the prostaglandin pathway, or with EGTA-AM or BAPTA-AM for 30 min, as described under “Platelet Aggregation Studies.” Rolling platelets were visualized using fluorescence or differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy (100× objective) (Leica DMIRB) and videotaped for subsequent image analysis. Actin polymerization in vWf-aggregated platelets, transfected K562, and CHO cells was analyzed using a quantitative DNase I inhibition assay as described by Blikstadet al. (20Blikstad I. Markey F.

Washed platelets (3 × 108/ml) and transfected K562 or CHO cells (3 × 106/ml) were aggregated with either HvWf (20 μg/ml, unless otherwise specified) in the presence of ristocetin (1 mg/ml) or BvWf (20 μg/ml) alone with stirring for the indicated time points. Cells were then lysed in 1% Triton X-100-containing buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.1 μm phallacidin) and immediately subjected to DNase I inhibition assay. An alternative method (22Fox J.E.B. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), involving sedimentation of filamentous actin by ultracentrifugation (100,000 ×g for 3 h) of whole platelet lysates, yielded similar results to the DNase I inhibition assay. Full-length cDNAs for GPIbα, Ibβ and IX cloned into the pDX vector were generous donations from Dr. J. Lopez (Houston, TX). GPV was cloned into the pZeoSV vector. K562 cells were cultured in RPMI media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. CHO cells expressing GPIbβ and IX (CHOβIX, obtained from Dr. J. Lopez, Houston) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 400 μg/ml G418, and 100 μmmethotrexate. K562 cells were transfected with the cDNAs for GPIbα, GPIbβ, GPIX, and GPV, whereas CHOβIX cells were transfected with the cDNA for full-length wild type GPIbα cloned into pDX, using FuGene TP6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, FuGene TP6 (3 μl) and each plasmid (0.9 μg) were mixed with pZeoSV (0.1 μg) and incubated with K562 or CHOβIX cells for 3–7 h. Selection was initiated 3 days after transfection with 200 μg/ml Zeocin or G418. The individual Zeocin or G418-resistant CHO cell clones were isolated with glass cloning rings, and K562 clones were isolated by limiting dilution 2 weeks following selection. CHO cell clones expressing GPIbαβIX (CHOαβIX) and K562αβVIX cells were cultured for a further 2 weeks and subjected to immunofluorescence and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis to examine protein expression on the cell surface. CHO and K562 cells (1 × 106/ml) in Tyrode's buffer were applied to a HvWf (10 μg/ml) matrix in the presence of botrocetin (1 μg/ml) and allowed to adhere for 60 min at 37 °C, unless otherwise specified. In some studies, the cells were pretreated for 10 min with anti-GPIbα mAb (AK2), RGDS peptide (1 mm), EDTA (2 mm), cytochalasin D (1 μm), or 30 min with 80 μmEGTA-AM prior to application to vWf matrices. Where indicated, cells were also fixed in suspension with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min and then allowed to adhere onto poly-l-lysine (100 μg/ml)-coated coverslips. Non-adherent cells were removed by three gentle washes with PBS. Adherent cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min, and stained with FITC-conjugated phalloidin for 30 min. The cells were then washed three times with PBS and subjected to confocal fluorescence microscopy (Leica TCSNT, Germany) (16 and 100× objective). The images were reconstructed using VoxBlast software. The presence of membrane projections on a given cell was arbitrarily defined as membrane extensions (>2 μm in length) covering the entire surface of the cell. When CHO cell adhesion studies were performed under flow conditions, CHOαβIX cells (1 × 106/ml) were resuspended in Ca2+-free Tyrode's buffer containing 1 mmEDTA. Cells were perfused through a BvWf (100 μg/ml)-coated microcapillary tube at a shear rate of 150 or 1500 s−1, and flow was allowed for 10 min by perfusing Tyrode's buffer (containing 1 mm EDTA). The adherent cells were then fixed, permeabilized, stained with FITC-conjugated phalloidin and subjected to fluorescence microscopy. Washed platelets (1 × 109/ml) or CHOαβIX cells (1 × 106/ml) were resuspended in Ca2+-free Tyrode's buffer containing EGTA (1 mm). The cells were then incubated with the Ca2+-indicator dye, Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-AM-1 (1 μm), for 45 min at 37 °C. The platelets were then pelleted by centrifugation (2,000 × g for 5 min) and either resuspended in calcium-free Tyrode's buffer or washed autologous red blood cells to a final concentration of 1 × 107/ml. Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-AM-1-loaded CHOαβIX cells were resuspended in calcium-free Tyrode's buffer. In all experiments, EGTA (1 mm) was included in the cell suspensions to chelate trace quantities of extracellular calcium. Platelets were maintained at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of Fab c7E3 (20 μg/ml), prior to perfusion through HvWf (10 μg/ml)-coated microcapillary tube at a shear rate of 600, 1800, or 3000 s−1. In the indicated studies PGE1 (1 μg/ml) was added to the platelet suspensions to inhibit platelet activation. Changes in the cytosolic concentration of calcium were monitored with an upright confocal microscope (63× water lens) at a frame scan rate of 1 frame/s. For CHOαβIX studies, cells were perfused through BvWf (20 μg/ml)-coated microcapillary tubes at 150 s−1 and allowed to preadhere for 5 min. The non-adherent cells were removed and the adherent cells subjected to the indicated shear rates. A striking feature of the platelet adhesion process is the dramatic change in cell morphology induced by vWf binding to GPIb/V/IX and integrin αIIbβ3. Two actin-based structures are required for platelet spreading, filopodial bundles, and lamellipodial networks. The filopodial bundles are formed from long actin filaments radiating from the center of the platelet, whereas lamellipodial networks are formed from a circumferential zone of orthogonally arrayed short actin filaments (23Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1421-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) by which vWf induces platelet spreading remains poorly understood, although previous studies with Glanzmann thrombasthenic platelets (congenitally deficient in integrin αIIbβ3) indicate that integrin αIIbβ3 plays an important role in this process (14Weiss H.J. Turitto V.T. Baumgartner H.R. Blood. 1986; 67: 322-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sakariassen K.S. Nievelstein P.F.E.M. Coller B.S. Sixma J.J. Br. J. Haematol. 1986; 63: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In our initial studies we compared the ability of normal and Glanzmann thrombasthenic platelets to extend filopodia and lamellipodia following adhesion onto a purified vWf matrix. As demonstrated in Fig. 1 A,normal platelets adherent to a vWf matrix initially adopted a spherical morphology and extended multiple filopodial projections (Fig. 1 A, 10′). This was followed by the extension of broad lamellipodial sheets between adjacent filopodia, converting the platelet from a dendritic to a fully spread form (20′ and 60′). In contrast, Glanzmann thrombasthenic platelets adopted a spherical morphology and extended filopodia; however, lamellipodial formation was completely absent (Fig. 1 A). These results suggest that the vWf-GPIb/V/IX interaction may be sufficient to induce platelet shape change and filopodial extension, whereas the binding of vWf to integrin αIIbβ3 is essential for the formation of lamellipodial networks. Additional evidence in support of this hypothesis was derived from studies of normal platelets pretreated with the anti-αIIbβ3 chimeric Fab fragment of 7E3 (c7E3 Fab). Similar to Glanzmann thrombasthenic platelets, blocking ligand binding to integrin αIIbβ3 abolished lamellipodial formation but had no effect on the ability of platelets to change shape and extend filopodia (Fig. 1 B). A technical limitation of using HvWf for these studies was the inability of this protein to support stable adhesion in the presence of inhibitors of integrin αIIbβ3. It is possible that repeated washing may have preferentially removed discoid cells from the matrix leaving non-representative dendritic platelets. We therefore performed adhesion assays with purified BvWf, which supports stable platelet adhesion in the absence of integrin αIIbβ3. As with HvWf, all platelets pretreated with c7E3 Fab became spherical and extended filopodia after adhering to BvWf but were incapable of extending lamellipodia (Fig. 1 B). The ability of the vWf-GPIb/V/IX interaction to induce cytoskeletal reorganization in static adhesion assays raised the interesting possibility that similar morphological changes may occur during the process of platelet translocation on a vWf matrix. To adequately visualize the morphology of platelets under flow conditions, we performed all adhesion assays in flat rectangular microcapillary tubes, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This assay system enabled high magnification imaging of platelets in real-time with sufficient resolution to distinguish between resting discoid cells and dendritic forms. We initially performed flow studies on anticoagulated whole blood using DiOC6-labeled platelets. DiOC6 stains membrane lipid and enables visualization of membrane projections during the process of platelet activation (24Yabusaki K. Shirasawa Y. Hattori Y. Oda A. Ikeda Y. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports (1Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar), perfusion of whole blood over a vWf matrix at 150 s−1 in the presence of an inhibitor of integrin αIIbβ3 (c7E3 Fab) resulted in platelets forming reversible adhesion contacts with the matrix (Fig. 2 A). These adhesion contacts were mediated by the vWf-GPIb interaction as they were abolished by pretreating platelets with the anti-GPIb antibody, AK2 (Fig. 2 A, 1′ + AK2). Most platelets translocated in a stop-start manner, forming stationary adhesion contacts with the matrix for 1–5 s during surface translocation. As demonstrated in Fig. 2 A, the majority of platelets that initially tethered to vWf did not have filopodial projections (5″); however, during the process of platelet translocation these cells underwent morphological conversion to dendritic forms (1′). Morphological analysis of translocating platelets by DIC microscopy after washing out all non-adherent cells demonstrated the majority of platelets exhibited a spherical morphology and extended multiple filopodia (Fig. 2 A, DIC). In control studies, we confirmed that the vWf-induced morphological changes were not secondary to photoactivation of fluorescently labeled platelets, as DIC imaging of non-labeled platelets in anticoagulated whole blood revealed that all cells tethering to the matrix underwent shape change during surface translocation. Identical results were obtained using whole blood from an individual with Glanzmann thrombasthenia, confirming that these morphological changes occur independently of integrin αIIbβ3 (data not shown). Further evidence confirming that the vWf-GPIb interaction can induce cytoskeletal reorganization during the process of platelet translocation was obtained from studies using washed platelets. In these experiments washed platelets were perfused through vWf-coated microcapillary tubes in the presence of the platelet activation inhibitors, PGE1 and theophylline, to avoid platelet activation prior to cell contact with the vWf matrix. As detailed under “Experimental Procedures” considerable care was taken to ensure that platelets were not activated during the washing procedure. This included maintaining the platelet suspension at pH 6.5 and including platelet activation inhibitors from the mo"

Phanerochaete chrysosporium glyoxal oxidase Dactylium dendroides galactose oxidase wild type Glyoxal oxidase (GLOX)1from the wood-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium is a secreted enzyme that functions as an extracellular factory for production of hydrogen peroxide, fueling peroxidases (lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase) that are responsible for microbial lignin degradation (1Kersten P.J.

Glyoxal oxidase catalyzes the oxidization of aldehydes to carboxylic acids, coupled to reduction of dioxygen to hydrogen peroxide, RCHO+O2+H2O→RCO2H+H2O2(Eq. 1) The enzyme has fairly broad specificity for the reducing substrate, and a variety of simple dicarbonyl and hydroxycarbonyl compounds have been shown to support turnover. However, there is biological evidence that P. chrysosporium specifically secretes simple dicarbonyls (glyoxal and methylglyoxal) to drive this reaction. Further metabolism of the glyoxylic acid product leads to formation of oxalic acid, which has been identified as a cofactor for manganese peroxidase turnover (4Kuan I.-C. Tien M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In these enzymes, an amino acid side chain radical ligates the active site metal ion, forming a catalytic motif characteristic of a class of enzymes known as radical copper oxidases.

Two of the metal ligands (Tyr495 and His496) occur as consecutive residues in the protein sequence. The tyrosine ligands are distinct both in terms of coordination mode and, more especially, covalent modification of the side chain.

The second tyrosine (Tyr495) is bound axially to the active site metal ion, giving rise to distinctive features in the electronic spectra of the enzyme in the resting (TyrON) state and this residue has been shown to be displaced (producing a TyrOFF complex) when anions replace water in the inner sphere of the metal complex (19Whittaker M.M.

Baker, unpublished results. In the absence of high resolution structure information, theoretical sequence comparison makes it possible to identify putative active site residues (27Bork P. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Using predictions from a comparative sequence analysis, we have undertaken a mutagenic program targeting the key active site residues in glyoxal oxidase. Characterization of these mutant proteins clearly identifies the residues important for metal binding and catalysis.DISCUSSIONThe crystal structure for galactose oxidase (13Ito N. Phillips S.E.V. Yadav K.D.S. Knowles P.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 794-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) shows that its active site, comprising four metal binding residues (Tyr272, Tyr495, His496, and His581) together with a covalently attached cysteine (Cys228), is located in a distinct catalytic domain exhibiting an unusual 7-fold β-barrel structure (which has been described as a “super-barrel” or “β-flower”), a ring of seven protein wedges formed from β-strands, each wedge being four strands thick. The core of the ring is filled by a long, looping chain arising in a separate C-terminal domain that contributes one of the metal ligands (His581). Within the compact and tightly organized basket structure of the super-barrel fold there are a large number of turns, often associated with proline and glycine residues in the sequence. This pattern of turns may account for the relatively large number of conserved prolines and glycines identified in the sequence alignment of GAOX and GLOX, representing 25% of all identical residues (Fig. 2), implying a common fold for the two proteins.Because the residues forming the active site of galactose oxidase arise from remote segments of the linear polypeptide chain, large gaps separate most of the elements of the metal-binding site. This situation is quite different from what is commonly found in other metalloproteins, where short consensus sequences can often be identified as a metal binding motif. The most convincing theoretical evidence that the alignment correctly identifies active site residues is that these groups occur in a conserved context and that the spacings are well preserved between the two sequences, with the modularity of the super-barrel structure (27Bork P. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) determining the sequence distance between non-adjacent metal ligands. Thus, the gap between the two tyrosines that serve as metal ligands in galactose oxidase (Tyr272 and Tyr495) is 223 residues, representing four wedges containing an average of 55 residues. A similar gap (242 residues) occurs between the (putative) active site tyrosines (Tyr135 and Tyr377) in the GLOX sequence. The similarity of sequence context for the critical residues further supports the significance of the sequence correlations and their identification as structural motifs.Mutagenesis of the putative active site residues provides a crucial experimental test of the predictions provided by these sequence comparison studies. While in vitro site-directed mutagenesis of structural genes has become straightforward, systematic expression of the protein products is more problematic. We have found it difficult to consistently prepare stable transformants for high level production of GLOX protein in the A. nidulans expression system that has been useful for production of wild type protein, and have explored the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris (36Cregg J.M. Vedvick T.S. Raschke W.C. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 37Higgins D.R. Cregg J.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 103: 1-15PubMed Google Scholar) as an alternative heterologous expression host. In Pichia, it is possible to directly select (by antibiotic resistance) for rare multicopy integrants that tend to produce the highest levels of protein through gene dosage effects. In addition, the strong induction provided by the alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promotor in Pichia and the efficient secretory pathways in this organism make it an extremely useful system for high level extracellular expression of recombinant proteins (36Cregg J.M. Vedvick T.S. Raschke W.C. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 37Higgins D.R. Cregg J.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 103: 1-15PubMed Google Scholar), allowing us to produce up to 2 g/liter of protein in high density fermentation for three of the four mutants chosen for this study. For the three highly expressed mutants (C70A, Y135F, and Y377F) the mutation involves conservative substitution by a less bulky amino acid, while the increased bulk of the H153W mutant may actually destabilize the protein, accounting for lack of detectable expression in that case. Efficient export of foreign proteins by heterologous expression host is known to depend on the nature of the N-terminal leader peptide signal sequence. We find that the 24-amino acid A. niger glucoamylase secretion signal (gla) served very effectively to direct protein export in Pichia.All three mutants exhibited a dramatic loss of enzymatic activity that supports their identification as critical catalytic residues. Spectroscopic and biochemical characterization of the mutants confirms the structural analogies to galactose oxidase and demonstrate the roles of these residues in active site function. Y377F mutagenesis leaves the essential metal-binding site intact, allowing this mutant to be purified with nearly full copper complement. The optical absorption and CD spectra of the Cu(II) complex (Fig. 3,right) are characteristic of the TyrOFF (low pH or ligand-bound) form of wt GLOX (Fig. 3, right, inset), but, unlike the wt protein, the mutant does not convert at high pH to a distinct TyrON form (Fig. 4,top). Instead, only a slight red-shift in the absorption is observed, consistent with formation of a hydroxide complex at high pH. The EPR spectrum of the Cu(II) complex (Fig. 5 A) has g z and a z Cu values characteristic of tetragonal Cu(II) site, and is similar to that found for wt GLOX including the presence of partly resolved ligand hyperfine splittings in them I = +½ copper hyperfine feature that reflect coordination by two nitrogen donors (e.g.bis-histidine ligation). Exogenous ligands (e.g. azide) are able to bind to the metal ion, and the azide complex is nearly indistinguishable from the same complex of wt enzyme by absorption, CD (Fig. 3) and EPR (Fig. 5 B) spectroscopies. Direct azide ligation to Cu(II) produces additional ligand hyperfine broadening in the EPR spectrum, due to the additional 14N interaction in the complex. Together, these results confirm the assignment of tyrosine Tyr377 to the “axial tyrosine” in the GLOX active site corresponding to Y495 in GAOX. The GLOX(Y377F) mutant retains the ability to form a radical-Cu(II) complex (shown by the disappearance of the Cu(II) EPR signal) (5Whittaker M.M. Kersten P.J. Nakamura N. Sanders-Loehr J. Schweizer E.S. Whittaker J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 681-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) but this complex is inactive, as expected based on our previous identification of the axial tyrosine requirement for substrate activation in the radical-copper oxidase turnover mechanism. The absence of any significant Cu(II) signal in the oxidized complex contrasts with results reported for the axial tyrosine mutant of GAOX (Y495F) where only ∼10% of the expected radical-coupled copper complex was formed (24Reynolds M.P. Baron A.J. Wilmot C.M. Vinecombe E. Stevens C. Phillips S.E.V. Knowles P.F. McPherson M.J. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 327-335Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar).The optical spectrum of the oxidized Y377F mutant (Fig. 3,left) exhibits strong absorption features that correspond to the TyrOFF form of the radical-containing wt GLOX (Fig. 3,left, inset). The absence of an intense near IR absorption feature of the oxidized wt GLOX, previously assigned to a ligand-to-ligand charge transfer absorption between axial and radical tyrosine ligands in galactose oxidase, provides additional evidence that Tyr377 is the axial tyrosine ligand in GLOX. The observation that azide binding does not affect the near IR absorption feature strengthens the correlation with the TyrOFF form of the active wt enzyme. The oxidized Y377F protein exhibits a minority free radical EPR signal (Fig. 5 C) (<0.02 spins/active site) that probably arises within the ∼30% apoprotein in the sample. A similar signal is observed in wt enzyme under the same conditions (5Whittaker M.M. Kersten P.J. Nakamura N. Sanders-Loehr J. Schweizer E.S. Whittaker J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 681-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The signal is characteristic of a phenoxyl radical (gav = 2.006) and spectral simulation requires a relatively axial g tensor that is the signature of the Tyr-Cys radical species (Fig. 6). The g values are slightly larger than observed for the Tyr-Cys radical in galactose oxidase, indicating distinct radical environments in the two proteins. The observation of a redox active Tyr-Cys group in the protein demonstrates that although Tyr377 is required for turnover it is not essential for biogenesis of the radical cofactor.Two mutants that are predicted to affect the equatorial ligation of copper (C70A and Y135F) are both isolated mainly as apoprotein, although reconstitution restores full metal content and permits spectroscopic characterization of the complex. Reconstituted C70A mutant exhibits an optical spectrum characteristic of Cu(II)-phenolate complexes (Fig. 4, bottom, A), with absorption near 465 nm typical of phenolate to Cu(II) ligand-to-metal charge transfer, but at longer wavelength and somewhat lower intensity than found for phenolate-Cu(II) spectra of wt GLOX (Fig. 3, right, inset). The corresponding galactose oxidase C228G mutant was also reported to contain substoichiometric copper as isolated and exhibited optical spectra similar to that found here although with slightly lower intensities. In GAOX this Cys residue forms a covalent bond to the redox-active Tyr, and its substitution by an unreactive amino acid prevents formation of the mature redox cofactor. The spectra in these complexes arise from a tetragonal Cu(II) having an unmodified Tyr phenolate coordinated in the equatorial plane. The EPR spectrum of the Cu(II) complex (Fig. 5 D) is relatively broad and lacking resolved ligand hyperfine structure, implying a degree of heterogeneity in the metal-binding site that is consistent with the greater mobility afforded an uncross-linked tyrosine residue. Y135F mutagenesis has an even greater effect on the optical spectrum (Fig. 4, bottom, B), dramatically lowering the absorption intensity with loss of the 465 nm absorption assigned to equatorial tyrosinate coordination. These features, and the absence of radical forming cofactor in GLOX(Y135F) mutant allows identification of Tyr135 as a copper ligand and the radical redox site corresponding to Tyr272 in GAOX. EPR evidence for a tetragonal Cu(II) complex (Fig. 5 E) may imply that a hydroxide ion substitutes for the tyrosinate oxygen in the mutant protein, forming a tetragonal complex together with a second water and the two nitrogenous ligands.For all three mutants, replacement of residues predicted to be essential for catalysis dramatically reduces catalytic activity (Table I), leaving a small but detectable activity approximately 10-fold greater than the background observed for a nonspecific protein control (bovine serum albumin). This activity might reflect a residual activity of the mutant active sites, as concluded in previous studies of the corresponding mutants of galactose oxidase (23Baron A.J. Stevens C. Wilmot C. Seneviratne K.D. Blakeley V. Dooley D.M. Phillips S.E.V. Knowles P.F. McPherson M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25095-25105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, that interpretation cannot account for the 5-fold difference in activity observed for Y377F mutants expressed in different hosts (Aspergillus and Pichia), for proteins that are nearly indistinguishable in terms of spectra and metal content. Furthermore, the residual activity of the mutant proteins does not appear to correlate with metal content. Thus, for the C70A mutant, a 100-fold increase in copper content resulted in only a doubling of the specific activity, and similarly a 30-fold increase in copper content was associated with only 4-fold higher specific activity for reconstituted GLOX(Y135F) (Table I). The residual activity is, in fact, so minute (0.01–0.04% of wild type) as to be consistent with a minority fraction of wild type enzyme that might result, for example, from unselected spontaneous reversion or, more likely, from missense translation errors (38Stansfield I. Jones K.M. Herbert P. Lewendon A. Shaw W.V. Tuite M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 39Kurland C. Gallant J. Curr. Opin. Bio/Technology. 1996; 7: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Missense substitution and processivity errors have been reported to rise as high as 1% during overexpression of heterologous proteins (39Kurland C. Gallant J. Curr. Opin. Bio/Technology. 1996; 7: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).In conclusion, mutagenesis of GLOX permits identification of three catalytic residues (Cys70, Tyr135, and Tyr377) and demonstrates their respective functions in the active site. Based on these studies, the active site of glyoxal oxidase can be represented as shown in Fig. 1. As proposed for GAOX, an axial tyrosine (Tyr377 in GLOX) will function as a general base required for proton abstraction from the coordinated hydroxyl group, activating the substrate for oxidation. In addition to this basic group, radical-redox site derived from a tyrosine residue by covalent coupling to cysteine must also be present in the enzyme to support turnover. In GLOX this site is formed from Cys70 and Tyr135, with the latter side chain coordinating directly to copper in the active site. Elimination of any of these groups removes an essential catalytic function and blocks turnover. Glyoxal oxidase (GLOX)1from the wood-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium is a secreted enzyme that functions as an extracellular factory for production of hydrogen peroxide, fueling peroxidases (lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase) that are responsible for microbial lignin degradation (1Kersten P.J. Kirk T.K. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2195-2201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kersten P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2936-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 3Hammel K.E. Mozuch M.D. Jensen Jr., K.A. Kersten P.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13349-13354Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Glyoxal oxidase catalyzes the oxidization of aldehydes to carboxylic acids, coupled to reduction of dioxygen to hydrogen peroxide, RCHO+O2+H2O→RCO2H+H2O2(Eq. 1) The enzyme has fairly broad specificity for the reducing substrate, and a variety of simple dicarbonyl and hydroxycarbonyl compounds have been shown to support turnover. However, there is biological evidence that P. chrysosporium specifically secretes simple dicarbonyls (glyoxal and methylglyoxal) to drive this reaction. Further metabolism of the glyoxylic acid product leads to formation of oxalic acid, which has been identified as a cofactor for manganese peroxidase turnover (4Kuan I.-C. Tien M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1242-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Previous studies of glyoxal oxidase (5Whittaker M.M. Kersten P.J. Nakamura N. Sanders-Loehr J. Schweizer E.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 681-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that it is a copper metalloenzyme containing an unusual free radical-coupled copper active site similar to that found in galactose oxidase (GAOX) (6Whittaker J.W.

In these enzymes, an amino acid side chain radical ligates the active site metal ion, forming a catalytic motif characteristic of a class of enzymes known as radical copper oxidases. This radical-copper complex acts as a two-electron redox active site, a distinction from other free radical enzymes (ribonucleotide reductase, etc.) (8Stubbe J. van der Donk W.A. Chem.

Calcineurin is the target of the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 complexed with their cytoplasmic receptors cyclophilin and FKBP12, respectively. In this study we report that calcineurin is also the target of a recently identified Ca2+-binding protein, CHP (forcalcineurin homologous protein), which shares a high degree of homology with the regulatory B subunit of calcineurin and with calmodulin. In Jurkat and HeLa cells, overexpression of CHP specifically impaired the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of NFAT but had no effect on AP-1 transcriptional activity and only a small (<25%) inhibitory effect on the transcriptional activity of NFκB. Further study indicated that CHP inhibits calcineurin activity. In cells overexpressing CHP, the phosphatase activity of immunoprecipitated calcineurin was inhibited by ∼50%; and in a reconstituted assay, the activity of purified calcineurin was inhibited up to 97% by the addition of purified recombinant CHP in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, prolonged activation of Jurkat cells was associated with a decreased abundance of CHP, suggesting a possible regulatory mechanism allowing activation of calcineurin.

Of the 31 predicted binding epitopes shared by CaM and CnB, 70% are found in CHP, which suggests it may share similar mechanisms for target binding with CnB and CaM. To investigate this hypothesis, we determined whether CHP regulates calcineurin, a common target of CaM and CnB in T cells. Here we show that overexpression of CHP in HeLa and Jurkat cells impairs the nuclear translocation and the transcriptional activity of NFAT. CHP effects on NFAT are likely mediated by its ability to inhibit calcineurin. We found that CHP inhibits calcineurin phosphatase activity in vivo and in a reconstituted assay with purified proteins by impairing the assembly of the heterotrimeric configuration. Additionally, activation of T-cell signaling led to a decrease in CHP abundance, suggesting a positive feedback mechanism of releasing an inhibitory action of CHP during T-cell receptor signaling. A23187 was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The phorbol ester PMA and cyclosporin A (CsA) were purchased from Calbiochem. CaM-Sepharose and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (catalytic subunit) were from Sigma. Myc and flag epitope sequences were individually fused in-frame to the 3′-end of CHP cDNA by using polymerase chain reaction, and these tagged constructs were then subcloned into the expression plasmid pcDNA1. Rat CnA cDNA, a gift from B. Perrino (University of Neveda at Reno), was tagged with an HA epitope sequence in frame at the 3′-end and subcloned into pcDNA1. Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (3.2 g of glucose/ml) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. CCL39 hamster lung fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4.5 g of glucose/ml) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Jurkat cells were transfected by electroporation in serum-free medium in 0.4-cm cuvettes with settings of 250 V and 960 millifarads, using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. CCL39 and HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids by using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Jurkat cells were co-transfected with luciferase reporter constructs and either empty vector (control) or CHP. We used reporter constructs for NFAT, containing three copies of the consensus NFAT-binding site from the IL-2 promoter; for AP-1, containing four copies of the consensus AP-1-binding site from the metallothienein promoter (obtained from A. Weiss, University of California, San Francisco); and for NFκB, containing three copies of the NFκB-binding site from the IL-2 receptor α promoter (obtained from K. Yamamoto, University of California, San Francisco). To normalize luciferase activity to transfection efficiency, cells were also transfected with an expression vector encoding β-galactosidase (Invitrogen). 18 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with A23187 (1 μm) plus PMA (50 ng/ml) for 6 h, harvested and lysed in a reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity, assayed by using Analytic Luminescence Laboratory's assay reagents, and β-galactosidase activity, determined by using a Galacto Light Plus kit (Tropix), were measured in a Luminometer Monolight 2010 (Analytic Luminescence Laboratory). Data were expressed as luciferase activity relative to β-galactosidase expression. HeLa cells grown overnight on glass coverslips were transfected with HA-tagged NFATp1C (obtained from A. Rao, Harvard Medical School) in the absence or presence of flag-tagged CHP. 4 h after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then were either left unstimulated or incubated with A23187 (1 μm) and PMA (50 ng/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with methanol for 2 min, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min, and then stained with polyclonal anti-HA antibodies (Babco, Richmond, CA) and monoclonal anti-flag antibodies (Eastman Kodak Co., New Haven, CT). After staining with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA), cells were washed, mounted, and viewed using a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope. [Ca2+] i of HeLa cells transfected with vector control or CHP was measured using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator indo-1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and analyzed by flow cytometry (24Szollosi J. Feuerstein B.G. Hyun W.C. Das M.K. Marton L.J. Cytometry. 1991; 12: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in 3 μm indo-1-AM for 30 min at 37 °C to allow complete hydrolysis of indo-1-AM and to avoid ester fluorescence. The cells were washed and resuspended in HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES, 123 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, and 5 mm sodium pyruvate, pH 7.2) for 10 min. Suspensions of cells loaded with indo-1 were analyzed in a Becton-Dickinson 440 flow cytometer at 37 °C as described (24Szollosi J. Feuerstein B.G. Hyun W.C. Das M.K. Marton L.J.

Symons, Picower Institute for Medical Research) was co-transfected to identify transfected cells. The ratio of emission spectra of Ca2+-bound and free indo-1 was determined in resting cells that were maintained in serum-free medium overnight and in cells treated with A23718/PMA. Ratiometric determinations were also made in cells treated with the Ca2+ chelators BAPTA (Molecular Probes) and EDTA. RII peptide was prepared and radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP by cAMP-dependent protein kinase as described (25Swanson S.K. Born T. Zydowsky L.D. Cho H. Chang H.Y. Walsh C.T. Rusnak F. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Briefly, RII peptide (0.15 mm) was phosphorylated in 1 ml of phosphorylation reaction buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.3 mm ATP, 2500 units of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and 833 μCi/mmol of [γ-32P]ATP) for 3 h at 30 °C. The radiolabeled peptide was then purified by a Sep-Pak cartridge, speedvac-dried, and dissolved in 1 ml of 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0 (75,000 cpm/μl). CCL39 cells, transfected with HA-tagged CnA alone and co-transfected with CHP, were lysed for 15 min at 4 °C with CnA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and proteinase inhibitors). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and precleared with protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). HA-CnA was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies and recovered using protein A-Sepharose 4B beads. The beads were washed three times with CnA lysis buffer and stored at 4 °C for phosphatase assays. For immunoprecipitation of CnA from CsA-treated cells, cells were incubated with medium containing 1 nm of CsA for 1 h at 37 °C before harvesting. The activity of calcineurin, either precipitated from whole-cell lysates or reconstituted by the combination of pure CnA, CnB, and CaM (0.1 μm each) (27Sikkink R. Haddy A. MacKelvie S. Mertz P. Litwiller R. Rusnak F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8348-8356Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), was assayed using the32P-RII peptide as a substrate (27Sikkink R. Haddy A. MacKelvie S. Mertz P. Litwiller R. Rusnak F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8348-8356Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, calcineurin was preincubated at 30 °C for 10 min in a reaction buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol). The reaction was then initiated by the addition of32P-RII (200,000 cpm) and continued at 30 °C for 10 min with rotation before quenching with 5% trichloroacetate and 0.1 m potassium phosphate. The reaction mixtures were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatant was mixed with 100 ml of cation-exchange resin (Bio-Rad AG 50W-X4 H+ form, 400 mesh, washed successively before use with water, 1.0 m NaOH, 1.0 m HCl, and water again) at room temperature for 20 min with agitation. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min, the supernatant containing released [32P]orthophosphate was removed and added to 7.0 ml of scintillation mixture for assay of radioactivity. To study the effect of CHP on reconstituted calcineurin activity, pure CHP was prepared from recombinant GST-CHP fusion protein, as described (15Lin X. Barber D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12631-12636Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), by proteolytic cleavage with thrombin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), following separation from GST-Sepharose beads. CCL39 cells were transfected with HA-tagged CnA alone or co-transfected with CHP. 4 h after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then lysed for 15 min at 4 °C with a cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and proteinase inhibitors). The cell lysates were then mixed with 30 μl of CaM-Sepharose pre-equilibrated with a reaction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.22 m NaCl, 1.0 mm MgAc2, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μm CaCl2) on a rotator for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting mixtures were centrifuged and washed with the lysis buffer. The amount of HA-CnA bound to CaM-Sepharose and HA-CnA in total cell lysates was determined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-HA antibodies. Myc-tagged CHP and HA-tagged CnA were transiently expressed individually or co-expressed in CCL39 cells. Coimmunoprecipitation of CHP and CnA was performed as described (15Lin X. Barber D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12631-12636Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Briefly, total cell lysates from the [35S]methionine-labeled cells were used for the first immunoprecipitation of CnA with anti-HA antibodies, and the immunoprecipitation products were disrupted by boiling with 0.5% SDS lysis buffer and subjected to a second immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoprecipitated products were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Total lysates (30 μg) from control Jurkat cells or cells treated with A23187/PMA for the indicated times were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. CHP was detected in Western blot using anti-CHP antibody and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, and visualized by chemiluminescence with ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The same membrane was striped and re-blotted with anti-actin antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to normalize the abundance of CHP. To investigate the hypothesis that CHP may share similar targets with CaM and CnB, we determined whether CHP regulates the phosphatase activity of the catalytic subunit of calcineurin, a common target of CaM and CnB in T cells. First, we determined the effect of CHP on the transcriptional activity of NFAT, a direct substrate of calcineurin. A luciferase reporter plasmid containing tandem copies of the NFAT-binding site derived from the IL-2 promoter was co-expressed in Jurkat cells with either control vector or CHP. NFAT activity, as measured by the reporter luciferase activity, was assayed in untreated cells and in cells treated with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 and PMA for 6 h. In vector-transfected cells treated with A23187 and PMA, NFAT activity increased more than 20-fold compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1 A). Overexpression of CHP, however, inhibited this activation by 70% (Fig. 1 A). To determine the specificity of this inhibition, we examined the effect of CHP on two additional transcription factors, NFκB and AP-1, using luciferase reporter plasmids containing tandem copies of either the NFκB- or the AP-1-binding sites. Overexpression of CHP had no effect on the activation of AP-1 transcriptional activity induced by A23187 and PMA treatment; however, it inhibited NFκB activation by about 25% (Fig. 1 A), consistent with previous findings that calcineurin can act in synergy with PMA to activate NFκB (28Frantz B. Nordby E.C. Bren G. Steffan N. Paya C.V. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Keefe S.J. O'Neill E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). CHP inhibition of NFAT activity was dose-dependent, as decreasing the amount of CHP cDNA in the transfection reaction reduced the attenuation of NFAT activity (Fig. 1 B). Activation of NFAT is associated with its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (29Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Miner Z. Kerppola T.K. Lambert J.N. Verdine G.L. Curran T. Rao A. Nature. 1993; 365: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the inhibition of NFAT activity by CHP was because of impaired nuclear importation of NFAT. Translocation of HA-tagged NFAT, co-expressed with vector control or flag-tagged CHP, was determined by indirect immunofluorescence in HeLa cells. HeLa cells have more abundant cytoplasm than Jurkat cells, which makes it easier to assess cytoplasmic and nuclear localization. In quiescent cells, NFAT staining was observed exclusively in the cytoplasm of vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2 A, panel a). Within 30 min after treatment with A23187 and PMA, NFAT staining was exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 2 A, panel b). This is similar to the time course of NFAT nuclear translocation observed in murine lymphocytes (30Timmerman L.A. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Northrop J.P. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In quiescent CHP-expressing cells, NFAT staining was also exclusively in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2 A, panel c). After A23187 and PMA treatment, however, NFAT was observed in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (Fig. 2 A, panel d). This suggested that overexpression of CHP impairs the stimulus-induced translocation of NFAT but not the cytoplasmic localization of NFAT in quiescent cells. Quantitation of the subcellular distribution of NFAT staining indicated that, in approximately 60% of the CHP-transfected cells, nuclear translocation of NFAT was completely or partially blocked (Fig. 2 B). Hence, CHP expression inhibits the Ca2+-dependent nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of NFAT. The ability of CHP to inhibit NFAT nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity suggested that CHP, like CaM, might regulate calcineurin activity. However, because calcineurin is activated by a Ca2+-dependent signaling pathway and CHP is a Ca2+-binding protein, we first investigated whether overexpression of CHP inhibited NFAT activity by chelating cytosolic free Ca2+ and preventing increases in [Ca2+] i . Intracellular [Ca2+] was determined in HeLa cells transfected with either empty vector or CHP by use of the fluorescent free-Ca2+ indicator, indo-1. Cells were co-transfected with green fluorescent protein, and the indo-1 fluorescence ratio was analyzed by flow cytometry. In vector-transfected cells, A23187 and PMA treatment caused an increase of [Ca2+] i, as indicated by the increased ratio of Ca2+-bound to free indo-1. This increase was inhibited in cells treated with the Ca2+ chelators EDTA and BAPTA (Fig. 3). In CHP-transfected cells, basal [Ca2+] i and the stimulus-induced elevation of [Ca2+] i were similar to those in vector controls (Fig. 3), which suggested that inhibition of NFAT activity by CHP was not because of impaired intracellular Ca2+ dynamics. One likely mechanism for the effects of CHP on NFAT, therefore, is the specific regulation of calcineurin activity. To investigate this possibility, we immunoprecipitated HA-tagged calcineurin, transiently expressed alone or co-expressed with CHP in CCL39 fibroblasts, with anti-HA antibodies and assayed the phosphatase activity of the precipitated calcineurin complex in vitro using32P-labeled synthetic RII peptide as a substrate. Calcineurin phosphatase activity in vector control cells was inhibited by 50% in cells co-transfected with CHP (Fig. 4 A). The ability of calcineurin to dephosphorylate [32P]RIIpeptide was completely inhibited when vector control cells were treated with the immunosuppressant CsA (Fig. 4 A), indicating a calcineurin-specific dephosphorylation of the [32P]RII peptide. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that equivalent amounts of CnA were immunoprecipitated in each sample (Fig. 4 A). We next investigated whether CHP would inhibit calcineurin phosphatase activity by use of an in vitro reconstitution assay. Maximal phosphatase activity, determined as the amount of released free32P from dephosphorylation of [32P]RII peptide, was obtained with a combination of purified recombinant CnA, CnB, and CaM (Fig. 4 B). Addition of 10 μm purified CHP to the reaction mixture inhibited phosphatase activity by 97% (Fig. 4 B). As expected, a GST fusion protein of immunophilin FKBP12 alone had no effect on calcineurin phosphatase activity, but co-addition of GST-FKBP12 with the immunosuppressant FK506 blocked dephosphorylation of RII peptide (Fig. 4 B), confirming the specificity of calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation in the reconstituted system. CHP inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase activity was dose-dependent, with an ID50 of ∼4 μm (Fig. 4 C). In contrast to its effect with purified CnA and CnB subunits, CHP only partially inhibited the phosphatase activity of bovine calcineurin (∼40% inhibition with 44 μm; data not shown). Hence, although CHP directly inhibited the phosphatase activity of calcineurin using recombinant subunits in a reconstitution assay, it had much less potent effects on the holoenzyme in which the CnA and CnB subunits exist as a tightly associated, preassembled heterodimer. CHP had no effect on phosphatase activity in the absence of CnB or CaM (Fig. 4 D), indicating that it cannot substitute for either CnB or CaM to reconstitute calcineurin activity. The exclusive cytoplasmic localization of NFAT in resting cells overexpressing CHP (Fig. 2,A and B) also indicates that CHP does not partially activate calcineurin activity. To determine the mechanism of inhibition of calcineurin by CHP, we tested whether CHP might impair Ca2+-induced phosphatase activity by interfering with CaM binding to the CnA-CnB complex. Using the purified bovine heterodimer, CHP (up to 8 μm) did not impair binding of bovine calcineurin to CaM-Sepharose (data not shown). Similar results were obtained using the isolated CnA subunit, either in the presence or absence of CnB. Furthermore, using the isolated subunits in the in vitro reconstitution and phosphatase assay described above, calmodulin up to 100 μm was unable to compete for and reverse the inhibitory effects of CHP on calcineurin phosphatase activity (Fig. 4 E). These results suggest that CHP does not competitively bind to the CaM-binding site on the catalytic CnA subunit. Nevertheless, in lysates from cells transfected with CHP, the binding of CnA and CaM was impaired (Fig. 5 A). Cell lysates from resting CCL39 cells expressing HA-tagged CnA alone, or co-expressing HA-CnA and myc-tagged CHP, were incubated with Sepharose-conjugated CaM in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2. The amount of calcineurin bound to CaM-Sepharose was determined by immunoblot analysis with anti-HA antibodies. In lysates from CHP-transfected cells, the amount of CnA bound to CaM-Sepharose was reduced by 75% compared with that of vector control cells (Fig. 5 A). Although the amount of HA-CnA applied to CaM-Sepharose from cells transfected with CHP was 20% less than that from control cells, determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5 A), this could not account for the 75% inhibition observed for CnA binding to CaM. CHP did not bind to CaM-Sepharose in either the absence or presence of Ca2+ (data not shown), suggesting that the decreased CnA binding to CaM-Sepharose in cells overexpressing CHP was not caused by the competitive binding of CHP to CaM-Sepharose. Additionally, we previously determined that CHP binds to the Na-H exchanger at a site distinct from that for CaM (15Lin X. Barber D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12631-12636Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data suggest that CHP inhibits calcineurin phosphatase activity by altering the association of CnA, CnB, and CaM subunits that lead to a native, heterotrimeric structure. They also suggest that CHP could impair the ability of calcineurin to bind to CaM-Sepharose in vivo via an as yet unidentified cellular component. The ability of CHP to directly inhibit calcineurin activity suggested that CHP might physically interact with the A subunit of calcineurin. To investigate this possibility, we determined whether CHP associates with CnA in vivo. HA-tagged CnA was expressed alone or co-expressed with CHP-myc in CCL39 cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine. HA-CnA was immunoprecipitated first with anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1–3), and the precipitated complexes were then disrupted and subjected to a second immunoprecipitation with anti-myc antibodies (Fig. 5 B,lanes 4–6). CHP was detected in immunoprecipitated CnA complexes (Fig. 5 B, lane 6), which suggested anin vivo association between CHP and CnA. Myc-tagged CHP also co-precipitated with endogenous CnA, as detected with anti-CnA antibodies (data not shown). Our findings indicate that CHP inhibits the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of NFAT by suppressing the Ca2+-dependent activation of calcineurin. Hence, under physiological conditions, the abundance of CHP might be a determinant in regulating the ability of calcineurin to activate NFAT. Accordingly, we determined that prolonged activation of T cells is associated with a decrease in CHP expression (Fig. 6 A). In the presence of A23187 and PMA, CHP protein abundance in Jurkat cells decreased by 65% at 3 h and by 80% at 9 h (Fig. 6 B). Northern blot analysis indicated that CHP transcript remained unchanged by T-cell activation for up to 9 h (data not shown), suggesting that changes in CHP protein abundance were post-transcriptionally regulated. The post-transcriptional regulation of CHP expression, therefore, may be a physiologically important mechanism for regulating its actions. The precise mechanism whereby CHP associates with CnA and impairs phosphatase activity remains to be determined. CnA contains at least four functional domains: the catalytic domain at the N terminus, the CnB- and CaM-binding domains at the central region, and an autoinhibitory domain at the C terminus (12Klee C.B. Draetta G.F. Hubbard M.J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 149-200PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kincaid R.L. Nightingale M.S. Martin B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Calcineurin phosphatase activity is regulated by the binding of CnB and CaM to CnA, which induces a conformational change in the catalytic domain (12Klee C.B. Draetta G.F. Hubbard M.J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 149-200PubMed Google Scholar, 31Perrino B.A. Ng L.Y. Soderling T.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 1924-1927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, Ca2+-dependent binding of CaM to the CnA-CnB complex imparts Ca2+ sensitivity to calcineurin and activates calcineurin by abolishing the interaction of the autoinhibitory domain with the catalytic domain of CnA (31Perrino B.A. Ng L.Y. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 340-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 34Hashimoto Y. Perrino B.A. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1924-1927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunosuppressive drugs CsA and FK506 complexed with their cytosolic receptors bind to the latch region where CnB and CnA interact, thereby preventing a conformational change in CnA required for its activation (26Milan D. Griffith J. Su M. Price E.R. McKeon F. Cell. 1994; 79: 437-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 35Kawamura A. Su M.S.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15463-15466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We found that CHP interacts with CnA and prevents its activation. The association of CHP with CnA also does not reconstitute CnA activity in the presence of either CnB or CaM (Fig. 4 C). This suggests that its association with CnA does not result in a conformation-induced release of the autoinhibitory domain. Hence, CHP may act in a manner analogous to the action of CsA and FK506 to prevent the allosteric activation of calcineurin. Recent reports have identified additional proteins that inhibit calcineurin, including Cabin 1/Cain (36Sun L. Youn H.D. Loh C. Stolow M. He W. Liu J.O. Immunity. 1998; 8: 703-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 37Lai M.M. Burnett P.E. Wolosker H. Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27412-27419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Like CHP, these proteins bind to the catalytic CnA subunit and inhibit phosphatase activity. CHP, Cabin 1/Cain, and AKAP79, therefore, may represent an emerging class of endogenous calcineurin regulators. Calcineurin is a broadly distributed phosphatase that plays diverse roles in addition to T-cell activation, including the regulation of axonal guidance (39Chang H.Y. Takei K. Sydor A.M. Born T. Rusnak F. Jay D.G. Nature. 1995; 376: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), the Ca2+-dependent migration of neutrophils (40Lawson M.A. Maxfield F.R.

Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12631-12636Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), it may regulate other actions of calcineurin in addition to NFAT activity during T-cell activation. Our findings provide a basis for further investigation of the signaling mechanisms that control CHP regulation of calcineurin. We thank A. Weiss and J.

Each molecule is a heterotrimer composed of two α1(I) chains and one α2(I) chain. It contains a long triple helical domain (∼1000 residues from each chain) and short, non-helical terminal peptides (telopeptides). In vitro, under appropriate conditions, type I molecules spontaneously form fibers that are virtually indistinguishable from native fibers by electron microscopy (see, for example, Ref. 3Williams B.R. Gelman R.A. Poppke D.C. Piez K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253 (and references therein): 6578-6585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). X-ray diffraction patterns from such reconstituted fibers and from native fibers are similar as well (4Eikenberry E.F. Brodsky B. J. Mol.

Tanaka S. Eikenberry E.F. Nimni M.E. Collagen. I. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1988: 95-112Google Scholar). It is commonly believed that type I collagen contains all structural information that is necessary for its self-assembly into fibers, except maybe for some tissue-specific factors (see, for example, Ref. 8Veis A. Payne K. Nimni M.E. Collagen. I. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1988: 113-137Google Scholar). However, the location of the “coding” regions, the nature of this information, and how it is “translated” into intermolecular forces responsible for fibrillogenesis are still poorly understood. One of the debated issues is the role of telopeptides. Telopeptides form covalent cross-links with triple helical regions on opposing molecules (see, for example, Refs. 9Eyre D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 717-748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 10Yamauchi M. Mechanic G.L. Nimni M.E. Collagen. I. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1988: 157-172Google Scholar). It is believed that this occurs after completion of fibrillogenesis and that the cross-links stabilize rather than create appropriate molecular arrangement. It was also suggested that telopeptides are important at earlier stages,i.e. in the process of fibrillogenesis. This hypothesis is based primarily on studies of enzymatically treated collagen. Specifically, partial or complete removal of telopeptides alters the kinetics of collagen fiber formation (11Comper W.D. Veis A.

These data clearly establish that telopeptides play some role in fibrillogenesis kinetics. Do they mean, however, that telopeptides contain a code necessary for recognition and appropriate packing of collagen into fibers? This work revisits the question. It builds on recent advances in direct measurement of intermolecular forces by osmotic stress and x-ray diffraction (18Rau D.C. Lee B. Parsegian V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2621-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 19Parsegian V.A. Rand R.P. Fuller N.L. Rau D.C.

We apply this new technique to measurement of forces between collagen molecules in fibers and combine it with traditional in vitro fibrillogenesis assays. We compare acid-soluble collagen (AcCol)1 with pepsin-treated collagen (PepCol) and with Pronase-treated collagen (PronCol). We find that marked changes in collagen-collagen interactions and in fibrillogenesis competency occur only after prolonged Pronase treatment. These changes coincide with cleavage of the triple helix rather than with telopeptide removal. Type I collagen was extracted from rat tail tendon as described previously (20Leikin S. Rau D.C. Parsegian V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 21Leikin S. Rau D.C. Parsegian V.A. Nat. Struct.

Briefly, frozen tails of young rats were purchased from Pel-Freez Biologicals and stored frozen at −20 °C. Tails were thawed in cold (4 °C) protease-inhibiting buffer (3.5 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 20 mm EDTA, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pH 7.5)). Tendons were excised from tails, washed in the same buffer for several days at 4 °C, and then dissolved in 0.5 m acetic acid (pH 2.8). Solubilized tendons were digested by pepsin (Calbiochem) as described (23Miller E.J. Rhodes R.K. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 33-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) or by Pronase (Calbiochem) as described (13Drake M.P. Davison P.F. Bump S. Schmitt F.O. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Pepsin was added directly to the solution of collagen in acetic acid at a ratio of 100 mg of pepsin/1 g of tendons in two doses for 24 h at 4 °C each. For Pronase treatment, solubilized tendons were dialyzed against 0.1m calcium acetate (pH 7.0). Pronase was added to the substrate at a ratio of 1:100 and stirred at 23 °C for 68 h. Aliquots of digested collagen were taken at 20, 44, and 68 h after the reaction was started. The reaction was stopped by addition of an equal volume of 0.5 m acetic acid. AcCol, PepCol, and PronCol were purified by three cycles of salt precipitation and acetic acid resolubilization (23Miller E.J. Rhodes R.K. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 33-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) and stored in 0.5m acetic acid at 4 °C. Samples from each preparation were characterized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (3% stacking gel and 6% separating gel, stained by Coomassie Blue R-250). Collagen concentration in solutions was measured by Sircol assay (Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corp.) and/or by optical absorbance in the 215–230 nm region. Both assays were calibrated using a set of standard collagen solutions of different concentrations. Tyrosine content of collagen was estimated from the optical absorbance at 275.5 nm of collagen denatured in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride following the procedure proposed in Ref. 24Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar. For type I collagen, it was shown previously that this spectroscopic method agrees with direct amino acid analysis within ∼10% (25Chandrakasan G. Torchia D.A. Piez K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6062-6067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Na G.C. Collagen Relat. Res. 1988; 8: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The kinetics of fiber formation and equilibrium solubility of collagen at 32 °C were measured as described (22Kuznetsova N. Chi S.L. Leikin S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11888-11895Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, collagen was dialyzed against 2 mmHCl (pH 2.7). Aliquots from dialyzed collagen solutions (0.5–1.5 mg/ml) were mixed 1:1 on ice with 2× initiation buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate and 0.26 m NaCl with pH adjusted to give pH 7.4 in the mixture). The mixture was degassed for 5 min under vacuum and immediately placed into a Jasco V 560 spectrophotometer, where it was maintained at 32 °C. Fibrillogenesis kinetics was monitored by recording the optical density at 450 nm as a function of time. When no further change in the optical density was detected, the precipitate of assembled collagen fibers was spun down from the mixture by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min. Collagen solubility at 32 °C or the percentage of collagen competent to form fibers was evaluated from the protein concentration in the supernatant. The supernatant and precipitate were characterized by SDS-PAGE. Native fibers from rat tail tendons as well as fibers reconstituted from solutions of AcCol, PepCol, and PronCol were used. Native fibers were excised from rat tails, stored in the protease inhibitor buffer as described above, and then directly used for force measurement. Alternatively, fibers were transferred from the protease inhibitor buffer into 0.1 m sodium phosphate and 2m glycerol (pH 7.5), in which they were washed for several days at 4 °C and after that used for force measurement. We refer to the latter fibers as “washed native.” Reconstituted collagen fibers were made by slow concentration of AcCol, PepCol, and PronCol in 0.5 m acetic acid. Each solution was dialyzed at 4 °C in a Pierce Model 500 microdialyzer system until a solid protein film was formed. Dialysis was performed against 50% polyethylene glycol (PEG; average M r 8000; U. S. Biochemical Corp.) solution in 0.5 m acetic acid. The film was further equilibrated in 40–50 weight % solution of PEG 8000 in 10 mm Tris and 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.5) for 2–3 days at 4 °C, washed in the same buffer to remove PEG, and air-dried at 4 °C. It was shown previously that such reconstituted films, prepared either from AcCol or from PepCol, consist of densely packed, native-like collagen fibers (20Leikin S. Rau D.C. Parsegian V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The films were cut into small pieces (∼1 × 0.5 × 0.5 mm) and prehydrated in 10 mm Tris and 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.5) at 4 °C for at least 1 day to ensure more reproducible measurements of interaxial distances. However, this procedure resulted in the loss of integrity and, apparently, partial solubilization of films made from PronCol treated with the enzyme for 44 and 68 h. Thus, we had to skip the prehydration step for the latter samples. Forces between helices in fibers were measured as a function of interaxial distance by the osmotic stress technique and x-ray diffraction (18Rau D.C. Lee B. Parsegian V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2621-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 19Parsegian V.A. Rand R.P. Fuller N.L. Rau D.C.

Native fibers or pieces of reconstituted films were equilibrated for at least 1 week in gravimetrically prepared PEG 8000 solutions (2–50 weight % PEG in 10 mm Tris and 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.5)) at 5, 20, or 35 °C in tightly sealed 1.5-ml microtubes fitted with O-rings. The solutions were refreshed in the middle of the equilibration (after the first 2–3 days). Each equilibrated sample was sealed in a specially designed cell with a small amount of the solution and placed into an FR590 x-ray diffractometer (Enraf Nonius), where it was maintained at the corresponding temperature during the measurement. This diffractometer was optimized for mid-angle x-ray diffraction (Δq ∼ 0.05-Å−1 resolution in reciprocal space). Details of the design of the x-ray equipment were as described (20Leikin S. Rau D.C. Parsegian V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 21Leikin S. Rau D.C. Parsegian V.A. Nat. Struct.

Tipton H. Parsegian V.A. Rau D.C. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1987; 58: 2110-2114Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The lowest order Bragg spacing (d Br) for lateral packing of the helices was measured, and interaxial distance (d int) was calculated from it in the approximation of hexagonal packing (d int = 2d Br/√3). PEG, because of its large size, does not penetrate inside collagen fibers, whereas water inside fibers freely exchanges with surrounding solution (20Leikin S. Rau D.C. Parsegian V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 21Leikin S. Rau D.C. Parsegian V.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 28Kuznetsova N. Rau D.C. Parsegian V.A. Leikin S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 353-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As a result, PEG osmotically compresses fibers. This action of PEG is counteracted by interaction between collagen helices in fibers that is responsible for fiber swelling. From thermodynamic analysis of this force balance, it was shown that the corresponding force between helices (f) per unit of their length is given by (18Rau D.C. Lee B. Parsegian V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2621-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) f = ΠPEG d int/√3, provided that lateral packing of collagen can be approximated by a hexagonal lattice and interactions between collagen helices are pairwise additive. After force measurement, at least three samples of each collagen were reequilibrated in 6% PEG in 10 mm Tris and 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.5) and sealed in the same x-ray cell as for force measurement. The samples were exposed overnight in an Elliot GX-13 x-ray diffractometer equipped with a 100-μm focusing cup, a multilayer x-ray lens (45-cm focal length; Osmic), and a single set of slits placed immediately after the lens. Diffraction patterns were captured on CRST-VN image plates (Fuji) and read using a BAS2500 image plate scanner (Fuji). The sample-to-plate distance was ∼40 cm. The size of the x-ray beam at the focal spot on the plate was ∼200 × 320 μm. The resolution was estimated as Δq ∼ 0.003 Å−1. The lowest measurable scattering vector q was ∼0.04–0.05 Å−1. This could not be improved due to limitations associated with the design of the x-ray lens. However, such resolution was sufficient for the purpose of this work. We evaluated integrity of collagen molecules by SDS-PAGE and by estimating the number of tyrosine residues/molecule from UV absorption spectra. We assumed that rat tail tendon collagen is similar to mouse type I collagen, whose complete primary sequence is known (29Phillips C.L. Morgan A.L. Lever L.W. Wenstrup R.J. Genomics. 1992; 13: 1345-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30Li S.W. Khillan J. Prockop D.J. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 593-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Based on the mouse sequence (α1(I) chain: CA11_MOUSE, Swiss-Prot accession number P11087; and α2(I) chain: CA21_MOUSE, Swiss-Prot accession number Q01149), one expects an intact molecule to contain 14 tyrosines: 12 in telopeptides and 2 in the triple helical region of the α2(I) chain. Judging from SDS-PAGE, AcCol that did not undergo any enzymatic treatment contained α1(I) and α2(I) chains along with higher molecular weight complexes (Fig. 1,lane 1). The complexes are due to covalent cross-links between two telopeptide chains of the same molecule or between a telopeptide on one molecule and a helical domain on another molecule (9Eyre D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 717-748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yamauchi M. Mechanic G.L. Nimni M.E. Collagen. I. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1988: 157-172Google Scholar). From UV absorption at 275 nm, the number of tyrosine residues in AcCol was estimated as ∼10 (Table I). Apparently, some AcCol molecules had damaged telopeptides.Table INumber of tyrosine residues in acid-soluble and enzymatically treated collagens estimated from UV absorption spectraCollagenEstimated average No. of Tyr residues/moleculeaThe values were obtained using a 1500m−1 cm−1 extinction coefficient for Tyr at 275.5 nm, as described (24). For type I collagen, this spectroscopic method agrees with direct amino acid analysis within ∼10% (25, 26). In our case, the most likely source of error was base-line subtraction. For AcCol, PepCol, and 20-h PronCol, the uncertainty in base-line subtraction did not exceed 20%. For 44- and 68-h PronCol, the base-line subtraction was unreliable, and only upper bounds for the tyrosine content could be estimated.AcCol10 ± 2PepCol5 ± 120-h PronCol2.3 ± 0.544-h PronCol<1.668-h PronCol<1.2a The values were obtained using a 1500m−1 cm−1 extinction coefficient for Tyr at 275.5 nm, as described (24Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar). For type I collagen, this spectroscopic method agrees with direct amino acid analysis within ∼10% (25Chandrakasan G.

In our case, the most likely source of error was base-line subtraction. For AcCol, PepCol, and 20-h PronCol, the uncertainty in base-line subtraction did not exceed 20%. For 44- and 68-h PronCol, the base-line subtraction was unreliable, and only upper bounds for the tyrosine content could be estimated. Open table in a new tab The pepsin treatment of collagen removed higher molecular weight complexes and reduced the molecular weight of α1(I) and α2(I) chains (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1 and 2). It is believed that this is due to partial cleavage of non-helical telopeptides (13Drake M.P. Davison P.F. Bump S. Schmitt F.O. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 14Leibovich S.J. Weiss J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 214: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 31Weiss J.B. Int. Rev. Connect. Tissue Res. 1976; 7: 101-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observed decrease in the number of tyrosines/molecule from ∼10 in AcCol to ∼5 in PepCol supports this interpretation, as previously shown (26Na G.C. Collagen Relat. Res. 1988; 8: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). After 20 h of Pronase treatment (20-h PronCol), the major α1 and α2 bands on SDS-PAGE were similar to those in PepCol (Fig. 1, comparelanes 2 and 3). From UV absorption, we found ∼2 tyrosines/20-h PronCol molecule. Most likely, these are the tyrosines located within the triple helical domain of the α2 chain. Apparently, all telopeptide tyrosines are removed by 20 h of Pronase treatment, including those at the interface between the triple helix and carboxyl-terminal telopeptides. This indicates complete telopeptide digestion, in agreement with previous reports (12Helseth D.L. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7118-7128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Drake M.P. Davison P.F. Bump S. Schmitt F.O. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 32Davison P.F. Drake M.P. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In contrast to pepsin, Pronase treatment led to two additional bands that appeared on the gel close to the α1 and α2 bands. Evidently, Pronase not only digests telopeptides, but also cleaves collagen at some specific site that lies within the triple helical domain. These bands must be products of the cleavage of the α1 and α2 chains, and we designated the bands as α1′ and α2′, respectively. This is consistent with earlier observations that Pronase slowly cleaves collagen even after complete digestion of telopeptides (13Drake M.P. Davison P.F. Bump S. Schmitt F.O. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 32Davison P.F. Drake M.P. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Longer Pronase digestion (44 h (Fig. 1, lane 5) and 68 h (lane 7)) led to intensification of the α1′ and α2′ bands and to the appearance of two more bands labeled as α1″ and α2″. The latter bands most likely result from cleavage of the α1 and α2 chains at yet another site within the triple helical domain. The tyrosine content of collagen was further reduced to <2/molecule (Table I), apparently because of tyrosine removal together with a chunk of collagen triple helix at the carboxyl-terminal end. The kinetics of AcCol, PepCol, and PronCol self-assembly are shown in Fig. 2 a (at 0.3–0.8 mg/ml collagen and 10 mm phosphate in the fibrillogenesis buffer). We used higher collagen and lower phosphate concentrations than in traditional protocols (3Williams B.R. Gelman R.A. Poppke D.C. Piez K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253 (and references therein): 6578-6585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Comper W.D. Veis A. Biopolymers. 1977; 16: 2113-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 12Helseth D.L. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7118-7128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to accelerate fiber nucleation. (Note that phosphate is a potent fibrillogenesis inhibitor (3Williams B.R. Gelman R.A. Poppke D.C. Piez K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253 (and references therein): 6578-6585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kuznetsova N. Chi S.L. Leikin S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11888-11895Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).) Even at these conditions, we did not achieve equilibrium for 44- and 68-h PronCol samples. We found that Pronase treatment substantially increased the fibrillogenesis lag time (nucleation time) compared with AcCol and PepCol, consistent with previously reported data (11Comper W.D. Veis A. Biopolymers. 1977; 16: 2113-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 12Helseth D.L. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7118-7128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we also found that the lag time changed drastically only after prolonged (>20 h) Pronase treatment, i.e. only when digestion of triple helical domains became pronounced. After each kinetic experiment (24 h), we separated assembled fibers and the soluble fraction by centrifugation and measured collagen concentration in the soluble fraction. A significant amount of collagen may be present in this fraction either because collagen becomes assembly-incompetent (as a result of enzymatic cleavage) or because fibrillogenesis is incomplete even after 24 h (as a result of very slow kinetics). We found that virtually all AcCol and PepCol assembled into fibers, with only trace amounts remaining in the soluble fraction. Thus, the equilibrium solubility of assembly-competent collagen is negligibly small. After 20 h of Pronase treatment, the kinetics was still sufficiently fast (Fig. 2 a) so that fiber assembly was complete at the time of fraction separation and concentration measurement (24 h). Thus, in equilibrium, ∼80% of 20-h PronCol formed fibers, whereas the remaining protein stayed in solution. As indicated by SDS-PAGE, 20-h PronCol contained some molecules with cleaved triple helical regions (Fig. 1, lane 3). The soluble fraction consisted virtually only of damaged molecules that had the cleaved α1′ and α2′ chains instead of the normal α1 and α2 chains (Fig. 1, lane 4). The fraction of assembly-competent collagen decreased with the length of Pronase treatment as shown in Fig. 2 b. This coincided with enhancement of the α1′ and α2′ bands and the appearance of the α1″ and α2″ bands on SDS-PAGE of PronCol (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 7). Long Pronase treatment (44 and 68 h) resulted in extremely slow fibrillogenesis kinetics so that the process was not complete after 24 h. Thus, although the soluble protein fraction contained primarily α1′, α1″, α2′, and α2″ chains, it also had some intact α1 and α2 chains (Fig. 1, lanes 6 and8). To assess changes in structure and interaction between collagen molecules in fibers, we prepared reconstituted protein films as described under “Materials and Methods.” The structure of these films can be determined by comparing their small-angle x-ray diffraction patterns with a similar pattern from native rat tail tendons, as shown in Fig. 3. In native tendon fibers, a characteristic set of multiple reflections can be clearly seen (Fig. 3, curve a). These reflections are higher orders of diffraction arising from d = 670-Å axial periodicity in collagen fibers. The positions of maxima in theq-space are given by q(n) = 2πn/d, where n is the order of the diffraction and q is the scattering vector. Note that the 5th, 9th, 12th, 20th, and 21st orders are significantly stronger than their neighboring peaks. This pattern is a signature of the native D-stagger of collagen molecules (4Eikenberry E.F. Brodsky B. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 144: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 6Brodsky B.

The small-angle diffraction pattern from reconstituted AcCol films (Fig. 3, curve b) is very similar to the pattern from native fibers in terms of both positions and relative intensities of the diffraction peaks, consistent with what was reported previously (4Eikenb"

In the present studies we have explored the function of the LIM domain of Lhx2 in stimulating α-subunit transcription. When fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, the LIM domain of Lhx2 was shown to contain a transcriptional activation domain. Furthermore, in the context of an α-subunit reporter gene in which a GAL4-binding site replaced the pituitary glycoprotein basal element, the LIM domain enhanced both basal and Ras-mediated transcription. In addition, a synergistic response to Ras activation was observed when the Lhx2 LIM domain and the transactivation domain of Elk1 are directed to a minimal reporter gene. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified the recently described melanocyte-specific gene-related gene 1 (MRG1) as an Lhx2 LIM-interacting protein.

LIM homeodomain factors appear to play a role in both basal and GnRH-stimulated expression of the glycoprotein hormone α-subunit gene (1Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Schoderbek W.E. Roberson M.S. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3903-3910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial studies demonstrated that LIM homeodomain factor-2 (Lhx2, also designated LH-2) can bind to a pituitary-specific enhancer element designated the PGBE of the mouse α-subunit gene (1Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because both the PGBE and a separate, structurally distinct DNA element designated the GnRH-RE are required for GnRH responsiveness of the mouse glycoprotein hormone α-subunit promoter (12Schoderbek W.E. Roberson M.S. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3903-3910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the finding that Lhx2 binds to the PGBE implies that this LIM factor plays a role in transcriptional responses to GnRH. It has also been shown that a related LIM factor, Lhx3 (also designated pLIM or LIM3) can also enhance α-subunit gene expression (13Bach I. Rhodes S.J. Pearse II, R.V. Heinzel T. Gloss B. Scully K.M. Sawchenko P.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2720-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the Lhx3 gene in mouse results in loss of pituitary organogenesis (14Sheng H.Z. Zhadnov A.B. Mosinger Jr., B. Fujii T. Bertuzzi S. Grinberg A. Lee E.J. Huang S.-P. Mahon K.A. Westphal H. Science. 1996; 272: 1004-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), demonstrating that LIM factors also play an important developmental role in the formation of the pituitary. The specific role that the LIM domains play in transcriptional activation is somewhat unclear. The LIM domain, named for the genes of the first three members of the family, lin-11 (15Freyd G. Kim S.K. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1990; 344: 876-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar),isl-1 (16Karlsson O. Thor S. Norberg T. Ohlsson H. Edlund T. Nature. 1990; 344: 879-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), and mec-3 (17Way J.C. Chalfie M. Cell. 1988; 54: 5-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), is characterized by the presence of two zinc finger motifs that involve cysteine and histidine or aspartate residues that tetrahedrally coordinate a zinc atom (18Archer V.E.V. Breton J. Sanchez-Garcia I. Osada H. Forster A. Thomson A.J. Rabbits T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Pérez-Alvarado G.C. Kosa J.L. Louis H.A. Beckerle M.C. Winge D.R. Summers M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 153-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). There is evidence that some LIM domains can inhibit DNA binding of the associated homeodomain (20Sánchez-Garcı́a I. Osada H. Forster A. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4243-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Taira M. Jamrich M. Good P.J. Dawid I.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 356-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 22Taira M. Otani H. Saint-Jeannet J.-P. Dawid I.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This would suggest that the LIM domain may negatively regulate LIM factor activity. However, it is not clear that inhibition of DNA binding is a general phenomenon for LIM factors (23Gong Z. Hew C.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15149-15158Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Functional studies of Xlim-1 in Xenopus laevis have shown that deletion or mutation of the LIM domain of Xlim-1 results in the induction of secondary axis formation, whereas the wild type factor has no effect (24Agulnick A.D. Taira M. Breen J.J. Tanaka T. Dawid I.B. Westphal H. Nature. 1996; 384: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). This has been interpreted as evidence for a negative role for the LIM domain in regulating transcription. However, in the absence of more mechanistic information about Xlim-1 action, other interpretations are possible. In contrast to the view that LIM domains play a negative role in regulating DNA binding and transcription, some LIM factors have been shown to demonstrate synergistic transcriptional activation with other transcription factors (13Bach I. Rhodes S.J. Pearse II, R.V. Heinzel T. Gloss B. Scully K.M. Sawchenko P.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2720-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 25Johnson J.D. Zhang W. Rudnick A. Rutter W.J. German M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3488-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Recently, a putative co-activator was identified independently in several labs that binds to members of the LIM homeodomain protein family and nuclear LIM only proteins (24Agulnick A.D. Taira M. Breen J.J. Tanaka T. Dawid I.B. Westphal H. Nature. 1996; 384: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 26Jurata L.W. Kenny D.A. Gill G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1370-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This LIM-binding protein has been termed NLI (nuclear LIMinteractor), LIM domain-binding factor and cofactor of LIM domain proteins. It has been suggested that NLI may have a positive effect on transcription by relieving the inhibitory effects of the LIM domain in the context of the full-length Xlim-1 in vivo(28Breen J.J. Agulnick A.D. Westphal H. Dawid I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4712-4717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, NLI has also been shown to inhibit the synergy between the LIM homeodomain factor Lmx-1 and the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, E47 (29Jurata L. Gill G.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5688-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus, like the LIM domain itself, it is not yet clear whether NLI plays a positive or negative role in mediating or regulating LIM factor function. In the present studies we sought to further define the function of the LIM domain of Lhx2 in the transcription of the glycoprotein α-subunit gene. We have shown the LIM domain of Lhx2 is sufficient to activate transcription when directed to the PGBE of the α-promoter. Furthermore, we have identified a LIM-interacting transcriptional activator, MRG1, that is capable of mediating enhanced transcription of the α-promoter. Luciferase reporter genes containing the −507 to +46 region of the mouse glycoprotein hormone α-subunit gene or the −507 to −205 region linked to a minimal promoter have been described previously (12Schoderbek W.E. Roberson M.S. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3903-3910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Schoderbek W.E. Kim K.E. Ridgway E.C. Mellon P.L. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 893-903PubMed Google Scholar). The PGBE and GnRH-RE mutant α-subunit luciferase reporter genes were constructed by subcloning double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the GAL4-binding site, GGAAGACTCTCCTCCG, into the NotI restriction site of the previously described block PGBE and GnRH-RE mutant α-subunit promoter constructs (30Schoderbek W.E. Kim K.E. Ridgway E.C. Mellon P.L. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 893-903PubMed Google Scholar). The 5× GAL4-binding site luciferase reporter and the GAL4-Elk1 expression constructs have been described previously (31Roberson M.S. Misra-Press A. Laurance M.E. Stork P.J.S. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3531-3539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant GAL4-Elk1 S383A expression vector was constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using standard techniques to remove a major MAPK phosphorylation site (32Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). To prepare GAL4-LIM domain and GAL4-NLI expression constructs, the appropriate coding regions were isolated by polymerase chain amplification and subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) containing the GAL4(1–147) DNA-binding domain downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter (33Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). For construction of an MRG1 expression vector, the complete coding sequence for MRG1 was isolated by polymerase chain reaction amplification from αT3–1 cell cDNA using primers based on the known sequence (34Shioda T. Fenner M.H. Isselbacher K.J. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 204: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and the coding sequence was cloned into pcDNA3. The Lhx2 LIM and MRG1 maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion constructs were generated by subcloning appropriate fragments into the bacterial expression vector pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs). αT3–1 and NS20Y cells were maintained in monolayer culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). For transient transfection assays cells were plated in 6-well plates 24 h prior to transfection and then treated with a suspension of 5–10 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1–3 μg of total DNA in 1 ml of serum-free OPTI-MEMI (Life Technologies, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After a 12–14-h incubation, an equal volume of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum was added to the transfected cells. 6 h later the cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity (35de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar). To assess transfection efficiency, cells were transfected with a cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase reporter gene (36MacGregor G.R. Caskey C.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), and β-galactosidase activity was determined and used to normalize luciferase light units. To prepare a VP16- αT3–1 cDNA fusion library, duplex cDNA was prepared using RNA prepared from αT3–1 cells and reagents from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech following the manufacturer's recommendations. The cDNA termini were modified by ligation to an adapter containing aNotI restriction site, and then the cDNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. The amplified cDNA was digested with NotI and subcloned into the NotI site downstream of the VP16 activation domain in the yeast two-hybrid library vector, VP16 (37Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). A modified bait vector, BTMYeA, 2P. Goldman, unpublished data. which allows expression of both a LexA fusion and a second protein, was used for the two-hybrid screen. The LIM domain of Lhx2 (residues 42–182) was isolated by the polymerase chain reaction and subcloned intoEcoRI and BamHI sites, which are downstream of the LexA DNA-binding domain of BTMYeA. NLI was cloned downstream of the ADH promoter of the BTMYeA. The strategy of expression of both the LexA-Lhx2 LIM fusion protein and NLI was based on the possible identification of factors that interact with the LIM-NLI complex. However, subsequent analysis of the factors that were isolated in the screen demonstrated that none of the LIM-binding factors were dependent on NLI for binding. The bait and cDNA library plasmids were transformed into the L40 yeast strain (MATa his3Δ200 trp1-901 leu2-3, 112 ade2 LYS2:: (lexAop) 4 -His3 URA3::(lexAop) 8 -lacZ GAL4 gal80) (37Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) and selected for positive, interacting clones using histidine minus medium in the presence of 30 mm 3-aminotriazole to suppress the background activity of the bait. Further selection was performed on histidine minus medium containing 50 mm3-aminotriazole. For immunoprecipitation studies, αT3–1 cells were cultured in 150-mm2 plates and transfected using LipofectAMINE with either pcDNA3 or pcDNA3 directing the expression of FLAG epitope-tagged Lhx2 as described above. 48 h after transfection the cells were collected, and nuclei were isolated and extracted as described previously (1Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were incubated with M2 FLAG antibody immobilized on agarose beads (Kodak) overnight at 4 °C and subsequently washed five times in 1 ml each of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma). The immunoprecipitates were resolved on a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semi-dry transfer apparatus following the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Lhx2 and Lhx3 were detected using polyclonal antibodies. The Lhx2 antibody was prepared by immunizing rabbits with a glutathioneS-transferase fusion to a fragment of the coding sequence of mouse Lhx2. The antibody to mouse Lhx3 was a generous gift of Dr. S. Pfaff (38Sharma K. Sheng H.Z. Lettieri K. Li H. Karavanov A. Potter S. Westphal H. Pfaff S.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 817-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). MRG1 was detected using a polyclonal antibody to MRG1 at a dilution of 1:1000, a generous gift of T. Shioda. GAL4 fusion proteins were detected using monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz). Immunoblots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma), followed by detection with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (NEN Life Science Products). MBP fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli grown at 30 °C and immobilized on amylose resin as described (39Bedouelle H. Duplay P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In vitro binding reactions were performed in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20. Radiolabeled proteins for analysis of binding were generated by in vitro transcription using bacteriophage SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase (40Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nuc. Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar) and translation in a reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine using reagents from Promega. FLAG epitope-tagged p300 was expressed and purified from baculovirus. After incubation of the binding reactions for 2 h at 4 °C, the resin was washed 5 × 1 ml in the binding buffer. Bound proteins were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide denaturing gels and visualized by autoradiography or by Western blotting using the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody as described above. Previous studies from this laboratory have provided evidence that Lhx2 can bind to the PGBE of the α-subunit gene and stimulate α-subunit promoter activity (1Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Lhx2 cDNA was isolated from a library prepared from the gonadotrope derived, αT3–1 cell line (41Windle J.J. Weiner R.I. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), and this cell line was confirmed to contain Lhx2 mRNA (1Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently it has been shown that αT3–1 cells also contain Lhx3 mRNA and that Lhx3 can also activate the α-subunit promoter (13Bach I. Rhodes S.J. Pearse II, R.V. Heinzel T. Gloss B. Scully K.M. Sawchenko P.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2720-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). These separate studies raise the possibility that both Lhx2 and Lhx3 may contribute to activation of the α-subunit gene. To further explore this possibility we examined the expression of Lhx2 and Lhx3 in αT3–1 cells at the protein level. Immunoblots demonstrated that both Lhx2 and Lhx3 are indeed present in extracts of αT3–1 cells (Fig. 1 A). The ability of these LIM factors to activate the α-subunit promoter in heterologous cells was then compared (Fig. 1 B). Expression vectors for Lhx2 and Lhx3 were both able to stimulate expression of an α-subunit reporter gene. Interestingly, deletion of the LIM domain of Lhx2 eliminated activation of the α-subunit reporter gene. Although the role that the LIM domain plays in transcriptional activation has been somewhat controversial, these findings provide evidence that within this specific context, the LIM domain of Lhx2 is necessary for transcriptional activation. The findings that both Lhx2 and Lhx3 are present in αT3–1 cells and that both factors can activate the α-subunit promoter provide evidence that both Lhx2 and Lhx3 may play a role in α-subunit regulation in this cell line. In the present studies we have focused our attention on further characterization of Lhx2. However, it should be noted that both Lhx2 and Lhx3 appear to contribute to transcription of the α-subunit gene. The preceding experiments offered evidence that the LIM domain of Lhx2 may contain a transcriptional activation domain. To directly evaluate the transcriptional activation potential of the LIM domain of Lhx2, we constructed expression vectors in which the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain was fused to the LIM domain of Lhx2. The activity of the GAL4-LIM fusion constructs was assessed by transfection of αT3–1 cells. Transcription of the α-subunit gene in these cells is stimulated by GnRH (12Schoderbek W.E. Roberson M.S. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3903-3910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) through a pathway that involves activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (31Roberson M.S. Misra-Press A. Laurance M.E. Stork P.J.S. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3531-3539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present studies we have used an expression vector for constitutively active Ras (42Shih C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1982; 29: 161-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) to activate MAPK and stimulate α-subunit transcription. In the initial studies, a reporter gene containing five copies of a GAL4-binding site upstream of a minimal promoter linked to luciferase was used to assess the ability of the GAL4-Lhx2 LIM construct to activate transcription (Fig. 2 A). We found that the GAL4-Lhx2 LIM construct stimulated reporter gene expression and that reporter gene activity was not further stimulated by Ras (Fig. 2 B). Similar results were obtained using a GAL4-Lhx3 LIM construct (data not shown). Thus, when tested with this simple reporter gene, the Lhx2 LIM domain appears to contain a transcriptional activation domain that is not responsive to the MAPK pathway. To examine the specificity of activation, we prepared a GAL4 fusion with muscle LIM protein (MLP). MLP has been shown to bind to the actin cytoskeleton (43Arber S. Halder G. Caroni P. Cell. 1994; 79: 221-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 44Arber S. Caroni P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and enhance myogenesis (43Arber S. Halder G. Caroni P. Cell. 1994; 79: 221-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 45King Y. Flick M.J. Kudla A.J. Konieczny S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4750-4760Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The GAL4-MLP construct had very little effect on reporter gene activity. Thus, transcriptional activation is a property of the LIM domain of the nuclear transcription factor, Lhx2, which is not shared with the LIM domain of MLP. It is likely that structural differences in these LIM domains leads to unique protein-protein interactions mediating different responses. To determine whether the transcription-stimulating activity of the Lhx2 LIM domain was dependent on the intact structure of the LIM domain, cysteine residues 52 and 55, which are involved in zinc binding (18Archer V.E.V. Breton J. Sanchez-Garcia I. Osada H. Forster A. Thomson A.J. Rabbits T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Pérez-Alvarado G.C. Kosa J.L. Louis H.A. Beckerle M.C. Winge D.R. Summers M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 153-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), were mutated to alanine. This mutation, which presumably disrupts the structure of the LIM domain, was found to substantially decrease reporter gene activity. All of the GAL4 fusion proteins were expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 2 C). We also assessed the ability of the LIM domains of Lhx2 to activate transcription in the context of the α-subunit promoter. For these studies the wild type PGBE element of α-subunit promoter was replaced with one copy of a GAL4-binding site (Fig. 2 D). This allowed GAL4-LIM fusion proteins to be directed to the mutated PGBE in transient transfection studies. As described previously (31Roberson M.S. Misra-Press A. Laurance M.E. Stork P.J.S. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3531-3539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), expression of the wild type α-subunit reporter gene was induced severalfold by activated Ras (Fig. 2 E). Consistent with previous studies (1Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), replacement of the PGBE with a GAL4-binding site reduced basal expression of the α-subunit reporter gene and also reduced the ability of activated Ras to stimulate reporter gene expression in the absence of the GAL4-Lhx2 LIM domain construct (data not shown). Neither the GAL4 DNA-binding domain alone nor the GAL4-MLP fusion were able to activate basal expression or support a Ras response (Fig. 2 F). In contrast, the GAL4-Lhx2 LIM fusion construct increased basal reporter gene activity and also supported a Ras response that is similar in magnitude to that obtained with the wild type α-subunit construct (Fig. 2, compare E andF). The ability of the GAL4-Lhx2 LIM construct to permit a Ras response with the α-subunit reporter is in contrast to failure of this same construct to support a Ras response with the simple 5× GAL4 reporter (Fig. 2 B). This observation suggests that within the context of the α-subunit gene, the Lhx2 LIM domain cooperates with other factors to enhance the response to Ras and activation of MAPK. The activity of the GAL4-Lhx2 LIM construct was dependent on an intact LIM structure as mutation of crucial cysteine residues within the one zinc finger greatly reduced both basal and Ras-stimulated reporter gene activity. We also compared the ability of the LIM domain of Lhx2 and Lhx3 to activate the modified α-subunit reporter gene (Fig. 2 G). Expression of GAL4-LIM domain fusions of both Lhx2 and Lhx3 allowed Ras-induced activation of the α-subunit reporter gene (Fig. 2 G). Because both cytoplasmic and nuclear LIM domains have been shown to function as protein-protein interaction domains (46Jurata L.W. Gill G.N. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 75-113PubMed Google Scholar, 47Dawid I.B. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 156-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), it seems likely that the LIM domain of Lhx2 functions as a transcriptional activation domain through recruiting other factors to the α-subunit gene. As an initial characterization of this possibility, we sought to determine whether the Lhx2 LIM domain could inhibit α-subunit expression (Fig. 3). For these studies, the wild type α-subunit reporter gene was co-transfected with the GAL4-LIM constructs. Because the wild type α-subunit reporter gene does not contain GAL4-binding sites, we anticipated that any effects of the GAL4 fusion proteins would be indirect through sequestration of specific proteins. Transfection of GAL4-Lhx2 LIM domain vector substantially inhibited Ras-induced expression of the α-subunit reporter in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3 A). Comparable effects were seen for the GAL4-Lhx3 LIM construct but not the Lhx2 LIM mutant (data not shown). This effect was specific for the α-subunit reporter because the GAL4-Lhx2 LIM construct had little or no effect on the thymidine kinase promoter (Fig. 3 B). Similarly, an expression vector for GAL4-MLP had no effect on α-subunit gene expression (data not shown), again indicating the specificity of this effect. To further define the structure-function relationship for the Lhx2 LIM domain, the effects of GAL4 fusion constructs containing the individual LIM domains, designated LIM1 and LIM2, were al"

Purified TrwBΔN70 protein bound tightly the fluorescent ATP analogue TNP-ATP (K s = 8.7 μm) but did not show measurable ATPase or GTPase activity. A single ATP binding site was found per TrwB monomer. An intact ATP-binding site was essential for R388 conjugation, since a TrwB mutant with a single amino acid alteration in the ATP-binding signature (K136T) was transfer-deficient. TrwBΔN70 also bound DNA nonspecifically. DNA binding enhanced TrwC nic cleavage, providing the first evidence that directly links TrwB with conjugative DNA processing. Since DNA bound by TrwBΔN70 also showed increased negative superhelicity (as shown by increased sensitivity to topoisomerase I), nic cleavage enhancement was assumed to be a consequence of the increased single-stranded nature of DNA aroundnic. The mutant protein TrwB(K136T)ΔN70 was indistinguishable from TrwBΔN70 with respect to the above properties, indicating that TrwB ATP binding activity is not required for them. The reported properties of TrwB suggest potential functions for conjugative coupling proteins, both as triggers of conjugative DNA processing and as motors in the transport process.

Bacterial Conjugation. Plenum Press, New York1993Crossref Google Scholar, 2Lanka E. Wilkins B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 141-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 3Wilkins B.M. Bates S. NATO ASI Ser. Ser. H Cell Biol. 1998; 103: 43-64Google Scholar). Conjugative DNA transfer requires two sets of plasmid-encoded proteins called Dtr and Mpf proteins (4Pansegrau W. Lanka E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 197-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dtr proteins process conjugative DNA through formation of a nucleoprotein complex, the relaxosome, that cleaves and unwinds DNA, thus creating the single DNA strand to be transferred (T-strand). The relaxosome moves to the transport site, and the DNA transport apparatus (formed by the Mpf proteins) transfers the T-strand to the recipient cell. Plasmid R388 has the shortest known mobilization region (5Bolland S. Llosa M. Avila P. de la Cruz F. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5795-5802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only three plasmid encoded proteins, TrwA, TrwB, and TrwC, together withoriT, are involved in R388 mobilization (6Llosa M. Bolland S. de la Cruz F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 448-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). TrwC acts as a relaxase as well as a helicase, and both activities are involved inoriT cleavage and unwinding of R388 T-strand (7Grandoso G. Llosa M. Zabala J.C. de la Cruz F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8Llosa M. Grandoso G. de la Cruz F. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The relaxase activity is localized in the 350 N-terminal amino acids of TrwC, while the DNA helicase activity is localized in the C-terminal domain of the protein (9Llosa M. Grandoso G. Hernando M.A. de la Cruz F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 56-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). TrwA is a small, tetrameric protein with a dual role in conjugation. By its binding to two sites at R388 plasmidoriT, TrwA enhances TrwC relaxase activity while repressing transcription of the trwABC operon (10Moncalián G. Grandoso G. Llosa M. de la Cruz F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). R388 relaxosome is composed of TrwA and TrwC bound to oriT DNA together with the host protein IHF. The latter inhibits TrwC nic cleavage by affecting the topology of the DNA site where TrwC has to act. By so doing, it is thought to modulate R388 conjugation (11Moncalián G. Valle M. Valpuesta J.M. de la Cruz F. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The third plasmid-encoded protein necessary for R388 conjugative DNA processing is TrwB. TrwB sequence analysis predicts an integral membrane protein containing the characteristic NTP-binding motifs and belonging to the TraG protein family (6Llosa M. Bolland S. de la Cruz F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 448-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Further genetic studies have shown that TraG could substitute for TrwB in mobilization of ColE1 and RSF1010 plasmids by R388 but not in self-transfer of R388 (12Cabezón E. Lanka E. de la Cruz F. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4455-4458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other experiments demonstrated that TrwB interacts specifically with both the relaxosome and the DNA transport complex and that the frequency of mobilization should be the result of the combined interactions of TrwB, the relaxosome, and the DNA transport complex (13Cabezón E. Sastre J.I. de la Cruz F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 14Santini J.M. Stanisch V.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4093-4101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we were interested in the molecular mechanism that allows TrwB protein to couple the relaxosome to the DNA transport complex. When the amino acid sequence of TraD, the TraG homologue of plasmid F, is compared with TrwB, it shows a C-terminal extension that adds specificity and efficiency to F plasmid transfer (15Sastre J.I. Cabezón E. de la Cruz F. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6039-6042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein TraD is up to now the only TraG-like protein purified and subjected to biochemical analysis. Its binding to a DNA-linked agarose column suggested interactions between TraD and DNA, although this suggestion could not be substantiated by experimental evidence (16Panicker M.M. Minkley Jr., E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12761-12766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro assays show that TraD binds to protein TraM; thus, TraD is suggested to interact with the relaxosome via TraM (17Disqué-Kochem C. Dreiseikelmann B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6133-6137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The poverty of in vitro results obtained with TraG-like proteins could be a reflection of the difficulty in handling integral membrane proteins for biochemical analysis. In order to solve this problem, we have designed a TrwB derivative only containing its cytoplasmic domain, by deletion of the 70-amino acid N-terminal fragment that contains the two predicted transmembrane α-helices (6Llosa M. Bolland S. de la Cruz F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 448-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We analyze in this article the ATP and DNA binding properties of TrwBΔN70. Our prediction that the soluble domain of TrwB would interact with the relaxosome has been fulfilled by demonstration of enhanced nic cleavage in the presence of TrwBΔN70. The ATP binding activity is essential for transfer but not for DNA binding or other transactions with the relaxosome.

Open table in a new tab For protein TrwBΔN70 purification, a fresh saturated culture of BL21::DE3 (pSU4637) was diluted 20-fold in 1 liter of YT medium (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing ampicillin (100 mg/liter) and incubated at 37 °C with shaking untilA 550 = 0.6. Then isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 4 h of further incubation, bacteria were harvested and resuspended in 20 ml of 10 mm EDTA, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) buffer. Cells were frozen in dry ice/ethanol and thawed at 37 °C. Lysozyme, benzamidine, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were added to 0.5 mg/ml, 2.5 mm, and 0.8 mm final concentration, respectively. After a 30-min incubation on ice, an equal volume of buffer A (1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmEDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 1 m KCl, was added, and the lysate was centrifuged at 138,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was diluted with buffer A to 0.15 m KCl final concentration and adsorbed to a 10-ml phosphocellulose P11 (Whatman) chromatographic column, equilibrated with buffer A and 0.15m KCl. Bound proteins eluted in a 90-ml linear salt gradient (150 mm to 1 m KCl) in buffer A. TrwBΔN70-containing fractions were pooled and diluted to 0.15m KCl with buffer A (fraction I). Fraction I was loaded on a 5-ml HiTrap-Heparin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with 0.15 m KCl in buffer A. Proteins eluted in a 20-ml linear gradient (150 mm to 1 m KCl) in buffer A. Pooled TrwBΔN70-containing fractions were diluted to 0.15m KCl with buffer A (fraction II). Fraction II was loaded on a 5-ml HiTrap-SP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with 0.15 m KCl in buffer A. Proteins eluted in a 20-ml linear gradient (150 mm to 1 m KCl) in buffer A. TrwBΔN70-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated in a Centricon 10 (Amicon) concentrator (fraction III). Finally, fraction III was loaded on a Superdex 75 HL 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A plus 0.10 m KCl and eluted with 25 ml of the same buffer. TrwBΔN70-containing fractions were pooled (fraction IV). Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 20%, and the protein was stored at −20 °C. Final protein yield was 40 mg. The biochemical activities of TrwBΔN70 reported in this work remained stable for at least 6 months. All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C except HiTrap and gel filtration column chromatography, which were carried out at room temperature. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit and the calculated extinction coefficient of the native protein. TrwBΔN70 N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined by Edman degradation in a model 477A/120A sequencer (Applied Biosystems) at Centro Nacional de Biotecnologı́a (Madrid, Spain). Exactly the same procedure was used to purify the ATP-binding mutant TrwB(K136T)ΔN70, starting from a culture of strain BL21::DE3 (pSU4639). Protein TrwC was purified as described previously (7Grandoso G. Llosa M. Zabala J.C. de la Cruz F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The nucleotide binding properties of TrwBΔN70 and TrwB(K136T)ΔN70 were studied using a fluorescent analogue of ATP, namely TNP-ATP1 (Molecular Probes, Inc.) (23Hiratsuka T. Uchida K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 320: 635-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed at room temperature using a Perkin-Elmer MPF-66 spectrofluorometer, with spectral bandwidths of 5 and 10 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. Proteins were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Measurements were corrected for wavelength dependence on the excitation light intensity by using rhodamine B in the reference channel. All spectra were corrected for buffer fluorescence and for dilution. When extrinsic fluorescence of TNP-ATP was studied, excitation was performed at 410 nm, and emission was scanned in the 470–650-nm range. TNP-ATP binding was determined from the increase in fluorescence at 560 nm in the presence of the test protein. ATP and GTP hydrolysis were analyzed by radioactive and by enzyme-coupled assays, as described previously (24Rivas S. Bolland S. Cabezón E. Goñi F.M. de la Cruz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25583-25590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Bacterial transformation with plasmid DNA was carried out by electroporation (25Dower W.J. Miller J.F. Ragsdale C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6127-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (2170) Google Scholar). For conjugative mating experiments, donor and recipient strains were grown overnight in YT medium with appropriate antibiotics. Then 0.25 ml of donor culture were mixed with 0.25 ml of recipient culture, the mixture was briefly centrifuged, and concentrated bacteria were placed onto a GS Millipore filter (0.22-μm pore size) on a prewarmed YT-agar plate for 1 h at 37 °C. After this period, bacteria were washed from the filter, diluted in 2 ml of YT, and plated on selective media. Conjugation frequencies were expressed as the number of transconjugants/ml. Protein-DNA complexes were prepared by incubation of supercoiled (SC) oriT-containing plasmid pSU1186 DNA with protein TrwBΔN70 either in the absence or in the presence of TrwC or ATP or both. Incubations were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min in 100 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer (supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2 if 1 mm ATP was to be added). Samples were diluted to ≈0.5 μg/ml DNA concentration and fixed by treatment with glutaraldehyde (0.05% final concentration) at 37 °C for 30 min. After fixation, MgCl2 (20 mm final concentration) was added to increase the efficiency of sample adsorption to the mica, and samples were thoroughly washed with Milli Q water. After ethanol dehydration and air drying, the mica-adsorbed samples were subjected to Pt/C shadowing in a Balzers 400T unit. Protein-DNA complexes were shadowed at a 4° angle with a platinum layer (7 nm thick) and further stabilized by a 10-nm-thick carbon layer evaporated on top, at 90° with respect to the plane of the sample. The replicas were then released from the mica and collected over grids to allow their visualization. Alternatively, samples of TrwBΔN70 and TrwBΔN70 with pSU1186 DNA were negatively stained with freshly prepared 2% uranyl acetate on thin carbon-coated collodion grids. All samples were observed in a JEOL 1200 EX-II electron microscope operated at 100 kV. Electron micrographs were recorded on Eastman Kodak Co. SO-163 film. TrwBΔN70 (or TrwB(K136T)ΔN70) was added to reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 200 ng of SC pSU1186 plasmid DNA, 200 ng of SC pUC18 plasmid DNA, or 200 ng of ssM13 DNA in binding buffer (100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)). Mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Then 2 μl of loading buffer (containing 20% sucrose and bromphenol blue) were added to each sample. Reaction mixtures were applied to 0.7% (w/v) agarose gels stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and electrophoresed in TB buffer. After 1 h at 100 V, bands were visualized using the Gel Doc 1000 system and Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 200 ng of SC pSU1186 plasmid DNA in 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. After a 10-min preincubation with increasing amounts of TrwBΔN70 or TrwB(K136T)ΔN70, TrwC (1 μm) was added, and the mixtures were incubated for a further 15 min at 37 °C. Then 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added, and samples were digested for 15 min at 37 °C in reaction buffer supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) SDS. Reaction mixtures were applied to 0.7% (w/v) agarose gels containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and electrophoresed in TB buffer. Cleavage product quantification was carried out after irradiation of the agarose gel with 254-nm UV light to ensure that all DNA species were nicked and intercalated similar amounts of ethidium bromide (26Nelson W.C. Howard M.T. Sherman J.A. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28374-28380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). 1.2 units of calf thymus topoisomerase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) were assayed for relaxation activity in 20 μl of 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer with 200 ng of negatively SC pSU1186 plasmid DNA. After a 10-min preincubation of the DNA with or without TrwBΔN70, topoisomerase I was added, and incubation continued for 10 min at 37 °C. Reaction mixtures were deproteinized by digestion with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 0.5% (w/v) SDS for 15 min at 37 °C. Reaction mixtures were applied to 0.7% (w/v) agarose gels containing or not containing chloroquine (2.5 μg/ml) and electrophoresed in TB buffer for 1 h at 120 V. After electrophoresis, gels were visualized using the Gel Doc 1000 system and Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). Gels without chloroquine were stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide before visualization. TrwBΔN70 was purified from E. coli strain BL21::DE3 (pSU4637). Upon induction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the strain overproduced TrwBΔN70 as a soluble protein that could be purified after sequential P11 phosphocellulose affinity, HiTrap-heparin affinity, HiTrap-SP ion exchange, and gel filtration column chromatography steps. Gel filtration chromatography resulted in the elution of TrwBΔN70 as a single symmetric peak at the position expected for a globular protein of about 15 kDa. This retarded elution may be due to the interaction of TrwBΔN70 with the gel matrix and was not analyzed further. The purification scheme is described under “Experimental Procedures” and summarized in Fig. 1. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified TrwBΔN70 was determined to be NH2-Met-Asn-Ser-Val-Gly-Gln-Gly-Glu-Phe-Gly, as expected from the DNA sequence of the constructed plasmid. Matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time of flight mass spectrometry determined the molecular mass of the protein to be 48,620.5 Da, in accordance with the molecular mass of the predicted 437-amino acid sequence (48,621.5 Da). The extinction coefficient of the denatured TrwBΔN70 protein in 6m guanidine-HCl was calculated to be ε280 = 55,760 m−1 cm−1. From the absorption spectrum of the denatured protein, the concentration of our protein sample was calculated, and from it the extinction coefficient of the native protein was determined to be ε280 = 128,580m−1 cm−1 (as described in Ref.27Lohman T.M. Chao K. Green J.M. Sages S. Runyon G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10139-10147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the extinction coefficients of the native and denatured protein are clearly different. It is known that extinction coefficient increases when Trp, Tyr, Phe, or His amino acids are transferred to a less polar environment. Changes in amino acid polarity are often due to oligomer-monomer transitions in proteins. TrwBΔN70 multimerization was most clearly shown by electron microscopy of negatively stained specimens (Fig. 2 A). Electron micrographs of TrwBΔN70 revealed the presence of large, round particles, 25 nm in diameter, compatible with extensive but regular multimerization of the native protein. The size of the regular aggregates (see Fig. 2 B) suggested a large degree of multimerization (probably more than 20 TrwBΔN70 monomers if a globular diameter of 5 nm is assumed for a 48-kDa protein monomer). However, attempts to process the round images shown in Fig. 2 B by averaging techniques were unsuccessful, due to the inherent bad staining properties of the multimer. Since the protein was most probably eluted as a monomer from gel filtration chromatography, TrwBΔN70 oligomerized either upon the addition of glycerol to stabilized it, upon storage, or during negative staining.FIG. 2Transmission electron microscopy of negatively stained protein TrwBΔN70.

Bolland S. de la Cruz F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 448-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, the N-terminal deletion in TrwBΔN70 is not expected to remove amino acids involved in ATP binding. Nucleotide binding was studied with the fluorescent ATP analogue TNP-ATP (23Hiratsuka T. Uchida K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 320: 635-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Upon protein binding, the fluorescence emission intensity of TNP-ATP increases considerably, and thus it has been widely used to characterize the ATP binding of a number of proteins, mainly ATP hydrolases (28Dupont Y. Chapron Y. Pougeois R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 106: 1272-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 29Watanabe T. Inesi G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3474-3477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Fig. 3shows the increase in fluorescence intensity of TNP-ATP in the presence of TrwBΔN70 (spectrum 3). Binding of TNP-ATP was ATP-specific, since it could be dislodged from its binding site(s) by adding excess ATP (Fig. 3, spectrum 4). The spectra shown in Fig. 3 remained invariant with time for at least 20 min, indicative of a rapid attainment of the binding equilibrium. When TrwBΔN70 binding to TNP-ATP was titrated with increasing concentrations of TNP-ATP, saturation was observed (Fig. 4). The experimental points, corresponding to differences in fluorescence intensity between the bound and the free probe, could be fitted to a Michaelian curve with aK s = 8.7 μm, as shown in Fig. 4 A. This value can be interpreted as the dissociation constant of the protein-nucleotide complex. Thus, TrwBΔN70 bound TNP-ATP with much higher affinity (2–3 orders of magnitude) than usual ATP binding values for ATPases. Nevertheless, high affinity binding of TNP-ATP has been observed in all cases in which this analogue has been used (e.g. Refs. 28Dupont Y. Chapron Y. Pougeois R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 106: 1272-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar and 31Dayan G. Baubichon-Cortay H. Jault J-M. Cortay J.M. Deléage G. Di Pietro A. J. Biol.

Dupont et al. (28Dupont Y. Chapron Y. Pougeois R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 106: 1272-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) analyzed the binding data of TNP-ATP to sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase using an equation described by Gutfreund (33Gutfreund H.

The three known adaptor complexes, AP1, AP2, and AP3, have all been shown to recognize tyrosine- and leucine-based sorting signals, which are the most common sorting signals within membrane protein cytoplasmic tails. Although tyrosine-based signals are recognized by the μ-chains of adaptor complexes, the subunit recognizing leucine-based sorting signals is less clear.In this report we show by surface plasmon resonance that the two leucine-based sorting signals within the cytoplasmic tail of the invariant chain bind independently from each other to AP1 and AP2 but not to AP3. We also show that both motifs can be recognized by the μ-chains of AP1 and AP2. Moreover, by using monomeric as well as trimeric invariant chain constructs, we show that adaptor binding does not require trimerization of the invariant chain.

The invariant chain (Ii), a type II transmembrane protein, associates with MHC class II molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum and prevents binding of immunogenic peptides to these molecules while escorting them to endosomal compartment where antigen-loading may take place (for review, see Refs. 1Germain R.N. Margulies D.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 403-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 2Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 259-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Nordeng T.W.

Nature. 1991; 354: 392-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), which is formed by its luminal domains (5Bijlmakers M.E. Bénaroch P. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8281-8287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis has shown that information contained in the cytoplasmic domain of Ii is necessary and sufficient for targeting of the protein to endosomal/lysosomal compartments (7Bakke O.

Nature. 1990; 348: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis localized two signals in the cytoplasmic tail that independently are able to sort Ii to endocytic compartments; one signal contains a leucine and isoleucine (LI) residues at positions 7 and 8 (9Pieters J. Bakke O. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 831-846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the second contains a methionine and leucine (ML) residues at positions 16 and 17 of the tail (10Bremnes B. Madsen T. Gedde-Dahl M. Bakke O. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2021-2032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Odorizzi C.G. Trowbridge I.S. Xue L. Hopkins C.R. Davis C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Additionally, the signals are part of an α-helix/turn, and acidic residues N-terminal of both sorting motifs are required for efficient sorting (12Motta A. Bremnes B. Morelli M.A.C. Frank R.W. Saviano G. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27165-27171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Pond L. Kuhn L.A. Teyton L. Schutze M.P. Tainer J.A. Jackson M.R. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19989-19997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Whether Ii reaches the endocytic pathway directly from the trans-Golgi network or indirectly via the plasma membrane (PM) by fast internalization is still a matter of debate. A dynamin mutant led to accumulation of MHCII/Ii at the plasma membrane (14Wang K. Peterson P.A. Karlsson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17055-17060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and each of the sorting motifs allowed a fast internalization from the PM (10Bremnes B. Madsen T. Gedde-Dahl M. Bakke O. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2021-2032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Roche P.A. Teletski C.L. Stang E. Bakke O. Long E.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. USA. 1993; 90: 8581-8585Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), suggesting an indirect transport route. On the other hand a direct pathway is supported by the finding that only 20% of a fusion protein with the Ii tail were ever exposed on the cell surface (11Odorizzi C.G. Trowbridge I.S. Xue L. Hopkins C.R. Davis C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and by the observation that the transport of Ii-MHC-II complexes to late endosomes is not inhibited by concanamycin B, which blocks trafficking between early and late endosomes (16Bénaroch P. Yilla M. Raposo G. Ito K. Miwa K. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In conclusion the present data support a dual route to endosomes involving both direct transport and routing via the plasma membrane. Both leucine- and tyrosine-based sorting motifs mediate internalization of membrane proteins from the PM and may sort membrane proteins to endosomes/lysosomes and to the compartment for peptide loading (for review see Refs. 3Nordeng T.W. Gorvel J.-P. Bakke O. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 232: 179-215PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sandoval I.V. Bakke O. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 292-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, and 18Marks M.S. Ohno H. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino S.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Different experimental approaches have shown that the medium chains of the three known adaptor complexes, AP1, AP2, and AP3, recognize tyrosine-based sorting motifs (19Hirst J. Robinson M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 173-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 20Traub L.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 43-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recognition of leucine-based sorting signals by adaptors is less well characterized. It was recently proposed that these signals bind to the β-subunits of AP1 and AP2 (21Rapoport I. Chen Y.C. Cupers P. Shoelson S.E. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2148-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). When peptides containing leucine-based signals and a photoactivable cross-linker were incubated with adaptors, they were found to cross-link to the β-subunits of AP1 and AP2. In addition, also the μ-chains of AP1 and AP2 have been reported to bind to leucine-based signals. This was found using a random phage display library and by incubating recombinant adaptor μ-chains with immobilized peptides that were derived from the Ii cytoplasmic tail (22Bremnes T. Lauvrak V. Lindqvist B. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8638-8645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 23Rodionov D.G. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6005-6008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Apart from AP1 and AP2, leucine-based sorting motifs also bind to AP3, e.g. the leucine-based sorting motifs of the lysosomal membrane protein LIMP-II and of the melanosomal membrane protein tyrosinase bind to AP3 but not or only poorly to AP1 and AP2 (24Höning S. Sandoval I.V. Von Figura K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). However, it is not known which of the AP3 subunits mediates binding. In the present study, we used the trimeric invariant chain containing the two leucine-based sorting motifs to analyze binding to adaptor complexes. We provide biochemical evidence that the two leucine-based signals can interact independently of each other with AP1 and AP2 but not with AP3. Furthermore, our experiments support the concept that the leucine-based signals of Ii are recognized by the adaptor μ-chains. Plasmid pET3a.IiΔTM-His (25Vogt A.B. Stern L.J. Amshoff C. Dobberstein B. Hämmerling G.J. Kropshofer H. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4757-4765PubMed Google Scholar) encodes a soluble C-terminal histidine-tagged Ii molecule lacking the transmembrane domain. A mutant IiΔTM molecule lacking the cytoplasmic domain (IiΔTMΔCT) was generated by cleavage of pET3a.IiΔTM-His with NdeI and PstI. A double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-TATGGGTCGACTGGACAAACTGACAGTCACCTCCCAGAACCTGCA-3′) was inserted to generate an ATG start codon in front of the complete Ii luminal domain. The two leucine-based motifs in the Ii cytoplasmic tail were changed by overlap extension using the polymerase chain reaction (26Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) on pET3a.IiΔTM-His. Leucine and Isoleucine in positions 7 and 8 and methionine and leucine in positions 16 and 17 of IiΔTM were replaced by alanines generating LI → AA and ML → AA, respectively. Similarly a double mutant termed LI,ML → AA was created. The resulting plasmids were used to produce soluble IiΔTM- molecules in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Madison/WI). Expression of IiΔTM was induced by culturing cells in 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were collected by sedimentation, resuspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and disrupted by freeze/thawing in liquid nitrogen and lysozyme treatment (200 μg/ml, 15 min on ice). The bacterial lysates were first incubated with 10 units/ml DNase I for 15 min at room temperature, then adjusted to 500 mm NaCl and incubated for another 15 min on ice. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant contained most of the IiΔTM molecules. For affinity purification the extracts were adjusted to 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm imidazole and loaded onto a Ni2+/NTA-agarose column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). After extensive washing with 10 column volumes of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm imidazole, and 0.5m NaCl then 1 m NaCl then 20 mmHepes/KOH, pH 7.3, 90 mm KCl, and 2 mmMgCl2, the His-tagged IiΔTM molecules were eluted with 250 mm imidazole in the same buffer. The eluate was concentrated to half the volume by ultrafiltration with a 30-kDa cut-off filter (Centriprep-30 by Amicon, Witten, Germany), and proteins were separated by gel filtration on a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 prep grade column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The flow rate was adjusted to 2.6 ml/min. The sample was eluted in 20 mmHepes/KOH, pH 7.3, 90 mm KCl, and 2 mmMgCl2, and 4-ml fractions were collected. IiΔTMΔCT eluted with a relative molecular mass of about 100 kDa, and IiΔTM and its mutants, with masses of about 120 kDa. Because IiΔTM and IiΔTMΔCT have basic pIs, they were further purified by ion exchange chromatography on a Mono S HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). IiΔTM molecules eluted from the column between 200 and 400 mm KCl. Using ultrafiltration in Centriprep-30, the protein was concentrated to 1–2 mg/ml, and KCl concentration was adjusted to 90 mm. Concentrated protein was shock-frozen and stored at −20 °C. DNA coding for mouse μ1 and rat μ2 was kindly provided by Dr. T. Kirchhausen (Harvard Medical School). The full-length medium chains were cloned in-frame into the type IV pQE30 vector (Qiagen) to express constructs containing a histidine tag at their N termini. The oligonucleotides used for polymerase chain reaction amplification were TCCCGGGGATCCATGTCCGCCAGCGCCGTCTAC and TCTAGGCAAAGCTTTCACTGGGTCCGGACCTGATA for μ1 and GAGCTCGGTACCATGATCGGAGGCTTATTCATC and TCTAGGCAAAGCTTCTAGCAGCGGGTTTCGTAAAT for μ2. Amplified constructs were purified with QIAEX II kit (Qiagen) and cloned intoBamHI and HindIII (for μ1) or KpnI and HindIII (for μ2) sites of pQE30. Proteins were expressed in the bacterial strain M15 (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Both proteins formed inclusion bodies, which were solubilized in 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride containing 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were purified in one step under denaturing conditions on Ni2+-NTA resin (Qiagen) according to specifications of the manufacturer. Purified proteins were diluted to a concentration of 10–20 μg/ml and refolded in the binding buffer (0.1 mTris, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5). Before the binding assay, proteins were centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g (Airfuge) to remove the insoluble material. His-tagged dihydrofolate reductase was expressed from the control plasmid pQE16 supplied with the kit and purified according to manufacturer's recommendations. Protein concentration was determined from Coomassie-stained gels by comparison with protein standards. Cytoplasmic tails of the wild type Ii (Met-1 to Arg-30) and its L7A,L17A mutant were fused in-frame to the C terminus of the GST protein. The cytoplasmic tails of the Ii and the L7A,L17A mutant were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using the full-length Ii and the double alanine mutant (11Odorizzi C.G. Trowbridge I.S. Xue L. Hopkins C.R. Davis C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) as a template. The primers in both cases were TCCCGGGGATCCATGGATGACCAGCGCGAC (5′ primer,BamHI site) and CACGATGAATTCGCGGCTGCACTTGCTCTC (3′ primer,EcoRI site). The amplified constructs were cloned into pGEX-2t vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using theBamHI-EcoRI sites, and the frame was verified by sequencing. Fusion proteins were expressed and purified as recommended in the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech manual. Briefly, BL21 cells carrying the constructs of interest were induced with 0.25 misopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h and collected by centrifugation. The fusion proteins were released by a series of 15-s sonication bursts, purified on the GST-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and dialyzed overnight against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. A GST protein (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was also purified for use as a negative control in the subsequent experiments. To determine the oligomeric state of Ii molecules, the Ii oligomers were stabilized by chemical cross-linking using the dithiothreitol-cleavable homobifunctional cross-linking reagent DTSSP (Pierce). 0.25 mg/ml Ii polypeptides in 20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.3, 90 mm KCl, and 2 mm MgCl2 were incubated with increasing concentrations of DTSSP for 30 min at room temperature. After stopping the reaction with 50 mmglycine, the samples were divided into halves, trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence or absence of dithiothreitol. After Western blotting, the Ii polypeptides were visualized by using the QIAexpress detection system (Quiagen Ab, Hilden, Germany). Clathrin-coated vesicles were prepared from bovine brain essentially as described by (27Lindner R. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbock. 1. Academic Press, Inc., New York1994: 525-530Google Scholar) except using Hepes instead of Mes buffer. The coat components were released from the membranes with 0.5 m Tris/HCl, pH 7, 2 mm EDTA (28Keen J.H. Willingham M.C. Pastan I.H. Cell. 1979; 16: 303-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and separated from the vesicles by centrifugation at 240,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The extract was adjusted to 20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.3, 100 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm MgCl2and concentrated to 1–2 mg/ml protein using ultrafiltration in the stirring cell with a 10-kDa cut-off filter (Amicon, Witten, Germany). This clathrin-coated vesicle extract was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. For surface plasmon resonance studies, the clathrin adaptor complexes AP1 and AP2 were purified according to standard procedures from bovine or porcine brain (29Höning S. Griffith J. Geuze H.J. Hunziker W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5230-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Briefly, clathrin-coated vesicles were purified from brain after homogenization and differential centrifugation. Adaptor complexes were released from clathrin-coated vesicles with 0.5M Tris, pH 7.8, plus 2 mm EDTA for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, the material was applied to a Superose-6 column (2.5 × 75 cm) connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was equilibrated in 0.5M Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. Fractions containing adaptor complexes were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. AP1 was separated from AP2 by hydroxylapatite chromatography exactly as described by Manfredi and Bazari (30Manfredi J.J. Bazari W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12182-12188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AP1 and AP2 were concentrated to 0.2 mg/ml and dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 3 mm EDTA. This buffer was used for all experiments using surface plasmon resonance. For analyzing AP3 binding, cytosolic fractions of pig brain derived from gel filtration were used. These AP3-containing fractions were shown to be devoid of AP1 and AP2 (for details, see Ref. 24Höning S. Sandoval I.V. Von Figura K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) The interaction between the different Ii constructs and adaptors was analyzed in real time by surface plasmon resonance (31Jonsson U. Fagerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Lofas S. Persson B. Roos H. Ronnberg I. Biotechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar) using a BIAcore 2000 Biosensor (BIAcore AB). Ii constructs were immobilized via their hexahistidine tag to the surface of a NTA sensor chip according to the manufacturer's instruction. Buffers that were used include the running buffer A (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 μm EDTA, 0.005% Surfactant P20), the dispenser buffer (buffer A at 3 mm EDTA), the NiCl2 solution (500 μm NiCl2 in running buffer), and the regeneration solution (running buffer A at 0.35 mEDTA). In brief, the flow cell was first washed with 20 μl of the regeneration solution at a flow rate of 20 μl/min to remove contaminating metal ions. Subsequently the NTA surface was saturated with nickel by injecting the NiCl2 solution for 2 min at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Ii constructs (at 100 nm in running buffer) were then immobilized at a flow rate of 5 μl/min until the base-line shift was around 2000 response units, corresponding to 2 ng/mm2. GST fusion proteins of the Ii tail were immobilized to a CM5 sensor surface that was first coated with an anti-GST antibody (BIAcore AB) to a density of 5000 response units. GST-Ii fusion proteins were immobilized at a density of 1000 response units. All interaction experiments were performed with buffer A (see above) at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. When using isolated adaptor μ-chains, buffer A was adjusted to 0.5% Triton X-100. Association for 2 min was followed by dissociation for 2 min, during which buffer A was perfused. A short pulse injection (15 s) of 20 mm NaOH, 0.5% SDS was used to regenerate the sensor chip surface after each experimental cycle. The peptide-derivatized sensor chips remained stable and retained their specific binding capacity for more than 100 experimental cycles of association/dissociation and regeneration. AP1 and AP2 were used at 200 nm unless otherwise stated. The rate constants (k a for association and k d for dissociation) of the interaction between Ii construct and purified AP1 or AP2 were calculated by using the evaluation software of the BIAcore 2000. Association was determined 15–20 s after switching from buffer flow to adaptor solution to avoid distortions due to injection and mixing. The dissociation rate constants were determined 5–10 s after switching to buffer flow. After a first dissociation phase, for around 30 s further dissociation of adaptors was very low. The association constant k a, the dissociation constant k d, and the calculation of the equilibrium constant K D = k d /k a were determined by using the BIAevaluation software version 1.2, assuming a first order kinetic A + B = AB. The model calculates the association rate constantk a and the steady state response level Req by fitting data to the equation, R=Req(1−e−(kaCn+kd)(t−t0))(Eq. 1) where t is the time in s, Req is the steady state response level, and C is the molar concentration of adaptors in the injection solution. The steric interference factor Nthat describes the valency of the interaction between the adaptors and the Ii constructs was set to 1. The dissociation rate constantk d was determined by fitting data to the equation, R=R0e−kd(t−t0)(Eq. 2) where R 0 is the response level at the beginning time t 0 of the dissociation phase. This model, which has recently been applied to describe adaptor tail interaction (32Heilker R. Manning-Krieg U. Zuber J.F. Spiess M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), is described in more detail elsewhere (33Karlsson R. Michaelsson A. Mattsson L. J. Immunol.

Biochem. 1993; 212: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the above-described models allow the determination of rate constants without reaching equilibrium during the experimental cycle. To study the interaction between the cytoplasmic tail of the Ii and adaptor complexes, we generated soluble Ii molecules devoid of their membrane-spanning region (IiΔTM). Furthermore we produced mutant Ii molecules that lacked the entire cytoplasmic tail (IiΔTMΔCT) or contained alanine residues instead of either one (LI → AA; ML → AA) or both leucine-based motifs (LI,ML → AA) (Fig. 1). To facilitate purification, we added a hexahistidine tag to the C termini. The different Ii constructs were expressed in E. coli and purified using a Ni2+-NTA-agarose matrix. All Ii constructs expressed in E. coli were found to be largely soluble and not aggregated. After separation by gel filtration, they showed estimated molecular masses of about 120 kDa for IiΔTM and 100 kDa for IiΔTMΔCT (Fig. 2 A). Because the monomeric IiΔTMΔCT and IiΔTM molecules have molecular weights of about 26 and 28 kDa, respectively, we conclude that the IiΔTM molecules, like the authentic Ii molecules, form trimers (5Bijlmakers M.E.

To more directly investigate the oligomeric assembly of IiΔTM and IiΔTMΔCT, we cross-linked the subunits with the cleavable cross-linker DTSSP and separated the molecules under reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2, B and C). IiΔTM forms under nonreducing conditions mainly dimers, even in the absence of the cross-linker. In contrast, IiΔTMΔCT forms monomers. After cross-linking with 0.1 mm DTSSP, both IiΔTM and IiΔTMΔCT migrated as dimers and trimers.FIG. 2Soluble Ii polypeptides form trimers.Bacterially synthesized Ii polypeptides were purified via Ni2+-NTA-agarose affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration to separate Ii trimeric complexes. A, scheme of elution profile from gel filtration column. When IiΔTM and IiΔTMΔCT were fractionated on a Hiload 26/60 Superdex 200 prep grade column, high molecular weight aggregates (gray box) always eluted before the relevant protein peaks, which are indicated by the curves and which where used for binding studies. The column was calibrated with dextran blue (M r 2,000,000), ferritine (M r 440,000), aldolase (M r 158,000), albumin (M r67,000), ovalbumin (M r 43,000), chymotrypsin (M r 25,000), and ribonuclease A (M r 13,700). IiΔTM (B) and IiΔTMΔCT (C) were incubated with increasing concentrations of the cross-linking reagent DTSSP. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12.5%) in the absence (−) and presence (+) of dithiothreitol (DTT, 3 mm) followed by a Western blot and staining of Ii polypeptides with Ni2+-NTA conjugate. The Ii trimer (Ii × 3), dimer (Ii × 2), monomer (Ii × 1) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To analyze the interaction between the Ii cytoplasmic tail and AP1 or AP2, we used a biosensor system monitoring surface plasmon resonance. This method has been used successfully in other studies on the interaction between adaptors and cytoplasmic tails of the epidermal growth factor receptor, hemagglutinin, lysosome-associated membrane protein-1, and mannose 6-phosphate receptor (24Höning S.

When binding of purified AP1 and AP2 to IiΔTM and IiΔTMΔCT were tested, very low binding was found for the tailless mutant, whereas both adaptors bound with high affinity to IiΔTM. An equilibrium constant of 50 nm was determined for AP1 and 200 nm for AP2. The association constant (k a, m−1/s−1) was 4.4 × 104 for AP1 and 3.1 × 104for AP2; the dissociation constant (k d, s−1) was 2.2 × 10−4 for AP1 and 6.2 × 10−4 for AP2 (Fig. 3). The IiΔTM leucine mutants showed reduced binding in comparison with IiΔTM (see Table IA). When both leucine-based motifs were mutated, binding to AP1 and AP2 was too low to allow calculation of the rate constants. The on-rates for AP1 and AP2 binding to the ML → AA or LI → AA mutants were 1.3 to 4 times slower as compared with those determined for IiΔTM. The off-rates for these mutants were 1.5 times faster for AP2 and 0.8 times slower for AP1 as compared with IiΔTM. These experiments demonstrate that either of the leucine-based motifs can mediate high affinity binding of AP1 and AP2 and that their substitution by alanine residues results in complete loss of AP1 and AP2 binding.Table IKinetic rate constants for the interaction of Ii with adaptor complexes and isolated adaptor μ-chainsAP1AP2k sk dK Dk sk dK Dm −1, s −1s −1nmm −1, s −1s −1nmA Trimeric Iiwt (IiΔTM)4.4 × 1042.2 × 10−3503.1 × 1046.2 × 10−3200LI → AA1.0 × 1041.8 × 10−31801.9 × 1049.3 × 10−3490ML → AA2.1 × 1041.8 × 10−3862.5 × 1049.3 × 10−3372LI,ML → AABelow detectabilityBelow detectabilityIiΔTMΔCTBelow detectabilityBelow detectabilityB Monomeric GST-Ii fusion proteinwt3.7 × 1044.2 × 10−31141.8 × 1043.4 × 10−3250L7A,L17ABelow detectabilityBelow detectabilityμ1μ2k sk dK Dk sk dK Dm −1, s −1s −1nmm −1, s −1s −1nmC Trimeric Iiwt (IiΔTM)6.3 × 1045.2 × 10−3831.5 × 1043.7 × 10−3245LI → AA1.2 × 1042.7 × 10−32250.9 × 1044.8 × 10−3533ML → AA3.6 × 1044.3 × 10−31191.3 × 1046.2 × 10−3477 Open table in a new tab The experiments described above for adaptor binding to Ii were performed with soluble Ii trimers immobilized to the sensor surface.

Two controls, a GST-Ii tail fusion protein in which both leucine-based motifs were replaced by alanines and GST alone, did not bind AP-1 nor AP-2 (see Fig. 4 and Table IB).

There are four known members of the Mad family that are indistinguishable in their abilities to interact with Max, bind DNA, repress transcription, and block Myc + Ras co-transformation. To investigate functional differences between Mad family proteins, we have identified additional proteins that interact with this family. Here we present the identification and characterization of the novel basic-helix-loop-helix zipper protein Mlx (Max-like protein x), which is structurally and functionally related to Max. The similarities between Mlx and Max include 1) broad expression in many tissues, 2) long protein half-life, and 3) formation of heterodimers with Mad family proteins that are capable of specific CACGTG binding. We show that transcriptional repression by Mad1:Mlx heterodimers is dependent on dimerization, DNA binding, and recruitment of the mSin3A·HDAC corepressor complex. In contrast with Max, Mlx interacts only with Mad1 and Mad4.

Myc mRNA and protein expression is associated with cellular proliferation and is typically down-regulated during differentiation (22Cole M.D. Annu. Rev.

Isolation of Max heterocomplexes demonstrated a shift from Myc:Max to Mad1:Max heterocomplexes during chemically induced differentiation of a myeloid leukemia cell line and primary human keratinocytes (24Ayer D.E.

We have proposed that this switch in heterocomplexes is important in regulating cell cycle exit during differentiation, presumably by down-regulating Myc-dependent target genes required for cell proliferation (24Ayer D.E. Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2110-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the switch from Myc:Max to Mad:Max heterodimers has functional consequences in vivo. It is not yet understood what biological roles are played by individual members of the Mad family and what biochemical mechanisms provide specificity to Mad family function. In vitro studies cannot distinguish functional differences between Mad family members. For instance, each family member is able to repress transcription by targeting the mSin3A corepressor complex to DNA (31Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N.

However, analysis of madfamily mRNA expression patterns in developing embryos and the phenotypes of mice with null mutations in either mad1 ormxi1 suggests that the in vivo functions of the Mad family members are not completely redundant. The expression patterns of mad family and mnt mRNAs are unique and complex; although transcripts for mnt andmad3 are detected in proliferating cells, mxi1and mad4 transcripts are expressed early in the differentiation process, and mad1 transcripts appear later in differentiation (9Hurlin P.J.

Together these findings indicate that the activity of Mad family transcriptional repressors may be differentially regulated depending on the cell type or stage in the cellular differentiation program. To elucidate potential functional differences between the Mad family of transcription factors, we have identified additional members of this transcriptional network that interact with Mad1. Here we present the isolation and characterization of Mlx, a novel Max-like BHLHZip protein. Mlx, like Max, is a stable, widely expressed protein. In addition, Mlx forms heterodimers with Mad1 that are capable of interacting with the mSin3A corepressor and repressing transcription. However, unlike Max, Mlx forms heterodimers with only select members of the Mad family (Mad1 and Mad4). We propose that Mlx diversifies the functional capabilities of the Mad family of transcription factors by interacting with only a subset of Mad proteins. Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously using a VP16 library constructed from mRNA isolated from mouse embryos at 9.5 and 10.5 days p.c. (31Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar,48Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). 80 VP16 fusion clones were chosen for characterization. All 80 VP16 fusion clones failed to show a positive two-hybrid readout when tested for interaction with LexAMad1 in a wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain. However, when a subset of these clones was tested with LexAMad1 in a sin3 strain, all yielded β-galactosidase levels similar to those observed when they were tested for interaction with LexAMad1 (L12P/A16P) in a wild-type background (data not shown). Therefore, it is likely that the 80 VP16 fusions interacted with wild-type Mad1 in the two-hybrid analysis, but these interactions were masked because endogenous yeast SIN3p repressed the lacZ reporter gene. Full-length cDNAs encoding human and mouse Mlx were isolated from an HL60 cDNA library and an embryonic stem cell library, respectively. Mlx cDNAs were subcloned by standard methods into the mammalian expression vector pRC/CMV (Invitrogen). The mutant of Mlx lacking the leucine zipper (MlxΔLZ) was produced by polymerase chain reaction amplification and lacks amino acids 133–161. MlxΔLZ is completely defective for dimerization with Mad1 (data not shown). In ΔBRMlx, Glu-84 and Gln-85 of the basic region of Mlx were mutated to glycine and proline, respectively. These mutations abolish Mlx DNA binding (data not shown). VP16 fusions to Mad3, Mad4, N-Myc and L-Myc, and LexAMax were kindly provided by Dr. Peter Hurlin (Fred Hutchison Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA). VP16Mad1 and LexAMlx were constructed by amplifying the Mad1 or Mlx cDNA by polymerase chain reaction and cloning the products into pBTM116 or pVP16 (48Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), respectively. Multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were probed with the full-length Mlx cDNA, which had been labeled by random priming (Life Technologies, Inc.). Blots were washed with 0.1× SSPE (18 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaH2 PO4, 0.1 mmEDTA), 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 65 °C. In situhybridization was performed as described with 35S-labeled antisense probes against mad1, max, andmlx (27Queva C. Hurlin P.J. Foley K.P. Eisenman R.N. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 777-967Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed by incubating recombinant proteins, typically 1–10 ng, with 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled probe for 15 min at room temperature. The binding reactions contained 0.5× HMO.1 buffer (12.5 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), 0.4 mg ml−1 bovine serum albumin, 8 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.08% Nonidet P-40. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 5% nondenaturing acrylamide gels in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, at 4 °C. Rabbit polyclonal antisera specific for the N terminus and C terminus of Mlx were generated against GST fusion proteins encoding amino acids 1–76 or 162–244 of Mlx, respectively. Test bleeds were assayed for specific immunoreactivity by low and high stringency immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled in vitro translated Mlx. The purification of recombinant GST-BHLHZip Mlx (encoding amino acids 76–162), GST-BHLHZip-Mad3, GST-BHLHZip-Mad4, GST-C92-Myc, Mad1, and Max was based on previously published techniques (6Hurlin P.J.

Kretzner L. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1993; 72: 211-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). All other proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (24Ayer D.E. Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2110-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and visualized with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the manufacturer's protocol. Recombinant retrovirus expressing Mlx was made by filling in aHindIII/XbaI fragment containing the Mlx-coding region and adding ClaI linkers. The linked fragment was cloned in to the ClaI site of pSRα-MSV-TKCD8 (50Hirai H. Roussel M.F. Kato J.Y. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2672-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Virus was produced by transfecting 293 cells with the retroviral construct and a plasmid encoding an amphotrophic helper virus containing a virion packaging ψ2 sequence (51Muller A.J. Young J.C.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2309) Google Scholar). Supernatants containing retrovirus were collected 36 h after transfection and used to infect NIH3T3 cells. Three rounds of infection were performed in the presence of 8 μg ml−1 Polybrene, and cells were assayed for Mlx expression by indirect immunofluorescence. For the half-life experiments, cycloheximide was used at 10 μg ml−1. To determine if cycloheximide was effective at blocking protein synthesis at this concentration, control cells were treated for 1 h with the drug and then labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine (NEN Life Science Products) for 30 min. Trichloroacetic acid precipitation showed that approximately 95% of the de novo protein synthesis was blocked using these conditions. For luciferase assays, NIH3T3 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone), glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin were seeded onto 6-well dishes at 3 × 105 cells in 2 ml of medium/well. Twenty-four h after seeding, cells were transfected using Superfect (Qiagen) in triplicate. Each transfection contained 400 ng of luciferase reporter, 100 ng CMV-β-galactosidase, 1 μg of expression construct, and carrier DNA to a total of 5 μg of DNA. Cell lysates were prepared 24 h after transfection. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed according to manufacturers' instructions (Promega, Tropix). To normalize for transfection efficiency, luciferase values were divided by β-galactosidase activity values. Errors reported are the S.E. calculated from experiments performed in triplicate. The luciferase reporter pGL3-CM2 was constructed by inserting four copies of the E-box-containing sequence CCCAGTCGCACGTGCTGTAGG between the SacI andBglII sites of pGL3-promoter (Promega). In a previous yeast two-hybrid screen using Mad1 as bait, only the corepressors mSin3A and mSin3B were identified (31Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, LexAMad1 can repress transcription via interaction with the endogenous SIN3p corepressor complex (35Kasten M.M. Ayer D.E. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4215-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggesting that mSin3A and mSin3B were identified because they could displace the endogenous corepressor. Furthermore, because repression by the mSin3A·HDAC1 complex is dominant over activation by VP16 (36Ayer D.E. Laherty C.D. Lawrence Q.A. Armstrong A. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5772-5781Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), other proteins may have interacted with the LexAMad1 bait but failed to score positively due to a simultaneous interaction between the bait and the endogenous SIN3p corepressor (Fig. 1 A). To identify additional Mad1-interacting proteins, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using a fusion between the LexA DNA binding domain and a Mad1 protein that has proline substitutions (L12P/A16P) in the SID (Sin3-interaction domain) as bait. These mutations eliminate the interaction between Mad1 and mSin3 proteins or SIN3p (31Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 35Kasten M.M. Ayer D.E. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5772-5781Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) but leave the remainder of Mad1 functionally intact (Fig. 1 A). We reasoned that this bait might allow the detection of Mad1-interacting proteins other than mSin3A and mSin3B. Approximately 8 × 106 primary transformants were obtained using a VP16 fusion library made from day 9.5 and 10.5 p.c. mouse embryo cDNA and tested for growth on plates lacking histidine in the presence of 25 mm 3-aminotriazole. Eighty positive clones were chosen for further characterization. None of the 80 clones encoded mSin3A or mSin3B; therefore, by screening with a mutant Mad1 protein, we uncovered several new potential Mad1-interacting proteins. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that under certain circumstances, the spectrum of protein interactions uncovered by the two-hybrid methodology can be strongly influenced when the bait interacts with endogenous proteins. One of the 80 positive clones isolated in the two-hybrid screen encoded a novel BHLHZip protein with significant sequence similarities to the BHLHZip domain of Max and was chosen for further characterization. Based on the high degree of primary amino acid sequence homology to Max and on the functional characterization presented below, we have termed the proteinMax-like protein X (Mlx). We cloned full-length cDNAs encoding Mlx from both human and mouse and identified a putative Drosophila melanogaster Mlx homologue in the expressed sequence tag data base (LD05774 BerkeleyDrosophila Genome Project). The translation products of human and mouse Mlx are highly conserved over their entire length, differing at only four amino acid positions in their 244-amino acid open reading frames. A search of the data base revealed that our clone is identical to a previously described cDNA, transcription factor-like 4 (TCFL4), which was originally cloned in a screen for mRNAs differentially expressed in intestinal epithelium (37Bjerknes M. Cheng H. Gene. 1996; 181: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Based on our functional characterization, we propose that the Mlx nomenclature be adopted. The predicted amino acid sequence of Mlx is conserved at all of the positions that define the BHLHZip class of transcription factors (38Atchley W.R. Fitch W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5172-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) and is most similar to Max, displaying roughly 50 percent identity to the BHLHZip domain of Max (Fig. 1 B). The loop of the BHLHZip domain of Mlx consists of 15 amino acids, which is roughly 7 amino acids longer than the other members of the Max network. Outside of the BHLHZip domain, Mlx displays little similarity to Max, to other members of the Max network, or to other proteins in the data base (data not shown). Therefore, Mlx is more closely related to Max than any other known transcription factor, suggesting that it may be functionally related to Max as well. The max transcript is expressed in all tissues that have been examined, and therefore, Max protein is also thought to be expressed ubiquitously. To determine whether mlx displayed similar expression patterns, we examined expression levels and profiles for mlx using Northern blot and in situhybridization analysis. Northern blots probed at high stringency detected a predominant mlx mRNA of approximately 2.4 kilobases in all tissues tested, although testes, brain, placenta, and lung express reduced levels of mlx mRNA relative to other tissues (Fig. 2 A). In addition, smaller mlx transcripts are expressed in testes, heart, skeletal muscle, and liver. In situ hybridization of tissue sections derived from day 8.5 p.c. mouse embryos detected abundant mlx and max expression throughout the developing embryo with little expression in extraembryonic tissues (Fig. 2 B). At day 8.5 p.c., mad1 mRNA expression was restricted to the extraembryonic-reactive decidua with little or no mad1 mRNA expressed in the embryo proper (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). Expression of mlxpeaks between day 9.5 p.c. and day 11.5 p.c. and then decreases during the later stages of organogenesis (data not shown). Thus, similar to the mRNA for max, the mRNA encodingmlx is broadly distributed. To detect endogenous Mlx protein, we immunoprecipitated Mlx protein from cell extracts using antisera specific for the C terminus of Mlx and then detected it by Western blotting with antisera specific for the N terminus of Mlx (Fig. 3 A). A protein of approximately 30 kDa was immunoprecipitated from high stringency extracts of SW480 colon carcinoma cells. This protein was not detected in immunoprecipitates using preimmune serum. Furthermore, the immunoprecipitated protein is similar in apparent molecular mass to the one produced in 293 cells transfected with an expression vector encoding Mlx. Together, these data confirm that the immunoprecipitated 30-kDa protein is Mlx. A survey of other cell lines showed that HL60, P19, and PC12 cells also contained detectable Mlx protein, whereas NIH3T3 and 293 cells did not (data not shown). These data are consistent with the in situ hybridization and Northern-blotting results and suggest that Mlx protein expression is widely distributed although not ubiquitously expressed like Max. Max is a stable protein with a half-life of at least 6 h (39Blackwood E.M. Kretzner L. Eisenman R.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contrast, c-Myc and Mad1 turn over very rapidly, with half-lives of approximately 20 min (24Ayer D.E. Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2110-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 40Hann S.R. Thompson C.B. Eisenman R.N. Nature. 1985; 314: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). To determine the stability of Mlx, we measured its half-life in NIH3T3 cells that had been transduced with a Mlx-expressing retrovirus. Because Mlx is labeled poorly in vivo using [35S]methionine (data not shown), it was not possible to determine its half-life by performing a pulse-chase experiment. Therefore, the stability of Mlx was determined by blocking protein synthesis with cycloheximide and determining the amount of Mlx that remained at specific time points after cycloheximide addition. Mlx protein was detected by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting following 0, 2, 4, 6, and 12 h of cycloheximide treatment and appears to decay with a half-life of approximately 6–8 h (Fig. 3 B). Similar results were obtained with endogenous Mlx in SW480 cells (data not shown). Thus, Mlx is a relatively stable protein and is turned over with kinetics similar to those of Max. This suggests that the composition and function of Mlx heterocomplexes, like that of Max heterocomplexes, might be dictated by unstable protein partners. Proteins of the Max network bind the DNA recognition element CACGTG as heterodimers (3Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N.

In the current study, two approaches were taken to determine if tandem B1 repetitive elements found at the 3′ end of the methylation center contribute to the methylation signal.

Walsh C.P. Bestor T.H. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 335-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar, 2Bestor T.H. Novartis Found. Symp. 1998; 214: 187-195PubMed Google Scholar). Transposons represent ∼35% of the human genome, yet they contain the majority of genomic 5-methylcytosine bases. Most transposons are retroposons that have integrated into multiple genomic locations via RNA intermediates. For example, the abundant human Alu elements and the homologous mouse B1 elements apparently arose from the reverse transcription and integration of 7SL RNA (3Sinnett D. Richer C. Deragon J.M. Labuda D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8675-8678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Labuda D. Sinnett D. Richer C. Deragon J.M. Striker G. J. Mol. Evol. 1991; 32: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). DNA methylation has been shown to repress the transcription of Alu sequences both in vitro and in vivo (5Liu W.M. Schmid C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 6Liu W.M. Maraia R.J. Rubin C.M. Schmid C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Similarly, DNA methylation apparently represses mouse IAP retroviral element transcription as DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt1)-deficient mouse embryos express dramatically increased IAP transcript levels when compared with wild type embryos (7Walsh C.P. Chaillet J.R. Bestor T.H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 116-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Moreover, retroviral long terminal repeats are both methylated and repressed following introduction into embryonal cell types (8Jahner D. Jaenisch R. Nature. 1985; 315: 594-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).One prediction of the protective hypothesis for DNA methylation is that retroposons should serve as substrates for de novo DNA methylation (9Turker M.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We have described previously an 838-base pair methylation center located upstream of the mouse adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Aprt) gene (see Fig. 1 A) that signals de novo methylation upon transfection into mouse embryonal carcinoma (EC)1 cells (10Mummaneni P. Bishop P.L. Turker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 552-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We report here that two tandem B1 elements are located at the 3′ end of the methylation center. These elements are methylated at relatively high levels in embryonic cells with severe Dnmt1 deficiency. Such cells have little or no maintenance methylation activity but retainde novo methylation activity (11Lei H. Oh S.P. Okano M. Jüttermann R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E. Development. 1996; 122: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the B1 elements became methylated de novo when transfected into mouse EC cells. Together, these results suggest that these B1 repetitive elements account for a significant portion of theAprt methylation center signal.DISCUSSIONThe endogenous targets for de novo DNA methylation in the mammalian genome have not been described (9Turker M.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In previous work we identified a methylation center upstream of mouse Aprt that can signal de novo methylation when transfected into mouse EC cells and from which methylation can spread (10Mummaneni P. Bishop P.L. Turker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 552-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We report here that two B1 repetitive elements are located at the 3′ end of the methylation center and have used two approaches to obtain evidence suggesting strongly that this pair can act as a unit to create a strongde novo methylation signal.The first approach was to examine methylation of CpG sites included within and flanking the B1–5 and B1–6 elements in ES cells homozygous for the Dnmt c/c allele. This allele contains a knockout mutation in the region of the Dnmt1 gene that encodes the catalytic domain. Therefore these cells lack the enzymatic function responsible for the spreading of methylation and its maintenance, although they still retain the capacity to methylate DNAde novo. Presumably the regions of the genome that remain methylated in these cells are those that attract most strongly de novo methylation. With the bisulfite-sequencing method we demonstrated that CpG sites in the B1 elements under study are methylated at a relative level of 43% in theDnmt c/c cells when compared with the same sites in ES cells with wild type Dnmt1 alleles. If the above presumption is correct, these elements are acting as strong signals forde novo methylation. It is noted that the downstream H2 site, which becomes methylated as a function of spreading from the methylation center, is essentially unmethylated in theDnmt c/c cells (9Turker M.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Methylation of other repetitive elements has also been reported in theDnmt c/c ES cells. Using the bisulfite method, Woodcock et al. (23Woodcock D.M. Linsenmeyer M.E. Warren W.D. Gene. 1998; 206: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) show that CpG sites within A-repeats are methylated at a consensus relative level of 29% (absolute level of 13%) in the Dnmt c/c cells when compared with the wild type ES cells. A Southern blot analysis showed methylation of endogenous Moloney murine leukemia retrovirus in theDnmt c/c cells, although the absolute and relative levels were not quantified (11Lei H. Oh S.P. Okano M. Jüttermann R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E. Development. 1996; 122: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these results, a very low level of methylation (<1.4%) was observed for CpG sites within the H19-imprinted region in the Dnmt c/c allele ES cells. This region is completely methylated on the marked alleles in the wild type ES cells (24Warnecke P.M. Biniszkiewicz D. Jaenisch R. Frommer M. Clark S.J. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).The second approach we used to examine methylation potential for the B1 elements was to test their ability to become methylated de novo when transfected into mouse EC cells. These cells possess a high capacity for de novo methylation of transfected plasmid constructs that contain the methylation center (10Mummaneni P. Bishop P.L. Turker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 552-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Turker M.S. Mummaneni P. Bishop P.L. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1991; 17: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although some variability in methylation can be attributed to integration sites, the average methylation levels reflect sequence content of the transfected constructs (25Hertz J.M. Schell G. Doerfler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24232-24240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). With this approach we found that the B1 dimer could direct a high level of methylation for the H1 and H2 sites, at average levels near that observed for the corresponding endogenous region (9Turker M.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,17Turker M.S. Swisshelm K. Smith A.C. Martin G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11632-11636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Turker M.S. Mummaneni P. Cooper G.E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 111: 647-652Google Scholar). A similarly sized contiguous downstream fragment of 272 base pairs that lacked B1 elements failed to elicit a significant methylation response, which confirmed specificity for methylation of the B1 elements and which also confirmed that the H1 site is very close to the 3′ end of the methylation center.It is interesting to note that the human Alu repetitive element, which is homologous to the mouse B1 element, is found normally as a tandem pair of monomeric units (26Schmid C.W. Jelinek W.R. Science. 1982; 216: 1065-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Copies of this element are methylated at high levels in human somatic cells (27Hellmann-Blumberg U. Hintz M.F. Gatewood J.M. Schmid C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4523-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 28Kochanek S. Renz D. Doerfler W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1141-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Moreover, spreading of methylation from Alu elements has been suggested as playing a causal role in epigenetic inactivation of some tumor suppressor genes (29Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Vertino P.M. Issa J.-P. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 141-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,30Graff J.R. Herman J.G. Myöhänen S. Baylin S.B. Vertino P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22322-22329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). DNA fragments containing B1, B2, or L1 elements have been shown to enhance methylation of a bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fragment in F9 EC cells (31Hasse A. Schultz W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1821-1826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the elements were not tested as isolated units as performed here, and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fragment elicited significant methylation by itself. Moreover, the constructs were introduced by the calcium phosphate method, which can often lead to high copy numbers of integrated plasmids. High copy numbers can cause high levels of methylation (32Garrick D. Fiering S. Martin D.I.K. Whitelaw E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 56-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). To prevent this form of nonspecific methylation, we used electroporation to keep copy numbers at low levels (14Turker M.S. Mummaneni P. Bishop P.L. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1991; 17: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Although the B1–6 element did not become methylated when tested independently, suggesting that loss of the 5′ end decreased its intrinsic methylation signal, an artificial HpaII site placed at its 3′ end (i.e. 5′ end of insert) became methylated at an average minimal level of 59% when combined in tandem with B1–5. Moreover, the CpG sites in B1–6 (two sites in P19 EC cells, one site in the ES cells) were methylated at high levels at their endogenous location in wild type cells (82% in ES cells) and at relatively high levels in the Dnmt c/c ES cells (27%). This latter observation is taken as evidence that these sites are methylated de novo at their endogenous location despite the relative lack of methylation of B1–6 when tested independently. In total, these data and those obtained with the B1–5 insert suggest that the B1–5 and B1–6 elements act synergistically in their normal tandem orientation to signal DNA methylation. The data obtained with the B1–5 insert further suggest that a single intact B1 element can provide a strong methylation signal. Considering that there are several hundred thousand B1 elements in the mouse genome (26Schmid C.W. Jelinek W.R. Science. 1982; 216: 1065-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), it is possible that B1 elements account for a significant fraction of mouse genome methylation.Finally, the results obtained in this study have direct relevance for the hypothesis that a function of DNA methylation in mammalian cells is to protect the genome from expression and transposition of repetitive elements (1Yoder J.A. Walsh C.P. Bestor T.H. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 335-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar, 2Bestor T.H. Novartis Found. Symp. 1998; 214: 187-195PubMed Google Scholar). A large number of these elements exist in the mammalian genome, and in general they are highly methylated in somatic cells. As mentioned above, high levels of methylation have been observed for repetitive elements analyzed in Dnmt c/c cells. It has been suggested that methylation of repetitive elements can repress their expression, which is linked to transposition events, in two ways. One is by methylation-mediated transcriptional inactivation, and the second is by increasing the rates of C → T mutations over the course of evolution (2Bestor T.H. Novartis Found. Symp. 1998; 214: 187-195PubMed Google Scholar). An example of this type of mutation is the absence of CpG site 2 in B1–6 (Table I) in the 129/Sv strain. Our results provide the first direct demonstration that one class of repetitive elements, i.e. B1 elements derived from 7SL RNA, can signal methylation de novo. Similar findings with other endogenous “parasitic” elements are a logical prediction of the protection hypothesis and are necessary for its further testing. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that a primary function of CpG methylation in mammals is to protect the genome from the expression and transposition of parasitic DNA elements (1Yoder J.A. Walsh C.P. Bestor T.H. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 335-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar, 2Bestor T.H. Novartis Found. Symp. 1998; 214: 187-195PubMed Google Scholar).

Labuda D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8675-8678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Labuda D. Sinnett D. Richer C. Deragon J.M. Striker G. J. Mol. Evol. 1991; 32: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). DNA methylation has been shown to repress the transcription of Alu sequences both in vitro and in vivo (5Liu W.M. Schmid C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 6Liu W.M. Maraia R.J. Rubin C.M. Schmid C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Similarly, DNA methylation apparently represses mouse IAP retroviral element transcription as DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt1)-deficient mouse embryos express dramatically increased IAP transcript levels when compared with wild type embryos (7Walsh C.P. Chaillet J.R. Bestor T.H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 116-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Moreover, retroviral long terminal repeats are both methylated and repressed following introduction into embryonal cell types (8Jahner D. Jaenisch R. Nature. 1985; 315: 594-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). One prediction of the protective hypothesis for DNA methylation is that retroposons should serve as substrates for de novo DNA methylation (9Turker M.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We have described previously an 838-base pair methylation center located upstream of the mouse adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Aprt) gene (see Fig. 1 A) that signals de novo methylation upon transfection into mouse embryonal carcinoma (EC)1 cells (10Mummaneni P. Bishop P.L. Turker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 552-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We report here that two tandem B1 elements are located at the 3′ end of the methylation center. These elements are methylated at relatively high levels in embryonic cells with severe Dnmt1 deficiency. Such cells have little or no maintenance methylation activity but retainde novo methylation activity (11Lei H. Oh S.P. Okano M. Jüttermann R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E. Development. 1996; 122: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the B1 elements became methylated de novo when transfected into mouse EC cells. Together, these results suggest that these B1 repetitive elements account for a significant portion of theAprt methylation center signal. DISCUSSIONThe endogenous targets for de novo DNA methylation in the mammalian genome have not been described (9Turker M.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In previous work we identified a methylation center upstream of mouse Aprt that can signal de novo methylation when transfected into mouse EC cells and from which methylation can spread (10Mummaneni P. Bishop P.L. Turker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 552-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We report here that two B1 repetitive elements are located at the 3′ end of the methylation center and have used two approaches to obtain evidence suggesting strongly that this pair can act as a unit to create a strongde novo methylation signal.The first approach was to examine methylation of CpG sites included within and flanking the B1–5 and B1–6 elements in ES cells homozygous for the Dnmt c/c allele. This allele contains a knockout mutation in the region of the Dnmt1 gene that encodes the catalytic domain. Therefore these cells lack the enzymatic function responsible for the spreading of methylation and its maintenance, although they still retain the capacity to methylate DNAde novo. Presumably the regions of the genome that remain methylated in these cells are those that attract most strongly de novo methylation. With the bisulfite-sequencing method we demonstrated that CpG sites in the B1 elements under study are methylated at a relative level of 43% in theDnmt c/c cells when compared with the same sites in ES cells with wild type Dnmt1 alleles. If the above presumption is correct, these elements are acting as strong signals forde novo methylation. It is noted that the downstream H2 site, which becomes methylated as a function of spreading from the methylation center, is essentially unmethylated in theDnmt c/c cells (9Turker M.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Methylation of other repetitive elements has also been reported in theDnmt c/c ES cells. Using the bisulfite method, Woodcock et al. (23Woodcock D.M. Linsenmeyer M.E. Warren W.D. Gene. 1998; 206: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) show that CpG sites within A-repeats are methylated at a consensus relative level of 29% (absolute level of 13%) in the Dnmt c/c cells when compared with the wild type ES cells. A Southern blot analysis showed methylation of endogenous Moloney murine leukemia retrovirus in theDnmt c/c cells, although the absolute and relative levels were not quantified (11Lei H. Oh S.P. Okano M. Jüttermann R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E. Development. 1996; 122: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these results, a very low level of methylation (<1.4%) was observed for CpG sites within the H19-imprinted region in the Dnmt c/c allele ES cells. This region is completely methylated on the marked alleles in the wild type ES cells (24Warnecke P.M. Biniszkiewicz D. Jaenisch R. Frommer M. Clark S.J. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).The second approach we used to examine methylation potential for the B1 elements was to test their ability to become methylated de novo when transfected into mouse EC cells. These cells possess a high capacity for de novo methylation of transfected plasmid constructs that contain the methylation center (10Mummaneni P. Bishop P.L. Turker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 552-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Turker M.S. Mummaneni P. Bishop P.L. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1991; 17: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although some variability in methylation can be attributed to integration sites, the average methylation levels reflect sequence content of the transfected constructs (25Hertz J.M. Schell G. Doerfler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24232-24240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). With this approach we found that the B1 dimer could direct a high level of methylation for the H1 and H2 sites, at average levels near that observed for the corresponding endogenous region (9Turker M.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,17Turker M.S. Swisshelm K. Smith A.C. Martin G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11632-11636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Turker M.S. Mummaneni P. Cooper G.E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 111: 647-652Google Scholar). A similarly sized contiguous downstream fragment of 272 base pairs that lacked B1 elements failed to elicit a significant methylation response, which confirmed specificity for methylation of the B1 elements and which also confirmed that the H1 site is very close to the 3′ end of the methylation center.It is interesting to note that the human Alu repetitive element, which is homologous to the mouse B1 element, is found normally as a tandem pair of monomeric units (26Schmid C.W. Jelinek W.R. Science. 1982; 216: 1065-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Copies of this element are methylated at high levels in human somatic cells (27Hellmann-Blumberg U. Hintz M.F. Gatewood J.M. Schmid C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4523-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 28Kochanek S. Renz D. Doerfler W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1141-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Moreover, spreading of methylation from Alu elements has been suggested as playing a causal role in epigenetic inactivation of some tumor suppressor genes (29Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Vertino P.M. Issa J.-P. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 141-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,30Graff J.R. Herman J.G. Myöhänen S. Baylin S.B. Vertino P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22322-22329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). DNA fragments containing B1, B2, or L1 elements have been shown to enhance methylation of a bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fragment in F9 EC cells (31Hasse A. Schultz W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1821-1826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the elements were not tested as isolated units as performed here, and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fragment elicited significant methylation by itself. Moreover, the constructs were introduced by the calcium phosphate method, which can often lead to high copy numbers of integrated plasmids. High copy numbers can cause high levels of methylation (32Garrick D. Fiering S. Martin D.I.K. Whitelaw E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 56-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). To prevent this form of nonspecific methylation, we used electroporation to keep copy numbers at low levels (14Turker M.S. Mummaneni P. Bishop P.L. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1991; 17: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Although the B1–6 element did not become methylated when tested independently, suggesting that loss of the 5′ end decreased its intrinsic methylation signal, an artificial HpaII site placed at its 3′ end (i.e. 5′ end of insert) became methylated at an average minimal level of 59% when combined in tandem with B1–5. Moreover, the CpG sites in B1–6 (two sites in P19 EC cells, one site in the ES cells) were methylated at high levels at their endogenous location in wild type cells (82% in ES cells) and at relatively high levels in the Dnmt c/c ES cells (27%). This latter observation is taken as evidence that these sites are methylated de novo at their endogenous location despite the relative lack of methylation of B1–6 when tested independently. In total, these data and those obtained with the B1–5 insert suggest that the B1–5 and B1–6 elements act synergistically in their normal tandem orientation to signal DNA methylation. The data obtained with the B1–5 insert further suggest that a single intact B1 element can provide a strong methylation signal. Considering that there are several hundred thousand B1 elements in the mouse genome (26Schmid C.W. Jelinek W.R. Science. 1982; 216: 1065-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), it is possible that B1 elements account for a significant fraction of mouse genome methylation.Finally, the results obtained in this study have direct relevance for the hypothesis that a function of DNA methylation in mammalian cells is to protect the genome from expression and transposition of repetitive elements (1Yoder J.A. Walsh C.P. Bestor T.H. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 335-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar, 2Bestor T.H. Novartis Found. Symp. 1998; 214: 187-195PubMed Google Scholar). A large number of these elements exist in the mammalian genome, and in general they are highly methylated in somatic cells. As mentioned above, high levels of methylation have been observed for repetitive elements analyzed in Dnmt c/c cells. It has been suggested that methylation of repetitive elements can repress their expression, which is linked to transposition events, in two ways. One is by methylation-mediated transcriptional inactivation, and the second is by increasing the rates of C → T mutations over the course of evolution (2Bestor T.H. Novartis Found. Symp. 1998; 214: 187-195PubMed Google Scholar). An example of this type of mutation is the absence of CpG site 2 in B1–6 (Table I) in the 129/Sv strain. Our results provide the first direct demonstration that one class of repetitive elements, i.e. B1 elements derived from 7SL RNA, can signal methylation de novo. Similar findings with other endogenous “parasitic” elements are a logical prediction of the protection hypothesis and are necessary for its further testing.

The control mechanisms that underlie the distribution of glycosyltransferases into different Golgi subcompartments are not understood. Some key enzymes like α-mannosidase II and GnT-I1 have been localized in the medial Golgi and trans-Golgi, whereas several terminal glycosyltransferases (GalT-I, ST6Gal I, ST3Gal III, FT5, FT6) have been localized in the trans-Golgi/TGN (2Nilsson T.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4695-4704Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) postulates that the length of the transmembrane region of transferases mediates Golgi retention. A second hypothesis (3Nilsson T. Hoe M.H. Slusarewicz P. Rabouille C. Watson R. Hunte F. Watzele G. Berger E.G. Warren G.

Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) proposes a disulfide-linked homo-/hetero-oligomerization of the enzymes to function as a Golgi retention signal by preventing the large complexes from being delivered to secretory vesicles and ongoing transport to the plasma membrane. Neither model provides sufficient information about the mechanisms that control the in vivo functional organization of the different members of the glycosyltransferase families and how their sequential arrangement within different subcompartments might be accomplished. Immunochemical localization techniques lack the sensitivity to resolve in detail the distribution of, for example, the many late acting Golgi glycosyltransferases in the functional network of thetrans-Golgi/TGN (10Gleeson P.A. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 517-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A further complication with immunodetection of enzymes in defined subcompartments results from the migration of the newly synthesized membrane-bound glycosyltransferases from the endoplasmic reticulum through the compartments of the secretory pathway until they arrive at their final destination in individual functional Golgi stacks. It has been shown that glycosyltransferases themselves undergo complex-typeN-glycosylation including terminal sialylation (15Bosshart H. Berger E.G. Eur. J.

In addition, there are several reports describing different levels of intracellular proteolytically cleaved forms of certain glycosyltransferases that might change under different physiological conditions in different cells (18Strous G.J.A.M.

A major problem of immunohistochemical methods is that they do not provide any information concerning the in vivo functional activity of the detected enzyme species. Assuming a defined in vivo acceptor substrate specificity for glycosyltransferases, their sequential action and possibly also their sequential distribution along the secretory pathway should be reflected in the final oligosaccharide structure of the biosynthetic products of a cell (e.g. in a secretory glycoprotein). Therefore, the structural characterization of a reporter glycoprotein expressed at a constant level from cells transfected with new glycosyltransferase genes should allow to identify the position of the newly introduced enzyme within the biosynthetic reaction sequence of the host cell. We have recently analyzed in detail the in vivo biosynthetic activity of the human α1,3/4-fucosyltransferases III–VII (FT3–FT7) in BHK-21 cells (17Grabenhorst E. Nimtz M. Costa J. Conradt H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30985-30994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) by stable coexpression of each individual enzyme together with human β-TP, which is decorated exclusively with diantennary complex-type N-glycans (17Grabenhorst E.

We found that each human α1,3/4-fucosyltransferase is characterized in vivo by the synthesis of an individual ratio of sLex:Lex, with FT7 forming exclusively sLex and FT4 preponderantly (90%) Lex, whereas FT6 expression results in a 1.1:1 mixture of sLex and Lex motifs in the oligosaccharides of the coexpressed reporter glycoprotein β-TP. The in vitro specificity data of the enzymes clearly support the exclusive sLex-forming specificity of the FT7 catalytic domain and the Lex-forming specificity of the FT4 catalytic domain. Consequently, in order to get access to its Gal(β1→4)GlcNAc-R substrate, FT4 should be localized in a cellular subcompartment before α2,3-sialylation occurs, since, according to all data available, the human α2,3-sialyltransferase ST3Gal III does not transfer NeuAc to Lex (compare Fig. 1). Likewise, FT7 action strictly depends on the proper supply with α2,3-sialylated acceptors. FT7 should either colocalize with ST3Gal III in the same functional area, or, more preferably, should reside in a later subcompartment in order to get access to high acceptor substrate concentrations. The human FT6 catalytic domain recognizes both, in vivo and in vitro, the sialylated or unsialylated acceptor motifs with a high efficiency (17Grabenhorst E. Nimtz M. Costa J. Conradt H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30985-30994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27Nimtz M. Grabenhorst E. Gambert U. Costa J. Wray V. Morr M. Thiem J. Conradt H.S. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 873-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar); therefore, this enzyme should either colocalize with ST3Gal III, resulting in competition for the common Gal(β1→4)GlcNAc-R substrate, or should have a broader subcompartmental distribution. We have also shown that a variant of FT6 constructed by replacement of its CTS region with the signal peptide sequence of human interleukin-2 is efficiently secreted from cells but does not show in vivo functional activity when expressed at a total activity level comparable with wt-FT6 cells (17Grabenhorst E.

If localizing to early Golgi compartments, the FT6 catalytic domain would be expected to encounter low levels of sialylated N-glycans and preferentially would transfer Fuc to Gal(β1→4)GlcNAc-R, resulting in increased Lex synthesis detectable in the secreted product. Likewise, its targeting to a later compartment would be expected to lead to preferential formation of sLexmotifs by the enzyme from the availability of already α2,3-sialylated precursor substrates. In the present report, we have fused CTS regions of different donor glycosyltransferases to the N terminus of the FT6 catalytic domain and have stably expressed the constructs in BHK-21 cells together with human β-TP, resulting in expression levels comparable with those in wt-FT6 cells. The characterization of the oligosaccharides attached to the secreted reporter glycoprotein should also allow the identification of any possible interference with the integrity of the cellular glycosylation pathway that could have resulted from the genetic engineering procedure.

The cDNAs of three BHK-21 cell sialyltransferases were cloned by PCR using primers homologous to human ST3Gal III (44Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The PCR was performed as above using the following primer pairs (upper/lower): 5′-AG ATG GGA CTC TTG GTA TTT GT/5′-TCA GAT GCC ACT GCT TAG ATC AGT GAT (ST3Gal III), 5′-AAC ATG GTC AGC AAG TCC CGC T/5′-GGT CAG AAG GAC GTG AGG TTC (ST3Gal IV), and 5′-TTA TAC CAA GAG AAG GTG CC/5′-GAT CCT TCA ATA TGT GCT TTA TT (ST8Sia IV) and 35 cycles with 15 s at 94 °C, 20 s at 45 °C/52 °C/50 °C, respectively, and 120 s at 72 °C. The homology of the BHK-21 cDNA sequences to the human sequences was found to be 91% for ST3Gal III, 87% for ST3Gal IV, and 91% for ST8Sia IV. The PCR products were cloned into the vector pCR3.1 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and were subsequently used as templates for the generation of CTS mutants of human FT6 as detailed below. Chimeric constructs of FT6 were generated by fusing the CTS regions of nine different mammalian Golgi glycosyltransferases (51–126 aa) to the N terminus of the FT6 catalytic domain (compare Fig. 2and Table I for details). For each variant, a 5′-megaprimer encoding the donor glycosyltransferase CTS region and containing 13–16 bases homologous to the 3′-end of the FT6 coding sequence was prepared from the mammalian glycosyltransferase cDNAs cited above by using the following primer pairs (upper/lower): 5′-AGG ATG CTG AAG AAG CAG TCT GCA G/5′-CAG GGG GAT GGA GTG GGC CGG CGC GGG GGT CAC AGG (GnT-I), 5′-AAG ATG AGA CGC TAC AAG CTC T/5′-CCA CAG CAG GAT CAG GGG CGA GTG GGA GTA (GnT-III), 5′-AAG ATG AGG CTT CGG GAG CCG CTC/5′-CAG GGG GAT GGA GTG GGC GGG CAG CGA CAG TGC (GalT-I), 5′-AG ATG GGA CTC TTG GTA TTT GT/5′-GGG CGG GGG TCC CTG TGC TGT CCA GCT TCA GGA GAA AAC C (ST3Gal III); 5′-AAC ATG GTC AGC AAG TCC CGC T/5′-CAG CAG GAT CAG GGG GAT GGC TAA CAC CCG GAG (ST3Gal IV), 5′-ATT ATG ATT CAC ACC AAC CTG AA/5′-CAG GGG GAT GGA GGC CTC TGG TT (ST6Gal I), 5′-TTA TAC CAA GAG AAG GTG CC/5′-CAG CAG GAT CAG GGG GAT GGT TGA GCC AGC CTT (ST8Sia IV), 5′-ACT CTG ACC CAT GGA TCC CCT/5′-ACA CCT TGC GGT CGG CAG TGA T (FT3), and 5′-TCT CTT GGC TGA CTG ATC CTG GG/5′-AAA AGG CCA CGT CCA GAC AAG GAT GGT GAT (FT7).The megaprimers were used in a second PCR together with the 3′-primer 5′-TCA CTT GCC GCT GTT TGC GAC GTA ATT TTT GTC GAA TCC AGC TCC GGT GAA CCA AGC CGC for the generation of full-length chimeric FT6 cDNA essentially as described (17Grabenhorst E.

In most cases, cell lines showing a similar β-TP expression levels in Western blots and similar FT6 in vitro activity in cellular extracts compared with the well characterized wt-FT6 cell line (17Grabenhorst E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30985-30994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) were used for the further characterization of the reporter glycoprotein. For this, the cells were cultivated for 2–3 weeks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing alternatingly 0 or 2% fetal bovine serum, respectively, and about 0.5 mg of recombinant human β-TP was purified from 500–1000 ml of culture supernatants by immunoaffinity chromatography as described (17Grabenhorst E.

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (47Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar) using 12.5 and 3% acrylamide in the resolution and stacking gels, respectively. For Western blot analysis, proteins were transferred to Immobilon NC membranes (Millipore Corp.) by using a TransBlot™ SD transfer cell (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked for 1 h with Tris-buffered saline containing 10% horse serum and 3% bovine serum albumin and was incubated overnight with rabbit anti-β-TP antiserum in blocking buffer at a 1:1000 dilution. The second antibody, goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin coupled to horseradish peroxidase, was used at a 1:500 dilution. The blots were developed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5 g/liter 4-chloro-1-naphtol solubilized in methanol and 0.2% H2O2. Immunodetection of secreted FT6 variants was performed essentially as described for β-TP using a rabbit antiserum raised against the human FT6 peptide R125RQGQRWIWFSMESPSHCWQLK following immunoaffinity purification on the peptide antigen coupled to Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad). Cell culture supernatants of stable cell lines expressing CTS variants of FT6 were analyzed for secreted forms of the enzymes by an in vitro α1,3-fucosyltransferase assay as detailed previously for wt-FT6 cells (17Grabenhorst E. Nimtz M. Costa J. Conradt H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30985-30994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The secreted chimeric enzymes were partially purified by affinity chromatography on a GDP-Fractogel column and characterized by Western blotting. The N terminus of the secreted form of wt-FT6 was determined by gas phase sequencing of the protein following transfer onto an Immobilon-P (Millipore) membrane. Purified β-TP was reduced, carboxamidomethylated, and digested with trypsin, and the free reducingN-glycans were obtained from reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography-purified glycopeptides by peptide-N 4-(N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase F digestion as detailed earlier (24Hoffmann A. Nimtz M. Wurster U. Conradt H.S. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 2185-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The released oligosaccharide material was subsequently analyzed by HPAE-PAD using conditions identical to those that were applied for the characterization of β-TP glycans from wt-FT6 cells (17Grabenhorst E. Nimtz M. Costa J. Conradt H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30985-30994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Identification and quantitation of the β-TP N-glycans was achieved by comparison with the elution profile of β-TP oligosaccharides from wt-FT6 cells, since this material contained all possible α1,3-fucosylated diantennary structures as was revealed in our previous investigation by using methylation analysis and mass spectrometry of individual oligosaccharide fractions (17Grabenhorst E. Nimtz M. Costa J. Conradt H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30985-30994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Similarly to wt-FT6 cells, more than 90% of the oligosaccharides from CTS variant cells were of the diantennaryN-acetyllactosamine type, differing only in their content and the distribution of α2,3-linked NeuAc and α1,3-linked Fuc residues. The design of human FT6 CTS-variants is based on our previous finding that the catalytic domain of FT6 contains the in vivo specificity to transfer Fuc in α1,3-linkage to GlcNAc in both sialylated and unsialylated type II N-acetyllactosamine oligosaccharide chains of coexpressed human β-TP with a similar efficiency (17Grabenhorst E. Nimtz M. Costa J. Conradt H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30985-30994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The transmembrane domain as well as flanking regions of FT6 are required for its in vivo functional activity, since an engineered truncated form of the enzyme lacking the first 51 aa, when fused to the interleukin-2 signal peptide, is efficiently secreted from BHK-21 cells and does not fucosylate any oligosaccharide of coexpressed β-TP when expressed at an intracellular enzyme activity level comparable with wt-FT6 cells (17Grabenhorst E. Nimtz M. Costa J. Conradt H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30985-30994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 and Table I, CTS-regions from donor glycosyltransferases of different length were fused to the N terminus of the human FT6 catalytic domain. The precise location of the catalytic domains of many glycosyltransferases is unknown (10Gleeson P.A. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 517-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In analogy to the data reported for truncated forms of the highly homologous human FT3 (48Xu Z. Vo L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8818-8823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the catalytic domain of human FT6 was defined by the shortest C-terminal part that showed no loss of enzyme activity in vitro and contained the minimum sequence starting from Pro-62 (… PLILLWTW …), with the exception of ft7-FT6 and ft3-FT6, where the FT6 sequence starts with Trp-67 or Ile-92, respectively. Thus, the new CTS regions introduced into the chimeric FT6 variants contained the entire cytoplasmic and transmembrane domain of the corresponding donor glycosyltransferase as well as the stem region or parts thereof replacing 51–91 aa of the N terminus of wt-FT6.

https://openalex.org/W1989834944,"Chromium(VI) regulation of gene expression has been attributed to the generation of reactive chromium and oxygen species, DNA damage, and alterations in mRNA stability. However, the effects of Cr(VI) on signal transduction leading to gene expression are not resolved. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of Cr(VI) on basal and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced transcriptional competence of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in A549 human lung carcinoma cells. Pretreatment of A549 cells with nontoxic levels of Cr(VI) inhibited TNF-α-stimulated expression of the endogenous gene for interleukin-8 and of an NF-κB-driven luciferase gene construct, but not expression of urokinase, a gene with a more complex promoter. Chromium did not inhibit TNF-α-stimulated IκBα degradation or translocation of NF-κB-binding proteins to the nucleus. However, Cr(VI) pretreatments prevented TNF-α-stimulated interactions between the p65 subunit of NF-κB and the transcriptional cofactor cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP). This inhibition was not the result of an effect of chromium on the protein kinase A catalytic activity required for p65/CBP interactions. In contrast, Cr(VI) caused concentration-dependent increases in c-Jun/CBP interactions. These data indicate that nontoxic levels of hexavalent chromium selectively inhibit NF-κB transcriptional competence by inhibiting interactions with coactivators of transcription rather than DNA binding. Chromium(VI) regulation of gene expression has been attributed to the generation of reactive chromium and oxygen species, DNA damage, and alterations in mRNA stability. However, the effects of Cr(VI) on signal transduction leading to gene expression are not resolved. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of Cr(VI) on basal and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced transcriptional competence of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in A549 human lung carcinoma cells. Pretreatment of A549 cells with nontoxic levels of Cr(VI) inhibited TNF-α-stimulated expression of the endogenous gene for interleukin-8 and of an NF-κB-driven luciferase gene construct, but not expression of urokinase, a gene with a more complex promoter. Chromium did not inhibit TNF-α-stimulated IκBα degradation or translocation of NF-κB-binding proteins to the nucleus. However, Cr(VI) pretreatments prevented TNF-α-stimulated interactions between the p65 subunit of NF-κB and the transcriptional cofactor cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP). This inhibition was not the result of an effect of chromium on the protein kinase A catalytic activity required for p65/CBP interactions. In contrast, Cr(VI) caused concentration-dependent increases in c-Jun/CBP interactions. These data indicate that nontoxic levels of hexavalent chromium selectively inhibit NF-κB transcriptional competence by inhibiting interactions with coactivators of transcription rather than DNA binding. nuclear factor-κB protein kinase A protein kinase A catalytic subunit cAMP-responsive element-binding protein cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein tumor necrosis factor-α interleukin polymerase chain reaction urokinase-type plasminogen activator polyvinylidene difluoride polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Chromium(VI) promotes pulmonary fibrosis and is a human carcinogen. Cr(VI) affects expression of various genes, including catalase, heme oxygenase, 5-aminolevulinate synthase, and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (1Dudek E.J. Wetterhahn K.E. New J.

These chromium-mediated changes in gene expression are attributed to the generation of reactive chromium and oxygen species, DNA damage, or alterations in mRNA stability. This study examined whether Cr(VI) has additional effects on gene expression at the level of transcription factor activation or transcriptional competence. This type of epigenetic interference with the transcriptional machinery would have profound effects by shifting the patterns of genes expressed without causing molecular damage. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)1 is a mammalian transcription activator protein involved in regulating expression of immune and inflammatory response genes. It occurs in both homo- and heterodimeric forms. The most common transcriptionally competent form is composed of a p50 DNA-binding subunit attached to a p65 transactivation subunit. In nonstimulated cells, NF-κB is localized in the cytoplasm bound to its inhibitor, IκB, and to the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKAc) (4Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Upon cellular activation by cytokines, viral infection, lipopolysaccharide, and reactive oxygen species, IκB is phosphorylated and degraded. This degradation unmasks the ATP-binding site on PKAc, resulting in activation and NF-κB p65 phosphorylation (4Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Furthermore, loss of IκB exposes the NF-κB nuclear localization sequence, allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus and to bind to its consensus sequence within the promoter region of genes. Studies have shown that, in addition to DNA binding, the interaction of p65 with CREB-binding protein (CBP) is essential for NF-κB-enhanced transcriptional activity (5Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 6Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 94: 2927-2932Crossref Scopus (715) Google Scholar). CBP is a coactivator molecule that links enhancer-bound transcription factors (transcription factor IIB and TATA-binding protein) to the basal transcriptional machinery. Interaction of CBP with p65 occurs at two sites. PKAc-induced phosphorylation of p65 on serine 276 mediates the phosphorylation-dependent interaction of p65 with the KIX region of CBP (amino acids 452–661). Alternatively, the C-terminal portion of p65 interacts with CBP in a phosphorylation-independent manner (5Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). In addition to p65, CBP interacts with various other transcription factors, including CREB, c-Jun, c-Fos, p53, glucocorticoid receptor, and retinoid X receptor (7Kwok R.P.S. Lundblad J.R.

Thus, differences in the interaction of p65 with CBP may occur as a result of decreases in p65 phosphorylation or competition between transcription factors for limiting quantities of CBP. In this study, the complex multistep pathway for NF-κB-dependent gene expression was chosen to examine how nontoxic concentrations of Cr(VI) produce epigenetic effects on cell phenotype. The effects of Cr(VI) on both basal and TNF-α-stimulated gene expression were investigated in A549 human lung carcinoma cells. Cr(VI) inhibited both basal and stimulated expression of an NF-κB-driven luciferase reporter construct and the endogenous gene for IL-8. Since there was no effect of Cr(VI) on the pathways that signal for translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus or its DNA binding, the interaction of p65 with CBP was examined. The data obtained indicate that Cr(VI) selectively inhibited this interaction, whereas it increased interactions between CBP and other transcription factors such as c-Jun. Thus, hexavalent chromium selectively disrupts gene expression by altering interactions between specific transcription factors and their cofactors. Unless otherwise stated, A549 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown to 100% confluence at 37 °C and 5% CO2 using nutrient medium F-10 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 60 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The medium was changed on 1-day post-confluent cells prior to treatment. Total cellular RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed on 0.5 μg of the resulting RNA pellet according to previously published methods (3Shumilla J.A. Barchowsky A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 158: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). IL-8 primers (forward, 5′-atgacttccaagctggccgtggct-3′; and reverse, 5′-tctcagccctcttcaaaaacttctc-3′), human uPA primers (forward, 5′-aaaatgctgtgtgctgctgacc-3′; and reverse, 5′-cccgccctgaagtcgttagtg-3′), and β-actin primers (forward, 5′-gggacctgaccgactacctc-3′; and reverse, 5′-gggcgatgatcttgatcttc-3′) were all synthesized in the Dartmouth Molecular Core facility. Cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well and transfected at 70–80% confluence according to the LipofectAMINE Plus protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, 1.5 μg of p55Igκ construct containing three NF-κB repeats placed in front of the minimal interferon-β promoter (−55 to +19) driving the luciferase gene (12Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and 0.5 μg of BioGreen pRK5 mammalian expression vector expressing green fluorescent protein (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) were incubated with Plus reagent for 15 min in serum- and antibiotic-free medium. LipofectAMINE was then added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 15 min. The transfection reagent remained on the cells for 3 h. Following incubation, the medium was changed to antibiotic-free medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and cells were treated 36 h later for 2 or 4 h. The medium was changed after treatment, and luciferase assays were performed 8 h later. Cells were lysed using 250 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm glycylglycine, 4 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgSO4, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and samples were centrifuged. Supernatants (50 μl) were combined with 150 μl of assay buffer (25 mm glycylglycine, 15 mm potassium phosphate, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and relative light units were determined using a luminometer upon addition of 400 μmd-luciferin potassium (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). Total nuclear proteins from supernatants were quantified by Coomassie Plus assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a protein standard. Gel mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (13Barchowsky A. Dudek E.J. Treadwell M.D. Wetterhahn K.E. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 14Shumilla J.A. Wetterhahn K.E. Barchowsky A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Total nuclear proteins were isolated from chromium-treated cells and quantified as described above. Typical protein yields were 0.7–1.1 μg/μl of final nuclear extract. For each sample, 5 μg of total nuclear protein was incubated for 20 min with 10 fmol of 5′-32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the consensus binding sequence for NF-κB (5′-agttgaggggactttcccaggc-3′; Promega, Madison, WI). Samples were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel under nondenaturing, high ionic conditions. Radioactive bands were detected using radiographic film. All primary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and were used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Whole cell extracts were prepared from cells in lysis buffer (25 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 150 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 10 mm sodium fluoride supplemented with protease inhibitors and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) according to previously described procedures (6Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 94: 2927-2932Crossref Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Antibody against p65 (3 μg/ml) was incubated with 20 μl of protein A/G beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Complexes of proteins with p65 were precipitated by combining extracts with the beads and incubating for 16 h at 4 °C. Beads were centrifuged, and pellets washed three times with lysis buffer prior to addition of SDS loading buffer. Samples were resolved on a 7.5% (CBP immunoprecipitate) or 10% (p65 immunoprecipitate) SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Membranes were immunoblotted with affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to p65, CBP, or c-Jun or with monoclonal antibody to PKAc for 60 min in Tween-20/Tris-buffered saline containing 1% powdered milk buffer. Membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse antibody (1:10,000 dilution; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at room temperature. Bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence detection (NEN Renaissance, NEN Life Science Products). For IκB immunoblots, total cell extracts (10 μl) were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and proteins were transferred to a membrane. The membrane was immunoblotted with an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to IκB for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. IκB-specific bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence. The protein kinase A assay was performed according to the assay procedure outlined in the Life Technologies PKA assay system. Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) and protein kinase inhibitor were purchased from BIOMOL Research Labs Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). PKA activity was determined by subtracting the total inhibitable PKA activity from the cAMP-inducible PKA activity. IL-8 mRNA is not expressed basally in A549 cells, and previous work has demonstrated that it is not induced in response to Cr(VI) (15Dubrovskaya V.A. Wetterhahn K.E. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of Cr(VI) on induced IL-8 mRNA, cells were either cotreated for 2 h with Cr(VI) and TNF-α or pretreated with Cr(VI) for 2 h prior to addition of TNF-α for an additional 2 h. Cotreatment with 5 or 20 μm Cr(VI) had no effect on IL-8 mRNA levels (Fig. 1 A). Alternatively, pretreatment for 2 h with concentrations of Cr(VI) as low as 5 μm significantly decreased TNF-α-stimulated IL-8 mRNA levels (Fig. 1 B). To determine whether the decrease in mRNA levels was specific for IL-8, uPA mRNA levels were examined after pretreatment of the cells with chromium followed by treatment with TNF-α. In contrast to IL-8 expression, pretreatment with 5 μm Cr(VI) had no effect on TNF-α-stimulated uPA mRNA levels. Nevertheless, pretreatment with 20 μmCr(VI), which is toxic in this model (3Shumilla J.A. Barchowsky A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 158: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 16Martin B.D. Schoenhard J.A. Sugden K.D. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), significantly decreased uPA mRNA levels (Fig. 2).FIG. 2Effects of Cr(VI) on TNF-α-stimulated uPA mRNA levels. A549 cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 1, 5, or 20 μm Cr(VI) for 2 h prior to addition of buffer or 10 ng/ml TNF-α. The cells were incubated for an additional 2 h before isolation of total RNA. After reverse transcription, DNA was amplified through 21 or 23 rounds of PCR with primers specific for β-actin or uPA cDNA, respectively. Data represent triplicate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine if the decrease in IL-8 mRNA levels was due to an effect on NF-κB activity, cells were transiently transfected with plasmids containing an NF-κB enhancer region upstream of the interferon-β minimal promoter driving expression of the luciferase gene. Transfected cells were treated for 2 h with 1, 5, or 20 μmCr(VI) or cotreated with the varying concentrations of Cr(VI) and 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 2 h. Treatment of cells with up to 20 μm Cr(VI) alone for 2 h had no effect on luciferase levels, whereas treatment with TNF-α increased luciferase levels 2-fold above control levels (Fig. 3 A). Cotreatment with TNF-α and 5 or 20 μm Cr(VI) resulted in reduction of luciferase levels to 50% as compared with TNF-α-stimulated levels. To confirm equivalent transfection efficiency, a pRK5 plasmid expressing fluorescent green protein was cotransfected into the cells. No differences in transfection efficiency were observed for all treatment groups (data not shown). In contrast to the 2-h treatments with Cr(VI), a 4-h treatment with 5 and 20 μm Cr(VI) decreased luciferase levels in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B). Likewise, pretreatment with 5 and 20 μm Cr(VI) prior to addition of TNF-α decreased luciferase levels by 50 and 75%, respectively, as compared with TNF-α-stimulated luciferase levels alone. To demonstrate that the concentrations of Cr(VI) used to treat the cells had no effect on luciferase enzyme activity or did not significantly impair the cellular transcriptional machinery, cells were transfected with a pGL3 plasmid containing an SV40 enhancer and promoter and were treated with varying concentrations of Cr(VI). Consistent with previous demonstrations of toxicity in this model (3Shumilla J.A. Barchowsky A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 158: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar,16Martin B.D. Schoenhard J.A. Sugden K.D. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), 20 μm Cr(VI) decreased luciferase expression as compared with untreated controls or cells treated with 10 μm Cr(VI) or less (Fig. 3 C). Decreased expression may be caused by either DNA damage or inhibition of protein synthesis (3Shumilla J.A. Barchowsky A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 158: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 16Martin B.D. Schoenhard J.A. Sugden K.D. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To determine if a lack of NF-κB nuclear translocation or DNA binding was responsible for the decrease in transcriptional activity, cells were treated with 5, 10, or 20 μm Cr(VI) for 1, 2, or 4 h, and nuclear proteins were analyzed using gel mobility shift assay. All concentrations of Cr(VI) up to 20 μm had no effect on NF-κB nuclear translocation or binding to its DNA consensus sequence (Fig. 4 A). Similarly, cotreatment or pretreatment with 20 μm Cr(VI) had no effect on TNF-α-stimulated NF-κB nuclear translocation (Fig. 4 B). Finally, the effect of chromium on TNF-α-induced degradation of IκB was examined to demonstrate whether chromium affected the signal transduction leading to IκB degradation or the degradation process itself. Chromium did not affect IκB protein levels under basal conditions (Fig. 5 B). Pretreatment with chromium also had no effect on TNF-α-stimulated IκB degradation. These data indicate that Cr(VI) inhibits NF-κB-dependent gene expression at the level of preventing transcriptional competence, not at the level of translocation or DNA binding.FIG. 5Effects of Cr(VI) on TNF-α-induced IκB degradation and p65/CBP interactions. A, cells were incubated in the absence or presence of Cr(VI) for 2 h prior to adding TNF-α to the indicated groups. After an additional 2 h, total protein lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated (IP) with antibody specific for CBP. The immunoprecipitated proteins were then separated by PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and immunoblotted (IB) for either CBP or p65. B, a portion of the total protein lysate was separated by PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and then immunoblotted for IκB. Antibody-antigen complexes were detected by binding to secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Transcriptional competence of NF-κB requires interaction with CBP (7Kwok R.P.S. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G.E. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of chromium on this interaction, cells were incubated with Cr(VI) alone or with TNF-α after a 2-h pretreatment with Cr(VI). Total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody to CBP, and then the resulting proteins were probed for the presence of p65. The data in Fig. 5 indicate that preincubating the cells with either 5 or 20 μm Cr(VI) prior to adding TNF-α significantly decreased stimulated p65/CBP interactions. No interaction between p65 with CBP was observed in the absence of TNF-α stimulation. It is interesting to note that the lack of basal p65/CBP interactions correlates well with the lack of basal IL-8 expression shown in Fig. 1. This may explain why there is no basal IL-8 expression even though there are basal levels of NF-κB-binding proteins in the nucleus (Fig. 4). PKAc-mediated phosphorylation of the p65 subunit is required for interaction of p65 with CBP. p65-associated PKA activation is dependent upon IκB degradation (4Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), which was not affected by Cr(VI) (Fig. 5 B). To determine if the decreased interaction of p65 with CBP was due to a Cr(VI)-induced decrease in PKA catalytic activity, cells were treated with TNF-α or pretreated with 5 and 20 μm Cr(VI) prior to treatment with TNF-α. Total cAMP-inducible PKA activity was not inhibited by any of the treatments examined (Fig. 6 A). The form of PKA responsible for phosphorylating p65 directly interacts with the p65 subunit. To confirm that there were no effects on this interaction, p65 was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by Western analysis with primary antibody specific for PKAc. Chromium did not affect the interaction of p65 with PKAc (Fig. 6 B). The effect of Cr(VI) on CBP interactions with c-Jun were investigated to determine whether disruption of p65/CBP interactions was a specific or a general inhibition of CBP binding activity. The experimental paradigm in Fig. 5 was repeated, and immunoprecipitated proteins were immunoblotted for the presence of c-Jun. As shown in Fig. 7 A, Cr(VI) stimulated c-Jun/CBP interactions in a concentration-dependent manner. There were minimal TNF-α-induced increases in c-Jun/CBP interactions. However, there was no difference in the effect of Cr(VI) on c-Jun/CBP interactions in the absence or presence of TNF-α (Fig. 7 A). In a separate experiment, chromium was added for 2 or 4 h to demonstrate whether an increase in total c-Jun protein accounted for the chromium-induced increase in c-Jun/CBP interactions. The data in Fig. 7 B indicate that chromium treatment either caused no change or slightly decreased total c-Jun protein relative to β-actin. This decrease was evident only after the 4-h exposure and may have resulted from reversible, Cr(VI)-induced inhibition of protein synthesis, which has been described in this cell model (3Shumilla J.A. Barchowsky A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 158: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Metal-induced cellular and molecular events are complex and highly concentration-dependent. Previous studies have demonstrated that metals such as Cr(VI) affect gene expression, both positively and negatively, through mechanisms that depend on induced changes in both DNA and protein structures (2Hamilton J.W. Wetterhahn K.E. Mol. Carcinog. 1989; 2: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Shumilla J.A. Wetterhahn K.E. Barchowsky A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Wetterhahn K.E. Hamilton J.W. Aiyar J. Borges K.M. Floyd R. Biol. Trace Elem. Res. 1989; 21: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). High concentrations of several metals, including Cr(VI), disrupt in vitro DNA binding of NF-κB primarily through modification of protein thiols, rather than changes in the DNA cis-elements (14Shumilla J.A. Wetterhahn K.E. Barchowsky A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The data in this study suggest that, in addition to promoting structural changes in DNA or protein motifs that bind DNA, Cr(VI) alters specific protein/protein interactions that regulate transcriptional competence. In this manner, Cr(VI) may change the dynamic balance of transcription factor interactions with cofactors that are required for integrating gene expression. NF-κB is required for transcriptional activation of a variety of inflammatory genes, and activation of NF-κB is a primary mechanism for cytokine-induced cytokine expression (18Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A549 cells respond well to TNF-α stimulation with increased NF-κB activity and induction of a variety of genes, including IL-8 and uPA (FIG. 1, FIG. 2, FIG. 3, FIG. 4). IL-8 was chosen as a model gene to study the effects of Cr(VI) on NF-κB-dependent gene expression since mutation analysis has demonstrated that removal of the NF-κB site between −94 and −71 base pairs in the promoter eliminates TNF-α and IL-1 induction of IL-8 mRNA (18Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Matsusaka T. Fujikawa K. Nishio Y. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10193-10197Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). IL-8 mRNA is not expressed in nonstimulated A549 cells and is not induced by treatment with Cr(VI) (15Dubrovskaya V.A. Wetterhahn K.E. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the lack of a chromium effect on IL-8 expression and protein levels in other lung epithelial cell lines (20Samet J.M. Graves L.M. Quay J. Dailey L.A. Devlin R.B. Ghio A.J. Wu W. Bromberg P.A. Reed W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L551-L558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, pretreatment of cells with Cr(VI) prior to adding TNF-α decreased stimulated IL-8 expression. Adding Cr(VI) simultaneously with TNF-α had no effect on cytokine-stimulated IL-8 expression. This implies that either Cr(VI) or a reactive metabolite must modify its cellular target prior to activation of the cytokine signaling cascade, otherwise TNF-α signaling bypasses the inhibition. It is possible that TNF-α-stimulated association of transcriptional protein complexes protects reactive sites from modification by reactive chromium species. However, the data in Fig. 3 argue against this since cotreatment was partially effective in preventing induced expression of p55Igκ. This enhanced sensitivity of p55Igκ to chromium relative to IL-8 may reflect a greater accessibility of plasmid DNA and transcriptional complexes to reactive chromium. Nevertheless, these data indicate the selectivity of the chromium effect for NF-κB-driven expression and suggest that further investigation is needed to fully elucidate the mechanism of chromium action on more complex endogenous promoters. The effect of Cr(VI) pretreatment on NF-κB-enhanced gene expression is limited to the level of NF-κB transcriptional competence. Cr(VI) has no effect on TNF-α signaling or its ability to activate gene transcription. Cr(VI) did not affect basal or TNF-stimulated IκB degradation (Fig. 6). Degradation of IκB is required for both release of NF-κB from cytoplasmic stores and phosphorylation of the p65 subunit by PKAc (4Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Neither PKAc activity (Fig. 5) nor NF-κB translocation and DNA binding (Fig. 4) was affected by Cr(VI). These data are consistent with previous studies that demonstrated that concentrations of Cr(VI) less than 5 μm increased NF-κB nuclear translocation in Jurkat cells, whereas concentrations of 5 μm or more had no stimulatory effect (21Chen F. Ye J. Zhang X. Rojanasakul Y. Shi X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 338: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Hida K. Shindoh M. Yasuda M. Hanzawa M. Funaoka K. Kohgo T. Amemiya A.

In addition, TNF-α-induced uPA expression (Fig. 2) and expression of the generic pGL3 control plasmid (Fig. 3) were not inhibited by pretreatment with Cr(VI) unless a toxic concentration of the metal (20 μm) was added. Chromium does alter DNA synthesis (23,24) and inhibits enzyme activities (25Tian L. Lawrence D.A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 141: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 26Shainkin-Kestenbaum R. Caruso C. Berlyne G.M. J. Trace Elem. Electrolytes Health Dis. 1991; 5: 197-201PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mattagajasingh S.N. Misra H.P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 142: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) at the higher concentrations. However, the data in this study indicated that lower concentrations of chromium did not affect cytokine signaling cascades and did not cause global, nonspecific changes in transcriptional competence, in general, or in cytokine-induced gene expression. However, these lower concentrations effectively inhibited NF-κB-dependent gene expression. Cells transfected with the p55Igκ plasmid containing the NF-κB sites had increased luciferase levels above cells transfected with the empty p55luc plasmid (data not shown). Cr(VI) inhibited both basal and stimulated promoter activities in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3). As discussed above, this implies that reactive chromium modifies the interactions of p65/p50 with other transcriptional proteins. Acetylation of N-terminal histone tails associated with genomic DNA is crucial for transcription factor accessibility to nucleosomal templates. Transcriptional competence is conferred when p65 interacts with coactivators that bear acetyltransferase activity. CBP promotes this interaction by linking transcription factor IIB, TATA-binding protein, and histone acetyltransferases with p65 (28Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). It is possible that CBP is modified by a product of intracellular chromium metabolism such as Cr(III), which has been shown to bind tridentate amino acid residues and proteins (29Zhitkovich A. Voitkun V. Costa M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7275-7282Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 30Miller C.A. Costa M. Mol. Carcinog. 1988; 1: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 31Miller C.A. Costa M. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, chromium could have decreased the interaction of p65 with CBP by directly modifying CBP and altering its structure or p65 recognition sequences. The data in Fig. 7 may argue against CBP being the molecular target of Cr(VI) and against direct modification of either p65 or CBP. These data support the alternative hypothesis that Cr(VI) up-regulated levels of other transcription factors that competitively or noncompetitively inhibit p65 binding to CBP. CBP maintains contact with transcription factors through both the C- and N-terminal amino acids, thus allowing it to interact with several proteins in transcriptional complexes at the same time (11Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

However, CBP is often present in limiting amounts, and competition for CBP binding provides a level of transcriptional regulation and integration (33Lee S.K. Kim H.J. Na S.Y. Kim T.S. Choi H.S.

Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of serine 276 by PKA allows p65 to unhinge. Serine 276 then associates with the CBP KIX domain (amino acids 452–661). The KIX domain is also the binding site for phosphorylated CREB and c-Jun (5Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 8Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H.

Over the 4-h exposure period, Cr(VI) selectively increased the binding of CBP to c-Jun/AP-1 (Fig. 7) relative to p65. There was no basal binding of either p65 or c-Jun to CBP, which accounts for the low level of expression of IL-8, uPA, and p55Igκ (FIG. 1, FIG. 2, FIG. 3). With c-Jun bound to the KIX domain, the access of p65, translocated and phosphorylated in response to TNF-α, would be limited. This would explain the reduced ability of TNF-α to induce p55Igκ and IL-8 expression, which are dependent on NF-κB transcriptional competence (12Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 19Matsusaka T. Fujikawa K. Nishio Y. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10193-10197Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). In contrast, the TNF-α-induced uPA expression can be enhanced by a variety of transcription factors, including AP-1 (36Lengyel E. Klostergaard J. Boyd D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1268: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is important to note that Cr(VI) alone has a minimal effect on uPA mRNA levels that results from message stabilization (3Shumilla J.A. Barchowsky A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 158: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The mechanism for increased c-Jun binding to CBP under the conditions of this study is unclear. The data in Fig. 7 B indicate that Cr(VI) does not increase and may decrease total c-Jun protein levels over the 4-h exposure period. This suggests that Cr(VI) has a specific effect on the pathways that signal for c-Jun interactions with CBP. Limited exposures of lung cells to very high concentrations (500 μm) of Cr(VI), Cr(III), or certain other metals activate mitogen-activated protein kinases (20Samet J.M. Graves L.M. Quay J. Dailey L.A. Devlin R.B. Ghio A.J. Wu W. Bromberg P.A. Reed W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L551-L558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, chromium modestly increases phosphorylation of c-Jun (20Samet J.M. Graves L.M. Quay J. Dailey L.A. Devlin R.B. Ghio A.J. Wu W. Bromberg P.A. Reed W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L551-L558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is no increase in IL-8 expression in response to these high levels of chromium relative to other metals (20Samet J.M. Graves L.M. Quay J. Dailey L.A. Devlin R.B. Ghio A.J. Wu W. Bromberg P.A. Reed W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L551-L558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, 5 μm Cr(VI) was sufficient to increase c-Jun/CBP binding and to prevent p65/CBP interactions and NF-κB-dependent gene expression. It is not clear whether this concentration of Cr(VI) is sufficient to activate mitogen-activated protein kinases. An alternative hypothesis that would not require phosphorylation of c-Jun to increase its interaction with CBP would be that these levels of Cr(VI) inhibit the synthesis of a protein that sequesters c-Jun from CBP. Bannister et al. (35Bannister A.J. Oehler T. Wilhelm D. Angel P. Kouzarides T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2509-2514PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that, whereas Ser63 and Ser73 are necessary for c-Jun binding to CBP in vitro, prior phosphorylation of Ser63and Ser73 is not. These authors speculated that phosphorylation is required to remove a repressor protein from c-Jun, which sterically hinders CBP binding (35Bannister A.J. Oehler T. Wilhelm D. Angel P. Kouzarides T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2509-2514PubMed Google Scholar). Additional studies are needed to determine whether this protein is labile and whether its levels are affected by the inhibitory effect of Cr(VI) on protein synthesis in this model (3Shumilla J.A. Barchowsky A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 158: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Furthermore, more detailed studies will be required to investigate the time course and stoichiometry of Cr(VI)-induced interactions of c-Jun with CBP, the mechanisms for these interactions, and whether a stoichiometric change in this interaction explains competitive inhibition of p65 binding with CBP. In conclusion, this study has identified a novel mechanism through which Cr(VI) alters inducible gene expression. Cr(VI) inhibition of p65/CBP interactions shifts the pattern of genes expressed in response to TNF-α away from those enhanced by NF-κB. At the cellular level, loss of NF-κB transcriptional competence could have profound consequences on cell survival and expression of genes essential for innate immune responses such as essential cytokine expression. This loss of NF-κB-dependent gene expression may underlie some of the profibrotic nature of Cr(VI) in the lung."

This enzyme utilizes long chain fatty acyl-coenzyme A and cholesterol as the two substrates, to catalyze the formation of cholesteryl esters and coenzyme A (for a recent review, see Ref. 1Chang T.Y. Chang C.C.Y. Cheng D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 613-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In various cell types, ACAT is responsible for producing essentially all of the cytoplasmic cholesteryl esters. Cholesterol as a polar lipid partitions in the cell membranes, while cholesteryl ester as a neutral lipid aggregates in the cell cytoplasm and forms lipid droplets. A main function of ACAT is believed to guard against the toxic buildup of unesterified cholesterol in the cell membranes. In specialized cell types such as hepatocytes and intestinal enterocytes, cholesteryl esters along with triacylglycerol constitute the majority of the neutral lipid core in lipoproteins (i.e.very low density lipoproteins and chylomicrons; for recent reviews, see Refs. 2Dietschy J.M.

The physiological functions of these two enzymes in various species are currently under investigation in several laboratories. The results from immunodepletion analysis suggest that in humans, ACAT-1 protein is responsible for most of the ACAT activities present in the homogenates of various adult tissues/cells examined, including liver, hepatocytes, HepG2 cells, adrenal gland, macrophages, kidney, but not intestines (9Lee O. Chang C.C.Y. Lee W. Chang T.Y. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1722-1727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether the intestinal ACAT is mainly due to the presence of ACAT-2 enzyme is under investigation. A consensus octanucleotide sequence element, designated as the sterol response element, is present within the promoter regions of many sterol-sensitive genes (reviewed in Refs. 10Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4548) Google Scholar and 11Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3000) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed that the sterol response element-like sequence is not present in the ACAT-1 promoters (12Li B.L. Li X.L. Duan Z.J. Lee O. Lin S. Ma Z.M. Chang C.C.Y. Yang X.Y. Park J.P.

Previous studies have shown that the main mode of regulation of ACAT-1 by sterol in various cell types is at the posttranslational level (reviewed in Ref. 1Chang T.Y. Chang C.C.Y. Cheng D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 613-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Recently, we have purified the recombinant ACAT-1 enzyme to homogeneity with retention of catalytic activity. The cholesterol substrate saturation curves of the purified enzyme, assayed in either mixed micelles or reconstituted vesicles, are both highly sigmoidal. In contrast, the oleoyl-coenzyme A substrate saturation curves of the enzyme assayed under the same conditions are both hyperbolic. These results support the hypothesis that ACAT-1 is an allosteric enzyme regulated by cholesterol, i.e. cholesterol may serve as an activator as well as a substrate for the enzyme (1Chang T.Y. Chang C.C.Y. Cheng D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 613-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). To further examine the molecular mechanism that causes ACAT-1 to be regulated by cholesterol, it is essential to dissect the enzyme structure at the biochemical level. Human ACAT-1 is an integral membrane protein; when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, it spans the endoplasmic reticulum membranes seven times (13Lin S. Cheng D. Liu M.-S. Chen J. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23276-23285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The subunit composition of the enzyme in intact cells and in vitro remains unknown. In this report, by using several independent methods, we have determined that ACAT-1 in intact cells andin vitro exists as a homotetrameric enzyme. CHAPS, taurocholate, fetal bovine serum (FBS), various protein standards used for gel filtration chromatography and for sucrose gradient centrifugation, mouse and rabbit IgGs, Sephacryl S-400HR, and Sepharose CL-6B resins were from Sigma.

The HisACAT-1 cells were transfected with the construct ACAT1-HA1 (13Lin S. Cheng D. Liu M.-S. Chen J. Chang T.Y. J. Biol.

Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were solubilized with 1 ml of 1% DOC in Buffer A (50 mmTris, and 1 mm EDTA, pH.8.3). The lysates were cleared by passing through a 21-gauge needle 10 times. When indicated, lysate mixtures were prepared by mixing 0.5 ml of lysate from each cell type. Unless indicated, all subsequent procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was precleared by mixing with 20 μg of irrelevant mouse IgG for 1 h and then with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B in Buffer A (1:1 in volume) for 1 h. The mixing was with an orbital shaker (Bellco). The supernatants were isolated by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 2 min, after which 2 μg of anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody IgG (Babco) or 3 μg of anti-T7 mouse monoclonal antibody IgG (Novagen) was added to the supernatants, respectively. The samples were mixed for 2 h; 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B were added; and the samples were further mixed for 1 h, then pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 2 min, and washed three times with Buffer A. Each wash included a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, with samples gently reverted by hand two or three times during the incubation, and a 30-min mixing at 4 °C by gentle rotation on orbital shaker. After the washes, the bound ACAT protein was dissociated by adding 40 μl of 5× sample loading buffer (10% SDS, 250 mm dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. After pelleting by rapid centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, all of the recovered supernatant was used for analysis by 10% SDS-PAGE. This was based on a procedure previously published (15Chang C.C.Y. Chen J. Thomas M. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S. Pape M.E. Chang T.Y. J. Biol.

Cells were seeded in medium A and grown in 25-cm2 flasks to approximately 70% confluence, washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline, and fed 1.5 ml/flask methionine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 35 mg/liter l-proline and 10% dialyzed FBS for 1 h. 10 μl/flask (at 10.5 μCi/μl) Tran35S-label was added, and incubated for 12 h. Cell lysates were prepared and precleared in the same manner as described in the previous section. To the precleared supernatant, 5 μl/tube anti-ACAT-1 antibodies DM10 (at 0.3 μg/μl) was added and the mixture was gently rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. Then 50 μl/tube protein A-Sepharose beads were added, and the mixture was rotated for another 60 min. The immune complex was pelleted, washed, solubilized, and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE as described in the previous section. The experiments were conducted at 4 °C. A 0.8-ml sample was applied onto a Sephacryl-400HR or a Sepharose CL-6B column (1.5 × 35 cm), pre-equilibrated with 1% DOC/Buffer A, or 0.5% CHAPS/1 mKCl/Buffer A as indicated. The sample was eluted using the same buffer at 20 ml/h; 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Proteins of known Stokes radii as indicated were used as standards, and were detected by measuring the absorbance of each collected fraction at 280 nm. To monitor the ACAT-1 elution profile, fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-ACAT-1 antibodies DM10. The experiments were conducted at 4 °C. The centrifugations were carried out using a Beckman SW 60 Ti rotor in a Beckman model L8–55M ultracentrifuge. A 3.6-ml solution consisting of a 5–30% linear sucrose gradient was formed in an Ultra-Clear™ tube (Beckman no. 344062). A 200-μl sample was layered on top of the gradient. For gradients in DOC, the centrifugations were at 50,000 rpm for 10 h (in H2O) or 14 h (in D2O). For gradients in CHAPS/1 m KCl, the centrifugations were at 50,000 rpm for 10 h (in H2O) or 16 h (in D2O). At the end of the centrifugation, 38 fractions were collected at 100 μl/fraction. The migration profiles of reference proteins and HisACAT-1 were determined as described in the previous section. ACAT-1-detergent complex (M c) was calculated from the Stokes radius (Rs), partial specific volume (υc), and sedimentation coefficient (s 20,w) using Equation 1 (20Meunier J.C. Olsen R.W. Changeux J.P. FEBS Letters. 1972; 24: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). M=6πNη20,wRss20,w1−υρ20,w(Eq. 1) To calculate the Stokes radius (Rs) of the ACAT-1-detergent complex, gel filtration chromatography experiments were conducted, and the distribution coefficient,K av, was calculated from the equationK av = (Ve −Vo)/(Vt −Vo), where Ve is the elution volume of each reference protein or the ACAT-1 detergent complex. The Stokes radius of the ACAT-1- detergent complex was determined by interpolation using a calibration curve, which was constructed by plotting Stokes radii of reference proteinsversus (−log K av)1/2according to the relationship (−logK av)1/2 = α (β +Rs) (21Laurent T.C. Killander J. J. Chromatog. 1964; 14: 317-330Crossref Google Scholar). The partial specific volume of the ACAT-1-detergent complex was calculated by performing sucrose density gradient centrifugation experiments in H2O and in D2O. The calculation was according to Equation 2 (Equation 9 in Ref. 22O'Brien R.D. Timpone C.A. Gibson R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 86: 602-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). υA=(1−υBρDB)−α(1−υBρHB)ρHA(1−υBρDB)−αρDA(1−υBρHB)(Eq. 2) υ A and υ B are the partial specific volumes of the ACAT-1-detergent protein complex (A) and a reference protein (B), respectively. α = YDB Y HA/Y HB Y DA, where Y is the migration distance of the protein peak in the sucrose gradient in H2O (Y H) or in D2O (Y D). ρ represents the density of the sucrose gradient in H2O or in D2O at half-distance of migration Y of a given protein. To calculate ρ, standard curves of densities versusrefractive indexes of various sucrose stock solutions in 1% DOC or in 0.5% CHAPS and 1.0 m KCl, in H2O or in D2O, densities ranging from 1.03 to 1.20, were constructed; the refractive indexes of the stock solutions were measured by using a refractometer. After each sucrose density gradient centrifugation experiment, the refractive index of each fraction was measured; the density of each fraction was determined by interpolation from the standard curve. The sedimentation coefficient of the ACAT-1-detergent complex was calculated according to Equation 3 (Equation 14 of Ref.22O'Brien R.D. Timpone C.A. Gibson R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 86: 602-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). s20,wA=YA(1−υAρ20,w)(1−υBρt,mB)YB(1−υBρ20,w)(1−υAρt,mA)·s20,wB(Eq. 3) Aldolase, β-amylase, and catalase were used as the reference proteins. The weight fraction of ACAT-1 in the protein-detergent complex (X p) was calculated using the equationX p= (υc − υd)/(υp − υd) (23Clarke S. Smigel M.D. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 696-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). υp is the partial specific volume of HisACAT-1, calculated from its amino acid composition (24McMeekin T.L. Marshall K. Science. 1952; 116: 142-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). υd is partial specific volume of the detergent. For DOC, υd = 0.78 cm3/g (25Tanford C. Nozaki Y. Reynolds J.A. Makino S. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar); for CHAPS, υd = 0.81 cm3/g (26Hjelmeland L.M. Nebert D.W. Osborne J.C.J. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Experiments were conducted at 37 °C. HisACAT-1 cells were seeded in six-well dishes and grown overnight in F-12 medium with 10% FBS, to approximately 80% confluence. One h before cross-linking, cells were given a fresh medium change. DSP was added directly into the 1-ml medium from a 250 mm DSP stock (freshly prepared in Me2SO). The final Me2SO concentration in the medium was adjusted to 1%. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4); the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline twice, and lysed with 500 μl of 10% SDS. A 100-μl amount of 5× SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer (without reducing agent) was added to 300 μl of lysate, and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. A 150-μl amount of the final mixture was subjected to a non-reducing SDS-PAGE (6% separating gel, and 3% stacking gel) and Western blot analysis with anti-ACAT-1 antibodies DM10. To perform cross-linking using cells under cholesterol starvation, HisACAT-1 cells were seeded in medium A for one day, grown in medium D for 2 days, then grown in medium S for 8 h. Experiments were performed at room temperature. Insect High Five cells were cultured in six-well dishes in Grace's medium with or without 12.5% FBS. Cells were infected with high titer HisACAT-1 virus for 36–48 h. Infected cells were harvested by gentle pipetting, washed with Hanks' buffer twice, then resuspended in 1 ml of Hanks' buffer. Cross-linking with DSP and analysis by SDS-PAGE were performed as described above. Experiments were performed at 37 °C. 20 μl of HisACAT-1 purified to near homogeneity (see below), containing approximately 0.1 μg/tube, was employed. The enzyme was diluted to 1 ml/tube in buffer A containing 0.5% CHAPS and 1 m KCl. The cross-linkings with DSP at indicated concentrations were performed for 20 min as described above. The purified ACAT-1 protein samples were prepared from crude extracts of HisACAT-1 cells, based on the enzyme purification procedure published previously (19Chang C.C.Y. Lee C.Y.G. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35132-35141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To avoid the presence of 0.5 m imidazole (which interferes with the cross-linking reaction) in the final sample, it was necessary to modify the original purification scheme by employing the nickel affinity column chromatography step before the ACAT-1 monoclonal antibody affinity column chromatography step. Its purity is approximately 60–70%, based on analysis by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. The recombinant ACAT-1 protein containing the 6-histidine tag and the T7 tag at the N terminus (designated as HisACAT-1; Ref.19Chang C.C.Y. Lee C.Y.G. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23276-23285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), could be expressed in mutant CHO cells deficient in ACAT. Transfectant clones stably expressing the HisACAT-1 protein or the ACAT1-HA1 protein (designated as the HisACAT-1 cells or the ACAT1-HA1 cells) have been isolated (13Lin S. Cheng D. Liu M.-S. Chen J. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23276-23285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Chang C.C.Y. Lee C.Y.G. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35132-35141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To examine whether the ACAT1-HA1 protein can associate with the HisACAT-1 protein within the same cell, we expressed the ACAT1-HA1 protein in the HisACAT-1 cells by transient transfection using the construct ACAT1-HA1 (13Lin S. Cheng D. Liu M.-S. Chen J. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23276-23285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), then performed immunoprecipitation experiments using the anti-HA antibody. The results show that the anti-HA antibody co-immunoprecipitated both the ACAT1-HA1 protein and the HisT7ACAT-1 protein (Fig. 1 A,lane 2). Control experiments show that the anti-HA antibody failed to immunoprecipitate any HisACAT-1 protein from extracts of HisACAT-1 cells (Fig. 1 A, lane 3); the same antibody efficiently immunoprecipitated the ACAT1-HA1 protein from extracts of ACAT1-HA1 cells (Fig. 1 A,lane 4). When we mixed the extracts of HisACAT-1 cells and the extracts of ACAT1-HA1 cells in vitro, then performed the immunoprecipitation using the anti-HA antibody, we found that the anti-HA antibody could only immunoprecipitate the ACAT1-HA1 protein but not the HisACAT-1 protein (Fig. 1 A,lane 5). In additional experiments, we expressed the HisACAT-1 protein in the ACAT1-HA1 cells by transient transfection using the construct HisACAT-1, then performed various immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-T7 monoclonal antibody. The results (shown in Fig. 1 B) fully corroborated the results shown in Fig. 1 A. Together, these results demonstrate that the ACAT-1 protein can form homo-oligomers in intact CHO cells but notin vitro. Additional evidence showed that the ACAT-1 protein expressed in insect cells (14Cheng D. Chang C.C.Y. Qu X. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 685-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) also exists as homo-oligomers (data not shown). To examine the subunit composition of the ACAT-1 enzyme, we labeled cellular proteins by performing 35S metabolic labeling in cells stably expressing untagged ACAT-1 protein (designated as ACAT-1 cells), and the HisACAT-1 cells. We then performed radioimmunoprecipitation experiments. When extracts of ACAT-1 cells were used, the antibodies immunoprecipitated a major labeled protein band identical in size to that of the untagged ACAT-1 protein (50 kDa; Fig. 2, left lane). 2It could be seen from the left lane of Fig. 2 that the antibodies also immunoprecipitated a minor radiolabeled protein band 30–35 kDa in size. The 30–35-kDa band had previously been observed in cells overexpressing human ACAT-1 protein (15Chang C.C.Y. Chen J. Thomas M. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S. Pape M.E. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29532-29540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and was shown to be derived from the 50-kDa band through intracellular protein degradation. Parallel experiment using extracts of metabolically 35S-labeled AC29 cells, showed that no discrete band could be detected (Fig. 2,right lane). This result raised two alternative interpretations; either the ACAT-1 polypeptide forms a homo-oligomer with itself, or the ACAT-1 polypeptide forms a hetero-oligomer with a different polypeptide that exhibits the same apparent molecular weight as the ACAT-1 polypeptide on SDS-PAGE. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we performed an additional radioimmunoprecipitation experiment, using extracts of cells stably expressing HisACAT-1. The result (Fig. 2, middle lane) showed that a single radiolabeled band identical in size to that of the HisACAT-1 protein (54 kDa) was detected; specifically, no discrete band at the 50-kDa region was detectable. This result indicates that the functional ACAT-1 enzyme in intact CHO cells is composed of the ACAT-1 polypeptide only. To determine the molecular weight of the ACAT-1 enzyme in solution, we used DOC-solubilized extracts of insect cells expressing HisACAT-1 as the enzyme source. We first performed gel filtration experiments. A typical elution profile is shown in Fig. 3 A. HisACAT-1/DOC complex exhibited a single peak with a calculated Stokes radius of 8.2 nm ± 0.2 nm (n = 3) (Fig. 3 B). We next performed sucrose density gradient centrifugation experiments in H2O and D2O. Western blot analyses of centrifugation fractions showed that HisACAT-1 sedimented as a sharp peak in H2O and in D2O (Fig. 4, A and B). Based on these results, The hydrodynamic properties of HisACAT-1 in DOC are derived and are summarized in Table I. Based on its amino acid composition, the partial specific volume of the HisACAT-1 protein is 0.75 cm3/g. Assuming the same amount of DOC binds to HisACAT-1 in H2O and in D2O, DOC contributes to approximately 23% by mass in the ACAT-1/DOC complex. The molecular mass of HisACAT-1 protein is estimated to be 280 kDa. Since the predicted monomer size (based on amino acid composition) of the HisACAT-1 polypeptide is 69.4 kDa, this result suggests that HisACAT-1 functions as a homotetramer in DOC. In additional experiments, we have obtained essentially the same results used DOC-solubilized extracts of CHO cells that express HisACAT-1 as the enzyme source (data not shown).FIG. 4Sedimentation profile of HisACAT-1/DOC complex on sucrose density gradients in 1% DOC . Details were described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, in H2O; B, in D2O. The enzyme source was the same as described in Fig. 3. Proteins of known sedimentation coefficients were used as standards: bovine serum albumin (4.5; Ref.23Clarke S.

The presence of 1 m KCl in the buffer has been found to protect ACAT-1 against inactivation by the detergent CHAPS. Therefore, 1 m KCl has been included when CHAPS is used as the detergent. HisACAT-1 solubilized in CHAPS and 1m KCl has been purified to homogeneity with retention of enzyme activity (19Chang C.C.Y. Lee C.Y.G. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35132-35141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To investigate the subunit composition of the HisACAT-1 enzyme solubilized in CHAPS, we performed additional gel filtration chromatography and sucrose density gradient centrifugation experiments. For gel filtration experiments, we used extracts of HisACAT-1 cells as the enzyme source. A typical elution profile is shown in Fig. 5 A. 3In addition to the major peak, minor peaks with smaller Stokes radii were also observed consistently (n= 3). It is possible that during the gel filtration process, the HisACAT-1 solubilized in CHAPS may undergo certain dissociation/alteration processes. Other possibilities cannot be excluded at present. The major peak of HisACAT-1/CHAPS complex exhibits a Stokes radius of 7.2 nm (Fig. 5 B). For sucrose gradient centrifugation experiments, we used HisACAT-1 purified to homogeneity as the enzyme source. Typical sedimentation profiles in H2O and in D2O are shown in Fig. 6(A and B). The hydrodynamic properties of HisACAT-1 in CHAPS are summarized in Table II. In the HisACAT-1/CHAPS complex, CHAPS contributes to approximately 15% by mass. The molecular mass of HisACAT-1 protein is 263 kDa. In additional experiments, we have obtained essentially the same results by using extracts of insect cells expressing HisACAT-1 as the enzyme source (data not shown).FIG. 6Sedimentation profile of HisACAT-1 after sucrose density gradient centrifugation in 0.5% CHAPS and 1.0m KCl.

We chose to use the homo-bifunctional, primary amine-reactive cross-linking agent DSP, because of its high selectivity, moderate spacer length, and membrane permeability. The experiments were first performed in insect cells expressing HisACAT-1. Fig. 7 Ashows a typical result; the increase in DSP concentrations added in the medium causes an increase in size of the HisACAT-1-positive signals, and leads to the formation of material(s) approximately 4 times the size of the monomer. We next performed cross-linking experiments in CHO cells stably expressing HisACAT-1. Cells were grown in medium containing lipoprotein-bound cholesterol, or in cholesterol starvation medium. The results (Fig. 7 B) show that upon cross-linking by DSP, ACAT-1 forms oligomeric material 4 times the size of the ACAT-1 monomer; at intermediate concentration of DSP, additional oligomeric forms, 2 or 3 times the size of the ACAT-1 monomer, can also be detected. These results also show that the ACAT-1 cross-linking pattern is unaltered by changing cholesterol content of the cells. We performed additional cross-linking experiments, using human melanoma cells (15Chang C.C.Y. Chen J. Thomas M. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S. Pape M.E. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29532-29540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) grown in cholesterol-rich medium or in cholesterol-poor medium, and have obtained essentially the same result as shown in Fig. 7 B (data not shown). We next performed chemical cross-linking studies in vitro, using the highly purified HisACAT-1 protein as the source. As shown in Fig. 7 C, without DSP, ACAT-1 migrates mainly as a monomer of 54 kDa; with low concentrations of DSP (5–25 μm), the ACAT forms an oligomer of approximately 4 times its monomer size (200 kDa). This result shows that ACAT-1 in highly purified state maintains as a homotetramer. ACAT-1 is an integral membrane protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. Determining the oligomeric state of an integral membrane protein requires multifaceted approaches. Previously, the oligomeric state of ACAT has been studied by several laboratories; by monitoring the kinetics of decay in enzyme activity upon radiation exposure, earlier studies showed that the minimal molecular mass of ACAT in rat liver microsome ranged from 170 to 224 kDa (27Billheimer J.T. Cromley D.A. Kempner E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8632-8635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Erickson S.K. Lear S.R. McCreery M.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 763-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At present it is not clear whether the ACAT activity in rat liver microsome is mainly derived from ACAT-1, from ACAT-2, or from both. More recently, by using antibodies specific to ACAT-1 to detect ACAT-1 signal in chemical cross-linking studies, Kawasaki et al. (29Kawasaki T. Miyazaki A. Hakamata H. Matsuda H. Horiuchi S. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) showed that ACAT-1 in rat adrenal gland microsome exists as homo- and/or hetero-oligomeric complexes in vitro. In this study, we expressed the hACAT-1 in two different cell types (mutant CHO cells and the insect cells), both devoid of endogenous ACAT. In intact cells, using co-immunoprecipitation, radioimmunoprecipitation, and chemical cross-linking, our results show that hACAT-1 exists as a homotetramer. In addition, using gel filtration chromatography and sucrose density gradient centrifugation in H2O and D2O, as well as chemical cross-linking in vitro, our results show that hACAT-1 present either in crude cell extracts or in purified form also mainly exist as a homotetramer. Our results do not exclude the possibility that in intact cells, a minor portion of the ACAT-1 protein may interact with certain non-ACAT-1 polypeptide(s) and form hetero-oligomeric complex(es). Further experiments are needed to address this issue. We have previously demonstrated that ACAT-1 present in vesicles or in mixed micelles respond to cholesterol as its substrate in sigmoidal manner, implying that ACAT-1 may be an allosteric enzyme regulated by its own substrate cholesterol. The original theory of allostery is based on the idea that cooperative binding of substrates may arise in proteins with two or more structures in equilibrium (reviewed in Ref.30Perutz M.F. Wilkinson A.J. Paoli M. Dodson G.G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar; see also Ref. 31Forsen S. Linse S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 495-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, the only other enzyme reported in literature that responds to a membrane lipid molecule in sigmoidal manner is protein kinase C (which uses phosphatidylserine as an activator (32Newton A.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14909-14915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Orr J.W. Newton A.C.

ACAT-1 spans the endoplasmic reticulum membrane seven times (13Lin S. Cheng D. Liu M.-S. Chen J. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23276-23285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and contains four identical subunits as demonstrated in this report. In contrast, protein kinase C does not contain any membrane-spanning domain and is a monomeric protein (for a review on protein kinase C structure, see Ref. 35Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). Therefore, the apparent allosterism demonstrated by ACAT-1 has no obvious precedence in literature. The molecular mechanism that controls the ACAT-1 allosterism thus represents a major challenge to investigators. In the future, it will be important to identify the structural motif(s) that govern the oligomerization state of ACAT-1, and to examine whether altering the oligomerization state may affect the catalysis, and/or the apparent allosteric property of the enzyme.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that ASP also inhibits hormone-sensitive lipase through an effect on phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) (7Van Harmelen V. Reynisdottir S. Cianflone K. Degerman E.

ASP also stimulates glucose transport in human and murine adipocytes and preadipocytes (2Murray I. Parker R.A. Kirchgessner T.G. Tran J. Zhang Z.J. Westerlund J. Cianflone K. J.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This effect on glucose transport is consequent to translocation of Glut 1 or Glut 3 or Glut 4 (depending on the particular cell). The effects of ASP are likely mediated through interaction with a specific cell surface receptor that demonstrates high affinity binding and tissue-specific distribution (for a review on ASP see Ref. 3Cianflone K. Maslowska M. Sniderman A.D. Semin. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Adipose tissue mass is determined by the rate of the opposing reactions, triglyceride synthesis, and lipolysis. Since ASP stimulates triglyceride synthesis and inhibits lipolysis and does so independently and additively with insulin (4Germinario R. Sniderman A.D. Manuel S. Pratt S. Baldo A. Cianflone K.

Acta. 1997; 1344: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), ASP has the potential to profoundly influence adipose tissue metabolism. ASP is produced through the interaction of complement C3, factor B, and adipsin (10Lesavre P.H. Hugli T.E. Esser A.F. Muller-Eberhard H.J. J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 529-534PubMed Google Scholar, 11Muller-Eberhard H.J. Schreiber R.D. Adv.

The production of ASP by cultured adipocytes is stimulated by chylomicrons (14Maslowska M. Scantlebury T. Germinario R. Cianflone K. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 21-31Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 15Scantlebury T. Maslowska M. Cianflone K. J. Biol.

Although there is substantialin vitro data on ASP production, there have been far lessin vivo studies to date on ASP. In the general circulation there appears to be a slight decrease in ASP over time following a fat load (16Charlesworth J.A. Peake P.W. Campbell L.V. Pussell B.A. O'Grady S. Tzilopoulos T. Int. J. Obes. Rel. Metab. Dis. 1998; 22: 1096-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, generation of ASP does increase postprandially locally across an arterial-venous adipose tissue gradient (17Saleh J. Summers L.K.M. Cianflone K. Fielding B.A. Sniderman A.D. Frayn K.N. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 884-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but not across a muscle gradient. 2A. D. Sniderman and K. Cianflone, unpublished observations. 2A. D. Sniderman and K. Cianflone, unpublished observations. Our hypothesis is that ASP increases the efficiency of dietary energy storage through its cellular effects on lipid and glucose tissue storage. The development of C3 knockout mice (18Circolo A. Garnier G. Fukuda K. Wang X. Tunde H. Szalai A.J. Briles D.E. Volanakis J.E. Wetsel R.A. Colten H.R. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 42: 135-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) allowed us the opportunity to examine the effects of an obligatory ASP knockout (since the precursor to ASP, C3, is absent in mouse plasma) on postprandial metabolism. In our first study on young (8–10 weeks old) male and female mice, we demonstrated increased postprandial triglyceride (TG) in the ASP(−/−) mice in the absence of any change in fasting TG (19Murray I. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1671-1676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These effects were more pronounced in the males than in the females. Conversely, administration of ASP to ASP(−/−) mice (19Murray I. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1671-1676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or to wild type Black6 mice (20Murray I. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E474-E480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) enhanced the clearance of triglyceride and decreased postprandial lipemia. The aim of the present study was to examine the ASP(−/−) phenotype in more detail in a longitudinal study with different diets (10% low fat and 40% high fat). We postulated that the wild type ASP(+/+) mice on the high fat diet would mimic the knockout ASP(−/−) phenotype and that the high fat diet would amplify the effects of the ASP(−/−) phenotype. All experimental protocols were approved by the Royal Victoria Hospital Animal Ethics committee and were in accordance with the guidelines set out by the Canadian Committee on Animal Care. Dr. H. Colten and Dr. R. H. Wetsel kindly provided the knockout and wild type mice for breeding. Development of the complement C3 knockout has been described elsewhere in detail (18Circolo A. Garnier G. Fukuda K. Wang X. Tunde H. Szalai A.J. Briles D.E. Volanakis J.E. Wetsel R.A. Colten H.R. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 42: 135-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar,21Lubinski J.M. Wang L.

The mice were of (129Sv × C57Bl/6) strain, and heterozygous mating produced the littermates (wild type ASP(+/+) and knockout ASP(−/−)) used for the present experiments. Mice were housed in sterile barrier facilities with equal day/night periods. In all cases, littermates were used to randomize genetic variation. For genotyping, tail DNA was extracted, and polymerase chain reaction was performed. Polymerase chain reaction was performed using 800 nm each of the following primers: C3 sense, CTT AAC TGT CCC ACT GCC AAG AAA CCG TCC CAG ATC; C3 antisense, CTC TGG TCC CTC CCT GTT CCT GCA CCA GGG ACT GCC CAA AAT TTC GCA AC; neomycin sense, ATC GCA TCG AGC GAG CAC GTA CTC GGA; neomycin antisense, AGC TCT TCA GCA ATA TCA CGG CTA GCC. Polymerase chain reaction conditions were 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 67 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. Products were separated by electrophoresis on a 7% polyacrylamide gel and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. ASP(+/+) and ASP(−/−) male mice were weighed once weekly from weaning at 4 weeks of age. At 8 weeks, the mice were housed individually and allowed to acclimatize for 2 weeks. At 10 weeks of age, the mice were placed on a pelleted low fat diet (LF) consisting of 19.3% protein, 67.3% carbohydrate, and 4.3% fat (w/w) or high fat diet (HF) consisting of 22.9% protein, 45.8% carbohydrate, and 20.3% fat w/w modified from Van Heek et al. (22Van Heek M. Compton D.S. France C.F. Tedesco R.P. Fawzi A.B. Graziano M.P. Sybertz E.J. Strader C.D. Davis Jr., H.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) and obtained from Research Diets, Inc. (New Brunswick, NJ) (Diets D12477 and D12478, respectively). The diets contained 10% Kcal (LF) and 40% Kcal (HF) energy from fat, with a 1:1:1 ratio of saturated:monounsaturated: polyunsaturated fats and were stored at 4 °C. Carbohydrate was in the form of cornstarch rather than sucrose (70% LF and 40% HF Kcal). The vitamin and mineral content conformed with the AIN (American Institutes of Nutrition) guidelines. The food was weighed 3 times weekly over a period of 16 weeks, and food intake was determined over the time period of 10 to 26 weeks of age. After 1 month on the diet, a fat load was performed, and 2 weeks later a fasting blood samples was taken. The same treatment was repeated at 4 months on the diet (26 and 28 weeks of age). On a subset of mice, a glucose tolerance test was performed at 30 weeks of age, and mice were sacrificed at 32 weeks or 48 weeks. Mice were anesthetized (0.01 ml/10 g of body weight intramuscularly) with a mixture composed of 5 ml of ketamine (100 mg/ml), 2.5 ml of xylazine (20 mg/ml), 1 ml of acepromazine (10 mg/ml), and 1.5 ml of sterile saline. Blood was drawn from the tail (0.5 ml), and the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Tissues were dissected, weighed, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Four adipose tissues depots were collected: inguinal, pectoral and suprascapular together, gonadal fat up to the apex of the ovary, and perirenal adipose tissue with the adrenal gland removed. Additional tissues collected were heart, liver, intrascapular and scapular brown adipose tissue, both kidneys, and quadriceps muscles with all visible fat removed. Blood was collected by tail bleeding into EDTA-containing tubes by tail bleeding as described previously (19Murray I. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1671-1676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Murray I. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E474-E480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from mice fasted overnight (16 h) with water ad libitum at 10, 16, 28, and 32 weeks of age. Blood was separated by centrifugation, and the plasma was stored at −80 °C. Leptin was measured using a mouse leptin radioimmunoassay (Linco Inc. St Charles, MO) as described previously (23Ahren B. Mansson S. Gingerich R.L. Havel P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: R113-R120PubMed Google Scholar). Fasting insulin was measured using a rat insulin radioimmunoassay kit that had 100% cross-reactivity to mouse insulin (as described by the manufacturer, Linco Inc). Glucose was measured using a Trinder glucose kit (Sigma). Plasma free fatty acids (NEFA), cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured using colorimetric enzymatic kits (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After an overnight fast (16 h), 400 μl of olive oil (followed by 100 μl of air) was given by gastric gavage using a feeding tube (1-cm curved ball tipped feeding needle 20), according to standard procedures as published previously (19Murray I.

For glucose tolerance tests, mice were fasted overnight for 16 h with water ad libitum. Basal blood was taken (80 μl), and mice were injected intraperitoneally with a sterile d-glucose solution in saline, 2 mg/g of body weight from a stock solution of 200 mg/ml (0.010 ml/g of body weight). Blood was collected at 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. Insulin and glucose were measured 0, 30, 60, and 120 min (80 μl collected), and glucose only was measured at 15 and 90 min (20 μl collected). Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. The two groups were compared by repeated measures of two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-test or by the area under the curve (AUC) (for time course data), t test, ANOVA (fasting data), or Pearson correlation using computer-assisted analysis (Sigma Stat, Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA and Prism, GraphPad San Diego, CA). Mice were examined at three time points, at 10 weeks of age, 14 weeks of age (after 1 month on a low fat or a high fat diet), and again at 26 weeks of age (after a total of 4 months on a low fat or high fat diet). The diets contained a fixed amount of protein (20%), and as the fat content was increased (10% to 40% of energy), the carbohydrate contribution was proportionally reduced (70 to 40% of energy). Basal fasting lipids for male wild type ASP(+/+) and male knockout ASP(−/−) mice are shown in Table I. Overall there was no change in plasma TG between the wild type ASP(+/+) and ASP(−/−) mice, nor was there any effect of diet or age. Plasma cholesterol (CHOL) on the other hand increased with age and also increased on a high fat diet, as has been reported elsewhere (28Kopecky J. Hodney Z. Rossmeisl M. Syrovy I. Kozak L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E768-E775PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hamann A. Flier J.S. Lowell B.B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 30Hotamisligil G.S. Johnson R.S.

Although there appeared to be a trend toward increased plasma CHOL in the (−/−) mice, especially in the older mice, the differences were not significant and were due primarily to increases in HDL CHOL in the ASP(−/−) knockout with no change in VLDL + LDL CHOL (results not shown). Plasma NEFA decreased with age as seen previously (31Ranheim T. Dumke C. Schueler K.L. Cartree G.D. Attie A.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3286-3293Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), although there was no effect of the high fat diet on these parameters. Although young ASP(−/−) mice (10 weeks old) had higher plasma NEFA and slightly increased VLDL + LDL CHOL versus wild type, as shown previously (19Murray I. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1671-1676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this was not apparent as the mice aged.Table IFasting plasma lipids in ASP (−/−) and ASP (+/+) miceMiceTypeSample sizeTriglycerideCholesterolNEFAmmmmmm10 weeks(+/+)758.5 ± 5.163.0 ± 4.60.87 ± 0.18(−/−)1272.6 ± 11.767.0 ± 4.31.97 ± 0.52ap < 0.05 for (−/−) vs.(+/+) at the indicated age.14 weeks, LF(+/+)951.1 ± 8.991.8 ± 14.40.54 ± 0.09(−/−)753.2 ± 6.774.0 ± 5.10.48 ± 0.0514 weeks, HF(+/+)970.6 ± 7.395.8 ± 7.80.47 ± 0.10(−/−)867.0 ± 5.6105.6 ± 10.40.61 ± 0.1226 weeks, LF(+/+)946.1 ± 6.092.1 ± 6.20.35 ± 0.05(−/−)757.6 ± 4.8108.2 ± 13.90.41 ± 0.0726 weeks, HF(+/+)1065.6 ± 2.6127.7 ± 7.40.29 ± 0.02(−/−)769.9 ± 7.5148.3 ± 20.40.38 ± 0.07a p < 0.05 for (−/−) vs.(+/+) at the indicated age. Open table in a new tab We have previously demonstrated that young male ASP(−/−) mice (8–10 weeks old) demonstrate small but significant delays in TG clearance following a fat load with a 52% increase in TG AUC (19Murray I. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1671-1676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, at 14 weeks of age (on a low fat diet) there is a substantial difference in postprandial TG in the ASP(−/−) as compared with ASP(+/+) (893 ± 279 (−/−)versus 497 ± 90 (+/+) AUC mg/dl·h, an 80% increase,p < 0.02). There is no difference in the NEFA postprandial profile between the two groups (Fig. 1, right panel). The postprandial TG curves after 1 month on the HF diet are shown in Fig. 2. The high fat diet results in a delay in postprandial TG clearance in the ASP(+/+) mice such that the TG AUC increases by 65% versus the ASP(+/+) control on LF (820 ± 149 mg/dl·h, p < 0.01). The postprandial curve of the ASP(−/−) mice slightly increased as compared with the ASP(−/−) on LF diet (1094 ± 242 mg/dl·h AUC). However, in the ASP(−/−) mice on HF there was also a pronounced increase in the postprandial plasma NEFA (2.5 fold) that did not occur in the ASP(+/+) mice on the high fat diet (Fig. 2, right panel).FIG. 2Postprandial lipemia in wild type (+/+) and ASP knockout (−/−) mice on high fat diet. An oral fat load was given to the mice after 1 month on a high fat diet (14 weeks of age) and triglycerides (left panel), and nonesterified fatty acids (right panel) were measured over the 6-h time course for n = 8 ASP(−/−) and n = 10 ASP(+/+). Results are given as average ± S.E. Two-way repeated measures of ANOVA results indicate that there is a significant time (p < 0.01) and genotype (p < 0.04) effect for triglyceride and a significant genotype (p< 0.0003) and time (p < 0.05) effect on plasma nonesterified fatty acids.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) After a total of 4 months on the respective diets, we reexamined postprandial responses in the mice. The results for TG AUC for 10 weeks of age, 1 month on diet (14 weeks of age), and 4 months on diet (26 weeks of age) are shown in Fig. 3. In the ASP(+/+) mice, there are progressive diet-induced increases in TG AUC. In the ASP(−/−) mice there are also marked changes in TG AUC that in most instances are larger than the wild type. The differences in TG AUC between ASP(+/+) and ASP(−/−) are not secondary to differences in basal TG levels, since there is no change in fasting TG levels (Table I). At 1 month (low and high fat diet) and 4 months (low fat diet) the TG AUC in ASP(−/−) is significantly increased compared with ASP(+/+). At 4 months on the high fat diet, the TG AUC for ASP(−/−) is reduced compared with HF ASP(+/+) but is still significantly increased over the LF ASP(+/+) control. The results for NEFA at 4 months are shown in Fig. 4 for low fat (left panel) and high fat (right panel). In the wild type mice, the increase in postprandial NEFA AUC is modest (20.6% increase over basal AUC for LF and 30.8% for HF diet). By contrast, the increase in NEFA in the ASP(−/−) mice is greater than the (+/+) mice, 45% on LF and 70% on HF (p < 0.003 and p < 0.0001, respectively, by two-way repeated measures ANOVA). We also examined glucose and insulin metabolism in the mice. Fasting glucose and insulin are given in Table II. High fat diets are recognized for their effects on inducing insulin resistance and disordered glucose metabolism (28Kopecky J. Hodney Z. Rossmeisl M. Syrovy I. Kozak L. Am. J.

In the ASP(+/+) mice, there is a slight increase in glucose with age, as well as an effect of the high fat diet that increases glucose by 9% on average. There is a similar high fat effect on insulin that increases by 2-fold at both 1 month and 4 months on the diet. In the ASP(−/−) mice, there is a similar increase in insulin with age and diet. However, the ASP(−/−) have significantly lower glucose levels than the wild type at 14 and 26 weeks old at any given insulin level, and this is evidenced by the reduced insulin·glucose product, which is lower in the ASP(−/−) mice. This relationship between insulin and glucose in ASP(+/+) and ASP(−/−) was analyzed by linear regression analysis, and for any given value of insulin, the corresponding glucose is significantly lower in the ASP(−/−) as compared with ASP(+/+) (p < 0.002).Table IIFasting glucose and insulin in ASP (−/−) and ASP (+/+) MiceMiceTypeSample sizeGlucoseInsulinGlucose · Insulinmg/dlng/ml10 weeks(+/+)5112 ± 15.80.32 ± 0.0827 ± 5.5(−/−)1199 ± 14.00.31 ± 0.0328 ± 4.714 weeks, LF(+/+)8113 ± 12.70.20 ± 0.0643.4 ± 16.8(−/−)791 ± 3.9ap < 0.05 for (−/−) vs.(+/+).0.23 ± 0.0220.5 ± 1.614 weeks, HF(+/+)10123 ± 5.60.42 ± 0.1052.6 ± 12.0(−/−)8104 ± 4.0bp < 0.025 for (−/−) vs.(+/+).0.51 ± 0.1146.3 ± 10.026 weeks, LF(+/+)9126 ± 9.10.42 ± 0.0856.1 ± 13.9(−/−)10104 ± 5.8ap < 0.05 for (−/−) vs.(+/+).0.31 ± 0.0331.2 ± 2.5ap < 0.05 for (−/−) vs.(+/+).26 weeks, HF(+/+)10136 ± 8.90.84 ± 0.12111 ± 13.2(−/−)7117 ± 10.30.91 ± 0.2078 ± 11.6ap < 0.05 for (−/−) vs.(+/+).a p < 0.05 for (−/−) vs.(+/+).b p < 0.025 for (−/−) vs.(+/+). Open table in a new tab Postprandial glucose after a fat load at either 1 month or 4 months on LF or HF was no different in ASP(+/+) versus (−/−) (Table III). In a subset of mice we also measured plasma glucose after a glucose tolerance test (GTT) at 4.5 months on LF or HF diet, and again there was no difference in ASP(+/+)versus (−/−) (Table III). There was a clear effect of the high fat diet in both wild type and knockout mice (Table III) where glucose AUC increased 29 to 47% and was significant in all cases. Finally, GTT insulin response increased with a high fat diet in both ASP(+/+) and (−/−) but to a lesser extent in (−/−), and on the LF diet only the insulin response to GTT was significantly lower in ASP(−/−) versus ASP(+/+), p < 0.02.Table IIIPostprandial and GTT, glucose and insulin AUCAssayTypeSample sizeLFHF% IncreasePostprandial glucose (1 month)(+/+)(7 /10)649 ± 57875 ± 6235%, p < 0.0001(−/−)(7 /8)632 ± 67857 ± 7932%,p < 0.0001Postprandial glucose (4 months)(+/+)(9 /9)672 ± 51887 ± 4232%,p < 0.0001(−/−)(7 /7)749 ± 28887 ± 6132%, p < 0.0001GTT glucose (4.5 months)(+/+)(3 /4)287 ± 36423 ± 3447%, p < 0.0001(−/−)(3 /3)330 ± 10371 ± 3429%, p < 0.001GTT insulin(+/+)(3 /4)2.06 ± 0.443.22 ± 0.4357%, p < 0.0001(−/−)(3 /2)1.00 ± 0.13ap < 0.02 for ASP (−/−)vs. ASP (+/+).2.91 ± 0.4990%,p < 0.001a p < 0.02 for ASP (−/−)vs. ASP (+/+). Open table in a new tab We also looked at other factors related to energy nutrient disposition and fat mass: growth curves of the mice, body composition, leptin and food efficiency. The mice were weighed each week from 4 to 26 weeks old, and the food intake monitored over the dietary period (16 weeks from 10 to 26 weeks of age). Although the knockout mice were slightly heavier at all ages versus (+/+) by 9% ± 0.9% (LF) and 4.1% ± 0.3% (HF), the differences were not significant. Total body weight on high fat diets, relative to low fat diet, increased to the same extent in both ASP(+/+) and ASP(−/−) by 22.5% ± 2.1% (+/+) and 18.7% ± 1.7% (−/−) over the 4-month period. Leptin, which correlates very highly to body weight and adipose tissue mass, was measured at several time points from 10 to 32 weeks of age as an index of adiposity in the mice. Leptin increases both with age and with diet in wild type mice, as reported by others (22Van Heek M. Compton D.S. France C.F. Tedesco R.P. Fawzi A.B. Graziano M.P. Sybertz E.J. Strader C.D.

However, as shown in Fig. 5, relative to body weight, there was always significantly less leptin in ASP(−/−) versus (+/+),p < 0.006, suggesting reduced whole body fat. This decrease in leptin was reflected by small but significant decreases in adipose tissue mass (Table IV) particularly in the gonadal and perirenal fat (−26% and −13% (LF), respectively), representing a decrease from 6.3% ASP(+/+) to 4.2% ASP(−/−) fat versus body weight. On the other hand, there was a significant increase in intrascapular brown adipose tissue in the ASP(−/−) mice versus ASP(+/+) on both the low and high fat diets (89 and 39%, respectively, p < 0.05).Table IVWeight of adipose tissue depots in male mice at 8 months of ageLow fat dietHigh fat dietg% Bodyweightg% BodyweightInguinal(+/+)0.883 ± 0.2742.7%2.559 ± 0.0476.1%(−/−)0.834 ± 0.1312.3%2.642 ± 0.1426.2%% decrease−6%−4%Pectoral(+/+)0.758 ± 0.1362.4%1.828 ± 0.2624.3%(−/−)0.711 ± 0.1422.0%2.169 ± 0.1815.1%%"

ERM1proteins are also involved in cell adhesion, influencing the redistribution of various cell adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1 (4Helander T.S. O. Carpén O. Turunen O. Kovanen P.E. Vaheri A.

The amino-terminal domain of ERM proteins, comprising about 300 amino acids, is conserved among the different proteins and merlin and exhibits a high degree of sequence similarity (1Bretscher A.

Nature. 1990; 347: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and it is thought to bind to membrane proteins. In contrast, the interaction of ERM proteins with F-actin seems to involve both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal region (5Mangeat P. Roy C. Martin M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 187-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Merlin, however, lacks the F-actin binding site in the carboxyl terminus, but binds it in a different manner (9Xu H.-M. Gutmann D.H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 51: 403-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).ERM proteins are present in a wide variety of tissues, notably in epithelial cells in culture (10Sato N. Funayama N. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita Sa Tsukita Sh J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 131-143PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to other tissues, less is known about the function of ERM proteins in the nervous system. During development and regeneration, neurons grow over large distances in a process controlled by extrinsic factors and cytoskeleton interactions. Some ERM proteins have been found in the growth cones of neuronal cells (11Gonzalezagosti C. Solomon F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 34: 122-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 12Amieva M.R. Furthmayr H. Exp. Cell. Res. 1995; 219: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), suggesting an effect on neurite outgrowth. Indeed, recently it was shown by an antisense approach, that radixin and moesin are important for growth cone morphology and motility (13Paglini G. Kunda P. Quiroga S. Kosik K. Cáceres A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 443-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although important for dynamic interactions between cytoskeleton and membranes, the mechanism by which ERM proteins mediate their effects on cell motility is not fully understood (5Mangeat P. Roy C. Martin M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 187-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In this study, we have identified a novel ERM-like protein, called myosin regulatory light chain interacting protein (MIR), that binds to the myosin regulatory light chain B (MRLC) (14Taubmann M.B. Grant J.W. Nadal-Ginard B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1505-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and may directly influence cell movements. To study the effect of MIR on cell motility, we have measured neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells which was dramatically inhibited by overexpression of MIR.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have cloned MIR, a novel member of the ERM protein family which is expressed in a variety of different human tissues. In addition to the amino-terminal ERM homology domain, MIR has a carboxyl-terminal RING finger similar to other proteins involved in regulating growth and survival of cells (20Freemont P.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 684: 174-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The ERM and the RING finger domains constitute structural motifs which probably mediate important protein-protein interactions. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified MRLC as a protein interacting with MIR, suggesting a possible role of MIR in the actomyosin complex.ERM proteins associate with proteins both in the plasma membrane and in the cytoskeleton, taking part in the co-ordination of cell motility. According to the present results, an essential function for MIR in transfected PC12 is to influence neurite outgrowth, probably by influencing cytoskeletal components involved in cell motility. MIR interacts with MRLC, which regulates the activity of the actomyosin complex in muscle as well as in nonmuscle cells (21Howard J. Nature. 1997; 389: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Two isoforms of MRLC are present in brain tissue and in cultured neuroblasts (22Feinstein D.L. Durand M. Milner R.J. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 10: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Evidence has recently been provided for the involvement of myosin in neurite outgrowth (23Hasson T. Mosseker M.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Neuronal cells express different forms of myosin including conventional myosin II, present at the leading edge of the growth cones (24Wylie S.R. Wu P.-J. Patel H. Chantler P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12967-12972Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Mouse neuroblastoma cells express both myosin IIA and myosin IIB isoforms, but only the latter seems to be involved in neurite extension (24Wylie S.R. Wu P.-J. Patel H. Chantler P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12967-12972Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In view of the present finding, it is reasonable to assume that MIR, via its interaction with MRLC, can inhibit the driving force of myosin, which controls the actomyosin complex. Previous studies have shown an effect of radixin and moesin on growth cone motility and process formation in neurons (11Gonzalezagosti C. Solomon F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 34: 122-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 12Amieva M.R. Furthmayr H. Exp. Cell. Res. 1995; 219: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Radixin was shown to redistribute to the growth cones following NGF stimulation (11Gonzalezagosti C. Solomon F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 34: 122-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These results suggest an important function for different ERM-like proteins in the control of neurite outgrowth, which may involve an interaction with MIR.The activity of actomyosin complex is known to be regulated by the phosphorylation state of MRLC, which is influenced by the myosin light chain kinase and by the corresponding phosphatase (25Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). Increased MRLC phosphorylation leads to enhanced cell contractility and to increased calcium sensitivity in smooth muscle cells (26Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar). A similar regulation of myosin activity probably occurs in neurons. Recent evidence suggests a critical role for Rho, belonging to the small GTPase Rho family of proteins (27Machesky L.M. Hall A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 304-310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and for its associated Rho p160 kinase (ROCK) in mediating MRLC phosphorylation (26Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that agonist-induced or enhanced Rho/ROCK activity is sufficient for mediating neurite retraction and cell rounding of neuroblastoma cells in culture (28Hirose M. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. Uehata M. Kranenburg O. Moolenar W.H. Matsumura F. Maekawa M. Bito H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). It was suggested that Rho/ROCK activity tonically inhibits cell process extensions via activation of actinomyosin contractility and suppression of the assembly of intermediate filaments and microtubules (28Hirose M. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. Uehata M. Kranenburg O. Moolenar W.H. Matsumura F. Maekawa M. Bito H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested a role for ERM proteins in the activation cascade induced by Rho (5Mangeat P. Roy C. Martin M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 187-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) via a conserved threonine in the carboxyl-terminal region of ERM proteins, which is phosphorylated by ROCK (29Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ERM proteins are thought to contribute to the activation of Rho by sequestering the Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor, which in turn binds the inactive form of Rho (30Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Takaishi K. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23371-23375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar).In view of these mutual interactions between the Rho family members and ERM proteins, it is possible that the function of MIR is linked to alterations in Rho activity. Indeed, microinjection of active ROCK kinase in PC12 cells leads to neurite retraction (31Katoh H. Aoki J. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2489-2492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This is analogous to the effect observed for MIR in transfected PC12 cells, and suggests that MIR functions in parallel to Rho/ROCK in inhibiting neurite extension. The mechanism by which MIR acts may indirectly involve changes in MRLC phosphorylation thereby hindering cytoskeleton interactions promoting neurite outgrowth.MIR may have additional functions in cells, acting as a stabilizing factor for the cytoskeleton by cross-linking various protein components important for the attachment/detachment reactions required for cell motility. In keeping with such a notion, we have recently obtained evidence for the interaction of MIR with other regulatory proteins affecting the cytoskeleton. The nature of these proteins and the role of MIR in regulating cell motility in other cell types than neurons are currently under investigation. Dynamic changes in cell shape and movements involve interactions between proteins in the cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane. Ezrin, radixin, moesin, and the related tumor suppressor merlin link the actin cytoskeleton to membrane-bound proteins located at membrane extension sites, such as microvilli, membrane rufflings, and at cell-cell contacts (1Bretscher A.

Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar). A similar regulation of myosin activity probably occurs in neurons. Recent evidence suggests a critical role for Rho, belonging to the small GTPase Rho family of proteins (27Machesky L.M. Hall A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 304-310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and for its associated Rho p160 kinase (ROCK) in mediating MRLC phosphorylation (26Uehata M. Ishizaki T.

It was recently shown that agonist-induced or enhanced Rho/ROCK activity is sufficient for mediating neurite retraction and cell rounding of neuroblastoma cells in culture (28Hirose M. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. Uehata M. Kranenburg O. Moolenar W.H. Matsumura F. Maekawa M. Bito H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). It was suggested that Rho/ROCK activity tonically inhibits cell process extensions via activation of actinomyosin contractility and suppression of the assembly of intermediate filaments and microtubules (28Hirose M. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. Uehata M. Kranenburg O. Moolenar W.H. Matsumura F. Maekawa M. Bito H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested a role for ERM proteins in the activation cascade induced by Rho (5Mangeat P. Roy C. Martin M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 187-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) via a conserved threonine in the carboxyl-terminal region of ERM proteins, which is phosphorylated by ROCK (29Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ERM proteins are thought to contribute to the activation of Rho by sequestering the Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor, which in turn binds the inactive form of Rho (30Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Takaishi K. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23371-23375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar).In view of these mutual interactions between the Rho family members and ERM proteins, it is possible that the function of MIR is linked to alterations in Rho activity. Indeed, microinjection of active ROCK kinase in PC12 cells leads to neurite retraction (31Katoh H. Aoki J. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2489-2492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This is analogous to the effect observed for MIR in transfected PC12 cells, and suggests that MIR functions in parallel to Rho/ROCK in inhibiting neurite extension. The mechanism by which MIR acts may indirectly involve changes in MRLC phosphorylation thereby hindering cytoskeleton interactions promoting neurite outgrowth.MIR may have additional functions in cells, acting as a stabilizing factor for the cytoskeleton by cross-linking various protein components important for the attachment/detachment reactions required for cell motility. In keeping with such a notion, we have recently obtained evidence for the interaction of MIR with other regulatory proteins affecting the cytoskeleton. The nature of these proteins and the role of MIR in regulating cell motility in other cell types than neurons are currently under investigation. In this study we have cloned MIR, a novel member of the ERM protein family which is expressed in a variety of different human tissues. In addition to the amino-terminal ERM homology domain, MIR has a carboxyl-terminal RING finger similar to other proteins involved in regulating growth and survival of cells (20Freemont P.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 684: 174-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The ERM and the RING finger domains constitute structural motifs which probably mediate important protein-protein interactions. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified MRLC as a protein interacting with MIR, suggesting a possible role of MIR in the actomyosin complex. ERM proteins associate with proteins both in the plasma membrane and in the cytoskeleton, taking part in the co-ordination of cell motility. According to the present results, an essential function for MIR in transfected PC12 is to influence neurite outgrowth, probably by influencing cytoskeletal components involved in cell motility. MIR interacts with MRLC, which regulates the activity of the actomyosin complex in muscle as well as in nonmuscle cells (21Howard J. Nature. 1997; 389: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Two isoforms of MRLC are present in brain tissue and in cultured neuroblasts (22Feinstein D.L. Durand M. Milner R.J. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 10: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Evidence has recently been provided for the involvement of myosin in neurite outgrowth (23Hasson T. Mosseker M.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Neuronal cells express different forms of myosin including conventional myosin II, present at the leading edge of the growth cones (24Wylie S.R. Wu P.-J. Patel H. Chantler P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12967-12972Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Mouse neuroblastoma cells express both myosin IIA and myosin IIB isoforms, but only the latter seems to be involved in neurite extension (24Wylie S.R. Wu P.-J. Patel H. Chantler P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12967-12972Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In view of the present finding, it is reasonable to assume that MIR, via its interaction with MRLC, can inhibit the driving force of myosin, which controls the actomyosin complex. Previous studies have shown an effect of radixin and moesin on growth cone motility and process formation in neurons (11Gonzalezagosti C. Solomon F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 34: 122-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 12Amieva M.R. Furthmayr H. Exp. Cell. Res. 1995; 219: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Radixin was shown to redistribute to the growth cones following NGF stimulation (11Gonzalezagosti C. Solomon F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 34: 122-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These results suggest an important function for different ERM-like proteins in the control of neurite outgrowth, which may involve an interaction with MIR. The activity of actomyosin complex is known to be regulated by the phosphorylation state of MRLC, which is influenced by the myosin light chain kinase and by the corresponding phosphatase (25Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). Increased MRLC phosphorylation leads to enhanced cell contractility and to increased calcium sensitivity in smooth muscle cells (26Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T.

https://openalex.org/W2009009748,"Interleukin 1β (IL-1β) induces expression of the inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) with concomitant release of nitric oxide (NO) from glomerular mesangial cells. These events are preceded by activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) and p38MAPK. Our current study demonstrates that overexpression of the dominant negative form of JNK1 or p54 SAPKβ/JNK2 significantly reduces the iNOS protein expression and NO production induced by IL-1β. Similarly, overexpression of the kinase-dead mutant form of p38αMAPK also inhibits IL-1β-induced iNOS expression and NO production. In previous studies we demonstrated that IL-1β can activate MKK4/SEK1, MKK3, and MKK6 in renal mesangial cells; therefore, we examined the role of these MAPK kinases in the modulation of iNOS induced by IL-1β. Overexpression of the dominant negative form of MKK4/SEK1 decreases IL-1β-induced iNOS expression and NO production with inhibition of both SAPK/JNK and p38MAPKphosphorylation. Overexpression of the kinase-dead mutant form of MKK3 or MKK6 demonstrated that either of these two mutant kinase inhibited IL-1β-induced p38MAPK (but not JNK/SAPK) phosphorylation and iNOS expression. Interestingly overexpression of wild type MKK3/6 was associated with phosphorylation of p38MAPK; however, in the absence of IL-1β, iNOS expression was not enhanced. This study suggests that the activation of both SAPK/JNK and p38αMAPK signaling cascades are necessary for the IL-1β-induced expression of iNOS and production of NO in renal mesangial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2148996212,"Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is the least understood enzyme of folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism in plants.

Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and other organisms. The MTHFR of E. coli (MetF) is a homotetramer of 33-kDa subunits that prefers NADH as reductant (1Sheppard C. Trimmer E. Matthews R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 718-7251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas mammalian MTHFRs are homodimers of 77-kDa subunits that prefer NADPH and are allosterically inhibited by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) (2Matthews R.G. Sheppard C. Goulding C. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1998; 157: S54-S59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Goyette P. Sumner J.S. Milos R. Duncan A.M.V. Rosenblatt D.S. Matthews R.G. Rozen R. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Two domains have been identified in mammalian MTHFR polypeptides. The NH2-terminal catalytic domain (about 40 kDa) shows 30% sequence identity to E. coli MetF and, like MetF, contains FAD as a noncovalently bound prosthetic group (2Matthews R.G. Sheppard C. Goulding C. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1998; 157: S54-S59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal domain contains the AdoMet binding site; [methyl-3H]AdoMet photoaffinity labeling located this site about 50 residues from the junction between the domains (2Matthews R.G. Sheppard C. Goulding C. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1998; 157: S54-S59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Goyette P. Sumner J.S. Milos R. Duncan A.M.V. Rosenblatt D.S. Matthews R.G. Rozen R. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Yeast and other eukaryotic MTHFRs have a two-domain structure similar to the mammalian enzyme (5Raymond R.K. Kastanos E.K. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 6Guenther B.D. Sheppard C.A. Tran P. Rozen R. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The MTHFR reaction in liver is physiologically irreversible, due to a combination of the large standard free energy change for the reduction of CH2-THF by NADPH (ΔG 0′ = -5.2 kcal mol−1) and the high NADPH/NADP ratio in the cytoplasm (7Vanoni M.A. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5272-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 8Wohlfarth G. Diekert G. Arch. Microbiol. 1991; 155: 378-381Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A corollary of this irreversibility is that MTHFR has the potential to deplete the pool of CH2-THF, reducing its availability for synthesis of thymidylate and purines (9Appling D.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 10Bagley P.J. Selhub J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13217-13220Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The AdoMet sensitivity of the liver enzyme functions to check such depletion, leaving CH2-THF available for other metabolic demands (9Appling D.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 10Bagley P.J. Selhub J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13217-13220Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Thus, mammalian MTHFR commits one-carbon units to methyl group synthesis and is considered to have a key regulatory role in one-carbon metabolism. In contrast to the detailed information about MTHFR from mammals andE. coli, there are few data on plant MTHFR and no genes have been identified (11Cossins E.A. Davies D.D. The Biochemistry of Plants. 11. Academic Press, New York1987: 317-352Google Scholar, 12Cossins E.A. Phytochemistry. 1997; 45: 437-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), making it the least understood enzyme of folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism in plants. MTHFR activity has been detected in crude extracts of pea tissues using a CH3-THF-menadione oxidoreductase (i.e. reverse direction) assay, and found to be insensitive to methionine (13Cossins E.A. Roos A.J. Chan P.Y. Sengupta U.K. Phytochemistry. 1972; 11: 2481-2488Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The reductant has not been identified. No plant MTHFRs have been purified, and the size and number of their subunits remain unknown. This dearth of information on plant MTHFRs and their regulatory properties has become critical with the start of work on plant metabolic engineering, because success in many current projects may depend upon understanding and modifying the mechanisms whereby plants balance the demands for methyl groups and other one-carbon moieties. Such projects include engineering the accumulation of betaines or methylated polyols, modifying lignins, and enhancing the synthesis of pharmaceutical alkaloids (14Nuccio M.L. Rhodes D. McNeil S.D. Hanson A.D. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1999; 2: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 15Boudet A.M. Lapierre C. Grima-Pettenati J.

In this study, we used genomics-based approaches to identify plant MTHFR cDNAs, and expressed them in yeast. The recombinant enzymes were partially characterized, providing a foundation for more detailed study of their catalytic and regulatory properties. We identified cDNAs from plants with the C3 and C4pathways of photosynthesis (Arabidopsis and maize, respectively) because C3 and C4 species differ in one-carbon metabolism, the former having a large photorespiratory carbon flux through glycine and serine (17Oliver D.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 45: 323-337Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, we developed a sensitive and specific NAD(P)H-CH2-THF oxidoreductase (i.e. forward direction) radioassay that can be used with crude extracts. The results indicate that, in contrast to the mammalian enzymes, the MTHFRs from Arabidopsis and maize use NADH as the reductant, and that AdoMet does not feedback-inhibit their activity. [14C]Formaldehyde (53 mCi mmol−1) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products, and (6R,6S)-[methyl-14C]CH3-THF (56 mCi mmol−1) from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; specific radioactivities were adjusted to the desired values with unlabeled compound. (6R,6S)-Tetrahydrofolic acid (THF) and (6R,6S)-CH3-THF were obtained from Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). The purity of THF was 86%, estimated by letting the NADH-CH2-THF oxidoreductase reaction go to completion. CH3-THF and14CH3-THF were dissolved in 8 mmsodium ascorbate and stored at −80 °C. THF was dissolved just before use in N2-gassed 0.25 mtriethanolamine-HCl, pH 7, containing 40 mm2-mercaptoethanol.

Arabidopsis plants (ecotype Columbia) were grown in potting soil in a culture room at 26 °C under 14-h days (PPFD = 80 μE m−2s−1). Maize (cv. Florida 32B) for radiotracer experiments and tobacco (cv. Wisconsin 38) were grown in soil in a greenhouse under natural lighting; the maximum temperature was 33 °C. Maize plants (cv. B73) for cDNA library construction were grown in sand in a culture room at 25 °C under 12-h days (PPFD = 300–400 μE m−2 s−1) and irrigated with 0.25× Hoagland's nutrients; roots were harvested at 14 days of age. Spinach (cv. Savoy Hybrid 612) was grown in similar conditions and salinized with 200 mm NaCl.

Plant Physiol. 1987; 84: 1271-1275Crossref Google Scholar), and used to construct a λUni-ZAP XR cDNA library according to the manufacturer's protocols (Stratagene). Two amino acid sequences conserved in eukaryote MTHFRs, FEFFPPKT and AVTWGVFP, were used to design the degenerate PCR primers 5′-CGARTTYTTYCCRCCVAARAC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GGAAAACWCCCCAMGTKACAGC-3′ (reverse primer), respectively. These were used to amplify a ≈1,500-base pair product by reverse transcription-PCR. The PCR product was cloned into the pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega); sequencing confirmed that it specified a polypeptide homologous to MTHFRs from other organisms. The 1,500-base pair fragment was then used to identify cDNAs from the maize root library.Arabidopsis expressed sequence tags (ESTs), GenBank accession numbers W43486 and W43508 (hereafter termed AtMTHFR-1 and -2, respectively), were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Columbus, OH). Both strands of cDNAs were sequenced using the ABI Prism dye terminator cycle sequencing Ready Reaction (PE Applied Biosystems) and an ABI model 373 sequencer. Sequence alignments were made using Clustal W 1.7 (20Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Homology searches were made using BLAST programs (21Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

Maize ESTs were sought in GenBank and the data base maintained by Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc (hereafter, Pioneer). Plant MTHFR coding sequences were amplified from plasmid templates by high fidelity PCR using recombinant Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and primers that included the first or last six codons plus BamHI andPstI site sequences for cloning into pVT103-U. This plasmid contains the URA3 gene for selection and the ADH1promoter to drive gene expression (18Vernet T. Digard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). For AtMTHFR-2, the forward primer was used to add 5′-ATGAAG-3′ to restore the missing first two codons (see text). The AtMTHFR-1 coding sequence was amplified in unmodified form, and also with a five-residue histidine tag added to the COOH terminus by inserting 5′-CATCACCATCACCAT-3′ before the stop codon. After ligation into pVT103-U, constructs were introduced intoE. coli strain DH10B by electroporation. MTHFR constructs were verified by sequencing, and used to transform yeast strain RRY3 as described (5Raymond R.K. Kastanos E.K. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All operations were at 0–10 °C. Yeast cultures were grown to an A 600 of 1–2, washed, and broken by agitation (5 or 10 × 0.5 min) with glass beads in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 or 7.2, containing 1 mm EDTA, 12–25 μm FAD, and 10% (v/v) glycerol (Buffer A) plus 1 mm PMSF (5Raymond R.K. Kastanos E.K. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Where specified, a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P8849) was used (at 3% v/v in the extraction buffer and 1% v/v in the desalting buffer) in place of PMSF. Plant tissues were pulverized in liquid N2 and extracted with 2 ml per g of buffer A containing 1 mm PMSF. Extracts were cleared by centrifugation (25,000 × g, 30 min), desalted on PD-10 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer A, and concentrated if necessary in Centricon-30 units (Amicon). Extracts were stored at −80 °C after freezing in liquid N2; this did not affect MTHFR activity. The histidine-tagged AtMTHFR-1 protein was purified by two cycles of affinity chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) superflow resin (Qiagen) as described (22Zhao W.-N. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21811-21817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Buffers contained 10 μm FAD; binding was carried out at 40 mm imidazole, washing at 60 mm, and elution at 400 mm for the first cycle and 300 mm for the second. Native molecular mass was estimated using a Waters 626 HPLC system equipped with a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); reference proteins were cytochrome c, carbonic anhydrase, bovine serum albumin, and β-amylase. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out as described (23James F. Nolte K.D. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22344-22350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Protein was estimated by Bradford's method (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Assays were made under conditions in which substrates were saturating, and product formation was proportional to enzyme concentration and time. When imidazole and NaCl were present in enzyme preparations, their final concentrations in the assays were kept ≤45 mm to avoid inhibitory effects. CH3-THF-menadione oxidoreductase activity was measured by a modification of published methods (25Kutzbach C. Stokstad E.L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 250: 459-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 26Matthews R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 122: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Assays (final volume 100 μl, in 1.5-ml screw-cap microcentrifuge tubes) contained 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 (shown to be the optimal pH), 2 mm EDTA, 180 nmol of sodium ascorbate, 200 nmol of formaldehyde, 2.5 nmol of FAD, 51 nmol (50 nCi) of [methyl-14C]CH3-THF, enzyme extract, and 25 nmol of menadione. Reactions were started by adding a 1 mm menadione solution (in water at 65 °C unless otherwise indicated) to the other components at 0 °C, incubated at 30 °C for 10 or 20 min, and stopped with 50–65 μl of dimedone reagent (26Matthews R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 122: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) plus 100 nmol of formaldehyde. After heating at 100 °C for 5 min, 1 ml of toluene was added and the tubes were agitated for 2 min and centrifuged (16,000 × g, 2 min). A sample (0.8 ml) of the toluene phase was mixed with 3 ml of scintillation fluid (Beckman Ready Gel) and counted. For assay blanks, enzyme was omitted during incubation and added just before the dimedone reagent. The reaction product was analyzed by TLC on Silica Gel 60 in methanol:acetone:HCl (90:10:4, v/v/v). Product recovery was determined to be 60 ± 3% (mean ± S.E., n = 14) by spiking unlabeled reaction mixtures with [14C]formaldehyde, and experimental data were corrected accordingly. NAD(P)H-CH2-THF oxidoreductase activity was measured in reaction mixtures (final volume 20 μl, in 2-ml screw-cap microcentrifuge tubes) containing 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 0.3 mm EDTA, 4 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 42 nmol (0.1 μCi) of [14C]formaldehyde, 20 nmol of THF, 0.5 nmol of FAD, 4 nmol of NAD(P)H, 20 nmol of glucose 6-phosphate, 0.06 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (1 unit = 1 μmol of NAD reduced min−1 at pH 7.2, 24 °C), and enzyme preparation. Blank assays contained no NAD(P)H. The buffer, EDTA, [14C]formaldehyde, THF, and 2-mercaptoethanol were mixed and held for 5 min at 24 °C in hypoxic conditions (to allow14CH2-THF to form) before adding other components. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min, and stopped by adding 1 ml of 100 mm formaldehyde. After standing for 20 min at 24 °C (to allow 14C to exchange out of CH2-THF), 0.2 ml of a slurry of AG-50(H+) resin (1:1 with water) was added to bind14CH3-THF. The resin was washed with 3 × 1.5 ml of 100 mm formaldehyde, mixed with 1 ml of scintillation fluid, and counted. The counting efficiency was 40%, determined using assays spiked with 14CH3-THF. The identity of the reaction product was verified by reverse-phase HPLC (27Gregory J.F. Manley D.B. Day B.P.F. J. Nutr. 1984; 114: 341-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). NADP phosphatase activity was measured by incubating extracts with 10 mm NADP in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, at 30 °C for 30 min, followed by enzymatic assay of NAD using yeast alcohol dehydrogenase. Arabidopsisrosettes (240 ± 30 mg) or sets of three maize leaf discs (11 mm diameter, 70 ± 3 mg/3 discs, cut from a young blade and scarified with eight radial cuts on the abaxial surface) were allowed to absorb 0.5 μCi (9 nmol) of [methyl-14C]CH3-THF dissolved in 20 μl of 8 mm sodium ascorbate, minus or plus 25 mml-serine. Label was fed to rosettes via the severed root, and to discs via the cuts; after uptake, the feeding solution was replaced by water or 25 mm serine. Incubation was in the light (PPFD = 150 μE m−2s−1) at 28 °C for 3.5 h. Tissues were extracted with 80% acetone, and the extract was separated into amino acid, organic acid/phosphate ester, and sugar fractions using AG-50(H+) and AG-1 (formate) columns (28Atkins C.A. Canvin D.T. Can. J. Bot. 1971; 49: 1225-1234Crossref Google Scholar). Starch in the insoluble residue was hydrolyzed in 1 m HCl (4 h, 100 °C), and the [14C]glucose formed was purified by ion exchange as above. Amino acids were separated on cellulose TLC plates in n-butanol:acetic acid:water (6:2:2, v/v/v) and by electrophoresis in 0.6 m HCOOH, 1.5 mCH3COOH at 1.8 kV, 4 °C, for 20 min; detection was with ninhydrin. Serine and glycine zones were scraped from electrophoresis plates for 14C assay. Sugars were separated by TLC on cellulose plates in n-propanol:ethyl acetate:water (7:1:2, v/v/v) and detected with alkaline KMnO4. Samples spiked with [methyl-14C]CH3-THF were included as controls. Arabidopsis genomic DNA was isolated from leaves as described (29Lassner M.W. Peterson P. Yoder J.I. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1989; 7: 116-128Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar). One-μg samples of the isolated DNA were digested, separated in 0.7% agarose gels, and transferred to supported nitrocellulose membrane (NitroPure, MSI) as described by Sambrook et al. (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The blots were hybridized overnight at 58 °C in 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μg ml−1 sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and washed at low stringency (1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 37 °C) (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The probe was the full-length AtMTHFR-1 cDNA. Maize genomic DNA was prepared from 3-day-old seedlings as described (31Gustinich S. Manfioletti G. Del Sal G. Schneider C. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 298-302PubMed Google Scholar); 6.5-μg samples were digested, separated in 0.8% agarose gels, and transferred to Duralon-UV membrane (Stratagene). Hybridization was at 42 °C in 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 50% formamide, and 100 μg ml−1 salmon sperm DNA. Washing was at low stringency (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 25 °C). The probe was the full-length ZmMTHFR-1 cDNA. Probes were labeled with 32P by the random primer method. Radioactive bands were detected by autoradiography. For Arabidopsis, the strategy was based on a sequence from chromosome II whose conceptual translation product (unknown protein, GenBank accession no. AAC23420) is homologous to eukaryotic MTHFRs. BLAST searches using the deduced cDNA corresponding to AAC23420 detected 15 Arabidopsis ESTs of two types, one essentially identical to the AAC23420 nucleotide sequence, the other differing by ≈15%. Sequencing a nearly full-length representative of each type (both from hypocotyl libraries) confirmed that they encode polypeptides that are 86% identical to each other and ≈43% identical to human and yeast MTHFRs (Fig. 1). The deduced proteins are designated AtMTHFR-1 (592 residues, 66.3 kDa) and AtMTHFR-2 (594 residues, 66.8 kDa). AtMTHFR-2 is identical to the AAC23420 conceptual translation product except that the latter has a 12-residue insert (Fig. 1,triangle) attributable to an error made by the gene-prediction algorithm. For maize, a homology-based PCR strategy was adopted. Two amino acid sequences conserved in eukaryotic MTHFRs were used to design degenerate PCR primers, which amplified a ≈1500-base pair fragment from a root cDNA template. Screening a root library with this fragment yielded 10 apparently full-length cDNAs with the same sequence. They encode a 593-residue (66.4 kDa) protein (ZmMTHFR-1) that is 77% identical to AtMTHFR-1 (Fig. 1). Twelve maize MTHFR ESTs were found in GenBank and Pioneer data bases, all encoding ZmMTHFR-1. Fig. 1 shows that the deduced plant proteins are homologous to human and yeast MTHFRs throughout their entire length, and appear to lack targeting sequences (e.g. chloroplast or mitochondrial transit peptides). In the NH2-terminal catalytic domain, of the 19 residues shown to interact with the FAD cofactor in the E. coli enzyme (Fig. 1, asterisks), 17 are identical or conservatively replaced in the plant sequences. The three plant MTHFR cDNAs were subcloned into the expression vector pVT103-U and introduced into yeast strain RRY3, a met12 met13 double disruptant that totally lacks MTHFR activity and is a methionine auxotroph (5Raymond R.K. Kastanos E.K. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All three constructs yielded methionine-independent transformants at high frequency; growth of the transformants on plates was comparable to that of the wild-type strain DAY4 (Fig. 2 A). No complementation was observed with the vector alone (Fig. 2 A), and retransformation of RRY3 with rescued plasmid containing the AtMTHFR-1 cDNA restored methionine prototrophy, showing that the complementation is due to the encoded plant protein. CH3-THF-menadione oxidoreductase activity was readily detected in desalted extracts of the complemented strains but not, as expected, in RRY3 (Fig. 2, panels B and C). To authenticate the observed activity, reactions were allowed to proceed to near completion, and the labeled product was verified by TLC (Fig. 2 C). Addition of a five-residue histidine tag to the carboxyl terminus of the AtMTHFR-1 polypeptide had no impact on complementation (results not shown) and little effect on enzyme activity (Fig. 2 B). The specific activities of yeast extracts containing plant MTHFRs (Fig. 2 B) are at least 150-fold greater than those of wild type yeast (5Raymond R.K. Kastanos E.K. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and up to 50-fold greater than those of liver (25Kutzbach C. Stokstad E.L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 250: 459-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 26Matthews R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 122: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), indicating that recombinant MTHFR proteins are expressed at a high level in yeast. The histidine-tagged AtMTHFR-1 enzyme was purified 640-fold by two cycles of affinity chromatography on nickel-NTA resin (Table I). The specific activity of the purified enzyme assayed just after isolation (6.9 μmol min−1 mg−1 protein at 30 °C) falls between the values reported for human MTHFR and E. coli MetF (1Sheppard C. Trimmer E. Matthews R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 718-7251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,26Matthews R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 122: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme was found to be unstable, losing about half its activity during 3 h on ice. To investigate the mass and integrity of MTHFR subunits, the purified protein was analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3). A 64-kDa band was evident, consistent with the size of the deduced polypeptide, and no bands of lower molecular mass. This demonstrates that the plant MTHFR protein isolated from yeast is not cleaved at the junction between the domains, a site that is particularly protease-sensitive in mammalian MTHFR and at which cleavage results in loss of AdoMet inhibition (2Matthews R.G. Sheppard C. Goulding C. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1998; 157: S54-S59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Goyette P. Sumner J.S. Milos R. Duncan A.M.V. Rosenblatt D.S. Matthews R.G. Rozen R. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In the purification experiment documented in Table I and Fig. 3, a mixture of protease inhibitors (see “Experimental Procedures”) was added to the buffers. Because very similar results were obtained when PMSF (1 mm) alone was added (results not shown), for all other work we used PMSF. The molecular mass of the native AtMTHFR-1 enzyme was estimated by size exclusion chromatography (results not shown). The protein migrated as a symmetrical peak with an apparent molecular mass of 141 kDa, which is consistent with a dimer of 66-kDa subunits.Table IAffinity purification of the histidine-tagged form of AtMTHFR-1StepProteinActivitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgmilliunitsmilliunits mg −1%-foldDesalted extract21.423010.81001Cycle 1 eluate0.04289.7214039200Cycle 2 eluate0.004430.4692013643"

All of the chimeric transporters were expressed at levels equal to or greater than those of wild type SERT, but the transport and binding activity of the mutants varied greatly. In particular, mutants in which the NET sequence replaced external loops 4 or 6 of SERT had transport activity 5% or less than that of wild type, and the loop 5 replacement was essentially inactive. In some of these mutants, binding of a high affinity cocaine analog was less affected than transport, suggesting that the mutation had less effect on the initial binding steps in transport than on subsequent conformational changes. The more severely affected mutants also displayed an altered response to Na+. In contrast to the dramatic reduction in transport and binding, the specificity of ligand binding was essentially unchanged. Chimeric transporters did not gain affinity for dopamine, a NET substrate, or desipramine, an inhibitor, at the expense of affinity for serotonin or paroxetine, a selective SERT inhibitor. The results suggest that external loops are not the primary determinants of substrate and inhibitor binding sites. However, they are not merely passive structures connecting transmembrane segments but rather active elements responsible for maintaining the stability and conformational flexibility of the transporter.

It is a member of a large family of carriers that couple the uphill movement of neurotransmitters and other metabolites with the downhill flux of Na+ and Cl− (5Rudnick G. Reith M. Neurotransmitter Transporters: Structure, Function, and Regulation. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 73-100Crossref Google Scholar). The strong homology within this family suggests that the mechanism of transport is similar and that structural elements conserved within the family perform similar functions in each transporter. A prominent feature in each of the primary sequences is the presence of 12 regions rich in hydrophobic amino acids, linked by hydrophilic regions of variable length (6Blakely R. Berson H. Fremeau R. Caron M. Peek M. Prince H. Bradely C. Nature. 1991; 354: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 7Hoffman B.J. Mezey E. Brownstein M.J. Science. 1991; 254: 579-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic regions were originally modeled as membrane-spanning domains linked by alternating external and internal loops (6Blakely R. Berson H. Fremeau R. Caron M. Peek M. Prince H. Bradely C. Nature. 1991; 354: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 7Hoffman B.J. Mezey E. Brownstein M.J. Science. 1991; 254: 579-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). One of these loops, which links putative transmembrane domains 3 and 4 (TM3 and TM4), is much larger than the rest and contains consensus sites forN-linked glycosylation (8Tate C. Blakely R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and an intramolecular disulfide (9Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) in all family members. The original topological model for these NaCl-coupled transporters was challenged in studies using mutants of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine transporters (GAT-1 and GLYT-1) (10Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 11Olivares L. Aragon C. Gimenez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1211-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that the predicted first external loop (EL1) was not exposed on the cell exterior and that the first internal loop (IL1) was actually extracellular. One drawback of these studies was that the conclusions about EL1 and IL1 topology were drawn from the properties of inactive mutants. Subsequent studies with active mutants of SERT supported the original topology in which EL1 was external and IL1 was internal (12Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12675-12681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The mechanism usually considered to account for carrier-mediated transport depends on alternating access of bound substrate to the external and internal sides of the membrane (13Mitchell P. Res. Microbiol. 1990; 141: 286-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). According to this model, the substrate must be bound in a way that allows it to be exposed to either the external medium or the cytoplasm. It has been proposed that transmembrane domains form the binding site and that conformational changes of the protein alternately expose this site to the two sides of the membrane. Evidence from cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of SERT TM3 supports the proposal that the binding site is formed by transmembrane domains. Two cysteine replacement mutants in TM3, I172C, and Y176C behave as if the inserted cysteine is located in close proximity to bound serotonin (14Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The function of external loop regions has not been established. In the GABA transporter subfamily, residues in EL5 were shown to participate in the ability of the transporter to discriminate between GABA and β-alanine as substrates (15Tamura S. Nelson H. Tamura A. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28712-28715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Residues in this loop were also implicated in the uncoupled ion flux mediated by SERT (16Cao Y. Li M. Mager S. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7739-7749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In EL2 of SERT, however, no change in substrate or inhibitor sensitivity was observed when a large portion was replaced with the corresponding sequence from the closely related norepinephrine transporter (NET), although the chimeric transporter was severely defective in transport activity (17Stephan M.M. Chen M.A. Penado K.M.Y. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This study suggested that at least some external loop regions were involved in conformational changes required for transport and did not participate in substrate and inhibitor binding. In the present study, we have extended this approach by performing loop-scanning mutagenesis on the extracellular domain of SERT. Each predicted external loop was converted to the corresponding sequence in NET, which is the transporter closest to SERT in sequence. The chimeric mutants were tested for transport and binding activity, surface expression, and sensitivity to specific SERT and NET inhibitors. The results suggest that residues responsible for the selectivity of SERT and NET inhibitors are not located in external loops. However, many of the mutations exhibited markedly decreased intrinsic transport activity, suggesting that they participated in the conformational changes required for turnover. Transfected HeLa cells (one 75-cm2 flask) expressing SERT or SERT-NET chimeras were incubated overnight, washed once with 5 ml of binding buffer (BB, 300 mm NaCl containing 10 mm HEPES buffer adjusted with LiOH to pH 8.0) at 25 °C and then scraped off the flask into 1 ml of ice-cold BB with protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml each leupeptin and pepstatin A and 100 μm α-toluenesulfonyl fluoride) and transferred to a 12 × 75-mm polystyrene tube. The flask was rinsed with an additional 2 ml of ice-cold BB with protease inhibitors and combined with the first suspension. Clumps of cells were broken up by pipetting the suspension up and down. The suspension was then sonicated on ice using a Virtis Virsonic 50 at a power level of 50–60% for 20–30 s. Sonication was repeated once after the suspension had cooled. The membranes were collected by centrifugation at 44,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C and resuspended thoroughly in 0.5 ml of BB plus protease inhibitors. This membrane preparation was used fresh or stored at −80 °C until use. The SERT mutant Q111K (SNEL1′) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (12Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12675-12681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Using this mutant, Ile-108 was then replaced with leucine using primer A (see below) to yield SNEL1. NET DNA was amplified with primers B and C (see below), which contained restriction sites for RsrII andPpuMI, respectively, and the product was digested with these enzymes. The digested fragment was then ligated into epitope-tagged wild type SERT (prSTag) that had the corresponding fragment removed by treatment with RsrII and PpuMI. Using site-directed mutagenesis, BsmI andPpuMI sites were introduced into NET at the positions corresponding to those same unique sites in SERT using the primers C and D, which include the KYSKYK sequence of NET. TheBsmI-PpuMI fragment was cut out and used to replace the corresponding fragment in prSTag. NET DNA was amplified using polymerase chain reaction with primers E and C, which contained restriction sites forBsmI and PpuMI, respectively. The resulting product was digested with these two enzymes and ligated into prSTag that had the corresponding fragment removed by treatment withBsmI and PpuMI. prSTag was cut with AlwNI, the 1877-base pair fragment was further digested with BglII, and theAlwNI-BglII fragment was retained along with the 3055-base pair AlwNI fragment. A BglII site was introduced into pNET by site-directed mutagenesis using the primer F, and a 60-base pair pNET fragment was created by digestion withBspMI and BglII. This NET fragment and the two SERT fragments were ligated with a BbsI-BspMI linker (sense, G; antisense, H) to generate SNEL3′. The SERT sequence WRV, near the border of EL3 with TM5, remained in this chimera. SNEL3′ was further mutated by site-directed mutagenesis with primer I to convert the WR sequence to the NET sequence SN to yield the construct SNEL3′′, and the Val was then replaced with an isoleucine residue by mutagenesis with primer J to yield the full SERT-NET EL3 chimera, SNEL3. Restriction sites for AvrII andBsu36I were introduced into the borders of EL4 in both SERT (primers K and L) and NET (primers M and O) by site-directed mutagenesis, and the AvrII-Bsu36I fragment from NET was used to replace the corresponding region of SERT. Since the SNEL4 chimera was shorter than SERT by 1 residue in EL4, an alanine residue was introduced into SNEL4 between Glu-400 and Gly-401 by site-directed mutagenesis using primer P. These chimeric transporters were created by site-directed mutagenesis using mutagenic primers Q and R, respectively, containing the entire NET loop sequence flanked by SERT sequences.

For the modifications using QuickChange, each of the primers was used together with an antisense primer. In all cases, the mutated regions were subcloned into the original plasmid using flanking restriction sites and sequenced to ensure that no unwanted modifications were introduced. Cell surface expression of the transporters was determined using the membrane-impermeable biotinylation reagent, NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) by a modification of the procedure of Gottardi et al. (18Gottardi C. Dunbar L. Caplan M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 37: F285-F295Crossref Google Scholar) as described previously (9Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were labeled with NHS-SS-biotin, the excess reagent was quenched, and the cells were solubilized. Cell surface proteins were isolated from the cell extract with immobilized streptavidin, and transporter was detected in the pool of surface proteins by gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Immunoblots were quantitated using an Alpha Innotech IS-1000. Nonlinear regression fits of experimental and calculated data were performed with Origin (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA), which uses the Marquardt-Levenberg nonlinear least squares curve-fitting algorithm. The statistical analysis was done with data from single experiments. All the experiments were repeated a total of 2–4 times and in all cases gave essentially the same results. Unless otherwise indicated, data with error bars represent the mean ± S.D. for duplicate samples. The expression system used has been described in detail elsewhere (17Stephan M.M. Chen M.A. Penado K.M.Y. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Briefly, the plasmid prSTag and all the mutants used here contain a promoter for T7 RNA polymerase upstream from the rat brain SERT cDNA. This promoter was used to express wild type and mutant SERTs in the vaccinia/T7 polymerase/HeLa cell system. HeLa cells were plated in 48-well plates at 50% confluency and allowed to grow overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Inc.; Calabasas, CA), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Life Technologies, Inc.). The next day they were infected with a vaccinia virus strain, VTF-7 (19Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), which makes T7 RNA polymerase (added to the cells in 40 μl/well of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium without serum). After a 15-min incubation with the virus at 37 °C, the cells were transiently transfected with wild type and mutant plasmids (400 ng of plasmid DNA and 1.2 μl of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) per well in 80 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium without serum). Wild type SERT, no plasmid (mock-transfected) controls, and mutants were each transfected in duplicate wells. [3H]Serotonin transport assays were carried out the next day between 19 and 24 h post-infection. The cells were washed with 250 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4, and 1.4 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.3) containing 0.1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBSCM). Transport was measured by incubating the cells with 14.6 nm n-[1,2-3H]serotonin (NEN Life Science Products; NET-498) in 80 μl of PBSCM for 15 min at room temperature, an interval previously determined to include only the initial, linear phase of transport. For determination of V max, a range of 5-HT concentrations was generated by the addition of unlabeled 5-HT. Each well was washed very quickly three times with 320 μl of ice-cold PBS. The cells were lysed in 100 μl of 1% SDS, transferred to scintillation vials, and counted in 3-ml of Optifluor (Packard Instrument Co.). The transport activity of each mutant was tested at least three different times, in duplicate wells each time, and the results were averaged. Binding of the high affinity cocaine analog, 2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-[125I]iodophenyl)tropane (β-CIT), was measured in isolated membranes. The membrane suspension was thawed on ice, and a sample of 10 μl was diluted into 50 μl of binding buffer (300 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 8.0 with LiOH) containing 0.07 nmβ-[125I]CIT unless indicated otherwise. For measurements of Na+-dependent β-CIT binding, the NaCl concentration was varied, and LiCl was added to maintain constant osmolarity. Binding was allowed to approach equilibrium by incubation for 1 h at room temperature. The samples then were diluted rapidly with 1 ml of binding buffer and filtered through a #32 glass fiber filter (Schleicher & Schuell) previously soaked in 0.3% polythyleneimine. The filters were washed twice with 1 ml of binding buffer, placed in the scintillation vials containing 3 ml of Optifluor (Packard), and counted after 3 h. To evaluate the involvement of external loop domains on the function of SERT, we generated a series of chimeric transporters in which residues in external loops were replaced with the corresponding residues from the norepinephrine transporter (NET). Fig. 1 shows the external loop regions and the residues (black circles) that are identical in SERT and NET. We had previously replaced a portion of the second external loop (EL2) with corresponding NET sequence (17Stephan M.M. Chen M.A. Penado K.M.Y. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the current work, we replaced the remainder of EL2 with NET sequence. NET EL2 is longer than SERT EL2 by six residues. We, therefore, also generated a chimera in which six residues of NET sequence were removed. Although the sequence similarity between SERT and NET is low in EL2, there is a notable lysine-rich sequence, KYSKYK, present in NET and not in SERT. The NET sequence in chimera SNEL2b begins just before (and includes) that lysine-rich sequence, and SNEL2b′ begins just after the KYSKYK and therefore has the same EL2 length as SERT (Fig. 1). Another EL2 chimera containing 29 residues of NET sequence replacing residues 194 through 222 of SERT (SNEL2a) (17Stephan M.M. Chen M.A. Penado K.M.Y. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) was adjusted by removing the sequence PKLLNG from the NET region. One other chimera was also adjusted so that the total loop length was the same as that of SERT. SNEL4′ contains one SERT residue (Ala-401) added back to the NET sequence to keep the loop length equal to that in SERT. Table I shows a list of chimeras and their locations within the primary sequence.Table ISERT-NET chimeric transportersChimeraNET sequenceRemarksSNEL1108–115Only Ile-108 and Gln-111SNEL1′Q111KSNEL2194–253Entire loopSNEL2b223–253Includes KYSKYKSNEL2b′223–247KYSKYK removedSNEL3303–331SNEL3′310–331SNEL3″303–308, 310–331SNEL4384–411SNEL4′384–412Ala-401 addedSNEL5488–494SNEL6561–574 Open table in a new tab Transport activity of the various chimeras transiently expressed in HeLa cells varied from close to that of wild type SERT to completely inactive. The sensitivity of transport activity varied with the position of the NET sequence replacement. Replacement of EL4, EL5, or EL6 led to complete loss of transport activity, but replacements in some other regions had a much smaller effect on transport (Table II). Significant amounts of activity were retained in chimeras where most or all of EL1, EL2, or EL3 was replaced with NET sequence. The location of the substitution was apparently more important than the divergence in sequence. For example, the replacements in EL3 and EL4 were similar in the number of residues replaced but very different in activity. In some cases, we were able to identify specific residues that led to activity loss. For example Ile-108 in EL1 and Try-306–Arg-307 in EL3 accounted for most of the activity loss in SNEL1 and SNEL3 (Table II).Table IITransport and binding activity of SERT-NET chimerasChimeraTransport activityBinding activityWild type100 ± 5100 ± 27SNEL144 ± 866 ± 13SNEL1′80 ± 10SNEL24 ± 239 ± 12SNEL2b6 ± 2.5SNEL2b′30 ± 4.4SNEL338 ± 1050 ± 12SNEL3′69 ± 17SNEL3″42 ± 5SNEL46 ± 32 ± 1SNEL4′1.1 ± 1SNEL51.25 ± 111 ± 6SNEL65.8 ± 483 ± 19 Open table in a new tab The length of the loop replacement also was not the critical factor determining the activity. In EL2 and EL4, the NET loop size differs from SERT. However, in both cases, size was not the only factor leading to activity loss. Although EL2 in SNEL2b′ lacked the KYSKYK sequence and was the same size as in SERT, that chimera had only about 30% wild type activity. This was significantly more than chimera SNEL2b, which contained the KYSKYK sequence, although removal of the NET sequence PKLLNG from SNEL2a (17Stephan M.M. Chen M.A. Penado K.M.Y. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) to make EL2 identical in length to SERT had no effect on activity (data not shown). Likewise, the inactivity of chimera SNEL4 does not result from the fact that EL4 is shorter in that mutant by one residue, since adding back the missing residue in SNEL4′ failed to restore activity. Finally, SNEL5 and SNEL6 lacked transport activity even though the loop length was unchanged. To test for the possibility that inactive mutants were misfolded, we prepared membranes from cells expressing the mutants and tested their ability to bind the high affinity cocaine analog β-CIT. Chimeric transporters with functional binding sites should bind β-CIT even if the protein is retained in intracellular pools or is prevented from catalyzing rapid transport. The results in Table II indicate that some of the chimeras, even those with very low transport activity, retained the ability to bind β-CIT with high affinity. In particular, chimera SNEL6, like SNEL2a (17Stephan M.M. Chen M.A. Penado K.M.Y. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), retained wild type binding activity, although it was not functional for transport. In SNEL4 and SNEL5, binding was so weak as to prevent accurate measurements of ligand affinity, but binding in the other chimeras was closer to wild type levels than was transport (Table II). Of all the loop replacements, the short sequence of seven residues in EL5 had the most dramatic effect on transporter function when replaced by the corresponding NET sequence, which differs only in three residues. To assess surface expression of the mutants, we treated cells expressing each chimeric transporter with NHS-SS-biotin, an impermeant reagent that reacts with exposed lysine residues and is known to label SERT from the cell exterior (12Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12675-12681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The labeled cells were solubilized, and biotinylated proteins were isolated using immobilized streptavidin as described (12Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12675-12681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 17Stephan M.M. Chen M.A. Penado K.M.Y. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The abundance of SERT in the biotinylated cell surface fraction was determined by Western blotting, as shown in Fig. 2. The results clearly indicate that each of these chimeric transporters is delivered to the cell surface at least as efficiently as wild type SERT. The defects observed in transport by these mutants, therefore, are due to an intrinsic inability to catalyze efficient 5-HT translocation, rather than an inability of the protein to reach the plasma membrane. To determine whether the loss of transport or binding activity was due to altered ion coupling, we examined the Na+ ion dependence of these activities in chimeras SNEL1, SNEL2, SNEL3, and SNEL6. The Na+ K m for transport in SNEL1 and SNEL3 was moderately increased relative to the wild type prSTag from 17 ± 3 mm to 70 ± 19 and 58 ± 14 mm, respectively (Fig. 3 A). In SNEL2 and SNEL6, we determined the Na+ dependence of β-CIT binding, since these mutants were unable to transport. Fig. 3 B shows that in wild type SERT, as described previously (20Humphreys C.J. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9118-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), β-CIT binding does not absolutely require Na+. In SNEL2, however, no binding was observed when Li+ replaced Na+, and the effect of Na+ was not maximal even at 300 mm. Chimera SNEL6 was intermediate between these two. Both chimeras demonstrated a greater dependence on Na+(or inhibition by Li+) than the wild type and required higher [Na+] for saturation, as estimated by fitting the binding data. To determine if the substrate and inhibitor selectivity of the transporter is determined by external loops, we tested the ability of two substrates, 5-HT and dopamine, and two inhibitors, paroxetine and desipramine, to bind to the chimeric transporters. Dopamine is a good substrate for NET and a poor substrate for SERT, and 5-HT is similarly selective for SERT. Fig. 4 shows that dopamine was not an effective inhibitor of β-CIT binding in SERT or any of the chimeric constructs. 5-HT, however, displaced β-CIT from each chimera at approximately the same concentration that was effective in wild type SERT (Fig. 4). Paroxetine is one of the most selective inhibitors of SERT, having little affinity for NET, whereas desipramine binds tightly to NET and less well to SERT. Fig. 5 shows results in which the potency of desipramine and paroxetine for β-CIT displacement was tested. Table III lists theK I values of 5-HT, dopamine, paroxetine, and desipramine for inhibition of β-CIT binding to the SERT-NET chimeras. In addition, we have calculated an index of relative SERT versus NET affinity from the inhibitor dissociation constants. None of the chimeric mutants showed a major decrease in paroxetine affinity and a corresponding increase in desipramine affinity as would be expected if any external loop significantly contributed to the inhibitor binding site (Fig. 4). The SERT/NET affinity index did not dramatically decrease for any of the chimeras (Table III). Thus, it appears as if residues in the external loops of SERT do not contribute significantly to the selectivity of substrate and inhibitor binding.FIG. 5Displacement of β-CIT from SERT-NET chimeras by paroxetine and desipramine.

Berson H. Fremeau R. Caron M. Peek M. Prince H. Bradely C. Nature. 1991; 354: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 7Hoffman B.J. Mezey E. Brownstein M.J. Science. 1991; 254: 579-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Recent studies with impermeant reagents have demonstrated that residues in each of the predicted external loops are exposed to the cell exterior, largely validating the initial structural model (12Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12675-12681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). According to the alternating access model for transport (13Mitchell P. Res. Microbiol. 1990; 141: 286-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the substrate binding site is likely to be made from the side chains of residues in transmembrane domains and not internal or external loops. The function of these loops, then, might be completely passive, serving only to connect transmembrane segments. However, the loops also might serve to coordinate the conformational changes required for transport or even participate in forming the substrate binding site. Previous attempts to understand neurotransmitter transporters using chimeras have had mixed results. Sufficient differences exist between NET and SERT so that chimeras containing transmembrane domains from both proteins were inactive (21Moore K.R. Blakely R. Biotechniques. 1994; 17: 130-136PubMed Google Scholar), although substitution of either the NH2- or COOH-terminal hydrophilic domain was tolerated well (22Blakely R. Moore K. Qian Y. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1993; 48: 283-300PubMed Google Scholar). The higher extent of sequence identity between NET and the dopamine transporter allowed the formation of functional chimeras between these two proteins (23Buck K. Amara S. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1993; 19: 40.12Google Scholar, 24Giros B. Wang Y. Suter S. McLeskey S. Pifl C. Caron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15985-15988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Buck K. Amara S.

Although these studies suggested that certain regions of the sequence were responsible for substrate and inhibitor binding, it was not possible to distinguish between transmembrane and loop regions. In the GABA transporter subfamily, residues in EL5 were shown to contribute to substrate specificity (15Tamura S. Nelson H. Tamura A. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28712-28715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and residues in EL5 were also implicated in the uncoupled ion flux carried by SERT (16Cao Y. Li M. Mager S. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7739-7749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in EL2 of SERT, partial substitution with NET sequence did not affect substrate or inhibitor sensitivity (17Stephan M.M. Chen M.A. Penado K.M.Y. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The present work extends the NET substitution study and represents the first attempt to scan the entire extracellular face of a neurotransmitter transporter. The results of this approach allow several conclusions about the role of extracellular loops in SERT function. 1) These loops are not merely passive elements connecting transmembrane domains. 2) The loops do not represent a major determinant of binding selectivity for substrates and inhibitors. 3) Certain external loops, especially EL4 and EL5, are extremely sensitive to modification, as if they are critical for proper assembly or stability of SERT. Although it is possible to generalize about some of the consequences of replacing SERT external loops with NET sequence, such as the retention of selectivity for SERT inhibitors and substrates, it is more difficult to make general conclusions about the role of these loops in transport. It is likely that many of these loops participate in conformational changes that occur during transport. Some of the loop replacements lead to dramatically lower transport activity but only moderately reduced binding, and this is not due to lower levels of cell surface expression. Such behavior would be expected if the initial steps in transport, namely binding, were less perturbed than subsequent steps involving conformational changes. At least part of the decreased activity observed with the chimeric mutants may be related to their ionic requirements. In particular, replacing Na+ with Li+ caused a loss of binding activity in SNEL2 and SNEL6 that was not observed in the wild type transporter. Perturbation of the transporter structure may lead to increased Na+ dependence or increased Li+sensitivity. In addition to the results with SNEL2 and SNEL6, the Na+ K m for transport was increased in SNEL1 and SNEL3. It is unlikely that any one of these loops serve as a specific Na+ binding site since chimeras from loops far apart in the primary sequence all have similar effects on the ionic dependence. Replacement of Na+ with Li+ also increases the reactivity of Cys-109 in EL1. This may represent a structural deformation that is tolerated better in the wild type transporter than in these loop chimeras. Alternatively, if some loop chimeras, such as SNEL2 and SNEL6, are limited in their ability to undergo conformational changes, then the exposure of Cys-109 in Li+ might also be limited. Future experiments will address this possibility. By default, if the substrate binding site is not formed by external loops, then transmembrane domains are most likely to contribute to the binding pocket. In previous work (14Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that two residues in TM3, Ile-172 and Tyr-176, are close to the binding site for 5-HT and cocaine. In cysteine replacement mutants, these positions, although predicted to be deep in the membrane interior, were sites of inactivation by the hydrophilic external reagent MTSET ([2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate). Moreover, the transporter was protected from inactivation by 5-HT and cocaine, and after modification by MTSET the transporter was unable to bind β-CIT (14Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These are characteristics expected for residues in a binding pocket. Taken together with the current work, these experiments suggest that the complimentary functions of binding and conformational changes in the transport cycle are subserved by the transmembrane and loop domains, respectively, of SERT. In the present work, we found that substitution of SERT loops EL4, EL5, or EL6 with NET sequence led to a dramatic loss in activity. Of these, perhaps the most interesting is EL5, where only three residues differ. Tamura et al. (15Tamura S. Nelson H. Tamura A. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28712-28715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) showed that, in the GABA transporter family, conversion of EL5 residues from GAT-1 to GAT-3 sequence led to the ability to bind β-alanine as an inhibitor. They postulated that EL4, EL5, and EL6 formed a binding site for GABA and other substrates in the GABA transporter family. Previous work by Cao et al.(16Cao Y. Li M. Mager S. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7739-7749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on SERT EL5 residues indicated that the uncoupled ion flux carried by SERT was influenced by this loop and proposed that EL5 contributed to an external gate. The results of Tamura et al. (15Tamura S. Nelson H. Tamura A. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28712-28715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with GAT-1 and GAT-3 agree with the present results and those of Caoet al. (16Cao Y. Li M. Mager S. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7739-7749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with SERT, in that they all point to an important role for EL5. The mutations in GAT-1 EL5 led to a change in substrate selectivity (15Tamura S. Nelson H. Tamura A. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28712-28715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), whereas changes in SERT EL5 resulted in a change in uncoupled flux (16Cao Y. Li M. Mager S. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7739-7749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or loss of activity with no detectable change in selectivity (this work). A more detailed investigation of this interesting region of the transporter seems warranted. It should be emphasized that the NET sequences used in these loop chimeras were fully functional in the background of NET. If these sequences behaved as interchangeable parts, they would be expected to function also in SERT. The fact that so many of the chimeras were defective in transport activity indicates that the loop sequences function by interaction with other parts of the protein. NET loop sequences apparently did not fit properly in the SERT background, leading to a defect in transport function. We tested the possibility that these required interactions occur within a single loop by combining the SNEL2a chimera (17Stephan M.M. Chen M.A. Penado K.M.Y. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with the SNEL2b chimera to generate a chimera (SNEL2) in which the entire EL2 consisted of NET sequence. Rather than increasing activity, SNEL2 activity was lower than that of either SNEL2a or SNEL2b alone (Table II). We conclude that interactions between the loops or between loops and transmembrane domains are important for the proper function of SERT.

https://openalex.org/W2135775829,"The structural determinants of aldosterone binding specificity in the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) have not been determined. The MR has greatest sequence identity with the better characterized glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which is reflected in their overlapping ligand binding specificities. There must be subtle sequence differences that can account for the MR-specific binding of aldosterone and the shared binding of cortisol. To characterize ligand binding specificity, chimeras were made between the human MR and GR ligand-binding domains (LBDs). Three points were chosen as break points to generate a total of 16 different constructs. These chimeric LBDs were placed in a human GR expression vector containing the GR DNA-binding and N-terminal domains and assayed by co-transfection into CV-1 cells with the mouse mammary tumor virus-luciferase reporter plasmid. Binding of [3H]aldosterone and [3H]dexamethasone was also measured. All of the constructs that are potently activated by aldosterone contain amino acids 804–874 of the MR. The results of the ligand binding experiments using [3H]aldosterone were consistent with the transactivation assay. Cortisol activation of the chimeras was surprisingly complex. Constructs that are activated by cortisol contain either amino acids 804–874 and 932–984 of the MR or amino acids 598–668 and 726–777 of the GR. However, all of the chimeras retained the ability to bind the synthetic glucocorticoid [3H]dexamethasone, and cortisol was able to displace [3H]dexamethasone binding, suggesting that the differential effects of cortisol on transcriptional activation are caused by an effect that occurs downstream of ligand binding. These results identify a subregion of the MR LBD that confers specificity of aldosterone binding, which contrasts with cortisol binding where differential effects between chimeras appear to be mediated by interactions distal to ligand binding. The structural determinants of aldosterone binding specificity in the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) have not been determined. The MR has greatest sequence identity with the better characterized glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which is reflected in their overlapping ligand binding specificities. There must be subtle sequence differences that can account for the MR-specific binding of aldosterone and the shared binding of cortisol. To characterize ligand binding specificity, chimeras were made between the human MR and GR ligand-binding domains (LBDs). Three points were chosen as break points to generate a total of 16 different constructs. These chimeric LBDs were placed in a human GR expression vector containing the GR DNA-binding and N-terminal domains and assayed by co-transfection into CV-1 cells with the mouse mammary tumor virus-luciferase reporter plasmid. Binding of [3H]aldosterone and [3H]dexamethasone was also measured. All of the constructs that are potently activated by aldosterone contain amino acids 804–874 of the MR. The results of the ligand binding experiments using [3H]aldosterone were consistent with the transactivation assay. Cortisol activation of the chimeras was surprisingly complex. Constructs that are activated by cortisol contain either amino acids 804–874 and 932–984 of the MR or amino acids 598–668 and 726–777 of the GR. However, all of the chimeras retained the ability to bind the synthetic glucocorticoid [3H]dexamethasone, and cortisol was able to displace [3H]dexamethasone binding, suggesting that the differential effects of cortisol on transcriptional activation are caused by an effect that occurs downstream of ligand binding. These results identify a subregion of the MR LBD that confers specificity of aldosterone binding, which contrasts with cortisol binding where differential effects between chimeras appear to be mediated by interactions distal to ligand binding. mineralocorticoid receptor steroid hormone receptor(s) ligand-binding domain(s) heat-shock protein(s) glucocorticoid receptor polymerase chain reaction(s) mouse mammary tumor virus luciferase Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium progesterone receptor The steroid hormone aldosterone is important for the control of blood pressure through the promotion of sodium reabsorption in the kidney and colon (1Fuller P.J. Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 1997; 4: 218-224Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Aldosterone has other roles besides sodium balance; it has direct central effects on blood pressure (2Gomez-Sanchez E.P. Zhou M. Gomez-Sanchez C.E. Steroids. 1996; 61: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis (3Young M.J. Funder J.W. Steroids. 1996; 61: 233-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The importance of aldosterone in blood pressure control and hypertension is underlined by the fact that the three known monogenetic causes of hypertension, glucocorticoid remediable hyperaldosteronism (4Jamieson A. Connell J.M.C. Fraser R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 10: 3-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), apparent mineralocorticoid excess (5White P.C. Mune T. Agarwal A.K. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 135-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), and Liddle's syndrome (pseudoaldosteronism) (6Chang S.S. Grunder S. Hanukoglu A. Rösler A. Mathews P.M. Hanukoglu I. Schild L. Lu Y. Shimkets R.A. Nelson-Williams C. Rossier B.C. Lifton R.P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), all involve this steroid, its receptor, or sodium reabsorption. Despite the importance of aldosterone there is only limited knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that underlie its action.Aldosterone binds to, and acts through, the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR).1 This protein belongs to the steroid hormone receptor (SHR) family of ligand-dependent transcription factors. As with other members of the family the receptor structure can be divided into three major domains (7Arriza J.L. Weinberger C. Cerelli G. Glaser T.M. Handelin B.L. Housman D.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). The first of these is the N-terminal domain, which contains an “activation function” involved in transcriptional activation (8Rupprecht R. Arriza J.L. Spengler D. Reul J.M.H.M. Evans R.M. Holsboer F. Damm K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 9Govindan M.V. Warriar N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24439-24447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the middle of the protein is the DNA-binding domain, which binds to specific DNA sequences on target genes. C-terminal to the DNA-binding domain is the ligand-binding domain (LBD), which has sequences involved in ligand binding (10Fagart J. Wurtz J.-M. Souque A. Hellal-Levy C. Moras D. Rafestin-Oblin M.-E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3317-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), transcriptional activation (8Rupprecht R. Arriza J.L. Spengler D. Reul J.M.H.M. Evans R.M. Holsboer F. Damm K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and heat-shock protein (HSP) binding (11Eisen L.P. Harmon J.M. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 1419-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 12Nemoto T. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Sato N. Ota M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 769-775PubMed Google Scholar). The mineralocorticoid receptor is the least characterized of the SHRs.The critical function of the LBD is the binding of ligand. In the absence of ligand the MR exists predominantly in the cytoplasm in a complex with a number of HSPs (12Nemoto T. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Sato N. Ota M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 769-775PubMed Google Scholar). The role of HSP binding is two-fold: to keep the receptor in an inactive state and to maintain the LBD in a structural conformation that promotes high affinity ligand binding (12Nemoto T. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Sato N. Ota M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 769-775PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of ligand alters the conformation of the receptor and displaces the HSPs, which exposes sequences involved in receptor dimerization, nuclear localization, and DNA binding. Thus ligand binding activates the receptor.Of the steroid hormone receptors, the MR has the most sequence identity with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (7Arriza J.L. Weinberger C. Cerelli G. Glaser T.M. Handelin B.L. Housman D.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). This is reflected in the overlapping binding specificities of the two receptors. Both receptors bind cortisol and corticosterone with high affinity (13Funder J.W. Pearce P.T. Smith R. Smith A.I. Science. 1988; 242: 583-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar), whereas only the MR binds aldosterone with high affinity. In vivo binding specificity is maintained by a number of mechanisms, the most of important of which involves the type 2 isoform of the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase that converts cortisol/corticosterone to inactivate 11-keto metabolites in MR-containing cells (5White P.C. Mune T. Agarwal A.K. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 135-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The synthetic GR agonist dexamethasone also binds to the MR (7Arriza J.L. Weinberger C. Cerelli G. Glaser T.M. Handelin B.L. Housman D.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar), albeit with a lower affinity. This is reflected in functional data showing dexamethasone to be a less potent activator of the MR than of the GR (14Arriza J.L. Bonvalet J.P. Farman N. Lombès M. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Aldosterone: Fundamental Aspects. Colloque INSERM/John Libbey Eurotext Ltd., Paris1991: 13-21Google Scholar). It is likely that there are sequences shared between the two receptors that allow both to bind cortisol with high affinity and sequences that differ between the two receptors that permit specific binding of aldosterone to the MR. However, the amino acids involved in aldosterone binding specificity remain to be determined. In this report we have used chimeras between the LBDs of the MR and GR as a way of determining sequences important in the specific binding of aldosterone to the MR. Our laboratory has previously used this strategy to investigate cortisol resistance in the guinea pig GR (15Keightley M.-C. Fuller P.J. Steroids. 1995; 60: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Keightley M.-C. Curtis A.J. Chu S. Fuller P.J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2479-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar strategy has also been used previously to determine sequences important to ligand specificity to the androgen receptor (17Vivat V. Gofflo D. Wurtz J.-M. Bourguet W. Philibert D. Gronemeyer H. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 18: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and to identify determinants of RU486 binding in the progesterone receptor (18Benhamou B. Garcia T. Lerouge T. Vergezac A. Gofflo D. Bigogne C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Science. 1992; 255: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). By examining these chimeras using a transactivation assay and by direct ligand binding we have identified a region in the LBD that is responsible for the specificity of aldosterone binding to the MR.DISCUSSIONThe nature and determinants of ligand binding to the MR are only partially understood. The characterization of ligand binding in other nuclear hormone receptors has been assisted by the study of steroid insensitivity syndromes where natural amino acid mutations/substitutions alter binding. To date, however, only nonsense and splice-site mutations have been found in the MR in the autosomal dominant form of aldosterone resistance (pseudohypoaldosteronism) (26Geller D.S. Rodriguez-Soriano J. Boado A.V. Schifter S. Bayer M. Chang S.S. Lifton R.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Conclusions about the nature of ligand binding to the MR have therefore been drawn largely from analogies with other receptors in the SHR family. In this study we have used a different approach to determining sequences important for the specificity of aldosterone binding to the MR, by taking advantage of the high degree of amino acid sequence identity between the MR and GR (7Arriza J.L. Weinberger C. Cerelli G. Glaser T.M. Handelin B.L. Housman D.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar) to create chimeras between the LBDs of the two receptors. The binding of both aldosterone and cortisol, the two natural ligands for the MR in humans, was then examined. The chimeras were analyzed by a sensitive functional assay using luciferase expression driven by the MMTV promoter, and the results of this assay were then compared with the results of direct ligand binding experiments. Importantly for the interpretation of the results, all of the constructs bound [3H]dexamethasone, confirming that all were expressed and able to bind ligand.Aldosterone BindingThere was a good correlation between the results of the functional assay and the direct ligand binding experiments, which attests to the validity of the chimeric approach to the investigation of the determinants of aldosterone binding specificity. Aldosterone only activates chimeras in which the second section contains MR sequence, corresponding to amino acids 804–874 of the MR LBD. Inserting this region into the GR (the GMGG chimera) leads to an approximate 2-order of magnitude increase in affinity for aldosterone compared with wild-type GR. This region of the MR LBD must therefore be critical for aldosterone binding specificity. It was also observed that aldosterone activates the MR LBD, GMMM, and MMGM more potently than MMGG, GMGG, and MMMG, suggesting that the second region alone is not sufficient for high affinity binding of aldosterone and that although they are not critical, sequences in the fourth region of the MR LBD (between amino acids 932–984) also contribute. This is consistent with analysis of the crystal structures of the estrogen receptor-α (27Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engström L. Öhman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.-Å. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar, 28Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar) and progesterone receptor (PR) (29Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) LBDs. In these structures the regions corresponding to the second and fourth regions of the chimeras form the ligand-binding pocket. The same approach of using LBD chimeras has been used to examine the binding specificities of the androgen receptor and PR (17Vivat V. Gofflo D. Wurtz J.-M. Bourguet W. Philibert D. Gronemeyer H. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 18: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Inserting the region between amino acids 766–799 of the androgen receptor into the PR leads to a dramatic increase in the affinity of the chimera for testosterone. Interestingly this region overlaps the MR (804–874) region that we find determines aldosterone binding specificity.Two of the chimeras, GMGM and GMMG, behaved anomalously. Given the results of the other chimeras it would be predicted that the GMGM chimera should bind aldosterone with high affinity, yet in both the functional and ligand binding assays this construct has a decreased affinity for the ligand as compared with the MR LBD. The GMMG chimera is not activated by aldosterone in the functional assay by concentrations up to 300 nm despite containing the MR sequence in the second region. It does however bind [3H]aldosterone at a concentration of 2 nm. The GMMG chimera therefore appears to be able to bind aldosterone but is unable to then activate transcription. It is possible that in these two chimeras the secondary and tertiary structures of the proteins have been perturbed enough to affect ligand binding and receptor function. The design of the chimeras was begun before publication of a consensus structure of the nuclear hormone receptor LBD (30Wurtz J.M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) based on the crystal structures of the retinoid acid receptor γ and retinoid X receptor α LBDs. As a result the design of the chimeras does not take into account the putative α-helical nature of the LBD structure. The dissociation between ligand binding and transcriptional activity observed with the GMMG chimera may, for example, be caused by structural perturbations leading to a failure of nuclear localization of the ligand-bound receptor. The importance of nuclear localization is demonstrated in a study showing that certain PR antagonists are poor GR antagonists, despite having a high affinity for the GR, because of an inability of these compounds to promote nuclear localization of the receptor (31Wagner B.L. Pollio G. Giangrande P. Webster J.C. Breslin M. Mais D.E. Cook C.E. Vedeckis W.V. Cidlowski J.A. McDonnell D.P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The region between amino acids 804–874 in the MR (second region in the chimeras) corresponds to α-helices 5–8 of the PR LBD crystal structure (29Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) (labeled helices 6–9 in the estrogen receptor-α LBD structure (27Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engström L. Öhman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.-Å. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar)). There is 48% amino acid identity between this region of the MR and the corresponding region of the GR, which is lower than the overall 57% sequence identity between the two proteins in their LBDs. Fig. 5 shows the position of the region of the MR between amino acids 804–874 based on the crystal structure of the PR LBD. Given the position of the ligand in the PR LBD crystal structure (29Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) it is likely that the amino acid or amino acids that govern aldosterone binding specificity lie in helix 5, the β-turn, and/or helix 7. Previous studies on the structures of the LBDs of the MR and other SHRs provide very few clues as to the identity of these critical residues. In the crystal structure of the PR holo-LBD (29Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) interactions were observed between two residues (Gln725 and Arg766) and the 3-keto group of progesterone. However, this region of the steroid molecule is identical in aldosterone, cortisol, corticosterone, and progesterone, and the two residues identified are conserved in the MR, GR, and PR, so it is very unlikely that they are involved in conferring the specificity of aldosterone binding. In the estrogen receptor-α holo-LBD crystal structure (27Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engström L. Öhman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.-Å. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar) a residue (His524) was identified that interacts with the 17-hydroxyl moiety of estradiol. The structures of aldosterone and cortisol do differ at C17, but the analogous residue in the MR lies outside the 804–874 region. The secondary and tertiary structures of the MR LBD, bound to aldosterone, have been modeled based on the retinoid acid receptor γ crystal structure (10Fagart J. Wurtz J.-M. Souque A. Hellal-Levy C. Moras D. Rafestin-Oblin M.-E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3317-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The amino acids Gln776 and Arg817 were found to interact with the 3-keto group of aldosterone, and Asn770 and Thr945 were found to interact with the 20-keto/21-hydroxyl groups of the ligand. Site-directed mutagenesis of these residues confirmed their importance in ligand binding and validated the model. All four residues are conserved between the MR and GR, consistent with the structures of aldosterone, cortisol, and corticosterone being identical at the C3, C20, and C21 positions, so again it is highly unlikely that these residues are involved in MR ligand binding specificity. In another study it was observed that mutation of either Cys849 or Cys942 of the MR LBD dramatically decreases or abolishes ligand binding (32Lupo B. Mesnier D. Auzou G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12153-12159Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cys849 lies within the region of 804–874, but both of these residues are conserved in the GR and are therefore again unlikely to be involved in MR ligand specificity. Consistent with this, mutation of these two residues produced identical effects on cortisol and aldosterone binding (32Lupo B. Mesnier D. Auzou G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12153-12159Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).The inability of studies described above to identify or provide clues to amino acids involved in aldosterone binding specificity may reflect a limitation of the techniques of crystallography and molecular modeling, both of which determine the final binding conformation of the ligand-receptor complex. The differences between the aldosterone and cortisol/corticosterone molecules lie at the C11 and C18 positions. Therefore, it is highly likely that interactions between these regions of the steroid and the receptor determine binding specificity. However, in the MR LBD model no amino acids were identified as interacting with the C11 and C18 positions of aldosterone (10Fagart J. Wurtz J.-M. Souque A. Hellal-Levy C. Moras D. Rafestin-Oblin M.-E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3317-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Ligand binding to SHRs is a dynamic process, as evidenced by the dramatic changes in conformation involving the helix 12 region of the LBD (33Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar, 34Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar), and binding specificity may be governed by the initial interactions between ligand and receptor that occur before the resulting conformational changes (29Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Based on those results, it may therefore not be possible to determine which amino acids are critical for aldosterone binding specificity from crystal structures or molecular models. The use of receptor chimeras has proven to be very useful in gaining insights into ligand binding to other SHRs (15Keightley M.-C. Fuller P.J. Steroids. 1995; 60: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Keightley M.-C. Curtis A.J. Chu S. Fuller P.J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2479-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Vivat V.

Bigogne C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Science. 1992; 255: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and complements these other techniques.Cortisol Binding and TransactivationWe had assumed that, as cortisol binds with high affinity to both the MR and GR, this steroid would activate all of the chimeras. Surprisingly, however, only the GR, MR, GMMM, MMGM, MGGG, GGMG, and MGMG constructs were activated by cortisol. One common feature of these constructs is that the second and fourth sections are derived from the same receptor; they contain either amino acids 804–874 and 932–984 of the MR or amino acids 598–668 and 726–777 of the GR. The only exception is the GMGM chimera, which also shows anomalous aldosterone binding behavior. It was subsequently found that cortisol can displace [3H]dexamethasone binding from the other chimeras, thereby demonstrating that all of the chimeras retain the ability to bind this ligand. This suggests that the differential effects of cortisol in the functional assay are because of an effect downstream of ligand binding. There is a complex cascade of events involved in MR and GR function after ligand binding: heat-shock protein dissociation, nuclear localization, dimerization, DNA binding, and transcriptional activation. Presently we do not know which of these aspects of receptor function is being affected. Both the MR and GR LBDs harbor a ligand-dependent AF-2 region involved in transcriptional activation (8Rupprecht R. Arriza J.L. Spengler D. Reul J.M.H.M. Evans R.M. Holsboer F. Damm K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and one possibility is that this region is responsible for the dissociation between ligand binding and transactivation observed with cortisol. However, in the system used in these experiments the AF-1 region in the N-terminal domain of the GR, which is common to all of the constructs, is predominantly responsible for the transcriptional effect (8Rupprecht R. Arriza J.L. Spengler D. Reul J.M.H.M. Evans R.M. Holsboer F. Damm K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), so it is highly unlikely that dysfunction of the AF-2 region can account for the results. It is also unlikely that ligand binding affects the AF-1 region itself, which functions independent of ligand binding (8Rupprecht R. Arriza J.L. Spengler D. Reul J.M.H.M. Evans R.M. Holsboer F. Damm K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).The absolute requirement of the second and fourth regions of the MR for activation by cortisol is not a characteristic shared by aldosterone. The study of other nuclear hormone receptors has shown a relationship between the nature of ligand binding, the resulting conformational changes in the receptor structure, and the downstream effect this has on receptor function. It is therefore possible that the two ligands bind to the MR differently and may therefore have different effects on transcription. There is some evidence for such differences. One consistent finding in many cells lines is that, although both aldosterone and cortisol bind with the same affinity to the receptor, aldosterone activates the receptor at lower concentrations than are required by cortisol (22Arriza J.L. Simerly R.B. Swanson L.W. Evans R.M. Neuron. 1988; 1: 887-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 23Cato A.C.B. Mink S. Hartig E. Bonvalet J.P. Farman N. Lombès M.

Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 834-840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This implies a functional difference in the binding of the two steroids. It has also been shown that intracerebroventricularly administered aldosterone increases blood pressure in the unilaterally nephrectomized rat, and this effect is not mimicked by corticosterone. In fact, corticosterone antagonizes the action of aldosterone (35Gomez-Sanchez E.P. Venkatamaran M.T. Thwaites D. Fort C. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: E649-E653PubMed Google Scholar).SummaryWe have identified a region of the MR LBD, between amino acids 804–874, that is crucial for aldosterone binding specificity. Our approach of using receptor chimeras complements both crystallography and molecular modeling to assist in our understanding of ligand binding to the MR. We believe that the initial interactions between ligand and receptor, before the resulting conformation changes in the protein structure, determine binding specificity. The techniques of crystallography and molecular modeling can only identify amino acid residues interacting with the ligand in its final “resting position” after the conformational changes have occurred. The results described in this study are the first step in a process that should allow us to identify individual amino acids that are crucial for aldosterone binding specificity. Results from this analysis of aldosterone binding to the MR may prove very useful in the design of new classes of MR antagonists for use in treating conditions in which high levels of aldosterone contribute to the pathogenesis. The steroid hormone aldosterone is important for the control of blood pressure through the promotion of sodium reabsorption in the kidney and colon (1Fuller P.J. Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 1997; 4: 218-224Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Aldosterone has other roles besides sodium balance; it has direct central effects on blood pressure (2Gomez-Sanchez E.P. Zhou M. Gomez-Sanchez C.E. Steroids. 1996; 61: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis (3Young M.J. Funder J.W. Steroids. 1996; 61: 233-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The importance of aldosterone in blood pressure control and hypertension is underlined by the fact that the three known monogenetic causes of hypertension, glucocorticoid remediable hyperaldosteronism (4Jamieson A. Connell J.M.C. Fraser R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 10: 3-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), apparent mineralocorticoid excess (5White P.C. Mune T. Agarwal A.K. Endocr.

(1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 27873–27878). The manipulations of b subunit length have been extended by construction of insertion mutations into the uncF(b) gene adding amino acids to the second stalk. Mutants with insertions of seven amino acids were essentially identical to wild type strains, and mutants with insertions of up to 14 amino acids retained biologically significant levels of activity. Membranes prepared from these strains had readily detectable levels of F1F0-ATPase activity and proton pumping activity. However, the larger insertions resulted in decreasing levels of activity, and immunoblot analysis indicated that these reductions in activity correlated with reduced levels of b subunit in the membranes. Addition of 18 amino acids was sufficient to result in the loss of F1F0 ATP synthase function. Assuming the predicted α-helical structure for this area of the bsubunit, the 14-amino acid insertion would result in the addition of enough material to lengthen the b subunit by as much as 20 Å. The results of both insertion and deletion experiments support a model in which the second stalk is a flexible feature of the enzyme rather than a rigid rod-like structure.

Most of the mass of the enzyme is organized into two sectors, referred to as F1 and F0, which are linked by two thin stalk structures (4Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A channel composed of the aand c subunits in the F0 sector conducts protons across the membrane down the electrochemical gradient (5Fillingame R.H. Jones P.C. Jiang W. Valiyaveetil F.I. Dmitriev O.Y.

Energy derived from proton translocation results in the propagation of a conformational change through the stalks driving ATP synthesis at distant catalytic sites in the F1 sector. A series of elegant experiments have clearly established that this conformational change takes the form of a rotation of the central stalk (6Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L.

The central stalk consists of the F1 γ and ε subunits, which appear to be in direct contact with a ring of 12 csubunits in the F0 sector (11Zhang Y. Oldenburg M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol.

During catalysis, rotation of the c 12γε subunits sequentially alters the properties of the three catalytic sites located at subunit interfaces in the F1 α3β3hexamer. Differing interactions between the γ subunit and each of the three β subunits accounts for the asymmetry observed in the high resolution structure of bovine F1 and the differing conformations and nucleotide binding affinities of the catalytic sites (16Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2719) Google Scholar). The apparent function of the peripheral second stalk is to serve as a stator holding the α3β3 hexamer in place against the rotation of the central stalk. Thus, the emerging view is that the second stalk is the primary structural feature maintaining the integrity of the stator elements in F1F0 ATP synthase. A b 2 dimer forms the second stalk making contact with the δ subunit and at least one αβ subunit pair (17Rodgers A.J.W. Wilkens S. Aggeler R. Morris M.B. Howitt S.M. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16652-16656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), it appears that theb 2 subunits contribute all of the material visualized in the second stalk. From the electron micrographs and composite images of the Escherichia coli enzyme produced by Capaldi and colleagues (23Capaldi R.A. Aggeler R. Turina P. Wilkens S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 284-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), it is clear that the second stalk spans a distance of 40–45 Å from the surface of the membrane to the bottom of F1. The stalk appeared to be bent at an angle of about 20° in micrographs of single complexes (4Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Recently, the structure of peptides modeling the single transmembrane domain of theb subunit dissolved in organic solvents have been determined using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (24Dmitriev O. Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15598-15604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The evidence suggests that Trp-26 may be at the hydrocarbon-polar interface on the cytoplasmic leaflet of the bilayer, so the region of the b subunit that constitutes the second stalk visible in the electron micrographs starts in the vicinity of Ala-32 and extends to at least Gln-85 and probably a few amino acids beyond. This segment of the b subunit is predicted to be in an α helical conformation, and substantial experimental evidence supports this secondary structure (25Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Previously, we performed a deletion analysis in the second stalk segment of the b subunit to determine the minimum length of the second stalk necessary to form a productive F1F0 ATP synthase (28Sorgen P.L. Caviston T.L. Perry R.C. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27873-27878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, theb subunits could be shortened by as much as 11 amino acids or approximately 16 Å with the retention of function. Losses of activity resulting from the deletions were largely attributable to defective assembly of the enzyme complex. Once assembled, the F1F0 ATP synthases with the shortenedb subunits were functional. These observations suggested that the b 2 subunit dimer has an inherent flexibility and that the deletions removed slack present in the second stalk of the wild type enzyme. This interpretation appeared to be incompatible with models in which the second stalk was a rigid structural feature of F1F0 ATP synthase. In the present work, we have further tested the flexibility hypothesis by inserting additional amino acids into the second stalk regions of the b subunits. The prediction was that if theb 2 dimer was indeed a flexible unit, then insertions of substantial length could be accommodated in functional F1F0 ATP synthase complexes. The additional material would not produce a devastating distortion in the enzyme as might be expected with a rigid structural unit. Insertion mutations were constructed in the uncF(b) gene duplicating segments of the b subunit sequence. Because the goal of these experiments was to determine the maximum extension of the bsubunit second stalk region allowing F1F0 ATP synthase function, the most important issue was retention of detectable enzymatic activity. We show that insertion mutants in which the second stalk region of the b subunits has been lengthened substantially and retained biologically and biochemically measurable levels of activity. The E. coli uncF(b) deletion strain KM2 (29McCormick K.A. Cain B.D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7240-7248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the wild type b subunit expression plasmid pKAM14 have been described previously (30McCormick K.A. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24683-24691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pSD59 (b sol) was the generous gift of Dr. Stanley Dunn (University of Western Ontario) (25Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Growth of strains on a nonfermentable carbon source was scored using Minimal A medium containing succinate (0.2% w/v). Cells for membrane preparation were grown in LB supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) glucose at 37 °C. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside (IPTG)1 (40 μg/ml), ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml) were included as needed. Culture medium components were purchased from Difco, and antibiotics were obtained from Sigma. Molecular biology enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and New England BioLabs, and the oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified by Gemini Biotech. Restriction endonuclease reactions, ligation reactions, and transformations were performed according to the recommendations of the manufacturers. Plasmid DNA was purified with the Qiagen Mini and Maxi-Prep kits from Qiagen, and DNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified using the Qiagen QIAquick kit. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed either by cassette mutagenesis (31Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3292-3300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by using a Stratagene QuikChange kit. Nucleotide sequences were determined by automated sequencing in the core facility of the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research. Plasmid pKAM14 (b) was used to construct the insertion mutations in the stalk region of the b subunit. All of the insertion plasmids were constructed by ligation of synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides into the PpuMI and PvuII sites in plasmid pKAM14 (b) (see Fig. 1). Except for the insertions, the final products of all constructions were identical to the positive control plasmid pKAM14 (b) placing the recombinant uncF(b) genes under control of thelac promoter. Presence of the inserted sequences were initially detected by digestion of recombinant plasmid DNA with eitherStuI or HindIII, and then the nucleotide sequences were directly confirmed. For clarity, the numbers of amino acids inserted are indicated behind the plasmid name in parentheses throughout the paper, such as plasmid pAUL19 (+7). Plasmids encoding the b subunit insertions and control plasmids pKAM14 (b) and pBR322 were transformed into E. colistrain KM2 (Δb) for study. Each strain was also transformed with the plasmid pKAM16 (lacI q) (29McCormick K.A. Cain B.D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7240-7248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to provide improved regulation of expression of the uncF(b)genes. Selected mutations were transferred to plasmid pSD59 (b sol) for expression of modelb sol polypeptides. Plasmid pAUL49 (b sol+7) was constructed by replacing the 541-base pair PpuMI/BstEII fragment of pSD59 (b sol) with the comparable segment of pAUL19 (+7) containing the insertion. Two base substitutions were generated by using the Stratagene QuikChange kit on plasmid pSD59 (b sol) at uncF gene nucleotides 96 and 99; this resulted in silent mutations in the codons forb sol Ala-32,Ile33 while generating the uniqueMunI site in plasmid pAUL45 (b sol). The new MunI site and the existing BstEII site were then used to facilitate transfer of the uncF(b) gene deletion in pAUL 3 (Δ7) (28Sorgen P.L. Caviston T.L. Perry R.C. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27873-27878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) to pAUL45 (b sol) generating plasmid pAUL50 (b solΔ7). In each case, the nucleotide sequence of each recombinant plasmid was verified, and the expression of b sol polypeptides was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using the bsubunit-specific antiserum. Inverted membrane vesicles were prepared from 500-ml cultures of strain KM2 (Δb) carrying the recombinant uncF(b) gene expression plasmids according to methods described previously (25Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles stripped of F1 were prepared essentially as described previously (32Hartzog P.E. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32313-32317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).E. coli strain 1100 was transformed withb sol expression plasmids pAUL49 and pAUL50 and inoculated into 500 mL of LB supplemented with glucose medium. Preparation of b sol polypeptides was performed as detailed earlier (27Sorgen P.L. Bubb M.R. McCormick K.A. Edison A.S. Cain B.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by a modified Lowry procedure (33Markwell M.A.K. Hass S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5279) Google Scholar). Membrane energization was detected by the fluorescence quenching of 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (ACMA) (34Aris J.P. Klionsky D.J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11207-11215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and ATP hydrolysis activity of membrane fractions was assayed by the acid molybdate method (35Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10043-10050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were assayed in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 9.1) for determinations of linearity with respect to both time and enzyme concentration. Immunoblot analyses using the anti-bsubunit antibodies were as described previously (28Sorgen P.L. Caviston T.L. Perry R.C. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27873-27878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The anti-rabbit immunoglobulin horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody (from donkey), electrochemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents, and Hyperfilm were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Anti-b subunit antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Karlheinz Altendorf (Universität Osnabrück) (36Deckers-Hebestreit G. Simoni R.D. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12364-12369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chemical cross-linking of b sol peptides with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate and analytic ultracentrifugation experiments were conducted according to procedures published in earlier work (27Sorgen P.L. Bubb M.R. McCormick K.A. Edison A.S. Cain B.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To determine the maximum length of a b subunit that can be incorporated into a functional F1F0 ATP synthase, a collection of insertion mutations were generated within the stalk region of the b subunit by site-directed mutagenesis. The three options available for design of the insertion sequences were strings of alanines likely to generate α-helical segments, sequences of amino acids known to form α-helices in other proteins, and duplication of a segment of the b subunit. We elected to take the last approach because it seemed to hold the most promise in terms of establishing appropriate interactions between the twob subunits necessary for dimerization (Fig. 1). The duplicated segments started atb Leu-56 and extended in the direction of the carboxyl terminus because this area of the b subunit had proven to be the least sensitive to the effects of deletions (28Sorgen P.L. Caviston T.L. Perry R.C. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27873-27878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The lengths of the insertion mutations were designed to model, as closely as practicable, full turns of an α-helix. The earlier deletion experiments suggested that helix orientation effects resulting from less than complete turns reduced assembly of the enzyme complex (28Sorgen P.L. Caviston T.L. Perry R.C. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27873-27878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In all, four insertion plasmids were constructed ranging from addition of 7–18 amino acids modeling insertions of from 2–5 α-helical turns (Fig. 1). The effects of the insertion mutations were studied by complementation of uncF(b) gene deletion strain KM2 (Δb).E. coli strains defective for F1F0ATP synthase cannot derive energy from nonfermentable carbon sources, so growth on succinate minimal medium served as a convenient qualitative measure of enzyme function in vivo. Because high levels of expression of altered b subunits can in some instances overcome the effects from assembly defects (30McCormick K.A. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24683-24691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), experiments were conducted under conditions of both high and low level expression of the mutated uncF(b) genes under control of thelac promoter. In experiments using low expression conditions, strain KM2/pAUL47 (+11) harbored the largest bsubunit insertion capable of supporting visible colony formation on solid succinate-based medium (Table I). In the presence of saturating concentrations of IPTG, slow growth of strain KM2/pAUL48 (+14) was observed indicating biologically significant levels of F1F0 ATP synthase activity (Table I). Strain KM2/pAUL52 (+18) failed all growth tests, indicating that the insertion exceeded the maximum length allowable for the enzyme.Table IAerobic growth properties of mutants expressing uncF(b) gene insertions and membrane-associated ATP hydrolysis activityStrains and b subunit insertionsAmino acids addedGrowthaE. coli strains were grown aerobically on succinate minimal medium with antibiotics.

Open table in a new tab Membrane vesicles were prepared, and immunoblots were performed using an anti-b antibody to detect production and incorporation of the b insertion subunits into the membrane. Although a small reduction in the level of b subunit was observed from the low induction conditions cells, membranes from strain KM2/pAUL19 (+7) grown in the presence of IPTG possessed levels ofb subunit proteins approaching that of the wild type control membranes (Fig. 2). However, reductions in levels of b subunits were readily apparent in membranes from cells with longer insertions. As might be expected for a mutation resulting in a total assembly defect, no b subunit protein was found in the KM2/pAUL52 (+18) membrane preparations. F1 has little affinity for the membrane in the absence of F0, and in particular the b subunit hydrophilic domain (37Hermolin J. Gallant J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14550-14555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Perlin D.S. Cox D.N. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1985; 260: 8182-8187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so total membrane-associated F1-ATPase activity was used as a test of F1F0 ATP synthase complex assembly. The amounts of total F1F0-ATPase activity observed in the membranes fell with increasingly longer insertions (Table I). The KM2/pAUL19 (+7) membranes had the highest level of F1F0 ATPase activity of the insertion strains, and no significant activity was present in membranes prepared from strain KM2/pAUL52 (+18). Importantly, the membranes from strain KM2/pAUL48 (+14) grown under high expression conditions retained substantial amounts of enzymatic activity, indicating the presence of intact F1F0-ATPase complexes. Membranes were assayed for F1F0 ATP synthase-mediated ATP-driven proton pumping activity as an indication of coupled activity for theb subunit insertion enzymes. Acidification of inverted membrane vesicles was followed by monitoring the fluorescence of ACMA (Fig. 3). To demonstrate that the vesicles were intact and closed, the level of NADH-driven fluorescence quenching was assayed for all membrane preparations. In every case, the levels of NADH-driven fluorescence quenching were strong and comparable with both wild type and negative control membranes (data not shown). The levels of coupled activity in the membranes correlated very well with the ability of the strains to grow on succinate medium and the amount of intact F1F0 ATP synthase present. A modest reduction in ATP-driven proton pumping activity below wild type controls was observed in the KM2/pAUL19 (+7) membranes from cells grown under conditions of low expression (Fig. 3 A). A sharper reduction in activity was seen for the KM2/pAUL47 (+11) membranes, and no activity was detected in membranes from the longer insertion mutants. As anticipated from the slow growth of strain KM2/pAUL48 (+14) on succinate minimal medium, membranes prepared from this strain under high expression growth conditions possessed readily detectable levels of proton pumping activity (Fig. 3 B). ATP-driven proton pumping was enhanced in vesicles derived from IPTG-induced KM2/pAUL47 (+11) relative to membranes from uninduced cells, and KM2/pAUL19 (+7) membranes appeared to be essentially indistinguishable from wild type control KM2/pKAM14 membranes with respect to coupled activity. In general, the reductions in activity observed in membranes from the insertion strains reflected the reduced amounts of assembled F1F0 ATP synthase. Most importantly, the data established that intact F1F0 ATP synthase complexes containing the b subunits lengthened by as many as 14 amino acids possessed coupled activity. To consider the functional state of the proton translocation mechanism in the insertion mutant b subunit F0 sectors, passive proton permeability was studied in membranes stripped of F1 (Fig. 4). F0-mediated dissipation of an imposed proton gradient was monitored using ACMA fluorescence. Stripped membranes prepared from strain KM2/pAUL19 (+7) were virtually identical to the positive control membranes from KM2/pKAM14. Other insertion strain membranes had reduced rates of proton leakage commensurate with a reduced number of F0 sectors. Like the uncF(b) deletion mutants studied previously (28Sorgen P.L. Caviston T.L. Perry R.C. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27873-27878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), insertions in the second stalk region of theb subunit did not appear to have any direct affect F0-mediated proton conductance. The properties of model b sol polypeptides with either a deletion or an insertion of 7 amino acids were characterized to consider whether altering the length of the second stalk region of the b subunit affected interactions between the twob subunits in the hydrophilic domains. Plasmids pAUL49 (b sol+7) and pAUL50 (b solΔ7) were used to direct expression of a recombinant b sol polypeptide, and the recombinant b sol polypeptides were purified to homogeneity. The yield of recombinant b solpolypeptides obtained from approximately 2.0 g of cells (wet weight) was approximately 5 mg of pure protein. Chemical cross-linking using the irreversible agent bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate was employed to look for dimer formation by the b solproteins (Fig. 5). Cross-linking was observed for both the b sol+7 and theb solΔ7 polypeptides, indicating the presence of dimers. The cross-linked bands had the expected mobility for dimers in SDS-PAGE, and an immunoblot analysis using the anti-bsubunit antibody confirmed that the 34-kDa cross-linked product was indeed b sol polypeptide (data not shown). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were also performed to study dimer formation of the b sol+7 and theb solΔ7 polypeptides (Fig. 6). Like the b solcontrol, both the insertion and deletion polypeptides were largely in the dimeric form, and the samples contained less than 2% monomer. Concentrations of tetrameric polypeptides observed in theb sol+7 and the b solΔ7preparations were slightly higher than for b sol. The data suggested that neither the deletion nor the insertion had a large impact on dimer formation. This can be viewed as support for the dimerization domain hypothesis of McLachlin and Dunn (26McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), because the design of the insertion held this region of the protein intact impinging only slightly on the area of the b subunit defined as important for dimer formation.FIG. 6Distribution of recombinantb sol polypeptides at sedimentation equilibrium.

The solid lines are the theoretical best fit curves calculated from the known sequences of the polypeptides and assuming a nonequilibrium distribution of monomer, dimer, and tetramer (27Sorgen P.L.

In the present work, we have characterized the effects of insertion mutations designed to lengthen the second stalk region of the b subunit. Insertion of 7 amino acids resulted in an essentially normal phenotype. Abundant fully assembled and functional F1F0 ATP synthase was observed in the membranes, and experiments using the model b sol +7 polypeptide indicated a propensity for dimer formation similar to wild type b sol. As the sizes of the insertions were increased to 11 and 14 amino acids, the amounts of intact F1F0-ATP synthase present in the membranes fell, but significant levels of enzymatic activity remained. The losses of function observed in the insertion mutants represented assembly defects rather than functional failures in intact F1F0 ATP synthase complexes. The assembly defect resulting from insertion of 18 amino acids was so severe that F1F0 ATP synthase activity was completely lost and no b subunit could be detected in the membrane fractions. The most important parameter in these studies was the retention of coupled F1F0 ATP synthase function with addition of up to 14 residues. This insertion amounts to approximately four full turns of an α-helix corresponding to the capacity to extend the second stalk by up to 20 Å. Although we did not rigorously exclude the possibility of a change in secondary structure resulting from the insertions, the simple duplication of b subunit segments in these experiments and computer analysis using secondary structure prediction algorithms argue against this idea. Therefore, the maximum functional extension of the second stalk segment of the bsubunit was roughly 50% longer than that normally used to span the distance between F1 and F0 in the wild type enzyme. If the second stalk were a rigid rod-like structure, such a large insertion would be expected to result in a dramatic distortion of the complex leading to failure of the stator and loss of F1F0 ATP synthase function. The insertion mutations studies reported here and the deletions characterized earlier (28Sorgen P.L. Caviston T.L. Perry R.C. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27873-27878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) point to an interpretation that the second stalk of F1F0 ATP synthases have considerable flexibility to accommodate large changes in length. The second stalk seen in the electron micrographs of Wilkens and Capaldi (4Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) was bent. Viewing the second stalk as a flexible feature of the complex allows shortening and lengthening the b subunit to be accomplished, at least in part, by straightening or accentuating the bend. In simplistic terms, the second stalk seems much more likely to be a flexible rope that can be pulled taut, providing the tensile strength required to function as the major structural feature of the stator, rather than an inherently stiff rod. In this way, the results can be rationalized as compatible with the transient elastic storage of energy hypothesis for F1F0 ATP synthase described by Junge and colleagues (2Cherapanov D.A. Mulkidjian A.Y. Junge W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 40Junge W. Lill H. Engelbrecht S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 420-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The two structurally and functionally constrained residues, Arg-36 and Ala-79, conserved in nearly all bacterial F1F0ATP synthase b subunits are separated by exactly 43 amino acids (29McCormick K.A. Cain B.D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7240-7248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Caviston T.L. Ketchum C.J. Sorgen P.L. Nakamoto R.K. Cain B.D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All of the insertions reported here, as well as the earlier deletions (28Sorgen P.L. Caviston T.L. Perry R.C. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27873-27878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), were constructed between these two sites disturbing this apparently conserved spacing. Changes of up to 7 amino acids in either direction made very little difference in the activity of intact F1F0 ATP synthase complexes containing the altered b subunits. The remaining question is, why does there appear to be conservation of the length bacterialb subunits in the second stalk segment? The answer probably lies in optimization of assembly of the oligomeric enzyme complex during evolution. The length of the b subunit may have remained under selective pressure for positioning the bsubunit for interactions with F1 needed for efficient formation of the F1F0 ATP synthase complex. Even a small decrease in the efficiency of enzyme assembly might have constituted a selective disadvantage for procaryotic organisms competing by a strategy based on rapid proliferation during evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2061520929,"Targeted disruption of the RIIβ subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) produces lean mice that resist diet-induced obesity. In this report we examine the effects of the RIIβ knockout on white adipose tissue physiology. Loss of RIIβ is compensated by an increase in the RIα isoform, generating an isoform switch from a type II to a type I PKA. Type I holoenzyme binds cAMP more avidly and is more easily activated than the type II enzyme. These alterations are associated with increases in both basal kinase activity and the basal rate of lipolysis, possibly contributing to the lean phenotype. However, the ability of both β<sub>3</sub>-selective and nonspecific β-adrenergic agonists to stimulate lipolysis is markedly compromised in mutant white adipose tissue. This defect was found<i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> and does not result from reduced expression of β-adrenergic receptor or hormone-sensitive lipase genes. In contrast, β-adrenergic stimulated gene transcription remains intact, and the expression of key genes involved in lipid metabolism is normal under both fasted and fed conditions. We suggest that the R subunit isoform switch disrupts the subcellular localization of PKA that is required for efficient transduction of signals that modulate lipolysis but not for those that mediate gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2126128481,"Porcine aortic endothelial cells have previously been shown to contain particularly high basal levels of polyunsaturated diacylglycerol (DAG) together with a very high degree of membrane-associated protein kinase C (PKC), which is largely insensitive to further activation (Pettitt, T. R., Martin, A., Horton, T., Liossis, C., Lord, J. M., and Wakelam, M. J. O. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 17354–17359). To investigate the possibility that the high polyunsaturated DAG levels were constitutively activating PKC, we transfected porcine aortic endothelial cells with two different forms of human diacylglycerol kinase, ε and ζ. In vitro, the former is specific for polyunsaturated structures, whereas the latter shows no apparent selectivity. Overexpression of DAGKε specifically reduced the level of polyunsaturated DAG in the transfected cells while having little effect on the more saturated structures. It also caused the redistribution of PKCα and ε from the membrane to the cytosol. Overexpression of DAGKζ caused a general reduction in DAG levels but had little effect on PKC distribution. These results for the first time show that DAGKε specifically phosphorylates polyunsaturated DAGin vivo and that in so doing it regulates PKC localization and activity. This provides support for the proposal that it is the polyunsaturated DAGs that function as messengers and convincing evidence for DAGKε being a physiological terminator of DAG second messenger signaling. Porcine aortic endothelial cells have previously been shown to contain particularly high basal levels of polyunsaturated diacylglycerol (DAG) together with a very high degree of membrane-associated protein kinase C (PKC), which is largely insensitive to further activation (Pettitt, T. R., Martin, A., Horton, T., Liossis, C., Lord, J. M., and Wakelam, M. J. O. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 17354–17359).

This is generally closely followed by a second, sustained phase of diradylglycerol generation lasting for up to 60 min, characterized by more saturated species, primarily DAGs but also potentially includingsn-1-O-alkyl-2-acylglycerols andsn-1-O-alkenyl-2-acylglycerols. These second-phase diradylglycerols are often derived through a phospholipase D/phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase pathway utilizing phosphatidylcholine as substrate (1Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Sustained mitogenic stimulation also induces polyunsaturated DAG generation at much longer times, where it correlates with progression hrough the cell cycle (2Olivier A.R. Hansra G. Pettitt T.R. Wakelam M.J.O. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The best-characterized roles of these DAGs are as lipid second messengers, activating both the classical and novel PKC families (3Newton A.C. Johnson J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar,4Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). However, although all DAG species can activate PKC to some extentin vitro, we have previously proposed that the polyunsaturated forms are the true messengers under physiological conditions, whereas the more saturated DAGs have little or no activity (5Hodgkin M.H. Pettitt T.R. Martin A. Michell R.H. Pemberton A.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 200-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 6Wakelam M.J.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). An intracellular messenger needs a mechanism of generation that can be rapidly activated in response to the appropriate stimulus. However, it also requires an equally rapid and specific mechanism of removal to terminate the signal. A major route for the removal of DAG is through phosphorylation catalyzed by diacylglycerol kinase (DAGK) to form phosphatidic acid (PA) (7Sakane F. Kanoh H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1139-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This enzyme exists as at least eight different isoforms that, on the basis of their structure, have been separated into five classes. Each shows a slightly different tissue distribution. Only one, DAGKε, a type III enzyme found at high levels in testis but also present in other tissues has been shown to exhibit differential selectivity in vitro, where it preferentially phosphorylates polyunsaturated DAG, particularlysn-1-acyl-2-arachidonyl glycerol (8Tang W. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10237-10241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that DAGKε could be responsible for terminating the polyunsaturated DAG intracellular messenger signal; however, this has not been shown in vivo. Although PA is a putative messenger itself and is required for progression from G1 into S phase in interleukin-2-stimulated mouse CTLL-2 cells (9Flores I. Casaseca T. Martinez-A C. Kanoh H. Merida I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10334-10340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), polyunsaturated PA formed by DAGKε is probably inactive as an intracellular signal (5Hodgkin M.H.

Sci. 1998; 23: 200-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) as it is rapidly utilized to reform phosphoinositide. To determine if distinct DAGK isoforms have distinct in vivosubstrates, we transfected porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells with human DAGKε and DAGKζ, then examined the effect on DAG composition and PKC distribution. Cells transfected with DAGKε have significantly reduced polyunsaturated DAG as compared with the very high levels seen in the parental cells (10Pettitt T.R. Martin A. Horton T. Liossis C. Lord J.M.

All solvents were of Analytical or HPLC grade from Fisher. Lipid standards were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., Alabaster, AL. Other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The cDNA for DAGKε was cloned into pcDNA1/Neo (Invitrogen), whereas that for DAGKζ was cloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) (Invitrogen); they were generously provided by Drs. M. K. Topham and S. M. Prescott, Eccles Institute of Human Genetics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT. DAGK antibodies raised in rabbit as described previously (11Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M.

Mouse monoclonal PKCα and ε antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories. PAE cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture containing Glutamax, 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin and used upon reaching 70–80% confluency. Most cells were serum-starved for 24 h before use. Transfection was by electroporation. Geneticin was (100 μg/ml) used to select clones expressing human DAGKε, whereas zeocin (100 μg/ml) was used to select clones expressing human DAGKζ. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline then incubated for 15 min in Ham's F-12 containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V; Sigma) at 37 °C before stimulation with 10 μm sn-1-18 :1n-9,2-lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) where described. Incubations were terminated by aspiration of the media followed by the addition of ice-cold methanol and 1 μg of 1,2-12:0/12.0 DAG internal standard. Lipids were extracted, and diradylglycerols were derivatized and analyzed by HPLC as described previously (12Pettitt T.R. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem.

Data are expressed as means ± S.D., wheren = 3–6. Cells were labeled with myo-[2-3H]inositol (0.5 μCi/ml) in inositol-free medium for 48 h and stimulated in the presence of 20 mm LiCl with vehicle or LPA (10 μm), and the inositol phosphates were analyzed as described previously (14Wakelam M.J.O. Murphy G.J. Hruby V.J. Houslay M.D. Nature. 1986; 323: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). PAE cells stimulated with LPA (10 μm) for 20 s and 5 min where described were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. The samples were frozen at −70 °C overnight, thawed, and sonicated for 20 s in a bath sonicator, and membranes and cytosol were separated by centrifugation (300,000 ×g, 20 min). The membranes were washed once. The cytosolic proteins were concentrated by precipitation with 12.5% trichloroacetic acid (4 °C, 1 h) and centrifugation (13,000 ×g, 10 min), and the pellet was washed with 200 μl of ice-cold acetone. The cytosolic and membrane proteins were solubilized by boiling in 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 4 m urea, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, bromphenol blue for 5 min, then cell fraction equivalents were separated by electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide minigels. After transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore), the PKC isozymes were probed using mouse monoclonal antibodies to PKCα (1 in 2500 dilution) and PKCε (1 in 2500) and detected using enhanced chemiluminescence. DAGK isozymes were probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to DAGKε (1 in 2000) and DAGKζ (1 in 1000). Cells grown in 10-cm dishes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed for 15 min at 4 °C with 1 ml of ice-cold hypertonic lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mmEDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture; (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), scraped into Eppendorf tubes, sonicated for 5 min in a sonicating bath cooled with ice, centrifuged (13000 × g, 5 min), and the cleared supernatant was transferred to clean tubes. Each sample was mixed for 1 h at 4 °C with 5 μl of mouse monoclonal PKC antibody followed by a further 30 min with 10 μl of goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma). Each sample was then split into two equal fractions and mixed with 50 μl of 20% Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation (13,000 × g, 5 min), the immunoprecipitate pellet was washed four times with 500 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 75 mm KCl, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and then resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer. To the immunoprecipitate was added 5 μl of PKC substrate (either histone type IIIS or neurogranin fragment, amino acids 28–43; 1 mg/ml; Sigma) in kinase buffer, 10 μl of lipid micelle mix (500 μm phosphatidylserine, 100 μm mixed DAG, 0.5% Triton X-100 in kinase buffer), and 5 μl of kinase buffer (or 5 μm tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate in kinase buffer for the positive controls). 10 μl of 100 μm ATP containing 0.5 μCi of [32P]ATP was added to start the reaction. After incubation (1 h, 30 °C), the reaction was stopped with 20 μl of 5% acetic acid. The phosphorylated substrate was separated by electrophoresis on 17.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for histone, whereas with the neurogranin fragment each sample was spotted onto P81 cation exchange paper (Whatman), air dried, washed 4 × 10 min with 500 ml of 0.5% phosphoric acid and washed once with 95% ethanol. The32P-phosphorylated substrate was detected and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Expression of DAGKε and DAGKζ in parental PAE cells and DAGK-transfected clones was examined by Western blotting. Although the parental cells express both enzymes, the clones showed enhanced levels with 2–4-fold increases in DAGKε (64 kDa) and 5–10-fold increases in DAGKζ (115 kDa; Fig. 1). Preparation of cytosolic and membrane fractions revealed that these enzymes were restricted to the membrane fraction both in resting and LPA-stimulated cells (data not shown). The identities of the immunoreactive bands at approximately 90 and 100 kDa in the DAGKζ blot remain unclear but may be cleavage products of the parent 115-kDa protein. The parental cells grew faster than the DAGK clones with doubling times of 21, 26, and 36 h (based on cell numbers after different culture times) for parental, DAGKε clone 7, and DAGKζ clone 7 cells, respectively. The growth of both the parental and transfected PAE cells was largely insensitive to serum starvation for 48 h (starved from approximately 30% confluency), with only a 20% increase in cell-doubling time. The DAGK clones have a greatly increased propensity to align into ordered swirls when fully confluent (Fig. 2). The degree of order varied between clones but appeared to correlate with the level of DAGK expression; those expressing more enzyme showed greater alignment. The DAGKζ clones always showed this arrangement at confluency. The DAGKε clones were more variable, sometimes showing ordered alignment into swirls and sometimes not, whereas the parental cells only occasionally showed a partial ordering. This variability with the parental and DAGKε clones may relate to differences in the relative concentrations of cytokines and growth factors in different batches of cell culture serum and how these affect the DAG and/or PA signaling pathways modulated by DAGK. PAE cells contain high levels of polyunsaturated DAG under resting conditions, and these remain largely insensitive to further stimulation (10Pettitt T.R. Martin A. Horton T. Liossis C. Lord J.M. Wakelam M.J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17354-17359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). If DAGKε had the same specificity in vivo asin vitro, overexpression of active enzyme would be expected to reduce these levels. Thus, total lipid extracts were prepared, derivatized with 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl chloride, and separated by HPLC to resolve the different DAG molecular species. Fig. 3 shows a comparison of DAG profiles from one DAGKε clone and the parental cells, both grown in 10% serum. Polyunsaturated species whose levels are greatly reduced in the clone, including sn-1-stearoyl,2-eicosatrienoyl glycerol (18:0/20:3n-9; peak 16) and sn-1-stearoyl,2-arachidonyl glycerol (18:0/20:4n-6; peak 12), are marked with an asterisk. Other DAGKε clones gave similar results with greatly reduced polyunsaturated DAG levels but little change in more saturated species, as summarized in Table I. Overexpression of DAGKε reduced total DAG mass by approximately 40% (3.4 ± 0.5 compared with 5.4 ± 0.8 nmol/107 cells). This is almost entirely due to the loss of polyunsaturated structures, particularly 18:0/20:3n-9 and 18:0/20:4n-6, which together account for approximately 1.6nmol/107 cells in the parental cells but only 0.1nmol/107 cells in the DAGKε clones. Serum starvation for 24 h had little effect on the DAG profiles but did reduce total mass by about 65% (from 3.9 ± 0.5 to 1.4 ± 0.2 nmol/107 cells in DAGKε clone 8). The DAGKζ clones showed very little change in the DAG species profiles relative to the parental cells (data not shown). However, the basal DAG levels were approximately halved relative to the parental cells when grown either in 10% serum (2.7 ± 0.5 nmol/107 cells compared with 5.4 ± 0.8 nmol/107 cells) or serum-free (1.8 ± 0.4 nmol/107 cells compared with 3.6 ± 0.5 nmol/107 cells).Table IBasal 1,2-diacylglycerol composition of parental and DAGKɛ-transfected PAE cells grown in 10% serumPeak1,2-Diacylglycerol speciesParentalDAGKɛ Clonespmol/107cells%pmol/107cells%MeanS.D.

Open table in a new tab We next investigated whether the reduced basal polyunsaturated DAG levels in the DAGKε clones had reestablished the potential for agonist-induced activation of phosphoinositide PLC as measured by rapid polyunsaturated DAG production and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate release. LPA stimulation for 25 s, 1 min, or 5 min caused no consistent inositol phosphate generation and had no significant effect on polyunsaturated DAG levels (data not shown). However, after 5 min, LPA did cause a small elevation in more saturated species, particularly 18:1n-9/18:1n-9, which increased from 247 pmol/107 cells to 455 pmol/107 cells. These were probably generated through the phospholipase D/phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase pathway since we previously reported that butan-1-ol completely blocked the formation of these structures in LPA-stimulated PAE cells (10Pettitt T.R. Martin A. Horton T. Liossis C. Lord J.M. Wakelam M.J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17354-17359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Taken together, the data indicate that LPA is unable to stimulate an increased phosphoinositide PLC activity in these cells, even if basal polyunsaturated DAG levels are greatly reduced. We have shown previously that essentially all the PKCα and approximately 50% of the PKCε was associated with the membrane fraction in resting PAE cells (10Pettitt T.R. Martin A. Horton T. Liossis C. Lord J.M. Wakelam M.J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17354-17359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this was due to the high basal levels of polyunsaturated DAG, in effect, constitutively activating the enzyme and driving it onto the membrane. Thus by reducing the polyunsaturated DAG levels, more PKC should be found in the cytosol. Therefore we compared the PKC distribution in the DAGKε clones with that in the parental cells, both cultured for the last 24 h under either serum-free or 10% serum conditions. When cultured in serum-free conditions, the clones with their reduced levels of polyunsaturated DAG, but not the parental cells, showed PKC redistribution to the cytosol (Fig. 4). PKCα was approximately 95% membrane associated in the parentals compared with about 50% in the clones, whereas for PKCε the membrane association was approximately 60% compared with about 40%. For the parental cells and the clones cultured in 10% serum, nearly all the PKCα was on the membrane, whereas for PKCε about 60% was on the membrane. Serum-starved parental cells show essentially the same PKC distribution as that seen when grown in 10% serum. Stimulation with LPA for 20 s and 5 min had no obvious effect on PKC distribution (data not shown). Total PKCα expression in the DAGK clones was similar to that seen in the parental cells; however, PKCε expression was elevated in the DAGKε clones and probably also the DAGKζ clones, although there was some variability between individual clones. The DAGKζ clones showed a PKC distribution almost identical to that in the parental cells under both serum conditions (Fig. 5).FIG. 5Effect of DAGK ζ overexpression on PKC distribution. Cytosol and membrane fractions were prepared from cells grown for the last 24 h either in serum-free or 10% serum conditions, separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and analyzed by Western blotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate if DAGK transfection altered PKC kinase activities, PKCα and ε were immunoprecipitated from total lysates, and their abilities to phosphorylate histone or a PKC substrate peptide (amino acids 28 to 43 from neurogranin) were examined in the presence or absence of the phorbol ester, tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA). Although somewhat variable, PKCα activity was generally similar in the parental and DAGK clones, both, under basal and phorbol ester-stimulated conditions (Fig. 6 A). For PKCε, basal activity was highest in the DAGKζ clones and lowest in the parental cells (Fig. 6 B). Although not statistically significant, the data also suggested a small increase in stimulatable PKCε activity, particularly in the DAGKζ clones. Since 500 nm TPA is believed to maximally activate all DAG-sensitive PKCs in vitro, the activity seen in the presence of phorbol ester is taken to correlate with total PKC content in the immunoprecipitates. Thus, in Fig. 6, C and D, the basal PKC activity is expressed as a percentage of maximal activity (+ TPA). This gives an approximation to the relative PKC specific activities under resting conditions. DAGK overexpression had essentially no effect on basal PKCα activity, which remained at approximately 50% maximal. In contrast, PKCε activity was substantially increased, particularly in the DAGKζ clone, where the protein kinase was almost fully activated under basal conditions. DAGK is a ubiquitous enzyme with roles in phospholipid synthesis and cell signaling. Most studies to date have reported the purification, structural identification and, in vitrocharacterization of novel isoforms. The data presented here provide the first demonstration that DAGK can modulate DAG levels in cells. In addition, the results show the selective modulation of DAG species levels by a particular isoform, DAGKε, but not by DAGKζ. This demonstrates that the substrate specificity suggested by in vitro studies (8Tang W. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10237-10241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 11Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10230-10236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) does indeed occur in vivo. The selective removal of polyunsaturated DAG by DAGKε is accompanied by regulation of the cellular distribution of PKCα and ε. This provides support for the proposition that polyunsaturated DAG, presumably derived through a phospholipase C pathway, is the true signaling form of this lipid, whereas the more saturated species derived through a phospholipase D/phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase pathway are largely inactive. DAGKε clones grown in 10% serum showed a similar PKC distribution to the parental cells; however, when grown for 24 h in serum-free media, the PKC redistributed to the cytosol (Fig. 4). Growth in the absence of serum greatly reduced the total DAG mass (1.4 nmol/107 cells as compared with 3.9 nmol/107cells) but had no effect upon the DAG species profiles. Thus the reduction in polyunsaturated DAG mass must be sufficient to cause PKC redistribution. In DAGKε clone 8, 16:0/20:4n-6, 18:0/20:4n-6, and 18:0/20:3n-9 together represented 71 pmol/107 cells under serum-free conditions as compared with 252 pmol/107 cells when grown in 10% serum. In the parental cells, although total DAG mass dropped after a 24-h serum-free incubation (3.6 nmol/107 cells as compared with 5.4 nmol/107cells), the total polyunsaturated DAG mass remained greater at 917 pmol/107 cells than that seen in the DAGKε clones grown with 10% serum. In these parental cells the PKC distribution under serum-free conditions remained similar to that seen in 10% serum, with most enzyme at the membrane (Fig. 4). Thus the key regulator of PKC redistribution is the absolute mass of polyunsaturated DAG in a cell rather than its proportion relative to more saturated species. However, it should also be noted that different subcellular localizations might contribute to the differential effect of the two DAGK forms on PKC distribution. If DAGKζ and the PKCs are localized to different compartments, then DAGK modulation of local DAG levels may not affect the PKC found elsewhere in the cell. In contrast, co-localization would be expected to have a larger effect on PKC activation. The activity data for PKCα (Fig. 6, A and C) support the idea that although different amounts of PKC may be at the membrane under basal conditions, to maintain homeostasis the cell only needs a certain level of kinase activity and, thus, modulates it accordingly, resulting in similar activities for the parental and DAGK-transfected cells. The activity in the presence of phorbol ester indicates that the three cell lines have similar total levels of PKCα. In contrast, the data for PKCε suggest that there is more enzyme in the DAGK clones (Fig. 6 B). This agrees with the Western blot data where more PKCε was detected in the transfected cells (Figs. 4 and 5). The increased kinase activity in the immunoprecipitates under basal conditions may partly reflect these elevated enzyme levels, although the PKCε-specific activity appeared to be higher than in the parental cells, particularly for the DAGKζ clones (Fig. 6 D). However, since the enzyme had to be immunoprecipitated and then assayedin vitro, introducing a variety of nonphysiological changes, we would argue that the PKC redistribution data are a more reliable measure of PKC activation in vivo, although not necessarily of kinase activity. In keeping with this, the increase in PKCε protein observed in the DAGK transfectants presumably reflects a reduction in the membrane polyunsaturated DAG concentration reducing the down-regulation of enzyme levels. The molecular size of DAGKζ calculated from its nucleotide sequence is 103.9 kDa, but as reported previously, it runs slightly slower than this on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (11Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10230-10236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells transfected with the DAGKζ gene expressed a doublet of 114 and 117 kDa as did nontransfected human glioblastoma-derived A-172 cells (11Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10230-10236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar); however, both parental and transfected PAE cells expressed a band of approximately 115 kDa together with variable amounts of possible cleavage products at approximately 90 and 100 kDa (Fig. 1). Tissue-specific splice variants may be common since a 130-kDa form has been found in human skeletal tissue, although its properties appear identical to those of the 114-kDa form (15Ding L. Bunting M. Topham M.K. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5519-5524Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The higher DAGK protein expression achieved with the DAGKζ clones (5–10-fold above parental) as compared with the DAGKε clones (2–4 fold) suggests that the latter isozyme is probably more toxic to the cell, causing cell death when present at slightly elevated levels. This is a common problem with overexpressing lipases or other lipid-metabolizing enzymes, since only small changes can cause major membrane damage and resultant cell death. This sensitivity is likely to be greatest for enzymes involved in lipid signaling. To maintain membrane integrity and capacity for signaling, PIP2, the substrate for PLC-catalyzed polyunsaturated DAG messenger generation, must be rapidly resynthesized. The first step, catalyzed by DAGK, terminates the polyunsaturated DAG signal by forming polyunsaturated PA. This is the preferred substrate for at least one form of CDP-DAG synthase (16Saito S. Goto K. Tonosaki A. Kondo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9503-9509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), generating CDP-DAG (or CMP-PA), which is then utilized by phosphatidylinositol synthase for phosphoinositide synthesis (17Lykidis A. Jackson P.D. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33402-33409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Sequential phosphorylation then regenerates PIP2. Both DAGKε (18Walsh J.P. Suen R. Glomset J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28647-28653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and rat brain CDP-DAG synthase (16Saito S. Goto K. Tonosaki A. Kondo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9503-9509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) are strongly inhibited by PIP2 in vitro, providing a potential negative-feedback mechanism to regulate phosphoinositide generation. Overexpression of DAGKε would alter this balance since enhanced removal of polyunsaturated DAG would reduce the PKC activation, which negatively regulates PLC activity (13Pettitt T.R. Zaqqa M. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), potentially leading to sustained PIP2 hydrolysis. This would deplete PIP2 levels, releasing PIP2 inhibition of CDP-DAG synthase and DAGKε as the cell attempts to replenish phosphoinositide. As a result the cell may become locked into an energy-draining futile cycle, which if uncontrolled, would ultimately kill it. DAGK overexpression, particularly DAGKζ, induced a noticeable change in cell morphology at confluency (Fig. 2) possibly through effects on membrane fluidity caused by the reduction in total diradylglycerol levels. However, the observation that DAGKζ is found at high levels within the nucleus and has a myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate homology region that can act as a nuclear localization sequence (15Ding L. Bunting M. Topham M.K. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5519-5524Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) suggests that its effects maybe exerted primarily within this organelle. Phosphorylation of this domain by PKCα or PKCγ has been shown to cause DAGKζ translocation out of the nucleus and away from its presumed substrate, nuclear DAG (20Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Blocking this translocation by PKC down-regulation or overexpression of DAGKζ in the nucleus increased the cell cycle time (20Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). A nuclear localization would fit with our observations that DAGKζ is associated almost entirely with the membrane fraction from PAE cell lysates, since this would contain ruptured nuclei; also, that the cell doubling time was longest for the DAGKζ clones. Recent work with mouse DAGKζ, which shows a 95% homology with the human form, found that expression is regulated both temporally and spatially during embryonic development and correlates with the development of sensory neurones and regions undergoing apoptosis (21Ding L. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for this enzyme in gene regulation. Thus its overexpression may lead to an abnormal expression of other genes and hence morphological change, possibly of the type observed here. Overexpression of DAGKε may partially mimic the effects of DAGKζ, resulting in the more variable morphology seen at confluency in the DAGKε clones. In conclusion DAGKε, but not DAGKζ, modulates PKCα and ε activation by specifically regulating the endogenous levels of polyunsaturated-signaling DAG and, by generating polyunsaturated PA, initiates the resynthesis of the parent phosphoinositide.

Pollegioni L. Recent Res. Dev. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1998; 1: 285-298Google Scholar) and as a model system for mechanistic studies (2Pollegioni L. Blodig W. Ghisla S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4924-4934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In contrast to the well known pig kidney DAAO (3Curti B. Ronchi S. Pilone Simonetta M. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 69-94Google Scholar), the enzyme from R. gracilis is characterized by a comparatively much higher turnover number, good stability under a wide range of reaction conditions, and an active site sufficiently large to accommodate different substrates, even of considerable size (4Pollegioni L.

Due to these properties, we have utilized the yeast enzyme for the oxidation of cephalosporin C in the two-step formation of 7-aminocephalosporanic acid (6Pilone M.S. Butò S. Pollegioni L. Biotechnol. Lett. 1995; 17: 199-204Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and for a human gene therapy paradigm that involves oxidant-mediated tumor cell death (7Stegman L.D. Zheng H. Neal E.R. Ben-Yoseph O. Pollegioni L. Pilone M.S. Ross B.D. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). DAAO catalyzes the oxidation of d-amino acids to α-keto acids and ammonia with concomitant reduction of molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. In the reductive half-reaction, the amino acid substrate reduces the enzyme-bound FAD cofactor producing reduced flavin and the imino acid. In the oxidative half-reaction, the reduced FAD·imino acid complex reacts with molecular oxygen to form oxidized FAD·imino acid. The catalytic cycle is completed when the imino acid dissociates from the re-oxidized enzyme. Solvolysis of the initial imino acid product rapidly yields the corresponding α-keto acid and ammonia. The enzyme has a broad substrate specificity, utilizing all of the naturally occurring amino acids efficiently, with the only exceptions being aspartate and glutamate (3Curti B. Ronchi S. Pilone Simonetta M. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 69-94Google Scholar, 4Pollegioni L. Falbo A. Pilone M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). RgDAAO belongs to the large class of flavoprotein oxidases that catalyze the oxidation of amino or α-hydroxy acids. A fundamental question remains within this class of enzymes regarding the mechanism by which a proton and two electrons are transferred from the substrate to the flavin N-5 position during the reductive half-reaction. Substrate oxidation could be accomplished by hydride transfer from the α-carbon to the flavin N-5. Whereas hydride transfer certainly requires stringent orientation of the substrate and flavin cofactor, there is no theoretical argument against it (8Miura R. Miyake Y. Bioorg. Chem. 1988; 16: 97-110Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A carbanion mechanism has been proposed in which an enzyme base removes the α-proton (or possibly the amino proton) and so forms a carbanion intermediate (9Walsh C.T. Schonbrunn A. Abeles R. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 248: 6855-6866Google Scholar) (see also Ref. 10Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Curti B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar for a recent review). The resulting unstable carbanion would rapidly attack the N-5 locus of the flavin. Subsequent rapid rearrangement would result in reduced flavin and iminopyruvate. The most convincing evidence in favor of a carbanion mechanism is the observation of β-elimination when β-chloroalanine was used as the substrate of pig kidney DAAO (9Walsh C.T. Schonbrunn A. Abeles R. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 248: 6855-6866Google Scholar). Deprotonation of the α-hydrogen of amino acids is highly unfavorable in aqueous solution. Thus, in order for an enzyme to deprotonate the α-proton, it must have some highly specific means of removing the proton and stabilizing the resulting carbanion. Hence, the presence of an enzyme base for α-proton abstraction is essential for the carbanion mechanism. In order to determine the mechanism of substrate dehydrogenation, we are currently studying the active site of RgDAAO using different experimental approaches.

Arg-285, Tyr-238, and Tyr-223 are the only residues conserved in the amino acid sequence of DAAOs from pig, R. gracilis, and Trigonopsis variabilis (14Faotto L. Pollegioni L. Ceciliani F. Ronchi S. Pilone M.S. Biotechnol. Lett. 1995; 17: 193-198Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of Tyr-238 is in progress and that of Arg-285 has shown this residue not to be essential for catalysis, 2L. Pollegioni, personal communication. and the study of Tyr-223 has been now completed. In this paper we report the production and characterization of Y223F and Y223S mutants of RgDAAO. The clarification of the role of the active-site residues of RgDAAO and the resolution of the three-dimensional structure are prerequisite for the identification of the molecular basis of the kinetics, higher catalytic efficiency, substrate specificity, and flavin binding properties that differentiate RgDAAO from the mammalian enzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis has a second application with regard to the use of RgDAAO as a biocatalyst (for a review see Ref. 1Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Recent Res. Dev. Biotechnol.

All experiments were performed in 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, pH 8.5, 1% glycerol, 0.3 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm2-mercaptoethanol and at 25 °C, except where stated otherwise. The RgDAAO-Y223F mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Altered Sites™ II Kit; the cDNA coding for the wild-type RgDAAO was subcloned in theEcoRI pALTER-1™ vector. The plasmid was then purified as single strand DNA by phage infection (as described in the Promega protocol) and used as a template for the in vitromutagenesis reactions. The mutant was generated using a dual primer method to introduce simultaneously a site-directed mutation (Y223F2, CCCGCTTCTCCCGCATTCATCATTCCCCGA, the codon for phenylalanine is underlined) and ampicillin resistance. In vitro mutagenesis reaction products were used to transform competent Escherichia coli ES1301 mutS cells and finallyE. coli JM109 cells (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.P. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Successful mutagenesis was screened for the insertion of a new BsmI site (GAAT(G/C)N) by restriction analysis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The Y223S mutant was generated by mutagenic polymerase chain reaction. The plasmid pCRII-DAAOwt carrying the wild-type RgDAAO cDNA (16Pollegioni L. Molla G. Campaner S. Martegani E. Pilone M.S. J. Biotechnol. 1997; 58: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was used as the template in the amplification reactions. The DNA was amplified using the Y223S upstream primer (CAATCCGCGGGCAAACCGTCCTCGTCAAGTCCCCATGCAAGCGATGCACGATGGACTCGTCCGACCCCGCTTCTCCCGCCTCCATCATTC, the codon for serine is underlined), which carried the punctiform mutation, and the 3′ downstream primer (CTTGTAGATGCCCGCAATACAG). The latter was designed to anneal after the poly(A) tail of the cDNA. The amplification product was cloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutation. A cassette (SacII and HindIII) containing the mutant Y223S was exchanged with the corresponding fragment of pKK-DAAO plasmid (16Pollegioni L. Molla G. Campaner S. Martegani E. Pilone M.S. J. Biotechnol. 1997; 58: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The complete RgDAAO-Y223S and RgDAAO-Y223F cDNAs were subcloned into the EcoRI site of the pT7.7A expression vector (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), and the mutated region was sequenced again. The new expression plasmids were designated pT7-Y223S and pT7-Y223F and were used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) and BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen Inc.). During purification, DAAO activity was assayed with an oxygen electrode at pH 8.5 and 25 °C with 28 mmd-alanine as substrate (4Pollegioni L. Falbo A. Pilone M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). One DAAO unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that converts 1 μmol of d-alanine per min, at 25 °C. Analytical SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out as described by Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The Y223S and Y223F RgDAAO mutants were expressed in E. coli using the recently developed pT7-DAAO expression system in BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli cells (18Molla G. Vegezzi C. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A fermentor (PPS-3, Bioindustrie Mantovane) containing 10 liters of Luria Bertani medium, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol was inoculated with 500 ml of an overnight culture of pT7-Y223S or pT7-Y223F expression system (A 600 = 3.2). Cells were grown at 37 °C for 2.5 h (A 600 = 1.0) and then induced with 0.6 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration). Induced cells were grown at 30 °C for 21 h and then harvested by centrifugation and stored at −20 °C. Purification of both Y223F and Y223S mutants was performed by the identical procedure as for recombinant wild-type RgDAAO (18Molla G. Vegezzi C. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The extinction coefficients for the mutant DAAO enzymes were determined by measuring the change in absorbance after release of the flavin. The enzymes were heat-denatured by boiling for 5 min in the dark; an extinction coefficient of 11,300m−1 cm−1 at 450 nm for free FAD was used. An anaerobic cuvette containing 7.5 μm enzyme, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 μm 5-deazaflavin was made anaerobic and photoreduced with a 250-watt lamp, with the cuvette immersed in a 0 °C water bath. Progress of the reaction was followed spectrophotometrically. When the semiquinone peak at 370 nm reached its maximal value, 15 min irradiation, 5 μm benzyl viologen was added from a side arm of the cuvette, and the absorbance changes were followed for up to 24 h at 15 °C. Redox potentials for theEFlox/EFlseq andEFlseq/EFlred couples (where EFlox is oxidized enzyme; EFlseq is enzyme flavin semiquinone; andE red and EFlred, reduced enzymes) of Y223F and Y223S mutants were determined by the method of dye equilibration (19Minnaert K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 110: 42-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the xanthine/xanthine oxidase (XO) reduction system, at 15 °C (20Massey V. Curti B. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1991: 59-66Google Scholar). An anaerobic cuvette containing 7 μm enzyme, 0.2 mm xanthine, 5 μm benzyl viologen, and 1–10 μm of the appropriate dye was purged of oxygen, and the reaction was initiated by addition of 10 nm XO. The reaction was measured spectrophotometrically until completion, typically 3–4 h. Data were analyzed as described by Minnaert (19Minnaert K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 110: 42-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of oxidized and reduced dye was determined at a wavelength where the enzyme has no absorbance (>550 nm), and the amount of oxidized and reduced enzyme was determined at an isosbestic point for the dye or by subtraction of the dye's contribution in the 400–470 nm region. Dissociation constants for ligands were measured spectrophotometrically by addition of small volumes (1–10 μl) of concentrated stock solutions to samples containing 1 ml of 7–11 μm enzyme, at 15 °C. The change in absorbance upon adding ligand was plotted as a function of ligand concentration, after correction for any volume change. Wavelengths used for the ligands are 497 nm for sodium benzoate and sodium crotonate, 456 nm for sodium sulfite, 540 nm for sodium anthranilate, and 485 nm for CF3-alanine. Specificity for l-amino acids was checked by following the change in the absorbance spectrum after anaerobic addition of the amino acid to the enzyme solution. The experiments were performed at 25 °C in a thermostatted stopped-flow spectrophotometer with a 2-cm path length cell and that is equipped with a diode array detector as described previously (2Pollegioni L. Blodig W. Ghisla S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4924-4934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetic analysis was performed by the method of enzyme-monitored turnover by mixing air-saturated enzyme, 10 μm (final concentration), with air-saturated solutions of d-alanine at 25 °C. Traces at 456 nm were analyzed as described previously (21Gibson Q.H. Swoboda B.E.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 259: 3927-3934Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) using the Kaleidagraph program (Synergy Software). The ternary complex mechanism shown in the inner loop of Scheme 1 can be described using the conventions of Dalziel (22Dalziel K. Biochem. J. 1969; 114: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) as shown in Equations 1 and 2. et/v=Φ0+ΦAA/[AA]+ΦO2/[O2]+ΦAAO2/[AA][O2](Eq. 1) where (AA indicates d-amino acid) kcat=1/Φ0;Km(D­Ala)=ΦAA/Φ0;Km,O2=ΦO2/Φ0etv=k2+k4k2·k4+k−1+k2k1·k2[AA]+k2+k−2k2·k3[O2]+k−1+k−2k1·k2·k3[AA][O2](Eq. 2) For reductive half-reaction experiments, the stopped-flow instrument was made anaerobic by overnight equilibration with concentrated sodium dithionite solutions. Prior to use, the instrument was well rinsed with nitrogen-bubbled buffer to remove the dithionite. The reaction was followed by taking spectra with a diode array detector from 3 ms until completion. Reaction rates were calculated by extracting traces at individual wavelengths (456 and 530 nm) and fitting them to a sum of exponentials equation using Program A (developed in the laboratory of Dr. David P. Ballou at the University of Michigan). Subsequent analysis of k obs values determined with Program A were fit by non-linear least means squares procedures with Kaleidagraph. Unlike the wild-type RgDAAO, formation of the E red·IA complex for study of the oxidative half-reaction could not be obtained by addition of stoichiometricd-alanine in the presence of pyruvate and ammonia. Instead the xanthine/XO system was used. A tonometer with an anaerobic cuvette was loaded with a 4.5-ml solution containing 16–18 μmmutant DAAO in buffer A (50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, pH 8.5, 1% glycerol, 20 mm sodium pyruvate and 0.4m ammonium chloride), 84 nm XO, 4 μm methyl viologen, and 9 μm cresyl violet (for Y223F-DAAO) or 4 μm benzyl viologen and 1.3 μm indigo disulfonate (for Y223S-DAAO). The sample was made anaerobic, and enzyme reduction was initiated by addition of 400 μm xanthine. The sample required about 2 h for full reduction. The pre-reduced enzyme was loaded onto the stopped-flow instrument under anaerobic conditions. It was then reacted with solutions of buffer A that had been bubbled at 25 °C with air, commercially available N2/O2 mixtures (90/10, 50/50), or pure oxygen. Data were collected and analyzed as described for the reductive half-reaction. The pT7-Y223F and pT7-Y223S plasmids were used to transform BL21(DE3) and BL21(DE3)pLysSE. coli cells, and the induction conditions were investigated with both expression systems by Western blot analysis and DAAO activity assay. Analogously to the wild-type RgDAAO (18Molla G. Vegezzi C. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the highest level of DAAO expression and DAAO specific activity was obtained when the BL21(DE3) E. coli carried the pLysS plasmid (8.7 units/mg protein and 0.07 units/mg protein for the Y223F and Y223S mutants, respectively), inducing the cells with 0.6 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside at saturation (A 600 ≥ 2.0) and growing at 30 °C for additional 3–24 h. Typically 45–75 mg of pure enzyme was isolated from 10 liters of bacterial growth of Y223S or Y223F, compared with 180 mg for wild-type DAAO (18Molla G. Vegezzi C. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Both Y223F and Y223S mutations yielded well behaved enzymes that retained their FAD prosthetic group and that were stable when stored at −20 °C for several months. Visible spectra of Y223F and Y223S enzymes are shown in Fig. 1 in comparison to the wild-type RgDAAO. Both mutants, in their oxidized state, show an extinction coefficient at 455 nm of 12750 m−1 cm−1 and a ratio of A 274/A 455 ≈ 8.7. Anaerobic addition of an excess of d-alanine (Fig. 1) resulted in instantaneous enzyme reduction of both mutant DAAOs, with a spectrum like that of the wild type. The amount of semiquinone form stabilized by each mutant was determined by anaerobic photoreduction (23Massey V. Hemmerich P. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) until the spectrum of the flavin semiquinone (EFlseq) reached a maximum (Fig. 1); this species represents near-complete formation ofEFlseq (≈ 95%). The maximal semiquinone formed by photoreduction is a kinetically stabilized species. Anaerobic addition of benzyl viologen resulted in dismutation ofEFlseq to the oxidized and reduced forms over a period of 15 min with the end point containing the thermodynamically stabilized amount of semiquinone. Y223F and Y223S enzymes stabilized 60 and 63%, respectively, of the red, anionic flavin semiquinone, compared with 65% for the wild type (Table I). Stabilization of the anionic semiquinone is typical for d-amino-acid oxidases and for the family of flavoprotein oxidases (24Massey V. Gibson Q.H. Fed. Proc. U. S. A. 1964; 23: 18-29Google Scholar).Table ISemiquinone formation and stabilization and redox potentials of wild-type, Y223F, and Y223S d-amino-acid oxidasesSemiquinone measuredE 0′1E 0′2E mKinetically stabilizedThermodynamically stabilized%mVWild-type≥9565−60aThe redox potentials were measured at pH 8.5 and 15 °C using methylene blue (−29 mV) as redox standards, and xanthine/xanthine oxidase as the source of reducing equivalents (20).−200bThe redox potentials were measured at pH 8.5 and 15 °C using indigo disulfonate (−159 mV) as redox standards, and xanthine/xanthine oxidase as the source of reducing equivalents (20).−130Y223S≥9560−36aThe redox potentials were measured at pH 8.5 and 15 °C using methylene blue (−29 mV) as redox standards, and xanthine/xanthine oxidase as the source of reducing equivalents (20).−170bThe redox potentials were measured at pH 8.5 and 15 °C using indigo disulfonate (−159 mV) as redox standards, and xanthine/xanthine oxidase as the source of reducing equivalents (20).−103Y223F9063−59aThe redox potentials were measured at pH 8.5 and 15 °C using methylene blue (−29 mV) as redox standards, and xanthine/xanthine oxidase as the source of reducing equivalents (20).−203cThe redox potentials were measured at pH 8.5 and 15 °C using cresyl violet (−197 mV) as redox standards, and xanthine/xanthine oxidase as the source of reducing equivalents (20).−131a The redox potentials were measured at pH 8.5 and 15 °C using methylene blue (−29 mV) as redox standards, and xanthine/xanthine oxidase as the source of reducing equivalents (20Massey V.

Open table in a new tab In order to assess changes in the thermodynamic properties of the flavin center caused by mutation at Tyr-223, the redox potentials of the enzymes were measured by the dye equilibration method of Minnaert (19Minnaert K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 110: 42-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the xanthine/XO reduction system (20Massey V. Curti B. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1991: 59-66Google Scholar). A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 2 in which the potential of theEFlox/EFlseq couple of Y223F was measured in reference to methylene blue. A replot (Fig. 2,inset) of the log (oxidized/reduced) methylene blue as a function of log (oxidized/semiquinone) flavin species gives the potential of theEFlox/EFlseq couple when the potential of the indicator is known (19Minnaert K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 110: 42-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The line plotted in theinset of Fig. 2 has a slope of 1.96 in excellent agreement with the theoretical value of 2 expected for a 2- to 1-electron couple. Decreasing the concentration of XO, and thus slowing the rate at which the reaction proceeds, had no effect on the potentials measured. In the case of Y223F, the potentials of both couples are identical to those of the wild-type enzyme, whereas the Y223S mutant has potentials each about 25 mV more positive than the wild type (Table I). This change in the Y223S potentials should have little influence on catalysis because the FAD midpoint potential of −103 mV makes enzyme reduction byd-alanine (rate-limiting for wild-type enzyme) slightly more thermodynamically favorable; retardation of the oxidative half-reaction is not an issue because the O2/H2O2 couple is so much more positive (+ 300 mV at pH 7) than the FAD/FADH2 couple. Y223F and Y223S mutations had no significant effect on the redox potentials of the enzyme-bound FAD. Dissociation constants for several ligands were measured in order to determine the contribution of residue Tyr-223 to substrate binding. In each case, binding was measured by the perturbation of the visible spectrum of the FAD upon formation of the bound complex (not shown), and with all the compounds tested and for both Y223F and Y223S mutants, the spectral modifications were identical to those observed for the binding to the wild-type DAAO. Only modest effects of 5–7-fold weakening in binding was observed for both mutants with the ligands CF3-alanine, benzoate and sulfite (Table II). CF3-alanine is not a substrate for the enzyme, as determined by anaerobic addition of the compound to the enzyme (not shown).Table IIBinding of aromatic and aliphatic competitive inhibitors, CF 3 -d-alanine, and sulfite to wild-type, Y223F, and Y223S d-amino acid oxidasesCompoundK dWild typeY223SY223FmmBenzoate0.95.06.4Anthranilate1.92.544Crotonate0.47.05.3CF3-d-alanine6.72936Sulfite0.120.660.85 Open table in a new tab The higher K d for sulfite parallels the results obtained with CF3-alanine and is somewhat surprising due to the modest changes in redox potentials of the mutants (see Table I). Binding of crotonate and anthranilate to the mutants was more substantially reduced (up to 23-fold higher K d for anthranilate observed with the Y223F-DAAO), but these compounds have little structural resemblance to amino acid substrates. Both mutants maintain the stereospecificity of the wild-type RgDAAO; they are not reduced by l-alanine and l-valine under anaerobic conditions. The ability of the Y223F and Y223S mutants to catalyze d-alanine/oxygen catalysis was measured by enzyme-monitored turnover. Air-saturated solutions of enzyme and ofd-alanine were mixed in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer, and the absorbance spectra were recorded continuously in the 350–650 nm wavelength range at 25 °C. Following the absorbance at 456 nm, an initial rapid decrease of the oxidized flavin absorption was observed, followed by a steady-state phase, and then by a further decrease to reach the final reduced state. This confirms that both the Y223F and Y223S mutants are competent catalysts (Fig. 3). With Y223F and Y223S mutants, as well as for the wild-type DAAO, the enzyme is largely present in the oxidized form during turnover. This indicates that the overall process of reoxidation of reduced DAAO with oxygen is faster than the reductive half-reaction. Although the steady-state phase is quite short, the Lineweaver-Burk plots of d-alanine/oxygen turnover (as well as with d-valine) show a set of converging lines with both DAAO mutants (shown only for Y223S with d-alanine,inset of Fig. 3), consistent with a ternary complex mechanism. For wild-type DAAO with d-alanine as substrate, a parallel line pattern in the secondary plots was instead found (5Pollegioni L. Langkau B. Tischer W. Ghisla S. Pilone M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13850-13857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with a limiting case of a ternary complex mechanism where some specific rate constants (i.e. k −2, the reverse of the reduction rate) are sufficiently small. For Y223F, k cat is only reduced by about one-third, and the K m ford-alanine and O2 are essentially unchanged. For Y223S, k cat is reduced about 80-fold,K m for d-alanine is increased 2-fold, and K m for oxygen is decreased 15-fold (Table III). The drastic change in kinetic parameters of Y223S with d-alanine was confirmed by studying the reaction of Y223S using d-valine as substrate (Table III).Table IIIComparison of the steady-state coefficients for wild-type, Y223F, and Y223S d-amino-acid oxidases with d-alanine andd-valine as substrates, at pH 8.5 and 25 °Cd-Alanined-Valinek cat (s−1)Wild typeaWild-type enzyme data are from Pollegioni et al.

https://openalex.org/W1963644001,"The human erythrocyte facilitative glucose transporter (Glut1) is predicted to contain 12 transmembrane spanning α-helices based upon hydropathy plot analysis of the primary sequence. Five of these helices (3, 5, 7, 8, and 11) are capable of forming amphipathic structures. A model of GLUT1 tertiary structure has therefore been proposed in which the hydrophilic faces of several amphipathic helices are arranged to form a central aqueous channel through which glucose traverses the hydrophobic lipid bilayer. In order to test this model, we individually mutated each of the amino acid residues in transmembrane segment 7 to cysteine in an engineered GLUT1 molecule devoid of all native cysteines (C-less). Measurement of 2-deoxyglucose uptake in a Xenopus oocyte expression system revealed that nearly all of these mutants retain measurable transport activity. Over one-half of the cysteine mutants had significantly reduced specific activity relative to the C-less protein. The solvent accessibility and relative orientation of the residues within the helix was investigated by determining the sensitivity of the mutant transporters to inhibition by the sulfhydryl directed reagentp-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate (pCMBS). Cysteine replacement at six positions (Gln282, Gln283, Ile287, Ala289, Val290, and Phe291), all near the exofacial side of the cell membrane, produced transporters that were inhibited by incubation with extracellular pCMBS. Residues predicted to be near the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane were minimally affected by pCMBS. These data demonstrate that the exofacial portion of transmembrane segment 7 is accessible to the external solvent and provide evidence for the positioning of this α-helix within the glucose permeation pathway."

F., Li, H., Zhang, H., Peterson, J. A., and Poulos, T. L. (1999)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 96, 1863–1868) indicates that the proximal side of the heme domain molecule is the docking site for the FMN domain and that the Pro382—Gln387peptide may provide an electron transfer (ET) path from the FMN to the heme iron. In order to evaluate whether ET complexes formed in solution by the heme and FMN domains are structurally relevant to that seen in the crystal structure, we utilized site-directed mutagenesis to introduce Cys residues at positions 104 and 387, which are sites of close contact between the domains in the crystal structure and at position 372 as a control. Cys residues were modified with a bulky sulfhydryl reagent, 1-dimethylaminonaphthalene-5-sulfonate-l-cystine (dansylcystine (DC)), to prevent the FMN domain from binding at the site seen in the crystal structure. The DC modification of Cys372 and Cys387 resulted in a 2-fold decrease in the rates of interdomain ET in the reconstituted system consisting of the separate heme and FMN domains and had no effect on heme reduction in the intact heme/FMN-binding fragment of P450BM-3. DC modification of Cys104 caused a 10–20-fold decrease in the interdomain ET reaction rate in both the reconstituted system and the intact heme/FMN domain.

Science. 1994; 264: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), has provided valuable structural information about the interacting surfaces, orientation of cofactors, and possible pathways for the electron flow. The x-ray crystal structure of 1:1 complexes between yeast CcP and yeast and horse cyt c has revealed that the crystallographic CcP·cyt c complex (1Pelletier H. Kraut J. Science. 1992; 258: 1748-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) differs significantly from the proposed model based on the complementarity of surface charges (4Poulos T.L. Kraut J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10322-10330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With only a few hydrogen bonds at the interface, hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions are the predominant forces holding the two proteins together. The functional relevance of the binding orientation observed in the crystal structure is supported by mutagenesis and kinetic and chemical modification studies (5Pappa H.S. Tajbaksh S. Saunders A.J.

A single crystal polarized absorption study on binary and ternary complexes of methylamine dehydrogenase with its redox partners demonstrated that both complexes are competent for substrate oxidation and ET (8Merli A.

Also it was shown that the orientation of methylamine dehydrogenase and amicyanin in the solution complex is the same as the one seen in the crystal structure (9Davidson V.L. Jones L.H. Graichen M.E. Mathews F.S. Hosler J.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12733-12738Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, amicyanin binding to cytochrome c 551i in solution appeared to occur at different sites when amicyanin is free or when it is in complex with methylamine dehydrogenase (10Davidson V.L.

Multidomain or multisubunit electron transferring proteins serve as examples of protein complexes where the interaction between partners is optimized by the covalent linkage of the domains. Several structures of multidomain electron transfer proteins are available (11Deisenhofer J. Epp O. Miki K. Huber R. Michel H. J. Mol.

Analysis of structural information on this enzyme has allowed the identification of structural elements and amino acid residues that are important in controlling ET from FMN to heme. The hinge region and one particular interface residue, Tyr143, were found to play an important role in modulation of interdomain ET (16Miles C.S. Rouviaere-Fourmy N. Lederer F. Mathews F.S. Reid G.A.

Flavocytochrome P450BM-3, a catalytically self-sufficient fatty acid monooxygenase from Bacillus megaterium (20Narhi L.O. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7160-7169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Ruettinger R.T. Wen L.P. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10987-10995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is an example of a multidomain protein in the superfamily of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Unlike other P450s, the heme domain of P450BM-3 is naturally fused with an FMN/FAD-containing reductase domain, which provides electrons required for P450 catalysis. Being a structural and functional analog to the microsomal P450s and P450 reductase, P450BM-3 is a very attractive model system for studying structure/function relationships and mechanism of ET in the P450-dependent monooxygenase system. Recombinant expression of functional domains of P450BM-3, including heme- (BMP), FMN/FAD-, FMN-, FAD-, and heme/FMN-binding fragments (22Li H.Y. Darwish K. Poulos T.L. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1997; 340: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), has provided simplified systems and facilitated studies on domain-domain interaction in this complex enzyme. Since the FMN is the site donating electrons to the heme of P450, the heme/FMN-binding domain (BMP/FMN) of P450BM-3 represents the simplest model for the electron transfer complex (28Hazzard J.T. Govindaraj S. Poulos T.L. Tollin G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7922-7926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The heme domain of P450BM-3 has been structurally characterized. Both substrate-free and substrate-bound x-ray structures are available (29Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasermann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar,30Li H. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Recent crystallographic studies on BMP/FMN have provided information about the structure of the FMN domain and defined the interaction site between the flavin and heme domains (31Sevrioukova I.F. Li H. Zhang H. Peterson J.A. Poulos T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1863-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Although the linkage between the two domains was proteolyzed during crystallization, the manner of domain-domain interaction was consistent with previous studies on P450s. Moreover, the precise positioning of the FMN toward the heme-binding loop led to the conclusion that the complex between the FMN and heme domains is specific and that the Pro382—Cys400 peptide of BMP can provide an electron pathway from the flavin to the heme iron. The present study is the first attempt to test the physiological relevance of the crystallographic complex. We have utilized laser flash photolysis techniques to examine the effect of chemical modification of specifically engineered cysteine residues of the heme domain of P450BM-3 on interdomain ET in both the reconstituted system consisting of the separate heme and FMN domains and intact BMP/FMN. The sterically bulky group of dansylcystine (DC) was covalently attached to the cysteines, which were introduced into the proximal side of the heme domain molecule to cause steric hindrance in the domain-domain interaction. The results indicate that the proximal side of the heme domain molecule in both separate BMP and intact BMP/FMN is the interaction site for the FMN domain and that the structure of the solution complex is consistent with that seen in the BMP/FMN crystal structure (31Sevrioukova I.F. Li H. Zhang H. Peterson J.A. Poulos T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1863-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Reagents for bacterial growth were purchased from Difco. pProEXTM HTb vector, rTEV protease, andPwo DNA polymerase were from Life Technologies, Inc. Restriction endonucleases and other modifying enzymes were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Didansyl-l-cystine was from Molecular Probes. The Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was obtained from Qiagen. Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The 6-histidine tag fused cytochrome P450BM-3 holoenzyme and its heme-, FMN-, and heme/FMN-binding domains were cloned by PCR using the pT7 BM3 as the template (32Darwish K. Li H.Y. Poulos T.L. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The 5′-oligonucleotide primers for the holoenzyme, the heme/FMN- and heme-binding domains were synthesized with an overhangingEcoRI restriction site, whereas the 5′-oligonucleotide for the FMN domain contained an overhanging EheI restriction site. The 3′-oligonucleotides for all fragments of P450BM-3 contained a stop codon followed by a KpnI restriction site. The PCR products were ligated to a pNEB vector (New England Biolabs), and the sequences were confirmed. After digestion of pNEB-BM3, pNEB-BMP, and pNEB-BMP/FMN with EcoRI and KpnI, and pNEB-FMN with EheI and KpnI, the DNA fragments containing coding regions of the desirable domains were ligated into uniqueEcoRI/KpnI and EheI/KpnI sites of the pProEXTM HTb vector, resulting in pProEX-BM3, pProEX-BMP, pProEx-BMP/FMN, and pProEX-FMN expression plasmids. Mutations were introduced into the heme domain coding region using the pProEX-BMP plasmid as a template for PCR. The 5′-oligonucleotide primers GGGAGACGATGTG TGC GAGTCCGTCCAG (E372C) and CCAAGTGCGATTCCG TGC CATGCGTTTAAACC (Q387C) together with 3′-nucleotide primer corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the heme domain, and 3′-oligonucleotide primers CTGAAGCTTGG ACA TAAGATATTATG (L104C) and GTTAAAGCC GCT AAGACCAATTGT (C156S) with the 5′-nucleotide primer corresponding to the amino terminus of the heme domain were used in the first PCR amplification (underlines indicate mutated codons). Synthesized 0.2–0.5-kilobase pair fragments served as 5′- or 3′-primers for the second PCR. The 1.4-kilobase pair fragments of DNA encoding the heme domain mutants were cloned into pNEB vector. Correct generation of desired mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The PinAI/PmeI fragments of pNEB-BMP plasmids containing the mutations were ligated intoPinAI/PmeI-digested expression plasmid pProEx-BMP. To build double mutants C156S/L104C, C156S/E372C, and C156S/Q387C of the heme domain of P450BM-3, theMunI/PstI fragment of pProEx-BMP(C156S) was exchanged with corresponding fragments of pProEx-BMP plasmids carrying single mutations. In order to introduce mutations into the holoenzyme of P450BM-3 and the heme/FMN-binding domain, thePinAI/PmeI fragments of pProEx-BM3 and pProEx-BMP/FMN were exchanged with corresponding fragments of pProEx-BMP carrying single and double mutants. Transformation, cell growth, and purification of the 6-histidine tag fused wild type (WT) and mutants of BMP, BMP/FMN, and P450BM-3 was performed as described previously for the 1–649 heme/FMN-containing fragment of P450BM-3 (27Sevrioukova I. Truan G. Peterson J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Sephacryl S-200HR was used for gel filtration of the holoenzyme of P450BM-3 as the last purification step. In final preparations of WT and mutants of BMP, BMP/FMN, and P450BM-3, A 418/280 was not less than 1.62, 1.03, and 0.68, respectively. The recombinant FMN domain of P450BM-3 was expressed and purified as described elsewhere (25Sevrioukova I. Truan G. Peterson J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7528-7535Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All UV-visible spectroscopy was performed using a Cary 3 spectrophotometer. P450 content was measured by the reduced CO difference spectrum (33Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of the FMN domain and the FMN content were determined as described previously (25Sevrioukova I. Truan G. Peterson J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7528-7535Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The concentration of didansyl-l-cystine (DDC) was measured spectrophotometrically using ε328 nm = 8.4 mm−1 cm−1. The rate of NADPH oxidation by P450BM-3 was measured at 25 °C by monitoring the absorbance change at 340 nm using ε = 6.22 mm−1 cm−1. Reactions were carried in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in the presence of 100 μm palmitic acid as described elsewhere (27Sevrioukova I. Truan G. Peterson J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cytc reductase activity was measured in 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer in the presence of 100 μm cytc employing ε550 nm = 21 mm−1 cm−1. Sulfhydryl-specific fluorescent labeling with DDC was carried out as described previously (34Daly T.J. Olson J.S. Matthews K.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5468-5474Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 35Wu C.W. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1104-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). After reduction of 100 μm solutions of the mutants of BMP or BMP/FMN in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, with 20 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) at 37 °C for 1.5 h, the excess of DTT was separated from the proteins by chromatography on Sephadex G-25 in the same buffer. A 40-fold excess of DDC was added to the proteins and incubated overnight at room temperature in the dark. Solutions were concentrated by ultrafiltration in a Centricon 50 (Amicon) and passed through a Sephadex G-25 column to remove unbound DDC. The fluorescence intensity was measured at 495 and 535 nm (excitation at 330 nm) for protein-bound and protein-free label, respectively, using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Fluorescence measurements were carried out in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.1m NaCl, at 25 °C. Laser flash photolysis experiments were performed anaerobically at room temperature as described elsewhere (18Tollin G. Hurley J.K. Hazzard J.T. Meyer T.E. Biophys. Chem. 1993; 48: 259-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Hazzard J.T. Govindaraj S. Poulos T.L. Tollin G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7922-7926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The technique involves the generation of a strong reductant, 5-deazariboflavin semiquinone (dRFH⋅),in situ through the excitation of 5-deazariboflavin (dRF) by a laser pulse, followed by rapid reduction of the protein heme or FMN by dRFH⋅. If a complex of redox partners is present in the solution and one partner is reduced preferentially, the rate of intermolecular ET can subsequently be followed spectroscopically. A 10 or 100 mm phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.4, contained 100 μm dRF and 2 mm semicarbazide as a sacrificial electron donor. The solutions (minus enzyme) were made anaerobic by bubbling for 1 h with either argon or CO/argon mixtures that had been passed through two 1.5 × 100-cm columns containing an oxygen removing catalyst (R3–11, Chemical Dynamics). The absence of oxygen was monitored by the amplitude and decay of the dRFH⋅ transient signal obtained at 500 nm upon laser excitation of the reaction prior to addition of the enzyme(s). In order to maintain anaerobiosis, all aliquots of added protein or substrate were subjected to a flow of the oxygen-free gas prior to mixing with the bulk reaction solution. The protein concentration was always larger than the concentration of dRFH⋅ generated by the laser flash, so that pseudo-first order conditions applied and no more than a single electron could enter each protein molecule. Transient kinetic data were collected using a Tektronix TDS 410A digitizing oscilloscope and analyzed on a personal computer using KINFIT (OLIS Co, Jefferson, GA). Fig. 1 represents the x-ray structure of the complex between the heme and FMN domains of P450BM-3 (31Sevrioukova I.F. Li H. Zhang H. Peterson J.A. Poulos T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1863-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Residues 479–630 of the flavin domain were found to be well defined in the structure and were thought to represent the core of the flavodoxin-like molecule. For this reason, in order to clone the FMN-containing fragment of the minimal length, Asn479 and Leu630 were chosen as the amino- and carboxyl-terminal residues to design primers for the PCR reaction. Surprisingly, the expression of the 479–630 construct was very low. A five amino acid extension of the carboxyl terminus to Ser635, however, resulted in a high expression of the properly folded 479–635 FMN domain, whose spectral and redox properties were similar to those of previously expressed proteins (25Sevrioukova I. Truan G. Peterson J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7528-7535Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Govindaraj S. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7915-7921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Ser635 also was chosen as the carboxyl-terminal residue for cloning and expression of the shorter 1–635 BMP/FMN domain of P450BM-3. Fourteen amino acid carboxyl-terminal truncation did not affect either spectral or substrate binding properties of BMP/FMN. Similar to the construct of Li and Poulos (36Li H. Poulos T.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1995; 51: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we chose Leu455 as the carboxyl-terminal residue to produce the 6-histidine tag fused 1–455 heme domain of P450BM-3. The heme domain of P450BM-3 contains three natural cysteines at positions 62, 156, and 400. Cys400 is the proximal ligand for the heme iron and is buried inside the molecule in the solvent-inaccessible hydrophobic heme pocket (29Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasermann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Cys62 is located close to the surface of the heme domain and has 8.62 Å2 and 0.96 Å2 solvent-accessible surfaces in BMP and BMP/FMN, respectively. However, Cys62 has never been found to interact with the heavy atoms during preparation of the heavy atom derivatives of the crystals of either the heme domain or BMP/FMN. 2H. Li and I. Sevrioukova, personal observations. In contrast, Cys156, whose solvent-accessible surfaces are equal to 2.3 Å2 and 1.7 Å2 in BMP and BMP/FMN, respectively, was found to be easily derivatized with mercury compounds during short time soaks of both BMP and BMP/FMN crystals. For this reason, the highly reactive cysteine 156 was replaced by serine in BMP, BMP/FMN, and the holoenzyme of P450BM-3. The C156S mutation did not affect the spectral and substrate binding properties and rates of NADPH oxidation and cyt c reduction by the holoenzyme (data are not shown). Therefore, C156S mutants can be considered as control proteins in the studies described below. Three single cysteines were introduced in the heme-binding domains of different constructs at positions 104, 372, and 387 to produce the double mutants C156S/L104C, C156S/E372C, and C156S/Q387C. In the x-ray structure (Fig. 1), residues Leu104 and Gln387were found to be at the interface between the heme and flavin domains of P450BM-3. Glu372, located on the side of the heme domain that does not contact the FMN domain, was replaced by cysteine as a control. The double mutants of BMP, BMP/FMN, and the holoenzyme of P450BM-3 incorporated heme and had UV-visible absorption spectra similar to those of the WT proteins. The addition of an excess of arachidonic acid to the mutated hemoproteins resulted in a near complete conversion of the heme iron to the high spin form. The NADPH oxidation and cytochrome c reduction activities of the double mutants of P450BM-3 were similar to those of the WT holoenzyme (data are not shown). Optimal conditions for sulfhydryl group modification were found by varying the molar ratio of DDC to protein and incubation time. Fluorescence spectra of free DC and DC-modified double mutants of BMP and BMP/FMN are shown in Fig. 2. Binding to the proteins was accompanied by an enhancement of the dansyl group fluorescence and a characteristic blue shift in the excitation from 535 to 495 nm. The 2-fold higher fluorescence yield of DC bound to BMP/FMN compared with that bound to BMP (Fig. 2 B) is indicative of a more hydrophobic environment of the fluorescent probe in the intact heme/FMN domain, most likely because of the presence of the covalently linked flavin domain. The specificity and stoichiometry of SH group modification were determined by addition of DTT to the labeled proteins. Loss of more than 85% of fluorescence within a few minutes due to bound DC upon DTT treatment (Fig. 2, spectra 5–7) indicates that fluorescent label binds specifically to the sulfhydryl groups of the proteins. The estimation of the fluorescence intensity of free DC released from the proteins after DTT reduction enabled us to determine the molar ratio of the fluorescent probe to protein, which was near stoichiometric and varied from 0.8 to 1.2 for many experiments with various mutants. To check the possibility of interaction of DDC with cysteine 62, C156S mutants of BMP and BMP/FMN were incubated with the label under the same conditions as the double mutants. There was partial labeling of Cys62 in both proteins (Fig. 2, spectra 4). Calculation of the amount of the released label after addition of DTT to C156S mutants of BMP and BMP/FMN showed that less than 15% of the cysteines reacted with DDC. DC-labeled C156S mutants were used as controls in all experiments. The sulfhydryl group modification did not affect the substrate binding properties of the proteins. The spectra of DC-labeled BMP/FMN mutants in the presence of arachidonic acid are shown in Fig. 3. The C156S/L104C BMP/FMN produced slightly smaller low to high spin conversion than other mutants. The dansylated preparations retained the dansyl group after a prolonged period. Illumination of a solution of dRF by a laser flash in the presence of semicarbazide as a sacrificial electron donor results in a rapid formation of a 1-electron reduced dRFH⋅ species that absorbs in the 450–550 nm region similar to other neutral flavin semiquinones (37Edmondson D.E. Barman B. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). dRFH⋅ is very unstable in solution and, in the absence of protein, is lost by both a self-recombination pathway producing the non-reactive dRF dimer and recombination with the oxidized radical of semicarbazide (38Pacheco A. Hazzard J.T. Tollin G. Enemark J.H. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 390-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the presence of an electron-accepting protein that can react with dRFH⋅, the absorption measured at different wavelengths decays below or above the preflash base line depending on the spectral properties of the species generated in solution. In our initial experiments, we have studied the reduction of the FMN domain by dRFH⋅. The reduced minus oxidized difference spectrum of the FMN domain is shown in Fig. 4. A minimum at 470 nm is indicative of bleaching of the flavin absorption upon reduction. A maximum at 380 nm and the absence of positive absorption in the 550–600 nm region are characteristic features of the formation of the red, anionic flavin semiquinone (39Massey V. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3181-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) via ET from dRFH⋅. The wavelengths of 380 and 475 nm were chosen to monitor the formation and disproportion of the anionic FMN semiquinone, FMN, and the extent of reduction of the flavin of the FMN domain, respectively. The plots ofk obs versus the FMN domain concentration for the FMN reduction by dRFH⋅ measured at pH 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0 versus the FMN domain concentration were similar and appeared to be hyperbolic suggesting that dRFH⋅forms a pre-reaction complex with the FMN domain (Fig. 5 A). A hyperbolic fit for all three data sets had a limiting value of 2.9 × 104s−1 for k obs at infinite [FMN domain] and a dissociation constant,"
https://openalex.org/W2084405730,"The keratinocyte growth factor (KGF or FGF-7) is unique among its family members both in its target cell specificity and its inhibition by the addition of heparin and the native heparan-sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), glypican-1 in cells expressing endogenous HSPGs. FGF-1, which binds the FGF-7 receptor with a similar affinity as FGF-7, is stimulated by both molecules. In the present study, we investigated the modulation of FGF-7 activities by heparin and glypican-1 in HS-free background utilizing either HS-deficient cells expressing the FGF-7 receptor (designated BaF/KGFR cells) or soluble extracellular domain of the receptor. At physiological concentrations of FGF-7, heparin was required for high affinity receptor binding and for signaling in BaF/KGFR cells. In contrast, binding of FGF-7 to the soluble form of the receptor did not require heparin. However, high concentrations of heparin inhibited the binding of FGF-7 to both the cell surface and the soluble receptor, similar to the reported effect of heparin in cells expressing endogenous HSPGs. The difference in heparin dependence for high affinity interaction between the cell surface and soluble receptor may be due to other molecule(s) present on cell surfaces. Glypican-1 differed from heparin in that it stimulated FGF-1 but not FGF-7 activities in BaF/KGFR cells. Glypican-1 abrogated the stimulatory effect of heparin, and heparin reversed the inhibitory effect of glypican-1, indicating that this HSPG inhibits FGF-7 activities by acting, most likely, as a competitive inhibitor of stimulatory HSPG species for FGF-7. The regulatory effect of glypican-1 is mediated at the level of interaction with the growth factor as glypican-1 did not bind the KGFR. The effect of heparin and glypican-1 on FGF-1 and FGF-7 oligomerization was studied employing high and physiological concentrations of growth factors. We did not find a correlation between the effects of these glycosaminoglycans on FGFs biological activity and oligomerization. Altogether, our findings argue against the heparin-linked dimer presentation model as key in FGFR activation, and support the notion that HSPGs primarily affect high affinity interaction of FGFs with their receptors. The keratinocyte growth factor (KGF or FGF-7) is unique among its family members both in its target cell specificity and its inhibition by the addition of heparin and the native heparan-sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), glypican-1 in cells expressing endogenous HSPGs. FGF-1, which binds the FGF-7 receptor with a similar affinity as FGF-7, is stimulated by both molecules. In the present study, we investigated the modulation of FGF-7 activities by heparin and glypican-1 in HS-free background utilizing either HS-deficient cells expressing the FGF-7 receptor (designated BaF/KGFR cells) or soluble extracellular domain of the receptor. At physiological concentrations of FGF-7, heparin was required for high affinity receptor binding and for signaling in BaF/KGFR cells. In contrast, binding of FGF-7 to the soluble form of the receptor did not require heparin. However, high concentrations of heparin inhibited the binding of FGF-7 to both the cell surface and the soluble receptor, similar to the reported effect of heparin in cells expressing endogenous HSPGs. The difference in heparin dependence for high affinity interaction between the cell surface and soluble receptor may be due to other molecule(s) present on cell surfaces. Glypican-1 differed from heparin in that it stimulated FGF-1 but not FGF-7 activities in BaF/KGFR cells. Glypican-1 abrogated the stimulatory effect of heparin, and heparin reversed the inhibitory effect of glypican-1, indicating that this HSPG inhibits FGF-7 activities by acting, most likely, as a competitive inhibitor of stimulatory HSPG species for FGF-7. The regulatory effect of glypican-1 is mediated at the level of interaction with the growth factor as glypican-1 did not bind the KGFR. The effect of heparin and glypican-1 on FGF-1 and FGF-7 oligomerization was studied employing high and physiological concentrations of growth factors.

Acidic-FGF (aFGF or FGF-1) and basic-FGF (bFGF or FGF-2) are the first isolated and best studied members of the FGF family (1Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv.

They act on a wide spectrum of tissues and cell types, and play important roles in a multitude of physiological and pathological processes including embryonal development, neuronal survival, angiogenesis, wound repair, and tumor growth (1Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). The keratinocyte growth factor (KGF or FGF-7) is unique among FGFs in its specificity toward cells of epithelial origin (3Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Chedid M. Miki T. Ron D. Cunha G.R. Finch P.W. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Epithelial-Mesenchimal Interactions in Cancer. Birkhauser Verlag Press, Basel, Switzerland1995: 191-214Google Scholar). FGF-7 is secreted by stromal cells and it stimulates the differentiation and proliferation of a large variety of epithelial cells, acting as a paracrine mediator of mesenchymal-epithelial communication (3Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Chedid M. Miki T. Ron D. Cunha G.R. Finch P.W. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Epithelial-Mesenchimal Interactions in Cancer.

FGF-7 is implicated in tissue development and repair, and in a number of pathological conditions such as prostate and breast cancer and inflammatory bowel disease (3Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Chedid M.

The biological activities of FGFs are mediated by four distinct but highly related cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors (designated FGFR1-FGFR4). FGF receptors (FGFRs) display overlapping ligand binding properties and alternative splicing mechanism generates receptor isoforms with altered ligand binding properties (2McKeehan W.L. Wang F.

FGF-1 interacts with the four FGFRs and the FGFR isoforms that have been characterized so far, whereas FGF-7 interacts only with an isoform of FGFR2 known as FGFR2IIIb form or the KGFR (8Dionne C.A.

The KGFR is expressed predominantly in cells of epithelial origin and it binds FGF-1 with an affinity similar to that observed for FGF-7 (14Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Ron D. Finch P.W. Florio C.

Beside interacting with FGFRs, FGFs bind to heparin and to heparan sulfate moieties of cell surface and extracellular matrix heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) (1Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar, 17Rapraeger A.C. Guimond S. Krufka A. Olwin B.B.

Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). HSPGs and heparin are potent modulators of FGF activity. They can protect FGFs from thermal denaturation and proteolytic degradation, and binding of FGF to extracellular matrix HSPGs provides a reservoir from which FGFs can be rapidly released in response to specific triggering events (19Saksela O.

Klagsbrun M. Fuks Z. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 638: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the absence of cell surface HSPGs, cellular responses to FGFs are attenuated but can be restored by the addition of heparin or HS, indicating that these GAGs can enhance FGF receptor binding and signaling (22Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar, 23Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Studies with FGF-2 and FGFR-1 suggested that heparin interacts with both the growth factor and its receptor to stimulate cellular responses to FGF (24Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 25Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This issue is controversial because different groups reported conflicting results (26Spivak-Kroizman T. Lemmon M.A. Dikic I.

Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Others suggested that interaction of FGFs with HSPGs increases their receptor binding affinity by stabilizing growth factor-receptor complexes (28Roghani M. Mansukhani A. Dell'Era P. Bellosta P.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8876-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). HSPGs and heparin may also facilitate FGFR dimerization and subsequent activation (26Spivak-Kroizman T. Lemmon M.A. Dikic I. Ladbury J.E. Pinchasi D. Huang J. Jaye M. Crumley G. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Cell. 1994; 79: 1015-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which HSPGs and heparin stimulate receptor dimerization is controversial. Two models were proposed. In the first, the signal transducing complex is composed of a 1:1 FGF/FGFR complexes cross-bridged via HS or heparin, giving rise to a 2:2 molar ratio of FGF to FGFR (26Spivak-Kroizman T.

The second model suggests that FGF induces receptor dimerization as a monomeric ligand and HSPGs stabilize the complex (30Pantoliano M.W. Horlick R.A. Springer B.A. Van Dyk D.E. Tobery T.

The modulation of ligand-receptor interaction by HS/heparin was mainly studied with FGFR1. Less is known about how these glycosaminoglycans modulate interaction of FGFs with other FGFRs. Previous studies revealed that heparin and the native HSPG glypican-1 are potent inhibitors of FGF-7 activities when added to cells that respond to FGF-7 and express endogenous HSPGs (32Ron D.

This inhibitory effect was intriguing because both enhanced the interaction of FGF-1 with the KGFR and FGFR1 (34Bonneh-Barkay D. Shlissel M. Berman B. Shaoul E. Admon A. Vlodavsky I. Carey D.J.

The present study was undertaken to further characterize the involvement of heparin and glypican-1 in FGF-7 and FGF-1 receptor binding and signaling by utilizing both heparan sulfate-deficient cells expressing the KGFR and soluble extracellular domain of the receptor. Human recombinant FGF-7 was produced in bacteria and purified as described previously (32Ron D. Bottaro D.P. Finch P.W. Morris D. Rubin J.S. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2984-2988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the preparation of heparin-free FGF-7 we utilized a hexahistidine-tagged FGF-7. The gene encoding human FGF-7 (residues Ala31 to Thr194) was cloned into plasmid pKM260 and expressed as His-tagged products inEscherichia coli (49Parks T.D. Leuther K.K. Howard E.D. Johnston S.A.

Expression of the recombinant proteins and preparation of the soluble fraction was performed as previously described (50Reich-Slotky R. Shaoul E. Berman B. Graziani G. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29813-29818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Purification was carried out by nickel nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography essentially as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). The receptor binding affinity and mitogenic activity of the His-tagged FGF-7 are identical to those of the parental molecule lacking the tag. The purification and the biological properties of the His-tagged FGF-7 are described elsewhere (37Gengrinovitch S. Berman B. David G. Witte L. Neufeld G. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10816-10822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Bovine brain FGF-1 was purchased from R & D Systems. Bovine lung-derived heparin was from Sigma. Heparin-Sepharose was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Carrier-free Na125I and [35S]Na2SO4 were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Microtiter ELISA plates were from Corning. Tissue culture media, sera, and cell culture supplements were from Biological Industries (Beth-hemeek, Israel) or from Life Technologies, Inc. Disuccinimidyl suberate was obtained from Pierce Chemical Co. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Rat myoblast cells (L6E9) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum as described previously (11Ron D. Reich R. Chedid M. Lengel C. Cohen O.E. Chan A.M. Neufeld G. Miki T. Tronick S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5388-5394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lymphocytic cell line BaF3 was grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 10% IL-3 conditioned medium from WEHI-3B cells (27Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% newborn calf serum. Cells were transfected by electroporation (960 microfarads, 240 V) with pCEV plasmid bearing the mouse KGFR gene (13Miki T. Fleming T.P. Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 251: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and selected with G418 (500 μg/ml) plus IL-3 conditioned medium. Mass cultures of resistant cells were then grown in the presence of FGF-1 (10 ng/ml) plus heparin (3 μg/ml) without IL-3. This process yielded mass cultures expressing significantly higher levels of KGFR (designated BaF/KGFR cells) compared with cells grown with G418 and IL-3 containing medium (data not shown). A cDNA fragment encoding the entire extracellular domain of the mouse KGFR (13Miki T. Fleming T.P. Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 251: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) was cloned into the APtag vector to produce an in-frame fusion of KGFR with secreted placental alkaline phosphatase (AP) (35Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). This plasmid was co-transfected with the selectable NeoR marker into NIH3T3 cells. Conditioned medium from G418-resistant colonies was screened for AP activity. The clone that produced the highest level of activity was expanded and used to purify the KGFR/AP fusion protein using FGF-1 affinity chromatography (34Bonneh-Barkay D. Shlissel M. Berman B. Shaoul E. Admon A. Vlodavsky I. Carey D.J. Asundi V.K. Reich-Slotky R. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12415-12421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Glypican-1 was purified from salt extracts of subconfluent L6E9 cultures. Affinity purification, estimation of HS content, and preparation of free glypican-1 HS were done as described previously (34Bonneh-Barkay D. Shlissel M. Berman B. Shaoul E. Admon A. Vlodavsky I.

The concentration of glypican-HS was normalized relative to known concentrations of heparin. Unless otherwise indicated, the experiments were performed with intact glypican-1. In a previous study we showed that intact glypican-1 or free HS derived from glypican-1 modulate similarly the activities of FGFs (34Bonneh-Barkay D. Shlissel M. Berman B. Shaoul E. Admon A.

Purified glypican-1 and FGFs were radioiodinated using chloramine T as described previously (11Ron D. Reich R. Chedid M. Lengel C. Cohen O.E. Chan A.M. Neufeld G. Miki T. Tronick S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5388-5394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled glypican-1 was separated from free iodine by chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, and radiolabeled FGFs were purified by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography (36Yuen S. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Specific activities of iodinated FGFs were in the range of 1–2.5 × 105cpm/ng, and for glypican-1, 6–12 × 106 cpm/μg of HS. FGF binding to BaF3/KGFR cells were performed essentially as described (11Ron D. Reich R. Chedid M. Lengel C. Cohen O.E. Chan A.M. Neufeld G. Miki T. Tronick S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5388-5394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that the assay was performed in suspension. Briefly, 2.4 × 106BaF/KGFR cells in 0.4 ml of binding buffer were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in the presence of 8 ng/ml radioiodinated growth factors. Determination of specific binding and cross-linking were done as described previously (11Ron D. Reich R. Chedid M. Lengel C. Cohen O.E. Chan A.M. Neufeld G. Miki T. Tronick S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5388-5394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand-receptor complexes were resolved on 6% SDS-PAGE. Equal amounts of total cell lysates were loaded onto each lane. Solid phase binding assays were performed in 96-well ELISA dishes as recently described (37Gengrinovitch S. Berman B. David G. Witte L. Neufeld G. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10816-10822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). For binding of125I-glypican-1 to FGF-7, 0.2 μg of FGF-7 in coating buffer was adsorbed to each well. For binding of radioiodinated FGF-1, FGF-7, or glypican-1 to KGFR/AP, wells were first coated with a monoclonal antibody against alkaline phosphatase, then conditioned medium from NIH3T3 cells expressing KGFR/AP (0.15 AP OD units/min) was added to antibody-coated wells. Specific binding was determined by subtracting counts/min of samples incubated with 1 μg/ml unlabeled ligand from the counts/min bound in the absence of unlabeled ligand. Negative controls included wells coated with bovine serum albumin alone, without AP antibody or KGFR/AP. Nonspecific binding was less than 10% of the total binding. Cross-linking experiments in solution were performed with 2 ng/ml radioiodinated FGF-7 or FGF-1 using affinity purified KGFR/AP, as described (34Bonneh-Barkay D. Shlissel M. Berman B. Shaoul E.

Mitogenic assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates. BaF/KGFR cells were seeded at 2 × 104cells/well in RPMI plus 10% fetal calf serum and the desired concentrations of growth factors, heparin, or glypican-1. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was assayed as described previously (34Bonneh-Barkay D. Shlissel M. Berman B. Shaoul E. Admon A. Vlodavsky I. Carey D.J. Asundi V.K. Reich-Slotky R. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12415-12421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For proliferation assays, the cells were seeded into 24-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well). Fresh growth factor and heparin were added every other day and viable cells were counted on day 5 after seeding. Each data point was performed in duplicates or triplicates and each experiment was repeated at least 3 times. The variation between different experiments did not exceed 10%. Each reaction contained either a mixture of radiolabeled and unlabeled growth factor or radiolabeled growth factor alone (see text), and increasing concentrations of glypican-1 or heparin. The binding and cross-linking experiments were carried out in a volume of 20 μl essentially as described by Ornitzet al. (27Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Samples were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and cross-linked FGFs were visualized by autoradiography. Previous studies showed that heparin and cell surface HSPGs differentially modulate the activity of FGF-1 and FGF-7, enhancing the activity of FGF-1 but inhibiting that of FGF-7 (34Bonneh-Barkay D. Shlissel M. Berman B. Shaoul E. Admon A. Vlodavsky I. Carey D.J. Asundi V.K. Reich-Slotky R. Ron D. J. Biol.

To further investigate this differential effect of HSPGs on FGF-1 and FGF-7 receptor binding and activation, and to determine whether heparin can stimulate the activities of FGF-7 we ectopically expressed the KGFR in BaF3 cells (designated BaF/KGFR cells). BaF3 cells do not express HSPGs and FGFRs and therefore provide a useful model system to study effects of heparin-like molecules (17Rapraeger A.C. Guimond S. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 27Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). We then compared the effect of heparin on receptor binding and mitogenic activity of FGF-7 and FGF-1 over a wide range of heparin concentrations (0.05–100 μg/ml). Binding of the radioiodinated ligands to the KGFR was evaluated by covalent cross-linking. As shown in Fig. 1, heparin at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 10 μg/ml dramatically enhanced the binding of both FGF-1 and FGF-7 to the KGFR. Binding of FGF-1 reached a maximal level at 1 μg/ml heparin (Fig. 1 A). Quantitation of the intensity of radioactivity in each band, in several different experiments, revealed that 1 μg/ml heparin increases specific binding of FGF-1 by 12–15-fold compared with the binding in the absence of heparin. Binding of 125I-FGF-7 to KGFR reached a maximal level (about 12-fold increase) at 10 μg/ml (Fig. 1 B). Higher concentrations of heparin differentially affected binding of each ligand to the KGFR, stimulating that of FGF-1 but strongly inhibiting that of FGF-7. Similar results were obtained using several different preparations of commercial heparin (data not shown). In addition, the effect of heparin on the mitogenic activity of each growth factor correlated very well with the observed effects on receptor binding (Fig. 1 C). The results presented in Fig. 1 showed that at low concentration and in the absence of heparin, FGF-7 did not stimulate a mitogenic response in BaF/KGFR cells. To further characterize the effect of heparin, we examined whether higher concentrations of FGF-7 can stimulate cell proliferation in the absence of heparin, utilizing FGF-7 preparation that was not exposed to heparin-Sepharose (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 51Sher I. Weizman A. Lubinsky-Mink S. Lang T. Adir N. Schomburg D. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35016-35022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The assay was performed with increasing concentrations of FGF-7 (5–1000 ng/ml) and in the absence or presence of 1 μg/ml heparin. Physiological concentrations of FGF-7 had little or no effect on cell proliferation in the absence of heparin. By contrast, added heparin supported proliferation to a level equivalent to that observed with IL-3 (Fig. 2). In the absence of heparin, cells were capable of responding to FGF-7 to a similar maximal extent, but significantly higher concentrations of growth factor were required. These findings suggest that although FGF-7 can stimulate cell proliferation in the absence of heparin, heparin is required to enhance the efficacy of the growth factor. Because glypican-1 and heparin exert a similar inhibitory effect on FGF-7 activities in cells that naturally express KGFR and HSPGs, we investigated whether glypican-1 can also stimulate the activities of FGF-7 in BaF/KGFR cells. Glypican-1, failed to enhance the binding of125I-FGF-7 to the KGFR over a wide concentration range (0.01- 25 μg/ml) (Fig. 3 A, bottom, and data not shown). Similarly, glypican-1 did not enhance the mitogenic activity of FGF-7 in BaF/KGFR cells (Fig. 3 B). To ensure that glypican-1 is biologically active we tested its effect on receptor binding and mitogenic activity of FGF-1, as glypican-1 had a stimulatory effect on FGF-1 activities (34Bonneh-Barkay D. Shlissel M. Berman B. Shaoul E. Admon A. Vlodavsky I. Carey D.J. Asundi V.K. Reich-Slotky R. Ron D. J. Biol.

Glypican-1 enhanced the binding of FGF-1 to KGFR in all the concentrations that were tested (0.1–25 μg/ml). An 8-fold increase in specific binding of FGF-1 was observed in the presence of 10 μg/ml glypican-1 compared with FGF-1 binding in the absence of glypican-1 (Fig. 3 A, top). Similarly, glypican-1 enhanced the mitogenic activity of FGF-1 (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that the failure of glypican-1 to enhance FGF-7 activities is an intrinsic property of this HSPG and point to an important difference between the effect of glypi"

SCaM-1 is a plant calmodulin (CaM) isoform that is 91% identical to mammalian CaM (wild type CaM (wtCaM)) and a selective competitive antagonist of NOS (Cho, M. J., Vaghy, P. L., Kondo, R., Lee, S. H., Davis, J. P., Rehl, R., Heo, W. D., and Johnson, J. D. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 15593–15597). We have used site-directed mutagenesis to show that a point mutation, involving the substitution of valine for methionine at position 144, is responsible for SCaM-1's inhibition of mammalian NOS. An M144V mutation in wild type CaM produced a mutant (M144V) which exhibited nearly identical inhibition of NOS's NO production and NADPH oxidation, with a similar K i (∼15 nm) as SCaM-1. A V144M back mutation in SCaM-1 significantly restored its ability to activate NOS's catalytic functions. The length of the hydrophobic amino acid side chain at position 144 appears to be critical for NOS activation, since M144L and M144F activated NOS while M144V and M144C did not. Despite their competitive antagonism of NOS, M144V, like SCaM-1, exhibited a similar dose-dependent activation of phosphodiesterase and calcineurin as wtCaM. SCaM-1 and M144V produced greater inhibition of NOS's oxygenase domain function (NO production) than its reductase domain functions (NADPH oxidation and cytochrome c reduction). Thus, CaM's methionine 144 plays a critical role the activation of NOS, presumably by influencing the function of NOS's oxygenase domain.

Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar). Calmodulin (CaM)1 is a ubiquitous Ca2+-binding protein that serves as a primary mediator of the Ca2+ signal (see Ref. 2Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar for review). Calcium binding to CaM allows it to bind and activate more than 30 target enzymes, resulting in alterations in numerous second messengers and in cell function. CaM activates NOS in both plant and animal cells and NOS activation results in the production of the gaseous second messenger molecule NO. NO plays a key regulatory role in smooth muscle contraction-relaxation, neurotransmission, immune response, and plant cell growth and defense (3McDonald L.J. Murad F. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

Three NOS isoforms have been identified in different tissue: neuronal NOS, endothelial NOS, and inducible NOS (7Marletta M.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 927-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Each isoform has an N-terminal heme-containing oxygenase domain, a CaM binding domain, and a C-terminal flavin-containing reductase domain. While both nNOS and eNOS require the Ca2+-dependent binding of CaM for activation, iNOS is fully active at low [Ca2+], because of a tightly bound CaM (8Cho H.J. Xie Q. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swidered K.M. Lee T.D. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). CaM's activation of NOS appears to be more complex than its activation of other target enzymes, which often require the simple removal of a pseudosubstrate inhibitory domain from their active sites (9Su Z.

CaM binds nNOS at amino acids 725–754, between its N-terminal oxygenase domain and its C-terminal reductase domain (11Zhang M. Vogel H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). CaM facilitates electron transfer at two points in NOS: 1) from NADPH to the flavins within the reductase domain and 2) from the flavins in the reductase domain to the heme in the oxygenase domain or to exogenous electron acceptors such as the heme of cytochrome c (13Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once electrons are received in the N-terminal oxygenase domain they are used for the conversion of l-Arg to citrulline and NO. The functional unit of NOS is a dimer (see Ref. 14Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 339-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), and recent studies have suggested that CaM binding to inducible NOS serves to bring the flavin binding reductase domain of one monomer into close proximity with the heme binding oxygenase domain of the other monomer for optimal intermolecular electron transfer (15Siddhanta U. Presta A. Fan B. Wolan D. Rousseau D.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18950-18958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which CaM facilitates NOS's intra- or intermolecular electron transfer to facilitate NO production is currently unknown. We have recently cloned five CaM isoforms from soybean (SCaM-1 through SCaM-5) and showed that one of these isoforms, SCaM-1, was a potent and selective competitive antagonist of skeletal muscle NOS (16Cho M.J. Vaghy P.L. Kondo R. Lee S.H. Davis J.P. Rehl R. Heo W.D. Johnson J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15593-15597Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although SCaM-1 is a competitive antagonist of NOS, it activates other CaM-dependent enzymes (including PDE, NAD-kinase, CaN) as effectively as wtCaM. Fig. 1 compares the amino acid sequence of wtCaM and SCaM-1. SCaM-1 is 91% identical to wtCaM, exhibiting only 14 different amino acids, 7 of which are nonconservative substitutions. This protein provides a unique opportunity for understanding the mechanism by which nature has designed a selective competitive antagonist of NOS. In this paper we show that the amino acid Val-144 is responsible for SCaM-1's competitive inhibition of NOS. We discuss the implications of this finding on the mechanism of CaM activation of NOS. Soybean CaMs and their chimeras were cloned, expressed, and purified as described previously (17Lee S.H. Kim J.C. Lee M.S. Heo W.D. Seo H.Y. Yoon H.W. Hong J.C. Lee S.Y. Bahk J.D. Hwang I. Cho M.J.

The mutants (M144V, Q143K/M144V/T146M, and S1V144M) were constructed from the wild type CaM or SCaM-1 cDNA using primer based site-directed mutagenesis following the protocol provided by Stratagene's (La Jolla, CA) QuikChange™ Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit. DNA sequence analysis confirmed the correct generation of each mutant. CaM concentrations were determined by amino acid composition. Recombinant neuronal NOS was purchased from Alexis Biochemical Corp. (San Diego, CA). It had a specific activity of 68.2 nmol/min/mg for NADPH oxidation, 600 nmol/min/mg for cytochrome c reduction, and to 35.7 nmol/min/mg for NO synthesis when maximally stimulated by wtCaM. A >95% pure recombinant NOS (764 units/mg) was purchased from Calbiochemical Corp. NOS activities were measured by the NADPH oxidation, oxyhemoglobin, and cytochrome c reduction assays. The NADPH oxidation assay was performed as described previously (16Cho M.J. Vaghy P.L. Kondo R. Lee S.H. Davis J.P. Rehl R. Heo W.D. Johnson J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15593-15597Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,18Stuehr D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 324-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Each assay mixture contained 3 mm 1,4-dithio-dl-threitol, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mml-Arg, 4 μm of FAD, FMN, and H4B, 10 units/ml catalase, 100 μm NADPH, in 1 ml of 50 mmHEPES at pH 7.5 and 37 °C. Assays were initiated by addition of 26 μg of NOS to obtain the basal activity, followed by addition of wtCaM, SCaM-1, or their mutants. The decrease in NADPH absorbance was monitored at 340 nm as a function of time, using ε = 6.22 mm−1 cm−1. For the double-reciprocal plots in the presence of inhibitors, assays were initiated with NOS in the presence of both wtCaM and the inhibitor. Oxyhemoglobin assays were performed as described previously (18Stuehr D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 324-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each assay mixture contained 6 μm oxyhemoglobin, 0.3 mm 1,4-dithio-dl-threitol, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mml-Arg, 4 μm each of FAD, FMN, and H4B, 100 units/ml catalase, 10 units/ml superoxide dismutase, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μm NADPH, in 1 ml of 50 mm HEPES at pH 7.5 and 37 °C. The reactions were initiated by addition of 37 μg of NOS to obtain basal activity followed by the addition of 1 μm wtCaM, SCaM-1, or their mutants. The increase in absorbance at 401 nm was monitored as a function of time using Δε = 38 mm−1 cm−1. Cytochrome c reduction assay was performed as described previously (19Richards M.K. Claque M.J. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7772-7780Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with modifications. Each assay mixture contained 1 mm CaCl2, 50 μm cytochromec, 100 μm NADPH, 7.3 μg of NOS, in 1 ml of 50 mm HEPES at pH 7.5 and 37 °C. Assays were initiated with NADPH and after a basal rate was established, 1 μmof wtCaM, SCaM-1, or their mutants were added. The increase in absorbance was monitored at 550 nm, using Δε = 21 mm−1 cm−1. PDE and CaN were purified and assayed as described previously (16Cho M.J. Vaghy P.L. Kondo R. Lee S.H. Davis J.P. Rehl R.

Biochem. 1987; 162: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Since SCaM-1 has only 14 amino acids that are different from those in wtCaM (see Fig. 1), we mutated wtCaM so that it would have some of the nonconservative mutations found in SCaM-1 and determined the effect of these mutants on NOS activation. We made a T70N/M71L mutation in the second EF-hand of wtCaM and a I85L/R86K mutation in the third EF-hand of wtCaM. This mutant (T70N/M71L/I85L/R86K) exhibited normal activation of NOS's NADPH oxidation (data not shown). We next mutated wtCaM so that it contained three amino acids that are found in helix 8 of SCaM-1's fourth EF-hand. This mutant (Q143K/M144V/T146M) exhibited impaired activation of NOS. Fig. 2 shows the dose-dependent activation of NOS's NADPH oxidation by wtCaM, Q143K/M144V/T146M, and SCaM-1. WtCaM half-maximally activated NOS at 3.2 nm. The Q143K/M144V/T146M mutant and SCaM-1 both activated NOS's NADPH oxidation to about 25% of the level produced by wtCaM with a similar dose dependence (half-maximal activation at 4.6 and 4.4 nm, respectively). Fig. 2 also shows that the point mutation, M144V in wtCaM, produced a mutant that activates NOS to only 24% of the level produced by wtCaM and that this activation was half-maximal at 6.4 nm. Thus, this point mutation in wtCaM produces a mutant that acts essentially identical to SCaM-1 with respect to activation of NOS's NADPH oxidation. To determine whether M144V, like SCaM-1, is a competitive antagonist of wtCaM activation of NOS, we examined wtCaM activation of NOS in the absence and presence of each inhibitor (M144V and SCaM-1). Fig. 3 shows a double-reciprocal plot of wtCaM activation of NOS's NADPH oxidation in the absence and in the presence of 58 and 117 nm M144V. The presence of M144V increases the slope of the double-reciprocal plot without altering the intercept on the 1/v axis. Thus, M144V is a potent competitive antagonist of NOS with a K i of 15 nm. Nearly identical results were found for SCaM-1, and it competitively inhibited wtCaM activation of NOS with aK i of 17 nm (data not shown). Thus, an M144V point mutation in wtCaM makes it a competitive antagonists of NOS with a similar K i as SCaM-1. We have previously shown that SCaM-1 is a competitive antagonist of skeletal muscle NOS's production of NO (16Cho M.J. Vaghy P.L. Kondo R. Lee S.H. Davis J.P. Rehl R. Heo W.D. Johnson J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15593-15597Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We determined the effectiveness of M144V in activating NO production. Fig. 4 shows the dose-dependent activation of NO production by wtCaM, SCaM-1, and M144V. Although wtCaM half-maximally activated NOS's NO production at 3.5 nm, neither SCaM-1 nor M144V produced any significant activation of NOS. Essentially identical results were obtained when these experiments were conducted using a 6.6 nm amount (1.05 μg/ml) of a highly purified (>95% pure, specific activity 764 units/mg) recombinant NOS. With B-CaM half-maximal activation occurred at ∼2 nm, and M144V produced no activation of NO production even at 1 μmconcentration. Thus, the M144V mutation in SCaM-1 is responsible for its inactivation of NOS's NO production and NADPH oxidation. To further confirm that Val-144 is primarily responsible for SCaM-1's competitive antagonism of NOS we used site-directed mutagenesis to produce a V144M back mutation in SCaM-1 (S1V144M). Fig. 4 also shows the dose dependent activation of NOS's NO production by the S1V144M mutant. S1V144M produced ∼57% activation with aK act of 15.4 nm. Clearly, the V144M mutation in SCaM-1 makes it a much more effective activator of NOS. These studies point out the importance of methionine at position 144 for CaM activation of NOS. When CaM has a methionine residue at position 144 it activates NOS, but when it has a valine at this position it competitively inhibits NOS. To better understand the mechanism by which the amino acid at position 144 affects NOS activation, we used site-directed mutagenesis to place other amino acids at position 144. Fig. 5shows the effect of 1 μm wtCaM, M144V, M144L, M144C, and M144F on NOS NO synthesis. The M144L and M144F mutants exhibited similar (104 ± 6% and 85 ± 5%, respectively) activation as wtCaM. The M144C mutant exhibited little NOS activation (19 ± 2%). Thus, lengthening the side chain of valine by one methylene group produces a mutant (M144L) that activates as effectively as wtCaM. A sulfur group at position 144 is neither required nor sufficient for NOS activation. In addition, placement of the longer and more hydrophobic F at position 144 results in NOS activation. These results suggest that M144V probably fails to activate NOS, because its side chain may not be long enough to interact with a critical region of NOS. Although SCaM-1 was a competitive antagonist of NOS, we have previously shown that it exhibits full activation of other CaM target enzymes, including PDE, CaN, and NAD-kinase (16Cho M.J. Vaghy P.L. Kondo R. Lee S.H. Davis J.P. Rehl R. Heo W.D. Johnson J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15593-15597Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17Lee S.H. Kim J.C. Lee M.S. Heo W.D. Seo H.Y. Yoon H.W.

Similarly, M144V exhibited a normal dose-dependent activation of PDE and CaN (data not shown). Half-maximal activation of PDE was observed at 13 nm wtCaM and at 18 nm M144V. Half-maximal activation of CaN was observed at 14 nm wtCaM and at 21 nm M144V. Thus, methionine at position 144 in wtCaM may have a specific role in the activation of NOS. Our studies of SCaM-1 and M144V activation of NOS's NADPH oxidation and NO production show that valine at position 144 completely inhibits NOS's NO production, while it reduces NOS's NADPH oxidation to ∼25% of that observed with wtCaM. Fig. 6 compares the ability of wtCaM, M144V, SCaM-1, and S1V144M to stimulate NOS's NADPH oxidation, cytochromec reduction, and NO synthesis. WtCaM stimulated all three activities 100% (control). M144V stimulated NADPH oxidation to 24 ± 2%, cytochrome c reduction to 72 ± 2% and NO synthesis to only 3.5 ± 2.2% of control (wtCaM) values. M144V produced similar percent activation of each of these NOS activities when a >95% pure NOS was used. SCaM-1 produced similar results as M144V on the oxygenase domain-dependent functions of NOS, stimulating NADPH oxidation to 25 ± 1.7% and NO synthesis to only 1.8 ± 1.1% of control values. Thus, the M144V point mutation produces virtually all of the impaired activation of NOS's oxygenase domain-dependent functions (NADPH oxidation and NO production) exhibited by SCaM-1. NOS's reductase domain-specific function (cytochrome c reduction) was more impaired with SCaM-1 (39 ± 2.9%) than with M144V (72 ± 2%). Mutations in SCaM-1, other than M144V, must be affecting its activation of cytochrome c reduction. The V144M back mutation in SCaM-1 markedly restored each NOS activity. S1V144M stimulated NADPH oxidation to 65 ± 4.1%, cytochromec reduction to 70 ± 4% and NO synthesis to 58 ± 6.3% of control values. Thus, Met-144 in CaM plays a critical role in it's activation of NOS's NADPH oxidation and NO production and a less important role in activation of NOS's reductase domain reduction of cytochrome c. We have previously shown that SCaM-1 is a competitive antagonist of skeletal muscle NOS (nNOSμ) with a K i of ∼120 nm (16Cho M.J. Vaghy P.L. Kondo R. Lee S.H. Davis J.P. Rehl R. Heo W.D. Johnson J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15593-15597Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The present studies show that SCaM-1 is an even more effective competitive antagonist of recombinant neuronal NOS exhibiting a K i of ∼17 nm. TheK act that we determined for wtCaM activation of nNOS (3.2 nm) is in excellent agreement with previously reported values of 2–4 nm (9Su Z. Blazing M.A. Fan D. George S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29117-29122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 10Stevens-Truss R. Beckingham K. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12337-12345Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The ∼10-fold higher apparent affinity of wtCaM and SCaM-1 for nNOS than nNOSμ could result from the additional 34 amino acids near nNOSμ CaM binding site (21Silvagno F. Xia H. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11204-11208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), or it could be a consequence of the lower specific activity of the skeletal muscle isoform relative to the more purified nNOS recombinant isoform used in this study. Clearly, SCaM-1 is a powerful competitive antagonist of both NOS isoforms. Our results indicate that the M144V point mutation is primarily responsible for SCaM-1's selective competitive antagonism of mammalian NOS. An M144V point mutation in wtCaM produced a mutant that failed to activate and served as a competitive antagonist of NOS with aK i (∼15 nm) similar to SCaM-1. Furthermore, the V144M back mutation in SCaM-1 greatly enhanced its activation of NOS's NO production. The M144V mutation had little effect on CaM's affinity for NOS, since both SCaM-1 and M144V bind with similar affinity as wtCaM, but fail to activate NOS. Clearly, Met-144 must play a pivotal role in CaM's ability to control electron flow and regulate NOS's production of NO. Currently we do not know why the amino acid at position 144 is so critical to NOS activation. The fact that M144V does not activate, while M144L does activate, indicates that the length of the side chain at postion 144 is critical to NOS activation. Consistent with this finding the M144F mutant that places the longer more hydrophobic phenylalanine residue at this position activates NOS. Clearly, the sulfur group is neither necessary nor sufficient for NOS activation because M144C fails to activate. Perhaps methionine's flexible unbranched side chain allows it to make a specific contact with a some key regulatory residues in the oxygenase domain of NOS. These interactions must still occur in mutants like M144L and M144F and probably result from some specific hydrophobic interactions of the amino acid at postion 144 of CaM with particular amino acids residues of NOS. X-ray studies of CaM-peptide complexes suggest that CaM's Met-144 makes a critical contact with a tryptophan residue in smooth muscle MLCK (22Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of the CaM binding sequence of smooth and skeletal muscle MLCK with NOS, suggest that Met-144 of CaM would interact with Phe-731 in nNOS (11Zhang M. Vogel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 981-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Roads A.R. Friedman J.E. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that a critical hydrophobic interactions between M144 of CaM and F731 of NOS are important in CaM activation of NOS's heme domain function and NO production. It has been suggested that CaM may interact with regions of nNOS and iNOS other than its canonical CaM binding sequence to produce enzyme activation (9Su Z. Blazing M.A. Fan D. George S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29117-29122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 10Stevens-Truss R. Beckingham K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27430-27437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). If this is the case, then it may be difficult to speculate as to which specific residue(s) of NOS interact with M144 of CaM to produce NOS activation and NO production. Many manmade CaM mutants have been shown to exhibit altered activation of NOS. Su et al. (9Su Z. Blazing M.A. Fan D. George S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29117-29122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) have replaced the individual EF-hands (or their subdomains) of CaM with the corresponding EF-hand of cardiac TnC to show that the latch domain comprised of helix 2 in site 1 and helix 6 in site 3 is critical for NOS activation. Replacing CaM's first EF-hand with TnC's first EF-hand produced a mutant (CaM (1 TnC)) that functioned as a potent competitive antagonist of NOS and smooth muscle MLCK (9Su Z. Blazing M.A. Fan D. George S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29117-29122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Persechini et al. (25Persechini A. Stemmer P.M. Ohashi I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32217-32225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) have interchanged CaM's first and third or second and fourth EF-hand to probe which functional determinants might affect the activation of smooth and skeletal MLCK and NOS. They found that when the first EF-hand was replaced with the third EF-hand, NOS activation was reduced by ∼55%, and smooth muscle MLCK activation was totally inhibited. These results suggest that the first EF-hand of CaM may have specific determinants that are required for NOS and smooth muscle MLCK activation. Furthermore, while replacement of CaM's fourth EF-hand with the second EF-hand (which has a Met corresponding to Met-144) had little effect on NOS activation, it reduced activation of skeletal muscle MLCK by 60% (25Persechini A. Stemmer P.M. Ohashi I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32217-32225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Stevens-Truss et al. (10Stevens-Truss R. Beckingham K. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12337-12345Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have used CaM mutants with mutations in each EF-hand to show that some of the EF-hand Ca2+ binding sites of CaM play a more important role in regulating NOS oxygenase domain dependent functions than reductase domain-specific functions. Mutation of CaM's first EF-hand (site 1) had equally devastating effects on NOS's oxidation of NADPH, reduction of cytochrome c, and formation of citrulline. Mutation of Ca2+ binding site 3 had little effect on any NOS activity. Site 2 or 4 mutations inhibited NOS activity by affecting N-terminal heme-dependent activities more than the heme-independent reductase domain activity of cytochrome c reduction. These studies suggest that site 2 and 4 play a more important role in regulating NOS's heme domain. They proposed a model where CaM's C-terminal contacts NOS's oxygenase domain and CaM's N-terminal contacts the reductase domain. Gachhui et al. (26Gachhui R. Abu-Soud H.M. Ghosha D.K. Presta A. Blazing M.A. Mayer B. George S.E. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5451-5454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have used CaM-TnC chimeras to show that the first, third, and fourth EF-hand of CaM are important in regulating NOS's heme domain function. For example, replacing the fourth EF-hand of CaM with the fourth EF-hand of TnC produced a mutant, CaM 4TnC, which exhibited ∼60% maximal activation of NOS's reduction of cytochrome c and only 13% maximal activation of NO synthesis. This is similar to our M144V mutant, which exhibits 72% maximal activation of NOS's cytochromec reduction and less than 4% maximal activation of NO synthesis. The above studies suggest that many regions and EF-hands of CaM are important for its activation of NOS. Our studies are consistent with the above studies because they implicate the fourth EF-hand of CaM in the regulation of NOS's heme domain function. Our studies extend the finding that the fourth EF-hand is important by showing that a particular amino acid, methionine at position 144, plays a critical role in facilitating electron transfer to the heme in the oxygenase domain of NOS and/or its production of NO from l-Arg. While the M144V mutation has its most dramatic inhibitory effects on the oxygenase domain of NOS, it also produces a small (28%) decrease in cytochrome c reduction. Although M144V and SCaM-1 inhibit NOS, they exhibit normal activation of PDE and CaN. Consistent with this observation Edwards et al. (27Edwards R.A. Walsh M.P. Sutherland C. Vogel H.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and Chin and Means (28Chin D. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30465-30471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that a M144L mutation and a M144Q mutation in CaM had little effect on the activation of CaN and smooth muscle MLCK. Thus, while the amino acid at CaM's position 144 plays a critical role in NOS activation, it may have little effect on the activation of numerous other target enzymes. Consistent with this concept, we have examined SCaM-1 for its ability to activate eight target enzymes, including phosphodiesterase, calcineurin, MLCK, red cell and plant Ca-ATPases, CaM kinase II, NAD kinase and plant glutamate decarboxylase. SCaM-1 activates each of these enzymes as effectively as mammalian CaM. Of all the enzymes examined, NOS is the only enzyme that is competitively inhibited by SCaM-1. A manuscript describing SCaM-1 and SCaM-4's activation of these other enzymes has just been submitted for publication. 2S. H. Lee, J. D. Johnson, M. P. Walsh, J. E. Van Lierop, C. Sutherland, A. Xu, W. A. Snedden, D. Kosk-Kosicka, H. Fromm, M. Naraynan, and M. J. Cho, submitted for publication. SCaM-1 and M144V are different from any of the manmade competitive antagonists of NOS because they use different amino acid substitutions, and only SCaM-1 and M144V are selective competitive antagonists of NOS. This feature of SCaM-1 and M144V might make them very useful tools for understanding the role of NOS and nitric oxide in biological systems. It is likely that transfection of cells with SCaM-1 could selectively inhibit nNOS while still allowing the normal activation of other target enzymes. While there are similarities in the way that CaM binds and activates various target enzymes, it is becoming increasingly evident that CaM is capable of unique interactions with many of these enzymes. This concept has been supported by several mutagenesis studies and by the production of CaM antibodies that recognize specific CaM target enzyme complexes (9Su Z. Blazing M.A. Fan D. George S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29117-29122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 25Persechini A. Stemmer P.M. Ohashi I. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32217-32225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) suggest that calmodulin activation of many of its target enzymes “is dependent upon a distinct pattern of unique determinants in the four EF-hands of calmodulin.” Our study is in agreement with this, because it shows that a specific amino acid at position 144 in CaM's fourth EF-hand is a specific functional determinant for CaM activation of NOS. Unlike any of the manmade mutant CaM's, SCaM-1 with its M144V mutation is a selective competitive antagonist of NOS. This points out the potential of having CaM mutants or isoforms that can activate and/or competitively inhibit specific subsets of CaM target enzymes. Nitric oxide is known to play an important role in mediating plant disease resistance, and plants have a Ca2+/CaM-stimulated NOS that is similar to neuronal NOS (5Durner J. Wendehenne D. Klessig D.F.

Tamashiro W.M.S.C. Martins I.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For example, Ribeiro et al. (33Ribeiro E.A. Cunha F.Q. Tamashiro W.M.S.C. Martins I.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) used Western blots with a neuronal NOS antibody to show that an ∼166-kDa NOS is present in the cytosol, nucleus, and in the elongation zone of maize root tips. Furthermore, maize NOS, like mammalian NOS, was a Ca2+-dependent enzyme that was inhibited by inhibitors of mammalian NOS (33Ribeiro E.A. Cunha F.Q. Tamashiro W.M.S.C. Martins I.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Ribeiro et al. (33Ribeiro E.A. Cunha F.Q. Tamashiro W.M.S.C. Martins I.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) conclude the existence of a homologous NOS enzyme in this plant species with antigenic epitopes common to mammalian NOS isoforms. Thus, plants like maize, tobacco, soybeans, and wheat have a NOS that is similar to the Ca2+/CaM-sensitive NOS found in mammalian cells. Many plants also have CaM isoforms with an M144V mutation. A search of the Scripp's calcium-binding protein data bank indicate that wheat, potato, spinach, corn, barley, apple, and alfalfa have CaM isoforms with valine at position 144. We tested wheat germ-CaM and a potato CaM isoform that have a V144 and found that they were both competitive antagonist of NOS. Since many plants have CaM isoforms like SCaM-1 and a NOS like mammalian NOS, it is possible that plants may use the M144V mutation to produce a competitive antagonist of NOS and alter cell function. We have recently shown that while SCaM-1 is expressed in healthy soybeans and tobacco plants, SCaM-4 expression is rapidly induced when plants are challenged by fungal elicitors or bacterial pathogens (34Heo W.D. Lee S.H. Kim M.C. Kim C.J. Chung W.S. Chun H.J. Lee K.J. Park C.Y. Park H.C. Choi J.Y. Cho M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). SCaM-4 expression correlated with the expression of several protective pathogen-resistant proteins. We have previously predicted that if SCaM-1 inhibits plant NOS, then pathogens could perhaps induce NOS activation by expression of SCaM-4 (16Cho M.J. Vaghy P.L. Kondo R. Lee S.H. Davis J.P. Rehl R. Heo W.D. Johnson J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15593-15597Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that when soybean (6Delledonne M. Xia Y. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. Nature. 1998; 394: 585-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar) and tobacco (7Marletta M.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 927-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar) cells are exposed to pathogens, a Ca-dependent NOS is activated producing a 4–5-fold increase in NO production. In both plants, NO induced the synthesis of pathogen-resistant proteins and hypersensitive cell death to protect the plant from pathogen attack. Mammalian NOS inhibitors prevented the hypersensitive disease resistance response to pathogen, resulting in a promotion of the disease and bacterial growth (6Delledonne M. Xia Y. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. Nature. 1998; 394: 585-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 7Marletta M.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 927-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). The introduction of recombinant mammalian NOS to tobacco plants stimulated the production of pathogen-resistant proteins (7Marletta M.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 927-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). If SCaM-1 inhibits plant NOS like it inhibits mammalian NOS, then it is likely that it could prevent NO production and hypersensitive cell death in healthy plants. The SCaM-4 isoform activates NOS (16Cho M.J. Vaghy P.L. Kondo R. Lee S.H. Davis J.P. Rehl R. Heo W.D. Johnson J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15593-15597Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and its expression when a plant is challenged by a pathogen could result in the activation of plant NOS, the production of NO and pathogen-resistant proteins to protect the plant from pathogen attack. These speculations can be tested by determining the effect of SCaM-1 and SCaM-4 on activation of soybean NOS. If soybean NOS is competitively inhibited by SCaM-1 and M144V, then it would appear that nature has designed this M144V point mutation in SCaM-1 to produce a selective competitive antagonist of NOS. We appreciate the excellent technical assistance of Candice Bookwalter."
https://openalex.org/W1983504620,"Grb2-associated binder 1 (GAB1) is a docking protein found to associate with the activated c-MET receptor via the MET-binding domain (MBD) and appears to be critical for the tubulogenic actions of this receptor. Pull-down experiments with bacterially expressed MBD and full-length GAB1 revealed the presence of c-MET as well as phosphorylated ERK2 (pERK2). By using purified pERK2 and non-pERK2, we found that GAB1 associates exclusively with the phosphorylated form of the enzyme and that this association does not require mediation by a third protein. When epitope-taggedGAB1 was co-transfected with constitutively activeMEK1 into A293 cells, co-immunoprecipitation of GAB1 and pERK2 was observed, demonstrating that this interaction can occur in intact cells. In vitro, both the MBD and full-length GAB1 were found to be substrates for activated ERK2. In intact cells, epitope-tagged GAB1 was found to be basally phosphorylated on serine with an increase following co-transfection with constitutively activeMEK1 and the appearance of novel phosphorylation sites detected by phosphopeptide mapping. Thus, it appears that GAB1 can associate directly with phosphorylated ERK2 via the MET-binding domain and that GAB1 then acts as a substrate for the enzyme."

This report explores the interaction of protein S with FVa and identifies an essential binding site for FVa on protein S involving the region of residues 621–635. Peptide PSP14 representing this region was a potent inhibitor of FVa binding to protein S and of FVa-dependent prothrombin activation and was anticoagulant in clotting assays. The inhibitory effect of peptide PSP14 was only observed in the presence of FVa, but the inhibition was not dependent on the presence or concentration of phospholipids. However, increasing FXa concentrations from 0.2 to 8 nm negated the inhibitory activity of PSP14, suggesting that PSP14 may compete with FXa for a binding site on FVa. This hypothesis was supported by a plot of 1/v versus[PSP14] at varying [FXa], which revealed the pattern for a competitive inhibitor with an apparent K i of ∼2 μm. Competition between FXa and protein S for binding to FVa has not been directly demonstrated but is consistent with the report that a FVa 15-mer peptide binds both protein S and FXa (31Heeb M.J. Kojima Y. Hackeng T.M. Griffin J.H. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1883-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 32Gale A.J. Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. Thromb.

Fibrinol. 1991; 2: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).The inhibitory potency of peptide PSP14 was enhanced by an internal disulfide bond introduced by the substitution of Cys for Ser635, because reduced and alkylated PSP14 and a peptide analog with Ser in position 635 were less potent than the cyclized peptide. Single amino acid substitutions in PSP14 analogs showed that Lys 630, 631, and 633 were each critical for prothrombinase inhibition. Although a short peptide with the linear sequence of residues 628–635 containing these Lys residues was not a potent inhibitor, cyclization of the peptide by addition of two Cys residues at the end of the peptide rendered it potently anticoagulant (Table II). Because the degrees of freedom that determine the relative populations of various conformations for a given peptide are greatly reduced in a cyclic peptide, it appears that some of the conformations of cyclized PSP14 and PSP629 may resemble those of native protein S.The anticoagulant and binding inhibitory effects of PSP14 were not due simply to its net positive charge per se, because a trilysine peptide, peptides with the same scrambled l-amino acid sequence (PSP14SCR) or with the same sequence ofd-amino acids and unrelated pentadecapeptides with four basic residues had little or no ability to inhibit binding of protein S to FVa or to inhibit prothrombinase or clotting assays.Other evidence for specificity of the inhibitory effects of peptide PSP14 was presented in several forms. Antibodies to PSP14 blocked protein S binding to FVa and neutralized the prothrombinase inhibitory activity of protein S. Neither PSP14 nor anti-PSP14 antibodies could block binding of biotin-FXa to protein S. Moreover, the ability of PSP14 to inhibit prothrombinase was entirely dependent on the presence of FVa. The fact that PSP14 was anticoagulant in protein C-depleted plasma is consistent with the concepts that protein S is anticoagulant in the absence of protein C and that the region of residues 621–635 is involved in protein S-FVa interactions.Residues 621–635 are not necessary for complexation of protein S with C4b-binding protein because peptide PSP14 did not inhibit binding of protein S to C4b-binding protein.

The present identification of a binding site for FVa involving protein S residues 620–635 that does not bind FXa, protein C, or C4b-binding protein and is not dependent on the presence of phosholipids extends our understanding of the multiple anticoagulant mechanisms of protein S. Protein S is a vitamin K-dependent protein that can act as a cofactor for the anticoagulant functions of activated protein C (1DiScipio R.G. Davie E.W.

The physiological importance of protein S is underscored by the finding that infusions of protein S concentrates without activated protein C showed antithrombotic activity in a rabbit thrombosis model (15Schwarz H.P. Linnau Y. Pfeiler S. Molinari E. Thromb. Haemost. 1989; 62 (Abstr.): 25Google Scholar). Modes of antithrombotic action of protein S are, however, incompletely understood. Protein S can be anticoagulant even in the absence of activated protein C by inhibiting prothrombinase activity of the FVa-FXa complex in fluid phase and on phospholipid vesicles, endothelial cells, or platelets (16Heeb M.J.

In addition, protein S inhibits thrombin generation when subendothelial matrix is exposed to plasma under flow conditions (19van't Veer C. Hackeng T.M. Biesbroeck D. Sixma J.J. Bouma B.N. Blood. 1995; 85: 1815-1821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The relative anticoagulant potency of protein S has been correlated with its affinity for phospholipid vesicles, and protein S competes with prothrombinase components particularly at limiting phospholipid concentrations, e.g.0.2 μm (20van Wijnen M. Stam J.G. van't Veer C. Meijers J.C.M. Reitsma P.H. Bertina R.M. Bouma B.N. Thromb. Haemostas. 1996; 76: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). An assay has been developed for the activated protein C-independent activity of protein S in individual plasma samples (21van Wijnen M. van't Veer C. Meijers J.C.M. Bertina R.M. Bouma B.N. Thromb. Haemostas. 1998; 80: 930-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). FV in combination with protein S enhances activated protein C anticoagulant activity (22Shen L. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18735-18738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it was suggested that this complex phenomenon may involve binding of the sex hormone binding globulin region of protein S residues 270–635 to FV (23Nyberg P. Dahlbäck B. Garcia de Frutos P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 14: 28-32Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Studies presented here identify an essential binding site for FVa at the C terminus of protein S that contributes to the ability of protein S to inhibit prothrombinase activity. DISCUSSIONA novel mechanism of anticoagulant action of protein S involves its ability to function independently of activated protein C, via its binding to FVa, FXa, and/or phospholipids, thereby causing inhibition of prothrombinase activity (16Heeb M.J.

The present identification of a binding site for FVa involving protein S residues 620–635 that does not bind FXa, protein C, or C4b-binding protein and is not dependent on the presence of phosholipids extends our understanding of the multiple anticoagulant mechanisms of protein S. A novel mechanism of anticoagulant action of protein S involves its ability to function independently of activated protein C, via its binding to FVa, FXa, and/or phospholipids, thereby causing inhibition of prothrombinase activity (16Heeb M.J.

This report explores the interaction of protein S with FVa and identifies an essential binding site for FVa on protein S involving the region of residues 621–635. Peptide PSP14 representing this region was a potent inhibitor of FVa binding to protein S and of FVa-dependent prothrombin activation and was anticoagulant in clotting assays. The inhibitory effect of peptide PSP14 was only observed in the presence of FVa, but the inhibition was not dependent on the presence or concentration of phospholipids. However, increasing FXa concentrations from 0.2 to 8 nm negated the inhibitory activity of PSP14, suggesting that PSP14 may compete with FXa for a binding site on FVa. This hypothesis was supported by a plot of 1/v versus[PSP14] at varying [FXa], which revealed the pattern for a competitive inhibitor with an apparent K i of ∼2 μm. Competition between FXa and protein S for binding to FVa has not been directly demonstrated but is consistent with the report that a FVa 15-mer peptide binds both protein S and FXa (31Heeb M.J. Kojima Y. Hackeng T.M. Griffin J.H. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1883-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 32Gale A.J. Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; (Abstr.)PubMed Google Scholar) and with reports that protein S negates the ability of FXa to protect FVa from proteolytic inactivation by activated protein C (33Solymoss S. Tucker M.M. Tracy P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14884-14890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Jane S.M. Hau L. Salem H.H. Blood Coag. Fibrinol. 1991; 2: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The inhibitory potency of peptide PSP14 was enhanced by an internal disulfide bond introduced by the substitution of Cys for Ser635, because reduced and alkylated PSP14 and a peptide analog with Ser in position 635 were less potent than the cyclized peptide. Single amino acid substitutions in PSP14 analogs showed that Lys 630, 631, and 633 were each critical for prothrombinase inhibition. Although a short peptide with the linear sequence of residues 628–635 containing these Lys residues was not a potent inhibitor, cyclization of the peptide by addition of two Cys residues at the end of the peptide rendered it potently anticoagulant (Table II). Because the degrees of freedom that determine the relative populations of various conformations for a given peptide are greatly reduced in a cyclic peptide, it appears that some of the conformations of cyclized PSP14 and PSP629 may resemble those of native protein S. The anticoagulant and binding inhibitory effects of PSP14 were not due simply to its net positive charge per se, because a trilysine peptide, peptides with the same scrambled l-amino acid sequence (PSP14SCR) or with the same sequence ofd-amino acids and unrelated pentadecapeptides with four basic residues had little or no ability to inhibit binding of protein S to FVa or to inhibit prothrombinase or clotting assays. Other evidence for specificity of the inhibitory effects of peptide PSP14 was presented in several forms. Antibodies to PSP14 blocked protein S binding to FVa and neutralized the prothrombinase inhibitory activity of protein S. Neither PSP14 nor anti-PSP14 antibodies could block binding of biotin-FXa to protein S. Moreover, the ability of PSP14 to inhibit prothrombinase was entirely dependent on the presence of FVa. The fact that PSP14 was anticoagulant in protein C-depleted plasma is consistent with the concepts that protein S is anticoagulant in the absence of protein C and that the region of residues 621–635 is involved in protein S-FVa interactions. Residues 621–635 are not necessary for complexation of protein S with C4b-binding protein because peptide PSP14 did not inhibit binding of protein S to C4b-binding protein. Sites for interaction of protein S with C4b-binding protein have been reported in the steroid hormone binding globulin domain (35Chang G.T.G. Maas B.H.A. Ploos van Amstel H.K. Reitsma P.H.

Peptides overlapping each of these regions in protein S did not inhibit prothrombinase activity (Table I), indicating that this experimental approach fails to implicate these sequences as essential for sites of interaction of protein S with FVa or FXa. The region in the FVa molecule with which residues 621–635 of protein S should interact remains a matter of speculation. A stretch of 14 amino acid residues in FVa (residues 493–506, GLLLICKSRSLDRR) potently inhibits prothrombinase activity and has been implicated in the binding of FVa to protein S, FXa, DEGR-FXa, and DIP-activated protein C but not to activated protein C or prothrombin (31Heeb M.J. Kojima Y. Hackeng T.M. Griffin J.H. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1883-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 32Gale A.J. Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. Thromb.

It seems unlikely that this sequence in FVa interacts with residues 620–635 in protein S because of the likely electrostatic repulsion of the net positive charges of these sequences (+3 and +4, respectively). However, each peptide also contains a region of uncharged residues. It is likely that protein S and FVa have more than one site of molecular interaction. In the case of activated protein C interaction with FVa, three sites of molecular interaction have been suggested in the light and heavy chains of activated protein C, and two sites have been suggested in the light and heavy chains of FVa (24Mesters R.M.

In this report, we describe the genetic and molecular characterization of skb5 (for Shk1 kinasebinding protein 5), a gene encoding a novel SH3 domain protein that interacts with Shk1 in vivo and in vitro. We present genetic evidence for functional interaction between Skb5 and Shk1 in S. pombe and biochemical evidence that Skb5 is a direct stimulator of Shk1 catalytic function. Our results provide what is to our knowledge the first example of direct activation of a PAK by an SH3 domain protein.

The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the full-length skb5protein coding sequence for cloning into pAAUCM, pART1CM, pREP1, pGADGH, and pRP259, producing pAAUCMSkb5, pART1CMSkb5, pREP1Skb5, pGADGHSkb5, and pRP259Skb5, respectively. The primer pair SKB5KOP3 (5′-GAAGCTTCAGGAAGAAGCG) and SKB5KOP6 (5′-CAGGCTCGAGAATGTCCATTATTCGTGATCA) was used to amplify a 0.95-kb fragment of the 3′-end of skb5. This fragment was then digested with HindIII and EcoRV and cloned intoHindIII and HincII sites of pBluescriptII, producing pBSIIskb5-3. The primer pair SKB5KOP7 (5′-ACTATATGGTGGAGCTCAGTGCAA) and SKB5KOP2 (5′-ACACAAGCTTCAATCACACGAGCAT) was used to amplify a 0.8-kb fragment of the 5′-end of skb5, which was digested with SacI and HindIII and cloned into the corresponding sites of pBSIIskb5-3 generating pBSIIskb5KO. This pBSIIskb5KO was digested withHindIII and ligated with a 1.8-kb HindIII fragment of the ura4 gene to produce pBSIIskb5::ura4. Shk1 (1–380) and Skb5 (1–88) protein coding sequences were both obtained by polymerase chain reaction and then cloned into pVJL11 and pGADGH, respectively, generating pVJL11Shk1 (1–380) and pGADGHSkb5 (1–88). For kinase assays and coprecipitation experiments using proteins purified fromS. pombe cell lysates, S. pombe cells expressing GST fusion proteins, either alone or in combination with CMSkb5, were grown in EMM to about 107 cells/ml, washed with yeast lysis buffer, and resuspended in yeast lysis buffer before lysing using glass beads as described previously (15Yang P. Kansra S. Pimental R.A. Gilbreth M. Marcus S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18481-18489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were precipitated from yeast cell lysates using glutathione-agarose beads as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For coprecipitation experiments, immunoblots were performed as described previously using anti-GST antibody (Pierce) and anti-c-Myc antibody 9E10 (27Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). Kinase assays of purified GST proteins were carried out at 30 °C in 25 μl of kinase buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm MnCl2, 0.1 μg/μl MBP, 50 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol)). Reactions were terminated after 20 min by adding 4 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Novex) and boiling for 5 min. Assays were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography. GST and GST-Skb5 were purified from bacterial lysates using glutathione-agarose following the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), except that protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μmpepstatin A, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 36 μg/ml E-64, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) were used in the lysis buffer. Bacterial cells expressing His6-Shk1 were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer B (50 mm NaF, 10 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmC3H7O6PNa2, 137 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol), while His6-Ha-Ras cultures were lysed in lysis buffer C (10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 10%, glycerol, and 0.5% dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (Calbiochem). His6-tagged proteins were purified using nickel-agarose beads following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Proteins were concentrated and exchanged into storage buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) using Centriprep-5 concentrators (Millipore). Kinase assays were performed at 30 °C in kinase buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.04 μg/μl MBP, 20 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol)). Reactions were terminated after 20 min by addition of 4 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Novex) and boiling for 5 min prior to resolving on a 4–15% SDS-PAGE gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and subsequent autoradiography. We previously described a two-hybrid screen for identification of Shk1-interacting proteins (17Gilbreth M. Yang P. Wang D. Frost J. Polverino A. Cobb M.H. Marcus S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13802-13807Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Partial cDNAs corresponding to two distinct S. pombe genes were identified as a result of this screen, skb1, which has been described previously (17Gilbreth M. Yang P. Wang D. Frost J. Polverino A. Cobb M.H. Marcus S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13802-13807Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), andskb5 (previously referred to as skb2 (17Gilbreth M. Yang P. Wang D. Frost J. Polverino A. Cobb M.H. Marcus S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13802-13807Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)), which we describe in this report. The full-length skb5 gene was cloned by a hybridization screen of an S. pombe genomic library. Sequence analysis revealed that the skb5 gene (GenBankTM accession number AF192549) contains an uninterrupted open reading frame encoding a small protein, 140 amino acids in length, with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 16 kDa (Fig. 1 A). The Skb5 protein contains a single C-terminal SH3 domain (amino acids 87–136) and a highly acidic N terminus. BLAST searches of the nucleic acid and protein sequence data bases revealed that Skb5 shares structural homology with an unpublished S. cerevisiae protein, Nbp2 (35% overall identity), and an alternative, non-tyrosine kinase product, c-Scr, encoded by the chicken c-src gene (28Dorai T. Wang L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4068-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) (26% identity) (Fig. 1 B). The SH3 domain of Skb5 is 50% identical with the SH3 domain of Nbp2 and 36% identical with the SH3 domain of c-Scr. We determined that the SH3 domain of Skb5 is both necessary and sufficient for interaction with Shk1 in the two-hybrid system (Table I). N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of Shk1 were used to determine that Skb5 interacts with the N-terminal regulatory domain of Shk1 (Table I). This result suggested that Skb5 might be a Shk1 regulator.Table ITwo-hybrid interactions between Skb5 and Shk1 proteinsLBD fusionsGAD fusionsSkb5Skb5(74–140)Skb5(1–88)Bry2Shk11676.70873.500.130.23Shk1(308–658)0.130.100.120.13Shk1(1–380)285.401747.200.200.18Ras10.260.290.2824.57 Open table in a new tab Genetic and molecular analyses were performed to establish whether the interaction between Skb5 and Shk1 is biologically significant. We first expressed Skb5 as a c-Myc epitope-tagged protein (CMSkb5) in fission yeast to determine whether it coprecipitates with full-length Shk1, as well as the original Shk1 two-hybrid bait protein, Shk1ΔN118, which were each fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST-Shk1 and GST-Shk1ΔN118, respectively). Shk1ΔN118 corresponds to the originally published Shk1 protein sequence (2Marcus S. Polverino A. Chang E. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Wigler M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6180-6184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), which was truncated by 118 amino acids due to a sequencing error. Shk1ΔN118 can substitute for full-length Shk1 protein in S. pombecells. 2S. M., unpublished results. CMSkb5 coprecipitated with GST-Shk1 and GST-Shk1ΔN118 from S. pombe cell lysates, but did not coprecipitate with GST (Fig. 2), demonstrating that Skb5 and Shk1 proteins form a complex in S. pombe. An skb5 null (skb5Δ) mutation was generated in which most of the skb5 protein coding sequence was replaced by the ura4 gene (Fig. 3 A). Unlike shk1Δmutants, skb5Δ mutants were viable and exhibited no obvious phenotypic defects under normal growth conditions in either rich or minimal media (data not shown). skb5Δ mutants were also indistinguishable from wild-type cells when grown at either 20 or 36 °C, indicating that the skb5Δ mutation does not cause cold or temperature sensitive phenotypes, respectively (data not shown). Recent studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that Cdc42, Shk1, and Skb1 are each required for normal response to hypertonic stress in S. pombe. 3P. Yang, R. Pimental, H. Lai, and S. Marcus, manuscript in preparation. S. pombe mutants expressing a dominant inhibitory mutant allele ofcdc42 are inviable and cells deficient in Shk1 expression are growth impaired when cultured in hypertonic medium.skb1Δ mutants, which are normally only modestly shorter than wild-type cells, become ellipsoidal in shape when subjected to hypertonic stress. These observations prompted us to investigate whether the growth or morphology of skb5Δ mutants is affected by hypertonic stress. Indeed, we found that skb5Δmutants grew slower than wild-type cells and became ellipsoidal in morphology when grown in 1.5 m KCl (Fig. 3, Band C), demonstrating that Skb5, like Cdc42, Shk1, and Skb1, is required for normal growth and morphology of S. pombecells in hypertonic medium. Additional genetic analyses were performed to further establish a functional link between Skb5 and Shk1. We determined that overexpression of Shk1 is significantly less inhibitory to the growth of skb5Δ cells than to wild-type cells (Fig. 3 D), providing evidence that Skb5 might be required for normal Shk1 function in S. pombe. We found further that Skb5 overexpression was inhibitory to the growth of S. pombecells expressing a dominant inhibitory mutant allele ofcdc42, cdc42T17N, and that this growth defect could be suppressed by overexpression of Shk1ΔN118 (Fig. 3 E). Shk1ΔN118 was used for this experiment because, for reasons that at present are unclear, overexpression of full-length Shk1 is highly toxic to cells expressing Cdc42T17N. 4P. Yang and S. Marcus, unpublished results. Interestingly, we observed that wild-type cells that overexpressed Skb5 were spheroidal in morphology (data not shown), suggesting that Skb5 overexpression may have a dominant inhibitory effect with respect to function of the Cdc42/Shk1 morphological control pathway in S. pombe, possibly due to sequestration of Shk1 from proper interaction with its other regulators and/or targets. This idea is consistent with the observation that overexpression of Skb5 was inhibitory to growth of cells expressing Cdc42T17N and that overexpression of Shk1ΔN118 could suppress this growth defect. Although overexpression of Shk1 could not suppress hypertonic stress-induced growth or morphological defects of the skb5Δ mutant (data not shown), these defects were suppressed by overexpression of the Shk1 modulator Skb1 (Fig. 3,B and C). These various genetic data provide strong evidence that Skb5 and Shk1 interact functionally in S. pombe, with Skb5 possibly functioning as a positive regulator of Shk1. Biochemical experiments were performed to establish whether Skb5 regulates the catalytic function of Shk1. S. pombe cells expressing GST or GST-Shk1ΔN118, both with and without co-overexpression of Skb5, were lysed and GST and GST-Shk1ΔN118 proteins purified from the resulting cell lysates. Kinase assays were then performed to measure the ability of GST-Shk1ΔN118 to both autophosphorylate and phosphorylate MBP. GST-Shk1ΔN118 was used for this experiment, because we found that a GST fusion of the full-length Shk1 protein was expressed at a substantially higher level in cells that overexpressed Skb5, making it impossible to obtain meaningful comparisons of Shk1 kinase activity between cells that overexpressed Skb5 and cells that did not. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the phosphorylation of MBP by GST-Shk1ΔN118 was significantly greater for protein isolated from cells that overexpressed Skb5 than from cells that did not, while autophosphorylation of GST-Shk1ΔN118 was only slightly increased for protein isolated from cells that overexpressed Skb5 (Fig. 4 A). No detectable kinase activity was observed for the GST samples. These results suggest that Skb5 stimulates Shk1 catalytic activity in vivo and that it might do so without substantially affecting Shk1 autophosphorylation. We next asked whether Skb5 directly stimulates Shk1 catalytic function by determining whether recombinant Skb5 protein purified from bacterial cells directly stimulates the catalytic function of bacterially expressed Shk1 protein. Skb5 was purified in recombinant form as a GST fusion protein (GST-Skb5), while Shk1 was purified as a polyhistidine-tagged protein (His6-Shk1) (Fig. 4 B). GST-Skb5 and His6-Shk1, as well as the control proteins GST and His6-Ha-Ras, were mixed together in various combinations and assayed for kinase activity. Strikingly, we observed that GST-Skb5 strongly stimulated the ability of His6-Shk1 to phosphorylate MBP, but without stimulating Shk1 autophosphorylation (Fig. 4 C). This result demonstrates that Skb5 directly stimulates Shk1 catalytic function in vitro. The observed decrease in His6-Shk1 autophosphorylation in the presence of GST-Skb5 (Fig. 4 C) was most likely due to substrate competition by MBP, since in assays lacking MBP, GST-Skb5 had no affect on the autophosphorylation of Shk1 (Fig. 4 D). In addition to stimulating Shk1 catalytic function, GST-Skb5 was also phosphorylated by Shk1 in vitro(Fig. 4, C and D). We have determined fromin vivo labeling experiments that Skb5 is also a phosphoprotein in S. pombe (data not shown); however, we do not yet know whether its in vivo phosphorylation is dependent on Shk1. In summary, we have described the genetic and molecular characterization of a novel SH3 domain protein, Skb5, that positively regulates the function of the fission yeast PAK Shk1. Skb5 clearly plays only an auxiliary role in regulating the overall function of Shk1. While the shk1Δ mutation is lethal to S. pombe cells, skb5Δ cells lack any discernible phenotypic defects under normal growth conditions. Even under conditions of hypertonic stress, skb5Δ mutants, while spheroidal in shape, are only modestly inhibited for growth. It is possible that Skb5 plays a more significant cellular role under environmental conditions that we have not tested or that Skb5 is functionally redundant with another protein(s) (e.g. another Skb5-related protein). Alternatively, it is conceivable that the proper regulation of cell morphology under conditions of hypertonic stress does not represent an essential function of Shk1. Although its cellular role, as presently defined, is potentially modest, the identification and characterization of Skb5 is significant, because it represents what is to our knowledge the first example of an SH3 domain protein capable of directly stimulating the catalytic activity of a purified PAK. Previous studies have demonstrated interactions between mammalian PAKs and SH3 domain proteins, specifically, the SH2/SH3 adaptor protein Nck (29Bokoch G.M. Wang Y. Bohl B.P. Sells M.A. Quilliam L.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25746-25749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and the Cdc42/Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor proteins α-and β-PIX (30Manser E. Loo T.H.

Nck and PIX proteins are thought to function in recruiting PAKs to Cdc42 and/or Rac complexes in the cell, where the PAKs are subsequently activated by the p21 G proteins (29Bokoch G.M. Wang Y.

A mutated form of PIX lacking its guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain was capable of stimulating the kinase activity of a PAK immune complex in vitro, suggesting that PIX also has Cdc42/Rac-independent PAK stimulatory function (32Daniels R.H. Zenke F.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6047-6050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, since these experiments used PAK immune complexes, they did not provide an indication of whether PIX function is sufficient to directly stimulate PAK catalytic function, as other proteins in the immune complex may have been required for this activity. The founding member of the PAK family, the budding yeast Ste20 kinase (7Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 33Ramer S.W. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), has also been shown to form a complex with the SH3 domain protein Bem1 (34Leeuw T. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Wu C. Chenevert J. Clark K. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. Science. 1995; 270: 1210-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), although the functional nature of this interaction has not yet been defined. Based on these previously described findings and those presented in this report, it is reasonable to speculate that functional regulation by SH3 domain proteins represents a broadly conserved primordial feature of eukaryotic PAKs that has been modified and reiterated through the course of evolution to provide multiple mechanisms for PAK activation, thereby allowing these kinases to regulate numerous and diverse cellular processes. Moreover, our results raise the exciting possibility that PAKs in higher organisms might, in some cases, be directly activated by SH3 domain proteins. This potential alternative mechanism for PAK activation may ultimately help to explain how PAKs are functionally regulated such that they can be targeted to perform the diverse cellular functions to which they have been linked in eukaryotic organisms.

After 170 days of therapy, both cats were physically indistinguishable from normal cats with the exception of mild corneal clouding. FelineN-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase was effective in reducing urinary glycosaminoglycan levels and lysosomal storage in all cell types examined except for corneal keratocytes and cartilage chondrocytes. In addition, skeletal pathology was nearly normalized as assessed by radiographic evidence and bone morphometric analysis. Comparison of results with a previous study in which recombinant human 4S (rh4S) was used at an equivalent dose and one 5 times higher indicated that rf4S had a more pronounced effect on reducing pathology than the same dose of rh4S, and in some instances such as bone pathology and lysosomal storage in aorta smooth muscle cells, it was as good as, or better than, the higher dose of rh4S. We conclude that in the feline MPS VI model the use of native or same species enzyme for enzyme replacement therapy has significant benefits.

In MPS VI (Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome) the enzyme deficient is N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (4S; EC 3.1.6.12) (1Neufeld E.F. Meunzer J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2465-2494Google Scholar). 4S hydrolyzes the 4-sulfated ester bond on nonreducing terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residues and hence is involved in the degradation of the GAG dermatan sulfate (DS) and chondroitin-4-sulfate. Failure to degrade these GAG results in the storage of partially catabolized DS and chondroitin-4-sulfate in lysosomes, leading to progressive organ dysfunction and clinical symptoms such as skeletal abnormalities including epiphyseal dysplasia, dwarfism, and facial dysmorphism, as well as widespread soft tissue pathology (e.g. corneal clouding, hepatosplenomegaly, joint stiffness, and heart valve thickening). Patients with a severe MPS VI phenotype generally die from cardiac and respiratory failure in the first to second decade of life. Unlike many of the MPS, there is no obvious central nervous system involvement in MPS VI. Present treatment of MPS patients is mostly limited to medical and surgical intervention aimed at alleviating symptoms when they occur. Bone marrow transplantation has been extensively evaluated for some MPS types and is currently considered of clinical benefit for MPS I and VI if treatment is commenced early (2Krivit W. Pierpont M.E. Ayaz K. Tsai M. Ramsay N.K. Kersey J.H. Weisdorf F. Sibley R. Snover D. McGovern M.M. Schwartz M.F. Desnick R.J. N. Engl. J.

Dis. 1993; 16: 1024-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, it is clearly not totally effective. The fact that bone marrow transplantation is generally administered after diagnosis of clinical symptoms may provide one explanation for its limited effectiveness in modifying bone and central nervous system pathology. Besides bone marrow transplantation, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is the only current therapeutic treatment for lysosomal storage disorders. Its therapeutic success has been exemplified in the treatment of nonneuronopathic Gaucher disease, where it has transformed the management of this disorder (4Barton N.W. Furbish F.S. Murray G.J. Garfield M. Brady R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1913-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). A crucial requirement for ERT is the availability of relatively large amounts of enzyme. This has been made possible by the application of recombinant DNA technology. Recombinant enzymes produced in mammalian expression systems have the mannose 6-phosphate recognition signal required for targeting to the lysosome via the mannose 6-phosphate receptor (5Kornfeld S. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 462-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). This receptor is present on the plasma and endosomal membranes of most cell types. Exogenous enzyme is rapidly endocytosed to lysosomes by cultured lysosomal storage disorder cells and is effective in removing stored substrate (6Anson D.S. Taylor J.A. Bielicki J. Harper G.S.

A number of inherited lysosomal enzyme deficiencies have been reported in animals, and these have been exploited to explore possible therapeutic strategies. ERT, for example, has been shown to be effective in several of these animal models of lysosomal storage disorders including the MPS VII mouse (11Vogler C. Sands M. Higgins A. Levy B. Grubb J. Birkenmeier E.H. Sly W.S. Pediatric Res. 1993; 34: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the MPS I dog (12Shull R.M. Kakkis E.D. McEntee M.F. Kania S.A. Jonas A.J. Neufeld E.F. Proc.

The MPS VI cat is an excellent large animal model for studying the somatic pathology associated with the MPS and particularly for the skeletal abnormalities that are a predominant feature of this disorder. In the published studies of ERT in MPS VI cats (14Crawley A.C. Brooks D.A. Muller V.J. Petersen B.A. Isaac E.L. Bielicki J. King B.M. Boulter C.D. Moore A.J. Fazzalari N.L. Anson D.S. Byers S.

Bone. 1997; 21: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), recombinant human 4S (rh4S) was used. A correlation between earlier onset of therapy and a trend toward normalization of bone mineral volume in vertebral bone samples was observed, and in general, the cats appeared more mobile and had improved quality of life. MPS VI kittens treated for 6 months from birth with various doses of rh4S ranging from 0.2 to 5 mg/kg body weight showed a marked reduction in skeletal pathology, which was dose-dependent. Urinary GAG levels and lysosomal storage in most organs were nearly normalized. However, no discernible reduction in lysosomal vacuolation in cartilage, cornea, or leukocytes was apparent. In this paper, we present an evaluation of the efficacy of species-specific ERT in an MPS VI cat model and compare this with a previous study that utilized the human equivalent of this enzyme. Our results indicate that treatment of MPS VI cats with recombinant feline 4S (rf4S) is significantly more efficacious than treatment with rh4S at the same dose. Cloning of the f4S gene and its expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells are detailed by Yogalingam et al. (17Yogalingam G. Litjens T. Bielicki J. Crawley A.C. Muller V. Anson D.S. Hopwood J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27259-27265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For large scale production of rf4S, cells were grown to confluence on Cytodex 2 microcarriers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) at 3 g/liter in 12 liters of 10% (w/v) fetal calf serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/COON′S F12 medium (CSL Ltd., Parkville, Victoria, Australia). Once confluence was attained, the culture medium was changed by rapid perfusion to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/COON′S F12 medium supplemented with 0.5 mm butyric acid and 5 mmNH4Cl to enhance enzyme production (18Chang P.L. Ameen M. Yu C.Z. Kelly B.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 176: 258-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 19Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20602-20607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The production phase of this fermentation was run as a 12-liter stirred continuous culture with perfusion carried out at approximately 0.2 volumes/106 cells/ml/day. The culture dissolved oxygen concentration (measured in situ with an Ingold oxygen probe) was monitored and controlled with FC4 software (Real Time Engineering, Sydney, Australia) and maintained at approximately 40% saturation with sparged oxygen. Culture pH, maintained at 7.4 with sparged CO2, was also measured in situ using an Applikon pH probe (Enztech Pty. Ltd., Sydney, Australia) and monitored by the above software. The addition of alkali or antifoam was unnecessary. Collected culture supernatant was stored at 4 °C, with the addition of 0.1% (w/v) sodium azide, until use. The rf4S was purified from culture medium by immunoaffinity chromatography using Affi-Gel 10 linked to monoclonal antibody F58.3, which recognizes both human and feline 4S (20Brooks D.A. Gibson G.J. Hopwood J.J. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1994; 53: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The enzyme was assessed for purity by SDS-PAGE (12% (w/v) acrylamide) according to the method of Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar), its activity determined with the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate as described previously (22Gibson G.J. Saccone G.T.P. Brooks D.A. Clements P.R. Hopwood J.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with the only modification being that 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 was included in the diluent. Protein concentration was determined using the Lowry method (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme for the trial was produced in several batches, which were pooled and then stored in aliquots in PBS under sterile conditions at 4 °C until use. The isoelectric point (pI) of rh4S and rf4S was determined on 5% (w/v) acrylamide gels with 2% (v/v) ampholytes (BioLyte® 3/10 ampholytes, Bio-Rad) at 1300 V for 4 h using a Bio-Phoresis Horizontal Electrophoresis Cell (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples of both enzymes treated with 80 milliunits of neuraminidase (Sigma) for 60 min at 37 °C were electrofocused in a similar manner. Bio-Rad isoelectric focusing (IEF) standards covering the range from pH 4.45 to 9.6 were used. Gels were fixed in 12% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, 4% (w/v) sulfosalicylic acid, and 30% (v/v) methanol and then stained with Coomassie Blue R250 (Sigma). The degree of glycosylation of both rf4S and rh4S was estimated by treatment with the endoglycosidase PNGase F purified from Flavobacterium meningosepticum (New England BioLabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions and utilizing reagents supplied with the PNGase F. Duplicate samples were treated in a similar manner but without the addition of PNGase F. The concentration of PNGase F used was 500 units/10 μg of 4S, and reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. All samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar). Two male MPS VI kittens born 1 week apart, the result of heterozygote matings from a naturally occurring feline model of MPS VI (24Jezyk P.F. Haskins M.E. Patterson D.F. Mellman W.J. Greenstein M. Science. 1977; 198: 834-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), were designated cat 249 and cat 250. They were diagnosed at birth by lack of stained eosinophil inclusions on blood films (15Crawley A.C. Niedzielski K.H. Isaac E.L. Davey R.C.A. Byers S. Hopwood J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cat genotype status was later confirmed by polymerase chain reaction-based mutation analysis from blood spots (17Yogalingam G. Litjens T. Bielicki J. Crawley A.C. Muller V. Anson D.S. Hopwood J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27259-27265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The protocol followed in this study is essentially as documented in Crawley et al. (15Crawley A.C. Niedzielski K.H. Isaac E.L. Davey R.C.A. Byers S. Hopwood J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, therapy was commenced within 24 h of birth by intravenous injection of 1 mg of rf4S/kg of body weight on a weekly basis for approximately 170 days. Throughout the course of therapy, the volume of enzyme injected ranged from 0.06 ml to 1.9 ml, and this was generally administered over 5–10 min. To maintain consistency between studies, oral antihistamine premedication was administered as detailed previously (15Crawley A.C. Niedzielski K.H. Isaac E.L. Davey R.C.A. Byers S. Hopwood J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cats were monitored on a daily basis for general well being by animal care attendants and observed on a weekly basis at the time of injection for development of overt MPS VI clinical symptoms. At 90, 150, and 170 days of age, cats were subjected to a rigorous clinical, neurological, and radiological examination as described in Crawley et al. (15Crawley A.C. Niedzielski K.H. Isaac E.L. Davey R.C.A. Byers S. Hopwood J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Blood was collected in heparinized tubes for determination of antibody titer to rf4S in plasma using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as follows. The wells of a 96-well microtiter plate were coated with 200 ng of rf4S/well (37 °C for 2 h and then overnight at 4 °C), after which blocking of any unreactive sites was done by the addition of 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.25 m NaCl, pH 7.0 (blocking buffer) (2 h at 20 °C). After washing the plate with Tris/NaCl buffer, cat plasma was serially diluted in blocking buffer and allowed to incubate on the plate for 4 h at 20 °C followed by peroxidase-labeled goat anti-cat Ig (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA) for 1 h at 20 °C. The assay was developed using peroxidase substrate solution (Bio-Rad ABTS substrate kit), and the color reaction was quantified by measuring absorbance at 414 nm in an automated microtiter plate reader (Ceres 900 HDi, Bio-Tek Instruments Inc.). As a control measure, all cat plasma was analyzed for nonspecific reactivity to wells coated with bovine serum albumin only. Immunoblotting of enzyme after electrophoresis onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) and detection with cat plasma samples followed by peroxidase-labeled goat anti-cat Ig and peroxidase substrate were performed as described previously (25Brooks D.A. King B.M. Crawley A.C. Byers S. Hopwood J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1361: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Urine samples were collected at the specified times and stored at −20 °C without preservative until assayed for GAG and uronic acid concentration. Total urinary GAG was measured using a modified Alcian Blue spectrophotometric method (26Gold E. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 99: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To determine uronic acid content of GAG, urine was adjusted with 50 mm sodium acetate buffer to pH 5 and chromatographed over an anion exchanger (DEAE Sephacel; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5. Under these conditions, sulfated GAG bound to the matrix and were subsequently eluted with 2 m NaCl in acetate buffer. After desalting on Sephadex G-10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 0.1 m ammonium formate buffer, pH 6, the concentration of uronic acid in these charged GAG species was estimated using the dihydroxydiphenyl method (27Blumenkrantz N. Asboe-Hansen G. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (6017) Google Scholar). GAG from urine samples processed in this manner was then analyzed by gradient PAGE (30–40% gradient of acrylamide) loading approximately 1 μg of uronic acid/lane (28Turnbull J.E. Hopwood J.J. Gallagher J.T. Jackson P. Gallagher J.T. A Laboratory Guide to Glycoconjugate Analysis. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1997: 261-277Crossref Google Scholar). Standards comprising tetra-, hexa-, and octasaccharides prepared from bovine lung heparin were a generous gift from Dr. J. Turnbull (University of Birmingham, United Kingdom). The gel was stained with silver nitrate, and particular bands as indicated in Fig. 3 were analyzed by densitometry using a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer with Molecular Dynamics ImageQuant software. Urine creatinine levels were measured using an autoanalyzer method (Synchron CX® System, Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA). To estimate relative proportions of DS in total urinary GAG, High Resolution Electrophoresis of cetylpyridinium chloride-precipitated GAG on cellulose acetate strips was performed, and the results were quantified by densitometry (29Hopwood J.J. Harrison J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To label newly mineralized bone, animals were injected subcutaneously with the fluorochrome dye calcein at a dose of 15 mg/kg on days 12 and 13 prior to euthanasia and with oxytetracycline on days 2 and 3 before euthanasia. At autopsy, the fifth lumbar vertebra (L5) was removed, wrapped in 0.9% (w/v) NaCl-soaked gauze, and stored at −80 °C until morphometric analysis. After thawing, the L5 vertebra was fixed in 10% (v/v) buffered formalin and dehydrated in increasing concentrations of acetone (70–100%) before embedding in methylmethacrylate resin. 5-μm undecalcified tissue sections were cut and stained with von Kossa stain to visualize mineralized bone. An automated image analysis system was used to quantify trabecular bone in the primary center of ossification. Static parameters of bone formation including bone mineral volume (BV/TV), bone surface density (BS/TV), trabecular thickness (TbTh), trabecular number (TbN), and trabecular separation (TbSp) were calculated using standard morphometric formulae (30Parfitt A.M. Drezner M.K. Glorieux F.H. Kanis J.A. Malluche H. Meurnier P.J. Ott S.M. Recker R.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1987; 2: 595-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (4920) Google Scholar, 31Recker R.R. Bone Histomorphometry: Techniques and interpretations. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1983Google Scholar). Dynamic parameters of bone formation (mineral apposition rate (MAR) and bone formation rate (BFR/BS)) were determined from unstained L5 vertebral sections by measuring the distance between fluorochrome dyes (calcein (green) and oxytetracycline (orange)) under UV light (420 nm) using a routine manual point counting technique. Standard formulae were then applied to calculate MAR and BFR/BS (30Parfitt A.M. Drezner M.K. Glorieux F.H. Kanis J.A. Malluche H. Meurnier P.J. Ott S.M. Recker R.R. J. Bone Miner.

CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1983Google Scholar), and results were compared with data from a previous study in which animals were injected with rh4S (16Byers S. Nuttall J.D. Crawley A.C. Hopwood J.J. Smith K. Fazzalari N.L. Bone. 1997; 21: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Standard radiographs (14Crawley A.C. Brooks D.A. Muller V.J. Petersen B.A. Isaac E.L. Bielicki J. King B.M. Boulter C.D. Moore A.J. Fazzalari N.L. Anson D.S. Byers S. Hopwood J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1864-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) were taken at 90 and 150 days and before euthanasia (170 days) to visualize bone growth and remodeling. Measurements of L5 vertebrae of male cats were made from radiographs taken on the 150th day of treatment rather than from the final radiographs at 170 days in order to allow comparison with data from the cats treated at 5 mg of rh4S/kg (therapy in 23 of these cats was terminated at 150 days, (15Crawley A.C. Niedzielski K.H. Isaac E.L. Davey R.C.A. Byers S. Hopwood J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar)). Vertebral width (W) was measured with vernier callipers at the narrowest point of the vertebra. At the midway point of this measurement and perpendicular to it, the distance between the epiphyses was designated the vertebral length (L). Ratios ofL:W were calculated from these values. Following a clinical, neurological, and radiological examination, cats were killed with an overdose of intravenous barbiturate 4 days after the final injection of rf4S. On autopsy, gross examination of tissues and joints was conducted, and samples of these tissues for electron microscopy and light microscopy were fixed and processed as described previously (15Crawley A.C. Niedzielski K.H. Isaac E.L. Davey R.C.A. Byers S. Hopwood J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To determine the degree of vacuolation in the cells of tissues, 1-μm sections were stained with toluidine blue, assessed at × 100–400 magnification, and graded subjectively as follows: 3+, severe degree of lysosomal storage; 2+, moderate; 1+, mild; ±, very mild; 0, no vacuolation. The spinal cord was exposed and examined for compression by removal of dorsal vertebral arches between the fourth cervical and fourth lumbar vertebra. Liver samples were frozen at −20 °C before processing. Samples of liver (1–2 g) were thawed, minced, and then homogenized for approximately 1–2 min on ice in twice their volume of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.25 m NaCl buffer, pH 7, using an Ultra T25-Turrax homogenizer (Janke & Kunkel, IKA®Labortechnik, Staufen, Germany). The homogenate was freeze/thawed six times and clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 50 mm sodium formate buffer, pH 3.5, before being assayed using radiolabeled trisaccharide substrate (22Gibson G.J. Saccone G.T.P. Brooks D.A. Clements P.R. Hopwood J.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Randomly selected cat livers were treated in the same way. Cat status, age at euthanasia, and the time in storage of the liver sample at −20 °C (shown in parentheses) were as follows: normal cat, 1 day old (8 months), two untreated MPS VI cats, 6 months (23 months) and 6 months (28 months), two MPS VI cats treated with 1 mg of rh4S/kg, 6 months (32 months) and 6 months (38 months), and two MPS VI cats treated with 5 mg of rh4S/kg, 5 months (33 months) and 5 months (55 months). Livers from cats 249 and 250 were stored at −20 °C for 6 months before assaying for 4S activity. Results of assays were normalized to total cell protein as estimated by the Lowry method (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess treated cats for hepatomegaly, wet weights of liver expressed as a percentage of total body weight at autopsy were compared with those of normal, untreated MPS VI and MPS VI rh4S-treated age- and sex-matched animals (two male MPS VI cats treated with 5 mg of rh4S/kg and euthanized at 5 months were included in this group). Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed t test assuming equal variance and accepting a p value of 0.05 as being statistically significant. The specific activity of rf4S purified for this trial was approximately 62,500 nmol/min/mg using 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate. Enzyme activity was stable at 4 °C in PBS with no evidence of loss of activity throughout the trial. IEF indicated seven major isoforms of rf4S and more than 10 of rh4S with pI ranging from 6.5 to 7.5 for rf4S and a much broader range of 4.45–7.0 for rh4S (Fig. 1 A). Digestion of both enzymes with neuraminidase resulted in a change in pI of certain isomers of rf4S; however, no obvious changes were observed for rh4S. PNGase F digestion of rf4S resulted in a decrease in M rof both the precursor and mature forms by 14 and 11%, respectively. A higher degree of glycosylation was observed for rh4S, since the change in M r was greater than for rf4S (22% for the precursor form and 20% for the mature form) (Fig. 1 B). The band at 36 kDa in lanes 3 and 5 is PNGase F. Cats 249 and 250 were diagnosed at birth by the presence of nonstaining eosinophils on dried blood films. Diagnosis was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction analysis, which indicated both cats were homozygous for the severe L476P mutation (17Yogalingam G. Litjens T. Bielicki J. Crawley A.C. Muller V.

Throughout therapy, the persistence of heavy neutrophil granulation, nonstaining eosinophils, and vacuolated lymphocytes in blood was noted. Injections of enzyme were tolerated well by both cats, and neither showed any adverse reactions typical of anaphylaxis at any stage of therapy. Throughout the course of therapy, they progressively gained weight, cat 249 being at the top end of the range for normal cats and cat 250 at the lower end (Table I). The two cats were very active and playful; however, mild gait changes were observed in cat 250 in the last 2 weeks of therapy. No hind limb neurological deficits were detected in either cat. After approximately 3 months of age, untreated MPS VI cats exhibited decreased levels of activity and had a high incidence of hind limb neurological deficits. Mild corneal clouding was present in both, and cat 250 had very mild kyphosis of the thoracolumbar spine. Both cats were otherwise difficult to distinguish physically from age-matched normal controls.Table IBody weight (grams) of male MPS VI cats undergoing ERT compared with untreated male MPS VI and normal male control cats age 90, 150, and 170 days90 days150 days170 daysgggNormal1690 ± 38 (n = 13)2955 ± 220 (n = 5)3422 ± 215 (n = 15)MPS VI (no ERT)1472 ± 223 (n = 10)2114 ± 259 (n = 10)2305 ± 292 (n = 9)MPS VI (1 mg of rf4S/kg)1976 (2145, 1806) (n = 2)3068 (3403, 2732) (n = 2)3072 (3448, 2696) (n = 2)MPS VI (5 mg of rh4S/kg)1524 ± 158 (n = 3)2744 ± 341 (n = 3)2740 (n = 1)MPS VI (1 mg of rh4S/kg)1446 ± 271 (n = 3)2603 (2855, 2350) (n = 2)2836 (2941, 2731) (n = 2) Open table in a new tab A rapid decrease in total urinary GAG concentration as estimated by the Alcian Blue test was seen i"

Furthermore, because leucine signals to effectors that lie distal to the mammalian target of rapamycin, these downstream factors were selected for study as candidate mediators of amino acid signaling. Using the perfused rat liver as a model system, we observed a 25% stimulation of protein synthesis in response to balanced hyperaminoacidemia, whereas amino acid imbalance due to elevated concentrations of leucine, glutamine, and tyrosine resulted in a protein synthetic depression of roughly 50% compared with normoaminoacidemic controls. The reduction in protein synthesis accompanying amino acid imbalance became manifest at high physiologic concentrations and was dictated by the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of translation initiation factor eIF2B. Paradoxically, this phenomenon occurred concomitantly with assembly of the mRNA cap recognition complex, eIF4F as well as activation of the 70-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase, p70S6k. Dual and reciprocal modulation of eIF4F and eIF2B was leucine-specific because isoleucine, a structural analog, was ineffective in these regards. Thus, we conclude that amino acid imbalance, heralded by leucine, initiates a liver-specific translational failsafe mechanism that deters protein synthesis under unfavorable circumstances despite promotion of the eIF4F complex.

The effects of amino acids are somewhat enigmatic but often involve the interplay of hormones and other factors intrinsic to the cellular environment. Recently, the branched chain amino acid, leucine, has been demonstrated to modulate pathways of signal transduction and may indeed contribute importantly to the cellular interpretation of integrated signals. With regard to protein homeostasis, several reports now exist supporting the hypothesis that leucine impacts protein turnover through mechanisms beyond those of protein synthetic substrates (1Harper A.E. Miller R.H. Block K.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1984; 4: 409-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 2Smith R. Elia M. Proc. Nutr.

Kadowaki M. Wert Jr., J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16322-16327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mortimore G.E. Poso A.R. Lardeux B. Diab. Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 49-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the amino acids leucine, glutamine, and tyrosine, individually as well as cooperatively and in a manner that is concentration-dependent, attenuate hepatic macroautophagic proteolysis induced by deprivation of amino acids. Furthermore, insulin functions additively and synergistically with these amino acids, thereby enhancing the efficacy of proteolytic inhibition by leucine, glutamine, and/or tyrosine. Inherent in their potency as modulators of protein homeostasis, amino acids generally exert reciprocal control of hepatic protein degradation and synthesis. The latter process is governed primarily at the level of translation initiation through the regulative affinities and activities of several eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs).1 Components of the translational apparatus demonstrated to play particularly important roles include the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B, the eIF4F heterocomplex, and the 70-kDa 40 S ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6k). The guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B, is a heteropentameric enzyme that performs a function critical for the successive and cyclic nature of initiation. After a ribosome is loaded onto the mRNA, the initiation complex is disassembled in a process requiring hydrolysis of eIF2-associated GTP. Because the resultant GDP bound to eIF2 dissociates very slowly and because eIF2·GTP is necessary for recruitment of Met-tRNAi, the eIF2B-catalyzed exchange of eIF2-bound GDP for GTP is essential for ternary complex formation and subsequent rounds of initiation (6Webb B.L.J. Proud C.G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1127-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The activity of eIF2B is negatively affected by phosphorylation of the α subunit of eIF2, which consequently competitively inhibits eIF2-targeted nucleotide exchange. Also, allosteric-like effects as well as direct phosphorylation of eIF2B are implicated in regulating its activity. Amino acid deprivation has been shown to suppress protein synthesis concomitant with inhibition of eIF2B activity. However, the involvement of the phosphorylation state of eIF2α remains debatable (7Kimball S.R. Horetsky R.L. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30945-30953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 8Rowlands A.G. Montine K.S. Henshaw E.C. Panniers R. Eur. J.

Although contentious, the association of eIF4A (an ATP-dependent RNA helicase), eIF4E (an mRNA cap-binding protein), and eIF4G (a scaffolding protein) has been suggested to be the rate-limiting event in the initiation of translation (10Sonenberg N. Herskey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-269Google Scholar). These factors, collectively referred to as eIF4F, bind to the m7GTP cap structure of mRNA and facilitate the recruitment of other eIFs as well as the 40 S ribosomal subunit, culminating in the formation of the 48 S preinitiation complex. The assembly of eIF4F is determined by the phosphorylation state of a family of competitive inhibitors of eIF4G, the eIF4E binding proteins (4E-BPs). Hypophosphorylated 4E-BPs exhibit strong affinity for eIF4E and as such, restrict access of eIF4G to eIF4E. Thus, aggregation of integral components of the cap-binding holocomplex is hindered. However, phosphorylation on multiple residues neutralizes the inhibitive properties of 4E-BPs and facilitates eIF4E·eIF4G interaction. The signal transduction pathway responsible for 4E-BP phosphorylation is common to p70S6k, a cell cycle-regulated kinase implicated in expression of mRNAs of the TOP (terminal oligopyrimidine) family (11Wang X. Campbell L.E. Miller C.M. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 12Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Deprivation of amino acids results in dephosphosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and p70S6k in several cell types (7Kimball S.R. Horetsky R.L. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30945-30953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 11Wang X. Campbell L.E. Miller C.M. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar); these effects are reversed upon readdition of amino acids, and this reversal is rapamycin-sensitive, underscoring the involvement of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in mediation of these signals. Amino acids influence hepatic protein turnover, at least in part, by reciprocal regulation of protein synthesis and protein degradation. Because a distinct group of amino acids, namely the regulatory group, and in particular, leucine, glutamine, and tyrosine, exert most of the observed inhibition of deprivation-induced proteolysis in the liver, we sought to characterize the modulatory role(s), if any, of these amino acids on hepatic protein synthesis. Furthermore, this study was designed to address the hepatic response to physiological changes in amino acid concentration in an effort to isolate potentially important amino acid signaling events; particularly, those induced by leucine. Thus, the specific effects of leucine, glutamine, and tyrosine on eIF4F assembly, eIF2B activity, p70S6k activation, and the relative contribution of these events in determination of overall protein synthesis was evaluated. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing approximately 100–125 g were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle and were provided food (Harlan-Teklad Rodent Chow) and water ad libitum. ECL detection reagents and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse and donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulins were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were acquired from Bio-Rad. Insulin was purchased from Eli Lilly and Co. Rapamycin was purchased from Calbiochem. Livers were perfused in situessentially as described previously (13Flaim K.E. Peavy D.E. Everson W.V. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2932-2938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Perfusate was delivered at flow rate of 7 ml/min under nonrecirculating conditions. Following an initial 5 min washout, livers were perfused and radiolabeled for 15 min in the presence of 5 mm valine. The amino acid composition differed from that previously reported; the 1× designation is described in the legend of Fig. 1. Addition of this mixture has been shown to yield perfusate concentrations that closely approximate those reported for rat plasma (14Lunn P.G. Whitehead R.G. Baker B.A. Br. J. Nutr. 1976; 36: 219-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid compositions of the perfusate utilized throughout this study were multiples of 1× as described in the figures. Moreover, under some circumstances, 10 nm insulin was added to the perfusing medium. For determination of protein synthesis,l-[3,4-3H]valine (NEN Life Science Products) was added at 1 μCi/ml to the perfusate. Rates of protein synthesis were determined essentially as described previously with slight modification (15Kimball S.R. Jurasinski C.V. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C754-C759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by measuring the incorporation of [3H]valine into newly synthesized protein. Quantitation of the respective factors and complexes were performed essentially as defined elsewhere (16Yoshizawa F. Kimball S.R. Vary T.C. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E814-E820PubMed Google Scholar). eIF4E, 4E-BP1·eIF4E, and eIF4G·eIF4E complexes were immunoprecipitated from 10,000 × g supernatants of whole liver homogenate using a mouse anti-eIF4E monoclonal antibody. The antibody was raised against recombinant human eIF4E as described previously (20Kimball S.R. Everson W.V. Flaim K.E. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C28-C34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody-antigen complex was isolated by incubation with goat anti-mouse Biomag immunoglobulin G beads (PerSeptive Diagnostics). Prior to incubation with antigen-antibody complexes, the beads were washed in 1% nonfat, dry milk in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.5 mm sodium vanadate). The beads were captured using a magnetic stand, washed twice with buffer B, and washed once with buffer B containing 500 mm NaCl rather than 150 mm. Immune complexes bound to the beads were eluted by resuspension of the beads in SDS sample buffer and then boiling for 5 min. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatants were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Separated proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Following transfer, the membranes were incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-eIF4E antibody, a rabbit polyclonal anti-4E-BP1 antibody, or a rabbit polyclonal anti-eIF4G antibody overnight at 4 °C. The immunoblots were then developed using an ECL Western blotting kit as described previously (20Kimball S.R. Everson W.V. Flaim K.E. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C28-C34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitation of the phosphorylation state of 4E-BP1 was carried out exactly as described previously (16Yoshizawa F. Kimball S.R. Vary T.C. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E814-E820PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of 4E-BP1 were collected by immunoprecipitation of 4E-BP1 from 10,000 × gsupernatants of whole liver homogenate. For this purpose a mouse monoclonal anti-4E-BP1 antibody was incubated with the 10,000 ×g supernatant. The immunoprecipitated proteins were collected and separated as outlined above. The migration of 4E-BP1 on SDS-polyacrylamide gels is inversely proportional to the degree of phosphorylation of the protein (17Lin T.-A. Kong X. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 18Haystead T.A.J. Haystead C.M.M. Hu C. Lin T.-A. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23185-23191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, multiple phosphorylation forms were separable following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described above. The proportion of eIF2α in phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms was determined using slab gel isoelectric focusing electrophoresis followed by protein immunoblotting. Aliquots of post-mitochondrial supernatants were heated for 3 min in SDS sample buffer at 100 °C, cooled to room temperature, and then mixed with 0.8 volume of isoelectric focusing gel buffer (0.1 g of dithiothreitol, 0.4 g of CHAPS, 5.4 g of urea, and 1 ml of Ampholytes (pH 3.5–9.5 from Pharmacia/LKB) in 6 ml of water). Proteins were resolved and detected using a rabbit monoclonal anti-eIF2α antibody as described elsewhere (19Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and detected with ECL. Determination of eIF2B activity in liver was performed exactly as outlined elsewhere (20Kimball S.R. Everson W.V. Flaim K.E. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C28-C34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by measuring the rate of exchange of [3H]GDP, which is present in an exogenous eIF2·[3H]GDP complex, for free, nonradiolabeled GDP. Briefly, following excision of the liver, the tissue was rinsed in ice-cold saline, weighed, and homogenized in a Polytron in four volumes of buffer consisting of 20 mmtriethanolamine, pH 7.0, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 150 mm potassium chloride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mmEGTA, and 50 mm β-glycerophosphate. Homogenates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. Supernatants were then assayed for guanine nucleotide exchange activity. Essentially, 35 μl of a prepared binary complex, which was assembled by incubation of purified eIF2 with 1.3 μm[3H]GDP (10.7 Ci/mmol), was combined with a mixture consisting of 35 μl of liver homogenate, 87.5 μl of water, and 140 μl of buffer A (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 209 μmGDP, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm potassium chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). The reaction was initiated by combination of these reactants and transfer to a 30 °C water bath. At five time points (0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 min), a 75-μl aliquot was removed and placed into tubes containing 2.5 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (buffer A devoid of bovine serum albumin). The contents were mixed and immediately filtered through a nitrocellulose filter disc. The guanine nucleotide exchange activity was measured as a decrease in eIF2·[3H]GDP complex bound to the filters. The activity of eIF2Bε kinase(s) was performed as described previously (21Jefferson L.S. Fabian J.R. Kimball S.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) except that 0.5 μg of purified, recombinant eIF2Bε was used as substrate in the reaction instead of the purified eIF2B holoenzyme. The amino acids leucine, glutamine, and tyrosine are known to hinder proteolysis; therefore, the role(s) of these regulatory amino acids in modulating protein synthesis was evaluated in the perfused liver. Perfusion with a complete, 10× amino acid mixture resulted in a 25% elevation in overall protein synthesis compared with livers administered a mixture of amino acids at 1× (Fig. 1 A). Intriguingly, perfusion with an imbalanced amino acid mixture comprised of leucine, glutamine, and tyrosine at 10×, whereas all other amino acids were maintained at 1× depressed protein synthesis by almost 50% relative to control. Thus, whereas heightened levels of a total amino acid mixture had an anabolic effect in the liver, equimolar amounts of the three regulatory amino acids impaired protein synthesis. This regulatory amino acid-mediated phenomenon became manifest at approximately 4× concentrations (Fig. 1 B). Although raising the concentration of leucine, glutamine, and tyrosine to 4× depressed protein synthesis, this hepatic response was exacerbated by a further increment in amino acid concentration to 10×. To determine the mechanism(s) by which leucine, glutamine, and tyrosine affects overall protein synthesis, their influence on particular translational control points were evaluated. Surprisingly, raising the concentration of leucine, glutamine, and tyrosine while maintaining all other amino acids at 1× potently disrupted the inhibitory eIF4E·4E-BP1 complex (Fig. 2 A) concomitant with hyperphosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (Fig. 2 B) and p70S6k (Fig. 2 D). Activation of hyperphosphorylated p70S6k was evidenced by hyperphosphorylation of endogenous S6 with increasing concentration of leucine, glutamine, and tyrosine (data not shown). Furthermore, eIF4E preferentially associated with eIF4G under these conditions (Fig. 2 C). Although doubling the concentrations of the regulatory amino acids (that is, 2×) relative to others exerted little effect on these factors, the phosphorylation states of 4E-BP1 and p70S6k were marked enhanced at 4×. Collectively, these results suggest that elevations in circulating levels of leucine, glutamine, and tyrosine above 2× promote assembly of eIF4F and activation of p70S6k despite a simultaneous concentration-dependent inhibition of global translation. Insulin potently modulates the phosphorylation states and activities of components of the eIF4F system as well as p70S6k (15Kimball S.R. Jurasinski C.V. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C754-C759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Xu G. Marshall C.A. Lin T.-A. Kwon G. Munivenkatappa R.B. Hill J.R. Lawrence Jr., J.C. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1996; 270: C705-C709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to characterize the role of insulin on these processes under conditions of mild amino acid imbalance. However, in the presence of either 0.5× (which was not statistically different from 1×; not shown) or 2× concentrations of leucine, glutamine, and tyrosine, insulin was without effect on the liver's protein synthetic response (Fig. 3 A). Whereas it appears that, in the hepatocyte, the anabolic effects of insulin are secondary to those of amino acids, insulin and amino acids synergistically promote assembly of eIF4F and activation of p70S6k (12Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar, 24Patti M.-E. Brambilla E. Luzi L. Landaker E.J. Kahn R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings in the perfused liver corroborate these reports. In combination with insulin, the three regulatory amino acids additively promoted the disunion of the eIF4E·4E-BP1 complex and the association of eIF4E with eIF4G (Fig. 3,B and C). Although phosphorylation of p70S6k was enhanced slightly in the presence of insulin at 0.5× leucine, glutamine, and tyrosine, an additive influence of insulin was masked at higher amino acid concentrations perhaps because p70S6k was maximally activated in the presence of 2× amino acids (Fig. 3 D). In essence, insulin promoted eIF4F assembly within the physiologic realm but remained an impotent determinant of global protein synthesis. Proteolytic studies conducted in perfused rat liver have revealed that of the seven individual amino acids with inherent regulatory properties, macroautophagic proteolytic inhibition by leucine was unrivaled, although glutamine and tyrosine enhanced this inhibition when added in combination (25Mortimore G.E. Kadowaki M. Ciechanover A.J. Schwartz A.L. Cellular Proteolytic Systems. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1994: 65-87Google Scholar, 26Miotto G. Venerando R Khurana K.K. Siliprandi N. Mortimore G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22066-22072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These three amino acids appear to reciprocally modulate autophagic proteolysis and the signal transduction pathway(s) leading to eIF4F complex formation and activation of p70S6k. Therefore, the contribution of leucine to the activating properties of the three regulatory amino acids was examined in the context of eIF4F assembly and p70S6k activation. As shown previously, concentrations of the regulatory amino acid trio mimicking the upper physiologic threshold (that is, 4×) inhibited hepatic protein synthetic activity approximately 25% (Fig. 4 A). However, replacing leucine with equivalent amounts of the structurally similar BCAA, isoleucine, prevented the observed defect in protein synthesis. Furthermore, a perfusate containing 4× leucine elicited a synthetic response intermediate between that observed with a complete, 1× mixture of amino acids and that of 4× leucine, glutamine, and tyrosine. These data suggest not only that these phenomena are leucine-specific but also that glutamine and tyrosine are only marginally influential in the absence of leucine. Leucine, glutamine, and tyrosine, when present at 4× concentrations, effectively destabilized the eIF4E·4E-BP1 complex (Fig. 4 B). However, substitution of leucine with isoleucine in the perfusate was virtually without effect on the stability of the complex, implying that leucine is required for maximal effect. Moreover, leucine appears to play a dominant role in this process because leucine alone nearly reduplicated the uncoupling of eIF4E·4E-BP1 observed with leucine, glutamine, and tyrosine. Furthermore, eIF4E and eIF4G were conjoined in the presence of the three regulatory amino acids, whereas exchange of leucine with isoleucine in the perfusing medium attenuated formation of this complex (Fig. 4 C). Again, leucine alone harbored the bulk of the influence of the regulatory triplet. Finally, optimal hyperphosphorylation of p70S6k was achieved in the presence of leucine, glutamine, and tyrosine, whereas the combination of isoleucine, glutamine, and tyrosine produced a pattern of phosphorylation similar to that of the control amino acid mixture (Fig. 4 D). Phosphorylation of p70S6k by leucine alone was interjacent to the cumulative effect of leucine, glutamine, and tyrosine and that of control. Thus, it appears that the influences of the three regulatory amino acids seen here are largely attributable to the weighty contribution(s) of leucine. However, the effect of leucine on the phosphorylation states of both 4E-BP1 and p70S6k, although augmented, remained submaximal, suggesting that the presence of glutamine and tyrosine serves to enhance these leucine-induced responses. Alterations in eIF4F complex assembly and/or eIF2B activity are often sufficient to account for corresponding changes in total protein synthesis. Because, in this inquiry, protein synthesis and regulatory amino acid concentrations were inversely correlated, and the diminution of total protein synthetic activity was independent of eIF4F assembly, an examination of the activity of eIF2B was undertaken. The guanine nucleotide exchange activity of eIF2B was inversely related to ambient concentrations of leucine, glutamine, and tyrosine. In fact, the percentage of decline in eIF2B activity virtually mirrored the depression in protein synthesis observed at identical regulatory amino acid concentrations (c.f. Fig. 1 B and Fig. 5 A) and was independent of modified expression of eIF2B subunits (data not shown). Hence, the dose-dependent attenuation of eIF2·GTP regeneration was sufficient to account for the suppression of global protein synthesis conduced by leucine, glutamine, and tyrosine. The mechanism triggering these changes in the exchange activity of eIF2B was not attributable to phosphorylation of eIF2α because the proportion of the phosphorylated species did not change appreciably as a function of regulatory amino acid concentration (data not shown). As expected, these changes in eIF2B activation were dictated by the superior influence of leucine. The rate of guanine nucleotide exchange diminished in the presence of a 4× mixture of leucine, glutamine, and tyrosine relative to that of a complete, 1× mixture (Fig. 5 B). Not unexpectedly, the catalytic activity of eIF2B was unaffected when isoleucine was substituted for leucine in the perfusing medium. Once again, however, the observed leucine-specific depression in eIF2B activity was independent of a change in eIF2α phosphorylation (Fig. 5 C). Taken together, the findings not only demonstrate that leucine, glutamine, and tyrosine, when present at concentrations of 4×, minimize the rate of eIF2B-mediated guanine nucleotide exchange, but also that leucine is indispensible for this effect. Because substantial evidence has accumulated to place mTOR downstream of amino acid-induced signals, we sought to address the requirement of mTOR as a mediator of translational regulation by leucine, glutamine, and tyrosine. Rapamycin is a macrolide with immunosuppressive properties that binds with high affinity to endogenous FK506-binding proteins. Although several members of this protein family have been demonstrated to interact with rapamycin, only the FK506-binding protein 12·rapamycin complex directly interacts and thereby inhibits the kinase activity associated with or intrinsic to mTOR. Thus, rapamycin has proven to be a powerful agent in elucidation of signal transduction pathways downstream of mTOR. Addition of this compound to the perfusing medium had little effect under basal, normoacidemic conditions, suggesting that at concentrations of 1×, the eIF4 system and p70S6k are largely inactive (Fig. 6). However, whereas 10× concentrations of leucine, glutamine, and tyrosine robustly induced the appearance of 4E-BP1-γ (Fig. 6 B) as well as slower electrophoretic species of p70S6k (Fig. 6 D), rapamycin completely abolished the"

In this study, transgenic mice overexpressing core 2 GlcNAc-T with severe increase in cardiac core 2 GlcNAc-T activities were normal at birth but showed progressive and significant cardiac hypertrophy at 6 months of age. The heart of transgenic mice showed elevation of sialylated O-glycan and increases of c-fos gene expression and AP-1 activity, which are characteristics of cardiac stress. Furthermore, transfection of PC12 cells with core 2 GlcNAc-T also induced c-fos promoter activation, mitogen activated-protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation, Trk receptor glycosylation, and cell differentiation. These results suggested a novel role for core 2 GlcNAc-T in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy and modulation of the MAP kinase pathway in the heart.-Koya, D., Dennis, J. W., Warren, C.

The13C-labeling patterns of acetyl-CoA, pyruvate, and phosphoenolpyruvate in intermediary metabolism were reconstructed from the 13C NMR data of biosynthetic amino acids (leucine, alanine, phenylalanine) and were used to predict hypothetical labeling patterns for isopentenyl pyrophosphate formed via the mevalonate pathway and the deoxyxylulose pathway. The labeling patterns observed for the neoverrucosane diterpene were consistent with the intermediate formation of geranyllinaloyl pyrophosphate assembled from dimethylallyl pyrophosphate and three molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate generated predominantly or entirely via 1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate. The experimental data can be integrated into a detailed biosynthetic scheme involving a 1,5-hydride shift.

Processing of antigenic peptides from cytosolic or nuclear proteins has been extensively studied (for review, see Ref. 1Groettrup M. Soza A. Kuckelhorn U. Kloetzel P.-M. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 429-435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). It begins in the cytosol with the breakdown of ubiquitinated proteins by the proteasome and possibly by nonproteasomal cytosolic proteases (2Anton L. Snyder H. Bennink J. Vinitsky A. Orlowski M.

Science. 1999; 283: 978-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Peptides generated by this degradation step are then translocated via peptide-specific transporters (TAP) into the ER, where association with newly synthesized MHC class I (5Elliott T. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 47-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, eventually, further trimming of peptides (6Snyder H.L. Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. J. Exp.

In contrast, the mechanisms by which MHC-restricted antigenic peptides are generated from transmembrane or secreted glycoproteins, which are co-translationally translocated into the ER during biosynthesis, are less understood; however, they frequently represent a source of antigenic peptides (8Rammensee H.G. Friede T. Stevanovic S. Immunogenetics. 1995; 41: 178-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). The observation that, in most cases, their processing requires both proteasome activity and TAP-dependent translocation into the ER suggests that at least a certain amount of the glycoprotein may have access to the cytosol (9Ferris R.L.

It is thus of particular interest to study the processing from viral glycoproteins of peptides bearing a glycosylation motif (N-X-S/T, where X is any amino acid except P). In theory, such peptides can exist in diverse forms depending on their post-translational state: non-glycosylated,N-glycosylated, or de-N-glycosylated. These forms are characterized, respectively, by the presence at the level of the N-X-S/T motif of an unmodified N, a glycan-branched N or a D (as the result of a peptide:N-glycanase activity that provokes deamidation of the side chain (14Suzuki T. Seko A. Kitajima K. Knoue Y. Inoue S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17611-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Further, the enzymatic activities required for N-glycosylation (N-glycosyltransferases) and de-N-glycosylation (peptide:N-glycanase) are thought to be located in the ER/Golgi (15Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3791) Google Scholar) and cytosol/nucleus (14Suzuki T. Seko A. Kitajima K. Knoue Y. Inoue S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17611-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Infection of H-2b mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) generates a vigorous CD8+ CTL response against three well defined H-2Db-restricted epitopes located in the glyco- (GP1 and GP2) and nucleo- (NP) proteins (16Schulz M.

By screening these viral proteins for potential new epitopes, the LCMV GP92–101 (CSANNSHHYI) peptide was identified first as a strong H-2Db binder (20Hudrisier D. Mazarguil H. Laval F.

Virol. 1995; 69: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and later as a non-immunodominant LCMV epitope (22van der Most R. Murali-Krishna K. Whitton L. Oseroff C. Alexander J. Southwood S. Sidney J. Chesnut R. Sette A. Ahmed R. Virology. 1998; 240: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the central core motif GP95–97 of this antigen represents one of the glycosylation motifs, -NXS/T-, known to be N-glycosylated in the mature LCMV GP1 glycoprotein (23Wright K.E. Spiro R.C. Burns J.W. Buchmeier M.J. Virology. 1990; 177: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These observations at both the structural and functional levels make this peptide a good model for studying the effect of post-translational modification on antigen processing and presentation, and the consequences it may have for the antiviral CTL response. This study aimed: (i) to analyze the effect of post-translational modification (N-glycosylation and de-N-glycosylation) on the MHC binding and CTL activation properties of LCMV GP92–101 and (ii) to identify the viral sequence(s) naturally processed and presented to CTLs at the surface of LCMV-infected cells. Binding studies performed with synthetic peptides corresponding to the three possible forms of GP92–101 indicated that neither N-glycosylation nor de-N-glycosylation affected the H-2Db-binding affinity of GP92–101. All three forms of the peptide were immunogenic and led to the generation of GP92–101-specific CTLs. Analysis of peptides eluted from the surface of LCMV-infected cells by a cytolytic assay coupled to HPLC led to the identification of both non-glycosylated (N95) and de-N-glycosylated sequences (D95) naturally presented at the surface of infected cells. The N-glycosylated (GlcNac-N95) form remained undetectable. Additionally, immunoreactive species of higher retention time derived from the N95 peptide were also observed, likely corresponding to oxidized forms of C92. The physiological relevance of this remains to be determined. Overall, the data presented here demonstrate for the first time that both genetically encoded and post-translationally modified forms of a viral glycopeptide may co-exist at the surface of virus-infected cells as a result of distinct, non-mutually exclusive processing pathways that can operate simultaneously. CTL were obtained from C57BL/6 mice immunized subcutaneously at the base of the tail with 50–100 μg of the indicated peptides mixed with 5 μg of P30 T-helper epitope from tetanus toxoid (24Widmann C. Romero P. Maryanski J.L. Corradin G. Valmori D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 155: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. After 1 week, draining lymph nodes were removed and CTL were restimulated weekly with irradiated (2,500 rads) C57BL/6 splenocytes and irradiated (10,000 rads) peptide-pulsed (1 μm) RMA cells in the presence of 30 UI/ml IL2 (EL4 supernatant). Murine H-2bmutant RMA-S cells and human T2 cells transfected with H-2Db (T2-Db) were used in binding experiments. The murine H-2b cell lines RMA and MC57 were used inin vitro cytotoxicity assays. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (RMA, RMA-S, MC57) or Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (T2-Db) containing 5% bovine serum, l-glutamine (2 mm) and antibiotics (10 units/ml penicillin and 10 μg/ml streptomycin). Geneticin (400 μg/ml) was added to Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium to maintain selection of T2-Db cells. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus Armstrong strain (LCMV Arm) was used to infect mice or cells. Peptides were synthesized on an automated peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems 430A) by the solid-phase method using Fmoc chemistry. The glycopeptide analogue was obtained by using Fmoc-Asn(Ac3AcNH-βGlc)-OH, a commercially available derivative of Asn bearing anN-acetyl-d-glucosamine moiety (Novabiochem). After standard protocols for solid phase synthesis, cleavage, and deprotection, the glycopeptide was de-O-acetylated with 0.1m sodium hydroxide. Peptides were purified by HPLC on a RP300-C8 reversed-phase column (Brownlee Lab) and their identity confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Binding studies were performed as described previously (20Hudrisier D. Mazarguil H. Laval F. Oldstone M.B.A. Gairin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17829-17836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, T2-Db cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were incubated in U-bottomed 96-well plates for 75 min at 37 °C with 100 nmH-2Db-restricted fluorescent probe FITC-KAIENAEAL (25Hudrisier D. Mazarguil H. Oldstone M.B.A. Gairin J.E. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and increasing concentrations (10−10 to 10−4m) of unlabeled competitors. Cells were then washed twice with bovine serum albumin-PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry. Total and nonspecific binding were measured in the absence or presence of 1 mm unlabeled LCMV NP396–404. Specific binding to H-2Db was defined as the difference between the total and nonspecific binding. Percentage (%) of binding inhibition was calculated as 100 × {1 − (fluorescence intensity (FI) in the presence of competitor − FI, nonspecific binding/FI, specific binding)}. IC50 represents the peptide concentration inhibiting 50% of the specific binding of the fluorescent probe. MC57 (H-2b) and control Balb/c (H-2d) cell lines (1–2 × 109 cells) were infected or not with LCMV Arm for 48 h. Cells were washed three times in PBS, then resuspended in 0.1 m citrate/phosphate buffer at pH 3.0 for 2 min. The eluted material was desalted on a Sep-Pak column (Waters) according to the manufacturer's instructions, then transferred onto a Centricon 10 (Amicon) and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 90 min at 4 °C. Material less than 10 kDa was vacuum-concentrated and then resuspended in 20 μl of 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptide separation was carried out on a reversed-phase C18 column (7 μm, 2.1 × 100 mm, Aquapore, Brownlee) using the Waters 600S controller system. Samples (10 μl) were injected and separated using either system I (5–60% B in 60 min) or system II (6–15% B in 30 min, then 15–57% B in 30 min). Solution A was 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O, and solution B was 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in CH3CN (flow rate: 400 μl/min). Fractions (200 μl) were collected in U-bottomed 96-well plates, lyophilized, reconstituted in PBS, and stored at −80 °C before analysis. In some cases, the eluted pool was treated with DTT (1 mm DTT in 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 8.5, under N2 overnight at room temperature) or Endo H (50 milliunits/ml, pH 5.5, 24 h at 37 °C) before separation. RMA cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in medium containing 10-fold dilutions of peptides. MC57 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 2 with LCMV Arm 48 h prior the assay. Peptide-pulsed and control RMA cells, and LCMV-infected and uninfected MC57 cells were 51Cr labeled and used as targets (5 × 103/well) in chromium release assays. Effector CTL were added at 1.5 × 104/well or at the indicated E/T ratio. The51Cr content of supernatants was determined after 4 h of incubation at 37 °C. The specific lysis was calculated as 100 × [(experimental − spontaneous release)/(total − spontaneous release)]. Three synthetic peptides corresponding to the non-glycosylated (N95),N-glycosylated ((GlcNac)-N95) and de-N-glycosylated (D95) forms of GP92–101 were synthesized (Table I). TheN-acetyl-d-glucosamine moiety was chosen to mimic the glycosylated form because: (i) it is the first carbohydrate attached to N and is common to all eukaryotic glycosylation processes and (ii) it corresponds to the minimal sugar moiety left after Endo H digestion of glycosylated side chains, therefore allowing the detection of natural species. Peptide binding affinities for H-2Db were measured in a MHC binding competition assay on T2-Db cells (25Hudrisier D. Mazarguil H. Oldstone M.B.A. Gairin J.E. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, N95 bound to H-2Db with a high affinity (IC50 in the 10 nm range), in agreement with previous observations (20Hudrisier D. Mazarguil H. Laval F. Oldstone M.B.A. Gairin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17829-17836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The two modified analogues, (GlcNac)-N95 and D95, bound efficiently to T2-Db cells with dose-response curves superimposable on that of the unmodified N95, thus indicating that all three forms of GP92–101 can potentially be presented by H-2Db at the surface of LCMV-infected cells expressing H-2Db.Table IIdentification and physicochemical properties of the different synthetic forms of the non-immunodominant epitope GP92–101 of LCMV used in this studyPeptideFormSequenceCellular statusaThe putative status of the corresponding endogenous sequence of the epitope in the LCMV infected cells is indicated.

Open table in a new tab C57BL/6 mice were immunized subcutaneously at the base of the tail with N95, (GlcNac)-N95, and D95 in the presence of the P30 helper epitope and incomplete Freund's adjuvant. After 2 weeks of in vitro restimulation, CTL were obtained against each of the three peptides, indicating that they are all immunogenic. As shown in Fig. 2(panel A), CTL generated against N95 killed target cells coated with the immunizing peptide with a half-maximal lysis at concentrations in the 10−9 to 10−10m range. These CTL also recognized (GlcNac)-N95 and D95, but at very different concentrations. (GlcNac)-N95 recognition required a concentration about 2 logs higher, and the maximal lysis plateau reached was lower than that for N95, whereas D95 was ∼100-fold more potent than N95. CTL generated against (GlcNac)-N95 (panel B) and D95 (panel C) showed a 10-fold higher efficacy (half-maximal lysis in the range of 10−11to 10−10m range) and were fully specific for the immunizing peptide since no (or very weak) cross-reactivity with the other forms of GP92–101 was observed. The response generated against each form of the LCMV GP92–101 was peptide-specific since none of the CTLs recognized the unrelated GP33–41 sequence of the LCMV GP1 immunodominant epitope, even at the highest concentration tested (10−6m). Altogether, these results show that the three different forms of GP92–101 may represent distinct antigens. Obtention of these anti-GP92–101 CTLs then allowed us to search for the presence of GP92–101 sequence(s) naturally processed and presented at the surface of LCMV-infected cells. The cytolytic activity of the anti-GP92–101 was tested against LCMV-infected or uninfected MC57 target cells. Fig. 3 shows that CTL generated against N95 (panel A) and D95 (panel C) but not (GlcNac)-N95 (panel B) were able to specifically lyse LCMV-infected cells, demonstrating that GP92–101 is naturally presented at the surface of LCMV-infected cells. This result is in agreement with the finding that anti-GP92–101-specific CTL are present in secondary antiviral CTL obtained after acute infection of C57BL/6 mice with LCMV (22van der Most R.

Given the pattern of reactivity of N95- and D95-specific CTL (see Fig. 1 A), one can deduce that at least the post-translationally modified form (D95) of LCMV GP92–101 is naturally presented at the surface of LCMV-infected cells. Since LCMV-infected cells were recognized and lysed by anti-LCMV GP92–101 CTLs, peptides were extracted from the surface of LCMV-infected (or as a control, uninfected MC57 cells), separated by HPLC (Fig. 4,panel A) and analyzed in cytotoxicity assays (Fig. 4, panel B), in order to characterize further which form(s) of LCMV GP92–101 was(were) endogenously presented. In a first step, CTL generated against N95 were used since they recognized all forms of GP92–101. As shown in Fig. 4 (panel B), these CTL killed H-2b target cells coated with material eluted from LCMV-infected but not uninfected MC57 cells. Two peaks of activity corresponding to fractions 31–34 (retention time: 15–16.5 min) and to fractions 36–37 (retention time: 17.5–18.0 min) were obtained, indicating that different forms of GP92–101 were processed in LCMV-infected cells and presented at their surface. N95-specific CTL did not recognize peptides eluted from LCMV-infected or uninfected Balb/c (H-2d) cells in control experiments (data not shown). In a second step, fractions 20–50 from an independent experiment were analyzed with either N95- or D95-specific CTL, both of which recognized LCMV-infected cells. As shown in Fig. 5(panels A and B), a different profile of activity was observed with the two CTL lines. The D95-specific CTL activity profile (panel B) was very clear and restricted to fraction 32, which, as indicated by the arrow, corresponds to the retention time of the synthetic D95 peptide. This result confirms unambiguously that the D95 form of GP92–101 is present at the surface of LCMV-infected cells. The activity profile obtained with N95-specific CTL (panel A) was more complex and showed that other forms of GP92–101 were present that were selectively recognized by N95-specific CTL but not D95-specific CTL. Since the poor separation of the N95 and D95 forms obtained with the HPLC system I (see Table I) did not allow unambiguous identification of the peptide(s) present in the main peak recognized by anti-N95 CTL (fractions 31–34, Fig. 5 A), we set up an optimized gradient (system II) allowing a better separation of N95 and D95 (see Table I). As shown in Fig. 6, endogenous viral material was then clearly detected in fractions 30–31 by anti-N95 CTL but not by anti-D95 CTL. These fractions corresponded to the retention time of synthetic N95 identified by UV detection and mass spectrometry analysis in the same experimental conditions (Table I). Fractions 32–34 recognized by the two CTL lines contained the D95 form, as expected from results presented above and in Table I. Thus both the N95 and D95 forms of GP92–101 are naturally found at the surface of LCMV-infected H-2b cells. Fractions 36–37 recognized by N95-specific CTL do not co-migrate with any of the synthetic peptides corresponding to post-translationally modified analogs of GP92–101. We reasoned that this peak could correspond to a N-glycosylated form of GP92–101 different from the synthetic (GlcNac)-N95 modified peptide and thus not recognized by (GlcNac)-N95-specific CTL. To investigate this possibility, we treated the pool of eluted peptides with Endo H, which generates the (GlcNac)-N form from complex glycans attached to N, before performing the assay. Despite this treatment, none of the fractions was recognized by (GlcNac)-N95-specific CTL (shown in Fig. 7), indicating that noN-glycosylated form of GP92–101 was detectable among the eluted peptides. The synthetic control (GlcNac)-N95 peptide was recognized by specific CTL in fractions corresponding to the expected retention time. The presence of a cysteinyl residue (C92) in the GP92–101 sequence may lead to oxidized species as a result of either antigen processing or storage of peptide eluates (27Meadows L. Wang W. den Haan J.M. Blokland E. Reinhardus C. Drijfhout J.W. Shabanowitz J. Pierce R. Agulnik A.I. Bishop C.E. Hunt D.F. Goulmy E. Engelhard V.H. Immunity. 1997; 6: 273-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8, DTT treatment of peptide eluate abrogated the CTL activity against fractions 36–40. To support this observation, we found that the dimerized N95 form of the GP92–101 synthetic peptide which eluted at an expected higher retention time (Table I) was still efficiently recognized by N95-specific CTL (data not shown). Thus, the DTT-reducible, N95-specific immunoreactivity found in fractions 36–40 reflects the presence within the peptide eluate of chemically modified N95 forms of LCMV GP92–101 which likely correspond to oxidized C92 derivatives. Why oxidation of C92 only affected N95 and not D95 is unknown. Altogether our results indicate that GP92–101 is present at the surface of infected cells as at least two different endogenously processed forms, a non-glycosylated one and a de-N-glycosylated one. A third one corresponding to a chemical modification of C92, whose natural occurrence remains to be established, was also detected. In this study, we demonstrate, using the non-immunodominant H-2Db-restricted LCMV epitope GP92–101, that MHC class I-restricted antigens that bear a glycosylation motif -NXS- may be processed from a viral glycoprotein and presented at the surface of infected cells as at least two distinct sequences, genetically encoded (non-glycosylated) and post-translationally modified (de-N-glycosylated). To our knowledge, such a dual processing and presentation pathway has never been observed before. Very few (three) examples of naturally processed sequences bearing a glycosylation motif have been reported so far, consisting in each case of only one exclusive form, either non-glycosylated (28Ferris R.L. Buck C. Hammond S.A. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Takiguchi M. Igarashi Y. Ichikawa Y. Siliciano R.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 834-840PubMed Google Scholar) or de-N-glycosylated (10Selby M. Erickson A. Dong C. Cooper S. Parham P. Houghton M. Walker C.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 669-676PubMed Google Scholar, 29Skipper J.C.A. Hendrickson R.C. Gulden P.H. Brichard V. VanPel A. Chen Y. Shabanowitz J. Wolfel T. Slinguff C.L.J. Boon T. Hunt D.F. Engelhard V.H. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). How may the two presentation pathways of LCMV GP92–101 be achieved? For the de-N-glycosylated form, processing might involve translation in the ER, export of full-length glycoprotein to the cytosol and transport of processed peptides by TAP for MHC binding, as shown for an HLA-A2 tyrosinase epitope (11Mosse C.A. Meadows L. Luckey C.J. Kittlesen D.J. Huczko E.L. Slingluff C.L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Engelhard V.H. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Proteasomal degradation of glycoproteins requires their retro-transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (where glycosylation occurs) to the cytosol (where both deglycosylation and degradation are achieved) (30Wiertz Z.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 31Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). With regard to the non-glycosylated form, it is difficult to understand how a non-glycosylated peptide may be processed from the LCMV GP1 glycoprotein itself since all the five glycosylation motifs -NXS/T- of LCMV GP1 are glycosylated in the mature viral glycoprotein (23Wright K.E. Spiro R.C. Burns J.W. Buchmeier M.J. Virology. 1990; 177: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Further, the peptide:N-glycanases known so far, due to their β-aspartyl-glycosylamine hydrolase activity, always convert the glycosylated Asn to Asp and never restore the Asn initially present. One likely explanation is that the non-glycosylated form of LCMV GP92–101 does not originate from GP1 but from LCMV GP-C. The LCMV glycoprotein GP1 is generated, together with GP2, from a post-translational cleavage of a common precursor GP-C. Unglycosylated GP-C is not cleaved (23Wright K.E. Spiro R.C. Burns J.W. Buchmeier M.J. Virology. 1990; 177: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar); one may therefore hypothesize that the non-glycosylated form of GP92–101 originates from unglycosylated, uncleaved GP-C and not from GP1. The non-glycosylated and the de-N-glycosylated forms of GP92–101 would then be generated separately from two different proteins. Two other possibilities can also be proposed (28Ferris R.L. Buck C. Hammond S.A. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Takiguchi M. Igarashi Y. Ichikawa Y. Siliciano R.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 834-840PubMed Google Scholar): (i) some of the glycosylation sites of LCMV GP1 may be randomly left unglycosylated within the viral glycoprotein, or (ii) parts of the glycoprotein may be aberrantly translated on free ribosomes in the cytosol and thus never access the ER. Determination of the relative proportion of the different forms of GP92–101 presented at the surface of infected cells would require highly sensitive detection methods not available in our laboratory. It is expected that the proportion of the different forms we observed would be determined by both (i) the efficacy of the processing pathways involved and (ii) the initial amount of substrate for these different pathways. While the natural occurrence of glycosylated peptides presented by MHC class II molecules to αβTCR has been well documented (32Chicz R. Urban R. Gorga J. Vignali D. Lane W. Strominger J. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 27-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 33Dudler T. Altmann F. Carballido J. Blaser K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the same remains to be demonstrated for classical MHC class I molecules. The presence of the de-N-glycosylated form of GP92–101 clearly indicates that a certain proportion of the peptide has previously been N-glycosylated, yet we were unable to detect any N-glycosylated GP92–101 sequence at the surface of infected cells. However, from our study and others using artificially glycosylated peptides, it is clear that glycopeptides can bind to MHC class I molecules and be immunogenic, indicating that a T cell repertoire exists for specific recognition of class I restricted glycosylated peptides (34Haurum J.S. Arsequell G. Lellouch A.C. Wong S.Y.C. Dwek R.A. McMichael A.J. Elliott T. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 35Haurum J.S. Tan L. Arsequell G. Frodsham P.

Immunity. 1999; 10: 51-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It is thus quite possible that the absence of N-glycosylated peptides naturally presented by classical MHC class I molecules may be due to limitations at the level of the antigen processing pathway. For example, in the cytosol, only peptide:N-glycanase-treated glycoproteins but not untreated glycoproteins are substrates for proteasomal degradation and antigen processing in the ER is blocked as long as glycosylation is not pharmacologically or genetically inhibited (38Wood P. Elliott T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Whether or notO-glycosylated peptides produced in the cytosol can be presented by MHC class I molecules remains to be studied. An oxidized form of the non-glycosylated peptide was also present in our extract. Even though the exact nature of this form remains to be fully characterized, we have shown that it was recognized by anti-N95 CTL but not by anti-95D CTL and that this peptide was absent from DTT-treated samples. It has to be noted that Cys residues can readily be oxidized in biological fluids or during storage of Cys-containing peptides. While in previous reports such a modification was produced during antigen processing (27Meadows L. Wang W. den Haan J.M. Blokland E. Reinhardus C. Drijfhout J.W. Shabanowitz J. Pierce R. Agulnik A.I. Bishop C.E. Hunt D.F. Goulmy E. Engelhard V.H. Immunity. 1997; 6: 273-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 39Chen W. Yewdell J. Levine R. Bennink J. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1757-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we lack evidence that such a mechanism occurs in our case. What may be the physiopathological consequences of processing and presentation of multiple forms of a single antigenic sequence? In terms of MHC presentation, the observation that the high binding affinity of GP92–101 for H-2Db was left unaffected by eitherN-glycosylation or de-N-glycosylation is consistent with previous data showing that position 4 of H-2Db-restricted peptides tolerates a wide variety of substitutions (20Hudrisier D. Mazarguil H. Laval F. Oldstone M.B.A. Gairin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17829-17836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The side chain of the residue at position 4 points out of the H-2Db binding groove and represents a TCR contact residue for most of the known H-2Db-restricted viral epitopes (40Young A.C.M. Zhang W.G. Sacchettini J.C. Nathenson S.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 39-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 41Hudrisier D. Oldstone M.B.A. Gairin J.E.

Paul Sabatier University, Toulouse, France1996Google Scholar). Generation of multiple forms of a peptide that display similar high MHC binding properties but have different TCR activation properties from a single sequence potentially increases the diversity of antigens presented to T cells. Thus, in terms of TCR recognition, N-glycosylation alone or followed by de-N-glycosylation can create distinct epitopes. Indeed, while CTL generated against N95 efficiently recognized both N95 and D95 (the latter even being recognized better than the immunogen), CTL generated against D95 selectively recognized this peptide. Immunization of C57BL/6 mice with N95 induces a protective CTL response against LCMV and splenocytes from LCMV-infected mice can be maintained in culture with N95 pulsed target cells and stained with N95-H-2Dbtetramers (22van der Most R.

Presentation of multiple forms of the same viral antigen should be considered as an advantage for the host in its fight against viral infection. However, the observation that despite the presence of its multiple forms at the surface of LCMV-infected cells, an efficient GP92–101-specific primary CTL response is not observed in LCMV-infected C57BL6 mice against the unmodified N95 form (21Oldstone M.B.A. Lewicki H.

Chesnut R. Sette A. Ahmed R. Virology. 1998; 240: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) or post-translationally modified D95 and (GlcNac)-N95 forms (data not shown), demonstrates that the LCMV GP92–101 remains a non-immunodominant epitope. So, conversely, could processing and presentation of multiple forms of LCMV GP92–101 be a cause of its non-immunodominance? The observation that the protective capacity of CTL is influenced by the diversity of viral peptides generated within infected cells (43Gallimore A. Hombach J. Dumrese T. Rammensee H.G. Zinkernagel R.M. Hengartner H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 3301-3311Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) would support this latter hypothesis. Another attractive and elegant hypothesis is that non-immunodominance may result from TCR antagonism naturally generated by multiple antigen processing from the same sequence. Both we and others have shown that altered peptide ligands resulting from mutation of an antigenic peptide can differentially affect TCR recognition, provoking partial agonism or antagonism (44Hudrisier D.

Virology. 1997; 234: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Further, it has recently been shown that antigen processing could generate both stimulatory and antagonist peptides from a single class II model epitope, which may have important implications for T cell immunoregulation (47Carson R. Desai D. Vignali K. Vignali D. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1-4PubMed Google Scholar). These different hypotheses are currently under investigation in our laboratory.

The multisubunit IκB kinase (msIKK) responsible for this phosphorylation contains two catalytic subunits, termed IKK-1 and IKK-2. Using recombinant IKK-2, a kinetic pattern consistent with a random, sequential binding mechanism was observed with the use of a peptide corresponding to amino acids 26–42 of IκB-α. Values of 313 μm, 15.5 μm, and 1.7 min−1 were obtained forK peptide, K ATP, andk cat, respectively. The value of α, a factor by which binding of one substrate changes the dissociation constant for the other substrate, was determined to be 0.2. Interestingly, the recombinant IKK-1 subunit gave similar values for α andK ATP, but values of 1950 μm and 0.016 min−1 were calculated forK peptide and k cat, respectively. This suggests that the IKK-2 catalytic subunit provides nearly all of the catalytic activity of the msIKK complex with the IKK-1 subunit providing little contribution to catalysis. Using peptides corresponding to different regions of IκB-α within amino acids 21–47, it was shown that amino acids 31–37 provide most binding interactions (−4.7 kcal/mol of binding free energy) of the full-length IκB-α (−7.9 kcal/mol) with the IKK-2. This is consistent with the observation that IKK-2 is able to phosphorylate the IκB-β and IκB-ε proteins, which have consensus phosphorylation sites nearly identical to that of amino acids 31–37 of IκB-α. A peptide corresponding to amino acids 279–303 in the C-terminal domain of IκB-α was unable to activate IKK-2 to phosphorylate an N-terminal peptide, which is in contrast to the results observed with the msIKK. Moreover, the IKK-2 catalyzes the phosphorylation of the full-length IκB-α and the amino acid 26–42 peptide with nearly equal efficiency, while the msIKK catalyzes the phosphorylation of the full-length IκB-α 25,000 times more efficiently than the 26–42 peptide.

Demonstration that IKK is the kinase involved in the signal-inducible degradation of IκB-α was accomplished by both antisense inhibition of IKK-1 and the use of dominant-negative, catalytically inactive mutants of IKK-1 and IKK-2 (12DiDonato J.A.

The signal-induced activation of IKK appears to proceed through phosphorylation of the IKK-1 and/or IKK-2 subunits by a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (such as MEKK1 or NIK), which greatly enhances the enzymatic activity (18Nakano H. Shindo M. Sakon S. Hishinaka S. Mihara M. Yagita H. Okumura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3537-3542Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the multisubunit IKK recognizes and is stimulated by elements of the C terminus of IκBα (19Burke J.R. Miller K.R. Wood M.K. Meyers C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12041-12046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this paper we provide a detailed characterization of the IKK-1 and IKK-2 catalytic subunits using peptides corresponding to the N- and C-terminal sequences of IκB proteins as probes. Interestingly, amino acids 31–37 of IκB-α provide for most of the binding free energy to the catalytic subunits, and regions outside of amino acids 21–47 provide for little interactions. Moreover, considerably greater binding interactions between the C terminus of IκB-α and the regulatory subunits of the msIKK appear to be responsible for the activation of the multisubunit complex to accelerate catalysis by many orders of magnitude. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-IκBα was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and cleaved with thrombin to remove the GST tag. [33P]ATP (1000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Peptides corresponding to regions of IκB-α, IκB-β, and IκB-ε were synthesized on Fmoc-Knorr amide resin (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl-Knorr amide-resin; Midwest Biotech, Fishers, IN) with a model 433A synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and theFastMoc chemistry protocol (0.25 mmol scale) supplied with the instrument. Amino acids were double-coupled as their N-α-Fmoc- derivatives and reactive side chains were protected as follows: Asp and Glu, t-butyl ester; Ser and Thr, t-butyl ether; His, triphenylmethyl; Lys, t-butyloxycarbonyl; Arg, pentamethylchroman-sulfonyl; Cys, triphenylmethyl; and Tyr,t-butyl ether. After the final double-coupling cycle, the N-terminal Fmoc group was removed by the two-step treatment with piperidine in N-methylpyrrolidone described by the manufacturer. The N-terminal free amines were then treated with 10% acetic anhydride, 5% diisopropylamine inN-methylpyrrolidone to yield theN-acetyl-derivative. The protected peptidyl-resins were simultaneously deprotected and removed from the resin by standard methods, except for peptides IκB-α 26–42 and 279–303, which were extracted as crude products from the resin by a modified procedure described previously (19Burke J.R. Miller K.R. Wood M.K. Meyers C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12041-12046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The lyophilized peptides were purified on C18 to apparent homogeneity, as judged by reverse phase-HPLC analysis. Predicted peptide molecular weights were verified by electrospray mass spectrometry. The full-length coding region of IKK-1 and IKK-2 were cloned using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with mRNA from HeLa cells as a template. Identity was confirmed by sequencing. For the protein expression the coding region was cloned into pBMS-1, a derivative of pVL1393 that has the GST coding sequence inserted into theBamHI site of the polylinker followed by a thrombin protease site and by the pVL1393 polylinker with the BamHI site restored. For this purpose, the initiation ATG of the kinases was replaced by GTG preventing potential internal translation initiation. Polymerase chain reaction primers were as follows for IKKA: TCTCATGAATTCCGGTGGAGCGGCCCCCGG and TCATATGCGGCCGCTCATTCTGTTAACCAACTCCAATCAAG, cloned into EcoRI/NotI, and for IKKB: TCTTATTCTAGAGTGAGCTGGTCACCTTCCCTGACAACG and TCTATAGCGGCCGCGGTCGAGTCCCCCACATCATGAGG, cloned into the XbaI/NotI site of the pBMS-1 vector. Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9; ATCC CRL 1711) and Trichoplusia ni (BTI-Tn5B1–4, High FiveTM; Invitrogen Corp.) cells were grown in suspension cultures at 27 °C in Sf9 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Isolation of recombinant viruses was done as described by Summers and Smith. For the expression of recombinant proteins, High FiveTM cells were grown in 1-liter suspensions and infected in the log phase of growth at a cell density of 1.0 × 106 to 1.5 × 106 cells per ml, using 10 plaque-formung units of virus per cell. From pellets of High Five cells expressing the recombinant GST-fusion proteins, enzyme isolation was accomplished by first lysing a cell pellet in insect cell lysis buffer (PharMingen) for 45 min at 4 °C and then centrifuging the lysate at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Glutathione-agarose beads (PharMingen) were added and allowed to incubate with gentle agitation for 5 min at 4 °C. The beads were then collected by centrifugation, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the GST proteins eluted with 5 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. SDS-polyacryamide gel electrophoresis showed the presence of the desired GST-IKK fusion protein with the only significant contaminant being GST itself. Anti-GST and anti-IKK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) immunoblots were used to verify the identity and relative concentrations of IKK-1 and IKK-2 in these isolated samples. When using peptides as substrates for the IKK-1 or IKK-2, enzymatic assays were performed by adding the enzyme at 30 °C to solutions containing peptide and [33P]ATP (1000 Ci/mmol) in 50 mm Tris·HCl, 5 mm MgCl2 at pH 8. After 60 min, the kinase reactions were quenched by addition of EDTA to a concentration of 10 mm. HPLC analysis was performed as described previously (19Burke J.R. Miller K.R. Wood M.K. Meyers C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12041-12046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the amount of IKK-catalyzed incorporation of 33P into each peptide was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Under these conditions, the degree of phosphorylation of GST-IκBα was linear with time and concentration of enzyme. When using full-length IκB-α (GST-tagged) as substrate, the assay was allowed to proceed for 10 min before quenching with 2× Laemmli sample buffer and heat treatment at 90 °C for 3 min. The samples were then loaded on to 10% Tris-glycine gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). After completion of SDS-polyacryamide gel electrophoresis, gels were dried on a slab gel dryer. The bands were then detected using a 445Si PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), and the radioactivity quantified using the ImageQuant software while employing a mean background correction factor for each 33P-labeled IκB-α band. Radioactive standards were run to calculate the absolute (μCi) amount of radioactivity associated with the bands. There are several kinetic mechanisms that have been described for two substrate enzyme systems. Using a peptide corresponding to amino acids 26–42 of IκB-α as substrate, Fig. 1 shows a Hanes plot of recombinant IKK-2 activity as a function of the concentration of this peptide substrate at different ATP concentrations. The analysis is best fit to a random, sequential binding mechanism where the enzyme binds both substrates prior to product release. This is in contrast to a ping-pong mechanism, where one product is released before the second substrate binds and would give a Hanes plot with lines intersecting at the yaxis (20Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975: 274-291Google Scholar). Verification of a random versus ordered binding mechanism will be shown later. The sequential binding mechanism of human, recombinant IKK-2 is defined in Scheme 1, where K IκBα and αK IκBα are the dissociation constants for IκB-α in the absence and presence, respectively, of ATP bound to the active site; and K ATP and αK ATP are the dissociation constants for ATP in the absence and presence, respectively, of IκB-α bound to the active site. Using a non-linear regression analysis of the data from Fig. 1 (21Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar), values for K IκBα,K ATP, and α were obtained and are shown in Table I. A value of α < 1 demonstrates that the binding of one substrate increases the affinity for the second substrate (20Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975: 274-291Google Scholar). SCHEME 1 Using recombinant IKK-1 as the enzyme, kinetics consistent with random, sequential binding were also obtained (see Fig. 2). However, the N-terminal peptide substrate bound 6 times less tightly to IKK-1 as compared with IKK-2. Moreover, the k cat with IKK-1 was 2 orders of magnitude smaller than that measured with IKK-2. Interestingly, the dissociation constants measured with IKK-2 agree well with the values measured previously with the multisubunit complex (msIKK) isolated from HeLa S3 cells (see Table I).Table IKinetic and binding constants for ATP and peptide substrates with IKKIKK-2IKK-1msIKKaMultisubunit IκB kinase isolated from HeLa S3 cells (19).K ATPbSee Scheme I for definition.15.5 ± 4.5 μm9.7 ± 1.3 μm7.3 ± 3.4 μmdPreviously reported (19).K IκBcDissociation constant for N-terminal peptide substrate, see Scheme 1 for definition.313 ± 137 μm1950 ± 278 μm140 ± 28 μmdPreviously reported (19).αbSee Scheme I for definition.0.1950.180.11dPreviously reported (19).k cat1.66 ± 0.25 min−10.016 ± 0.009 min−1a Multisubunit IκB kinase isolated from HeLa S3 cells (19Burke J.R.

Open table in a new tab In order to determine the effect on active site binding and catalysis of amino acids around the region of Ser-32 and Ser-36 of IκB-α, peptides of various length were prepared and tested as substrates for IKK-2. As shown in Table II, the peptide corresponding to amino acids 26–42 of IκB-α bound with a dissociation constant of 23 μm, which corresponds to an apparent binding free energy of −6.4 kcal/mol. This apparent binding free energy may underestimate the intrinsic binding free energy since some of the binding energy may be utilized to accelerate catalysis (22Walsh C. Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms. W. H. Freeman, New York1979: 35-36Google Scholar). However, the apparent binding free energies calculated in Table II do provide for a reasonable comparison between peptides since the turnover number (k cat) is relatively constant between peptides. Accordingly, because a peptide corresponding to amino acids 21–42 also bound with an apparent binding free energy of −6.4 kcal/mol, it would suggest that amino acids 21–25 contributes a negligible amount of binding interactions. Amino acids 43–47 provide for a small amount of additional binding interactions (∼-0.9 kcal/mol) as determined by peptide 26–47.Table IIKinetic and binding constants for peptide substrates of IKK-2Peptide sequenceaSer-32 and Ser-36 are underlined.Corresponding amino acids of IκB-αK M app bApparent dissociation constant for peptide at 10 μm ATP.V maxapp cApparent V max at 10 μm ATP, 370 ng/ml IKK-2.ΔG app0 dObserved binding free energy obtained from theK M app(ΔG app0 =RTln(K M app)).μmnm/minkcal/molLDDRHDSGLDSMKDEEY26–4223 ± 44.1 ± 0.3−6.4LDDRHDDGLDSMKDEEY26–42 (S32D)15 ± 71.2 ± 0.2−6.7LDDRHDSGLDDMKDEEY26–42 (S36D)10 ± 51.6 ± 0.2−6.9KKERLLDDRHDSGLDSMKDEEY21–4226 ± 63.0 ± 0.3−6.4LDDRHDSGLDSMKDEEYEQMVK26–476 ± 33.4 ± 0.5−7.3LDDRHDSGLDSMKD26–3933 ± 12.14 ± 0.02−6.2DSGLDSM31–37390 ± 201.6 ± 0.5−4.7a Ser-32 and Ser-36 are underlined.b Apparent dissociation constant for peptide at 10 μm ATP.c Apparent V max at 10 μm ATP, 370 ng/ml IKK-2.d Observed binding free energy obtained from theK M app(ΔG app0 =RTln(K M app)). Open table in a new tab The use of a peptide corresponding to amino acids 26–39 demonstrated that nearly all of the binding free energy (∼−6.2 kcal/mol) with the longer peptides is provided by amino acids 26–39, with little contribution from amino acids 40–42. Indeed, the use of a peptide corresponding to amino acids 31–37 demonstrated that this region provided over two-thirds of the binding free energy of the longer peptides. Peptides corresponding to amino acids 26–42 were synthesized with either Ser-32 or Ser-36 mutated to aspartate in an effort to probe the relative contributions of serines 32 and 36 to substrate binding interactions. As shown in Table II, these peptides bound to the active site with an avidity roughly equivalent to that of the “wild-type” peptide, demonstrating that having at least one of the serines present allowed for comparable binding interactions. Alternatively, the aspartate at either position may mimic phosphorylation at this site and provide for additional binding interactions lost from eliminating the serine. The turnover number (k cat) for either of the mutant peptides was approximately half that of the wild-type peptide, probably owing to there being only one phosphorylation site available. In order to further probe the contribution of the two serines to active site binding interactions, peptides corresponding to amino acids 26–42 were prepared with both serines replaced with either aspartates (S32D/S36D) or alanines (S32A/S36A). Since these “double mutants” could no longer be used as substrates, their active site affinities were determined by using them as inhibitors of the phosphorylation of the wild-type peptide (amino acids 26–42). As shown in Fig. 3, the S32D/S36D mutant showed dose-dependent inhibition of IKK-2, which gave a linear Dixon plot. By comparing the slope of this correlation to that shown by a C-terminal peptide inhibitor, which has a dissociation constant (K Iapp) of 1.5 μm(see below), the dissociation constant for this double mutant was calculated to be 102 μm. The S32A/S36A mutant gave similar results (not shown). This corresponds to an apparent binding free energy of −5.5 kcal/mol, which indicates that the serines themselves only provide −0.9 kcal/mol of binding free energy for the 26–42 peptide (−6.4 versus −5.5 kcal/mol). This, of course, explains why the S32D or S32A “single mutant” peptides bind well to the enzyme. Consistent with amino acids 31–37 of IκB-α providing most of the binding interactions of amino acids 21–47 with the enzyme, peptides corresponding to regions around the analogous serines of IκB-β and IκB-ε were also effective substrates as shown in Table III. Indeed, all three of these peptides have a highly conserved phosphorylation site (DSGX 1 X 2S, where X 1 is either leucine or isoleucine) corresponding to amino acids 31–36 of IκB-α and bind to the enzyme with roughly equivalent affinity. The three peptides also had dissociation constants roughly equal to each other when using IKK-1 as the enzyme source (results not shown).Table IIIKinetic constants for peptides corresponding to the N terminus of IκB-α, IκB-β, and IκB-ɛ used as substrates for IKK-2Peptide sequenceaConsensus phosphorylation sites are underlined.IκBCorresponding amino acids of IκBK M app bApparent dissociation constant for peptide at 20 μm ATP.V maxapp cApparent V max at 20 μm ATP, 300 ng/ml IKK-2.μmnm/minLDDRHDSGLDSMKDEEYIκB-α26–4228 ± 0.25.97 ± 0.01ADEWCDSGLGSLGPDAAIκB-β13–2911 ± 47.2 ± 0.6EESQYDSGIESLRSLRSIκB-ɛ151–16757 ± 511.2 ± 0.5a Consensus phosphorylation sites are underlined.b Apparent dissociation constant for peptide at 20 μm ATP.c Apparent V max at 20 μm ATP, 300 ng/ml IKK-2. Open table in a new tab When comparing the N-terminal peptide to the full-length IκB-α as a substrate for IKK-2, the results shown in Table IV demonstrate that the dissociation constants and k cat values are similar to those of the 26–42 peptide. The dissociation constant of 2 μmfor IκB-α corresponds to an apparent free energy of binding of −7.9 kcal/mol. Therefore, the −4.7 kcal/mol of binding free energy from amino acids 31–37 (see above) represents most of the binding interactions of the full-length IκB-α with IKK-2. Interestingly, the GST-IκB-α fusion protein showed considerably different kinetic constants. As shown in Table IV, the presence of the GST tag greatly diminished the turnover number with a mild effect on the dissociation constant.Table IVKinetic constants for IκB-α and peptide substrates with IKK-2Peptide (26–42)aPeptide corresponding to amino acids 26–42 of IκB-αIκB-αGST-IκB-αK M bApparent dissociation constant for peptide or full-length substrate at 10 μm ATP.26 ± 4 μm2.0 ± 0.9 μm2.6 ± 1.3 μmV max cApparent V max at 10 μm ATP, 350 ng/ml IKK-2.5.0 ± 0.3 nm/min11.4 ± 1.1 nm/min5.1 ± 1.9 nm/mina Peptide corresponding to amino acids 26–42 of IκB-αb Apparent dissociation constant for peptide or full-length substrate at 10 μm ATP.c Apparent V max at 10 μm ATP, 350 ng/ml IKK-2. Open table in a new tab We have previously reported that a C-terminal peptide corresponding to amino acids 279–303 of IκB-α was able to activate the msIKK isolated from HeLa S3 cells to phosphorylate an N-terminal peptide (19Burke J.R. Miller K.R. Wood M.K. Meyers C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12041-12046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In fact, the C-terminal peptide itself was a reasonable substrate for the msIKK. When using the human, recombinant IKK-2 or IKK-1 as the enzyme source, however, phosphorylation of the C-terminal peptide was not observed (results not shown). Moreover, the C-terminal peptide failed to potentiate the IKK-2- or IKK-1-catalyzed phosphorylation of the N-terminal peptide. As shown in Fig. 4, this C-terminal peptide instead showed pure competitive inhibition with respect to an N-terminal (amino acids 26–42) peptide substrate. 2Nonlinear fit to noncompetitive inhibition (21Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar) gave a value for Kii of 24.4 ± 25.2 μm, which is not significantly different from zero. From a nonlinear regression analysis of the data represented in Fig. 4, a KIapp value of 1.5 ± 0.3 μm was obtained. Thus, the C-terminal peptide binds well to the active site, but does not act as either a substrate or activator of the IKK-2. That the C-terminal peptide showed competitive inhibition with respect to the N-terminal peptide substrate is expected from a mechanism detailed in Scheme 2, where the binding of the inhibitor (i.e. the C-terminal peptide) competes with the binding of IκB-α, but not ATP. Also consistent with this mechanism, the inhibition observed with the C-terminal peptide while keeping the concentration of peptide substrate fixed and varying the concentration of ATP showed mixed-type (noncompetitive) inhibition as shown in Fig. 5. As expected from Scheme 2, infinitely large concentrations of ATP are unable to completely overcome the inhibition produced by the C-terminal peptide. However, this analysis does not rule out an ordered binding mechanism, which would have shown a similar inhibition pattern if the peptide substrate binds before ATP (23Fromm H.J. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 467-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Verification of a random sequential binding mechanism comes from the use of staurosporine as an inhibitor. Staurosporine, which is known to bind to the ATP binding site of kinases (24Lamers M.B. Antson A.A. Hubbard R.E. Scott R.K. Williams D.H. J. Mol.
