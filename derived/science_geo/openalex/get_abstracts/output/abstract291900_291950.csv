https://openalex.org/W2062761263,"Sodium-aluminum silicate gels are found in surficial deposits as thick as 5 centimeters in the Magadi area of Kenya. Chemical data indicate they are formed by the interaction of hot alkaline springwaters (67 degrees to 82 degrees C; pH, about 9) with alkali trachyte flows and their detritus, rather than by direct precipitation. In the process, Na(2)O is added from and silica is released to the saline waters of the springs. Algal mats protect the gels from erosion and act as thermal insulators. The gels are probably yearly accumulates that are washed into the lakes during floods. Crystallization of these gels in the laboratory yields analcite; this fact suggests that some analcite beds in lacustrine deposits may have formed from gels. Textural evidence indicates that cherts of rocks of the Pleistocene chert series in the Magadi area may have formed from soft sodium silicate gels. Similar gels may have acted as substrates for the accumulation and preservation of prebiological organic matter during the Precambrian."

Opaline silica was deposited on inner surfaces of cell walls so that silica replicas of the various types of cell lumens were produced. Entire twigs were not replicated intact, but macroscopic replicas of cell aggregates were common. Carbon replicas of the silica replicas provide an unusual view of cellular spaces in woody tissue. The pits were viewed as projections from cells rather than holes in cell walls. This technique offers a new way of examining woody tissue and a method for deliberate petrification in a relatively short period of time under laboratory conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2008744275,X-ray crystallographic investigations of potassium hydrogen malonate crystals reveal a very unusual structure in which malonic acid molecules and doubly ionized malonate ions exist in equal numbers. These two species a nected by strong hydrogen bonds in one direction and by potassium ions in the other directions. This seems to be the first observation of the simultaneous ence in a crystal of the two species dicarboxylic acid molecules and their charged ions.

https://openalex.org/W1969840783,A possible glacial boulder of undeformed and unmetamorphosed siltstone containing Middle Pennsylvanian plant fossils was recovered from the Bronx. The rock cannot be explained by known geologic relations and suggests the possibility of undetected outliers of Pennsylvanian rocks in the Hudson valley.
