https://openalex.org/W1994724896,"The control of the cylindrical cell form in plants appears to reside in the orientation of the reinforcing cellulose microfibrils in the side walls. In elongating cells the fibrils are typically transverse. Control of new synthesis of oriented wall texture is shown to be in turn related to the orientation of cytoplasmic elements in the cell periphery. Three properties of these cytoplasmic elements have been deduced from polarization optical properties of treated and normal cell walls. These deduced properties- namely, possession of a long axis and the ability to build microfibrils perpendicular to it, a tendency to cross-bond to make a parallel array, and a sensitivity of this alignment to colchicine-are all well-known properties of mitotic spindle and phragmoplast fibers which form the cross-wall after mitosis. It is proposed that proteins of spindle fiber nature exist in cortical cytoplasm of plant cells and are active in the control of wall texture and cell form."

https://openalex.org/W1987475868,"Abstract : In order to detect contamination of equipment and to protect the health of workers in laboratories handling radioactive materials, it is necessary to have instruments capable of indicating small amounts of radiation at the working space and on the person and clothing of workers. Several excellent portable radiation meters are now on the market, but only the most recent ones are effective in detecting weak radiation, the older ones generally being designed for monitoring X-rays. As Libby points out, the isotopes emitting the least energetic radiation are among the most useful. By substituting a more sensitive GM tube for the one ordinarily furnished, older instruments easily may be changed to permit them to detect a fraction of these weak radiations large enough so that they may be of service in monitoring laboratories."
