https://openalex.org/W1973769167,"Electron diffraction patterns of the fullerene C(60) in the gaseous state have been obtained by volatilizing it from a newly designed oven-nozzle at 730 degrees C. The many peaks of the experimental radial distribution curve calculated from the scattered intensity are completely consistent with icosahedral symmetry for the free molecule. On the basis of this symmetry assumption, least-squares refinement of a model incorporating all possible interatomic distances led to the values r(g)(C(1)-C(2)) = 1.458(6) angstroms (A) for the thermal average bond length within the five-member ring (that is, for the bond fusing five- and six-member rings) and r(g)(C(1)-C(6)) = 1.401(10) A for that connecting five-member rings (the bond fusing six-member rings). The weighted average of the two bond lengths and the difference between them are the values 1.439(2) A and 0.057(6) A, respectively. The diameter of the icosahedral sphere is 7.113(10) A. The uncertainties in parentheses are estimated 2sigma values."

https://openalex.org/W2056778445,"Single-crystal x-ray diffraction methods were used to determine the crystal and molecular structure of C(60) buckminsterfullerene. At 110 kelvin C(60) is cubic, apparent Laue symmetry m3m, but it exhibits noncrystallographic systematic extinctions indicative of a twin in which I(hkl) and I(khl) are superimposed. In fact, C(60) crystallizes with four molecules in space group [See equation in the PDF file] of the cubic system (Laue symmetry m3) with lattice constant a = 14.052(5) angstroms (A) at 110 kelvin. The twin components are equal. A given component, which has crystallographically imposed symmetry [See equation in the PDF file] displays an ordered structure of a truncated icosahedron. The five independent C=C bonds that join C(6) rings average 1.355(9) A; the ten independent C-C bonds that join C(6) and C(5) rings average 1.467(21) A. The mean atom-to-atom diameter of the C(60) molecule is 7.065(3) A. The molecules are very tightly packed in the crystal structure, with intermolecular C...C distances as short as 3.131(7) A."
https://openalex.org/W2090151175,"The timing of flood basalt volcanism associated with formation of the Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) is estimated from paleomagnetic and paleontologic data. Much of OJP formed rapidly in less than 3 million years during the early Aptian, at the beginning of the Cretaceous Normal Polarity Superchron. Crustal emplacement rates are inferred to have been several times those of the Deccan Traps. These estimates are consistent with an origin of the OJP by impingement at the base of the oceanic lithosphere by the head of a large mantle plume. Formation of the OJP may have led to a rise in sea level that induced global oceanic anoxia. Carbon dioxide emissions likely contributed to the mid-Cretaceous greenhouse climate but did not provoke major biologic extinctions."

The transition from the low-density amorphous phase to the high-density amorphous phase was distinct and reversible in an apparently narrow pressure range at approximately 130 to approximately 150 kelvin, which provided experimental evidence for polymorphism in amorphous H(2)O."
https://openalex.org/W2078395518,"In eusocial Hymenoptera, the haplodiploid system of sex determination creates relatedness asymmetries such that workers are more closely related on average to their sisters than to their brothers. For such societies, kin-selection theory and sex-ratio theory predict that workers maximize their inclusive fitness by biasing the investment sex ratio toward females. To test the prediction of sex-ratio biasing, relatedness asymmetries were experimentally manipulated in colonies of the primitively eusocial bee Augochlorella striata (Halictidae: Hymenoptera) by removing or not removing foundress queens. Queenright colonies (relatedness asymmetry present) produced a more female-biased sex ratio than did queenless colonies (relatedness asymmetry absent). Worker reproduction and unmated replacement queens can be discounted as alternative explanations. Workers therefore facultatively adjusted their colony's sex ratio and, in the presence of a relatedness asymmetry, biased the investment sex ratio toward their more closely related sisters and away from their more distantly related brothers."
https://openalex.org/W2069999216,The frog's retina projects into the superficial neuropil of the opposite tectum in four functionally different layers of terminals. Each layer displays a continuous map of the retina in terms of its particular function. The four maps are in register. The fourth-dimensional order is reconstituted after section and regeneration of the optic fibers.
https://openalex.org/W2086148551,"Full configuraton-interaction (FCI) calculations have given an unambiguous standard by which the accuracy of theoretical approaches of incorporating electron correlation into molecular structure calculations can be judged. In addition, improvements in vectorization of programs, computer technology, and algorithms now permit a systematic study of the convergence of the atomic orbital (or so-called one-particle) basis set. These advances are discussed and some examples of the solution of chemical problems by quantum mechanical calculations are given to illustrate the accuracy of current techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2059947094,"Oxygen isotope zoning was examined within garnet with the use of the stable isotope laser probe. Four metamorphic garnets from the regional metamorphic terrane in Vermont and the skarn deposit at Carr Fork, Utah, were examined and were found to be concentrically zoned in delta(18)O values. The largest variations in delta(18)O values were observed in the regional metamorphic garnets, where delta(18)O values change by 3 per mil from core to rim. These oxygen isotope zoning profiles reflect the changes in the delta(18)O values of the rocks during garnet growth, which are caused by infiltration of fluids and by dehydration reactions during metamorphism."
https://openalex.org/W1965001715,"Calculations of the solar and lunar effects on highly eccentric satellite orbits show that the sun and the moon may cause large changes in perigee height over extended periods of time. The amplitude and sign of the perigee height variations depend on the orbit parameters and the hour of launch; for a typical orbit and various choices of launch time, the perigee height will either rise or fall at the rate of 1 km/day over the course of several months. These results may be significant in deciding the launch conditions for future satellites with highly eccentric orbits."
