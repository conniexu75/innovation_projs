https://openalex.org/W1551348338,"The purpose of the present study was to determine whether ultraviolet light (UV) irradiation of amino acids produces compounds with affinity for the Ah receptor. Aqueous solutions of L-tryptophan were exposed to radiation from an unfiltered high-pressure mercury lamp. The photoproducts formed were solvent-extracted or concentrated on Sep-Pak C18 cartridges. The concentrated extracts or eluants were treated for their ability to compete with 3H-labeled 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Binding was assayed in liver cytosolic preparations from Sprague-Dawley rats using a technique based on hydroxylapatite separation. Photoproducts with receptor affinity were formed in a time-dependent manner. Histidine and tryptamine also gave products upon UV irradiation that competed with TCDD. Commercial tryptophan, at least aged, contained trace amounts of impurities with receptor affinity. Analysis by TLC and high-pressure liquid chromatography of the photo-products of tryptophan showed a minimum of three different binding compounds. Two of the products were studied in greater detail. One of them, showing UV absorbance and yellow fluorescence, gave a molecular ion (M+) of 284 and the other gave M+ 312 but showed little UV absorption and fluorescence. The concentration, based on mass spectrometry quantifications, of the two compounds that displaced more than 50% of TCDD was found to be extremely low, giving Kd values of 0.44 nM (M+ 312) and 0.07 nM (M+ 284). The existence of high affinity receptors for oxidized amino acids is postulated and their possible role in the proliferative cellular responses to TCDD and tryptophan is discussed briefly."
https://openalex.org/W1526379338,"Topoisomerase II was purified from an amsacrine-resistant mutant of P388 leukemia. A procedure has been developed which allows the rapid purification of nearly homogeneous enzyme in quantities sufficient for enzyme studies or production of specific antisera. The purified topoisomerase II migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as two bands with apparent molecular masses of 180 (p180) and 170 kDa (p170); both proteins unknotted P4 DNA in an ATP-dependent manner and displayed amsacrine-stimulated covalent attachment to DNA. Staphylococcus V8 protease cleavage patterns of p170 and p180 showed distinct differences. Specific polyclonal antibodies to either p170 or p180 recognized very selectively the form of the enzyme used to generate the antibodies. Immunoblotting with these specific antibodies showed that both p180 and p170 were present in cells lysed immediately in boiling sodium dodecyl sulfate. Comparison of the purified topoisomerase II from amsacrine-resistant P388 with that from amsacrine-sensitive P388 demonstrated that each cell type contained both p180 and p170; however, the relative amounts of the two proteins were consistently different in the two cell types. The data strongly suggest that p170 is not a proteolytic fragment of p180. Thus, P388 cells appear to contain two distinct forms of topoisomerase II."
https://openalex.org/W86687369,"Human class II histocompatibility antigens were purified from the Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human B lymphoblastoid cell line LG-2 by immunoaffinity chromatography. This is the first time all three subsets have been prepared as nonradioactive materials on a milligram scale. The yields of DR, DQ, and DP from 10 g of cells were approximately 12, 2, and 0.2 mg, respectively. Cross-contamination of the subsets was found to be less than 2% when assayed by measuring the binding of antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies to antigen immobilized on fixed erythrocytes. The three purified subsets were extensively characterized. They contained no detectable invariant chain. The three proteins were distinguished by their migration on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. The denatured antigens were susceptible to partial removal of carbohydrate by endoglycosidase H and apparently complete removal of carbohydrate by endoglycosidase F. The isolated, denatured chains differed in their affinities for radiolabeled lectins, suggesting differences in carbohydrate structures. A water-soluble form of each antigen was prepared by a controlled papain digestion of the native antigen. Both native and denatured antigens were analyzed for their reactivities with a panel of class II antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies, allowing a precise definition of the specificities of the antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1580635113,"Abstract The stromelysin gene encodes a potent tissue-degrading proteinase whose activity is important in tissue-remoldeling processes such as wound healing, the inflammatory reaction, rheumatoid arthritis, tumor invasion, and possibly embryonic development. In light of the ability of interleukin-1 to amplify, and ability of glucocorticoids to attenuate the inflammatory response, we tested interleukin-1 and dexamethasone for regulatory effects on stromelysin gene expression. We report that interleukin-1 induces the stromelysin gene, and dexamethasone diminishes the level of induction by interleukin-1, epidermal growth factor, phorbol ester, and cAMP elevation (elicited by cholera toxin). Similar responses are conferred upon a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase coding sequence by a 700-base pair stromelysin 5'-flanking fragment, implying transcription regulation by sequence elements in this region."
https://openalex.org/W1917300465,"The Escherichia coli mutH gene product has been isolated in near homogeneous form using an in vitro complementation assay for DNA mismatch correction (Lu, A.-L., Clark, S., and Modrich, P. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 4639-4643) which is dependent on mutH function. The protein has a subunit Mr of 25,000, and purified preparations contain a Mg2+-dependent endonuclease activity which cleaves 5' to the dG of d(GATC) sequences to generate 5'-phosphoryl and 3'-hydroxyl termini. Symmetrically methylated d(GATC) sites are resistant to the endonuclease, hemimethylated sequences are cleaved on the unmethylated strand, and unmethylated d(GATC) sites are usually subject to scission on only one DNA strand. Although this endonuclease activity is extremely weak (less than 1 scission/h/mutH monomer equivalent) and cleavage at a d(GATC) site does not depend on the presence of a mismatched base pair within the DNA substrate, the activity does not appear to be a contaminant of mutH preparations. d(GATC) endonuclease activity and mutH complementing activity co-purify through multiple column steps without change in relative specific activities, and both activities co-electrophorese under native conditions. These findings suggest that the mutH product functions at the strand discrimination stage of mismatch correction and that this stage of the reaction involves scission of the unmethylated DNA strand."
https://openalex.org/W1567412734,"OmpR and EnvZ, the protein products of the ompB locus, are regulatory components required for osmoexpression of outer membrane porin proteins, OmpF and OmpC, in Escherichia coli. EnvZ is considered to be an osmosensor which transmits signals across the membrane to OmpR, a transcriptional activator for ompF and ompC. We inserted the envZ gene into a high expression vector, pIN-III. Following cellular fractionation, EnvZ was found to be localized in the inner membrane. Sequence analysis revealed that the signal peptide-like N-terminal sequence was not removed from the purified EnvZ. A genetic approach using EnvZ/beta-lactamase fusion proteins was taken to determine the topology of EnvZ in the inner membrane. When beta-lactamase was fused after the N-terminal signal peptide-like sequence, ampicillin resistance, conferred by the beta-lactamase moiety of the fusion protein, was expressed. However, when beta-lactamase was fused after the second downstream apolar sequence, the cells showed very poor ampicillin resistance indicating that the enzyme was localized on the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane. The results of this approach reveal that the hydrophilic region of EnvZ between the two apolar sequences is periplasmically localized and that the hydrophilic region downstream of the second apolar sequence is cytoplasmically directed. These results were confirmed by partial proteolysis of the fusion proteins in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W1493097357,"A DNA replication system was developed that could generate rolling-circle DNA molecules in vitro in amounts that permitted kinetic analyses of the movement of the replication forks. Two artificial primer-template DNA substrates were used to study DNA synthesis catalyzed by the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme in the presence of either the preprimosomal proteins (the primosomal proteins minus the DNA G primase) and the Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA binding protein or the DNA B helicase alone. Helicase activities have recently been demonstrated to be associated with the primosome, a mobile multiprotein priming apparatus that requires seven E. coli proteins (replication factor Y (protein n'), proteins n and nâ€³, and the products of the dnaB, dnaC, dnaG, and dnaT genes) for assembly, and with the DNA B protein. Consistent with a rolling-circle mechanism in which a helicase activity permitted extensive (-) strand DNA synthesis on a (+) single-stranded, circular DNA template, the major DNA products formed were multigenome-length, single-stranded, linear molecules. The replication forks assembled with either the preprimosome or the DNA B helicase moved at the same rate (approximately 730 nucleotides/s) at 30 degrees C and possessed apparent processivities in the range of 50,000-150,000 nucleotides. The single-stranded DNA binding protein was not required to maintain this high rate of movement in the case of leading strand DNA synthesis catalyzed by the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme and the DNA B helicase."
https://openalex.org/W41751146,"Sixty kilobases of cloned DNA containing the entire human pro-alpha 2(I) collagen gene and 22 kilobases of flanking sequences have been isolated. Like the homologous avian gene, the 1366 amino acid residues of the human pre-pro-alpha 2(I) chain are encoded by 52 exons, whose relative locations and sizes have been determined. Analysis of the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions have confirmed their exact lengths, as well as conclusively established the nature of five polymorphic mRNA transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W1515674329,"French Canadians living in eastern Quebec are carriers of a severe type of Tay-Sachs disease, known as the classic form, 10 times more often than the general population. The alpha-chain of beta-hexosaminidase A, a lysosomal enzyme composed of two chains (alpha, beta), bears the mutation in this inherited disorder. We previously reported that the 5' end of the alpha-chain gene was deleted in two such patients (Myerowitz, R., and Hogikyan, N.D. (1986) Science, 232, 1646-1648). The present study reports the size, precise location, and environment of the deletion. A clone encompassing the deletion was isolated from a genomic library constructed in lambda EMBL3 with DNA from a patient's fibroblasts. Comparison of the restriction maps of the clone with that of the normal gene (Proia, R.L., and Soravia, E. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5677-5681) showed that the deletion was 7.6 kilobases long and included part of intron 1, all of exon 1 and extended 2000 base pairs upstream past the putative promotor region of the alpha-chain gene. These data are consistent with the inability to detect mRNA and immunoprecipitable alpha-chain protein in this mutant. Sequence analysis of the deletion junction in the mutant and corresponding regions of the normal gene demonstrated the presence of similarly oriented Alu sequences at the 5' and 3' deletion boundaries. The data are in accord with the possibility that the deletion may have arisen during homologous recombination from unequal crossing over between Alu sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1534587066,"The recently cloned human beta-adrenergic cDNA and several mutated forms have been expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes by injection of RNA made from the cDNA under the control of the bacteriophage SP6 promoter. The cDNA and gene of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor possess the unusual feature of having a second upstream ATG (-101 base pairs) and a 19-codon open reading frame 5' to the initiator methionine codon of the receptor (Kobilka, B. K., Dixon, R. A. F., Frielle, T., Dohlman, H. G., Bolanowski, M., Sigal, I. S., Yang-Feng, T. L., Francke, U., Caron, M. G., and Lefkowitz, R. J. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 46-50). RNA lacking this upstream AUG and open reading frame was translated approximately 10-fold more efficiently both in an in vitro rabbit reticulocyte system and in oocytes. Injected oocytes but not water injected controls expressed typical beta 2-adrenergic receptors as assessed by ligand binding (450 fmol/mg membrane protein) and catecholamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase (approximately 20 fold). Moreover, these receptors displayed typical agonist-induced homologous desensitization when oocytes were incubated with isoproterenol at room temperature for 3-24 h. Among a series of mutations, truncations of the membrane-anchored core of the receptor eliminated receptor binding and cyclase stimulating activity. In contrast, disruption of one of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites or removal of the serine/threonine-rich carboxyl terminus had little or no effect on these functions or on the extent of agonist-induced desensitization relative to that observed with native receptor. These studies validate the beta 2-adrenergic nature of the cloned human beta-adrenergic cDNA, document the utility of the Xenopus oocyte system for studying functional and regulatory properties of receptors coupled to adenylate cyclase, and suggest the possibility that elements in the 5' untranslated region of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor RNA may regulate its translation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1569894631,"Purified plasma and urinary protein C inhibitors (PCI) formed heparin-dependent complexes with activated protein C (APC) which were detected by immunoblotting after nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. Bands representing APC.PCI complexes were also seen on immunoblots after incubation of plasma with APC and heparin. The same immunoblot pattern of complexes was detected by three different methods: method A, monoclonal antibody to plasminogen activator inhibitor-3 (PAI-3, urinary urokinase inhibitor) + 125I-labeled anti-mouse IgG; method B, polyclonal antibodies to PCI + 125I-labeled purified plasma PCI; and method C, monoclonal antibody to protein C + 125I-protein C. Plasma depleted of PAI-3 by immunoadsorption with insolubilized monoclonal antibody to PAI-3 showed no detectable antigen or complexes with APC as visualized by methods A or B. This PAI-3-depleted plasma had less than 10% of the heparin-dependent inhibitory activity of normal plasma toward APC. Purified plasma PCI was fully reactive in an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay for PAI-3, and plasma and urinary PCI inhibited urokinase activity in a heparin-dependent manner. These data indicate that heparin-dependent plasma and urinary PCI and PAI-3 are immunologically and functionally very similar if not identical. This observation identifies a new interrelation between the protein C anticoagulant and the fibrinolytic systems. In addition, plasma contains a heparin-independent inhibitor of APC which is not immunologically related to plasma PCI or to PAI-3."
https://openalex.org/W82298004,"We recently identified an enzyme which we have designated inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase that hydrolyzes both inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (Ins-1,3,4-P3) and inositol 1,4-bisphosphate (Ins-1,4-P2), yielding inositol 3,4-bisphosphate and inositol 4-phosphate, respectively, as products (Inhorn, R. C., Bansal, V.S., and Majerus, P.W. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 2170-2174). We have now purified the inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase 3600-fold from calf brain supernatant. The purified enzyme has an apparent molecular mass of 44,000 daltons as determined by gel filtration and is free of other inositol phosphate phosphatase activities. The enzyme hydrolyzes Ins-1,4-P2 with an apparent Km of approximately 4-5 microM, while it degrades Ins-1,3,4-P3 with an apparent Km of approximately 20 microM. The enzyme hydrolyzes these substrates at approximately the same maximal velocity. Inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase shows a sigmoidal dependence upon magnesium ion, with 0.3 mM Mg2+ causing half-maximal stimulation. A Hill plot of the data is linear with a value of n = 1.9, suggesting that the enzyme binds magnesium cooperatively. Calcium and manganese inhibit enzyme activity, with 50% inhibition at approximately 6 microM. Lithium inhibits Ins-1,4-P2 hydrolysis uncompetitively with a Ki of approximately 6 mM. This mechanism of lithium inhibition is similar to that observed for the inositol monophosphate phosphatase (originally designated myo-inositol-1-phosphatase; Hallcher, L.M., and Sherman, W.R. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 10896-10901), suggesting that these two enzymes are related. Lithium also inhibits Ins-1,3,4-P3 hydrolysis with an estimated Ki of 0.5-1 mM."
https://openalex.org/W1586394279,"Human poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase consists of three proteolytically separable domains, the first for binding of DNA, the second for automodification, and the third for binding of the substrate, NAD (Ushiro, H., Yokoyama, Y., and Shizuta, Y. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 2352-2357). We have isolated and sequenced cDNA clones for the enzyme using synthesized oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes based on the partial amino acid sequence of the protein. The open reading frame determined encodes a protein of 1,013 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 113,203. The deduced amino acid sequence is consistent with the partial amino acid sequences of tryptic or alpha-chymotryptic peptides and the total amino acid composition of the purified enzyme. The native enzyme is relatively hydrophilic as judged from the hydrophilicity profile of the total amino acid sequence. The net charge of the NAD binding domain is neutral but the DNA binding domain and the automodification domain are considerably rich in lysine residue and quite basic. The DNA binding domain involves a homologous repeat in the sequence and exhibits a sequence homology with localized regions of transforming proteins such as c-fos and v-fos. Furthermore, this domain contains a unique sequence element which resembles the essential peptide sequences for nuclear location of SV40 and polyoma virus large T antigens. These facts suggest the possibility that the physiological function of poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase lies in its ability to bind to DNA and to control transformation of living eukaryotic cells like the cases of those oncogene products."
https://openalex.org/W1575978929,"A cDNA clone encoding the peroxisomal enzyme glycolate oxidase (EC 1.1.3.15) was identified by probing a cDNA library of spinach with synthetic oligonucleotides based on the partial amino acid sequence of the enzyme. Determination of the DNA sequence of the 1526-nucleotide cDNA indicated a 1107-nucleotide open reading frame which encodes a polypeptide of 40,282 daltons. The polypeptide produced by in vitro transcription and translation of the cDNA insert had the same apparent subunit molecular mass as the enzyme purified from leaves, indicating that the cDNA encodes a full-length polypeptide and that no cleavage of the polypeptide is required for uptake of the polypeptide by peroxisomes. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with those of two other plant peroxisomal proteins revealed a region of homology which may be involved in directing proteins to the peroxisome."
https://openalex.org/W1217469727,"We provide the first nucleotide sequence information for the slow isoform of troponin T (TnT). Sequence and hybridization analyses revealed that a single slow TnT gene present in the human genome gives rise to at least two different slow TnT variants by alternative splicing. The observed variations in slow TnT splicing generated major structural differences between the two corresponding slow TnT proteins in a domain that is likely to be involved in critical interactions with troponin C, troponin I, and tropomyosin in the thin filament. Corresponding variations have not been found for fast or for cardiac TnT. The comparison of splicing patterns for fast, cardiac, and slow TnT reveals that the splicing pattern for each isoform is unique. These features raise important questions of why and how all the individual members of the closely related TnT gene family developed such complex but different schemes of alternative splicing to create sets of variant proteins. This unusual familial trait is not known in any other muscle or nonmuscle multigene family."
https://openalex.org/W1598592015,"The effects of various phorbol esters on the interaction of human cells with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (rTNF-alpha) was investigated. Preexposure of several different types of cells with only biologically active tumor promoter, i.e. 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), inhibited the specific binding of rTNF-alpha to its receptor. The reduction in specific binding of TNF-alpha was observed only by PMA but not with several other phorbol esters tested. 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol, which is an analogue of the natural protein kinase C activator, diacylglycerol, was active in down-regulating TNF-alpha receptors but only at 1000 times concentration than PMA. Scatchard analysis of the binding data on U-937 cells revealed that PMA caused a decrease in high affinity cell surface receptor number (approximately 8300 versus approximately 2500 binding sites/cell) without any significant change in the dissociation constant (0.38 nM versus 0.32 nM). This decrease in receptor number is dependent on temperature, the time of exposure, and dose of PMA. Greater than 95% of the specific binding of 125I-TNF-alpha could be abolished within 10 min by preexposure of cells to 10 nM PMA at 37 degrees C. The down-regulation of receptors by PMA occurred only at 37 degrees C but not at 4 degrees C, suggesting a probable internalization of the receptors. The specific binding of TNF-alpha to detergent-solubilized cell extracts remained unchanged after exposure of cells to PMA. The rates of dissociation of TNF-alpha from the cell surface and the rate of internalization was not significantly affected by PMA, but the rate of disappearance from cell interior and its appearance into the medium was slightly enhanced by PMA. PMA did not alter the rate of degradation of the TNF-alpha nor cause the shedding of receptors into the medium. Approximately 70% of TNF-alpha cell surface receptors could be regenerated within 16 h after PMA removal. These results suggest the involvement of PMA-activated protein kinase C in down-regulation and redistribution of TNF-alpha receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1494740160,"Plexaura homomalla is a rich natural source of prostaglandins and recent evidence suggest the prostaglandin biosynthesis could occur through a lipoxygenase pathway. We have investigated the metabolism of arachidonic acid in homogenates and acetone powders of the fresh frozen coral. The biosynthesis of natural prostaglandins was not detected. However, we find a prominent 8(R)-lipoxygenase pathway leading to an alpha-ketol, characterized by high pressure liquid chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and NMR as 8-hydroxy, 9-keto-eicosa-5Z, 11Z, 14Z-trienoic acid, and a prostaglandin A-like cyclopentenone identified as 9-oxo-[8, 12-cis]-prosta-5Z, 10, 14Z-trienoic acid. These reactions appear analogous to the transformation of linolenic acid hydroperoxide by and of corn and flaxseed. From analysis of the absolute configurations of the coral products, and from additional stable isotope labeling experiments in H218O and D2O, we deduce that both compounds arise via conversion of 8(R)-HPETE to an 8(R), 9-allene oxide, 8R,9-oxido-eicosa-5Z, 9, 11Z, 14Z-tetraenoic acid. This unstable intermediate undergoes hydrolysis to form the alpha-ketol or cyclization to give the cyclopentenone. Significantly, we find that the prostaglandin-like product is a racemic mixture of cis side chain enantiomers, pointing to its nonenzymatic origin from the allene oxide. The alpha-ketol is formed with partial racemization and inversion of configuration, also compatible with formation in a nonenzymatic reaction. We conclude that the isomerase and cyclase reactions may merely reflect nonenzymatic breakdown of the enzymatically formed allene oxide. The origin of the endogenous (chiral) prostaglandins of the coral may involve an allene oxide intermediate, although the potential for formation of racemic products presents an interesting dilemma regarding its relationship to the natural pathway of biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1519148488,"Abstract We isolated the chromosomal gene for human interleukin-5 (IL-5) from human genomic libraries using a cloned human IL-5 cDNA as probe. Nucleotide sequence determination of the IL-5 gene and its flanking regions showed that the gene consisted of four exons and three introns. TATA-like and CAAT-like sequences reside 26 and 73 base pairs, respectively, upstream of the transcription initiation site identified by S1 mapping analysis. The 5'-flanking region of the IL-5 gene has sequences homologous with those of the corresponding regions of the genes for human granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, murine IL-4, human interferon-gamma, and human IL-2. The intron-exon organization and location of the cysteine residue suggest that the IL-5 gene is phylogenetically related to the genes for the granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-4, and IL-2, although their amino acid sequences are not significantly conserved."
https://openalex.org/W80153518,"Alveolar macrophages have been shown to secrete a procollagenase and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP), which are similar or identical to the corresponding proteins of human skin fibroblasts. Little is known, however, about the collagenolytic activity of normal human monocytes. We have applied immunologic, biochemical, and molecular biologic tools to examine the collagenolytic profile of freshly isolated peripheral blood monocytes. Our studies indicate that: 1) monocytes are capable of producing both procollagenase and TIMP that are identical to the corresponding products of skin fibroblasts, alveolar macrophages, and U-937 cells; 2) unstimulated monocytes in vitro secrete high levels of TIMP, but little or no procollagenase; 3) an as yet unidentified component(s) of serum are required for in vitro production of TIMP (but not procollagenase) by monocytes; 4) even when stimulated, monocytes secrete much smaller quantities of procollagenase in comparison with macrophages; and 5) regulation of the secretion of procollagenase and TIMP by monocytes exhibits a high degree of individual variability, but is nevertheless subject to clearly different control mechanisms than our previous findings would indicate for alveolar macrophages. Monocytes thus express a macrophage-like, rather than a neutrophil-like, profile of proteins capable of mediating collagen turnover, the regulation of which is distinct from that of more differentiated alveolar macrophages. Further study of monocyte and macrophage collagenolytic activities may provide insights into both the cell biology of mononuclear phagocyte maturation and the mechanisms by which such cells mediate the turnover of interstitial collagens."
https://openalex.org/W1566189726,"The carbon monoxide dehydrogenase complex from acetate-grown Methanosarcina thermophila was further studied by EPR spectroscopy. The as purified enzyme exhibited no paramagnetic species at 113 K; however, enzyme reduced with CO exhibited a complex EPR spectrum comprised of two paramagnetic species with g values of g1 = 2.089, g2 = 2.078, and g3 = 2.030 (signal I) and g1 = 2.057, g2 = 2.049, and g3 = 2.027 (signal II). Isotopic substitution with 61Ni, 57Fe, or 13CO resulted in broadening of the EPR spectra indicating a Ni-Fe-C spin-coupled complex. Pure signal II was obtained following treatment of the CO-reduced enzyme with acetyl-CoA but not by addition of acetyl phosphate or CoASH. Acetate-grown cells were highly enriched in acetate kinase (EC 2.7.2.1) and CoASH-dependent phosphotransacetylase (EC 2.3.1.8) activities. These results suggest acetyl-CoA is a physiological substrate for the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase complex synthesized in acetate-grown cells of M. thermophila."
https://openalex.org/W1591452969,"To examine the biochemical basis for growth factor-induced responses in human lung cancer cells, we used the quin2 technique to study the effect of the amphibian peptide bombesin and its congeners including mammalian gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) on the intracellular free calcium level [Ca2+]i in small cell lung cancer cell lines. In five of eleven cell lines tested, Tyr4-bombesin or GRP elicited a rapid and transient increase in [Ca2+]i. The response was seen with as little as 1 nM ligand, was not affected by membrane depolarization, and derived in part from internal calcium stores. Desensitization to a second addition of active bombesin congeners occurs subsequent to initial addition of Tyr4-bombesin. Structure-activity analysis showed the carboxyl-terminal octapeptide was the active portion of the peptide. Analogs in which the carboxyl terminus was oxidized or deamidated were inactive. Ranatensin, litorin, alytesin, and GRP, but not physalaemin, were as active as Tyr4-bombesin. A monoclonal antibody to the carboxyl terminus of bombesin selectively blocked the increased [Ca2+]i elicited by Tyr4-bombesin. These studies suggest that bombesin congeners can act on some small cell lung cancer cell lines by a pathway utilizing increased [Ca2+]i."
https://openalex.org/W2277469521,"The estrogenic and antiestrogenic activities of tamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen have been measured on the expression of two estrogen-regulated RNAs (pNR-1 and pNR-2) in the MCF7 human breast cancer cell line cultured in phenol red-free medium. The two antiestrogens increased the level of the pNR-1 RNA to about 80% of the estradiol-induced level, and the induction by estradiol was not significantly antagonized by either antiestrogen. In contrast, the pNR-2 mRNA was only increased to about 10% of the estradiol-induced level, and its induction by estradiol was antagonized by both tamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Thus, the two RNAs respond in dramatically different ways to these antiestrogens. 4-Hydroxytamoxifen and estradiol have similar affinities for the estrogen receptor; however, the induction of both RNAs by 4-hydroxytamoxifen required a 10-fold higher concentration than estradiol for maximum agonist activity, and a 500-fold molar excess was required to antagonize the induction by estradiol. Tamoxifen has a 20-100-fold lower affinity than estradiol for the estrogen receptor. A 200-fold higher concentration was required for maximum agonist activity and a 10,000-fold molar excess to antagonize the induction by estradiol. These results emphasize the complexity of antiestrogen action in human breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1487194689,"Abstract Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was shown to elicit NADPH-dependent superoxide (O2-) production by a cell-free system derived from sonically disrupted resting guinea pig macrophages (Bromberg, Y., and Pick, E. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 13539-13545). O2- production was absolutely dependent on the cooperation between a membrane-associated component, sedimenting with the 48,000 X g pellet and a cytosolic factor, nonsedimentable at 265,000 X g. The present report describes the solubilization and characterization of the membrane-associated component of the SDS-activable O2(-)-forming NADPH oxidase (operationally termed pi). Treatment of the 48,000 X g pellet with 30 mM octyl glucoside resulted in complete transfer of pi to the soluble fraction. The solubilized pellet produced an average of 0.92 mumol of O2-/mg of protein/min upon reduction of octyl glucoside content below the critical micellar concentration and in the presence of cytosol, 100 microM SDS, and 0.2 mM NADPH. The activity of solubilized pellet-cytosol combinations was also expressed as NADPH-dependent, azide-resistant oxygen consumption and hydrogen peroxide production. pi was inactivated by the sulfhydryl reagent p-chloromercuribenzoate. Solubilized pellet contained spectroscopically detectable cytochrome b559 (225.6 +/- 15.0 pmol/mg mg protein). Both pi and cytochrome b559 were bound by Cibacron Blue Sepharose and could be eluted by a gradient of octyl glucoside (0-30 mM) in the presence of 1 M KCl. On high performance gel filtration on Superose 12, both pi and cytochrome b559 eluted in the excluded volume; when 25 mM octyl glucoside was present in the elution buffer, pi was partially dissociated from cytochrome b559. Sequential purification of pi on Blue Sepharose followed by gel filtration on Superose 12 in the presence of 25 mM octyl glucoside lead to complete resolution of pi from cytochrome b559 (pi was found in the Mr = 28,000 - 11,000 range while the bulk of cytochrome b559 eluted in the Mr = 113,000 - 71,000 range). We propose that pi is distinct from cytochrome b559 and represents a membrane-associated component in an amphiphile-activated electron transport chain from NADPH to oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W1552295026,"Abstract Reovirus mRNAs synthesized by the virion-associated RNA polymerase contain a 5'-terminal cap that is added to nascent transcripts by polypeptide lambda 2, a structural component of virions encoded by double-stranded RNA genome segment L2. The complete, 3916-nucleotide sequence of a full-length reovirus type 3 L2 DNA clone was determined by the dideoxy chain terminator method. The sequence has a single long open reading frame extending from the second A-T-G at nucleotide 14 to a termination codon at position 3881. On this basis, the 1289-amino acid sequence of polypeptide lambda 2, the reovirus mRNA guanylyltransferase, was deduced and compared to other GTP-binding proteins. Two different, lysine-containing lambda 2 peptide sequences closely resemble predicted amino acid stretches in vaccinia virus guanylyltransferase and potentially form part of active sites in the viral mRNA capping enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1522892355,"The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the lacE and lacF genes, which code for the lactose-specific Enzyme II and Enzyme III of the Staphylococcus aureus phosphotransferase system, are presented. The primary translation products consist of a hydrophobic protein of 572 amino acids (Mr = 62,688) and a polypeptide of 103 amino acids (Mr = 11,372), respectively. The assignment of lacF as the gene for Enzyme IIIlac was based upon the known amino acid sequence of the protein. The identity of lacE as encoding Enzyme IIlac was based upon immunoreactivity of the cloned gene product with antibodies raised against purified Enzyme IIlac from S. aureus and an assay of biological function of the protein expressed in Escherichia coli. The order of the known genes of the S. aureus lac operon is lacF-lacE-lacG, the latter encoding phospho-beta-galactosidase."
https://openalex.org/W1481669306,"We have examined the effect of tyrosine phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor kinase on its functions. Incubation of MAP2 with the EGF receptor in the presence of ATP resulted in a great decrease in the ability of MAP2 to promote tubulin polymerization. Under a variety of conditions, the decrease in the ability correlated with the extent of phosphorylation of MAP2. Furthermore, another function of MAP2, the actin filament cross-linking activity, was also inactivated by the incubation of MAP2 with the EGF receptor and ATP. The loss of this activity also correlated well with the extent of phosphorylation. These data indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of MAP2 by the EGF receptor kinase inactivates both the tubulin polymerizing activity and actin filament cross-linking activity of MAP2. Thus, this study has clearly shown that tyrosine phosphorylation could modify the function of a cytoskeletal protein."
https://openalex.org/W1532181314,"Abstract The mechanism of the Escherichia coli mutT mutator effect was investigated using single-stranded phage as a mutational target. In vivo experiments showed that two M13mp2 lacZ alpha nonsense mutants reverted at a higher rate on a mutT1 host than on the wild-type host. The specificity of this mutator effect was identical to that observed for E. coli genes: A.T----C.G transversions. The mutT effect was subsequently demonstrated in vitro during DNA replication of M13mp2 DNA in cell-free extracts of E. coli. Replication (the single-stranded----replicative form conversion) in mutT1 extracts proceeded with a higher error rate than in wild-type extracts, and DNA sequence analysis of the in vitro revertants revealed the specific induction of A.T----C.G transversions. On the basis of the template specificity of the mutT effect in vitro, we conclude that the mutT effect involves the aberrant processing of A.G rather than T.C mispairs."
https://openalex.org/W2141694369,"Recently we have isolated a large number of chicken myosin or myosin-like heavy chain genes. Seven of these genes were placed into a subset based upon their hybridization patterns. In the present study, the sequence of the 5' end of one of the myosin heavy chain (MHC) genes, N127, was determined and compared with the 5' end sequences of the other six MHC genes in the subset. The comparison revealed that the three exons encoding the amino termini of the protein are highly conserved. The sequence analysis shows that a localized correction event occurred in and around a domain of the nucleotide-binding site, as the exon encoding this site and the preceding intron are very highly conserved among the seven genes. The sequence of the promoter and 5'-untranslated region of N127 is presented. The analogous regions for N124 and N125 have now been sequenced and are also presented. As is the case for all the other known MHC genes, the 5'-untranslated regions are split by large introns. The promoter and 5'-untranslated regions are compared with two previously characterized chicken MHC genes (N116 and N118) to determine the sequence similarities and differences that might underlie the differential expression of the family's members. To confirm and extend previously published results of the expression of these genes, transcript-specific probes generated from the 5' region of six of the seven genes were used to determine in which muscle(s) the corresponding mRNAs were present. The data show that despite the very close structural homologies, each of the genes for which a unique probe could be prepared exhibits a unique pattern of expression."
https://openalex.org/W2166979814,"Several vascular and nonvascular mammalian tissue extracts exhibited variable amounts of two peaks (peaks I and II) of cGMP-dependent protein kinase by NaCl elution of DEAE columns. When [3H]cGMP was added to the extracts before chromatography, a peak of protein-bound [3H]cGMP coeluted with peak II. [3H]cGMP was added to purified bovine lung cyclic nucleotide-free enzyme followed by chromatography on high performance liquid chromatography-DEAE. Two kinase peaks, the first of which represented mainly cGMP-free enzyme and the second of which represented cGMP-bound enzyme, eluted at the same positions as peaks I and II, respectively, of the crude extracts. The relative amount of peak II increased as a function of increasing the [3H]cGMP added before chromatography, and peak II could be converted partially to peak I by rechromatography. The holoenzyme is known to contain two slowly exchanging cGMP binding sites (sites 1) and two rapidly exchanging sites (sites 2). Some protein-bound [3H] cGMP found entirely in site 1 coeluted with peak I, although most of the enzyme in that peak was cGMP-free. When low [3H]cGMP was used for the initial incubation, relatively more of the protein-bound [3H] cGMP appeared in peak I and could represent binding of [3H]cGMP to only one of the two sites 1 of the kinase. The [3H]cGMP bound to the peak II enzyme completely filled both sites 1. Cyclic GMP binding to these sites caused the apparent conformational change which shifted the DEAE elution position of the enzyme. The peak II kinase was partially active and had a higher sensitivity to further cGMP activation of kinase than did the cGMP-free enzyme, suggesting that activation of kinase by binding of cGMP to site 2 was facilitated by prior binding at site 1. In fractions of the trailing edge of peak II, the kinase activity was virtually cGMP-independent, and both sites 1 and 2 were almost saturated with [3H]cGMP. These results suggested a further conformational change and direct increase in activity by binding of cGMP at site 2."
https://openalex.org/W1521084864,"By a new procedure, the holoenzyme of bovine heart type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase was purified to homogeneity as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). A high performance liquid chromatography-DEAE purification step resolved two distinct peaks of protein kinase activity, which were designated Peak 1 and Peak 2 based on their order of elution. The two peaks exhibited similar Stokes radii and sedimentation coefficients. They had similar ratios of regulatory to catalytic subunits both by densitometric scanning of SDS-PAGE bands and by the ratios of equilibrium [3H]cAMP binding to maximal kinase activity. These results suggested that the holoenzyme of each peak contained two regulatory subunits and two catalytic subunits, although a subpopulation of holoenzyme lacking one catalytic subunit also appeared to be present in Peak 2. Assays of cAMP indicated that the Peak 1 holoenzyme was cAMP-free, but half of the Peak 2 holoenzyme cAMP binding sites contained cAMP. Determination of [3H]cAMP dissociation rates showed that the cAMP was equally distributed in binding Site 1 and Site 2 of Peak 2. Although SDS-PAGE analysis ruled out conversions by proteolysis or autophosphorylation-dephosphorylation, Peak 1 could be partially converted to Peak 2 by the addition of subsaturating amounts of cAMP. Interconvertibility of the two holoenzyme peaks strongly suggested that the difference between the two peaks was caused by the presence of cAMP in Peak 2. Peak 2 holoenzyme, as compared to Peak 1, had enhanced binding in nonequilibrium [3H]cIMP and [3H]cAMP binding assays, as was expected due to the presence of cAMP and to the known positive cooperativity in binding of cyclic nucleotides to the kinase. The positive cooperativity in kinase activation, as indicated by the Hill coefficient, was greater for Peak 2 than Peak 1, but the cAMP concentration required for half-maximal activation (Ka) of each of the two peaks was very similar. In conclusion, Peak 2 is an inactive ternary complex of cAMP, regulatory subunit, and catalytic subunit, and Peak 1 is a cAMP-free holoenzyme. The cAMP-bound form may represent a major cellular form of the enzyme which is primed for activation."
https://openalex.org/W1520117544,"The potential involvement of vicinal dithiols in the expression of platelet-activating factor (AGEPC)- and A23187-induced alterations in rabbit platelets was explored through the use of phenylarsine oxide (PhAsO) and certain analogous derivatives. PhAsO (As3+) but not phenylarsonic acid (As5+) inhibited markedly at 1 microM concentration the release of arachidonic acid initiated by AGEPC and the ionophore A23187. In contrast, AGEPC-induced phosphatidic acid formation, phosphorylation of 40- and 20-kDa proteins, and Ca2+ uptake from external medium were not inhibited substantially by 1 microM PhAsO. However, these latter metabolic responses to AGEPC were inhibited by PhAsO at higher doses (10 microM). AGEPC- and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and serotonin secretion also were prevented by PhAsO. The IC50 value of PhAsO was 2.7 +/- 1.2 microM toward AGEPC (5 Ã— 10(-10) M)-induced serotonin release. Further, ATP and cAMP levels in PhAsO-treated platelets were not changed from controls. Interestingly, addition of Ca2+ to platelet sonicates (prepared in EDTA) caused diacylglycerol production and free arachidonic acid formation, even in the presence of 133 microM PhAsO. This would suggest that in the intact platelets PhAsO acted indirectly on phospholipase A2 and/or phospholipase C activities. Finally, a dithiol compound, 2,3-dimercaptopropanol, reversed the inhibition of platelet aggregation and arachidonic acid release effected by PhAsO. On the other hand, a monothiol compound, 2-mercaptoethanol, was not effective in preventing or in reversing the action of PhAsO. These observations suggest that vicinal sulfhydryl residues may be involved in stimulus-induced platelet activation."
https://openalex.org/W1552057692,"Abstract The gene encoding the beta subunit of mouse thyrotropin (TSH beta) has been isolated from a mouse genomic library, and its nucleotide sequence has been determined. Blot hybridization analysis of restriction enzyme digests of mouse DNA indicates that there is a single mouse TSH beta gene. The gene is 4.8 kilobases in length and contains five exons, which are 27, 47, 41, 163, and 328 base pairs long. Exons 1, 2, and 3 encode only 5'-untranslated mRNA sequences and are separated by introns that are 150 and 380 base pairs long. The protein-coding mRNA sequences are found in exons 4 and 5 and are interrupted by a 460-base pair intron. The position of this intron, between the codons for amino acids 34 and 35, has been conserved in all the known glycoprotein hormone beta subunit genes. Exons 3 and 4 are separated by a large 3.2-kilobase intron. When primer extension analysis, using an oligonucleotide primer complementary to exon 4 sequences, was employed to locate the transcription start site, four products were obtained. Nucleotide sequencing of these products showed that they were derived from separate TSH beta mRNAs that differed in the lengths of their 5'-untranslated regions. These 5'-untranslated mRNA sequences are derived from different combinations of exons 1, 2, and 3, each spliced to exons 4 and 5. The longest 5'-untranslated sequence, 116 nucleotides long, includes exons 1, 2, and 3 and the first base of exon 4; the shorter 5'-untranslated regions, 75, 69, and 28 nucleotides long, arise by splicing out the second and/or the third exon sequences. In contrast to the mouse TSH beta gene, transcription of the rat TSH beta gene from the analogous start site has been reported to give only a single mRNA, with a 5'-untranslated region of 28 nucleotides. Divergence of the mouse and rat TSH beta gene sequences at RNA splice sites can account for the absence of exon 2, but not exon 3, sequences in rat TSH beta mRNA. Primer extension and RNase protection analyses also showed that the mouse TSH beta gene contains a second transcription start site, located 43 base pairs upstream of the first start site, in a position corresponding to that in the rat TSH beta gene. Each start site in the mouse gene is flanked by characteristic TATAA box and CAAT box sequences.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1526966570,"Two integral membrane proteins, influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) and vesicular stomatitis virus G protein, are transported to and accumulated on the apical and basolateral surfaces, respectively, of the plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells. We have used chimeric constructions to identify the domains of HA and G proteins which contain the signals for polarized transport. Previously, we have shown that a chimeric protein containing the cleavable leader and the ectodomain of HA fused to the anchoring and cytoplasmic domains of G is transported to the apical surface of polarized MDCK cells (McQueen, N.L., Nayak, D.P., Stephens, E.B., and Compans, R.W. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83, 9318-9322). In this report we show that a chimera containing the cleavable leader and ectodomain of G fused to the anchoring and cytoplasmic domains of HA is transported to the basolateral surface of polarized cells. Another chimera which contains the leader sequence of G fused to leader minus HA is transported to the apical surface of polarized cells. These results taken together suggest that the signals for the polarized transport of HA and G proteins may reside in their ectodomains."
https://openalex.org/W49806421,"We have examined, by use of isolated canine hepatocytes and selected hormone analogs, the mechanisms by which glucagon modifies the accumulation of cellular cAMP. Low concentrations of glucagon (less than or equal to 3 nM) enhanced the accumulation of hepatocyte cAMP, whereas higher concentrations of the hormone diminished the effectiveness of lower ones. This biphasic concentration dependence was observed as well for some glucagon analogs, but not for others, and was apparent for cells incubated in the presence or absence of theophylline. Glucagon at high concentrations (greater than or equal to 10 nM) also inhibited the accumulation of cAMP induced by isoproterenol. The inhibitory effect of glucagon in both of these systems was reversed or attenuated by cell incubations involving the use of pertussis toxin (islet-activating protein) or a peptide antagonist of the glucagon-adenylyl cyclase system. We conclude that (a) glucagon, through its interaction with high and low affinity binding sites, can either stimulate or inhibit the production of hepatocyte cAMP; (b) the inhibitory action of the hormone appears to arise from interactions of ligand with a subset of these binding sites and to require structural characteristics in addition to those that determine receptor binding affinity per se; and (c) the glucagon and adrenergic systems involved in stimulating cAMP accumulation are linked, at least with regard to the negative effect induced by high concentrations of glucagon."
https://openalex.org/W90524757,"The effect of chaotropic anions was studied on processes that constitute the chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase reaction, i.e. enzyme activation and catalysis. The specific activity of chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase was enhanced by preincubation with dithiothreitol, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, Ca2+, and a chaotropic anion. When chaotropes were ranked in the order of increasing concentrations required for maximal activation they followed a lyotropic (Hofmeister) series: SCN- less than Cl3C-COO- less than ClO4- less than I- less than Br- less than Cl- less than SO4(2-). On the contrary, salts inhibited the catalytic step. The stimulation of chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase by chaotropic anions arose from a decrease of the activation kinetic constants of both fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and Ca2+; on the other hand, in catalysis neutral salts caused a decrease of kcat because the S0.5 for both fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and Mg2+ remained unaltered. The molecular weight of chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase did not change after the activation by incubation with dithiothreitol, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, Ca2+, and a chaotrope; consequently, the action of these modulators altered the conformation of the enzyme. Modification in the relative position of aromatic residues of chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase was detected by UV differential spectroscopy. In addition, the concerted action of modulators made the enzyme more sensitive to (a) trypsin attack and (b) S-carboxymethylation by iodoacetamide. These results provide a new insight on the mechanism of light-mediated regulation of chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase; concurrently to the action of a sugar bisphosphate, a bivalent cation, and a reductant, modifications of hydrophobic interactions in the structure of chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase play a crucial role in the enhancement of the specific activity."
https://openalex.org/W136965677,"In Escherichia coli, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is regulated by reversible phosphorylation. The bifunctional enzyme which catalyzes this phosphorylation cycle, IDH kinase/phosphatase, also exhibits a specific ATPase activity. Mutant derivatives of this protein which are nearly devoid of IDH phosphatase activity retain both IDH kinase and ATPase activity, indicating that ATP hydrolysis does not result from the cyclic phosphorylation of IDH. However, the IDH kinase and ATPase activities of these mutant proteins differ significantly from those of the wild-type IDH kinase/phosphatase expressed from the parental allele. This observation suggest that IDH kinase and IDH phosphatase do not reside on structurally independent domains. In contrast to many enzymes which catalyze kinetically unfavorable side reactions, the maximum velocity of the ATPase substantially exceeded those of IDH kinase and IDH phosphatase. ATP hydrolysis was only partially inhibited by phospho- and dephospho-IDH, with saturating levels of phospho-IDH decreasing the rate of ATP hydrolysis by a factor of approximately 5. Even in the presence of near-saturating concentrations of phospho-IDH, the rate of ATP hydrolysis was 4-fold greater than the rate of the cyclic phosphorylation of IDH."
https://openalex.org/W175540431,"The purified endonuclease of bovine heart mitochondria shows a remarkable preference for a specific site in bovine mtDNA. This site was identified using a recombinant DNA template which includes a 4.9-kilobase portion of the 16-kilobase bovine mitochondrial sequence encompassing all of the displacement loop region. The endonucleolytic target corresponds to an evolutionarily conserved sequence tract of 12 consecutive guanine residues that is found in an otherwise highly divergent domain of the mitochondrial displacement loop region. The preference for this site is several hundred-fold greater than other less favored sites. Unlike other less prominent cleavage loci, the conserved sequence tract is readily nicked in either or both DNA strands, even at 0 degrees C. These findings suggest that there is a specific interaction of the endonuclease with this site in vivo that may be important for mtDNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1650862839,"Phorbol esters such as phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) were employed to examine the involvement of protein kinase C in the regulation of protein synthesis in intact GH3 pituitary tumor cells. Amino acid incorporation increased as a function of time of pretreatment with these agents; 4-8- and 2-3-fold stimulations were observed for Ca2+-depleted and -restored preparations, respectively, following 2 h of exposure. PMA enhanced incorporation of amino acid into all detectable polypeptide species. Lysates of PMA-treated cells incorporated amino acid more efficiently than did lysates of untreated controls. Cells slowed at initiation by Ca2+ depletion responded to treatment with PMA with the production of low molecular weight polysomes and a concomitant decrease in 80 S monomers. In Ca2+-restored preparations, which form large polysomes, PMA treatment resulted in a decrease in 80 S monomers and a shift in average polysomal size from smaller to larger molecular weight. Ribosomal transit times, however, were not altered. PMA-stimulated amino acid incorporation and polysome formation were either eliminated or reduced significantly by actinomycin D and could not be ascribed to increased amino acid uptake or methionylation of tRNA. Substances which elevate cAMP in GH3 cells mimicked phorbol ester in its actions on protein synthesis. It is proposed that GH3 cells, in response to various stimuli, rapidly synthesize an mRNA that subsequently increases the synthesis of a rate-limiting component of translational initiation. Evidence that this pathway for translational control may function in alternative cell types is also presented."
https://openalex.org/W1577035136,"Abstract ATP sulfurylase from Penicillium chrysogenum is a noncooperative homooligomer containing three free sulfhydryl groups per subunit. Under nondenaturing conditions, one SH group per subunit was modified by 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate), or N-ethylmaleimide. Modification had only a small effect on kcat, but markedly increased the [S]0.5 values for the substrates, MgATP and SO4(2-). MgATP and adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate protected against modification. The SH-modified enzyme displayed sigmoidal velocity curves for both substrates with Hill coefficients (nH) of 2. Fluorosulfonate (FSO3-) and other dead-end inhibitors competitive with SO4(2-) activated the SH-modified enzyme at low SO4(2-) concentration. In order to determine whether the sigmoidicity resulted from true cooperative binding (as opposed to a kinetically based mechanism), the shapes of the binding curves were established from the degree of protection provided by a ligand against phenylglyoxal-dependent irreversible inactivation under noncatalytic conditions. Under standard conditions (0.05 M Na-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N'-3-propanesulfonic acid buffer, pH 8, 30 degrees C, and 3mM phenylglyoxal) the native enzyme was inactivated with a k of 2.67 +/- 0.25 X 10-3 s-1, whereas k for the SH-modified enzyme was 5.44 +/- 0.27 X 10-3 s-1. The increased sensitivity of the modified enzyme resulted from increased reactivity of ligand-protectable groups. Both the native and the SH-modified enzyme displayed hyperbolic plots of delta k (i.e. protection) versus [MgATP], or [FSO3-], or [S2O3(2-]) in the absence of coligand (nH = 0.98 +/- 0.06). The plots of delta k versus [ligand] for the native enzyme were also hyperbolic in the presence of a fixed concentration of coligand. However, in the presence of a fixed [FSO3-] or [S2O3(2-]), the delta k versus [MgATP] plot for the SH-modified enzyme was sigmoidal, as was the plot of delta k versus [FSO3-] or [S2O3(2-]) in the presence of a fixed [MgATP]. The nH values were 1.92 +/- 0.09. The results indicate that substrates (or analogs) bind hyperbolically to unoccupied SH-modified subunits, but in a subunit-cooperative fashion to form a ternary complex."
https://openalex.org/W1557307826,"Rat lung membrane vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) receptors were covalently labeled with 125I-VIP, extracted in Triton X-100 and n-octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside, and analyzed by gel filtration and sucrose density gradient sedimentation. The fractions were characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, and the identity of the 125I-VIP.receptor complex was demonstrated by its co-migration with the covalently labeled 55-kDa receptor unit identified previously. Furthermore, the radioactivity in the peak corresponding to the 125I-VIP.receptor complex was displaced in the presence of unlabeled VIP in a dose-dependent manner. The following hydrodynamic properties were determined for VIP receptors in each detergent solution: in Triton X-100, Stokes radius of 6.1 +/- 0.4 nm, sedimentation coefficient (S20,w) of 7.35 +/- 0.45 S, and partial specific volume (v) of 0.809 +/- 0.015 ml/g; in n-octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside, Stokes radius of 5.6 +/- 0.00 nm, S20,w of 10.87 +/- 0.22 S, and partial specific volume of 0.783 +/- 0.020 ml/g. The apparent molecular weight of the 125I-VIP.receptor.detergent complex was calculated as 270,000 +/- 36,000 in Triton X-100 and 320,000 +/- 32,000 in n-octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside. The amount of detergent bound to the receptor was estimated by using the two sets of hydrodynamic data and the significantly different partial specific volumes of the two detergents. Thus, the molecular weight of the receptor alone was calculated as 54,600 daltons, indicating that approximately 3.9 g of Triton X-100 and 4.9 g of n-octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside were bound per g of receptor. This species contained the 55-kDa binding unit and appeared to be glycosylated as evidenced by its specific binding to wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose. These results indicate that the rat lung VIP receptor is a glycoprotein with a single polypeptide chain of 55 kDa. The large amount of detergent bound suggests that the receptor is extensively embedded in the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2468406986,"Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium preferentially utilize sugar substrates of the phosphoenol-pyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system (PTS) when the growth medium also contains other sugars. This phenomenon, diauxic growth, is regulated by the crr gene, which encodes the PTS protein IIIGlc (Saffen, D.W., Presper, K.A., Doering, T.L., and Roseman, S. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 16241-16253). We have proposed that non-PTS permeases are regulated by their interaction with IIIGlc, and in vitro studies from other laboratories have provided support for this model, but the in vivo effects of excess IIIGlc are not known. In the present studies, transformed cells that overproduced IIIGlc 2- and 10-fold, respectively, were constructed from a pts+ strain of E. coli and plasmids containing the crr gene. In the 2-fold overproducer, fermentation of, and growth on the non-PTS carbohydrates glycerol, lactose, maltose, and melibiose was generally more sensitive to the glucose analogue methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside than in a control strain containing normal levels of IIIGlc. In addition, inhibition of lactose permease activity by methyl-alpha-glucoside (inducer exclusion) was more effective in the 2-fold overproducer than in the control strain, particularly when the permease activity was high. The 10-fold IIIGlc overproducing strain had a requirement for the amino acids methionine, isoleucine, leucine, and valine that may or may not be related to the increased concentration of IIIGlc. Fermentation of non-PTS carbohydrates was also poor in the latter strain. Finally, lactose permease activity was 50% of that in control cells containing the same levels of beta-galactosidase, and the lactose permease activity in the IIIGlc overproducer was reduced to an extremely low level in the presence of methyl alpha-glucoside. Thus there is an inverse relationship between the cellular concentration of IIIGlc and the ability to metabolize non-PTS substrates. The results are consistent with the model where inducer exclusion is affected by a direct interaction between IIIGlc and a non-PTS transport system."
https://openalex.org/W96196044,"The bisphosphatase domain of the rat liver 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase has been shown to exhibit a structural similarity to yeast phosphoglycerate mutase and human red blood cell 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate mutase including very similar active site sequences with a histidyl residue being involved in phospho group transfer. The liver bifunctional enzyme was found to catalyze the hydrolysis of glycerate 1,3-bisphosphate to glycerate 3-phosphate and inorganic phosphate. The Km for glycerate 1,3-bisphosphate was 320 microM and the Vmax was 11.5 milliunits/mg. Incubation of the rat liver enzyme with [1-32P]glycerate 1,3-bisphosphate resulted in the formation of a phosphoenzyme intermediate, and the labeled amino acid was identified as 3-phosphohistidine. Tryptic and endoproteinase Lys-C peptide maps of the 32P-phosphoenzyme labeled either with [2-32P]fructose 2,6-bisphosphate or [1-32P]glycerate 1,3-bisphosphate revealed that 32P-radioactivity was found in the same peptide, proving that the same histidyl group accepts phosphate from both substrates. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate inhibited competitively the formation of phosphoenzyme from [1-32P]glycerate 1,3-bisphosphate. Effectors of fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase also inhibited phosphoenzyme formation. Substrates and products of phosphoglycerate mutase and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate mutase also modulated the activities of the bifunctional enzyme. These results demonstrate that, in addition to a structural homology, the bisphosphatase domain of the bifunctional enzyme has a functional similarity to phosphoglycerate mutase and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate mutase and support the concept of an evolutionary relationship between the three enzyme activities."
https://openalex.org/W1522568592,"Abstract The properties of the adenylate cyclase from forskolin-resistant mutants of Y1 adrenocortical tumor cells was compared with the properties of the enzyme from parental Y1 cells in order to localize the site of mutation. In parental Y1 cells, forskolin stimulated adenylate cyclase activity with kinetics suggestive of an interaction at two sites; in mutant cells, forskolin resistance was characterized by a decrease in enzymatic activity at both sites. Forskolin potentiated the enzyme's responses to NaF and guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) in parent and mutant clones, and the mutant enzyme showed the same requirements for Mg2+ and Mn2+ as did the parent enzyme. The adenylate cyclase associated with forskolin-resistant mutants was insensitive to ACTH and was less responsive to Gpp(NH)p than was the parent enzyme. In parental Y1 cells and in the forskolin-resistant mutants, cholera toxin catalyzed the transfer of [32P]ADP-ribose from [32P]NAD+ into three membrane proteins associated with the alpha subunit of Gs; however, the amount of labeled ADP-ribose incorporated into mutant membranes was reduced by as much as 70%. Both parent and mutant membranes were labeled by pertussis toxin to the same extent. The insensitivity of the mutant adenylate cyclase to ACTH and Gpp(NH)p and the selective resistance of the mutant membranes to cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation suggest that a specific defect associated with Gs is involved in the mutation to forskolin resistance in Y1 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1577519661,"Calmodulin and calmodulin complexed with calcineurin phosphatase were trace labeled with [3H]acetic anhydride and the incorporation of [3H]acetate into each epsilon-amino lysine of calmodulin was measured. The relative reactivities of calmodulin lysines were higher in the presence of Ca2+ than in the presence of EGTA, and the order was: Lys-75 greater than Lys-94 greater than Lys-148 greater than or equal to Lys-77 greater than Lys-13 greater than or equal to Lys-21 greater than Lys-30. The changes in relative reactivity implied a change in conformation. When calmodulin was complexed with the phosphatase, Lys-21, Lys-77, and Lys-148 were most protected, implying that these residues are at or near the interaction sites or are conformationally perturbed by the interaction. Lys-30 and Lys-75 were slightly protected, lysine 13 showed no change, while lysine 94 significantly increased in reactivity. Comparison with results obtained from myosin light chain kinase using a similar technique (Jackson, A. E., Carraway, K. L., III, Puett, D., and Brew, K. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 12226-12232) reveals that calmodulin may interact with each of the two enzymes similarly at or near Lys-21, Lys-75, and Lys-148; one difference with phosphatase is that complex formation also involved Lys-77. These findings suggest that calmodulin interacts differently with its target enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1486135387,"Abstract We have studied samples of oxidized (as isolated) cytochrome c1aa3 from Thermus thermophilus in the pH range 5.7 to 9.3 with Mossbauer spectroscopy. In this pH range, the spectra of cytochromes c1 and a are independent of pH, whereas the spectra of cytochrome a3 are not. Most importantly, spectra taken in applied fields up to 6.0 T reveal the presence of multiple ferric forms of cytochrome a3. At any given pH value, at least two high-spin ferric cytochrome a3 species can be distinguished; in addition, most samples contain a low-spin ferric cytochrome a3 species (less than 20% of cytochrome a3). The Mossbauer spectra show clearly that all forms of cytochrome a3 are spin coupled (to CuB). We have analyzed the high field (H greater than or equal to 1.5 tesla) spectra of a sample at pH 6.5 in the framework of a model that considers isotropic exchange-coupling, JS1.S2, between a high-spin ferric (S1 = 5/2) cytochrome a3 and cupric CuB (S2 = 1/2). In strong applied fields, the spectra can be fitted with any value for J greater than or equal to 0.5 cm-1. In the strong coupling case (J/D1 approximately greater than 3), a zero field splitting parameter D1 approximately 2.5 cm-1 is required for cytochrome a3; this value is distinctly smaller than those observed for high-spin ferric hemes (4-20 cm-1). A model assuming weak coupling magnitude of J approximately 1 cm-1, yields D1 approximately 8 cm-1 and a parameter set for cytochrome a3 quite similar to that reported for metmyoglobin. A J-value of approximately 1 cm-1 does not demand the presence of a ligand bridging between cytochrome a3 and CuB."
https://openalex.org/W1495054277,"When 32P-labeled phosphoenolpyruvate is injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes, a 50-60-kDa protein of subunit size Mr 29,000 is rapidly labeled, followed by a second (monomeric) protein of 66 kDa concomitant with the loss of label from the first protein. We have identified these proteins as, respectively, the glycolytic enzymes phosphoglyceromutase and phosphoglucomutase. The phosphoglyceromutase is labeled at a histidine and the phosphoglucomutase at a serine, presumably at their active sites during the gluconeogenic transformation of phosphoenolpyruvate into glycogen. The transfer of the 32P label from phosphoenolpyruvate to these two enzymes also occurs in in vitro lysates made from full-grown Xenopus oocytes, eggs, or early embryos, but with a slower time course. Lysates prepared from leg muscle show labeling of the phosphoglyceromutase, but not the phosphoglucomutase, when incubated with [32P]phosphoenolpyruvate. This last result is expected in tissues showing metabolic flux largely in the glycolytic direction. The data indicate that in full-grown oocytes and embryos metabolic flux occurs largely in the gluconeogenic direction."
https://openalex.org/W1485925794,"Addition of high density lipoprotein 3 (HDL3) isolated from human plasma of d greater than 1.125 g/ml which had been preincubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C enhanced steroidogenesis by cultured rat adrenal cells only 38% as well as HDL3 isolated from unincubated plasma. Loss of steroidogenic activity due to preincubation was associated with a decrease in the percent HDL3 cholesterol remaining unesterified. Inhibition of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity by heating (60 degrees C, 1 h) or addition of dithionitrobenzoic acid (1.4 mM) prevented esterification of cholesterol in HDL and also prevented loss of steroidogenic activity. Although incubation of plasma of d greater than 1.125 g/ml prior to isolation caused cholesterol esterification, there was no change in the ratio of total cholesterol to protein in HDL, size and shape of the HDL particle as assayed by measurement of sedimentation velocity, nor affinity for the putative HDL receptor. Addition of unesterified cholesterol to preincubated HDL restored steroidogenic activity. These results indicate that unesterified cholesterol in HDL is preferentially used as substrate for rat adrenal steroidogenesis. The effects of nonlipoprotein serum proteins on HDL action in the adrenal were also examined. The ability of HDL3 to enhance rat adrenal steroidogenesis was not significantly less in serum-free media than in media supplemented with lipoprotein-poor fetal calf serum or human plasma of d greater than 1.21 g/ml, suggesting that rat adrenal uptake of HDL cholesterol does not depend on participation of plasma enzymes or transport proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1601137540,"We have used glucagon and nine glucagon analogs to investigate the interactions of these ligands with glucagon-binding sites present on isolated canine hepatocytes. Curves reflecting the inhibition of 125I-labeled glucagon or 125I-labeled analog binding to cells by the 10 peptides spanned, overall, a 10(6)-fold range of hormone concentration, were consistent with hormone binding to two classes of binding sites in each case, and fell into two groups, one of which contained curves that were considerably more shallow than the other. Only conditions that emphasized prior binding to low affinity sites resulted in the rapid and extensive dissociation of receptor-bound ligand from isolated cells. Finally, all 10 peptides exhibited a concentration-dependent inhibition of the incorporation of [14C]fructose into hepatocyte glycogen that correlated best with dissociation constants for high affinity rather than for low affinity binding. We conclude that (a) the association of ligand with the high and low affinity glucagon-binding sites of isolated canine hepatocytes is a characteristic of analogs modified at diverse sites throughout the peptide hormone, (b) the different rates of dissociation of ligand from the two populations of binding sites most probably account for the biphasic dissociation of ligand from isolated cells and for the different affinities of the two receptor populations for ligand, and (c) the activity of glucagon and glucagon analogs to inhibit the incorporation of fructose into hepatocyte glycogen arises from the association of ligand with high affinity binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1504022535,"Rat liver fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase was phosphorylated with [32P]ATP and the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. After digestion with trypsin, two peptides were isolated containing 68 and 32% of the total radioactivity, respectively. The former was found to contain the sequence Ala-Lys-Ser(P)-Arg-Pro-Ser(P)-Leu-Pro. In this fragment, Ser-341, but not Ser-338, had earlier been reported to be a phosphorylation site. The other peptide contained phosphorylated Ser-356. It was demonstrated that all the protein-bound [32P]phosphate was distributed evenly between these three serines in the native enzyme regardless of the degree of phosphorylation. Preservation of the three-dimensional structure, however, was needed to obtain phosphorylation of Ser-356. Peptides containing each phosphorylatable serine residue were sequentially removed by digesting the enzyme with chymotrypsin which cleaved off Ser-356, denaturing it with urea, digesting it further with chymotrypsin, thus removing Ser-341, and finally treating it with trypsin which eliminated the rest of the radioactivity which was bound to Ser-338. Kinetic studies of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase digested in this manner revealed that phosphorylation of Ser-338 decreased the apparent Km for fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, whereas phosphorylation of Ser-341 decreased the inhibitory effect of AMP and fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase, Phosphorylation of Ser-356 did not affect these parameters."
https://openalex.org/W169223502,"The kinetics of induction and decay of the antiviral state and polypeptide p54 expression induced by recombinant human interferon gamma (rIFN-gamma) were examined in human amnion U cells. The kinetics of induction of the antiviral state, as measured by the single-cycle yield reduction of vesicular stomatitis virus, were first order over the period of about 6-12 h following a lag of about 2-4 h. The induction of p54 synthesis by rIFN-gamma slightly preceded the induction of the antiviral state. The kinetics of p54 induction were first order over a period of about 2-8 h after a lag of about 1 h. The rate of polypeptide p54 synthesis induced by rIFN-gamma decayed significantly within 1 day after the removal of IFN. However, polypeptide p54 was comparatively stable, displaying a half-life of about 3 days. The antiviral state likewise decayed significantly within 3-4 days following removal of IFN-gamma, and by 5-8 days, the virus yields were comparable to those of untreated control cell cultures. These results suggest that polypeptide p54 may play an important role in the antiviral action of rIFN-gamma in human amnion U cells."
