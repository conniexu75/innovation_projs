https://openalex.org/W1977039417,"The stimulation of a subset of surface Toll-like receptors (TLRs), transmembrane proteins of the innate immune system that recognize microbe-derived molecules, is shown to induce production of reactive oxygen for bacterial killing by the mitochondrial pathway. When the 'bacterial' TLRs (TLR1, 2 and 4) bind to a ligand they promote the recruitment of mitochondria to macrophage phagosomes and induce upregulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS). This work implicates mROS as important components of antibacterial responses and further establishes mitochondria as hubs for innate immune signalling. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential components of the innate immune response against intracellular bacteria and it is thought that professional phagocytes generate ROS primarily via the phagosomal NADPH oxidase machinery1. However, recent studies have suggested that mitochondrial ROS (mROS) also contribute to mouse macrophage bactericidal activity, although the mechanisms linking innate immune signalling to mitochondria for mROS generation remain unclear2,3,4. Here we demonstrate that engagement of a subset of Toll-like receptors (TLR1, TLR2 and TLR4) results in the recruitment of mitochondria to macrophage phagosomes and augments mROS production. This response involves translocation of a TLR signalling adaptor, tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), to mitochondria, where it engages the protein ECSIT (evolutionarily conserved signalling intermediate in Toll pathways), which is implicated in mitochondrial respiratory chain assembly5. Interaction with TRAF6 leads to ECSIT ubiquitination and enrichment at the mitochondrial periphery, resulting in increased mitochondrial and cellular ROS generation. ECSIT- and TRAF6-depleted macrophages have decreased levels of TLR-induced ROS and are significantly impaired in their ability to kill intracellular bacteria. Additionally, reducing macrophage mROS levels by expressing catalase in mitochondria results in defective bacterial killing, confirming the role of mROS in bactericidal activity. These results reveal a novel pathway linking innate immune signalling to mitochondria, implicate mROS as an important component of antibacterial responses and further establish mitochondria as hubs for innate immune signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2039029351,"In an awake state, neurons in the cerebral cortex fire irregularly and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings display low-amplitude, high-frequency fluctuations. During sleep, neurons oscillate between ‘on’ periods, when they fire as in an awake brain, and ‘off’ periods, when they stop firing altogether and the EEG displays high-amplitude slow waves. However, what happens to neuronal firing after a long period of being awake is not known. Here we show that in freely behaving rats after a long period in an awake state, cortical neurons can go briefly ‘offline’ as in sleep, accompanied by slow waves in the local EEG. Neurons often go offline in one cortical area but not in another, and during these periods of ‘local sleep’, the incidence of which increases with the duration of the awake state, rats are active and display an ‘awake’ EEG. However, they are progressively impaired in a sugar pellet reaching task. Thus, although both the EEG and behaviour indicate wakefulness, local populations of neurons in the cortex may be falling asleep, with negative consequences for performance. Neural activity is strikingly different between the sleep and awake states, but little is known about how activity relates to the transitions between states, or whether it changes in response to wake duration. Tononi and colleagues present evidence that in behaviourally awake rats, especially after prolonged waking, cortical neurons can transiently go 'off-line' as in sleep, but in a local, piecemeal fashion. In tests in which rats were trained to reach for a sugar pellet as a food reward, performance in the task was impaired during the sleep-like state."
https://openalex.org/W2004336750,"Invading microbes are detected and ingested by white blood cells known as phagocytes. To do this they must distinguish between soluble microbe-derived components, such as pieces of cell wall, and the particulate microbes themselves. A study of the action of Dectin-1, an innate immune receptor that detects invading fungal pathogens, shows that although the receptor binds to both soluble and particulate cell-wall β-glucans, its activation is restricted to sites of contact with fungal cell walls by the formation of 'phagocytic synapses'. The phagocytic synapse provides a mechanistic model for the specific detection of ligands associated with a microbial surface, as opposed to those released from microbes at a distance. Innate immune cells must be able to distinguish between direct binding to microbes and detection of components shed from the surface of microbes located at a distance. Dectin-1 (also known as CLEC7A) is a pattern-recognition receptor expressed by myeloid phagocytes (macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils) that detects β-glucans in fungal cell walls and triggers direct cellular antimicrobial activity, including phagocytosis and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)1,2. In contrast to inflammatory responses stimulated upon detection of soluble ligands by other pattern-recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), these responses are only useful when a cell comes into direct contact with a microbe and must not be spuriously activated by soluble stimuli. In this study we show that, despite its ability to bind both soluble and particulate β-glucan polymers, Dectin-1 signalling is only activated by particulate β-glucans, which cluster the receptor in synapse-like structures from which regulatory tyrosine phosphatases CD45 and CD148 (also known as PTPRC and PTPRJ, respectively) are excluded (Supplementary Fig. 1). The ‘phagocytic synapse’ now provides a model mechanism by which innate immune receptors can distinguish direct microbial contact from detection of microbes at a distance, thereby initiating direct cellular antimicrobial responses only when they are required."

https://openalex.org/W1970998089,"Predictive habitat models are increasingly being used by conservationists, researchers and governmental bodies to identify vulnerable ecosystems and species' distributions in areas that have not been sampled. However, in the deep sea, several limitations have restricted the widespread utilisation of this approach. These range from issues with the accuracy of species presences, the lack of reliable absence data and the limited spatial resolution of environmental factors known or thought to control deep-sea species' distributions. To address these problems, global habitat suitability models have been generated for five species of framework-forming scleractinian corals by taking the best available data and using a novel approach to generate high resolution maps of seafloor conditions. High-resolution global bathymetry was used to resample gridded data from sources such as World Ocean Atlas to produce continuous 30-arc second (∼1 km(2)) global grids for environmental, chemical and physical data of the world's oceans. The increased area and resolution of the environmental variables resulted in a greater number of coral presence records being incorporated into habitat models and higher accuracy of model predictions. The most important factors in determining cold-water coral habitat suitability were depth, temperature, aragonite saturation state and salinity. Model outputs indicated the majority of suitable coral habitat is likely to occur on the continental shelves and slopes of the Atlantic, South Pacific and Indian Oceans. The North Pacific has very little suitable scleractinian coral habitat. Numerous small scale features (i.e., seamounts), which have not been sampled or identified as having a high probability of supporting cold-water coral habitat were identified in all ocean basins. Field validation of newly identified areas is needed to determine the accuracy of model results, assess the utility of modelling efforts to identify vulnerable marine ecosystems for inclusion in future marine protected areas and reduce coral bycatch by commercial fisheries."

https://openalex.org/W2060709606,"Background Rodent studies show that neurogenesis is necessary for mediating the salutary effects of antidepressants. Nonhuman primate (NHP) studies may bridge important rodent findings to the clinical realm since NHP-depression shares significant homology with human depression and kinetics of primate neurogenesis differ from those in rodents. After demonstrating that antidepressants can stimulate neurogenesis in NHPs, our present study examines whether neurogenesis is required for antidepressant efficacy in NHPs. Materials/Methodology Adult female bonnets were randomized to three social pens (N = 6 each). Pen-1 subjects were exposed to control-conditions for 15 weeks with half receiving the antidepressant fluoxetine and the rest receiving saline-placebo. Pen-2 subjects were exposed to 15 weeks of separation-stress with half receiving fluoxetine and half receiving placebo. Pen-3 subjects 2 weeks of irradiation (N = 4) or sham-irradiation (N = 2) and then exposed to 15 weeks of stress and fluoxetine. Dependent measures were weekly behavioral observations and postmortem neurogenesis levels. Results Exposing NHPs to repeated separation stress resulted in depression-like behaviors (anhedonia and subordinance) accompanied by reduced hippocampal neurogenesis. Treatment with fluoxetine stimulated neurogenesis and prevented the emergence of depression-like behaviors. Ablation of neurogenesis with irradiation abolished the therapeutic effects of fluoxetine. Non-stressed controls had normative behaviors although the fluoxetine-treated controls had higher neurogenesis rates. Across all groups, depression-like behaviors were associated with decreased rates of neurogenesis but this inverse correlation was only significant for new neurons in the anterior dentate gyrus that were at the threshold of completing maturation. Conclusion We provide evidence that induction of neurogenesis is integral to the therapeutic effects of fluoxetine in NHPs. Given the similarity between monkeys and humans, hippocampal neurogenesis likely plays a similar role in the treatment of clinical depression. Future studies will examine several outstanding questions such as whether neuro-suppression is sufficient for producing depression and whether therapeutic neuroplastic effects of fluoxetine are specific to antidepressants."
https://openalex.org/W2048580389,"Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of bloodstream infections worldwide. In the United States, many of these infections are caused by a strain known as USA300. Although progress has been made, our understanding of the S. aureus molecules that promote survival in human blood and ultimately facilitate metastases is incomplete. To that end, we analyzed the USA300 transcriptome during culture in human blood, human serum, and trypticase soy broth (TSB), a standard laboratory culture media. Notably, genes encoding several cytolytic toxins were up-regulated in human blood over time, and hlgA, hlgB, and hlgC (encoding gamma-hemolysin subunits HlgA, HlgB, and HlgC) were among the most highly up-regulated genes at all time points. Compared to culture supernatants from a wild-type USA300 strain (LAC), those derived from an isogenic hlgABC-deletion strain (LACΔhlgABC) had significantly reduced capacity to form pores in human neutrophils and ultimately cause neutrophil lysis. Moreover, LACΔhlgABC had modestly reduced ability to cause mortality in a mouse bacteremia model. On the other hand, wild-type and LACΔhlgABC strains caused virtually identical abscesses in a mouse skin infection model, and bacterial survival and neutrophil lysis after phagocytosis in vitro was similar between these strains. Comparison of the cytolytic capacity of culture supernatants from wild-type and isogenic deletion strains lacking hlgABC, lukS/F-PV (encoding PVL), and/or lukDE revealed functional redundancy among two-component leukotoxins in vitro. These findings, along with a requirement of specific growth conditions for leukotoxin expression, may explain the apparent limited contribution of any single two-component leukotoxin to USA300 immune evasion and virulence."
https://openalex.org/W1966079664,"Inhalation of nanoparticles has been implicated in respiratory morbidity and mortality. In particular, carbon black nanoparticles are found in many different environmental exposures. Macrophages take up inhaled nanoparticles and respond via release of inflammatory mediators and in some cases cell death. Based on new data, we propose that exposure of macrophages (both a macrophage cell line and primary human alveolar macrophages) to carbon black nanoparticles induces pyroptosis, an inflammasome-dependent form of cell death. Exposure of macrophages to carbon black nanoparticles resulted in inflammasome activation as defined by cleavage of caspase 1 to its active form and downstream IL-1β release. The cell death that occurred with carbon black nanoparticle exposure was identified as pyroptosis by the protective effect of a caspase 1 inhibitor and a pyroptosis inhibitor. These data demonstrate that carbon black nanoparticle exposure activates caspase 1, increases IL-1β release after LPS priming, and induces the proinflammatory cell death, pyroptosis. The identification of pyroptosis as a cellular response to carbon nanoparticle exposure is novel and relates to environmental and health impacts of carbon-based particulates.

The identification of pyroptosis as a cellular response to carbon nanoparticle exposure is novel and relates to environmental and health impacts of carbon-based particulates. Macrophages are critical regulators of local immune homeostasis. They are highly adaptive components of the innate immune system and respond in diverse ways to pathogens and other potential danger signals (1Opitz B. van Laak V. Eitel J. Suttorp N. Am. J. Respir.

In the lung, the alveolar macrophage is the first line of defense against environmental exposures. Alveolar macrophages phagocytose particulate matter, release inflammatory cytokines, and interact with other cells and molecules through the expression of surface receptors. One way in which an immune response is generated in alveolar macrophages is through the phagocytosis of deposited particles within the respiratory tract (4Sibille Y. Reynolds H.Y. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1990; 141: 471-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). The nanoparticle industry has expanded substantially in recent years. A variety of engineered carbon nanoparticles is used in consumer products such as car tires, rubber, and printer toner cartridges (5Loeffler J. Hedderich R. Fiedeler U. Malsch I. Túquerres G. Koskinen J. Linden M. Lojkowski W. Moritz T. Zins M. Bernabeu E. Larena A. Nanoroad SME European Project. European Union, Brussels, Belgium2010Google Scholar). Nanoparticles are also being used as novel means of drug delivery. Additionally, carbonaceous nanoparticles are present as an environmental contaminant. Combustion processes are a significant source of carbon nanoparticles. Elemental carbon-based nanoparticles with a diameter of less than 100 nm are a major part of diesel exhaust and ambient pollution (6Möller W. Brown D.M. Kreyling W.G. Stone V. Part Fibre Toxicol. 2005; 2: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Particulate ambient pollution is known to cause adverse health effects in susceptible individuals and aggravates existing respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (7Hussain S. Thomassen L.C. Ferecatu I. Borot M.C. Andreau K. Martens J.A. Fleury J. Baeza-Squiban A. Marano F. Boland S. Part. Fibre Toxicol. 2010; 7: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Even moderate levels of ambient air particulates are known to induce acute adverse health effects such as mortality in heart and lung diseases and chronic lung morbidity (8Lundborg M. Johard U. Låstbom L. Gerde P. Camner P. Environ Res. 2001; 86: 244-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Ultrafine particles are unique in their ability to bypass mucociliary clearance mechanisms and penetrate into deeper regions of the respiratory tract (9Lippmann M. Yeates D.B. Albert R.E. Br. J. Ind. Med. 1980; 37: 337-362PubMed Google Scholar, 10Oberdörster G. Ann. Occup. Hyg. 1994; 38 (421-402): 601-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Ferin J. Oberdörster G. Penney D.P. Am. J.

In a previous study, acute adverse effects of different types of carbonaceous nanoparticles instilled in mice strongly correlated with particle size and surface area (23Stoeger T. Reinhard C. Takenaka S. Schroeppel A. Karg E. Ritter B. Heyder J. Schulz H. Environ. Health Perspect. 2006; 114: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). A surface area threshold of ∼20 cm2 was defined for acute lung inflammation in mice below which no inflammatory responses were observed (23Stoeger T. Reinhard C. Takenaka S. Schroeppel A. Karg E. Ritter B. Heyder J. Schulz H. Environ. Health Perspect. 2006; 114: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). CB nanoparticles showed higher surface reactivity compared with a similar dose of larger particles (24Brown D.M. Dickson C. Duncan P. Al-Attili F. Stone V.

CB nanoparticles have also been shown to induce oxidative stress in alveolar macrophages, and it is believed that this capacity for oxidation may be mediated by particle surface functionality (19Koike E.

A recent study showed that the oxidative potency of CB nanoparticles correlates with their surface area and inflammatory responses (30Stoeger T. Takenaka S. Frankenberger B. Ritter B. Karg E. Maier K. Schulz H. Schmid O. Environ. Health Perspect. 2009; 117: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A possible mechanism for CB particle-related inflammation involves direct and indirect reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by particle-cell interactions, which in turn activates redox-sensitive transcription of proinflammatory genes (30Stoeger T. Takenaka S. Frankenberger B. Ritter B. Karg E. Maier K. Schulz H. Schmid O. Environ. Health Perspect. 2009; 117: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). ROS have been implicated as the cause of significant inflammation and, in some cases, cell death (31Martinon F. Mayor A. Tschopp J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 229-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar). One possible outcome of macrophage exposure to nanoparticles is cell death. Cell death may be categorized according to several characteristics including noninflammatory or proinflammatory and accidental or programmed. Apoptosis, perhaps the best characterized of these mechanisms, is a programmed and noninflammatory process. It is characterized by distinctive DNA cleavage as well as activation of the executioner caspases 3 and 9 (31Martinon F. Mayor A. Tschopp J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 229-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar, 32Fink S.L. Cookson B.T. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). In contrast to apoptosis, necrosis is defined as an accidental and proinflammatory form of cell death in which the plasma membrane loses its integrity, allowing rapid fluid influx, leading to cell swelling and lysis (32Fink S.L. Cookson B.T. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar, 33Kepp O. Galluzzi L. Zitvogel L. Kroemer G. Eur. J.

Pyroptosis is a recently described mechanism of cell death, sharing unique characteristics with both necrosis and apoptosis (32Fink S.L. Cookson B.T. Infect.

PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e111Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). It is defined by its dependence on inflammasome activation and caspase 1 activity. Inflammasomes, which can differ in their subunit composition, have been shown to activate caspase 1, which in the setting of a microbial stimulus activates the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 (33Kepp O. Galluzzi L. Zitvogel L. Kroemer G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2010; 40: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 34Bergsbaken T. Fink S.L. Cookson B.T. Nat. Rev.

Like apoptosis, pyroptosis is a form of programmed cell death. But unlike apoptosis, pyroptosis is characterized by loss of membrane integrity. This is due to caspase 1-dependent insertion of a pore into the membrane, leading to fluid influx, cell swelling, and lysis (38Fink S.L. Cookson B.T. Cell. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 1812-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Pyroptosis ultimately leads to release of cellular contents and inflammation (32Fink S.L. Cookson B.T. Infect.

The recent expansion of the nanotechnology industry as well as the continually growing sources of combustion derived pollution warrants investigation into the potential health effects of these nanoparticles. In this study we examined the effect of CB nanoparticles on the inflammasome and pyroptosis. The data show that macrophage exposure to 20 ± 6 nm CB nanoparticles induces caspase 1 activation and IL-1β release and the proinflammatory form of cell death, pyroptosis. TiO2 and CB nanoparticles were purchased from Degussa, GmbH (Düsseldorf, Germany). The manufacturer's stated average diameters of titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles (Degussa P25) and CB nanoparticles (Degussa Printex 90) are 21 and 14 nm, respectively. The nanoparticles were used as received from the manufacturer without modification. Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to identify crystalline phases of the sample. XRD was performed using a Bruker D-5000 q-q diffractometer with Kevex-sensitive detector (Madison, WI). High resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM; (JEOL JEM-2100F, Japan) operating at 200 kV was used to image the nanoparticles and measure their diameters to compare the average diameter to the manufacturer's specifications. Samples for TEM analysis were deposited from methanol suspensions onto copper grids. Dynamic light scattering (DLS, Beckman Coulter Delsa Nano C, Brea, CA) was used to measure hydrodynamic diameter of the nanoparticle aggregates in reduced serum media (Opti-MEM, Invitrogen), which was used as a cell culture medium in the cytotoxicity experiments. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy analysis was performed to check for metal impurities in CB nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were digested in concentrated nitric acid at 90 °C before the inductively coupled plasma analysis. The digested solutions were filtered and centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 rpm to remove nanoparticles and aggregates that were not dissolved. The final solutions were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (Varian 720 ES, Walnut Creek, CA). Surface area and surface composition of the TiO2 and CB nanoparticles were examined. Surface area measurements of powdered samples were performed on an automated multipoint Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area apparatus (Quantachrome Nova 4200e, Boynton Beach, FL) using nitrogen gas as the adsorbent. Samples were degassed at 100 °C for 24 h under vacuum before the analysis. The surface area of TiO2 and CB nanoparticles was calculated using the seven-point BET method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to probe the surface chemical composition characteristics of the powdered samples (Ultra-Axis DLD, Kratos, Manchester, UK). The system has been described before (40Baltrusaitis J. Usher C.R. Grassian V.H. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2007; 9: 3011-3024Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Samples were fixed overnight with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer. Post-fixation was carried out for 1 h at room temperature with a buffered 1% osmium tetroxide solution reduced with 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide. Samples were en bloc-stained using 2.5% uranyl acetate. Cells were then rinsed and dehydrated. Infiltration of Spurr's epoxy resin and acetone was carried out over several days to 100% resin and cured overnight in a 70 °C oven. Sections of 100-nm thickness were cut using a Leica EM UC6 ultramicrotome. Grids were then counterstained with 5% uranyl acetate for 12 min and Reynold's lead citrate for 5 min. Samples were imaged using a JEOL 1230 transmission electron microscope. RAW264.7 cells were obtained from ATCC (#TIB-71) and maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamycin, 40 μg/ml. Cells were subcultured every 2–3 days. Experiments were run in 6-well Costar tissue culture plates, 96-well assay plates, or coverslip chamber slides. To obtain normal human alveolar macrophages, subjects were recruited who were nonsmokers with no underlying medical conditions and on no medications other than possible birth control. After informed consent was obtained, subjects underwent standard flexible bronchoscopy. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed by instilling 20 ml of normal saline into a tertiary bronchus up to five times in three different lung segments. The first collection of five was discarded for possible contamination from upper airway secretions or by lidocaine, which is used to locally anesthetize the subject during the procedure. The remaining lavage was transported to the laboratory where fluid was filtered through sterile gauze and centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min to pellet cellular material. Cells were washed twice in PBS and finally re-suspended in RPMI plus Glutamax for cell culture. Cyto-prep slides were also made with the cells and stained with Wright stain. Slides were microscopically examined to ensure that greater than 95% of the cells were macrophages (41Monick M.M. Powers L.S. Barrett C.W. Hinde S. Ashare A. Groskreutz D.J. Nyunoya T. Coleman M.

All procedures and protocols described in this communication were approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained, and all clinical investigation was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Whole cell protein was obtained by lysing the cells on ice for 20 min in 200 μl of lysis buffer (0.05 m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, with added protease and phosphatase inhibitors: 1 protease minitab (Roche Biochemicals)/10 ml and 100 μl of 100× phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem)/10 ml. The lysates were sonicated for 20 s, kept at 4 °C for 30 min, and spun at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was saved. Protein determinations were made using the Bradford Protein assay from Bio-Rad. Cell lysates were stored at −70 °C until use. To isolate proteins from cell supernatants, macrophages were cultured in Opti-MEM® from Invitrogen to allow for reduced serum culture. Cell supernatant protein was obtained by concentrating the supernatants in Amicon p10 filter tubes, spun at 3000 × g for 30 min. Protein determinations were made using the Bradford Protein assay from Bio-Rad. Concentrated supernatants were stored at −70 °C until use. Western analysis for the presence of active caspase 1 was performed on whole cell proteins and concentrated supernatants from RAW cell experiments. 30 μg of protein was mixed 1:1 with 2− sample buffer (20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 1.25 m Tris, pH 6.8; all chemicals were from Sigma), heated to 95 °C for 5 min, loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and run at 100 V for 90 min. Cell proteins were transferred to PVDF (Bio-Rad) by semidry transfer (Bio-Rad). Equal loading of the protein groups on the blots was evaluated using Ponceau S, a staining solution designed for staining proteins on PVDF membranes or by stripping and reprobing with antibodies to β-actin or GAPDH. The PVDF was dried and then incubated with the primary antibody overnight in 5% milk. The blots were washed ×4 with TBS and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse IgG antibody. Immunoreactive bands were developed using a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences). An autoradiograph was obtained with exposure times of 10 s to 2 min. For these studies RAW cells were cultured in standard medium for 24 h with and without LPS (10 ng/ml). After the culture period, the supernatants were harvested and stored at −70 °C until assayed. The amount of IL-1β in the supernatant was measured by ELISA (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). For analysis of cell survival, macrophages were cultured in 96-well tissue culture plates. After incubations with nanoparticles, plasma membrane integrity was assayed by two methods (LDH release and PrestoBlue assay). Triplicate cultures were performed on all experiments. LDH released into the supernatant was monitored using CytoTox-ONETM Homogeneous Membrane Integrity Assay, which measures LDH release via a coupled fluorescent assay (Promega). PrestoBlue Cell Viability Assay was done following the manufacturer's protocol. For DNA analysis, cells were cultured in 100-mm tissue culture plates. After incubations with particles, whole cells were harvested in 500 μl of PBS, and DNA was isolated (DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). DNA concentration was measured, and equal concentrations were loaded and run on a SYBR Green gel (E-Gel 2% with SYBR Safe, Invitrogen). The gel was visualized with ultraviolet light, and samples were examined for laddering. Total RNA was isolated using the RNAqueous-4PCR kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA quality and quantity were assessed with Experion automated electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad) using the Experion RNA StdSens Analysis kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA quality was considered adequate for use if the 28 S/18 S ratio was >1.2 and the RNA Quality Indicator (RQI) was >7. Total RNA (300 ng) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR reactions were performed as previously described (44Hansdottir S. Monick M.M. Vitam. Horm. 2011; 86: 217-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Specificity of the amplification was confirmed using melting curve analysis. Data were collected and recorded by CFX Manager Software and expressed as a function of threshold cycle (CT). The relative quantity of the gene of interest was then normalized to relative quantity of HPRT (ΔΔCT). The sample mRNA abundance was calculated by the formula 2−(ΔΔCT). Specific primer sets used are as follows (5′ to 3′): IL-1β forward (5′-CTCCAGGGACAGGATATGGA-3′) and reverse (5′-TTCTGCTTGAGAG GTGCTGA-3′); IL-18 forward (5′-ACAGCTTCGGGAAGAGGAAAGGAA-3′) and reverse (5′-TGTCTTCTACTGGTTCAGCAGCCA-3′); TNFα forward (5′-AGGACACCATGAGCACTGAAAGCA-3′) and reverse (5′-TTGAGGGTTTGCTACAACATGGGC-3′). The results of particle characterization are summarized in Table 1. Primary particle diameters obtained from the TEM images (Fig. 1A) indicate that TiO2 nanoparticles have a diameter of 23 ± 3 nm, and CB nanoparticles have a diameter of 20 ± 6 nm (Table 1). For the CB nanoparticles, this result is close to the manufacturer's specified diameter of 14 nm. The aggregate size distributions of TiO2 and CB nanoparticles were measured using DLS in Opti-MEM media. Both types of nanoparticles form aggregates in the cell culture media. TiO2 nanoparticles have bimodal size distribution with peaks at 146 ± 60 and 985 ± 450 nm with a larger size distribution dominating over a smaller size distribution. CB nanoparticles have aggregate sizes of 175 ± 80 nm (Table 1). The XRD analysis of TiO2 nanoparticles indicates that there are anatase and rutile crystalline phases present in the sample (45Brough D. Rothwell N.J. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 772-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). A diffraction pattern for CB nanoparticles is similar to the literature reports for CB (46Perregaux D. Gabel C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15195-15203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and indicates crystalline phases of graphitic domains. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of TiO2 nanoparticles indicates 33, 61, and 6% of titanium, oxygen, and carbon, respectively, showing close to stoichiometric titanium:oxygen ratio and residual hydrocarbon and hydroxyl groups present on the surface of the sample (Fig. 1B). High resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of CB nanoparticles shows the presence of carbon at 285.0 eV with traces of oxygen at 530.0 eV (Fig. 1B). Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy analysis of CB nanoparticles digested in concentrated nitric acid revealed small amounts of metal impurities such as calcium (0.02%) and potassium (0.04%) present in the sample. The BET-specific surface areas of TiO2 and CB nanoparticles calculated using the 7-point BET method are 41 ± 1 and 279 ± 6 m2/g, respectively (Table 1). CB is considered to be a microporous material. The external surface area of CB nanoparticles calculated using the Halsey method (47) is 176 ± 9 m2/g.TABLE 1Summary of physicochemical characterization data of the nanoparticlesPhysiochemical characteristicsDetection methodTiO2Carbon blackPrimary particle sizeTEM23 ± 3 nm20 ± 6 nmPhaseXRDAnatase/rutileGraphitic domainsBET surface areaBET41 ± 1 m2/g279 ± 6 m2/gAggregate size in Opti-MEM mediaDLS146 ± 60 nm175 ± 80 nm985 ± 450 nm Open table in a new tab To evaluate the effect of nanoparticles on macrophage viability, RAW264.7 cells were seeded into 96-well tissue culture plates and cultured for 24 h with TiO2 (30 μg/cm2) or CB nanoparticles (30 μg/cm2). At the end of the culture period, one group was treated with ATP as a positive control for cell death (31Martinon F. Mayor A. Tschopp J. Annu. Rev.

https://openalex.org/W2161886493,"Osteomyelitis is a debilitating infectious disease of the bone. It is predominantly caused by S. aureus and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is characterised by weakened bones associated with progressive bone loss. Currently the mechanism through which either bone loss or bone destruction occurs in osteomyelitis patients is poorly understood. We describe here for the first time that the major virulence factor of S. aureus, protein A (SpA) binds directly to osteoblasts. This interaction prevents proliferation, induces apoptosis and inhibits mineralisation of cultured osteoblasts. Infected osteoblasts also increase the expression of RANKL, a key protein involved in initiating bone resorption. None of these effects was seen in a mutant of S. aureus lacking SpA. Complementing the SpA-defective mutant with a plasmid expressing spa or using purified protein A resulted in attachment to osteoblasts, inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis to a similar extent as wildtype S. aureus. These events demonstrate mechanisms through which loss of bone formation and bone weakening may occur in osteomyelitis patients. This new information may pave the way for the development of new and improved therapeutic agents to treat this disease."

https://openalex.org/W2016242824,"The tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus), vector of several emerging diseases, is expanding into more northerly latitudes as well as into higher altitudes in northern Italy. Changes in the pattern of distribution of the tiger mosquito may affect the potential spread of infectious diseases transmitted by this species in Europe. Therefore, predicting suitable areas of future establishment and spread is essential for planning early prevention and control strategies.To identify the areas currently most suitable for the occurrence of the tiger mosquito in the Province of Trento, we combined field entomological observations with analyses of satellite temperature data (MODIS Land Surface Temperature: LST) and human population data. We determine threshold conditions for the survival of overwintering eggs and for adult survival using both January mean temperatures and annual mean temperatures. We show that the 0°C LST threshold for January mean temperatures and the 11°C threshold for annual mean temperatures provide the best predictors for identifying the areas that could potentially support populations of this mosquito. In fact, human population density and distance to human settlements appear to be less important variables affecting mosquito distribution in this area. Finally, we evaluated the future establishment and spread of this species in relation to predicted climate warming by considering the A2 scenario for 2050 statistically downscaled at regional level in which winter and annual temperatures increase by 1.5 and 1°C, respectively.MODIS satellite LST data are useful for accurately predicting potential areas of tiger mosquito distribution and for revealing the range limits of this species in mountainous areas, predictions which could be extended to an European scale. We show that the observed trend of increasing temperatures due to climate change could facilitate further invasion of Ae. albopictus into new areas."

This study aims to test the hypothesis that elevated FGF21 concentrations are associated with the change of renal function and the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in the different stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression.240 subjects including 200 CKD patients (146 outpatients and 54 long-term hemodialytic patients) and 40 healthy control subjects were recruited. All CKD subjects underwent echocardiograms to assess left ventricular mass index. Plasma FGF21 levels and other clinical and biochemical parameters in all subjects were obtained based on standard clinical examination methods. Plasma FGF21 levels were significantly increased with the development of CKD from early- and end-stage (P<0.001 for trend), and significantly higher in CKD subjects than those in healthy subjects (P<0.001). Plasma FGF21 levels in CKD patients with LVH were higher than those in patients without LVH (P = 0.001). Furthermore, plasma FGF21 level correlated positively with creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), β2 microglobulin, systolic pressure, adiponectin, phosphate, proteinuria, CRP and triglyceride, but negatively with creatinine clearance rate (CCR), estimated glomerular filtrate rate (eGFR), HDL-c, LDL-c, albumin and LVH after adjusting for BMI, gender, age and the presence of diabetes mellitus. Multiple stepwise regression analyses indicated that FGF21 was independently associated with BUN, Phosphate, LVMI and β2 microglobulin (all P<0.05).Plasma FGF21 levels are significantly increased with the development of early- to end-stage CKD and are independently associated with renal function and adverse lipid profiles in Chinese population. Understanding whether increased FGF21 is associated with myocardial hypertrophy in CKD requires further study."
https://openalex.org/W2059527306,"The misfolding of the protein α-synuclein (αS) has been implicated in the molecular chain of events leading to Parkinson disease. Physiologically, αS undergoes a transition from a random coil to helical conformation upon encountering synaptic vesicle membranes. On analogous small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), the conformation of αS is dominated by a single elongated αS helix. However, alternative broken helix states have been postulated, mandating experimental clarification. Here, the upper limit for the free energy difference between elongated and broken helix conformations on SUVs resembling synaptic vesicles was determined to be 1.2 ± 0.4 kcal/mol, which amounts to a population ratio of 7.6:1 between both states (12% broken helices). In response to helix breaks at different positions, αS rearranged in an opportunistic manner, thereby minimizing helix abrogations to as little as one to two turns. Enthalpy and entropy measurements of gel state SUV-αS interactions indicated that broken helix states retain the ability to relieve membrane-packing stress. Thus, broken helix states are a distinct physiological feature of the vesicle-bound αS state, making it a ""checkered"" protein of multiple parallel conformations. A continuous interconversion between structural states may contribute to pathological αS misfolding."

Previous studies suggest that TWEAK activates cell death indirectly, by inducing TNFα-mediated autocrine signals. However, the underlying death-signaling mechanism has not been directly defined. Consistent with earlier work, TWEAK assembled a proximal signaling complex containing its cognate receptor FN14, the adaptor TRAF2, and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1).

Knockdown of RIP1 by siRNA prevented TWEAK-induced association of FADD with caspase-8 but not formation of the FN14-TRAF2-cIAP1 complex and inhibited apoptosis activation. Depletion of the RIP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase cIAP1 enhanced assembly of the RIP1-FADD-caspase-8 complex and augmented cell death.

Similarly to TWEAK, FN14 is expressed on a variety of cell types. FN14 is the smallest member of the TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamily. The mature cell surface human FN14 polypeptide is 102 amino acids long, consisting of a single extracellular cysteine-rich domain, a transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail that contains a TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) binding motif but lacks a canonical death domain.

The cell-extrinsic pathway is activated upon binding of proapoptotic ligands such as Fas/CD95L (TNFSF6) or Apo2L/TRAIL (TNFSF10) to their cognate death domain-containing receptors on the surface of target cells. This leads to receptor clustering and recruitment FADD and caspase-8 to form the death-inducing signaling complex. FADD binds to death receptors such as Fas/CD95 (TNFRSF6) or DR4 (TNFRSF10A) and DR5 (TNFRSF10B) via death-domain interactions and recruits caspase-8 to the death-inducing signaling complex through death effector domain interactions. In turn, caspase-8 is activated and autocatalytically processed, an event that is augmented by Cullin-3-mediated caspase-8 ubiquitination and aggregation (27Jin Z. Li Y. Pitti R. Lawrence D. Pham V.C. Lill J.R. Ashkenazi A. Cell. 2009; 137: 721-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Caspase-8 then activates downstream executioners caspase-3 and caspase-7, triggering the apoptotic demise of the cell. Binding of TNFα (TNFSF2) to TNFR1 (TNFRSF1A) leads to association of a signaling complex in which the TNFR1 death domain recruits the adaptor protein TNFR-associated protein with death domain, TRADD (28Chen G.

TRADD subsequently assembles a signaling complex (complex I) at the plasma membrane, which includes RIP1, TRAF2 or 5, and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins cIAP1 and 2. This complex can activate downstream pathways, including the NF-κB, JNK, and p38 MAPK cascades. Following internalization of TNFR1, posttranslational modifications and conformational changes in RIP1 and TRAF2 lead to their dissociation from TRADD and in turn to association of two additional cytoplasmic complexes (complexes IIA and IIB). TRADD can recruit FADD and caspase-8 (complex IIA) to initiate apoptosis. Dissociated RIP1 also can interact with FADD and caspase-8 (complex IIB), further activating apoptosis. The intrinsic apoptosis pathway is initiated when BH3-only proteins are activated transcriptionally or posttranslationally in response to intracellular stresses (e.g. DNA damage). BH3 proteins neutralize antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins and/or activate the proapoptotic family members BAX and BAK to induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Cytochrome C is then released, promoting apoptosome formation with the adaptor Apaf-1 and the initiator protease caspase-9. The apoptosome drives activation of caspase-9 and, consequently, of the executioner proteases caspase-3 and caspase-7. An additional proapoptotic protein released from mitochondria is SMAC/DIABLO, which competes with inhibitor of apoptosis proteins such as XIAP for binding to caspases, reversing their caspase-inhibitory activity. In various cell types, commonly referred to as type II cells, apoptosis commitment in response to cell-extrinsic stimuli requires cross-talk between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways (25Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 38Wilson N.S. Dixit V. Ashkenazi A. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). This cross-talk occurs through caspase-8-mediated processing of the BH3-only protein BID. Truncated BID then engages BAX and BAK to induce MOMP and release cytochrome C and SMAC, further augmenting caspase activation. The ability of TWEAK to induce apoptosis in certain cells as a single agent or in combination with other cytokines such as IFNγ is intriguing, given the absence of a death domain in FN14. Previous work has revealed that in Kym1 rhabdomyosarcoma cells, the cytotoxic activity of TWEAK is exerted indirectly via induction of TNFα and consequent autocrine action (40Schneider P. Schwenzer R. Haas E. Mühlenbeck F. Schubert G. Scheurich P. Tschopp J. Wajant H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). More recent studies suggest that a similar mechanism underlies TWEAK-induced cell death in SKOV3 and OVCAR4 ovarian carcinoma cells (41Vince J.E. Chau D. Callus B. Wong W.W. Hawkins C.J. Schneider P.

While biochemical evidence exists for the assembly of a proximal TWEAK signaling complex consisting of FN14, TRAF2, and cIAP1 (41Vince J.E. Chau D. Callus B. Wong W.W. Hawkins C.J. Schneider P. McKinlay M. Benetatos C.A. Condon S.M. Chunduru S.K. Yeoh G. Brink R. Vaux D.L. Silke J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 171-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), the specific intracellular signaling complexes and pathways that trigger apoptosis activation in response to TWEAK have not been directly identified. In this study, we demonstrate that TWEAK stimulates apoptosis via a TNFα-TNFR1-dependent complex containing RIP1, the adaptor FADD, and the apoptosis-initiating protease caspase-8. Furthermore, we show that TWEAK relies on both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways to trigger cell death. These results provide direct molecular insight into the key intracellular biochemical events that mediate apoptosis activation by TWEAK.

Cells were removed using cell dissociation buffer (C1419, Sigma Aldrich). Experiments with RIP1 or TNFR1 used a pool of two siRNAs: RIP1 (A and B) and TNFR1 (B and C). MOMP was analyzed according to the manufacturer's protocol. A total of 10,000 events were captured using FACS. HSC3 cells were seeded overnight in 10-cm dishes and treated with TWEAK (3 μg/ml) for specific amounts of time. When applicable 20 μm zVAD-FMK was added 1 h prior to TWEAK treatment. Cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed at 4 °C in 20 mm TRIS-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.57 mm PMSF, and 1× complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet (11873580001, Roche). Cells lysates (2 mg of protein) were incubated with specific IP antibodies as listed above overnight at 4 °C. The following day, 30 μl of bead volume of protein A/G-agarose (Thermo Scientific, catalog no. 20421) was added for 2 h at room temperature, and the beads were washed four times with lysis buffer. Novex Tris-glycine SDS sample buffer (1×) (Invitrogen) was added, and the beads were boiled for 5 min at 95 °C. Lysates for siRNA experiments, caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, caspase-7, TRAF2, and cIAP1 time-course experiments were generated using 1× radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (20–188, Millipore, Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

RT-PCR was performed using the cDNA RT kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Transcript levels of TNFα were measured (HS00174128_m1, Applied Biosystems), and the comparative CT method was used to determine the fold change in expression. To define the molecular events that mediate cell death induction by TWEAK, we purposely selected cell lines that were previously shown to be sensitive to TWEAK in the absence of any added sensitizing agents such as IFNγ or cycloheximide, namely, human oral squamous carcinoma HSC3 and human endometrial carcinoma HEC1A cells (42Nakayama M. Kayagaki N. Yamaguchi N. Okumura K. Yagita H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1373-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 43Nakayama M. Ishidoh K. Kayagaki N. Kojima Y. Yamaguchi N. Nakano H.

Cancer Lett. 2010; 294: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Treatment of HSC3 and HEC1A cells with TWEAK induced a substantial loss of cell viability in a dose-dependent fashion, with half-maximal activity at 10–100 ng/ml (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). HSC3 cell death was accompanied by activation of the initiator caspase-8 and executioners caspase-3 and caspase-7, and caspase activation could be blocked by the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-FMK (Fig. 1, B and C), consistent with induction of apoptosis. Kinetic analysis showed that TWEAK caused a significant loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity by 6–12 h (Fig. 1D), further confirming the apoptotic nature of the effect of TWEAK. Kinetic analysis of cell death indicated substantial loss of cell viability by 6–12 h after TWEAK addition (Fig. 1E), in keeping with the time frame of MOMP induction. To interrogate the activation of caspases in response to TWEAK, we examined processing events by IB analysis with caspase-specific antibodies. Caspase-8 is the key initiator protease in the cell-extrinsic pathway (24Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5154) Google Scholar, 45Boatright K.M. Salvesen G.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). TWEAK augmented processing of caspase-8 and generation of its active p18 fragment by 2–3 h (Fig. 1F). Caspase-8 processing was associated with depletion of the caspase-8 substrate BID, which was detectable by 3 h (supplemental Fig. S2), confirming caspase-8 activation. Caspase-9 is the key initiator protease in the cell-intrinsic apoptosis pathway (24Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5154) Google Scholar, 45Boatright K.M. Salvesen G.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). TWEAK stimulated detectable processing of caspase-9, indicated by generation of the active p37 fragment by 3–4 h (Fig. 1G) (46Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1799) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TWEAK induced processing of the effectors caspase-3 and caspase-7 by 5 h, evident by appearance of the respective p19/17 and p18 fragments of these enzymes (Fig. 1H). These results suggested that TWEAK engages key initiator caspases of both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, leading to downstream activation of executioner caspases. Recent work has suggested that TRAF2 and cIAP1 may play a role in regulating apoptosis stimulation by TNFα, SMAC mimetics, and perhaps TWEAK (39Wang L. Du F. Wang X. Cell. 2008; 133: 693-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 47Silke J. Brink R.

In many cases, they show higher receptor affinity, enhanced biological activity, and improved serum stability. Technical difficulties in producing cyclic peptides, especially larger ones, in appreciable yields have precluded a prolific use in biomedical research. Here, we describe a novel and efficient cyclization method that uses the peptidyl-transferase activity of the Staphylococcus aureus enzyme sortase A to cyclize linear synthetic precursor peptides. As a model, we used histatin 1, a 38-mer salivary peptide with motogenic activity. Chemical cyclization of histatin 1 resulted in ≤3% yields, whereas sortase-mediated cyclization provided a yield of >90%. The sortase-cyclized peptide displayed a maximum wound closure activity at 10 nM, whereas the linear peptide displayed maximal activity at 10 μM. Circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopic analysis of the linear and cyclic peptide in solution showed no evidence for conformational changes, suggesting that structural differences due to cyclization only became manifest when these peptides were located in the binding domain of the receptor. The sortase-based cyclization technology provides a general method for easy and efficient manufacturing of large cyclic peptides.—Bolscher, J. G. M., Oudhoff, M. J., Nazmi, K., Antos, J.

https://openalex.org/W2007285124,"Acquired chemoresistance not only blunts anticancer therapy but may also promote cancer cell migration and metastasis. Our previous studies have revealed that acquired tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) resistance in lung cancer cells is associated with Akt-mediated stabilization of cellular caspase 8 and Fas-associated death domain (FADD)-like apoptosis regulator-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1). In this report, we show that cells with acquired TRAIL resistance have significantly increased capacities in migration and invasion. By gene expression screening, tissue transglutaminase (TGM2) was identified as one of the genes with the highest expression increase in TRAIL-resistant cells. Suppressing TGM2 dramatically alleviated TRAIL resistance and cell migration, suggesting that TGM2 contributes to these two phenotypes in TRAIL-resistant cells. TGM2-mediated TRAIL resistance is likely through c-FLIP because TGM2 suppression significantly reduced c-FLIP but not Mcl-1 expression. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) was suppressed when TGM2 was inhibited, suggesting that TGM2 potentiates cell migration through up-regulating MMP-9 expression. We found that EGF receptor (EGFR) was highly active in the TRAIL-resistant cells, and suppression of EGFR dramatically reduced TGM2 expression. We further determined JNK and ERK, but not Akt and NF-κB, are responsible for EGFR-mediated TGM2 expression. These results identify a novel pathway that involves EGFR, MAPK (JNK and ERK), and TGM2 for acquired TRAIL resistance and cell migration in lung cancer cells. Because TGM2 couples TRAIL resistance and cell migration, it could be a molecular target for circumventing acquired chemoresistance and metastasis in lung cancer.

Anticancer chemotherapy is one of the main approaches for treating patients with late stage lung cancer. Commonly used anticancer drugs kill cancer cells mainly through induction of apoptosis. However, cancer cells readily escape this cytotoxic mechanism of therapeutics. Many cancer cells are primarily resistant to apoptosis, which is usually due to down-regulation of the apoptosis pathways and/or activation of cell survival signals through genetic and epigenetic aberrations acquired during transformation (1Fulda S.

In addition, cancer cells acquire apoptosis resistance during chemotherapy (secondary or acquired apoptosis resistance) (3Wilson T.R. Johnston P.G. Longley D.B. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2009; 9: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 4Song J.J. An J.Y. Kwon Y.T. Lee Y.J. J. Biol.

Herr I. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1740-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Acquired apoptosis resistance has been an increasing concern because it has emerged as an important mechanism underlying acquired chemoresistance (6Ghavami S. Hashemi M. Ande S.R. Yeganeh B. Xiao W.

Oncol. 2010; 4: 284-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Indeed, acquired apoptosis resistance is detrimental because it not only dampens the anticancer activity of the drugs but also promotes cancer progression and metastasis (8Roché H. Vahdat L.T. Ann. Oncol. 2011; 22: 1000-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For example, when acquired resistance to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis arises, instead of killing the cancer cells, TRAIL 3The abbreviations used are: TRAILTNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligandEGFREGF receptorMMP-9matrix metalloproteinase 9TRTRAIL-resistantCOX-2cyclooxygenase 2Mcl-1myeloid cell leukemia 1TGM2tissue transglutaminaseDRdeath receptorNCnegative control. promotes proliferation and metastasis in the apoptosis-resistant cancer cells, converting TRAIL from a cancer killer to a cancer promoter during therapy (9Malhi H.

Therefore, it is crucial to understand the mechanism of acquired apoptosis resistance and its associated cancer cell metastasis to retain the cancer-killing activity while circumventing the cancer promoting potential of chemotherapeutics such as TRAIL.

Due to its selective cytotoxicity in transformed cells, TRAIL is regarded as the most promising anticancer agent in the TNF superfamily of cytokines (11Abdulghani J. El-Deiry W.S. Expert. Opin. Ther. Targets. 2010; 14: 1091-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). TRAIL as well as TRAIL receptor agonist antibodies are currently tested as anticancer agents in clinical trials for treating solid tumors, including lung cancer (12Stegehuis J.H. de Wilt L.H. de Vries E.G.

TRAIL kills cancer cells mainly through activating the extrinsic apoptosis pathway via ligation to its functional receptors, death receptor 4 (DR4)/TRAIL-R1 and DR5/TRAIL-R2 (11Abdulghani J. El-Deiry W.S. Expert. Opin. Ther. Targets. 2010; 14: 1091-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). TRAIL-induced apoptosis is executed through recruitment of caspase-8 to the death-inducing signal complex and subsequent activation of downstream effectors caspase-3 and -7 (14Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The apoptotic signal can be amplified through caspase-8-mediated cleavages of the BH3-only Bcl-2 family member BID that activates the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway (14Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, there are mechanisms that keep the TRAIL-induced apoptosis pathway in check, which are adapted by cancer cells to escape from the cytotoxicity of TRAIL. For example, the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) by DR4 or DR5 signaling prevents the initiation of apoptosis (15Lin Y. Devin A. Cook A. Keane M.M. Kelliher M. Lipkowitz S. Liu Z.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6638-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 16Wajant H. Vitam. Horm. 2004; 67: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Decoy receptor 1 (DcR1)/TRAIL-R3 and DcR2/TRAIL-R4 and osteoprotegerin compete with the functional receptors to blunt TRAIL-induced apoptosis (17Wajant H. Gerspach J. Pfizenmaier K. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 55-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for acquired TRAIL resistance has not been well elucidated (4Song J.J. An J.Y. Kwon Y.T. Lee Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 319-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 5Wenger T. Mattern J. Penzel R. Gassler N. Haas T.L. Sprick M.R. Walczak H. Krammer P.H.

Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have recently established acquired TRAIL resistance in lung cancer cell lines by continuously exposing the TRAIL-sensitive lung cancer cells to nontoxic doses and gradually increasing the concentrations of TRAIL (19Wang X. Chen W. Zeng W. Bai L. Tesfaigzi Y. Belinsky S.A. Lin Y. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Chen W. Bai L. Wang X. Xu S. Belinsky S.A. Lin Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 77: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). With these cells, we have demonstrated that the acquired TRAIL resistance was associated with Akt-mediated stabilization of c-FLIP and Mcl-1 and overexpression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) (19Wang X. Chen W. Zeng W. Bai L. Tesfaigzi Y. Belinsky S.A. Lin Y. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Chen W. Bai L. Wang X. Xu S. Belinsky S.A. Lin Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 77: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although apoptosis resistance-associated metastasis has been widely observed, the underlying mechanisms for which, particularly for TRAIL resistance-associated cancer cell migration and invasion, are poorly studied (10Ishimura N. Isomoto H. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver. Physiol. 2006; 290: G129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 21Fingas C.D. Blechacz B.R. Smoot R.L. Guicciardi M.E. Mott J. Bronk S.F. Werneburg N.W. Sirica A.E. Gores G.J. Hepatology. 2010; 52: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although cancer metastasis consists of multiple steps involving invading the extracellular matrix and migrating from the primary site to distal sites, migration and invasion represent the important early processes of this malignant behavior of cancer (22Grivennikov S.I. Greten F.R. Karin M. Cell. 2010; 140: 883-899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7639) Google Scholar, 23Lin Y. Shi R. Wang X. Shen H.M. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2008; 8: 634-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Understanding how acquired TRAIL resistance-associated cancer cell migration and invasion holds a key for prevention of this acquired detrimental effect of TRAIL in cancer therapy. In this report, we determined that the lung cancer cells with acquired TRAIL resistance have significantly increased migration and invasion capacities. By gene expression screening, tissue transglutaminase (tTG, also called TGM2) was identified as one of the genes with the highest expression increase in TRAIL-resistant cells. Further experiments demonstrate that TGM2 plays an important role in both TRAIL resistance and cell migration. The results reveal a novel pathway consisting of EGFR, MAPK (JNK and ERK), and TGM2 that promotes TRAIL resistance through c-FLIP and migration/invasion through MMP-9, and suggest TGM2 as a molecular target for circumventing acquired chemoresistance and metastasis because this protein couples TRAIL resistance and cell migration in lung cancer. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-TRAIL was prepared as described previously (15Lin Y. Devin A. Cook A. Keane M.M. Kelliher M. Lipkowitz S. Liu Z.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6638-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 24Chen W. Wang X. Zhuang J. Zhang L. Lin Y. Carcinogenesis. 2007; 28: 2114-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Cystamine was from Sigma-Aldrich. EGFR inhibitor III (a selective and irreversible inhibitor that blocks EGFR autophosphorylation), U0126, SP600125, SB203580, IKK inhibitor II, and LY294002 were purchased from Calbiochem. Small interfering RNA (siRNA; SiGenome SMARTpool) for TGM2, MMP-9, EGFR, and negative control siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon. The TGM2 siRNAs targeting the 3′-UTR of the TGM2 mRNA were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. The targeted sequences are as follows: TGM2 siRNA-2, 5′-CTCCTCTCTCTAAGCCTCAGTCTCC-3′; TGM2 siRNA-4, 5′-GGACAGAAGGTGGTCACAGTCATGG-3′. Matrigel was from BD Biosciences. The following antibodies were used for Western blot: anti-TGM2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-β-tubulin and β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich); anti-MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 (Calbiochem); anti-c-FLIP and Mcl-1 (Alexis Laboratories); anti-phospho-EGFR (Y1086, Abcam), anti-EGFR, anti-ERK, anti-Akt, and anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) (Cell Signaling Technology); anti-phospho-ERK and phospho-JNK (BIOSOURCE); and anti-JNK1 (BD Biosciences). The TGM2-expressing vector pCDNA-TGM2 was provided generously by Dr. Gail V. W. Johnson from the University of Rochester (25Tucholski J. Johnson G.V. J. Biol.

The human lung cancer cell lines A549, H460, and H1568 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. A549-TRAIL-resistant (TR), H460-TR, and H1568-TR cells were established as described previously (19Wang X. Chen W. Zeng W. Bai L. Tesfaigzi Y. Belinsky S.A. Lin Y. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Chen W. Bai L. Wang X. Xu S. Belinsky S.A. Lin Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 77: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and were maintained in the same growth medium supplemented with TRAIL. The parental wild-type cell lines were designated as A549-WT, H460-WT, and H1568-WT, respectively. For ectopic expression of TGM2, A549-WT and -TR cells were transfected with pCDNA-TGM2, stable transfectant clones were selected and maintained in medium containing G418 (200 μg/ml). A549- or H1568-TR cells were seeded in a six-well plate the day before transfection at 30–50% confluency. siRNA was transfected with INTERFERinTM siRNA transfection reagent (Polyplus-transfection). Forty-eight hours after transfection, TGM2, MMP-9, and EGFR protein levels were measured by Western blot. A549- or H1568-WT TR cells, cystamine-treated or -untreated TR cells, and NC or TGM2 or MMP-9 siRNA-transfected TR cells were grown to 90% confluency in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS, and then they were incubated with medium containing 2% FBS overnight. The cultured cells were scratched using a 200-μl pipette tip and rinsed with PBS twice to remove free floating cells and debris. After being incubated with medium containing 10% FBS, the cells were visualized by light microscopy at 0 and 16 h after scratch. The experiments were repeated three times. To assess cell migration in vitro, A549 or H1568-WT TR cells, cystamine-treated or -untreated TR cells, and NC or TGM2 or MMP-9 siRNA-transfected TR cells (2 × 104 in 100 μl serum-free medium) were placed in the top chamber of transwell migration chambers (pore size, 5 μm; Corning Co.). The lower chamber was filled with 600 μl of medium with 2% FBS. After 6 h, cells that had not migrated to the lower chamber were wiped away from the upper surface of the transwell membrane with a cotton swab. Migrated cells on the lower membrane surface were fixed, stained, photographed, and counted. The experiment was repeated at least three times. The migration index was calculated by taking the migrated cell number of the control as 1. In vitro invasion assays were done in Matrigel-coated transwells. A549 or H1568-WT TR cells, cystamine-treated or -untreated TR cells, and NC or TGM2 or MMP-9 siRNA-transfected TR cells (5 × 104 in 200 μl serum-free medium) were put in the top chamber, whereas the lower chamber was filled with 600 μl of medium with 10% FBS as chemoattractant. After 24 h, cells that had not invaded to the lower chamber were wiped away from the upper surface of the transwell membrane with a cotton swab. Invaded cells on the lower membrane surface were fixed, stained, photographed, and counted. The invasion index was calculated by taking the invaded cell number of the control sample as 1. Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Two microgram of RNA from each sample was used as a template for cDNA synthesis with a reverse transcription kit (Promega). An equal volume of cDNA product was used in the PCR. The primers were used as follows: TGM2, 5′-TCCTCTCTGGGCCTTTGTTTCCTT-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-TATGGCTTAAGGCTTCGTGGAGCA-3′ (reverse primer); β-actin, 5′-CCAGCCTTCCTTCCTGGGCAT-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-AGGAGCAATGATCTTGATCTTCATT-3′ (reverse primer). The reaction condition was as follows: 95 °C for 2 min, 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s and after indicated cycles, 72 °C for 6 min. For TGM2, the PCR cycles were 30, whereas for β-actin, the cycles were 22. PCR products were resolved in 2% agarose gels with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide, visualized, and photographed. Total cell protein was extracted in M2 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Equal amounts of cell proteins were resolved in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to PVDF membranes. The proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare). The intensity of the individual bands was quantified by densitometry (NIH ImageJ, version 1.62) and normalized to the corresponding input control (β-actin or β-tubulin) bands. Fold changes were calculated with the control taken as 1. Cytotoxicity was determined using a lactate dehydrogenase release-base cytotoxicity detection kit (Promega). Cells were seeded in 48-well plates at 70 to 80% confluency, cultured overnight, and then treated as indicated in the figure legends. Lactate dehydrogenase release was determined, and cell death was calculated as described previously (19Wang X. Chen W. Zeng W. Bai L. Tesfaigzi Y. Belinsky S.A. Lin Y. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 26Ju W. Wang X. Shi H. Chen W. Belinsky S.A. Lin Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 1381-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The experiments were repeated three times, and representative results are shown in the figures. Data were expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was examined by one-way analysis of variance. In all analyses, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Cancer cells with chemoresistance may have increased migration and metastasis potential (8Roché H. Vahdat L.T. Ann. Oncol. 2011; 22: 1000-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Malhi H. Gores G.J. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7333-7335Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have established lung cancer cells with acquired TRAIL resistance by treating the cells with chronic exposure to increasing concentrations of TRAIL and have determined a pathway involving the cell survival kinase Akt, caspase inhibitor c-FLIP, the prosurvival Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 and COX-2 that contribute to the cell's resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (19Wang X. Chen W. Zeng W. Bai L. Tesfaigzi Y. Belinsky S.A. Lin Y. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Chen W. Bai L. Wang X. Xu S. Belinsky S.A. Lin Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 77: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the cells with acquired TRAIL resistance (TR) have increased migration potential, a migration transwell assay was performed. Compared with A549-WT, A549-TR cells exhibited a 3.0-fold increase of cells migrating through the membrane (Fig. 1A, left). To substantiate this observation, a wound healing migration assay was employed, which consistently showed that A549-TR cells had higher migration potential than A549-WT cells (Fig. 1B). Similarly, compared with their respective WT cells, H460-TR and H1568-TR cells showed a 1.9- and 3.3-fold increases in migration, respectively (Fig. 1A, right). Because tumor cell invasiveness relies heavily on cell migration (27Sahai E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), we further examined whether the TR cells have elevated invasion potential with an in vitro Matrigel invasion transwell assay. Significantly more A549-TR (12.7-fold) than A549-WT cells (1-fold) invaded the Matrigel (Fig. 1C, left). Notably, there was no difference in cell proliferation between A549-WT and A549-TR cells (data not shown), suggesting that the increased cell migration and invasion ability in A549-TR cells was unlikely due to change of cell proliferation rates. Similarly, H1568-TR and H460-TR cells had 3.0- and 4.1-fold higher invasion compared with their respective WT cells, respectively (Fig. 1C, right). These results suggest that the lung cancer cells with acquired TRAIL resistance have elevated capacities in migration and invasion. To explore the molecular basis of increased cell migration and invasion in the TRAIL-resistant cells, a gene expression microarray assay was employed for comparing the H460-TR to H460-WT cells. TGM2 was identified to be one of the genes that had the most significant expression increase (19-fold) in H460-TR cells (data not shown). To validate the result, RT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect TGM2 mRNA and TGM2 protein expression, respectively. In agreement with the gene expression microarray results, TGM2 mRNA and protein levels were remarkably higher in A549-, H460-, and H1568-TR cells than their respective WT cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Because TGM2 was reportedly involved in regulation of apoptosis and cell migration (28Mehta K. Kumar A. Kim H.I. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2010; 80: 1921-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we focused on this multifunctional factor in this study. We then investigated the involvement of TGM2 in the migration and invasion of the TR cell. The TGM2 inhibitor cystamine was first used to suppress TGM2 activity. Cystamine markedly suppressed A549-TR cell migration, which was detected with both the wound healing and transwell migration assays (Fig. 3, A and B). A similar inhibitory effect of cystamine on migration in H1568-TR and H460 cells was also detected (Fig. 3B). To substantiate this result, TGM2 siRNA was used to deplete TGM2 from the TR cells (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S1). Consistently, knockdown of TGM2 expression effectively blocked A549-TR cell migration (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S1). A similar inhibitory effect of TGM2 expression suppression on A549-TR, H460, and H1568-TR cell invasion was observed (Fig. 3D). Notably, the inhibitory effect of TGM2 suppression with either cystamine or siRNA on cell migration and invasion was much stronger in A549-TR than in H1568-TR cells (Fig. 3, B and D), which was well correlated with the extent of TGM2 expression increase (Fig. 2). Furthermore, ectopic overexpression of TGM2 in A549-WT cells significantly increased cell migration and invasion (supplemental Fig. S2). More importantly, the migration suppression by TGM2 knockdown was effectively alleviated when TGM2 expression in A549-TR cells was restored by ectopic expression with a TGM2-expressing vector that escaped the TGM2 siRNA targeting (supplemental Fig. S3). These results strongly suggest that TGM2 plays an important role in the increased migration and invasion in the TR cells. One of the early steps in cancer cell metastasis is to penetrate the extracellular matrix, a process involving matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Previous reports suggested that MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 are involved in human lung cancer cell metastasis (29Ohbayashi H. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2002; 3: 409-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We then explored which MMP is regulated by TGM2 in TR cells. When TGM2 expression was knocked down, the expression of MMP-9 but not MMP-1 and -2 was substantially suppressed (Fig. 4A). Indeed, MMP-9 protein expression was markedly higher in A549-TR and H1568-TR cells compared with their respective WT cells (Fig. 4B). Knockdown of MMP-9 expression in A549-TR cells dramatically inhibited migration and invasion (Fig. 4, C and D, and supplemental Fig. S4). These results suggest that TGM2 regulates TR cell migration and invasion at least partly through MMP-9. To investigate the role and mechanism by which TGM2 contributes to TRAIL resistance, the effects of suppressing TGM2 activity with cystamine or TGM2 expression with siRNA on TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity were examined. Cystamine substantially sensitized A549-TR, H460-TR, and H1568-TR cells to TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 5, A and B). Likewise, TGM2 siRNA significantly potentiated TRAIL-induced death in A549-TR cells (Fig. 5C and supplemental Fig. S5). Similar effects were seen in H1568-TR cells (data not shown). More importantly, the sensitization of the cytotoxicity of TRAIL by TGM2 knockdown in A549-TR cells was effectively attenuated when TGM2 expression was restored by ectopic expression with a TGM2-expressing vector that has escaped the TGM2 siRNA targeting (supplemental Fig. S6). Furthermore, artificially overexpressing TGM2 in A549-WT cells significantly suppressed TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity (supplemental Fig. S7). These results imply that TGM2 overexpression plays a substantial role in acquired TRAIL resistance. Our previous studies found that Akt-mediated overexpression of c-FLIPL, Mcl-1L, and COX-2 plays an important role in acquired TRAIL resistance (19Wang X. Chen W. Zeng W. Bai L. Tesfaigzi Y. Belinsky S.A. Lin Y. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Chen W. Bai L. Wang X. Xu S. Belinsky S.A. Lin Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 77: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether TGM2 regulates c-FLIPL, Mcl-1L or COX-2 expression in TR cells. Cystamine treatment substantially reduced the expression levels of c-FLIPL but not Mcl-1L and COX-2 in both A549-TR and H1568-TR cells (Fig. 6, A and B). Consistently, knockdown of TGM2 expression in A549-TR cells resulted in a similar reduction of c-FLIPL but not Mcl-1L or COX-2 expression (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that c-FLIPL is one of the downstream effectors of TGM2 in mediating acquired TRAIL resistance. Although the expression and activity of Akt were barely affected by TGM2 siRNA (Fig. 6C), it appears that TGM2 regulates c-FLIPL expression through a novel pathway, which is Akt-independent.FIGURE 6TGM2 suppression reduced expression of c-FLIP-1L but not Mcl-1L and COX-2. A and B, the indicated cells were treated with cystamine (CTM; 1 mm) overnight or were left untreated. c-FLIP-1L, Mcl-1L, and COX-2 were detected by Western blot. β-Tubulin was detected as an input control. C, A549-TR cells were transfected with TGM 2 siRNA (pool) or NC siRNA. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cell lysates were prepared, and the indicated proteins were detected by Western blot. β-Tubulin was detected as an input control. Fold changes were calculated with the control taken as 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) EGFR-mediated cell signaling is involved in cancer development and drug resistance in a variety of human tumors (30Ho C.

Cell Signal. 2007; 19: 2013-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Because EGFR signaling was reported to up-regulate TGM2 expression (32Li B. Antonyak M.A. Druso J.E. Cheng L. Nikitin A.Y. Cerione R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 1408-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 33Antonyak M.A. Li B. Regan A.D. Feng Q. Dusaban S.S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17914-17925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we examined the expression and activity of EGFR in the TR cells. Indeed, the active form (phosphorylated) of EGFR was markedly elevated, whereas the total EGFR protein was slightly increased, in A549-TR and H1568-TR cells (Fig. 7A, top). Blocking EGFR activity with the EGFR inhibitor greatly reduced TGM2 mRNA and protein expression (Fig. 7A). To further validate the role of EGFR in regulating TGM2 protein expression, RNA interference was employed to knock down EGFR expression in A549-TR cells. TGM2 protein level was down-regulated when EGFR expression and activity were suppressed with EGFR siRNA (Fig. 7A, bottom). These results clearly suggest that the activation of EGFR is responsible for increased TGM2 expression in the TR cells. We further delineated the signaling pathway that mediates the EGFR-dependent activation of TGM2. In TR cells, the main signaling pathways activated by EGFR, Akt, JNK, and ERK were activated in A549-TR and H1568-TR cells (Fig. 7B). Suppressing EGFR dramatically reduced the activity of these pathways, suggesting the increased EGFR activity is the main upstream event of these pathways in the TR cells (Fig. 7B). To examine the role of these pathways in TGM2 expression, inhibitors for each pathway, PI3K/Akt (LY294002), MEK/ERK (U0126), and JNK (SP600125) were used to treat the cells. The inhibitors for MEK/ERK and JNK but not Akt significantly suppressed TGM2 expression in A549-TR cells. As controls, the p38 inhibitor SB203580 and NF-κB inhibitor IKKin exerted no inhibitory effect on TGM2 expression. All the inhibitors were effective in suppressing their respective pathways (supplemental Fig. S8). A moderate stimulatory effect of the p38 and NF-κB inhibitors was noted. The roles and mechanisms for the negative effect on TGM2 expression of these two pathways deserve further investigation. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the two MAPKs, JNK and ERK, are the major downstream kinases for EGFR-mediated TGM2 expression. Conversely, suppression of TGM2 had no effect on ERK and JNK activity (Fig. 7D), further placing TGM2 downstream of JNK and ERK. Collectively, these results establish a novel pathway that involves EGFR, MAPK (ERK and JNK), and TGM2 for acquired TRAIL resistance and cell migration in lung cancer cells, and TGM2 is important for mediating both TRAIL resistance and cell migration through c-FLIP and MMP-9, respectively (Fig. 8). In this study, we determined that a novel pathway consisting of EGFR, MAPK (JNK and ERK), and TGM2 is responsible for acquired TRAIL resistance-associated migration and invasion in lung cancer cells. Specifically, the expression of TGM2 was up-regulated by EGFR-mediated MAP kinases JNK and ERK, and TGM2 plays a dual role in both TRAIL resistance and cell migration through up-regulation of c-FLIP and MMP-9, respectively. Suppression of TGM2 was able to simultaneously alleviate TRAIL resistance and suppress cell migration and invasion. Therefore, TGM2 could be a molecular target for circumventing acquired TRAIL resistance-associated metastasis. Our previous studies have established a pathway consisting of Akt, c-FLIP, Mcl-1, and COX-2 that is responsible for acquired TRAIL resistance in lung cancer cells (19Wang X. Chen W. Zeng W. Bai L. Tesfaigzi Y. Belinsky S.A. Lin Y. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Akt-mediated COX-2 activation triggers Mcl-1 but not c-FLIP expression (20Chen W. Bai L. Wang X. Xu S. Belinsky S.A. Lin Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 77: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this report, we identify a new branch of cell signaling that up-regulates c-FLIP expression through TGM2. The observation is consistent with recent reports showing that TGM2 conveys cancer cell resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (34Frese-Schaper M. Schardt J.A. Sakai T. Carboni G.L. Schmid R.A. Frese S. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 2867-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 35Jang J.H. Park J.S. Lee T.J. Kwon T.K. Cancer Lett. 2010; 287: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this new pathway is driven by EGFR-mediated MAPKs (JNK and ERK) but not Akt. The results add more complexity to acquired TRAIL resistance and suggest that overexpression of c-FLIP in the TRAIL-resistant cells is achieved in at least two distinct pathways: that through Akt and MAPK/TGM2, respectively (Ref. 19Wang X. Chen W. Zeng W. Bai L. Tesfaigzi Y. Belinsky S.A. Lin Y. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar and this study). Blockage of both pathways may be required to sufficiently reduce c-FLIP expression to prevent or alleviate acquired TRAIL resistance in lung cancer. It was reported that TGM2 suppresses DR5 expression (34Frese-Schaper M. Schardt J.A. Sakai T. Carboni G.L. Schmid R.A. Frese S. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 2867-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, we did not detect changes in DR5 expression in our TRAIL-resistant cells (data not shown). As one of the major obstacles that hinder cancer therapy, acquired chemoresistance not only neutralizes anticancer activity of the drugs but also promotes tumor progression (8Roché H. Vahdat L.T. Ann. Oncol. 2011; 22: 1000-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although chemoresistance-associated migration/invasion has been observed, the underlying mechanism of which has not been well studied. By gene expression screening, we identified TGM2 as one protein factor coupling TRAIL resistance and migration/invasion. Consistent with previous reports (34Frese-Schaper M. Schardt J.A. Sakai T. Carboni G.L. Schmid R.A. Frese S. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 2867-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 35Jang J.H. Park J.S. Lee T.J. Kwon T.K. Cancer Lett. 2010; 287: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), suppressing TGM2 activity with cystamine or expression with siRNA dramatically alleviated TRAIL resistance and cell migration. Interestingly, TGM2 suppression greatly reduced expression of MMP-9, a matrix metalloproteinase that is involved in cancer cell migration/invasion. Suppression of MMP-9 expression with siRNA substantially inhibited cell migration/invasion, suggesting that MMP-9 is one of the major MMPs that contribute to acquired TRAIL resistance-associated migration/invasion. Although regulated by TGM2 in certain cancer cell types, other MMPs such as MMP-2 are unlikely involved in migration in the lung cancer cells with acquired TRAIL resistance (36Satpathy M. Shao M. Emerson R. Donner D.B. Matei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 15390-15399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the mechanisms of TGM2 in cancer cell migration/invasion are cell type-specific or that the functioning mechanism of TGM2 in acquired TRAIL resistance-associated migration/invasion is distinct to that in cancer cells with primary apoptosis resistance. Indeed, it was reported that in primary TRAIL-resistant cholangiocarcinoma cells, NF-κB pathway was utilized for TRAIL-triggered cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis (10Ishimura N. Isomoto H. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver. Physiol. 2006; 290: G129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 21Fingas C.D. Blechacz B.R. Smoot R.L. Guicciardi M.E. Mott J. Bronk S.F. Werneburg N.W. Sirica A.E. Gores G.J. Hepatology. 2010; 52: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, NF-κB is apparently not involved in the TGM2-mediated MMP9 expression and migration/invasion in our TRAIL-resistant cells. Although it remains to be determined how TGM2 promotes MMP9 expression in the context of acquired TRAIL resistance in lung cancer cells, our results establish a novel signaling cascade containing TGM2 and MMP-9 for acquired TRAIL resistance-associated migration/invasion. Targeting the key factors such as TGM2 in this pathway may prevent or attenuate invasion or metastasis during chemotherapy with TRAIL. As the most diverse and ubiquitous member of the transglutaminase family of enzymes that catalyze posttranslational modification of proteins, TGM2 has been found to play roles in a variety of diseases, including cancer (37Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). It has been shown that TGM2 promotes cell growth, survival, and motility or invasion (38Verma A. Wang H. Manavathi B. Fok J.Y. Mann A.P. Kumar R. Mehta K. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 10525-10533Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 39Park K.S. Kim H.K. Lee J.H. Choi Y.B. Park S.Y. Yang S.H. Kim S.Y. Hong K.M. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2010; 136: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although increased TGM2 expression in cancer cells has been linked to increased drug resistance, metastasis, and poor patient survival (36Satpathy M. Shao M. Emerson R. Donner D.B. Matei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 15390-15399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 37Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Oncol. 2010; 17: 967-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), to our knowledge, this is the first report showing that TGM2 is overexpressed when acquired TRAIL resistance arises with the association of increased cell migration and invasion. Although the regulation of TGM2 expression is complex, EGFR-mediated cell signaling is implicated in up-regulation of TGM2 expression in cancer cells (32Li B. Antonyak M.A. Druso J.E. Cheng L. Nikitin A.Y. Cerione R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 1408-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, we reveal that EGFR-mediated activation of JNK and ERK increases TGM2 expression, which contributes to acquired TRAIL resistance and cell migration. Because EGFR is the main determinant of Akt activity that plays an important role in apoptosis resistance in the cells with acquired TRAIL resistance (19Wang X. Chen W. Zeng W. Bai L. Tesfaigzi Y. Belinsky S.A. Lin Y. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Chen W. Bai L. Wang X. Xu S. Belinsky S.A. Lin Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 77: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), findings in this study place EGFR at the upstream of the two signaling cascades that involve Akt and TGM2, respectively (Fig. 8). Future studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanism by which EGFR is activated when lung cancer cells are chronically exposed to TRAIL. Nevertheless, our results for the first time demonstrate that EGFR activation is required for establishing cancer cell resistance to TRAIL and subsequently enhanced cancer cell migration and invasion. Collectively, results from this study establish a new signaling pathway consisting of EGFR, ERK or JNK, and TGM2 for acquired TRAIL resistance and cell migration in lung cancer cells. Because TGM2 couples acquired TRAIL resistance and cell migration, it could be a molecular target for circumventing acquired chemoresistance and metastasis in lung cancer. We thank Dr. Gail V.W.

https://openalex.org/W2047741179,"Background Micronuclei (MN) in mammalian cells serve as a reliable biomarker of genomic instability and genotoxic exposure. Elevation of MN is commonly observed in cells bearing intrinsic genomic instability and in normal cells exposed to genotoxic agents. DNA double-strand breaks are marked by phosphorylation of H2AX at serine 139 (γ-H2AX). One subclass of MN contains massive and uniform γ-H2AX signals. This study tested whether this subclass of MN can be induced by replication stress. Principal Findings We observed that a large proportion of MN, from 20% to nearly 50%, showed uniform staining by antibodies against γ-H2AX, a marker of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Such micronuclei were designated as MN-γ–H2AX (+). We showed that such MN can be induced by chemicals that are known to cause DNA replication stress and S phase arrest. Hydroxyurea, aphidicolin and thymidine could all significantly induce MN-γ–H2AX (+), which were formed during S phase and appeared to be derived from aggregation of DSBs. MN-γ–H2AX (−), MN that were devoid of uniform γ-H2AX signals, were induced to a lesser extent in terms of fold change. Paclitaxel, which inhibits the disassembly of microtubules, only induced MN-γ–H2AX (−). The frequency of MN-γ–H2AX (+), but not that of MN-γ–H2AX (−), was also significantly increased in cells that experience S phase prolongation due to depletion of cell cycle regulator CUL4B. Depletion of replication protein A1 (RPA1) by RNA interference resulted in an elevation of both MN-γ–H2AX (+) and MN-γ–H2AX (−). Conclusions/Significance A subclass of MN, MN-γ–H2AX (+), can be preferentially induced by replication stress. Classification of MN according to their γ-H2AX status may provide a more refined evaluation of intrinsic genomic instabilities and the various environmental genotoxicants."
https://openalex.org/W2153346092,"Previous studies suggest that exogenous factors crucial for spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) self-renewal are conserved among several mammalian species. Since glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) are critical for rodent SSC self-renewal, we hypothesized that they might promote self-renewal of nonrodent SSCs. Therefore, we cultured testicular germ cells from prepubertal rabbits in the presence of GDNF and FGF2 and found they proliferated indefinitely as cellular clumps that displayed characteristics previously identified for rodent SSCs. The rabbit germ cells could not be maintained on mouse embryonic fibroblast (STO) feeders that support rodent SSC self-renewal in vitro but were rather supported on mouse yolk sac-derived endothelial cell (C166) feeder layers. Proliferation of rabbit germ cells was dependent on GDNF. Of critical importance was that clump-forming rabbit germ cells colonized seminiferous tubules of immunodeficient mice, proliferated for at least 6 mo, while retaining an SSC phenotype in the testes of recipient mice, indicating that they were rabbit SSCs. This study demonstrates that GDNF is a mitogenic factor promoting self-renewal that is conserved between rodent and rabbit SSCs; with an evolutionary separation of ~60 million years. These findings provide a foundation to study the mechanisms governing SSC self-renewal in nonrodent species.—Kubota, H., Wu, X., Goodyear, S. M., Avarbock, M. R., Brinster, R. L.

https://openalex.org/W2038369742,"The potential for emergence and spread of HIV drug resistance from rollout of antiretroviral (ARV) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an important public health concern. We investigated determinants of HIV drug resistance prevalence after PrEP implementation through mathematical modeling.A model incorporating heterogeneity in age, gender, sexual activity, HIV infection status, stage of disease, PrEP coverage/discontinuation, and HIV drug susceptibility, was designed to simulate the impact of PrEP on HIV prevention and drug resistance in a sub-Saharan epidemic.Analyses suggest that the prevalence of HIV drug resistance is influenced most by the extent and duration of inadvertent PrEP use in individuals already infected with HIV. Other key factors affecting drug resistance prevalence include the persistence time of transmitted resistance and the duration of inadvertent PrEP use in individuals who become infected on PrEP. From uncertainty analysis, the median overall prevalence of drug resistance at 10 years was predicted to be 9.2% (interquartile range 6.9%-12.2%). An optimistic scenario of 75% PrEP efficacy, 60% coverage of the susceptible population, and 5% inadvertent PrEP use predicts a rise in HIV drug resistance prevalence to only 2.5% after 10 years. By contrast, in a pessimistic scenario of 25% PrEP efficacy, 15% population coverage, and 25% inadvertent PrEP use, resistance prevalence increased to over 40%.Inadvertent PrEP use in previously-infected individuals is the major determinant of HIV drug resistance prevalence arising from PrEP. Both the rate and duration of inadvertent PrEP use are key factors. PrEP rollout programs should include routine monitoring of HIV infection status to limit the spread of drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2084698999,"The mitotic checkpoint maintains genomic stability by ensuring that chromosomes are accurately segregated during mitosis. When the checkpoint is activated, the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), assembled from BUBR1, BUB3, CDC20, and MAD2, directly binds and inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) until all chromosomes are properly attached and aligned. The mechanisms underlying MCC assembly and MCC-APC/C interaction are not well characterized. Here, we show that a novel interaction between BUBR1 and closed MAD2 (C-MAD2) is essential for MCC-mediated inhibition of APC/C.

The mitotic checkpoint (or spindle assembly checkpoint) prevents premature sister chromatid segregation by delaying the metaphase-to-anaphase transition in response to defective microtubule attachment at kinetochores. This failsafe mechanism is specified by a group of evolutionarily conserved proteins that includes MAD1, MAD2, BUBR1(MAD3), BUB1, BUB3, and MPS1 (1Musacchio A. Salmon E.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar). The target of the mitotic checkpoint is anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), 3The abbreviations used are: APC/Canaphase-promoting complex/cyclosomeCclosedMCCmitotic checkpoint complexOopen. the multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes anaphase onset through ubiquitylating securin and cyclin B for degradation (2Peters J.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). In APC/CCDC20, CDC20 is the activator subunit in the APC/C holoenzyme that also plays major roles in substrate recruitment (3Kimata Y. Baxter J.E. Fry A.M. Yamano H. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 576-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome closed mitotic checkpoint complex open. Kinetochores lacking proper microtubule attachment or tension emit a diffusible “wait anaphase” signal that has been shown to depend primarily on MAD2 (1Musacchio A. Salmon E.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar). MAD2 can assume two topologically distinct states called open (O) or closed (C) conformers (4Luo X. Yu H. Structure. 2008; 16: 1616-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Mapelli M. Musacchio A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 716-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The two conformers exhibit distinct structures at the N and C termini, particularly in the arrangement and position of two C-terminal β-strands and connecting loops. A closed “safety belt”-like loop is present only in C-MAD2 where either MAD1 or CDC20 can bind to form “liganded” C-MAD2. Although the predominant conformer in cells is O-MAD2, during mitosis the MAD1·C-MAD2 complex localized at unattached kinetochores catalytically converts the cytosolic pool of O-MAD2 into C-MAD2 (4Luo X. Yu H. Structure. 2008; 16: 1616-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Mapelli M. Musacchio A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 716-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). C-MAD2 released from kinetochores can form CDC20·C-MAD2 complexes that may further amplify the production of C-MAD2 by converting additional molecules of O-MAD2 (6Simonetta M. Manzoni R. Mosca R. Mapelli M. Massimiliano L. Vink M. Novak B. Musacchio A. Ciliberto A. PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e10Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A MAD2 dimerization domain, mainly involving residues at its αC helix (122–142 residues in human MAD2), is fundamental in mediating O→C-MAD2 conversion. Purified O-MAD2 spontaneously converts into C-MAD2 at a very slow rate (4Luo X. Yu H. Structure. 2008; 16: 1616-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Mapelli M. Musacchio A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 716-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar); therefore recombinant MAD2 contains a mixture of O-MAD2 monomer, O:C heterodimer, and C:C homodimer (7Yang M. Li B. Liu C.J. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Rizo J. Yu H. Luo X. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e50Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Acceleration of the O→C conversion has been achieved in vitro with purified liganded C-MAD2, in the form of MAD1·C-MAD2 or CDC20·C-MAD2 complexes. The conversion depends on transient O:C heterodimerization that requires Arg133 and Gln134 residues (4Luo X. Yu H. Structure. 2008; 16: 1616-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Mapelli M. Musacchio A. Curr. Opin. Struct.

PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e50Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Liganded C-MAD2 seems incapable of forming C:C homodimers due to steric clashes at the MAD2 dimerization interface (7Yang M. Li B. Liu C.J. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Rizo J. Yu H. Luo X. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e50Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Interestingly, p31comet, a negative regulator of the mitotic checkpoint, was shown to exploit the dimerization interface to block O→C-MAD2 conversion during mitosis (8Xia G. Luo X. Habu T. Rizo J. Matsumoto T. Yu H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3133-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 9Mapelli M. Filipp F.V. Rancati G. Massimiliano L. Nezi L. Stier G. Hagan R.S. Confalonieri S. Piatti S. Sattler M. Musacchio A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1273-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Through structural mimicry, p31comet binds to C-MAD2 at the αC helix thus preventing access of O-MAD2 for heterodimerization (10Yang M. Li B. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Rizo J. Yu H. Luo X. Cell. 2007; 131: 744-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The MCC, composed of BUBR1, BUB3, MAD2, and CDC20, was isolated biochemically from HeLa cells as a factor that can bind and potently inhibit mitotic APC/C (>3000-fold higher activity over recombinant MAD2) (11Sudakin V. Chan G.K. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 925-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The MCC is evolutionarily conserved as homologous complexes have also been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Xenopus laevis, and mouse (12Hardwick K.G. Johnston R.C.

The current model on MCC composition proposes that MAD2 and the cell cycle-independent BUBR1·BUB3 subcomplex do not interact directly, but are brought together with CDC20 as a bridging subunit (18Davenport J. Harris L.D. Goorha R. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 1831-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Once bound to APC/C, MCC efficiently prevents APC/C from binding and ubiquitylating substrates (19Herzog F. Primorac I. Dube P. Lenart P. Sander B. Mechtler K. Stark H. Peters J.M. Science. 2009; 323: 1477-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The inhibition of APC/C is thought to arise mainly from the two KEN boxes at the N terminus of BUBR1. Although the KEN box is a well characterized degron in many APC/C substrates, BUBR1 may utilize KEN boxes to inhibit APC/C acting as a pseudosubstrate (17Malureanu L.A. Jeganathan K.B. Hamada M.

Early in vitro studies showed that high concentrations of both MAD2 and BUBR1 can inhibit the APC/C by binding to and sequestering CDC20 from the APC/C core subunits, and the formation of CDC20·C-MAD2 complex is still accepted as the terminal step of the mitotic checkpoint signal transduction (22Tang Z. Bharadwaj R. Li B. Yu H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 227-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 23Luo X. Fang G. Coldiron M. Lin Y. Yu H. Kirschner M.W. Wagner G. Nat.

It is unclear how MAD2 and BUBR1 coordinate in the MCC to impart the potent APC/C inhibition activity for the whole complex. Human full-length BUBR1, MAD2, and CDC20 cDNAs were amplified from a prostate cDNA library (Invitrogen) or freshly prepared reverse transcribed cDNAs provided by Dr. Douglas Leaman (University of Toledo). Full-length cDNAs and fragments were usually cloned into pENTR-D/TOPO first and then subcloned into various destination vectors using the Gateway recombination reactions (Invitrogen). Point mutations were generated using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The features of different protein fragments or mutants are described in supplemental Table S1. HeLaM, a subline of HeLa, was maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. To block cells in prometaphase, HeLaM cells were treated with 2.5 mm thymidine for 24 h and then directly released into medium containing 60 ng/ml nocodazole for 12 h. DNA transfection was performed using polyethylenimine (25Durocher Y. Perret S. Kamen A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: E9Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) at a DNA:polyethylenimine ratio of 1:3 or FuGENE 6 (Roche). The following antibodies were used at the indicated dilutions: CDC20 (sc-13162, 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), MAD2 (A300-301A-2, 1:1000; Bethyl), cyclin B1 (sc-245, 1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), securin (ab3305, 1:100; Abcam), GST (26H1, 1:1000; Cell Signaling), GFP (A11122, 1:500; Invitrogen), HA (sc-805, 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Other antibodies included BUBR1 (mouse monoclonal, 1:1000), BUBR1 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000), MAD2 (mouse monoclonal, 1:500), MAD1 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:2000), BUB3 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000), CDC27 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000), ATM (rabbit polyclonal, 1:200), CDC16 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000) and APC7 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000) that have been described previously (26Chan G.K. Jablonski S.A. Sudakin V. Hittle J.C. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 941-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 27Liu S.T. Rattner J.B. Jablonski S.A. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (A3688) and goat anti-rabbit (A3812) secondary antibodies were purchased from Sigma and used at 1:30,000. Cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (1 × PBS, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Protease Inhibitor Mixture set III, EDTA-free; Calbiochem) and phosphatase inhibitors (100 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 nm Microcystin LR). The protein concentration of the lysates was measured using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). Immunoblotting was used to probe specific proteins in the cell lysates, immunoprecipitates, or in vitro binding assays. In some experiments the blots were scanned, and the intensities of bands of interest were quantified using Kodak Molecular Imaging software. For immunoprecipitation, 200–300 μg of lysates were incubated with appropriate antibodies (0.5–1 μg) at 4 °C for 1 h and then mixed with protein A-agarose beads (RepliGen) for another 1 h. Immune complexes were washed four times with cell lysis buffer containing 250 mm NaCl and then subjected to SDS-PAGE separation. For GST pulldown experiments, cell lysates were added directly to glutathione-agarose (Pierce) and incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The extracts were prepared following Braunstein et al. (28Braunstein I. Miniowitz S. Moshe Y. Hershko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4870-4875Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Nocodazole-arrested HeLaM cells were harvested by pipetting, washed with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in 75% of pellet volume of hypotonic buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.6, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT) containing protease inhibitors. After repeated freeze-thawing, the cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatants were collected, supplemented with glycerol to 10% (v/v), aliquoted, and stored in liquid nitrogen. The protein concentration of the extracts was 15–20 mg/ml. To assay for APC/C activity, 20-μl reaction mixtures contained 10 μl of concentrated mitotic extract, 2 μl of 10× degradation mixture (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 10 mg/ml ubiquitin, 100 mm phosphocreatine, 5 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml UbcH10), and 1 μl of 20× creatine phosphokinase (1 mg/ml). Recombinant proteins were added in some experiments. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C, and 3-μl samples were withdrawn at various times, and then rapidly quenched with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Degradation of cyclin B and securin was followed by immunoblotting. Untransfected or 6×HA-MAD2L13A- or 6×HA-MAD2LARQ-transfected mitotic cell lysates were separated on a Superose 6 column (10/300 GL; GE Healthcare). The column was equilibrated and eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 250 mm NaCl and 1 mm DTT. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected, concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. GST-tagged BUBR1(1–371) and CDC20(111–138), His6-tagged UbcH10, and wild-type and mutant MAD2 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3) RIPL (Stratagene) at 37 °C or 25 °C. His6-tagged CDC20 and GST-tagged full-length BUBR1 were expressed in Sf9 cells following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Proteins were purified using glutathione-agarose (Pierce) or Probond nickel beads (Invitrogen). The His tag was removed from MAD2 by tobacco etch virus protease cleavage. Concentrations of recombinant proteins were determined by comparing the target band with BSA standards on Coomassie Blue-stained gels. This was carried out based on Simonetta et al. (6Simonetta M. Manzoni R. Mosca R. Mapelli M. Massimiliano L. Vink M. Novak B. Musacchio A. Ciliberto A. PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e10Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and illustrated in supplemental Fig. S3. 5 μl of GSH-agarose beads were coated with 25 μl of GST-CDC20(111–138) (0.4 mg/ml) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed four times with cell lysis buffer containing 250 mm NaCl. The GST-CDC20(111–138)-coated or mock-treated beads (5 μl) were then incubated with 20 μl of untagged MAD2WT (∼0.1 mg/ml) for 24 h at 25 °C. During the incubation, the preexistent C-MAD2 in MAD2WT is expected to be captured by GST-CDC20(111–138) and then acts as a catalyst to convert more O-MAD2 into C-MAD2. Recombinant proteins were incubated at 37 °C in 20-μl reactions in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 100 μg/ml BSA) for 1 h. The reactions were then mixed with 5 μl of glutathione-agarose and gently rocked at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were washed four times with cell lysis buffer containing 250 mm NaCl before SDS-PAGE. Yeast two-hybrid was carried out as described (29Serebriiskii I. Khazak V. Golemis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17080-17087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Coding sequences of two testing proteins were fused with either LexA DNA binding domain or B42 activation domain and used as bait and prey, respectively. The bait and prey DNA constructs were transformed into the yeast strain SKY48. Approximately 1 × 105 confirmed transformants were plated on a galactose-containing leucine dropout reporter plate. Colony growth, indicating positive protein-protein interactions, was followed for 4 days. It is widely assumed C-MAD2 amplified by unattached kinetochores constitutes a major “wait anaphase” signal that targets CDC20 to inhibit APC/C activity. To understand the effector formation step of the mitotic checkpoint mechanistically, we used a chromosome-free mitotic extract that partially recapitulates mitotic checkpoint inhibition of the APC/C (11Sudakin V. Chan G.K. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 925-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 28Braunstein I. Miniowitz S. Moshe Y. Hershko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4870-4875Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The extract retained sufficient checkpoint activity to inhibit APC/C for about 15 min before endogenous cyclin B1 and securin were abruptly degraded (Fig. 1A, control). To bypass the signal amplification step that normally requires O→C-MAD2 conversion, the MAD2L13A mutant, which is known to be locked in the C-conformation (10Yang M. Li B. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Rizo J. Yu H. Luo X. Cell. 2007; 131: 744-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 30Mapelli M. Massimiliano L. Santaguida S. Musacchio A. Cell. 2007; 131: 730-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), was purified and added directly into the extract (see supplemental Table S1 for features of protein fragments/mutants used in this study). The addition of MAD2L13A, at 2- and 20-fold excess over endogenous MAD2, extended APC/C inhibition by ∼15 and 30 min, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). Importantly, the extended APC/C inhibition correlated with prolonged MCC-APC/C association, as indicated by higher levels of BUBR1 and MAD2 in the CDC27 (an APC/C subunit) immunoprecipitates from 20× MAD2L13A supplemented extract, particularly at 30 min (Fig. 1, C and D). In the presence of 20× MAD2L13A, cyclin B1, and securin, degradation was observed after 60 min (Fig. 1, A and B), coinciding with >50% of BUBR1 dissociating from the APC/C (Fig. 1, C and D). Because the MAD2 level in the CDC27 immunoprecipitates was still high at 60 min, the result suggested that simultaneous binding of both BUBR1 and MAD2 is necessary for efficient APC/C inhibition. Delay of APC/C activation was also observed in extracts prepared from GST-MAD2L13A-transfected mitotic cells compared with control extracts (Fig. 1E). The delay in activation was specific to C-MAD2 because addition of excess O-MAD2 (MAD2ΔC10) did not alter APC/C activation kinetics whereas wild-type (MAD2WT), a mixture of O- and C-MAD2, displayed a modest effect (Fig. 1F). Due to the importance of O:C-MAD2 heterodimerization in the production and amplification of C-MAD2 wait anaphase signals, a dimerization-defective MAD2 (e.g. R133E/Q134A) is unable to support the mitotic checkpoint (31De Antoni A. Pearson C.G. Cimini D. Canman J.C. Sala V. Nezi L. Mapelli M. Sironi L. Faretta M. Salmon E.D. Musacchio A. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 214-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). However, if MAD2 dimerization is only required for O→C-MAD2 conversion, addition of a dimerization-defective C-MAD2 (L13A/R133E/Q134A, MAD2LARQ) to the chromosome-free mitotic extract should delay APC/C activation as effectively as MAD2L13A. Surprisingly, addition of up to 100-fold molar excess of MAD2LARQ did not delay APC/C activation (Fig. 2A). Similar observations were made when another C-MAD2 mutant (L13Q, MAD2LQ) (30Mapelli M. Massimiliano L. Santaguida S. Musacchio A. Cell. 2007; 131: 730-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and its dimerization-defective counterpart (L13Q/R133E/Q134A, MAD2LQRQ) were tested in the extracts (supplemental Fig. S1A). The dimerization defect of MAD2LARQ was confirmed in the immunoprecipitation experiments shown in Fig. 2B as it failed to bind endogenous MAD2. Interestingly, the ability of MAD2LARQ to bind CDC20 was not compromised in vivo (Fig. 2B) or in vitro (see Fig. 4A; see also supplemental Fig. S1B for MAD2LQRQ). Nevertheless, MAD2LARQ co-immunoprecipitated only half the levels of BUBR1, BUB3, and CDC27 compared with MAD2L13A (Fig. 2B). Consistently, fractionation of mitotic lysates using size-exclusion chromatography demonstrated that MAD2L13A expression in HeLa cells more effectively promoted MCC-APC/C interaction than MAD2LARQ, as evidenced by higher relative enrichment of CDC27, BUBR1, CDC20, HA-tagged and endogenous MAD2 in the fractions corresponding to the MCC·APC/C supracomplex (8∼9 ml eluates, Fig. 2, C and D). Together, these results indicate that Arg133 and Gln134 residues in the αC helix of C-MAD2 are critical for MCC formation and APC/C inhibition in addition to their involvement in O→C-MAD2 conversion.FIGURE 4The R133E/Q134A mutant reduces C-MAD2 binding to BUBR1 but not CDC20. A, purified recombinant proteins were incubated at intracellular concentrations of endogenous proteins (Fig. 3 legend) for 1 h. GST pulldowns and inputs were probed with the indicated antibodies. Both GST-BUBR1(1–371) and GST-CDC20(111–138) were detected with anti-GST antibody. B, comparison of the full-length BUBR1 binding to MAD2L13A and MAD2LARQ is shown. C, human BUBR1 structure and two models of MCC architecture are illustrated schematically. The two CDC20 binding domains of BUBR1 are shown as CDC20 BD1 and CDC20 BD2. One or both KEN boxes in the N-terminal region of BUBR1 (1–371 residues) are required for CDC20 binding. The GLEBS motif is required for BUBR1-BUB3 interaction. The αC helix of C-MAD2 is represented by a zigzag line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To delineate further the role of C-MAD2 in MCC assembly, interactions between MCC subunits were examined using purified recombinant proteins at levels comparable with estimated intracellular concentrations (24Fang G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). We initially focused on BUBR1(1–371) in these experiments as this segment of BUBR1 has been suggested to be responsible for most, if not all, of BUBR1 checkpoint activity (17Malureanu L.A. Jeganathan K.B. Hamada M. Wasilewski L. Davenport J. van Deursen J.M. Dev. Cell. 2009; 16: 118-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 18Davenport J. Harris L.D. Goorha R. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 1831-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). GST-BUBR1(1–371) pulled down His6-CDC20 (Fig. 3A, lane 2), indicating direct interaction between BUBR1 and CDC20 as reported before (22Tang Z. Bharadwaj R. Li B. Yu H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 227-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, GST-BUBR1(1–371) also formed binary interactions with MAD2WT and MAD2L13A, even though they have long been postulated to interact indirectly through mutual associations with CDC20 (18Davenport J. Harris L.D. Goorha R. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 1831-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Fang G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 7). Approximately 10-fold more MAD2L13A bound to BUBR1(1–371) than MAD2WT. When incubated together, CDC20 and MAD2 both associated with BUBR1(1–371) (Fig. 3A, lanes 4–6 and 8–10). When recombinant full-length BUBR1 was examined, it was able to bind ∼10-fold higher amounts of MAD2L13A compared with BUBR1(1–371) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with the in vitro binding assays, GST-BUBR1(1–371) and endogenous BUBR1 both interacted with C-MAD2 but not O-MAD2 in transfected cells (supplemental Fig. S2). We performed three additional experiments to verify direct BUBR1-MAD2 interaction. A MAD2W75A mutant was reported to adopt C-conformation preferentially but is incapable of binding CDC20 due to direct involvement of Trp75 in the CDC20-C-MAD2 interaction (7Yang M. Li B. Liu C.J. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Rizo J. Yu H. Luo X. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e50Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). When expressed in mitotic HeLa cells, the GST-tagged MAD2W75A mutant bound to endogenous MAD1, suggesting adoption of C-conformation (Fig. 3C). MAD2W75A also indeed failed to interact with endogenous CDC20; however, the mutant associated with co-transfected GFP-BUBR1(1–371) (Fig. 3C). This in vivo result supports the concept that MAD2 can interact with BUBR1 independently of CDC20. Further confirmation of the interaction was conducted using yeast two-hybrid assays (Fig. 3D). When grown on leucine dropout reporter plates, colonies appeared for the following [bait + prey] combinations: [MAD2WT + BUBR1(1–371)]; [MAD2L13A + BUBR1(1–371)]; [BUBR1(1–371) + MAD2L13A] as well as the positive control [MAD1 + MAD2L13A] (Fig. 3D, arrowheads), whereas vector controls and [MAD2ΔC10 + BUBR1(1–371)] yielded no colonies. To exclude the possibility that residue substitutions in MAD2L13A and MAD2W75A, rather than the conformation of the mutants, enhanced the BUBR1-MAD2 interaction, C-MAD2 was generated in an in vitro O→C conversion experiment by preincubating recombinant MAD2WT with immobilized GST-CDC20(111–138) for 24 h (6Simonetta M. Manzoni R. Mosca R. Mapelli M. Massimiliano L. Vink M. Novak B. Musacchio A. Ciliberto A. PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e10Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3E; see also supplemental Fig. S3 for explanation of experimental design). Following removal of the GST-CDC20(111–138) beads, the resulting MAD2-containing supernatant was examined for GST-BUBR1(1–371) binding. GST-BUBR1(1–371) clearly pulled down more MAD2 that had preincubated with CDC20(111–138) (Fig. 3E, lane 3; compare with lane 2, beads alone), supporting selective binding to C-MAD2. To understand further the functional defects of MAD2LARQ, in vitro binding assays were used to assess the interactions between recombinant MAD2L13A, MAD2LARQ and GST-BUBR1(1–371) or GST-CDC20(111–138) following clues from immunoprecipitation results (Fig. 2B). Similar levels of MAD2L13A and MAD2LARQ bound to CDC20(111–138) following incubation, indicating that both C-MAD2 molecules display similar association with the CDC20 peptide (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 6; supplemental Fig. S1B, lanes 5 and 6). The conclusion was also supported with MAD2L13Q and MAD2LQRQ mutants (supplemental Fig. S1B, lanes 9 and 10). In contrast, ∼5 times more MAD2L13A bound to BUBR1(1–371) than MAD2LARQ after 1 h of incubation (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4; supplemental Fig. S1B, lanes 3 and 4). Differential bindings to BUBR1 by C-MAD2 with or without additional R133E/Q134A mutations were also observed with full-length BUBR1 (Fig. 4B) and with MAD2LQ and MAD2LQRQ mutants (supplemental Fig. S1B, lanes 7 and 8). In this study, we presented evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between BUBR1 and C-MAD2 and showed that the interaction plays critical roles in MCC-mediated inhibition of APC/C. The results are consistent with the notion that the integrity of MCC is essential for its highly potent APC/C inhibitory activity compared with BUBR1 or MAD2 alone (11Sudakin V. Chan G.K. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 925-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 19Herzog F. Primorac I. Dube P. Lenart P. Sander B. Mechtler K. Stark H. Peters J.M.

As C-MAD2 is believed to be part of the wait anaphase signal that is generated from unattached kinetochores (1Musacchio A. Salmon E.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar), our findings regarding the BUBR1-C-MAD2 interaction, in addition to the well characterized CDC20-C-MAD2 interaction (23Luo X. Fang G. Coldiron M. Lin Y. Yu H. Kirschner M.W. Wagner G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), establishes a biochemical connection between a signal transducer (C-MAD2) and an effector (MCC) of the mitotic checkpoint pathway. Our results also suggest that future efforts to reconstitute MCC for functional or structural studies will likely benefit from using C-conformer locked MAD2 instead of wild-type MAD2 that exists predominantly in the O-conformation. The molecular architecture of a functional MCC remains to be characterized further. Two possible explanations are proposed to incorporate our results with existing models (Fig. 4C). In the simplest scheme (model on the left), CDC20 binds MAD2 at the C-terminal safety belt, stabilizing MAD2 in the C-conformation and presenting the αC helix of C-MAD2 for direct interaction with BUBR1. The BUBR1-C-MAD2 interaction, involving residues Arg133 and Gln134 of MAD2 and the N-terminal 371 residues of BUBR1, may be facilitated by BUBR1-CDC20 interactions which rely on the KEN boxes in the N-terminal region and/or the second region between residues 400 and 750 of BUBR1. Although the two CDC20 binding domains of BUBR1 have been localized to nonoverlapping BUBR1 fragments (17Malureanu L.A. Jeganathan K.B. Hamada M. Wasilewski L. Davenport J. van Deursen J.M. Dev. Cell. 2009; 16: 118-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 18Davenport J. Harris L.D. Goorha R. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 1831-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22Tang Z. Bharadwaj R. Li B. Yu H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 227-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), whether full-length BUBR1 utilizes the two domains to bind two CDC20 molecules or different regions of a single CDC20 molecule remains to be defined. BUB3 forms a cell cycle-independent complex with BUBR1; however, the role of BUB3 in the MCC complex is unclear because the MCC isolated from S. pombe lacks detectable BUB3 (13Sczaniecka M. Feoktistova A. May K.M. Chen J.S. Blyth J. Gould K.L. Hardwick K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23039-23047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the second model (model on the right in Fig. 4C), we speculate that C-MAD2 binds to BUBR1 preferentially as a homodimer, based on the fact that the R133E/Q134A mutant disrupts MAD2 dimerization and meanwhile is unable to interact efficiently with BUBR1 (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 4 and supplemental Fig. S1). However, as homodimerization was suggested to only occur between “unliganded” C-MAD2 (7Yang M. Li B. Liu C.J. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Rizo J. Yu H. Luo X. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e50Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), it is difficult to imagine the relationship of the C:C-MAD2 homodimer to CDC20-bound C-MAD2 in a fully assembled MCC. The proposed MCC architecture models will open avenues for future study. For example, we realize that binding of either BUBR1 or C-MAD2 to the αC helix of C-MAD2 will block access of O-MAD2, thus formation of the MCC will naturally prevent “chronic C-MAD2 amplification,” a question raised for the model suggesting that “liganded C-MAD2” catalyzes O→C-MAD2 conversion (6Simonetta M. Manzoni R. Mosca R. Mapelli M. Massimiliano L. Vink M. Novak B. Musacchio A. Ciliberto A. PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e10Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 32Ciliberto A. Shah J.V. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2162-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Moreover, as p31comet, the negative regulator of the checkpoint, also binds to the αC helix of C-MAD2 (9Mapelli M. Filipp F.V. Rancati G. Massimiliano L. Nezi L. Stier G. Hagan R.S. Confalonieri S. Piatti S. Sattler M. Musacchio A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1273-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 10Yang M. Li B.

Indeed, a recent report has suggested that p31comet may interfere with MAD2 association with MCC, leading to MCC disassembly and checkpoint silencing (33Teichner A. Eytan E. Sitry-Shevah D.

Among them, the mitochondrial ryanodine receptor provides a fast Ca2+ uptake pathway across the inner membrane to control “excitation and metabolism coupling.” In the present study, we identified a novel ryanodine-sensitive channel in the native inner membrane of heart mitochondria and characterized its pharmacological and biophysical properties by directly patch clamping mitoplasts. Four distinct channel conductances of ∼100, ∼225, ∼700, and ∼1,000 picosiemens (pS) in symmetrical 150 mm CsCl were observed. The 225 pS cation-selective channel exhibited multiple subconductance states and was blocked by high concentrations of ryanodine and ruthenium red, known inhibitors of ryanodine receptors. Ryanodine exhibited a concentration-dependent modulation of this channel, with low concentrations stabilizing a subconductance state and high concentrations abolishing activity. The 100, 700, and 1,000 pS conductances exhibited different channel characteristics and were not inhibited by ryanodine. Taken together, these findings identified a novel 225 pS channel as the native mitochondrial ryanodine receptor channel activity in heart mitoplasts with biophysical and pharmacological properties that distinguish it from previously identified mitochondrial ion channels.

Ryanodine exhibited a concentration-dependent modulation of this channel, with low concentrations stabilizing a subconductance state and high concentrations abolishing activity. The 100, 700, and 1,000 pS conductances exhibited different channel characteristics and were not inhibited by ryanodine. Taken together, these findings identified a novel 225 pS channel as the native mitochondrial ryanodine receptor channel activity in heart mitoplasts with biophysical and pharmacological properties that distinguish it from previously identified mitochondrial ion channels."
https://openalex.org/W1990992754,"Previous studies showed that, from birth, speech and eye gaze are two important cues in guiding early face processing and social cognition. These studies tested the role of each cue independently; however, infants normally perceive speech and eye gaze together. Using a familiarization-test procedure, we first familiarized newborn infants (n = 24) with videos of unfamiliar talking faces with either direct gaze or averted gaze. Newborns were then tested with photographs of the previously seen face and of a new one. The newborns looked longer at the face that previously talked to them, but only in the direct gaze condition. These results highlight the importance of both speech and eye gaze as socio-communicative cues by which infants identify others. They suggest that gaze and infant-directed speech, experienced together, are powerful cues for the development of early social skills."

https://openalex.org/W2109253822,"The recent introduction of ""oxygen-independent"" flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-based fluorescent proteins (FbFPs) is of major interest to both eukaryotic and prokaryotic microbial biologists. Accordingly, we demonstrate for the first time that an obligate anaerobe, the successful opportunistic pathogen of the oral cavity, Porphyromonas gingivalis, can be genetically engineered for expression of the non-toxic green FbFP. The resulting transformants are functional for studying dynamic bacterial processes in living host cells. The visualization of the transformed P. gingivalis (PgFbFP) revealed strong fluorescence that reached a maximum emission at 495 nm as determined by fluorescence microscopy and spectrofluorometry. Human primary gingival epithelial cells (GECs) were infected with PgFbFP and the bacterial invasion of host cells was analyzed by a quantitative fluorescence microscopy and antibiotic protection assays. The results showed similar levels of intracellular bacteria for both wild type and PgFbFP strains. In conjunction with organelle specific fluorescent dyes, utilization of the transformed strain provided direct and accurate determination of the live/metabolically active P. gingivalis' trafficking in the GECs over time. Furthermore, the GECs were co-infected with PgFbFP and the ATP-dependent Clp serine protease-deficient mutant (ClpP-) to study the differential fates of the two strains within the same host cells. Quantitative co-localization analyses displayed the intracellular PgFbFP significantly associated with the endoplasmic reticulum network, whereas the majority of ClpP- organisms trafficked into the lysosomes. Hence, we have developed a novel and reliable method to characterize live host cell-microbe interactions and demonstrated the adaptability of FMN-green fluorescent protein for studying persistent host infections induced by obligate anaerobic organisms."

Inhibition or deletion of NPC1L1 reduces intestinal cholesterol absorption, resulting in reduction of plasma cholesterol levels. Principal Findings Here we present the 2.8 Å crystal structure of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of NPC1L1 in the absence of cholesterol. The structure, combined with biochemical data, reveals the mechanism of cholesterol selectivity of NPC1L1. Comparison to the cholesterol free and bound structures of NPC1(NTD) reveals that NPC1L1(NTD) is in a closed conformation and the sterol binding pocket is occluded from solvent. Conclusion The structure of NPC1L1(NTD) reveals a degree of flexibility surrounding the entrance to the sterol binding pocket, suggesting a gating mechanism that relies on multiple movements around the entrance to the sterol binding pocket."
https://openalex.org/W1964145646,"Internalization of Shigella into host epithelial cells, where the bacteria replicates and spreads to neighboring cells, requires a type 3 secretion system (T3SS) effector coined IpaA. IpaA binds directly to and activates the cytoskeletal protein vinculin after injection in the host cell cytosol, and this was previously thought to be directed by two amphipathic α-helical vinculin-binding sites (VBS) found in the C-terminal tail domain of IpaA. Here, we report a third VBS, IpaA-VBS3, that is located N-terminal to the other two VBSs of IpaA and show that one IpaA molecule can bind up to three vinculin molecules. Biochemical in vitro Shigella invasion assays and the 1.6 Å crystal structure of the vinculin·IpaA-VBS3 complex showed that IpaA-VBS3 is functionally redundant with the other two IpaA-VBSs in cell invasion and in activating the latent F-actin binding functions of vinculin. Multiple VBSs in IpaA are reminiscent of talin, which harbors 11 VBSs. However, most of the talin VBSs have low affinity and are buried in helix bundles, whereas all three of the VBSs of IpaA are high affinity, readily available, and in close proximity to each other in the IpaA structure. Although deletion of IpaA-VBS3 has no detectable effects on Shigella invasion of epithelial cells, deletion of all three VBSs impaired bacterial invasion to levels found in an ipaA null mutant strain. Thus, IpaA-directed mimicry of talin in activating vinculin occurs through three high affinity VBSs that are essential for Shigella pathogenesis."

Here, we studied the effect of progesterone on the expression, trafficking, and function of HERG channels and the underlying mechanism. Treatment with progesterone for 24 h decreased the abundance of the fully glycosylated form of the HERG channel in rat neonatal cardiac myocytes and HERG-HEK293 cells, a cell line stably expressing HERG channels. Progesterone also concentration-dependently decreased HERG current density, but had no effect on voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ and K+ channels. Immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis show that progesterone preferentially decreased HERG channel protein abundance in the plasma membrane, induced protein accumulation in the dilated endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and increased the protein expression of C/EBP homologous protein, a hallmark of ER stress. Application of 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (a sterol-binding agent) or overexpression of Rab9 rescued the progesterone-induced HERG trafficking defect and ER stress. Disruption of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis with simvastatin, imipramine, or exogenous application of cholesterol mimicked the effect of progesterone on HERG channel trafficking. Progesterone may impair HERG channel folding in the ER and/or block its trafficking to the Golgi complex by disrupting intracellular cholesterol homeostasis.

The underlying mechanism is uncertain, but 4PBA modulates the expression of some cytosolic molecular chaperones. To identify other 4PBA-regulated proteins that might regulate ΔF508-CFTR trafficking, we performed a differential display RT-PCR screen on IB3-1 CF bronchiolar epithelial cells exposed to 4PBA. One transcript up-regulated by 4PBA encoded ERp29, a luminal resident of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) thought to be a novel molecular chaperone. We tested the hypothesis that ERp29 is a 4PBA-regulated ER chaperone that influences ΔF508-CFTR trafficking. ERp29 mRNA and protein expression was significantly increased (∼1.5-fold) in 4PBA-treated IB3-1 cells. In Xenopus oocytes, ERp29 overexpression increased the functional expression of both wild-type and ΔF508-CFTR over 3-fold and increased wild-type cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) plasma membrane expression. In CFBE41o- WT-CFTR cells, expression of and short circuit currents mediated by CFTR decreased upon depletion of ERp29 as did maturation of newly synthesized CFTR. In IB3-1 cells, ΔF508-CFTR co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous ERp29, and overexpression of ERp29 led to increased ΔF508-CFTR expression at the plasma membrane. These data suggest that ERp29 is a 4PBA-regulated ER chaperone that regulates WT-CFTR biogenesis and can promote ΔF508-CFTR trafficking in CF epithelial cells."

https://openalex.org/W2124541920,"In the context of social foraging, predator detection has been the subject of numerous studies, which acknowledge the adaptive response of the individual to the trade-off between feeding and vigilance. Typically, animals gain energy by increasing their feeding time and decreasing their vigilance effort with increasing group size, without increasing their risk of predation ('group size effect'). Research on the biological utility of vigilance has prevailed over considerations of the mechanistic rules that link individual decisions to group behavior. With sheep as a model species, we identified how the behaviors of conspecifics affect the individual decisions to switch activity. We highlight a simple mechanism whereby the group size effect on collective vigilance dynamics is shaped by two key features: the magnitude of social amplification and intrinsic differences between foraging and scanning bout durations. Our results highlight a positive correlation between the duration of scanning and foraging bouts at the level of the group. This finding reveals the existence of groups with high and low rates of transition between activities, suggesting individual variations in the transition rate, or 'tempo'. We present a mathematical model based on behavioral rules derived from experiments. Our theoretical predictions show that the system is robust in respect to variations in the propensity to imitate scanning and foraging, yet flexible in respect to differences in the duration of activity bouts. The model shows how individual decisions contribute to collective behavior patterns and how the group, in turn, facilitates individual-level adaptive responses."

Compared with wild-type Agtr1a+/+ mice, AT1 receptor knock-out (Agtr1a−/−) mice were hyperphagic and obese with increased adiposity on an ad libitum diet, whereas Agtr1a−/− mice were lean with decreased adiposity on a pair-fed diet.

Furthermore, intracerebroventricular administration of CRH suppressed food intake both in Agtr1a+/+ and Agtr1a−/− mice. In addition, the Crh gene promoter was significantly transactivated via the cAMP-responsive element by angiotensin II stimulation.

Both the long (p85) and short (p70) S6K1 isoforms were phosphorylated in a PLD1-dependent way. Short rapamycin treatment specifically inhibiting mTORC1 suppressed p70 but not p85 phosphorylation, suggesting that p85 might be directly activated by phosphatidic acid. Vasopressin stimulation also induced phosphorylation of Akt on Ser-473 through PLD1-dependent activation of mTORC2 complex. In this model of myogenesis, mTORC2 had a positive role mostly unrelated to Akt activation, whereas mTORC1 had a negative role, associated with S6K1-induced Rictor phosphorylation.

Cells were then collected, lipids were extracted, and phosphatidylbutanol was separated by bidimensional TLC as described in Zeiller et al. (32Zeiller C. Mebarek S. Jaafar R. Pirola L. Lagarde M. Prigent A.F. Némoz G. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2009; 1793: 1236-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). TLC plates were then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R, phosphatidylbutanol spots were scraped off, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Radioactivity associated with phosphatidylbutanol was expressed as a percentage of total phospholipid radioactivity. Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1.5 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton, and protease inhibitor mixture (pH 7.6). Lysates were kept on ice for 15 min and cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Cell lysates were separated by SDS/PAGE. Particular sample treatment and electrophoresis conditions for PLD analysis have already been described (25Komati H. Naro F. Mebarek S. De Arcangelis V.

Proteins were transferred onto PVDF membranes blocked with 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with the various antibodies following the manufacturer's recommendations. Immunoblots were revealed with the ECL detection system (Pierce) and quantified with Image J software. Myogenin nuclear accumulation was detected by immunofluorescence. The cells were fixed by 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton for 10 min at room temperature, and aspecific labeling was blocked in 1% BSA for 20 min. Anti-myogenin F5D monoclonal antibody was added undiluted and incubated overnight at room temperature. After washing with 1% BSA in PBS, fluorescein- or rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody was added, diluted 1:1000 in 1% BSA, for 1 h. Nuclei were stained with 1 μg/ml 4.5-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 3 min. The cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy with an Axiovert 200 microscope, an objective LD A-plan, 20×/0.30 PHI ∞/40, an Axiocam MRm camera, and Axiovision 4.1 image acquisition software (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). The total number of nuclei in the considered fields was assessed on phase contrast images or after nuclei staining with DAPI. The siRNA used were targeted to rat PLD1 sequence 5′-AAGTTAAGAGGAAATTCAAGC-3′, rat PLD2 sequence 5′-GACACAAAGTCTTGATGAG-3′, rat PKCα sequence 5′-GAAGCAAGCACAAGTTCAA-3′, rat Raptor sequence 5′-GACAGTGGGCCTCTCAGGA-3′, and rat Rictor sequence 5′-GTTCGTTCCGACACTATAA-3′. Transfection of siRNAs was performed using Hiperfect reagent (Qiagene) with 50 nm siRNA for 48 h, and medium was changed after 24 h of transfection. Total RNA was isolated from L6 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). After quantification, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed in the presence of 100 units of Superscript II (Invitrogen) using random hexamers and oligo(dT). Real-time PCR was performed with the Fast Start DNA Master SYBR Green kit using Rotor-Gene 6000 (Corbett Research, Mortlake, Australia). Data were analyzed using LightCycler software (Roche Diagnostics) and normalized to the TATA-binding protein (TBP) housekeeping gene transcripts. Alternatively, for RT-PCR of IGF-2 mRNA, 1 μg total RNA was processed with Access RT-PCR kit (Promega). Specific Sense and Antisense Primers Used for Amplification Were: myogenin sense (CAATGCACTGGAGTTTGGTC) and myogenin antisense (CATATCCTCCACCGTGATGC); PLD1 sense (GGTCAGAAAGATAACCCAGG) and PLD1 antisense (GAAGCGAGACAGCGAAATGG); PLD2 sense (TTGCTGGCTGTGTGTCTGGC) and PLD2 antisense (GGACCTCCAGAGACACAAAG); troponin I skeletal slow 1 sense (TGAGGAGCGCTATGATATCG) and troponin I skeletal slow 1 antisense (TTCACAGACTTGAGGTTGGC); IGF-2 sense (GGAAGTCGATGTTGGTGCTT) and IGF-2 antisense (CGAGATCTTCATGAGGTAGTC). Recombinant adenoviral genomes carrying the HA-tagged cDNA of interest (hPLD1b, hPLD2, or GFP) were generated as previously described (32Zeiller C. Mebarek S. Jaafar R. Pirola L. Lagarde M. Prigent A.F. Némoz G. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2009; 1793: 1236-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Infections were performed at a multiplicity of infection of 100 in complete medium. After 12 h of incubation in the presence of viral particles, the medium was changed, and cells were cultured for 24–72 h. Under these conditions, >75% of the cells expressed GFP. Data expressed as the means ± S.E. were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and means were compared by a protected t test. p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. We first investigated the effects of AVP, a PLD agonist that strongly enhances the differentiation of L6 cells in low serum culture conditions, on the phosphorylation status of protein substrates of the mTORC1 complex. AVP markedly stimulated the phosphorylation of both p70 and p85 isoforms of S6K1 on the mTORC1 target residues (Thr-389 on p70-S6K1 and the homologous Thr-412 on p85-S6K1) (Fig. 1A). In addition, the mTORC1 substrate 4E-BP1 and S6 ribosomal protein, a substrate of S6K1, were phosphorylated in response to AVP (not shown). The induction of differentiation was thus accompanied by mTORC1 and S6K1 activation. As a confirmation of mTORC1 involvement in the response to AVP, we assessed the effects on S6K1 phosphorylation of depletion of Raptor, a specific component of mTORC1 complex. siRNA-induced Raptor silencing (i.e. inactivation of mTORC1), but not Rictor silencing (i.e. inactivation of mTORC2), markedly decreased AVP-induced phosphorylation of p70 and p85 S6K1 isoforms (Fig. 1B).FIGURE 1PLD is required for S6K1 phosphorylation. A, left panel, as a control for the immunodetection of S6K1 isoforms, L6 myoblasts were transfected with pMT2-S6K1, which expresses both p85- and p70-S6K1 (52Coffer P.J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem.

The blots show that both p70 and p85 isoforms can be detected by the anti-protein antibody and by the anti-phosphoprotein antibody. Right panel, L6 myoblasts were serum-starved overnight and treated with 10−7 m AVP for the indicated times, and cell lysates were analyzed as above. B, shown is a Western blot of cells transfected with 50 nm control siRNA, Raptor-siRNA, or Rictor-siRNA and stimulated for 40 min with 10–7 M AVP. C and D, cells were serum-starved overnight and pretreated or not with 0.5% 1-butanol (BuOH1) or 2-butanol (BuOH2) for 30 min before 40 min of stimulation by 10−7 m AVP or 100 μm dioctanoyl-PA (PA-diC8) or 100 μm propranolol (propra). E, cells were transfected with 50 nm control siRNA or PLD1-siRNA or PLD2-siRNA for 48 h, serum-starved overnight, and stimulated by AVP for 40 min. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to assess the efficiency of PLD1 and PLD2 knockdown (left diagram, means ± S.E. of at least four determinations). The cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot (right panel). F, cells were infected with GFP-adenovirus or PLD1-adenovirus or PLD2-adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 100 for 48 h, serum-starved overnight, and stimulated by AVP for 40 min. The cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot (right panel). The efficiency of PLD overexpression was assessed in control Western blots of cells infected at various multiplicities of infection and probed with either anti-PLD1 antibody or anti-HA tag antibody for recombinant PLD2 detection (left panel). G, cells were shifted to serum-free medium and pretreated for 40 min with 100 nm rapamycin (rapa) before 40 min of treatment with 10−7 m AVP or 100 μm propranolol (propra). The cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for total and Thr-389/Thr-412-phosphorylated S6K1. The diagrams show the quantification of Rictor, Raptor, or phospho-S6K1 isoforms in the Western blot above after normalization by either tubulin or the S6K1 proteins (mean ± S.E. of three determinations except diagram G, right : data of one experiment representative of two performed). *, significantly different from control cells, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the activation of the mTORC1 pathway by AVP involved PLD, 1-butanol, which specifically prevents the formation of PA, the normal product of PLD, was added to the cells. We observed that 1-butanol more efficiently inhibited S6K1 phosphorylation than 2-butanol, an isomer not recognized by PLD used as a control for aspecific alcohol effects, showing that AVP-induced S6K1 phosphorylation requires PLD activity (Fig. 1C). This was confirmed by using compounds that mimic PLD activation. The addition to the cells of either exogenous PA or propranolol, an inhibitor of PA phosphatase that induces an accumulation of endogenous PA, induced S6K1 phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). To identify the PLD isoform(s) that is responsible for the regulation of S6K1, selective silencing of either PLD1 or PLD2 isoform was performed by using siRNAs. Depletion of PLD1 strongly decreased S6K1 phosphorylation, whereas PLD2 silencing was less efficient. In agreement, the adenovirus-induced overexpression of PLD1 strongly enhanced S6K1 phosphorylation, PLD2 overexpression being less effective. (Fig. 1, E and F). These results strongly suggest that PLD, and especially the PLD1 isoform, regulates S6K1 phosphorylation on critical positions, and as a consequence, S6K1 activity in L6 cells induced to differentiate. Because the activity of mTOR kinase is regulated by PA binding (5Sun Y. Chen J. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 3118-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 6Foster D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we asked whether the effects of the PLD and PA level changes on S6K1 were solely mediated by mTORC1 action. To this end, the cells were submitted to a short treatment by rapamycin (40 min) in conditions known to suppress only mTORC1 activity (Fig. 1G). This treatment totally suppressed the activation of p70 phosphorylation by either AVP or propranolol, showing that PA-dependent p70-S6K1 phosphorylation was entirely mediated by mTORC1. Instead, p85-S6K1 phosphorylation was incompletely inhibited by rapamycin, showing that p85-S6K1 can be in part activated by PA in a mTORC1/rapamycin-independent way. Upon AVP stimulation, the phosphorylation of Ser-473 on Akt was rapidly increased, the peak of phosphorylation being reached in 6–8 min. This Akt activation also involved the participation of PLD, as it was reproduced by treatment of the cells by exogenous PA or propranolol (Fig. 2A). PLD implication was further supported by the effect of PLD isoforms overexpression, PLD1 inducing a marked increase in Akt phosphorylation, whereas PLD2 was less effective (Fig. 2B). In agreement, siRNA-mediated depletion of PLD, especially PLD1, decreased Ser-473-Phospho-Akt in the presence of AVP (Fig. 2C). It is well known that phosphorylation of Ser-473 position on Akt can be mediated by the mTORC2 complex. To verify the participation of mTORC2 in PA-stimulated Akt phosphorylation, siRNA silencing experiments were performed. Depletion of Rictor, but not of Raptor, inhibited Akt phosphorylation induced by AVP (Fig. 2D) or propranolol (not shown), showing that it was mTORC2-dependent and mTORC1-independent. Besides siRNA silencing, another means to deplete cells in mTORC2 complex is the use of longer term treatment by rapamycin (3Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Sengupta S. Sheen J.H. Hsu P.P. Bagley A.F. Markhard A.L. Sabatini D.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 159-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). 24-h rapamycin inhibited Akt phosphorylation induced by AVP or propranolol, in agreement with the conclusion that it was mediated by mTORC2 activation (Fig. 2E). We had previously proposed that PLD activity is required for in vitro myogenic differentiation (24Komati H. Minasi A. Naro F. Lagarde M. Prigent A.F. Adamo S. Némoz G. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 25Komati H. Naro F. Mebarek S. De Arcangelis V. Adamo S. Lagarde M. Prigent A.F. Némoz G. Mol. Biol.

In further support to this conclusion, we observed in the present work that fluoro-2-indolyldeschlorohalopemide, a potent synthetic inhibitor of both PLD isoforms (28Monovich L. Mugrage B. Quadros E.

Pharmacol. 2009; 75: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), almost totally suppressed AVP-induced PA accumulation at 250 nm (Fig. 3A) and dose-dependently inhibited myogenin expression with an approximate EC50 of 100 nm (Fig. 3B). Isoform-specific PLD inhibitors were also studied (30Scott S.A. Selvy P.E. Buck J.R. Cho H.P. Criswell T.L. Thomas A.L. Armstrong M.D. Arteaga C.L. Lindsley C.W. Brown H.A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Each of the PLD1- and PLD2-specific inhibitors used at 50 nm roughly inhibited by 50% AVP-induced PA accumulation (Fig. 3A). However, they had clearly different effects on myogenin expression. The PLD1 inhibitor dose-dependently inhibited this response with an approximate EC50 of 5 nm, whereas the PLD2 inhibitor had no significant effect up to 500 nm (Fig. 3C). The observation that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of the PLD1 isoform increased the percentage of myogenin-positive nuclei in cells after 48 h in differentiation medium, further supported the positive involvement of PLD1 in the myogenic response (Fig. 3D). In agreement with what was observed by numerous groups with different myogenic cell types, we observed a complete blockade of myogenic differentiation of L6 cells in the presence of rapamycin. However, at variance with what was observed by others in C2C12 cells (4Shu L. Houghton P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 4691-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we observed a total inhibition of myogenic response at the very early steps of myogenin expression (mRNA, protein) and nuclear accumulation, i.e. before the cell fusion step (Fig. 4A). This showed that either mTORC1 or mTORC2 complexes are required for the early myogenic response. To discriminate between the role of each of the two complexes, differentiation was assessed during their respective siRNA-mediated depletion. As shown in Fig. 4B, Raptor silencing (i.e. inactivation of mTORC1) had a positive effect on either myogenin expression or nuclear accumulation. Conversely, Rictor silencing (i.e. inactivation of mTORC2) decreased the early myogenic responses, showing that mTORC2 is required for myogenic differentiation, whereas mTORC1 negatively regulates it. Consistent with this latter conclusion, we observed that overexpression of the mTORC1 effector S6K1 had negative effects on the expression of myogenin and troponin, a sarcomeric protein marker of advanced differentiation (Fig. 4C). Because a negative regulation of mTORC2 by mTORC1/S6K1 cascade through phosphorylation of Rictor on threonine 1135 has been reported (33Julien L.A. Carriere A. Moreau J. Roux P.P. Mol. Cell.

IntroductionFormation of the transcription-competent open promoter complex (RPo) by DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP) 3The abbreviations used are: RNAPRNA polymeraseTMRtetramethylrhodamine. is a critical checkpoint on the pathway of gene expression. In bacteria, the transition from initial recognition of the promoter by RNAP to RPo proceeds through a series of short-lived intermediate complexes (1Buc H. McClure W.R.

In RPo, the DNA duplex is disrupted over a stretch of 12–15 base pairs, which leads to the formation of the transcription bubble and makes the transcription start point (position +1) accessible to the RNAP catalytic center (4Kirkegaard K.

An important source of energy driving this strand separation process is the interaction of the RNAP σ70 subunit region 2 with the non-template strand of the −10 promoter element at the upstream edge of the transcription bubble (6Roberts C.W.

Indeed, RNAP mutations that change RNAP contacts with downstream DNA reduce the longevity of open complexes formed at certain promoters (15Bartlett M.S. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R.L. J. Mol.

Here, we introduce downstream fork junction fragments as a tool to study the structure and function of the downstream segment of the RPo. The downstream fork junction promoter fragments used consist of stretches of short single-stranded non-template DNA containing the −10 promoter element followed by double-stranded downstream segments of various lengths. We find that specific binding of RNAP to downstream fork junctions can be quantitatively measured using a protein beacon assay method (9Mekler V. Pavlova O. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 270-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that RNAP complexes with downstream forks mimic RNAP complexes with native promoters in several discriminative biochemical tests. Consequently, certain downstream fork junctions can be used as transcription templates. Our experiments reveal that RNAP interaction with the downstream promoter duplex is strong and provides ∼5.5 kcal/mol binding energy in the context of downstream fork junction probes. We identify structural determinants of affinity and transcription activity of RNAP-downstream fork junction complexes. Our data show that RNAP interactions with downstream promoter DNA play a critical role in open promoter complex formation and may be subject to regulation.DISCUSSIONHere we quantitatively investigated downstream RNAP-promoter interactions using a new class of model promoter fragments, which we call a downstream fork junction. We found that these new DNA probes mimicked the corresponding downstream part of promoter DNA in all respects and function as the −10 element-dependent transcription templates. Specific affinity of short downstream fork junction templates to RNAP and real-time binding kinetics can be measured readily with the beacon assay. Thus, the downstream fork junctions are a useful new tool for studying the structure and function of the downstream RPo segment.It has been previously proposed that RNAP contacts with an ∼20-nt-long promoter DNA duplex located downstream of the transcription start can play a significant role in stabilization of RPo (16Ederth J.

Biol. 2008; 376: 1034-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our direct measurements of RNAP binding to a set of downstream fork junctions reveal that RNAP affinity to the downstream duplex is quite high. The data in Table 1 show that this tight binding apparently results from individually rather modest contributions of many RNAP-DNA contacts. Indeed, every consecutive 1-base pair extension of the duplex is estimated to increase the binding by less than 7-fold. The lack of strongly localized contacts may favor smooth RNAP sliding along the downstream DNA duplex during transcription.We have investigated the effect of the double-stranded/single-stranded boundary position on downstream fork junction affinity to RNAP and found that the maximal affinity is reached when the boundary is located between bp +2 to +4. Therefore, the stability of RNAP complex with downstream fork junction is one of the factors that determines the position of the downstream boundary of the transcription bubble. Conversely, RNAP binding to downstream forks whose junction point is located upstream of position +2 should destabilize the DNA duplex segment surrounding the transcription start point. Specific transcription activity of downstream forks confirms the existence of such promoter DNA melting activity that is driven by RNAP interactions with the downstream junction.In principle, strand separation in RPo can be maintained solely through strong RNAP interactions with single-stranded DNA, both template and non-template strands, within the bubble. However, the non-template strand fragment surrounding the transcription start point and the entire template strand part of the transcription bubble interact with RNAP comparatively weakly in the context of model promoter fragments (8Guo Y. Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 11655-11660Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 9Mekler V. Pavlova O. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 270-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, the energy of these interactions may be insufficient to support the downstream propagation of promoter melting, in particular when the DNA sequence around the transcription start is G/C reach. Coupling melting with interaction of RNAP with the downstream promoter duplex, a highly energetically favorable process, may provide additional driving force for promoter melting.Applying the beacon assay to a set of double-stranded promoter fragments allowed further evaluation of RNAP interactions with various downstream promoter segments (shown in Fig. 7). The [−40/−7] probe truncated just downstream of the −10 element showed most rapid and very tight binding. Extension of the downstream edge from base pair −7 to +2 inhibited the binding, in agreement with previous data (26Fenton M.S. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39669-39674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and extension from position +2 to +6 led to further inhibition. However, the binding affinity was recovered upon further extension of the downstream double-stranded segment, indicating that a critical length required for effective RNAP binding had been reached. These results are consistent with a view that RNAP binding to a promoter segment surrounding the transcription start site represents a barrier on the pathway to RPo (13Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1280-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 14Vassylyev D.G. Sekine S. Laptenko O. Lee J. Vassylyeva M.N. Borukhov S. Yokoyama S.

Biol. 2011; 10.1016/j.jmb.2011.01.018Google Scholar). Favorable interactions established upon filling in the RNAP downstream DNA binding site with DNA of sufficient length overcome this barrier and thus lead to formation of RPo.Some downstream fork junctions support highly efficient transcription with a start site located within the duplex DNA and matching a start site expected on double-stranded promoters. This is in contrast with results obtained with 3′ tailed templates composed of duplex DNA with a 3′ single-stranded extension. Such templates support transcription initiation by bacterial and eukaryotic RNA polymerases (47Dedrick R.L. Chamberlin M.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2245-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 48Helmann J.D. deHaseth P.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5959-5967Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), but initiation occurs at the boundary of single-stranded and double-stranded segments of the template (48Helmann J.D. deHaseth P.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5959-5967Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Neither in vitro transcription nor beacon assays revealed transcription activity of the [−12/+16][+1/+16] fork junction bearing no template strand bases upstream from +1, whereas a fork junction having the junction point at −1 showed only weak transcription activity. Similarly, E. coli σ70 RNAP holoenzyme transcription from a minimal M13 bacteriophage DNA fragment was found to be dependent on a three-nucleotide stretch upstream of the transcription start point (49Zenkin N. Severinov K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 4396-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Shortening of this single-stranded extension abolished transcription (49Zenkin N. Severinov K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 4396-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These data correlate with results on yeast RNAP III transcription from model non-transcribed strand promoter templates (50Schroder O. Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 934-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The templates resemble downstream fork junctions used in this work but are much longer because they contain a non-transcribed strand comprising the entire upstream promoter segment and bear a long downstream duplex. Such templates bearing bottom strands truncated at the +1 position yielded a low amount of transcription product (50Schroder O. Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 934-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), similarly to the result that we observed with the [−12/+16][+1/+16] fork junction. This effect has been explained by the existence of requirements for anchoring of the transcribed strand of the transcription bubble relative to the enzyme active site (50Schroder O. Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 934-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Transcription from downstream fork junctions may similarly depend on proper positioning of short bottom strand segment just upstream of the transcription start site in a specific RNAP site. Overall, the data presented here strongly argue that establishment of specific contacts between a segment of double-stranded DNA located 2–4 nucleotides downstream of the transcription initiation start point is a major force that governs the formation and controls stability of transcription-competent promoter complex in bacteria and may thus be a subject of genetic regulation. The use of model substrates mimicking the downstream portion of DNA in the open complex opens a way for functional dissection of these interactions and for direct structural analysis of RNAP interactions with downstream promoter DNA. IntroductionFormation of the transcription-competent open promoter complex (RPo) by DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP) 3The abbreviations used are: RNAPRNA polymeraseTMRtetramethylrhodamine. is a critical checkpoint on the pathway of gene expression. In bacteria, the transition from initial recognition of the promoter by RNAP to RPo proceeds through a series of short-lived intermediate complexes (1Buc H. McClure W.R.

In RPo, the DNA duplex is disrupted over a stretch of 12–15 base pairs, which leads to the formation of the transcription bubble and makes the transcription start point (position +1) accessible to the RNAP catalytic center (4Kirkegaard K.

An important source of energy driving this strand separation process is the interaction of the RNAP σ70 subunit region 2 with the non-template strand of the −10 promoter element at the upstream edge of the transcription bubble (6Roberts C.W.

The downstream fork junction promoter fragments used consist of stretches of short single-stranded non-template DNA containing the −10 promoter element followed by double-stranded downstream segments of various lengths. We find that specific binding of RNAP to downstream fork junctions can be quantitatively measured using a protein beacon assay method (9Mekler V. Pavlova O. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 270-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that RNAP complexes with downstream forks mimic RNAP complexes with native promoters in several discriminative biochemical tests. Consequently, certain downstream fork junctions can be used as transcription templates. Our experiments reveal that RNAP interaction with the downstream promoter duplex is strong and provides ∼5.5 kcal/mol binding energy in the context of downstream fork junction probes. We identify structural determinants of affinity and transcription activity of RNAP-downstream fork junction complexes. Our data show that RNAP interactions with downstream promoter DNA play a critical role in open promoter complex formation and may be subject to regulation. DISCUSSIONHere we quantitatively investigated downstream RNAP-promoter interactions using a new class of model promoter fragments, which we call a downstream fork junction. We found that these new DNA probes mimicked the corresponding downstream part of promoter DNA in all respects and function as the −10 element-dependent transcription templates. Specific affinity of short downstream fork junction templates to RNAP and real-time binding kinetics can be measured readily with the beacon assay. Thus, the downstream fork junctions are a useful new tool for studying the structure and function of the downstream RPo segment.It has been previously proposed that RNAP contacts with an ∼20-nt-long promoter DNA duplex located downstream of the transcription start can play a significant role in stabilization of RPo (16Ederth J.

Biol. 2008; 376: 1034-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our direct measurements of RNAP binding to a set of downstream fork junctions reveal that RNAP affinity to the downstream duplex is quite high. The data in Table 1 show that this tight binding apparently results from individually rather modest contributions of many RNAP-DNA contacts. Indeed, every consecutive 1-base pair extension of the duplex is estimated to increase the binding by less than 7-fold. The lack of strongly localized contacts may favor smooth RNAP sliding along the downstream DNA duplex during transcription.We have investigated the effect of the double-stranded/single-stranded boundary position on downstream fork junction affinity to RNAP and found that the maximal affinity is reached when the boundary is located between bp +2 to +4. Therefore, the stability of RNAP complex with downstream fork junction is one of the factors that determines the position of the downstream boundary of the transcription bubble. Conversely, RNAP binding to downstream forks whose junction point is located upstream of position +2 should destabilize the DNA duplex segment surrounding the transcription start point. Specific transcription activity of downstream forks confirms the existence of such promoter DNA melting activity that is driven by RNAP interactions with the downstream junction.In principle, strand separation in RPo can be maintained solely through strong RNAP interactions with single-stranded DNA, both template and non-template strands, within the bubble. However, the non-template strand fragment surrounding the transcription start point and the entire template strand part of the transcription bubble interact with RNAP comparatively weakly in the context of model promoter fragments (8Guo Y. Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 11655-11660Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 9Mekler V. Pavlova O. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 270-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, the energy of these interactions may be insufficient to support the downstream propagation of promoter melting, in particular when the DNA sequence around the transcription start is G/C reach. Coupling melting with interaction of RNAP with the downstream promoter duplex, a highly energetically favorable process, may provide additional driving force for promoter melting.Applying the beacon assay to a set of double-stranded promoter fragments allowed further evaluation of RNAP interactions with various downstream promoter segments (shown in Fig. 7). The [−40/−7] probe truncated just downstream of the −10 element showed most rapid and very tight binding. Extension of the downstream edge from base pair −7 to +2 inhibited the binding, in agreement with previous data (26Fenton M.S. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39669-39674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and extension from position +2 to +6 led to further inhibition. However, the binding affinity was recovered upon further extension of the downstream double-stranded segment, indicating that a critical length required for effective RNAP binding had been reached. These results are consistent with a view that RNAP binding to a promoter segment surrounding the transcription start site represents a barrier on the pathway to RPo (13Murakami K.S. Masuda S.

Favorable interactions established upon filling in the RNAP downstream DNA binding site with DNA of sufficient length overcome this barrier and thus lead to formation of RPo.Some downstream fork junctions support highly efficient transcription with a start site located within the duplex DNA and matching a start site expected on double-stranded promoters. This is in contrast with results obtained with 3′ tailed templates composed of duplex DNA with a 3′ single-stranded extension. Such templates support transcription initiation by bacterial and eukaryotic RNA polymerases (47Dedrick R.L. Chamberlin M.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2245-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 48Helmann J.D. deHaseth P.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5959-5967Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), but initiation occurs at the boundary of single-stranded and double-stranded segments of the template (48Helmann J.D. deHaseth P.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5959-5967Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Neither in vitro transcription nor beacon assays revealed transcription activity of the [−12/+16][+1/+16] fork junction bearing no template strand bases upstream from +1, whereas a fork junction having the junction point at −1 showed only weak transcription activity. Similarly, E. coli σ70 RNAP holoenzyme transcription from a minimal M13 bacteriophage DNA fragment was found to be dependent on a three-nucleotide stretch upstream of the transcription start point (49Zenkin N. Severinov K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 4396-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Shortening of this single-stranded extension abolished transcription (49Zenkin N. Severinov K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 4396-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These data correlate with results on yeast RNAP III transcription from model non-transcribed strand promoter templates (50Schroder O. Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 934-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The templates resemble downstream fork junctions used in this work but are much longer because they contain a non-transcribed strand comprising the entire upstream promoter segment and bear a long downstream duplex. Such templates bearing bottom strands truncated at the +1 position yielded a low amount of transcription product (50Schroder O. Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 934-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), similarly to the result that we observed with the [−12/+16][+1/+16] fork junction. This effect has been explained by the existence of requirements for anchoring of the transcribed strand of the transcription bubble relative to the enzyme active site (50Schroder O. Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 934-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Transcription from downstream fork junctions may similarly depend on proper positioning of short bottom strand segment just upstream of the transcription start site in a specific RNAP site. Overall, the data presented here strongly argue that establishment of specific contacts between a segment of double-stranded DNA located 2–4 nucleotides downstream of the transcription initiation start point is a major force that governs the formation and controls stability of transcription-competent promoter complex in bacteria and may thus be a subject of genetic regulation. The use of model substrates mimicking the downstream portion of DNA in the open complex opens a way for functional dissection of these interactions and for direct structural analysis of RNAP interactions with downstream promoter DNA.

https://openalex.org/W2054418418,"Background Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus) is a leading cause of sepsis and meningitis in newborns. Most bacterial pathogens, including gram-positive bacteria, have long filamentous structures known as pili extending from their surface. Although pili are described as adhesive organelles, they have been also implicated in many other functions including thwarting the host immune responses. We previously characterized the pilus-encoding operon PI-2a (gbs1479-1474) in strain NEM316. This pilus is composed of three structural subunit proteins: PilA (Gbs1478), PilB (Gbs1477), and PilC (Gbs1474), and its assembly involves two class C sortases (SrtC3 and SrtC4). PilB, the bona fide pilin, is the major component whereas PilA, the pilus associated adhesin, and PilC the pilus anchor are both accessory proteins incorporated into the pilus backbone. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, the role of the major pilin subunit PilB was tested in systemic virulence using 6-weeks old and newborn mice. Notably, the non-piliated ΔpilB mutant was less virulent than its wild-type counterpart in the newborn mice model. Next, we investigated the possible role(s) of PilB in resistance to innate immune host defenses, i.e. resistance to macrophage killing and to antimicrobial peptides. Phagocytosis and survival of wild-type NEM316 and its isogenic ΔpilB mutant in immortalized RAW 264.7 murine macrophages were not significantly different whereas the isogenic ΔsodA mutant was more susceptible to killing. These results were confirmed using primary peritoneal macrophages. We also tested the activities of five cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMP-1D, LL-37, colistin, polymyxin B, and mCRAMP) and found no significant difference between WT and ΔpilB strains whereas the isogenic dltA mutant showed increased sensitivity. Conclusions/Significance These results question the previously described role of PilB pilus in resistance to the host immune defenses. Interestingly, PilB was found to be important for virulence in the neonatal context."

The BZLF1 promoter (Zp) normally exhibits only low basal activity but is activated in response to chemical inducers such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and calcium ionophore. We found that Jun dimerization protein 2 (JDP2) plays a significant role in suppressing Zp activity. Reporter, EMSA, and ChIP assays of a Zp mutant virus revealed JDP2 association with Zp at the ZII cis-element, a binding site for CREB/ATF/AP-1. Suppression of Zp activity by JDP2 correlated with HDAC3 association and reduced levels of histone acetylation. Although introduction of point mutations into the ZII element of the viral genome did not increase the level of BZLF1 production, silencing of endogenous JDP2 gene expression by RNA interference increased the levels of viral early gene products and viral DNA replication. These results indicate that JDP2 plays a role as a repressor of Zp and that its replacement by CREB/ATF/AP-1 at ZII is crucial to triggering reactivation from latency to lytic replication.

Only a small percentage of infected cells switch from the latent stage into the lytic cycle to produce progeny viruses. Although the mechanism of EBV reactivation in vivo is not fully understood, it is known to be elicited by treatment of latently infected B cells with chemical or biological reagents, such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), calcium ionophore, sodium butyrate, or anti-immunoglobulin, at least in cultured cells. Stimulation of the EBV lytic cascade by any of these leads to expression of two immediate-early genes, BZLF1 and BRLF1. The BZLF1 protein is a transcriptional activator that shares structural similarities to basic leucine zipper (b-Zip) family transcriptional factors and acts as an oriLyt binding protein essential for lytic viral DNA replication. BZLF1 expression alone can trigger the entire reactivation cascade (1Speck S.H. Chatila T. Flemington E.

Expression of the BZLF1 gene is tightly controlled at the transcriptional level. The BZLF1 promoter (Zp) normally exhibits low basal activity and is activated in response to TPA or the other reagents described above. The minimal sequence of Zp necessary for activation by the inducers is 233 bp in length (4Flemington E. Speck S.H. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The region harbors at least three types of cis regulatory elements, referred to as ZI, ZII, and ZIII. Four copies of the ZI element (ZIA–D) are distributed within the minimal Zp. The myocyte enhancer factor 2D binds to ZIA, ZIB, and ZID (5Liu S. Liu P. Borras A. Chatila T. Speck S.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), whereas Sp1 or Sp3 can bind to ZIA, ZIC, and ZID (6Liu S. Borras A.M. Liu P. Suske G. Speck S.H. Virology. 1997; 228: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A single ZII element is located near TATA, sharing homology with binding sites for the cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), activating transcription factor (ATF), and activator protein-1 (AP-1) family transcriptional factors such as JunB and JunD (7Liu P.

Two copies of the ZIII element (ZIII-A and -B) bind to the BZLF1 protein. Previous studies have demonstrated that both ZI and ZII elements are necessary for the initial activation of the promoter by TPA/ionophore or anti-surface immunoglobulin IgG (2Amon W. Farrell P.J. Rev. Med. Virol. 2005; 15: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Then, the expressed BZLF1 protein further activates Zp by binding to ZIIIA and -B (9Flemington E. Speck S.H. J.

It has been reported that JDP2 recruits histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) to the promoters of target genes and inhibits histone acetyltransferase activity, thereby suppressing transcriptional activity (14Jin C.

Depending on the context and cell type, however, it can alternatively act as a transcriptional activator (25Wardell S.E. Boonyaratanakornkit V. Adelman J.S. Aronheim A. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell.

In the present study, we obtained evidence that JDP2 suppresses Zp mainly through interaction with the ZII cis-element. The lytic life cycle of the virus was found to be significantly enhanced by silencing of endogenous JDP2 expression. We also found that JDP2 supported recruitment of HDAC3 to Zp. These results indicate that JDP2 plays critical roles in regulation of the latent-lytic switch in EBV infection. HEK293T and EBV-BAC 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HEK293 cells with BZLF1 knock-out (BZLF1KO) EBV were prepared as described previously (27Murata T. Hotta N. Toyama S. Nakayama S. Chiba S. Isomura H. Ohshima T. Kanda T. Tsurumi T. J. Biol.

TPA and A23187 were added to induce lytic replication of EBV. Anti-human IgG (Dako Cytomation, A0423) was used for viral lytic induction in Akata cells, which were maintained in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Anti-JDP2 rabbit antiserum was a gift from Dr. A. Aronheim (The Rappaport Family Institute for Research in the Medical Sciences, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Israel). Anti-GAPDH, -HDAC3, and acetylated histone H3K9 antibodies were from Ambion, Abcam, and Active Motif, respectively. Both mouse and rabbit anti-FLAG antibodies were from Sigma.

Underlined nucleotides indicate the FLAG epitope. The amplified DNA was phosphorylated by polynucleotide kinase and then inserted into the EcoRV site of the pcDNA3 vector. The pCMV-RL reporter plasmid was obtained commercially (Stratagene). pCMV-FlagJDP2 was made by inserting human JDP2 cDNA into the NotI site of pCMV_S-FLAG (RIKEN, RDB 5956). A deletion mutant at the b-Zip domain of JDP2 was generated by PCR using primers 5′-CGCCCCACCTGCATCGTCC-3′ and 5′-TCGCTCCTCTTCCTCATCTAG-3′. Plasmid DNA was transfected into HEK293T or EBV-BAC 293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The total amounts of plasmid DNA were standardized by addition of an empty vector. Proteins were extracted from cells with the lysis buffer supplied in a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) kit and luciferase activities were measured using the kit. Akata cells were electronically transfected using a Microporator (Digital Bio). Protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies as described previously (29Murata T. Sato Y. Nakayama S. Kudoh A. Iwahori S. Isomura H. Tajima M.

FLAG-tagged JDP2 proteins were produced using the TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The probe was prepared by 3′-end labeling using Klenow fragment (TOYOBO) and [32P]dATP (Institute of Isotopes Co., Hungary). Unincorporated deoxynucleotide triphosphates were removed with Chromaspin-10 columns (Clontech). The in vitro translated protein and labeled DNA sequences were incubated in the EMSA binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 30 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml of poly(dI-dC)) at room temperature for 30 min. The samples were then separated in a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer and the radioactivities were visualized by using BAS2500 system (Fuji Film). The sequences of oligonucleotide probes were as follows: ZII, 5′-CCCAAACCATGACATCACAGAG-3′ and 5′-CTCCTCTGTGATGTCATGGTTTGGG-3′; ZIIIA, 5′-AACTATGCATGAGCCACAGG-3′ and 5′-ATGCCTGTGGCTCATGCATAGTT-3′; ZIIIB, 5′-CACAGGCATTGCTAATGT-3′ and 5′-GAGGTACATTAGCAATGCCTGTG-3′. Duplexes of a 21-nucleotide small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific to JDP2 mRNA, including two nucleotides of deoxythymidine at the 3′ end, were synthesized and annealed (Gene Design, Inc). The sense and antisense sequences of the duplex were 5′-GUGAGCUAGAUGAGGAAGAdTdT-3′ and 5′-UCUUCCUCAUCUAGCUCACdTdT-3′ (si-JDP2.1) and 5′-GCACAUACUCACCGAAUGUdTdT-3′ and 5′-ACAUUCGGUGAGUAUGUGCdTdT-3′ (si-JDP2.2), respectively. The control siRNA sequences were 5′-GCAGAGCUGGUUUAGUGAAdTdT-3′ and 5′-UUCACUAAACCAGCUCUGCdTdT-3′. Akata or B95-8 cells (1 × 105) were transfected with 50 pmol of the duplex RNA or with 300 ng of expression plasmid per well of a 24-well plate, using a Microporator (Digital Bio). 24 or 48 h after transfection, TPA plus A23187, or anti-IgG was added to induce lytic replication and incubated for another 12 or 24 h. Cells were then harvested for quantification by real time RT-PCR using the One-Step SYBR PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit II (TaKaRa). PCR was performed in 10 μl of solution containing 0.2 μm primers, 0.2 μl of ROX Dye, and the sample RNA in 1× One-Step SYBR RT-PCR buffer. Intensity of ROX Dye was used to compensate the volume fluctuations among the tubes. PCR included 5 min at 42 °C, 10 s at 95 °C, and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 5 s followed by 40 s at 60 °C. Immediately after the RT-PCR, we carried out dissociation curve analysis and confirmed the specificity of each PCR product. An arbitrary RNA was set to 1.0 and a standard curve was constructed using serial dilutions of RNA from the RNA set to 1.0. The amount of mRNA was quantitated based on the standard curve. Real time PCR with RNA polII primers was also performed to serve as an internal control for input RNA. Primers used for the real time RT-PCR were as follows: for JDP2 mRNA, 5′-CTGTGGAGGAGCTGAAATAC-3′ and 5′-ATCTAGCTCACTTTTCACGG-3′, for BZLF1 mRNA, 5′-AACAGCCAGAATCGCTGGAG-3′ and 5′-GGCACATCTGCTTCAACAGG-3′, for RNApolII 5′-GCACCACGTCCAATGACAT-3′ and 5′-GTGCGGCTGCTTCCATAA-3′. Viral DNA levels were assayed by dot-blot hybridization as described previously (28Murata T. Isomura H. Yamashita Y. Toyama S. Sato Y. Nakayama S. Kudoh A. Iwahori S. Kanda T. Tsurumi T.

Yamashita Y. Toyama S. Sato Y. Nakayama S. Kudoh A. Iwahori S. Kanda T. Tsurumi T. Virology. 2009; 389: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To prepare an mZII mutant of EBV-BAC, a transfer DNA fragment for the first recombination was generated by PCR using PpsL-neo (Gene Bridges) as the template, with the following primers: 5′-AGCCACAGGCATTGCTAATGTACCTCATAGACACACCTAAATTTAGCACGTCCCAAACCAGGCCTGGTGATGATGGCGGGATC-3′ and 5′-GAGTTACCTGTCTAACATCTCCCCTTTAAAGCCAAGGCACCAGCCTCCTCTGTGATGTCATCAGAAGAACTCGTCAAGAAGG-3′. After the recombination, kanamycin-resistant colonies were selected and checked to make intermediate DNA. The NeoSt+ cassette in the intermediate DNA was then replaced using the next transfer vector DNA, containing a mutation in the ZII cis-element of Zp. The transfer vector was made by PCR using pZpmZII-luc as the template with the following primers: 5′-ACCAGCTTATTTTAGACACTTC-3′ and 5′-GTTTGGGTCCATCATCTTCAG-3′. Streptomycin-resistant colonies were cloned and checked to make the EBV-BAC mZII mutant. Likewise, a revertant of the mZII mutant (EBV-BAC mZII/R) was created by re-insertion of the NeoSt+ cassette and its rescue using a wild-type BZLF1 promoter sequence. Electroporation of E. coli was performed using Gene Pulser III (Bio-Rad) and purification of EBV-BAC DNA was achieved with NucleoBond Bac100 (Macherey-Nagel). Recombination was confirmed with PCR products of the Zp region, electrophoresis of the BamHI-digested viral genome, and sequencing analysis. EBV-BAC DNA was transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), which were then cultured on 10-cm dishes with 100–150 μg/ml of hygromycin B for 10–15 days for cloning of GFP-positive cell colonies as described previously (28Murata T. Isomura H. Yamashita Y. Toyama S. Sato Y. Nakayama S. Kudoh A. Iwahori S. Kanda T. Tsurumi T. Virology. 2009; 389: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, for each recombinant virus, we picked up more than 10 hygromycin-resistant, GFP-positive cell colonies to obtain at least 3 typical clones exhibiting minimal spontaneous expression of viral lytic proteins and significant induction of these upon BZLF1 transfection. ChIP assays were performed essentially as described (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) with formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin from 1 × 106 cells for each reaction. Cells were lysed, and chromatin was sonicated to obtain DNA fragments with an average length of 300 bp. Following centrifugation, the chromatin was diluted 10-fold with ChIP dilution buffer, and precleared with protein A-agarose beads containing salmon sperm DNA (Upstate). Anti-FLAG antibody or normal rabbit IgG was added to the sample and incubation proceeded overnight with rotation. Immune complexes were then collected by addition of protein A-agarose beads and DNA was purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) after uncoupling of the cross-linking and proteinase K digestion. The recovered DNA was amplified by PCR using primers specific for Zp: 5′-TAGCCTCGAGGCCATGCATATTTCAACTGG-3′, 5′-GCCAAGCTTCAAGGTGCAATGTTTAGTGAG-3′, and for the EBNA1 open reading frame: 5′-GTCATCATCATCCGGGTCTC-3′ and 5′-TTCGGGTTGGAACCTCCTTG-3′. The PCR products were then analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium bromide. The samples were also subjected to real time PCR for quantification of DNA sequences using the same primers and SYBR Premix Ex TaqII (TaKaRa). Real time PCR was performed in 10 μl of solution containing 0.2 μm primers, 0.2 μl of ROX Dye, and the sample DNA in 1× One-Step SYBR RT-PCR buffer. Intensity of ROX Dye was used to compensate the volume fluctuations among the tubes. PCR included 10 s at 95 °C and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 5 s followed by 45 s at 60 °C. Immediately after the PCR, we carried out dissociation curve analysis and confirmed the specificity of each PCR product. An arbitrary DNA was set to 1.0 and a standard curve was constructed using serial dilutions of DNA from the DNA set to 1.0. The amount of DNA was quantitated based on the standard curve. For immunoprecipitation to detect the association between JDP2 and HDAC3, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture). After sonication and centrifugation, lysates were precleared with protein G-Sepharose, then mixed with anti-FLAG antibody and protein G-Sepharose for 4 h. The resin was washed 5 times with the same buffer and then samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-JDP2 or FLAG antibody. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was carried out using Student's t test and values considered significantly different when p < 0.05. Because JDP2 represses transcriptional activation of reporter constructs containing cAMP-response element or TPA-responsive elements (23Jin C. Ugai H. Song J. Murata T. Nili F. Sun K. Horikoshi M. Yokoyama K.K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that JDP2 might regulate the BZLF1 transcription and thereby affect EBV reactivation. To investigate this possibility, we first carried out reporter gene assays. Co-transfection of the JDP2 expression vector clearly repressed reporter gene expression from pZp-luc, in the presence or absence of BZLF1 (data not shown). In this reporter assay, however, we co-transfected pCMV-RL, a Renilla luciferase reporter driven by the CMV immediate early promoter at the same time, and this reporter strongly responded negatively, regardless of BZLF1 (data not shown). This result pointed to a possibility that ectopic overexpression of JDP2 suppresses the CMV immediate-early promoter, as well as BZLF1 promoter and that this system is not suitable for analyses of specific effects of JDP2 on the Zp. Therefore, we adopted siRNA technology, using synthetic oligonucleotides that form duplex RNA encoding partial nucleotides from JDP2. As shown in Fig. 1A, cotransfection with the BZLF1 expression vector (Z) caused increased Zp activity, due to its autoactivation ability. Treatment with an siRNA (si-JDP2.1) significantly elevated the transcriptional activity from the wild-type BZLF1 promoter (pZp-luc(wt)), either in the presence or absence of BZLF1 (Fig. 1A). Another siRNA (si-JDP2.2) also resulted in increased Zp activity (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, silencing of endogenous JDP2 did not affect the CMV promoter as monitored by the reporter assay (data not shown). On the other hand, when the ZII motif in the Zp was mutated (pZpmZII-luc), a significant response to JDP2 knockdown was not observed (Fig. 1A). Knockdown of the JDP2 protein was checked by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). Real time PCR analysis indicated that si-JDP2.1 and si-JDP2.2 reduced the JDP2 mRNA levels down to 23 and 43% of the control (data not shown). We also examined that levels of the BZLF1 protein were relatively constant (Fig. 1B). To quantify the levels of JDP2 knockdown, protein samples transfected with si-JDP2.1 or si-JDP2.2 were compared with those from control cells after serial dilution (Fig. 1C). Either of the siRNAs reduced the JDP2 protein levels to ∼30% or less in HEK293T cells. These results suggest that JDP2 inhibit Zp through the ZII cis-element, which is known to be bound by cellular transcription factors such as CREB/ATF/AP-1. The site-directed mutation of the ZIII element, which prevents BZLF1 binding, failed to respond to ectopic expression of the BZLF1 protein (Fig. 1D) as expected, but its promoter activity was increased by si-JDP2 treatment (Fig. 1D, pZpmZIII-luc). Although p values indicate that JDP2 knockdown did not always cause statistically significant augmentation of wild-type or mZIII promoters, these results imply that JDP2 decreases Zp activity and that the suppressive effect of JDP2 is mediated through the ZII motif, but not through the ZIII of BZLF1 promoter. Reporter assays suggested JDP2 association with the ZII element, but not with the ZIII elements. To confirm the binding of JDP2 to the ZII cis-element, EMSA was carried out in Fig. 2. Addition of FLAG-tagged JDP2 produced a specific band of JDP2-ZII complex (Fig. 2, lane 2). Excess amounts of unlabeled ZII competitor clearly reduced the intensities of the shifted band (lane 3), whereas the cold ZIIIA or ZIIIB did not (lanes 4 or 5, respectively). When JDP2 lacking b-Zip domain (FlagdJDP2, lane 8) was used instead of wild-type FlagJDP2 (lane 7), no obvious shift was detected (Fig. 2, right). Supershift analysis with anti-FLAG antibody demonstrated that the band actually contained FLAG-tagged JDP2 protein (lane 9). Therefore, JDP2 binds to ZII, but not to the ZIIIA or ZIIIB cis-elements of Zp. To further verify the reporter assays and EMSA results, we performed ChIP analysis using cells containing wild-type or BZLF1 knock-out (BZLF1KO) EBV-BAC (27Murata T. Hotta N. Toyama S. Nakayama S. Chiba S. Isomura H. Ohshima T. Kanda T. Tsurumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23925-23935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We used the BZLF1KO mutant strain, to exclude the possibility that BZLF1 is involved in the association between JDP2 and the BZLF1 promoter. The BZLF1 promoter region was obviously co-precipitated with FLAG-tagged JDP2 (supplemental Fig. S1A), either in wild-type or BZLF1KO. A primer set for the EBNA1 coding region was included as a negative control to prove that the signal for the Zp was specific. This experiment of BZLF1KO was repeated and quantified in Fig. 3. With wild-type JDP2, the Zp was significantly concentrated when compared to the level of dJDP2 (Fig. 3A). Thus, the association proved to be intact, indicating that BZLF1 is not needed for JDP2 binding to the BZLF1 promoter sequence. Because the above documented results indicated JDP2 acts to suppress the BZLF1 promoter by binding to the ZII cis-element, we generated recombinant EBV with a point mutation in the ZII element (Fig. 4A). To this end, we first replaced the ZII element with a marker cassette (NeoSt+), and then exchanged this with the mutated ZII sequence, to prepare EBV-BAC mZII. The mutated ZII sequence of the EBV was again swapped with a NeoSt+ cassette, followed by replacement with the wild-type sequence, to generate a revertant strain, EBV-BAC mZII/R. Sequencing analysis confirmed that the EBV-BAC mZII DNA had the same mutation as the pZpmZII-luc vector (Fig. 1), and that the EBV-BAC mZII/R had the same sequence as the wild-type virus, as intended. Integrity of the BAC DNA was checked by BamHI digestion followed by electrophoresis to confirm that the recombinant viruses did not carry obvious deletions or insertions (Fig. 4B). The BamHI-Z fragment was too short to be clearly detected. Recombinant EBV-BAC DNA was introduced into HEK293 cells, followed by hygromycin selection, to establish cell lines in which multiple copies were maintained as an episome. More than 10 cell colonies from each recombinant virus were obtained and viral protein expression levels were examined. Fig. 4C shows immunoblot"
https://openalex.org/W1978155358,"Face inversion produces a detrimental effect on face recognition. The extent to which the inversion of faces and other kinds of objects influences the perceptual binding of visual information into global forms is not known. We used a behavioral method and functional MRI (fMRI) to measure the effect of face inversion on visual persistence, a type of perceptual memory that reflects sustained awareness of global form. We found that upright faces persisted longer than inverted versions of the same images; we observed a similar effect of inversion on the persistence of animal stimuli. This effect of inversion on persistence was evident in sustained fMRI activity throughout the ventral visual hierarchy, including the lateral occipital area (LO), two face-selective visual areas--the fusiform face area (FFA) and the occipital face area (OFA)--and several early visual areas. V1 showed the same initial fMRI activation to upright and inverted forms but this activation lasted longer for upright stimuli. The inversion effect on persistence-related fMRI activity in V1 and other retinotopic visual areas demonstrates that higher-tier visual areas influence early visual processing via feedback. This feedback effect on figure-ground processing is sensitive to the orientation of the figure."
https://openalex.org/W2060492281,"The extracellular region of the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) can be subdivided into the leucine-rich repeat domain (LRRD) and the hinge region. Both the LRRD and the hinge region interact with thyrotropin (TSH) or autoantibodies. Structural data for the TSHR LRRD were previously determined by crystallization (amino acids Glu(30)-Thr(257), 10 repeats), but the structure of the hinge region is still undefined. Of note, the amino acid sequence (Trp(258)-Tyr(279)) following the crystallized LRRD comprises a pattern typical for leucine-rich repeats with conserved hydrophobic side chains stabilizing the repeat fold. Moreover, functional data for amino acids between the LRRD and the transmembrane domain were fragmentary. We therefore investigated systematically these TSHR regions by mutagenesis to reveal insights into their functional contribution and potential structural features. We found that mutations of conserved hydrophobic residues between Thr(257) and Tyr(279) cause TSHR misfold, which supports a structural fold of this peptide, probably as an additional leucine-rich repeat. Furthermore, we identified several new mutations of hydrophilic amino acids in the entire hinge region leading to partial TSHR inactivation, indicating that these positions are important for intramolecular signal transduction. In summary, we provide new information regarding the structural features and functionalities of extracellular TSHR regions. Based on these insights and in context with previous results, we suggest an extracellular activation mechanism that supports an intramolecular agonistic unit as a central switch for activating effects at the extracellular region toward the serpentine domain."
https://openalex.org/W2125398392,"Background Aß peptides are often considered as catabolic by-products of the amyloid ß protein precursor (APP), with unknown physiological functions. However, several biological properties have been tentatively attributed to these peptides, including a role in vasomotion. We assess whether plasma Aß peptide levels might be associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure values (SBP and DBP, respectively). Methodology/Principal Findings Plasma Aß1-40 and Aß1-42 levels were measured using an xMAP-based assay in 1,972 individuals (none of whom were taking antihypertensive drugs) from 3 independent studies: the French population-based 3C and MONA-LISA (Lille) studies (n = 627 and n = 769, respectively) and the Australian, longitudinal AIBL study (n = 576). In the combined sample, the Aß1-42/ Aß1-40 ratio was significantly and inversely associated with SBP (p = 0.03) and a similar trend was observed for DBP (p = 0.06). Using the median age (69) as a cut-off, the Aß1-42/Aß1-40 ratio was strongly associated with both SBP and DBP in elderly individuals (p = 0.002 and p = 0.03, respectively). Consistently, a high Aß1-42/ Aß1-40 ratio was associated with a lower risk of hypertension in both the combined whole sample (odds ratio [OR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-0.90) and (to an even greater extent) in the elderly subjects (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37–0.75). Lastly, all these associations appeared to be primarily driven by the level of plasma Aß1-40. Conclusion The plasma Aß1-42/Aß1-40 ratio is inversely associated with SBP, DBP and the risk of hypertension in elderly subjects, suggesting that Aß peptides affect blood pressure in vivo.

When environments improve, they must quickly resume growth to maximize their share of limited nutrients. Cells with higher stress resistance often survive longer stress durations at the cost of needing more time to resume growth, a strong disadvantage in competitive environments. Here we analyze the basis of optimal strategies that microorganisms can use to cope with this tradeoff. We explicitly show that the prototypical inverse relation between stress resistance and growth rate can explain much of the different types of behavior observed in stressed microbial populations. Using analytical mathematical methods, we determine the environmental parameters that decide whether cells should remain vegetative upon stress exposure, downregulate their metabolism to an intermediate optimum level, or become dormant. We find that cell-cell variability, or intercellular noise, is consistently beneficial in the presence of extreme environmental fluctuations, and that it provides an efficient population-level mechanism for adaption in a deteriorating environment. Our results reveal key novel aspects of responsive phenotype switching and its role as an adaptive strategy in changing environments."
https://openalex.org/W1964377512,"Genetic relationship of a newly discovered teosinte from Nicaragua, Zea nicaraguensis with waterlogging tolerance, was determined based on randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA using 14 accessions from Zea species. RAPD analysis showed that a total of 5,303 fragments were produced by 136 random decamer primers, of which 84.86% bands were polymorphic. RAPD-based UPGMA analysis demonstrated that the genus Zea can be divided into section Luxuriantes including Zea diploperennis, Zea luxurians, Zea perennis and Zea nicaraguensis, and section Zea including Zea mays ssp. mexicana, Zea mays ssp. parviglumis, Zea mays ssp. huehuetenangensis and Zea mays ssp. mays. ITS sequence analysis showed the lengths of the entire ITS region of the 14 taxa in Zea varied from 597 to 605 bp. The average GC content was 67.8%. In addition to the insertion/deletions, 78 variable sites were recorded in the total ITS region with 47 in ITS1, 5 in 5.8S, and 26 in ITS2. Sequences of these taxa were analyzed with neighbor-joining (NJ) and maximum parsimony (MP) methods to construct the phylogenetic trees, selecting Tripsacum dactyloides L. as the outgroup. The phylogenetic relationships of Zea species inferred from the ITS sequences are highly concordant with the RAPD evidence that resolved two major subgenus clades. Both RAPD and ITS sequence analyses indicate that Zea nicaraguensis is more closely related to Zea luxurians than the other teosintes and cultivated maize, which should be regarded as a section Luxuriantes species."
https://openalex.org/W2022005548,"The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Erk1/2 has been implicated to modulate the activity of nuclear receptors, including peroxisome proliferator activator receptors (PPARs) and liver X receptor, to alter the ability of cells to export cholesterol. Here, we investigated if the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk1/2 signaling cascade could affect reverse cholesterol transport via modulation of scavenger receptor class BI (SR-BI) levels. We demonstrate that in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, Mek1/2 inhibition reduces PPARα-inducible SR-BI protein expression and activity, as judged by reduced efflux onto high density lipoprotein (HDL). Ectopic expression of constitutively active H-Ras and Mek1 increases SR-BI protein levels, which correlates with elevated PPARα Ser-21 phosphorylation and increased cholesterol efflux. In contrast, SR-BI levels are insensitive to Mek1/2 inhibitors in PPARα-depleted cells. Most strikingly, Mek1/2 inhibition promotes SR-BI degradation in SR-BI-overexpressing CHO cells and human HuH7 hepatocytes, which is associated with reduced uptake of radiolabeled and 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyane-labeled HDL. Loss of Mek1/2 kinase activity reduces SR-BI expression in the presence of bafilomycin, an inhibitor of lysosomal degradation, indicating down-regulation of SR-BI via proteasomal pathways.

First, enhanced Erk1/2 signaling increases ABCA1 expression and ABCA1-mediated phospholipid efflux via up-regulation of PPARα levels in lung epithelial cells (26Agassandian M. Miakotina O.L. Andrews M. Mathur S.N. Mallampalli R.K. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Second, inhibition of Erk1/2 and activation of LXR synergistically induce macrophage ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux (27Zhou X. Yin Z. Guo X. Hajjar D.P. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 6316-6326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Third, Mek1/2 inhibition is involved in the regulation of PPARγ- and LXRβ-dependent ABCA1 protein degradation in HepG2 cells (28Mogilenko D.A. Shavva V.S. Dizhe E.B. Orlov S.V. Perevozchikov A.P.

These findings indicate that Erk1/2 kinases might exert opposite effects on nuclear receptor-inducible lipid transport depending on the cell type analyzed. SR-BI is another PPARα target gene that is up-regulated by PPARα agonists in human and mouse macrophages to promote HDL-inducible cholesterol efflux (29Chinetti G. Gbaguidi F.G. Griglio S. Mallat Z.

In this study, we show that MAPK inhibition down-regulates SR-BI in CHO and HEK293 cells treated with PPARα agonists, whereas enhanced Ras/MAPK activity increases PPARα Ser-21 phosphorylation and SR-BI expression levels, respectively. This correlates with MAPK inhibition reducing SR-BI activity, as judged by reduced cholesterol efflux onto HDL. Most relevant for the function of SR-BI in the liver, Ras/MAPK inhibition reduces SR-BI protein stability in HuH7 hepatocytes, which correlates with reduced uptake of [3H]cholesteryl ester and DiI-labeled HDL. Mek1/2 inhibition most likely promotes proteasomal degradation of SR-BI, whereas levels of the SR-BI adaptor PDZK1 remain unaffected. Thus, Erk kinases appear to target PPARα-dependent degradation pathways to regulate hepatic SR-BI protein stability.

https://openalex.org/W2086749907,"A methodology for inducing spawning in captivity of the lancelet Branchiostoma lanceolatum has been developed recently with animals collected at the Racou beach, in the southern coast of France. An increasing amount of laboratories around the world are now working on the evolution of developmental mechanisms (Evo-Devo) using amphioxus collected in this site. Thus, today, the development of new aquaculture techniques for keeping amphioxus in captivity is needed and the study of the natural conditions at which amphioxus is exposed in the Racou beach during their spawning season becomes necessary. We have investigated the amphioxus distribution, size frequency, and population structure in the Racou beach during its natural spawning season using multivariate methods (redundancy analysis and multiple regression). We found a clear preference of amphioxus for sandy sites, something that seems to be a general behaviour of different amphioxus species around the world. We have also estimated the amphioxus growth rate and we show how the animals are preferentially localized in shallow waters during April and June."

These are the cytoplasmic linker between the second and third transmembrane repeats (the II-III loop) of the α1S subunit of the skeletal dihydropyridine receptor (skDHPR), the β1a subunit of the DHPR, and the skeletal muscle type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1). It is generally accepted that membrane depolarization leads to the movement of charged residues in the fourth membrane-spanning helix (S4 segment) of the α1S subunit and that this “charge movement” causes a conformational change in the II-III loop, which is physically transmitted to the RyR1 channel, to open the ion channel and allow Ca2+ ion flow (1Dulhunty A.F.

However, in vitro structure and function studies of the II-III loop have thus far been performed with loop constructs expressed as a linear protein with free or untethered N- and C- terminal ends. Although the ends of the untethered loop are in close proximity in the three-dimensional structure (11Cui Y. Tae H.S. Norris N.C. Karunasekara Y. Pouliquin P. Board P.G. Dulhunty A.F. Casarotto M.G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 41: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the geometrical constraints are obviously very different from those experienced in the intact protein, where the N and C termini of the loop are “tethered” to the S6 helix of the second transmembrane repeat and the S1 helix of the third transmembrane repeat, respectively, both of which are inserted in the membrane of the transverse tubule extensions of the fiber surface.To more closely mimic the tethered nature of the II-III loop N and C termini in the intact membrane-bound protein and the in vivo situation, we have used an intein-based method to link the N- and C- terminal ends of the loop. Intein-mediated protein splicing is a post-translational reaction in which a precursor protein undergoes self-catalyzed head-to-tail intramolecular rearrangement with the consequent exclusion of an internal protein domain and the formation of a mature intein protein (12Derbyshire V.

Biochem. 2000; 69: 447-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Intein-mediated protein splicing has been used extensively in biotechnology in the purification of recombinant proteins, ligation of polypeptides, and the synthesis of protein microarrays, where it links the protein with a solid surface binding domain (14Perler F.B. IUBMB Life. 2005; 57: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Intein-mediated cyclization has also proved a useful tool for investigating the stability of native fold proteins (15Williams N.K. Liepinsh E. Watt S.J. Prosselkov P. Matthews J.M. Attard P. Beck J.L. Dixon N.E. Otting G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1095-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).In this study, we used the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 DnaB 429 amino acid intein protein to generate a split functional N- and C- terminal intein (16Wu H. Xu M.Q. Liu X.Q. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The terminal inteins come together to form a functional protein splicing domain that was engineered to contain the DHPR II-III loop. We found that tethering the ends of the II-III loop increased α-helical and β-strand structure in particular regions of the loop involved in key protein-protein interactions and EC coupling. This structural change strikingly increased the affinity of the II-III loop for the SPRY2 domain and enhanced its ability to activate RyR1 channels in lipid bilayers.DISCUSSIONUntil now, in vitro structural and functional investigations of the II-III loop fragment of the DHPR α1S subunit have been limited to a linear construct of this loop with untethered ends (8Stange M. Tripathy A. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1419-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 9Dulhunty A.F. Karunasekara Y. Curtis S.M. Harvey P.J. Board P.G.

However, the unrestrained ends of the loop are not a true representation of the physiological state, where the termini are anchored to membrane-spanning segments. We have used intein-mediated technology to effectively fuse the N and C termini of the loop with the aid of a linker peptide. We show for the first time that cyclization results in significant structural changes in several parts of the loop, including the critical region for EC coupling and in other regions essential for the in vitro function of the loop. Changes in the in vitro function of the protein were observed and were consistent with the structural changes.Functional Changes in the Cyclic II-III Loop Are Correlated with Structural ChangesIn vitro, the linear skeletal DHPR II-III loop is an activator of RyR1 (8Stange M.

The ability of the linear II-III loop to activate native skeletal RyR channels was clearly enhanced with the cyclic loop. We have previously demonstrated that the helical content of a peptide with a sequence corresponding to the A region of the II-III loop is inextricably linked to the peptide's ability to activate RyR1 channels (37Casarotto M.G.

This increased ability to activate the RyR1 channel is consistent with the stabilization of the helical components of the A and B regions.High Affinity Binding of the Cyclized Loop to the SPRY2 Domain of RyR1SPRY domains contribute to protein-protein interactions (39Rhodes D.A. de Bono B.

Because the A and B regions are major contributors to the increased α-helical content of the cyclized II-III loop, it is likely that this structural stabilization in the cyclized II-III loop is correlated with the 4-fold higher affinity for the SPRY2 domain. It is also likely that the tighter binding of the cyclized loop to the SPRY2 domain is linked to the enhanced activation of RyR1 channels. Thermodynamically, the increase in RyR1 binding and activity by the cyclic construct can be explained by a smaller entropic loss upon binding brought about by the stabilization of the helical interaction sites (A & B regions).Structural and Dynamic Changes with Cyclization of the LoopThe marked shift in the CD profile of the cyclized protein provides compelling evidence of a change in the structure of the II-III loop following cyclization. We have previously reported that the linear II-III loop is an intrinsically unstructured protein with at least two nascent helical elements located in the A and B regions (11Cui Y. Tae H.S. Norris N.C. Karunasekara Y. Pouliquin P. Board P.G. Dulhunty A.F. Casarotto M.G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 41: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The NMR 15N and 1H chemical shift data presented in Fig. 3a show that the most significant chemical shift changes occur not only in the N- and C-terminal residues adjacent to the linker residues but also in the regions adjacent to the directly modified region, such as the A (Glu666–Leu690) and B (Pro691–Glu724) regions of the loop. A more comprehensive chemical shift comparison using Cα and Cβ chemical shifts (Fig. 3b) showed not only an increase in helical structural propensity for this region but a marked increase in extended β-strand structural propensity for the C region.A series of three-dimensional NOESY-based NMR experiments revealed stable structural changes promoted by cyclization of the II-III loop. Notably, apart from new NOEs associated with the linker region, no discernable overall difference in the NOE profile between the linear and intein loop was evident. Close inspection of signature NOEs related to the α-helical secondary structure elements (A and B regions) and extended β-strand structure (C region) also showed a similar profile for the linear and intein loops. Therefore, cyclization does not promote alternative, stable structures within the II-III loop but rather results in subtle shifts in the equilibrium that exits between random coil and secondary structure elements. These subtle changes are detectable by spin-spin relaxation rate (R2) measurements, and the increased R2 values for the A/B helical and C regions are evidence of stabilization of the secondary structure elements within the intein protein. In summary, the CD and NMR data suggest that cyclization of the intrinsically unstructured DHPR II-III loop does not involve major structural modifications but instead induces subtle structural changes to the secondary structure elements of specific regions in the molecule and can dramatically influence the function of the protein.Functional and Physiological Implications of CyclizationIt is a generally held view that upon depolarization, movement of charged residues in the membrane-spanning segments of α1s DHPR is responsible for a conformational change in the II-III loop, which in turn is transmitted to the RyR1. We convincingly demonstrate by altering the geometry of the N- and C-terminal ends of the II-III loop that the structural and dynamic consequences are sensed throughout the entire loop. This observation has significant implications for EC coupling, where movement of charged residues in the S4 voltage sensor, by analogy with other voltage-gated cation channels, is likely to induce a major structural change in the membrane-spanning domains linked to the S4 segment (43Shrivastava I.H. Durell S.R. Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2255-2270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This structural reorientation of the S1 to S4 helices could dramatically alter the structural relationship between the N- and C-terminal ends of the II-III loop and alter the conformation of the II-III loop during EC coupling to either increase or decrease its structural content.Although the importance of the II-III loop in EC coupling and the critical region for EC coupling identified in the central C region (residues 720–765) has been long been established (44Nakai J. Tanabe T. Konno T. Adams B. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24983-24986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), knowledge of the interactive partners of the critical region within the loop in the coupling process is less clear. Concerted attempts by several groups to define the RyR1 binding partner for the critical C region have not been successful, suggesting either that the RyR1 binding partner is complex and remains elusive or that interactions of the C region may proceed through some intermediate protein/factor. In contrast, the in vitro binding between the A and B regions of the loop and the SPRY2 domain of RyR1 has been well characterized (11Cui Y. Tae H.S. Norris N.C. Karunasekara Y. Pouliquin P.

Indeed, an unpublished cryoelectron microscopy study of the location of the SPRY2 domain on the RyR1 has mapped this region on domain 6 of the RYR1. 6M. Samso, personal communication. Although this location is within contact distance with DHPR II-III loop, in vivo chimeric studies show that when the A region has been removed or disrupted, EC coupling is not significantly affected and thus is not critical (5Wilkens C.M.

It remains possible that, although not critical in a dysgenic myotube background, the II-III loop A region/SPRY2 interaction may play a supportive role in EC coupling, which may be revealed in transgenic animals in which a full range of muscle function can be explored. Such supportive roles have been found to be life-supporting in maintaining normal muscle function under stress in both skeletal muscle and the heart, in studies of other non-essential proteins, such as calsequestrin, triadin, and junctin (46Dainese M.

The A/B region of the loop interacts in vitro with the SPRY2 domain, and we demonstrated that a modest increase (∼13%) in helical content in this region of the loop was associated with a 3–4-fold increase in RyR1 channel activity and binding affinity. The most likely explanation for this increase is thermodynamic. The stabilized α-helical elements in the intein loop would be more favorably predisposed to interact with SPRY2 RyR1 binding sites. This finding is consistent with our previous findings that substituting strategic residues in the isolated A peptide (residues 671–690) led to the enhancement of its helical structure and subsequently its increased ability to activate RyR1 (37Casarotto M.G.

Because the interactive binding partner of the central C region of the II-III loop has yet to be established, it is not possible to perform a comparable structural and functional analysis for this region. It is possible that the changes in channel gating induced by cyclization are imposed by an interaction between the more structured C region and a binding partner in RyR1. However, the substantial increase in β-strand or extended structure found in the C region may allow the identification of new RyR1 binding partners using this improved construct.ConclusionWe find that cyclization of the skeletal DHPR II-III loop affects the secondary structure and the dynamic properties of the helical A/B region as well as the critical C region. These structural effects are correlated with a change in the in vitro activation profile of the RyR1 and with an interaction with DHPR II-III loop α-helical recognition sites in the SPRY2 domain of RyR1. The results provide a clear example of how subtle structural and dynamic changes in an intrinsically unstructured protein may affect molecular recognition. Also, the critical region of the loop that supports skeletal in vivo EC coupling demonstrated an increased β-strand or extended structure upon cyclization, indicating that this portion of the loop is susceptible to structural and dynamic changes, with functional consequences, induced by t-tubule membrane depolarization.

These are the cytoplasmic linker between the second and third transmembrane repeats (the II-III loop) of the α1S subunit of the skeletal dihydropyridine receptor (skDHPR), the β1a subunit of the DHPR, and the skeletal muscle type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1). It is generally accepted that membrane depolarization leads to the movement of charged residues in the fourth membrane-spanning helix (S4 segment) of the α1S subunit and that this “charge movement” causes a conformational change in the II-III loop, which is physically transmitted to the RyR1 channel, to open the ion channel and allow Ca2+ ion flow (1Dulhunty A.F.

Physical interactions between the II-III loop and RyR1 are also seen in in vitro studies, which reveal an increase in the activity of RyR1 channels when they are exposed to the recombinant DHPR II-III loop (7Meissner G.

However, in vitro structure and function studies of the II-III loop have thus far been performed with loop constructs expressed as a linear protein with free or untethered N- and C- terminal ends. Although the ends of the untethered loop are in close proximity in the three-dimensional structure (11Cui Y. Tae H.S. Norris N.C. Karunasekara Y. Pouliquin P. Board P.G. Dulhunty A.F. Casarotto M.G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 41: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the geometrical constraints are obviously very different from those experienced in the intact protein, where the N and C termini of the loop are “tethered” to the S6 helix of the second transmembrane repeat and the S1 helix of the third transmembrane repeat, respectively, both of which are inserted in the membrane of the transverse tubule extensions of the fiber surface.To more closely mimic the tethered nature of the II-III loop N and C termini in the intact membrane-bound protein and the in vivo situation, we have used an intein-based method to link the N- and C- terminal ends of the loop. Intein-mediated protein splicing is a post-translational reaction in which a precursor protein undergoes self-catalyzed head-to-tail intramolecular rearrangement with the consequent exclusion of an internal protein domain and the formation of a mature intein protein (12Derbyshire V.

Intein-mediated protein splicing has been used extensively in biotechnology in the purification of recombinant proteins, ligation of polypeptides, and the synthesis of protein microarrays, where it links the protein with a solid surface binding domain (14Perler F.B. IUBMB Life. 2005; 57: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Intein-mediated cyclization has also proved a useful tool for investigating the stability of native fold proteins (15Williams N.K. Liepinsh E. Watt S.J. Prosselkov P. Matthews J.M. Attard P.

Xu M.Q. Liu X.Q. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The terminal inteins come together to form a functional protein splicing domain that was engineered to contain the DHPR II-III loop. We found that tethering the ends of the II-III loop increased α-helical and β-strand structure in particular regions of the loop involved in key protein-protein interactions and EC coupling. This structural change strikingly increased the affinity of the II-III loop for the SPRY2 domain and enhanced its ability to activate RyR1 channels in lipid bilayers."
https://openalex.org/W2130766213,"Serum response factor (SRF) is an essential regulator of myogenic and neurogenic genes and the ubiquitously expressed immediate-early genes. The purpose of this study is to determine SRF expression pattern in murine pancreas and examine the role of SRF in pancreatic gene expression. Immunohistochemical analysis of wild-type pancreas and LacZ staining of pancreas from SRF LacZ knock-in animals showed that SRF expression is restricted to β cells. SRF bound to the rat insulin promoter II (RIP II) serum response element, an element conserved in both rat I and murine I and II insulin promoters. SRF activated RIP II, and SRF binding to RIP II and the exon 5-encoded 64-aa subdomain of SRF was required for this activation. Transient or stable knockdown of SRF leads to down-regulation of insulin gene expression, suggesting that SRF is required for insulin gene expression. Further, SRF physically interacted with the pancreas and duodenum homeobox-1 (Pdx-1) and synergistically activated RIP II. Elevated glucose concentration down-regulated SRF binding to RIP II SRE, and this down-regulation was associated with decreased RIP II activity and increased SRF phosphorylation on serine 103. Together, our results demonstrate that SRF is a glucose concentration-sensitive regulator of insulin gene expression.—Sarkar, A., Zhang, M., Liu, S.-H., Sarkar, S., Brunicardi, F. C., Berger, D.

https://openalex.org/W2072712622,"Neurons in the primary visual cortex, V1, are specialized for the processing of elemental features of the visual stimulus, such as orientation and spatial frequency. Recent fMRI evidence suggest that V1 neurons are also recruited in visual perceptual memory; a number of studies using multi-voxel pattern analysis have successfully decoded stimulus-specific information from V1 activity patterns during the delay phase in memory tasks. However, consistent fMRI signal modulations reflecting the memory process have not yet been demonstrated. Here, we report evidence, from three subjects, that the low V1 BOLD activity during retention of low-level visual features is caused by competing interactions between neural populations coding for different values along the spectrum of the dimension remembered. We applied a memory masking paradigm in which the memory representation of a masker stimulus interferes with a delayed spatial frequency discrimination task when its frequency differs from the discriminanda with ±1 octave and found that impaired behavioral performance due to masking is reflected in weaker V1 BOLD signals. This cross-channel inhibition in V1 only occurs with retinotopic overlap between the masker and the sample stimulus of the discrimination task. The results suggest that memory for spatial frequency is a local process in the retinotopically organized visual cortex."

D'Alessio A.C. Rodriguez-Suarez R.J. Senn A.M. Duek P.D. Wolosiuk R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Given their link with oxidative stress, most studies on 2-Cys Prxs have examined the H2O2-scavenging activity and the availability of electron donors (2Aran M. Ferrero D.S. Pagano E. Wolosiuk R.A. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 2478-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Even after the thermodynamic requirements for the removal of H2O2 are factored in, however, cellular components unable to transfer electrons may convey a kinetic advantage due to the allosteric control of catalytic activity. In this aspect, a plethora of studies have analyzed the redox control of non-redox reactions (20Chen C.Y. Willard D. Rudolph J. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 1399-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 21Kumsta C. Jakob U. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4666-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 22Mora-Garcia S. Stolowics F. Wolosiuk R.A. Plaxton W. McManus M. Control of Primary Metabolism in Plants. Vol. 22. Blackwell Publishing, Oxford, U.K2005: 150-186Plaxton W. McManus M. Annu. Plant Rev.Vol. 22. Blackwell Publishing, Oxford, U.K2005: 150-186Google Scholar), but detailed research on the regulation of redox processes via non-covalent interactions has proved elusive, perhaps simply because most of the conceptualizations on oxidative stress are built around redox transformations. We recently reported that ATP and Mg2+ (referred to hereafter as ATP/Mg) act both as substrate for autophosphorylation of the resolving cysteine CysR and as inhibitor of the peroxidase activity of chloroplast 2-Cys Prx (7Aran M. Caporaletti D. Senn A.M. Tellez de Iñon M.T. Girotti M.R. Llera A.S. Wolosiuk R.A. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 1450-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This dual capacity of ATP/Mg certainly warrants further examination because the nucleotide may convey the information needed for the response of 2-Cys Prx to non-redox stimuli. We found that low concentrations of ATP strongly favor the conversion of oxidized decamers into large soluble oligomers, which proceed to amorphous precipitates at higher concentrations of the nucleotide (≥5 mm). In this context, the term “oligomerization” refers to different non-covalent associations wherein 2-Cys Prx remains operationally soluble, whereas “aggregation” applies to the formation of precipitates. Significantly, both soluble oligomers and insoluble aggregates can be brought back to decamers by lowering the concentration of ATP or chelating Mg2+. We further demonstrate that (i) ATP/Mg predispose oxidized 2-Cys Prx to self-polymerization by increasing the abundance of β-structures and concurrently lowering the content of α-helices, and (ii) the substitution of essential residues for peroxidase activity promotes different responses in the ability to aggregate and to act as a chaperone. These findings reveal that ATP and Mg2+, two components devoid of redox activity and located in multiple cellular compartments, can modulate reversibly the assembly of 2-Cys Prx (decamers ⇔ soluble oligomers ⇔ insoluble aggregates). Hence, switching between different quaternary structures may be viewed as a mechanism that links the non-redox chemistry of the cell to the archetypical redox signaling module that is regulated through cysteine modifications. Biochemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The pET-22b(+) vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) was used to express the variants of 2-Cys Prx as C-terminal hexahistidine-tagged fusion proteins in JM109 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by the megaprimer method with primers described in supplemental Table S1. Recombinant chloroplast rapeseed 2-Cys Prx was prepared as described previously (18Caporaletti D. D'Alessio A.C. Rodriguez-Suarez R.J. Senn A.M. Duek P.D. Wolosiuk R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 355: 722-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, JM109 (DE3) E. coli cells harboring 2-Cys Prx expression plasmids were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. After induction with 0.6 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (3,000 × g, 10 min), washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), resuspended in the same buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, and subjected to sonication. After centrifugation (20,000 × g, 30 min), the supernatant fraction was loaded on a Ni2+-iminodiacetate-Sepharose column that was washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing successively 60 and 600 mm imidazole. The protein fraction released in the latter elution was dialyzed against and stored in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The purified chloroplast 2-Cys Prx exhibited a single band of 46 and 23 kDa in non-reducing and reducing SDS-PAGE, respectively (18Caporaletti D. D'Alessio A.C. Rodriguez-Suarez R.J. Senn A.M. Duek P.D. Wolosiuk R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 355: 722-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A molar extinction coefficient of 23,555 m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm was used to quantitate the homogeneous preparation of the recombinant protein. Recombinant chloroplast rapeseed Trx-m was prepared as reported previously (18Caporaletti D. D'Alessio A.C. Rodriguez-Suarez R.J. Senn A.M. Duek P.D. Wolosiuk R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 355: 722-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The peroxidase activity was assayed at 25 °C as described previously (7Aran M. Caporaletti D. Senn A.M. Tellez de Iñon M.T. Girotti M.R. Llera A.S. Wolosiuk R.A. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 1450-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The chaperone activity of 2-Cys Prx was measured using bovine pancreas insulin as substrate. To this end, 2-Cys Prx (8–18 μm) was incubated at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8) containing 0.5 mg/ml insulin. After 5 min, dithiothreitol was added (20 mm), and the aggregation of insulin β-chain was followed at 25 °C by monitoring optical density at 600 nm. Fluorescence studies with ANS were performed at 25 °C in solutions of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8) containing 10 μm 2-Cys Prx, 75 μm ANS (∈350 nm = 5,000 m−1 cm−1), 2 mm MgCl2, and appropriate concentrations of ATP (0–5 mm). After 10 min, the samples were excited at 370 nm, and emission spectra were scanned from 400 to 600 nm (bandwidth 5 nm). Reported spectra were averaged over four scans taken at 90° relative to the direction of the incident beam. All measurements were corrected for both buffer and non-bound ANS. The spectral center of mass, CM, was calculated using the following equation,CM=∑i=1Nmi∑i=1NmiyiEq. 1 where mi is the emission intensity at the yi wavelength and N is the spectrum range (23Silva J.L. Miles E.W. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5780-5786Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Solutions of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8) containing 5 μm 2-Cys Prx were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. Insoluble debris was removed, and MgCl2 (3 mm) containing appropriate concentrations of ATP (0–5 mm) were added to the supernatant fraction. DLS measurements were performed at 25 ± 0.1 °C using non-invasive back scatter equipment (Malvern Nano S, Malvern, UK) with a constant 173° scattering angle (sample volume 0.5 ml). A total of 25 scans (10 repetitions each) with an individual duration of ∼2.4 min were obtained for each sample. Scattering intensities were analyzed using the instrument software for the calculation of hydrodynamic diameter (DH), size, and volume distribution. The measurement of the molecular mass of 2-Cys Prx was carried out at 25 °C on a Precision Detector PD2010 light-scattering instrument connected in tandem to a Sephadex G-50 column and an LKB 2142 differential refractometer. 2-Cys Prx (43 μm) was incubated for 5 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) in the presence and in the absence of 3 mm ATP and 3 mm MgCl2. The protein was loaded on the Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated with the incubation solution and eluted with the same solution. The 90° light scattering and refractive index signals of the eluting material were analyzed with the Discovery32 software supplied by the manufacturer. Molecular masses were determined from the values of light scattering and refractive index using the model of Rayleigh-Debye-Gans for dilute polymer solutions. 2-Cys Prx (1–15 μm) was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min in 0.4 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8) containing appropriate perturbants. The aggregation of the protein was started by the addition of both ATP and MgCl2 and followed by monitoring the optical density at 600 nm in a Hitachi 220A dual beam spectrophotometer or by analysis of the supernatant and precipitate fractions on non-reducing SDS-PAGE. The aggregation of 2-Cys Prx mediated by ATP/Mg was carried out on an IAsys instrument (NeoSensors Ltd., Durham, UK), using standard carboxymethyl-dextran chips where neither 2-Cys Prx nor ATP was covalently attached to the surface of the cuvette. For base-line stabilization, the cuvette was washed several times with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8) until the resonant angle response was constant. The instrument parameters were set at 100% for stirring and 0.3 s for the sampling interval, and all measurements were performed at 25 °C. To estimate the association parameters, 4.2 μm 2-Cys Prx, 3 mm MgCl2, and appropriate concentrations of ATP were sequentially added. After every analysis, the cuvette surface was regenerated by washing three times with 4 m KOH (100 μl each) followed by several times with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8). The apparent association (ka), dissociation (kd), and equilibrium (KD = kd/ka) constants were obtained from the linear regression plot (kon = ka × [ATP] − kd) using the FAST plot program. Alternatively, kd was estimated by adding 10 mm EDTA to the cuvette after the association signal remained constant. 2-Cys Prx (0.1 mg/ml) was incubated at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8) and 3 mm MgCl2, in the presence or in the absence of 3 mm ATP. After 5 min, an aliquot (20 μl) was disseminated onto a carbon-coated copper grid (mesh 300, Ted Pella, Redding, CA), the excess of solution was gently removed using filter paper, and the grid was air-dried for 1 min. The protein was negatively stained with 0.5% uranyl acetate (pH 4.5) for 1 min. The grid was air-dried, and samples were examined under a transmission electron microscope (Philips EM 301). Particle dimensions were estimated using ImageJ. At least three independent experiments were performed for each treatment of 2-Cys Prx. UV-mediated binding of ATP to 2-Cys Prx was carried out as described previously (24Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 351-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein (10 μm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8) containing 5 mm MgC12 and appropriate concentrations of ATP was irradiated at 25 °C with a 15-watt germicidal lamp (total volume 0.2 ml). After 35 min, the solution was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8). CD spectra of 2-Cys Prx (2 μm) in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8) were measured at 20 °C with a quartz microcuvette (light path 0.2 cm) placed in a J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a thermoelectric temperature controller (Jasco, Easton, MD). Spectra were collected at 0.5 nm resolution and a scan rate of 200 nm/min, using at least two different preparations of freshly prepared protein solutions. Reported spectra were averaged over four scans. Ellipticities of CD spectra were analyzed with the software package CDPro, and the outputs of SELCON3, CONTINLL, and CDSSTR programs were averaged to quantitate the percentage of secondary structure of each spectrum. ANS is a fluorescent probe that interacts with solvent-accessible non-polar regions of partially folded proteins, which would be relatively rare in the native state (25Semisotnov G.V. Rodionova N.A. Razgulyaev O.I. Uversky V.N. Gripas' A.F. Gilmanshin R.I. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar, 26Ptitsyn O.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 83-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ANS binds to chloroplast 2-Cys Prx, causing a marked blue shift in the emission maximum wavelength (512 nm → 497 nm) and concurrently increasing the intensity of the fluorophore (7Aran M. Caporaletti D. Senn A.M. Tellez de Iñon M.T. Girotti M.R. Llera A.S. Wolosiuk R.A. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 1450-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A illustrates that the emission spectra of ANS exhibited modifications of the center of mass and intensity upon the incorporation of ATP in the presence of 2 mm Mg2+. As illustrated in Fig. 1B, the response of the center of mass to increasing concentrations of ATP showed three well defined stages: (i) a significant blue shift (497 nm → 492 nm) at concentrations lower than 0.5 mm, (ii) a stabilization at 492 nm from 0.5 to 2 mm, and (iii) a second blue shift (492 nm → 489 nm) between 2 and 5 mm. Notably, these transitions of fluorescence emulated the ATP/Mg-mediated inhibition of the peroxidase activity reported previously (cf. Fig. 1 in Ref. 7Aran M. Caporaletti D. Senn A.M. Tellez de Iñon M.T. Girotti M.R. Llera A.S. Wolosiuk R.A. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 1450-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Taken together, the ATP-induced transitions appear to be related to changes in the tertiary structure and/or the self-association of 2-Cys Prx, which, in turn, drag the protein to populate states with more exposed hydrophobic regions. The interaction with ATP/Mg did not imply changes in the chemical state of the nucleotide because we found that neither ADP nor phosphate is incorporated to the protein or released to the surrounding milieu. The weight average molar mass of native 2-Cys Prx was 230 kDa in SLS experiments but the major species corresponded to a weight average molar mass of 46 kDa when estimated by gel filtration or non-reducing SDS-PAGE. In line with previous studies, these results confirmed that covalently linked homodimers of 2-Cys Prx have a tendency to associate non-covalently into decamers (27Hirotsu S. Abe Y. Okada K. Nagahara N. Hori H. Nishino T. Hakoshima T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 12333-12338Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 28Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Hantgan R.R. Karplus P.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5493-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 29Alphey M.S. Bond C.S. Tetaud E. Fairlamb A.H. Hunter W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 903-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Moreover, SLS experiments showed that the weight average molar mass of 2-Cys Prx increased from 230 kDa to 2.2 MDa upon the addition of 3 mm ATP/Mg, but it returned immediately to the former value when ATP was removed by gel filtration (not shown). Given the fast interconversion between 2-Cys Prx decamers and large oligomers, we turned to DLS for studying the self-polymerization in real time. In the presence of 3 mm Mg2+, the particle size distribution of 2-Cys Prx showed a homogeneous population centered at a DH of 13 nm that remained invariable during the assay (Fig. 2A). This size was in line with the values obtained from structures of 2-Cys Prx decamers from different organisms (15Schröder E. Littlechild J.A. Lebedev A.A. Errington N. Vagin A.A. Isupov M.N. Structure. 2000; 8: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 28Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Hantgan R.R. Karplus P.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5493-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). When 4 mm ATP was added, the peak maximum shifted slowly to different species that approached a maximum of 40 nm in 30 min (Fig. 2B). This irregular time-dependent size distribution revealed that ATP/Mg induced the emergence of new oligomeric species from the monodisperse population of decamers. Two complementary experiments further indicated that the ATP/Mg-mediated oligomerization was an important feature of typical 2-Cys Prx. First, the E. coli homolog AhpC exhibited similar variations in the profile of DH upon the addition of 4 mm ATP/Mg (not shown). Second, ATP/Mg did not modify the DH of chloroplast Trx-m (4.2 nm), a monomeric protein that, like typical 2-Cys Prx, exhibits the Trx fold (supplemental Fig. S1) (30Duek P.D. Wolosiuk R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1546: 299-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 31Atkinson H.J. Babbitt P.C. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5: e1000541Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). At this stage, we asked whether ATP/Mg drive 2-Cys Prx to the formation of irreversible or reversible oligomers in solution. The former process is often associated with modifications that denature proteins, whereas the latter is ascribed to self-associations that generally contribute to regulatory functions. The almost instantaneous dissociation of the large oligomers to initial decamers by the addition of EDTA demonstrated the reversibility of the process (Fig. 2C). Although we were able to trap oligomers that accumulate in solution when 2-Cys Prx was incubated with low concentrations of ATP, large supramolecular assemblies appeared beyond 4 mm (Fig. 2D). These novel species originated from the decameric form were far larger than most previous reports of soluble 2-Cys Prx oligomers (Fig. 2E is the enlarged boxed section of Fig. 2D). DLS experiments do not convey information on the shapes of particles. Therefore, TEM analyses were performed to assess the dependence of protein morphology on the binding of ATP/Mg. In the absence of ligands, proteins appear as ring-shaped structures with an average external diameter of 13 nm and an internal diameter of 6 nm (Fig. 3A), consistent with the decameric toroids observed in counterparts from other species (9Jang H.H. Lee K.O. Chi Y.H. Jung B.G. Park S.K. Park J.H. Lee J.R. Lee S.S. Moon J.C. Yun J.W. Choi Y.O. Kim W.Y. Kang J.S. Cheong G.W. Yun D.J. Rhee S.G. Cho M.J. Lee S.Y.

Meissner U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1547: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast to these regular morphologies, treatment with 3 mm ATP/Mg (Fig. 3B) produced large ball-like particles with an average diameter of ∼30 nm. Most of the spheres exhibited irregular surfaces that contained small discernible substructures, suggesting a residual heterogeneity within each class. Overall, TEM corroborated that the binding of ATP/Mg triggered the formation of oligomers whose quaternary structures were markedly different from the ring-shaped forms observed in the absence of ATP. To further unravel the structural changes that promote the modification of the quaternary structure, we relied on far-UV CD spectroscopy to study the action of ligands on the elements of secondary structure. Although the approach was conceptually straightforward, the high extinction coefficient of ATP in the far-UV region precluded the direct use of CD spectroscopy due to a high noise/signal ratio. If the non-covalent binding of ATP to 2-Cys Prx has an effect upon the structure, the immobilization of the nucleotide through covalent binding should mimic the conformational change. We therefore used the method of photoaffinity labeling, which enabled the covalent binding of the nucleotide to regions of the protein in close contact with the adenine ring (34Kierdaszuk B. Eriksson S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4952-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).
