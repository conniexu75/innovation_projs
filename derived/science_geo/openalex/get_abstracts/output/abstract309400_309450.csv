https://openalex.org/W2080977433,"Two surface samples collected from the Chryse Planitia region of Mars were heated to temperatures up to 500 degrees C, and the volatiles that they evolved were analyzed with a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer. Only water and carbon dioxide were detected. This implies that organic compounds have not accumulated to the extent that individual components could be detected at levels of a few parts in 10(9) by weight in our samples. Proposed mechanisms for the accumulation and destruction of organic compounds are discussed in the light of this limit."
https://openalex.org/W1983297922,"Models are presented for the past history of nitrogen on Mars based on Viking measurements showing that the atmosphere is enriched in (15)N. The enrichment is attributed to selective escape, with fast atoms formed in the exosphere by electron impact dissociation of N(2) and by dissociative recombination of N(2)(+). The initial partial pressure of N(2) should have been at least as large as several millibars and could have been as large as 30 millibars if surface processes were to represent an important sink for atmospheric HNO(2) and HNO(3)."
https://openalex.org/W1999536110,"Three different types of biological experiments on samples of martian surface material (""soil"") were conducted inside the Viking lander. In the carbon assimilation or pyrolytic release experiment, (14)CO(2) and (14)CO were exposed to soil in the presence of light. A small amount of gas was found to be converted into organic material. Heat treatment of a duplicate sample prevented such conversion. In the gas exchange experiment, soil was first humidified (exposed to water vapor) for 6 sols and then wet with a complex aqueous solution of metabolites. The gas above the soil was monitored by gas chromatography. A substantial amount of O(2) was detected in the first chromatogram taken 2.8 hours after humidification. Subsequent analyses revealed that significant increases in CO(2) and only small changes in N(2) had also occurred. In the labeled release experiment, soil was moistened with a solution containing several (14)C-labeled organic compounds. A substantial evolution of radioactive gas was registered but did not occur with a duplicate heat-treated sample. Alternative chemical and biological interpretations are possible for these preliminary data. The experiments are still in process, and these results so far do not allow a decision regarding the existence of life on the plonet Mars."
https://openalex.org/W2073013840,"Results from the neutral mass spectrometer carried on the aeroshell of Viking 1 show evidence for NO in the upper atmosphere of Mars and indicate that the isotopic composition of carbon and oxygen is similar to that of Earth. Mars is enriched in (15)N relative to Earth by about 75 percent, a consequence of escape that implies an initial abundance of nitrogen equivalent to a partial pressure of at least 2 millibars. The initial abundance of oxygen present either as CO(2) or H(2)O must be equivalent to an exchangeable atmospheric pressure of at least 2 bars in order to inhibit escape-related enrichment of (18)O."
https://openalex.org/W1969780980,Drifts of fine-grained sediment are present in the vicinity of the Viking 1 lander. Many drifts occur in the lees of large boulders. Morphologic analysis indicates that the last dynamic event was one of general deflation for at least some drifts. Particle cohesion implies that there is a distinct small-particle upturn in the threshold velocity-particle size curve; the apparent absence of the most easily moved particles (150 micrometers in diameter) may be due to their preferential transport to other regions or their preferential collisional destruction. A twilight rescan with lander cameras indicates a substantial amount of red dust with mean radius on the order of 1 micrometer in the atmosphere.
https://openalex.org/W2062579856,"Several new analyses of the martian atmosphere have been carried out with the mass spectrometer in the molecular analysis experiment. The ratios of abundant isotopes of carbon and oxygen are within 10 percent of terrestrial values, whereas nitrogen-15 is considerably enriched on Mars. We have detected argon-38 and set new limits on abundances of krypton and xenon. The limit on krypton is sufficiently low to suggest that the inventories of volatile substances on Mars and on Earth may be distinctly different."
https://openalex.org/W1967496677,"The location of the Viking 1 lander is most ideal for the study of soil properties because it has one footpad in soft material and one on hard material. As each soil sample was acquired, information on soil properties was obtained. Although analysis is still under way, early results on bulk density, particle size, angle of internal friction, cohesion, adhesion, and penetration resistance of the soil of Mars are presented."
https://openalex.org/W1994736536,"The results from the meteorology instruments on the Viking 1 lander are presented for the first 20 sols of operation. The daily patterns of temperature, wind, and pressure have been highly consistent during the period. Hence, these have been assembled into 20-sol composites and analyzed harmonically. Maximum temperature was 241.8 degrees K and minimum 187.2 degrees K. The composite wind vector has a mean diurnal magnitude of 2.4 meters per second with prevailing wind from the south and counterclockwise diurnal rotation. Pressure exhibits diurnal and semidiurnal oscillations. The diurnal is ascribed to a combination of effects, and the semidiurnal appears to be the solar semidiurnal tide. Similarities to Earth are discussed. A major finding is a continual secular decrease in diurnal mean pressure. This is ascribed to carbon dioxide deposition at the south polar cap."
https://openalex.org/W2008901430,"The search for the landing site of Viking 2 was more extensive than the search for the Viking 1 site. Seven times as much area (4.5 million square kilometers) was examined as for Viking 1. Cydonia (B1) and Capri (C1) sites were examined with the Viking 1 orbiter. The B latitude band (40 degrees to 50 degrees N) was selected before the final midcourse maneuver of Viking 2 because of its high scientific interest (that is, high atmospheric water content, surface temperature, possible near-surface permafrost, and a different geological domain). The Viking 1 orbiter continued photographing the Cydonia (B1) site to search for an area large and smooth enough on which to land (three-sigma ellipse; 100 by 260 kilometers); such an area was not found. The second spacecraft photographed and made infrared measurements in large areas in Arcadia (B2) and Utopia Planitia (B3). Both areas are highly textured, mottled cratered plains with abundant impact craters like Cydonia (B1), but smaller sectors in each area are partially mantled by wind-formed deposits. The thermal inertia, from which the grain size of surface material can be computed, and atmospheric water content were determined from the infrared observations. A region in Utopia Planitia, west of the crater Mie, was selected: the landing took place successfully on 3 September 1976 at 3:58:20 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time, earth received time."
https://openalex.org/W2093491099,"Iron, calcium, aluminum, silicon, and sulfur are major elements in the first surface sample of Mars that has been analyzed by the Viking x-ray fluorescence spectrometer. Titanium is present in minor quantities. This is consistent with the sample being a mixture of fine silicate and oxide mineral grains, with a significant proportion of sulfates, possibly hydrated. Ferric oxide is regarded as the red pigmenting agent on the martian surface, but if it coats silicate grains, the coatings must be very thin (</= 2 micrometers) or discontinuous. A high abundance of Fe, relatively low abundances of Al, Rb, Sr, and Zr, and a high Ca/K ratio are distinctive features of the spectra. Preliminary determinations indicate the following abundances (as percentages by weight): Fe, 14 +/- 2; Ti < 1; S, 2 to 5; the Ca/K ratio by weight is greater than 5."
https://openalex.org/W1967351587,"High sanidine, (K,Na)AlSi(3)O(8), transforms reversibly to a triclinic phase at high pressure. This is analogous to the high-temperature monalbite transformation. Disordered alkali feldspars of various compositions have unit-cell dimensions which are very similar at the transition (a = 8.30 A, b = 12.97 A, c = 7.14 A, and beta = 116.2 degrees ), indicating that the transformation is structurally controlled. Changes in temperature, pressure, and the sodium/potassium ratio cause similar structural variations: angles between adjacent, rigid tetrahedra vary to accommodate changing effective alkali cation sizes."
https://openalex.org/W2052734287,"Spectroscopic measurements of the thermal radiation from Jupiter between 12 and 24 micrometers (420 to 840 reciprocal centimeters) with a resolution of 4 reciprocal centimeters are used to infer the Jovian temperature structure in the pressure region 0.1 to 0.4 atmosphere. The brightness temperature spectrum is in good agreement with previous ground-based measurements between 11 and 13 micrometers and with airborne measurements between 18 and 25 micrometers. However, the integrated flux calculated for a filter window and viewing angle equivalent to those of the 20 micrometer channel of Pioneer 10 is 20 percent below that measured by the Pioneer infrared radiometer. The Q branch of the v(5) fundamental band of acetylene at 730 reciprocal centimeters appears in emission and leads to a mixing ratio estimate of 10(-6 +/- 0.5)."

https://openalex.org/W1985797308,"Three permanent magnet arrays are aboard the Viking lander. By sol 35, one array, fixed on a photometric reference test chart on top of the lander, has clearly attracted magnetic particles from airborne dust; two other magnet arrays, one strong and one weak, incorporated in the backhoe of the surface sampler, have both extracted considerable magnetic mineral from the surface as a result of nine insertions associated with sample acquisition. The loose martian surface material around the landing site is judged to contain 3 to 7 percent highly magnetic mineral which, pending spectrophotometric study, is thought to be mainly magnetite."
https://openalex.org/W2072439932,"A chronology of Viking 1 lander activities is presented for the first 43 sols (Martian days) of surface sampling and analysis. The orbital insertion of the second Viking spacecraft is reviewed along with the search for the second landing site. A general assessment of the planet is made on the basis of the data thus far obtained. Some of the findings reported are that: (1) there is extensive evidence of volcanism, fluvial and aeolian erosion, and deposition over the entire surface; (2) the floor of Vallis Marineris is significantly younger than the planet's surface; (3) the morphology of Martian crater ejecta is indicative of surface flow rather than ballistic deposition; (4) the rocks in the immediate vicinity of the lander are all covered by a layer of fine red dust; (5) the atmosphere is optically thick and well mixed, with suspended particles giving the sky a pink color; (6) the N and Ar isotopic ratios are different from those on earth; (7) atmospheric water vapor varies with both time of day and location; (8) the summer northern polar regions have a high water concentration in the atmosphere; (9) a large fraction of magnetic material resides in the surface; and (10) no complex organic compounds have been detected in the two samples analyzed."

https://openalex.org/W2020928676,Color reconstruction and ratios of orbital images of Mars confirm Earth-based measurements showing red/violet ratios for bright areas to be roughly 1.5 times greater than dark areas. The new results show complex variation among dark materials; dark streaks emanating from craters in southern cratered terrains are much bluer than dark materials of the north equatorial plains on which Viking 1 landed.
