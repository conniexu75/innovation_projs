https://openalex.org/W1984063991,"Male white-crowned sparrows have song ""dialects,"" acquired in about the first 100 days of life by learning from older males. In the laboratory an alien white-crowned sparrow dialect can be taught. Once the song is established further acoustical experience does not change the pattern. White-crowned sparrows do not copy recorded songs of other sparrow species presented under similar conditions."

In extracts of rat liver, the drugs inhibit transfer of amino acid from soluble RNA to polypeptide. Unlike puromycin, these drugs do not accelerate release of nascent polypeptide chains. The drugs have no effect on protein synthesis in extracts of Escherichia coli."

Freshly harvested cells were similar to whole bone segments in aerobic glucose metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2053650256,"Intravenous injection into rabbits of endotoxin or killed cells of Escherichia coli induced, in 1 hour, a viral inhibitor detectable in serum. The inhibitor disappeared from the serum in 7 to 24 hours, and was only active after incubation with rabbit cell cultures. Like interferon, it did not preferentially inactivate virus directly, was ineffective in chick cells, was inactivated by trypsin, and was not sedimentable. Unlike interferon, the inhibitor was heat labile. Nucleic acid or nucleotides apparently play no role in its induction."
https://openalex.org/W2035312363,"Since a change of stimulus is required to effect a visual response, and since saccadic eye movements change the locus of the retinal image, the hypothesis was developed that there should be a brain response following saccadic eye movement.- The hypothesis was tested experimentally by averaging the activities following successive saccadic eye movements. A response was found whose characteristics were dependent on illuminance of the stimulus."

https://openalex.org/W2083922170,"The concentrations of a large number of compounds of biological interest which would be present in the atmosphere at thermodynamic equilibrium were computed under many combinations of temperature, pressure, and elemental composition. These computations revealed a possible mechanism for the abiological formation of asphaltic tar and an oxidative threshold at which all but the simplest compounds disappear."
https://openalex.org/W2077063424,The DNA-agar technique for homology studies was used to investigate of the viral genetic material. Complemetary found between the polyoma DNA and the DNA of several mammalian species. The increased complementarity of the polyoma DNA to the DNA of polyoma-induced tumor reflects an increased frequency of common poly-nucleotide sequences in the tumor DNA.

https://openalex.org/W2069160752,"N(4)-benzyladenine, an active phytokinin, inhibits the respiration of many explants. The chemnical also delays senescence and extends the postharvest life of many green or leafy vegetables. Evidence is presented that these phenomena may be linked to a comnpetitive inhibition of the glycolytic kinases by N(4)-benzyladenine."

https://openalex.org/W1992881157,"Aldrin, p,p'-DDT, dieldrin, gamma chlordane. heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, J-hydroxychlordene, and lindane were bioassayed against larvae of Anopheles quadrimaculatus Say; the remnant amounts of insecticide and metabolites in larvae and medium were determined by electron-affinity gas chromatography. The insecticides were surprisingly nonpersistent at concentrations normally used."

https://openalex.org/W1992465496,Rabbit blood cells incubated in vitro with purified parainfluenza-5 virus (DA strain) released a rapidly acting pyrogen. Spleen and lymph node cells were inactive. The pyrogen resembled in behavior a pyrogen extracted from granulocytic exudates. Similar cells in the blood are believed to be activated by virus in vivo to produce the circulating endogenous pyrogen that mediates virus-induced fever.
https://openalex.org/W2002984746,"Lowering the mechanical threshold and, independently, prolonging the duration of the action potential cause an increased rate of tension development, as well as potentiation of the twitch, of frog skeletal muscle. The alterations of the two different features of function of the action potential modify excitation-contraction coupling in essentially identical fashion (probably by increasing the liberation of free Ca(2+) into the myoplasm), and this results in early intensification as well as later prolongation of the active state."

https://openalex.org/W1969279020,"IN investigating short-term memory (a term generally used to cover the period of from one to sixty seconds) an important question is whether or not retention is influenced by factors known to be important in long-term memory. One such factor is retroactive interference. Broadbent1 has asserted that retention depends on the duration of the delay rather than the nature of any activity during the delay. But he rests his case on evidence that retention is impaired by increasing the delay while keeping the activity as constant as possible. Direct evidence that variation of the intervening activity is ineffective has been lacking, but Baddeley and Dale2 have shown that in minimal paired-associate learning3 meaningful similarity fails to affect performance significantly, and this supports Broadbent's contention."

The fungistatic effect is not attributable to antimetabolic action and is not caused by lysozyme or tears, neither of which inhibit growth and viability of Candida albicans."

https://openalex.org/W2024269859,"SOME authors1–3 have reported that saline preparations of vaccinia virus, when mixed with suitable suspensions of red cells from certain adult fowls, caused haemagglutination, which could be inhibited by antiserum to vaccinia. Only 50 per cent of the fowls were found to have cells agglutinable with vaccinia virus and the phenomenon appeared to operate independently of breed, sex or age."
https://openalex.org/W2029103145,"IT is well known that irradiation causes death of the progeny of adult irradiated animals. For example, Osipovskii1 found that the death-rate of the progeny of males irradiated with an X-ray dose of 360 r. reaches 53 per cent. Hertwig2 found that the percentage of dead progeny in the period from their birth to the seventy-fifth day of age is considerably higher than later. Strandskow3 also found an increased death-rate in the progeny of irradiated male guinea pigs for the period up to 30 days of age. Henson3 also observed the death-rate of the progeny of male rats irradiated with an X-ray dose of 100–1,000 r. during their lactation period. It has been found that 46 per cent of the progeny live until the end of the lactation period. Observing the changes on the progeny of male mice irradiated with 25 MeV through five generations, Proshina4 found the highest death-rate in the first generation and in the first month of life."
https://openalex.org/W2135245137,But there is one general line of reasoning which is having a major impact on leaders in the underdeveloped areas: it is demonstrable that current rates of population growth are slowing down economic development and that a reduction in the rate of growth would have substantial salutary consequences for the economy. This argument does not imply that population control is a substitute for the usual ingredients of modernization--education industrialization technological development and so forth--but that it will enable underdeveloped countries to take full advantage of such developments and make it possible for them to add to their per capita wealth and productivity.
